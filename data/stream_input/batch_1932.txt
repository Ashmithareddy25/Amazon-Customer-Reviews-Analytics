B004DLPXAO|4.0|Works well for smartphones and tablets alike with a great selection of books, many of which are free. To use it you will need an account here with a credit card on file though.
B000JMKQX0|3.0|If you are more into character development and less into a documentary then this book is not for you. It was an OK read I suppose.
B0096BIENY|4.0|Il Divo is one of my favorites and this one is fine, but an earlier  CD  of theirs, I like a little better.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|i enjoyed this cd plannig to buy more of her music.  mostly christmas music she has a distinguished voice. missing her
B006LSZECO|5.0|Funny yet suspenseful; surprises and suspicions throughout; two timelines very effective for the storyline; the author does a great job of expressing the male and female viewpoints.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|The book is written from the perspective of individuals that lived through the WWII era. It continues the thread of families from the Fall of Giants. I would reccomend this book for people who enjoy learning history from a persnal point of view.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|A very funny film that is great for the whole family! I would definitely reccomend it. Everyone will have an enjoyable time watching this hilarious movie.
B007T7MIR0|5.0|I used this app on my cell phone and andriod tablet since there is no version of words, plus it free
B002UPA4ZY|5.0|This such a wonderful DVD. Andrea Bocelli is such a gifted singer. I enjoyed every song and every guest from Reba McIntire to the Muppets. The Lord's Prayer with the Mormon Tabernacle Choir brought my to tears. LOVE IT!
B00466HNHM|2.0|Great movie, but this DVD shows up way too dark.  It was frustrating in certain scenes to barley see all that was going on.  I have seen this movie in the theater and on TV, all were fine but not the DVD.<br /><br />I would not recommend this movie on DVD.
B008IJTFYW|5.0|this app is great! I love that you &ccedil;an combine sounds,  right now I like wind &amp; chimes,  puts me right to sleep!
B009HEJXFS|5.0|I liked it as much as the first one.  Explains things that were unknown in past films.  Rent it or buy it you'll love it.
B00A4YVHXQ|5.0|We all had fun playing Piano Master Christmas Special. We would see if the others knew what we played. The sound is good on the game.
B004DK5CW4|5.0|Best horse movie ever !!!!!!!!!!!!!!  I love this movie.  I have watched the ending at least 10 times.  Exciting and fabulous
B008K8VDPU|5.0|It is a fun game and my granddaughter loves it. I have a hard time getting my kindle back from her.
B00280LYHS|5.0|I must have read this book six times!<br />It's funny, entertaining, everything I want<br />In a book can't stop reading it as a<br />matter a fact I just finished it just now lol<br />This is my favorite book in the entire series<br />No joke this book is awesome<br />well done as always Rick Riordan and bye<br />The way good job on the latest book<br />Mark Of Athena can't wait till the next book<br />comes out me and my mom keep arguing<br />on who gonna read it first (it's gonna be me)<br />Good luck I love the book already.
B002W5UVSM|2.0|This book starts out haltingly, then slows down.  Apparently the dunces are those of us who bought it.  It violates the first rule of  humor - it's not funny.  I'll never be able to get back the time I wasted reading it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|My kids and adults have found this game very fun and stimulating. Keeps the kids busy for hours just using their brain
B005LAIIQC|4.0|If you like the Bourne series, you'll like this one. Fleshes out the background a bit more. However, you might just see more of the same.
1932907009|5.0|I good book to have on your book shelf if you write family and comedies.  I knew the writer and he was a good man.  Honest.  Funny.  RIP Blake.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|Not only was this book a great read, it has been an inspiration. I'm totally psyched to rev up my running again!
B0092SQBJA|4.0|I give 4 stars on this album only because I loved the previous one more!  I can see (and hear) that this group is evolving, and I am very excited to see what they come up with in the future.  Two Door Cinema Club is excellent music!
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I Love my kindle. Its hard to keep it our of my kids hands but I've actually been able to read some books that I wouldn't have had the opportunity to read without my kindle
B001OGRQAQ|5.0|I would say it, but it has already been said.  If you want to know good music, join the Talking Heads!
145162445X|4.0|It is a very good mix of good science and philosophy. Regarding the problem of how life originnated in this planet, I would recomend the author to read &#34;Life Ascending&#34; of Nick Lane that your company edit and distribute. v.t.y José Vargas G.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's even better knowing that it's free. I use it to keep my work day and weekend alarms separated, and it's so easy to set up and use.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|Steinbeck captures the simple truths about humanity in a compelling and intriguing story.  I hadn't read any of his other books, and now I look forward to them all.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|This is a great book, it has the same vampire theme but told in a different setting. This book got a 5 from me because it's a book with action, romance, and a plot that actually makes sense. A lot of people will rate this book 1 or 2 stars because they compare it to books like twilight. Sorry but this book isn't twilight, it isn't about a girl and a guy. The plot is hard to understand till the last 100 pages when she finally accepts who and what she is. If you want a good book that isn't just about 2 people having sex, I recommend you read this book series.
0753539470|4.0|A good read to encourage positive thinking and avoid useless pessimism.  I enjoyed reading it.  Might be a good read for people who see the empty half of the glass.
B008S4YZCO|5.0|Omg i love This app. Its really super fun and right now i just downloaded it and im already on level 8! I have a diggster and the penguin. My only complaint is that on my bffs moms jpad, you can change the name. On this version you cant. :( i have not experienced any glitches people are talking about. Luv this game!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|Clark, I don't want to spend the holidays DEAD.....<br /><br />Now part of our annual holiday viewing. Arrived on time and at a fair price...<br /><br />Great job Amazon....again!
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is sweet and amazing. I have been to Oriental NC and it is amazing. This story is touching and I would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B000641D2Y|5.0|Must have Christmas classic!  Arrived on time at a fair price and is now part of our annual movie viewing
B000VZUWZW|5.0|I love the shows Sheldon Cooper is my favorite character in the show the big bang theory in all episodes.
B007HACDLK|5.0|The author kept me guessing who the real villain was until two-thirds of the book was read. Had a hard time putting it down each time that I had other matters to take care of. A very suspenseful well-written novel.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It was great a very amazing book with great details an  I am very excited to see what happens in mockingjay
B0095J0AL6|5.0|My wife had already bought the regular version of this CD for our daughter, but when we saw the Deluxe US Yearbook Edition we decided to order this and return the first one we bought. Item was exactly as described, and arrived quickly. I would definitely buy from seller again.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|It deserves its five stars from page one to the end. The book grabs you and never lets go! Any one will love this book but not as much as someone like me.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I have AccuWeather on my phone and on my Kindle Fire and I like the look and browsing much better from my Kindle. I now get my area every time rather than having to input my zip code each time. AccuWeather is as accurate as a weather app can be, glad I added it and I use it regularly.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I liked this book very much it was really funny and it was really funny when Rowley dressed as Joshie!
B008Y7DV70|5.0|The story is interesting, the characters are engaging, and the production values are good. There is one plot hole about the guy's brother that turns up late in the film, but that alone doesn't take it down a star in my mind. There is a lot of schlock on instant watch (here and elsewhere) and I'm always happy when I find something that's actually worth seeing.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|This game was fun but difficult. I know it gives you ideas on how to create things but it was really frustrating when I couldn't figure out the correct combination to make the piggie hit the end mark. I am going to stick with Angry Birds.
0761171703|4.0|What is interesting is that these images are not photoshopped or contrived in their finality; and the idea of photographing dancers in everyday settings and events is quite unique and creative.<br /><br />Many of the photos are &#34;really cool&#34;, as my family said repeatedly. Several come to mind as I write this, and will stay in my mind possibly forever.<br /><br />But after flipping through it once, and then casually once again, I was finished; it is not a book I will return to, or rate too highly as a book of photographs (like, for example, a LIFE photo compilation book). You will enjoy it VERY much, but when you're done, you're done. Tie it up with a red ribbon to match the cover, and gift it.
B007T9UIMA|5.0|it was a great gift for my fiance little sis, i'd prefer a better packaging but is ok, i recomend it
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book is amazing. I really don't have any other words for it. READ IT!!!! Page after page it gets better and better, and it's definitely one you can't put down.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book.  At first I thought it was a high school type romance novel, which I wasn't interested in.  But quickly realized there is a much deeper story.  Loved it.
6305388458|1.0|I realize I'm going to take a few shots for saying this, but here goes. This movie is over-rated IMO. I'm a Python fan dating to the early '70s. I get them. I laugh out loud at them. I think Graham Chapman is one of the half-dozen funniest performers of the 20th century. I'm not keen on one or two members but big deal, they're a troupe. Somehow I missed this film until last night. I hit \\"Play\\" with delightful anticipation. Well, it seems to me to be amazingly unfunny. I laughed twice. I love what they're attempting - poking fun at things that need to be poked - organized religion, religious zealotry, the Roman Empire, etc. - but their efforts fall flat IMO. The exemplar of this for me is the endless minutes devoted to \\"biggus dickus.\\" I emphasize \\"IMO.\\" Humor is a really  personal thing, needless to say.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this app is awesome dont belive the on star  rate  its fun and the picture is cool! best running game besides temple run and its free!
B0043VDIAG|4.0|It's Nicholas Sparks. You know there's a happy ending at the end of the rainbow. Another nicely written meander to a romantic sunset embrace and happily ever after. Great escapism.
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|I enjoyed the action and story as in previous movies certain characters came back into action. Now that Alice has her power back I look forward to more resident evil movies.
B008CFN95I|5.0|I really enjoyed this quirky tale of a secret society with a San Francisco storefront. The narrative was really interesting, the characters were unique, the plot twisted in ways that I didn't anticipate and I found the ending unexpected and very enjoyable. Would recommend to others.
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|I am still looking for the basic Burning Monkey tile layout, which apparently is quite hard to find.<br />This has lots of layouts and many different tile faces, but I just loved the original layout I was used to.<br />But, what the heck, I'll still play it. It works well on my Kindle Fire HD.
B005H0IW6W|3.0|&#34;Christmas&#34; by Michael Bubl'e was a good album for the holidays. His singing was fair, nothing exciting. I enjoy his vibe but it didn't grab me in this album. Like I said, nice to have for the holidays.
B009VB7QQA|4.0|This movie was so much better than I expected.  It had lots of action and the ridiculous premise was actually a lot of fun.  The guy who plays Lincoln looks like he could be Liam Neeson's son!
B0070Y46UY|3.0|After a while the story got a smidgen redundant...I would have liked it better if there were more about what happened after his rescue.
B00ARAN9JW|1.0|I found this very difficult to watch.  I love the resident evil series, but they keep getting worse and worse.  The special effects are cheesy and the premise is just getting ridiculous.  Dont spend any money on this movie!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book just wish I could get the next book right now!! I definitely recommend it as a series to read.
B009NQKXYK|3.0|This movie had such potential but such poor execution.  I was VERY bummed out by the way they presented the whole story.  FAIL.
B004DM0UII|4.0|every body must use. even though i can't find the channel i want, i still recommend people to use it, it's really good!
B0051OZ564|4.0|There is a depth to the story and the acting is more than just competent.  However, the strength of the film is it's gorgeous visuals in the fantasy sequences.  The swordplay and combat are far more fantasy Kung-Fu movie rather than accurate and historical.<br /><br />The music is used well to punctuate the scenes and strengthen the emotions the scene intends to deliver.<br /><br />Thought it's not for everyone it's a bit of an Alice in Wonderland with machine guns and katanas. If you find yourself shaking your head at that statement then you will probably not be thrilled with this film.  If you were intrigued then you should enjoy this movie.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This was an amazing book it inspired me to run more and do it for the smile it puts on my face.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Every time I beat a puzzle I like to yell that I'm the smartest person ever born. Haha. Seriously though super fun super addicting.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|Cute game, very addictive. I just wish the little people that come in the restaurant were more diverse along with the hostess. Other than that I love the game.
B00AAX68HG|3.0|The game is fun and adorable, but the game's touch response seems off --like it's not calibrated or something. The ads are a little obtrusive too, but what can you expect from a free version?
B007T7CJZ6|5.0|If you like Peter Gabriel, this is a must have CD. The orchestral performances knock his music out of the park. I find myself listening to this more and more! I just can't get enough. If you don't know Peter Gabriel, then buy this for the sheer beauty of the music. It is Gorgeous. Take a listen!
B009329ZF2|4.0|For me starts a little slow but before long you are involved in a very Navy picture... Special effects are fantastic and draw you into the films bettle scenes  Recommended to buy or at least rent.
B005S7GT32|4.0|Peter Gabriel has decided to remake many of his hit songs; but this time with an orchestra. He sings his lyrics with new inflection and meaning, and the orchestra behind add a rich new feel to his hit music. I really like this album. That said, I think Live Blood is a better performance. So check that out as well.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|Perfect conclusion the the Trilogy &#34;Dark Knight&#34; series. Lots of action and pretty good special effects. Realistic fight scenes and shows Batman and his human side, physically. Recommended.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|More about life and love than it is about football. I really was touched by this movie and loved that it was a true story! Some people really rock.
B005VOXQFQ|5.0|This giant panda is adorable as any I have seen.  The shipping was speedy and there were no problems at all.  Thank you for providing this Schleich toy.
B0026PW67W|5.0|This was a great gift for Harry Potter lovers<br />price and shipping were great even during the holiday season<br />would order again if I needed more
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I enjoyed it from cover to cover!!! I did not want to see it end!!!! Awesome storyline, characters and ending!
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|If you're into raunchy its good (i laughed). The problem is all the funny parts were in the preview ads on TV, the rest of the movie is mediocre at best. It should have been a 30 minute TV spot not a movie.
B003L77G06|5.0|Every show in this season just as funny as the next. Every family can relate to the three families in the series. The Halloween episode stands out as my favorite.
B00337KM2S|4.0|I like this movie, also satisfied with this product, and mailing on time, but it should be a bit cheaper.
B005LAIGW8|2.0|Awful plot. Ghost Rider has become a total whimp and barely speaks at all. Terrible dialog with bad acting by nick cage. it was so.bad we turned it off.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|the font is WAY too small and  I can't find any way to make it  bigger!  the size is better on my iPhone than it is on my kindle .  :-(
B003L77GRO|4.0|we really liked the whole motivational scam artist concept. The series is still original and the depth of the characters keeps.getting better.
B003L77GGA|5.0|Again, I bought this for my husband who is a big fan of Smallville. He loves this show and was happy.
B009VL28W2|5.0|Metallica always delivers with live dvds and this is no exception. the extra footage is from the second of the two shows that they played with the songs that were not played from the set list that was chosen by their fans. Damage Inc is the best!!!
B004EPYZSU|5.0|I bought this for my husband. He saw this on tv and he liked it so much that I surprised him with it on his birthday.
B005FISBTO|4.0|I liked this season with the whole book of revelations concept. It has a great i didnt see that coming twist in the middle.
B004UQPM4E|5.0|I bought this movie for my husband. He is the biggest fan of Superman and I knew that he would love this movie.
B002JVWQSW|5.0|We started watching this show in its third season and wanted to see the series from the beginning. My daughter and I actually turned watching season 1 into an all day marathon.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie was so sad.I saw it on tv and wanted it. I would frecommend this movie to anyone who loves dogs.
B00003CXTG|5.0|This was a real good buy.it includes two disc. My favorite movie.can not beat the price and value.<br />I will order more DVD's from this sorce.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is very interesting and addictive. My daughter got me involved with this game and her friends at work recommended it to her.
B001CMSTBM|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing these guys at the House of Blues in Houston on New Years Eve. Went to see Reckless Kelly and was blown away by Whiskey Myers. I haven't stopped listening to this CD for 4 days. I look forward to seeing them next time they're in town.
B00382S9N2|5.0|I love watching Dirty Dancing. I loved Patrick Swayze in this movie and will miss him. My daughter and I love this movie.
B000UZPIAW|5.0|Really shows the struggles addicts go through. I look differently at addicts and the professionals that help. Over heartwarming and a happy ending!
B003DZX3US|5.0|This movie was very nice. When I have young ones come here I put it on for them and they sit and watch it.
B009RX7WTI|5.0|This was a gift. My daughter loves Grey's Anatomy so it's a Christmas gift every year I per-order the season.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I love doing puzzles. I havent gotten to play this yet because I am involved with other games I am playing.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Definitely a book that I would recommend to others.  The way the book is written is unusual, but you get used to flipping between the husband and wife.  I looked forward to each page to see what would happen next. Not a huge fan of the ending, but enjoyed the journey there
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I bought this movie for my grandson who loves woody.He sits on his chair and watches it so much andI love it too.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|What can I say about this; who doesn't like Adele?  This &#34;21&#34; is a great album with many beautiful songs..
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I tried playing this game but I have to get more involved with it. But now that the holidays are over I can start playing it again.
0316228532|5.0|I am usually offended by profanity, but she uses it not to shock, but to make a reality.  She also mostly stays away from using religious names and words as profanity. The story is convincingly real, and compelling. The humor is often about snobbery which deserves to be laughed at!
B000TM1CL0|5.0|I bought this for my husband who liked watching Shark. When they took it  off the air he was disappointed but now he can watch it.
0525953728|5.0|This is an extremely well written story, not only of the tracking and killing of Osama Bin Laden, but also of the unbelievably harsh trials that SEALs and those on SEAL Team 6 endure just to join the most elite military squad in the world
B005IZLPMY|5.0|I bought this for my husband who like Captain America. He loves all kinds of super heroes and he loves this dvd.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Game is fun to play. Great graphics on my kindle fire hd. Voice acting could use some work. Overall a good game.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Charles Dickens was always a good writer. All his story's are good reading. Read it your self if you haven't.
B009X01C64|2.0|This case looks nice but it smelled very badly of chemicals.  It gave me a headache to use it. Back it went.
0547884591|5.0|Tim has an entertaining style of writing. He introduces many topics and ties them together very well. The cooking section seems to be really useful to beginner cooks and even somebody who has a lot of cooking experience.<br /><br />I'm only halfway through and I feel like I got my money's worth.
141694737X|5.0|This is hands down my toddlers favorite book. We have to read it about 5 times every night. He loves lifting up the flaps on the book to find out what animal is coming up next in the story. So glad I bought this book for him.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|I'm digging the supernatural world she created. Such detail. There were points when I literally couldn't wait to read the next page.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|fun entertaining tricky game a lot like treasure of Montezuma different on the multiplier deals but much easier skill level required so give it a try
B004DM0UII|1.0|Why does a music app need so much access to the data (including protected data) on my phone? Beware of &quot;Sticky Notes&quot; That software gives the developer access to your data at any time and as a many times as they need. Also, why does it need to be on &quot;start up&quot;?
B009VB7QQA|4.0|To say the least!  Decent take on Abe Lincoln and the time frame he was alive.  Definitely would watch again and recommend to friends.
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Ok, now the story is finally coming together and Helen has finally, really, been put to rest but still there are three plots still active. The biggest problem with the Pendergast series is having to wait for the next one. I curse Preston & Child for the cliff hangers and waiting. But I do love the book and the series.
0385535147|3.0|In the past, I used to read John Grisham's books with interest. But now, I rarely read his books . That is because some of his latest books haven't been as thrilling and suspenseful as some of his earlier works. However, when I learned of the newly released \\"The Racketeer,\\" I decided to purchase and read it.<br /><br />This book is about a disbarred lawyer, Malcolm Bannister, who is serving time in a federal prison for money laundering. He maintains that he is innocent, and he harbors a grudge against the federal government for prosecuting him. While he's in prison, a chain of events occurs after a federal judge is murdered. That results in Bannister making a deal with the government, which results in his release. Once he is freed, he enters the witness protection program, then abandons it. He then goes about scheming and deceiving the federal government to secure a reward, which is ultimately the driving force behind everything that he has done.<br /><br />Throughout the book, as the plot developed, I was often unsure as to who the good and bad people were. Some people appeared to be innocent but were villains, while others were villains who appeared to be innocent. That made the book suspenseful, and hard to put down. I read the book quickly because I did not want to delay discovering how it ended. Despite that, the suspense make the book interesting, but the book did not contain the depth that I would have desired.
B0091WAN3C|5.0|Excellent movie I can watch over and over.  The Amazon Prime download is great as I can watch it on my ipad when ever I am traveling without internet access. simple download from amazon
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book is a 5 because it has excellent word choice and has excellent details and is extremely funny  3rd book of the hero of Olympus seiries. The prophecy comes true in a dramatic way.
B007TVANDM|5.0|My son loves this book, great message.<br />Flows very well, colors and attitude.  More and more there are books lacking a positive message.
B0063IH60K|3.0|Another version of solitaire that will alternate with your other versions... nothing special but not bad either .. check it out
0439023491|1.0|I order this book on Jan 2nd through my prime membership and it has still NOT shipped on Jan 5th. Both other items I order on the 2nd have already arrived. This is not acceptable.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this is a good spatial relationship game where you have to see through a maze to complete the level.. excellent
B000KIRT6A|4.0|Even set at 0 it gives the signal a good boost without adding noise to my signal chain. Might be good at the front of the chain as a preamp.  each slider is decently effective at modifying the tone.<br />Because Behringer makes these out of plastic...you feel like you don't want to 'stomp' on these pedals but I guess it really doesn't matter in this case because EQ usually stays on the entire time you use it.  Just turn on and leave it.<br />I'd buy again.  In fact, I'll probably order another one for my second loop(acoustic) and recommend it to a few friends.
B006R1T40I|5.0|A continuation of a fantastic musical career. Bonnie never lets us down and I listen to this often.. in fact it has a home in my Harley's CD player
B001383XT8|3.0|I've bought several Behringer pedals at this point, mostly for younger players in need of a start....I'm surprised at how often I'm impressed at this price point.  For $25=/- a couple bucks, you can really get a lot of sound out of these units.  No, they're not boutique quality, certainly not in the build quality, but for entry level they really are decent.<br /><br />think of it as the gateway drug.<br /><br />Meanwhile Behringer is making tons of money providing simple but effective pedals.<br /><br />Back to this pedal.  Has a nice high gain structure with decent touch sensitivity when plugged into a tube amp.  Really not bad for metal work.  Not a pedal i would use for light touch overdrive work though.  I haven't tried their OD pedal yet.<br />For context, I'm comparing these to OCD and Modtone pedals for distortion and overdrive.  Always recommend an EQ pedal and they make one of those too.
0345529057|5.0|recommendation from Castle TV characters... good one, as it turns out, but unless you're a full time reader, it will be with you for a loooooong time!
B008HK3XOU|4.0|Ok. Nice  & lightweight.  So far does what it supposed to. Over priced for what it is but a lot cheaper than the recommended leather one.
0767800958|5.0|you'll love this movie... two very different personalities come together because of their mutual love / respect for tango. Good story, beautiful dancing.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|I guess I dont understand how people could think this was an acceptable story line.  Then the twist at the end was too much.  Complete joke.  I like good movies.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|I never bothered with this while it was on TV, but was cajoled into watching by a coworker... best suggestion I've ever made, and for those of us who want instant gratification, the best alternative to waiting a week for the next installment.
1449410243|5.0|i got one for my wife and she loved it!i got another for my neice for a christmas gift and she loves it. these books will be passed around the family,everyone loves cats and this book is funny!
B003L77G2Y|5.0|once a week just doesn't make it. great cohesive cast of characters that wend their way through amazing situations and come through mostly intact. always leaves you wanting more.

B001C4CI8U|5.0|who said there was nothing to look forward to on Friday nights? unfortunately, on TV, it's in one hour increments. on DVD, you can have your own marathon. sci fi at its most satisfying.
B008X8QCTO|5.0|This is a great game I got it for me and my son to play. We really like it a lot.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I absolutely love the Walking Dead! It is by far my favorite show and Season 3 just went over the top! So emotional and action packed.
B003Y5H4SO|5.0|short, but good scary movie, also in the uncomfortable category of 'this could happen'. you may not want to watch this one alone.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|A must read. This was a awesome read and I found that I could not put it down. If u started the series then u gotta read the end.
B000I9WWCM|5.0|not enough stars to rate one of my favorite movies of all time!!!! a movie with a definite happy ending with many terrific actors sharing this movies spotlight. its about love, crazy friendships, laughter and most of all, living outside your comfort zone. a film you can watch over and over and still find it charming!!
0316069434|4.0|He introduces the readers to the old ways of solving a murder using Index cards stored in a black box. I was just getting used to the murder books but have to admit that we I was investigating accidents or other large losses, I also used index cards  prior to the advent of the computer.<br />The story line is a classic Bosch mystery with lots of turns and twist and a surprise ending to the readers who assumed the ending to be in one direction.<br />Anyway, another great read. I always look forward to Connelly's new books. Tom Altvater
B009FZFONO|5.0|This is a great zombie series and I can't wait for the rest of the episodes to come available to amazon.  Most zombie movies/series tend to be cheesy or B movies but \\"The Walking Dead\\" is not and is well worth watching.
B0083Z614S|5.0|i really thoght this book was going to be a bore but seeing that it free i decided to give it a try and i am so glad i did!!! i highly recomend it
B007PVHMCG|1.0|My son put this Lego Minecraft on his amazon wish list for Christmas and his grandparents bought it for him. I never saw the price and they never mentioned it until my son opened his present. They were curious what make this paticular Lego is so expensive, they thought maybe it comes with Minecraft games that he could play in his computer. When they told me the price I almost fell over, when my son opened the Lego with only little Lego in it....I almost cried! $128 just for that little dinky Lego???? I just read a comment on a review justifying the price because it is hard to get..... I don't think so!
B0085Z3B2Q|5.0|Fantastic movie for a Christmas present! My brothers love having the DVD/Bluray and I got a digital copy all for myself as well.

B00AE2IJIE|4.0|Surprisingly good.  Well paced. Good story about persevering thru bullying and coming out on top. I and my family recommennd this movie.

B004Z7AHZC|5.0|Great family movie. My six yr old loves the book series and movie as well. Even my 2 yr old sat through the whole movie.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|freezes, crashes, couldn't even get past the sighing in part. when will there be a good facebook app for kindle???
0399160450|1.0|I don't know who wrote this book, but it wasn't Tom Clancy. Maybe it was Mark Greaney (without Tom Clancy's help) or some ghost writer. It certainly wasn't Tom Clancy. The man that wrote The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising didn't write this book. The writing of Threat Vector is the work of an amateur writer. The story telling and character development are poor even laughable. Whomever wrote The Hunt for Red October and Red Storm Rising was a professional story teller and writer. There is no way these three books came from the same person. I admit, I haven't read any of Tom Clancy's later works after Red Storm Rising, but there is no way the author of that book wrote this piece of trash. If Mr. Clancy isn't writing his own novels any more, then he needs to find a ghost writer that can honor the tradition of his good name. Save your money on this one folks. The premise is great, but the writing and story telling are poor.
B00A81MV3U|5.0|On temporary leave from a mental institution, our bi-polar hero is frantic to reconcile with his ex, but his parents, who have signed for custody and are on the hook for his behavior, are understandably worried. Particularly when he seems to be interacting with a troubled young widow who is no more predictable than he.<br /><br />In this engaging dramedy, we see a plot painted with broad strokes, but delivered by a cast capable of great skill and subtlety:<br />  * Bradley Cooper (\\"The Words\\") is Pat, absolutely convinced that only one \\"incident\\" caused his problem and it can easily be explained. Of course what he views as \\"normal\\" might be the issue here...that plus the restraining order his ex-wife has filed.<br />  * Jennifer Lawrence (\\"The Hunger Games\\") is Tiffany, a recent acquaintance with a questionable past, but it too, can be easily explained. This young widow is still working her way toward \\"normal.\\"<br />  * Robert De Niro (\\"Limitless\\") is Pat Sr., a cantankerous, controlling, obsessive compulsive, who wants to open a restaurant, but is willing to wager that his son won't let him down. From him we get a lot of insight into the family dynamics and what is considered \\"normal.\\"<br />  * Jacki Weaver (\\"The Five-Year Engagement\\") is Delores, the long-suffering wife and mother of our two favorite odd-balls. Chaos is \\"normal\\" for her.<br />  * Anupam Kher (\\"Bend it Like Beckham\\") is Dr. Cliff Patel, our hero's therapist...  and a sports fan! He's still trying to define \\"normal.\\"<br />  * Chris Tucker (the \\"Rush Hour\\" franchise) is Danny, escape artist par excellence! He met our hero in the mental institution; Danny may be crazy, but he's not dumb!<br /><br />It is disconcerting to see a person deliberately refuse his medications, so I had a lot of misgivings about a movie that seems to endorse that behavior. On the other hand, we could see that the OCD apple didn't fall very far from the tree. I can only say that our hero's mother deserves to have her ample chest covered with medals!<br /><br />In this R-rated film, expect lots of profanity, a glimpse of (maybe) nudity, no sweaty bodies, no gunshots and no blowie uppie stuff (except tempers, e.g., watch our hero when he finishes Ernest Hemingway's A Farewell to Arms!). Also expect to have people to root for, and an improbable bet that features a point spread.<br /><br />Let me add that this movie includes the most memorable \\"lift\\" since \\"Dirty Dancing.\\"<br /><br />I've already pre-ordered this from Amazon.
B000Q9IZ5C|5.0|this is the perfect ending movie for any firefly fans out there . finishes off the story well does not leave you wanting more
B00ANT6OK8|5.0|About halfway through the filming of her military thriller about the CIA's hunt for terrorists, Academy Award winning Director Kathryn Bigelow (\\"The Hurt Locker\\") was stunned to learn that Osama bin Laden had been captured and killed. She immediately suspended her project and Mark Boal (\\"The Hurt Locker\\") began rewriting the script.<br /><br />Amid accusations that she (possibly) was given access to secret material, she shot and released this astonishing piece of R-rated film-making with blinding speed. Of course we already know how it ends, but it's a nail-biter just the same. And it IS based on real people; they even remembered to include the Malinois dog (a slightly smaller version of a German Shepherd).<br /><br />We see:<br />  * Jessica Chastain (\\"The Help\\") is the driven CIA agent who refuses to cut herself or anyone else any slack. She got this job right out of high school and it's the only life she knows. (You should hear how she describes herself!)<br />  * Mark Strong (\\"The Guard\\") practically steals this film from the top-billed stars. This British-born actor never ceases to amaze me: this time he's CIA (American!) and grabs our focus any time he's on camera.<br />  * Jason Clarke (\\"Lawless\\") is the CIA fellow tasked with the interrogation of prisoners. This Australian bloke will always work because he speaks American like a native.<br />  * Joel Edgerton (\\"Kinky Boots\\") is part of the Navy SEAL team and he believes in our heroine's \\"gut.\\" Edgerton is another Aussie.<br />  * Chris Pratt (\\"Money Ball\\") brings his trademark genial likability to his role as part of the SEAL team. So much of their raid has them swathed in night-vision goggles and all the paraphernalia they need that they are virtually unrecognizable, but I knew his voice.<br />  * Reda Kateb (\\"Three Worlds\\") is the operative who is subjected to water-boarding. The scene wasn't as horrific as I had feared, although I certainly wouldn't want it done to ME!<br />  * Kyle Chandler (\\"Super 8\\") is our heroine's boss in Afghanistan. To him, she is a major pain because she doesn't know how to quit.<br />  * Jennifer Ehle (\\"Contagion\\") is her only friend in the CIA. As a rule, Ms. Ehle speaks flawless American but one scene shocked me because there was NO attempt to disguise her British pronunciation. Hmmm.... Oh well, this was made in a rush...<br /><br />It's amazing how iconic a simple, three-story white building in Abbottabad, Pakistan has become. We all recognize it instantly! And the claustrophobic scenes inside are grim. Expect bits of humor, no sweaty bodies, plenty of gunfire and (remember we are dealing with suicide bombers!) lots of blowie uppie stuff.<br /><br />Amazon will notify me when it's available to order.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this is the complete series and it was great. perfect for catching up on what you had forgotten and if you have never seen the series and like space shows or NATHAN FILLION aka Castle watch these shows . they are worth the time and will get you ready to watch Serenity the final in the set .
B0031RAOVY|5.0|If you want a movie that will touch your heart....whether you are an animal lover or not......this movie is for MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN.  TRUELY UNCONDITIONAL LOVE.
B0085P2Z6E|5.0|I can't get enough of this game!  Great graphics, soothing music and fun for the whole family!  I enjoy it, but I wish there were more levels.
B004DM0UII|1.0|this app was ok at first then even when my kindle is turned off it went on when I tried to turn it off it would not work, thus I had no option but to delete it.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Fantastic.  I cannot say enough about this book. Once I started it I never stopped and I wished it went on forever. Thank you Colleen for sharing your gift.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I love Brave!  The movie was cute, funny, scary in some parts and it teaches you a lesson.  I will watch it over & over.
B004FGMDOQ|4.0|I must admit I am not an avid horror fiction fan, however I found this a very good read. It was just frightening enough to make it difficult to put down but not downright scary. To those who truly love horror fiction it may be a bit feeble, but for anyone else I think it's great. Very well written, well paced, and with intriguing characters and some nice plot twists.
B002KYHZLQ|4.0|So I wanted some meaty, immersive fantasy, and this series really delivers!  I love the world, the magic system, and the characters.  At times dark, and then surpisingly humerous, the books are never boring.  There are also a lot of them, and they're all pretty long, so it should hold you for a while.<br /><br />There are two things worth noting.  The books are long, jump around a lot, and have a huge cast of characters, places, deities, etc.  This is of course a large part of the appeal, but it can be a challenge to keep it all straight.  There is a dramatis personae and glossary, but it is altogether too short on detail to be really helpful.<br /><br />What is annoying is that the first book is $7.99, and the rest are all $9.99.  I hate teaser rates, the first hooked me and now I'm paying way too much for these books.  There are a lot of them, so you should know that going in.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I couldn't stop playing. Great search and find but the story line and puzzle solving keep you 'entranced' throughout the entire game.  As an extra little feature you get a pet monkey that helps you along the way.

B008XX6J4C|5.0|I listened to every song that I found on-line.  This album has many of my favorites, but I will buy more Piano Guys albums, too.<br />I wish that the videos were available on disc.  I would buy them all!!  I was amazed at the speed my CD was dispatched to my door!  This is a Christmas present to myself from me, and I am a happy, happy receipient!!  Thank you!
1452101248|5.0|This vegetarian cookbook appealed to me so much because the recipes are very well done and also obtainable. The use of spices and produce completely speaks to the way I like to cook and what I enjoy eating.
B000006TRV|5.0|This is a double audio CD.........last recording with Roger Waters in the band.  Great music to listen to or sing along with :)
B000SW4DXK|5.0|Love this movie it shows great and the store is wonderful for the young children will keep them focus it a Christmas store of course about believing in Santa.
1451695195|5.0|I was fascinated by this book because of the topic and the fact that it was written by an icon of the scientific world.  It certainly is a refreshing change from the dismissive views expressed by Sagan and Hawking in their books.  More importantly, it is a message of hope for all, regardless of their current feelings about faith.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Great Sense of humor, simple to play.  I am interested in similar apps to this one if available.<br />It konked out once.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|Why does the combination of Al Stewart and Alan Parsons work so well? I have no idea, but it does. The production and recording are breathtaking. The performances are inspired - and flawless. That's typically not a combination of adjectives that I would put together as it pertains to music. Usually inspired and &#34;raw&#34;. Or flawless and &#34;cold&#34;. Not here.<br />I listened to TP and YotC in college on vinyl borrowed from my friends....but I was never motivated to buy it. Now over 30 years later, it's floated to the top of my playlist.<br />To the companies who remaster analog masters on 96/24bit up to 192/24bit, this and Year of the Cat should be at the top of your list. Do humanity a favor!
B007IL5B6C|5.0|I used to watch him swimming even when the competition was at night (my zone time) now i like him even more. Love that book as well :)
B007XH6BPG|5.0|While I am a Chris Squire fan - and I am a fan of Gabriel/Hackett era Genesis, I didn't think this would work. For example,  I'm not crazy about the Squire/Sherwood albums. However, Life Within a Day works. I get a true sense of each artist in all of the songs presented on this CD. But this work is an acquired taste - sort of like learning to appreciate early Genesis songs. It took several listens before &#34;I got it&#34;. The songs are interesting, the production is good, the performances are good, and the recording is good. For those fans of traditional prog, I think you'll like this.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This book was suspenseful right up until the end, which made a great story. The book had me on the edge of my sea and was a real nail biter.

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was so captivating! I loved the story and the realistic factors that went along with it. It kept me guessing until the very last page! Wonderful book!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Its not free. Once you really get into it, part way through, they ask for a $2.99 payment to continue. Wish I would have known or I wouldn't have bothered downloading ..
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|Don't get me wrong it is a fun app, especially when playing with a friend. I give it a three because the game modes are limited. It is a good time passer game. If you are looking for a good two player game I highly recommend it.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|This book is very well written. It contains some high vocab words but it still a good read!  But, if you don't like sad endings,  don't read this series!
159420411X|5.0|Today's (Jan. 4, 2013) Washington Post contains an article headed \\"Forecast for Greece was wrong, IMF official says.\\" The story goes on to discuss how the IMF blew its forecasts for Greece and imposed too high a level of austerity on it. True to Nate Silver's sage warnings,  IMF experts misunderstood the fact that financial multipliers employed in their complex econometric models are generated as a result of the model's behavior (output) not its structure (input assumptions). Consequently, the numbers used in the austerity level forecast were mistaken and the austerity level far too harsh and counterproductive.<br /><br />Reading the article, I was reminded of the book's deft handling of the need for combining both human understanding and computer intelligence to come up with the best possible predictions. Silver presents this case with numerous examples each with sufficient depth to gain insight into the strengths and limitations of predictive models. Although he doesn't go deeper into the development of such models, he does prepare the ground for the reader to pursue other books that do cover related technical subjects. For example, books on modeling and simulation, such as [[ASIN:085729864X Guide to Modeling and Simulation of Systems of Systems (Simulation Foundations, Methods and Applications)]], discuss the development of models of complex systems (exemplified by those discussed by Silver) that enable realistic simulation and prediction of events. Books on Stochastic simulation such as [[ASIN:1584885874 Markov Chain Monte Carlo: Stochastic Simulation for Bayesian Inference, Second Edition (Chapman & Hall/CRC Texts in Statistical Science)]], show how to incorporate randomness in a controlled manner to test the robustness of model predictions and gain insight into \\"unknown unknowns\\".<br /><br />Within the context of the literature on modeling and simulation methodology, Nate Silver's book offers a most enlightening, and well expressed, set of insights into the forecasting and prediction that are increasingly affecting the way we live.
B00AAQUCAM|4.0|I really love the 88 band.. so I am biased.  I think this is my second favorite release from the 88 band.. the other two being Broadway the Hardway, and Make A Jazz Noise Here (my favorite).<br /><br />This is full of great guitar playing, see smoking Heavy Duty Judy, and jolly good humor.  Even though this band fell apart due to the inner band bickering, you would not know it from this release.  Everyone seems happy.  All the laughing during the 'Jimmy Swaggart' songs is infectious to the listener.<br /><br />Some of the great FZ songs in this set are beset with some very good cover songs 'Bolero' being just one of them.<br /><br />If you like very good songs, with very good live performances, you can't go wrong with this purchase.<br /><br />It has always made me giggle and amazed all at the same time.<br /><br />Mondo
B008WCP2PG|2.0|I'm not sure what they were trying to achieve with 'Magic Mike' but it turns out to be neither fish nor fowl -- and watching Matthew McConaughey chew up the scenery got tedious very, very quickly.
B004LWZWGK|1.0|Waste of time and money.  This movie was made for brain dead idiots. Corny and predictable. What a shame so much talent and funds were spent on such crap.
0756914582|1.0|While this is a great work of literature, the &#34;hardback&#34; edition I purchased was the crappy paperback edition with some hard cardboard covers slapped on. Labeling this edition &#34;hardback&#34; is an act of fraud. Whoever allowed this to happen should be deeply ashamed and drummed out of the publishing business. I ended up returning this and going to Alibris to buy a true hardback edition from a charity that supports local libraries.
B005LAIHE0|1.0|This movie was a complete waste of time and seemingly talented actors. It was so bad my wife and I were unable to finish it. A trainwreck by all accounts. Don't waste your money or time on this garbage.
B00004YYDI|3.0|Unless I'm mistaken Natalie Portmanteau was only 12 when she took this role, her first, as Mathilda the young girl orphaned by crooked cop Gary Oldman, and reluctantly taken in by Jean Reno. Little Miss Portman handled herself very well in this role even, at one point, handling and stripping down a pistol in a very natural practiced manner. &#34;Cop&#34; Oldman was good at his role too,his character finally getting what he deserved, costing Reno his life in the process(Jean Reno was also good as the killer who reluctantly took a little girl in and came to love her as if she were his own daughter.).<br /><br />I don't think I've seen the U.S. &#34;cut&#34; so I'm not sure of the differences but for me the movie version as I remember it had a weak ending with Portman going off to boarding school, paid for out of Reno's money by mob banker Danny Aiello. The silliest part of that was when she planted the potted plant Reno was always protecting ( when not saving her), on the school lawn, keeping it in her room would've made more sense.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|If you've seen the trailer than consider it the best part of the movie what a complete waist of time and money
B00AIQP9DE|2.0|Fun until it abruptly ended.  Pay to continue.  Decent graphics.  Interesting story.  But can't get to the end without forking over 2.99.
B009IJJ5B4|4.0|Highly recommeded chemically charged update with Holmes & Watson now in NYC....oh yeah and Watson is now the lovely  Lucy Liu!
B00ABXA1HI|5.0|This product is awesome for using your home wifi to connect your Kindle 8.9 to tour home computer; with all your computer's functionality.  The videostreams are near flawless.
B0097L29KM|4.0|I bought this for my husband for Christmas at his request.  He loves the entire contents and appreciates that it came out on vinyl since he has a collection of well over 1,000 records.  He appreciates the quality of vinyl sound - having more depth.<br /><br />The only reason he does not give it all the stars in the rating  is that in several places on the three-record album, there is a &#34;bump&#34; sound on the record - like some kind of damage in proessing.<br /><br />My husband asked me to type this for him since I'm more familiar with the keyboard.
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|A friend of mine thought this was a funny movie and recommended it. This friend is a fine  individual, but he uses the F.. word liberally. This guy has a Ph.D. and owns an IT company. I feel like asking him how on earth could have found this piece of garbage worth his time. Nonetheless, I started watching this movie, and could not get very far. I had to turn if off. What a bunch of utter vulgar trash! This is not what I consider good entertainment. I love good comedy, but not this kind of thing. There should be zero star, as this thing deserves a zero, even &lt; 0! I suggest that you don't waste your time or money on this one.
B008Z9YLV2|4.0|This movie was good but not as good as I thought it would be. Still would recommend you see it.
1419707663|5.0|Great books that will encourage a child to read. They are an easy read for the young reader with story lines that capture and hold their attention.  If my grandson enjoys them then I'll buy him some more in the series.
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Very well done.  One of the best movies I've seen recently.  A little graphic in places but does an excellent job of telling the story.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|Beautiful graphic work, hilarious script, and excellent acting.  Wanda Sykes was the perfect choice for Grandma!  Moves fast.  Will watch it again.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I didn't want to put this book down until I found out &#34;who done it.&#34; I read Gone Girl first, which was spectacular, so I thought I would give this one a try. Dark Places is almost better in some aspects-- Flynn is an excellent story-teller, but she also is brilliant at developing really interesting characters, using impeccable imagery and diction- beautiful prose.
B003ZA0BCY|5.0|An older date flick, but still enjoyable. Predictable, but fun, this is the type of movie you snuggle up with your loved one and watch.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This story definitley strikes fear and horror into the gut of any parent. The story is intriguing and the characters are genuine.
B00860YICC|5.0|This was a great  movie i really enjoyed it,  from start to finish i was intrigued , i am very happy that i bought it .
B0098VXE50|4.0|It wouldn't make my list of top 10 favorite movies but with the digital copy it was worth the purchase.

B005URRCUY|5.0|Great talent.  Who knew this cd would earn them 2 grammy's? Well earned, well  deserved, and well done!  Good job!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I really love this game, but it would be even better if they added the stuff from the pc version, like listings,saddles, spawn eggs, etc. All in all, though, it's terrific.<br /><br />P.S. ADD ENDERMEN, MOJANG!!!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This one makes you think the higher you get in the levels.  A good app to use your brain, and is more fun than frustrating like some brain games.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|addicting - lots of fun for me and my children. frustrating waiting for more coins. my 5 year old loves to play.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Pretty addictive. I like that this game is actually challenging compared to other games like it. It's kinda slow in the beginning but picks up after you gain some income.
B004VMUS9G|4.0|This app has basically replaced my home alarm clock. I like the ability to use a song and or an artist as the alarm sound as well as the variable volume ring. I wish the app would pop directly to the screen when it goes off rather than having to turn the kindle on and swipe the screen before hitting the snooze or dismiss button.
B000VBIGD6|5.0|funny typical chevy chase.

Been a fan since album #1, seen her in person, etc.<br /><br />Artists need to do what moves them musically, but I'm not sure if these last few efforts have been her, Elvis or the record company's idea...but they don't move me.  Now about that cover......

0767821629|5.0|If you consider that we are spiritual beings and there is life after physical death, then if you also consider our spirits are eternal, then we must also consider our spirits pre-existed this life. Therefore, this life is a game or simulation of reality, a place to learn and remember. This is the message of this film. Highly recommended. Thought provoking philosophy!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I can not believe how consuming, wonderful and well written this book was!  I loved EVERY single page and was not dissapointed with ANY part of it...  This is a story that COULD happen, probably HAS happened and will leave you feeling like it worked out the way it should have...  LOVED IT!
0895292211|5.0|A great explanation of how the body really works and that what we have been taught is our foundation for eating, is really not the complete truth.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|Family is not just about blood ties. The book provides insights into a family's existence under slavery and the kind people who break down those barriers.
B004XQO90O|5.0|The storyline is interesting and touches on what may be just under the surface of all our individual abilities. Certainly though provoking.
1400069289|5.0|The Power of Habit is extremely well-written and contains countless anecdotes to clearly communicate how habits influence our lives. It has helped me personally understand my own habits, and provides a clear framework for changing habits to align with your own life goals. If you read this carefully, and put in the work, you can expect to improve your results in your personal and professional lives as well as your relationships!<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone who is interested in making the most of his life, and has the drive to put in the required work!<br /><br />5 stars!
B005LAIGN2|5.0|Worth watching. These airmen did not get the credit due them for their sacrifices to their country and this shows of their honor.
B000076CY6|5.0|Putting this together was the first thing my nephew did after our gift exchange this year! He loved it and wants to complete this set!!
B006MW3V6U|5.0|We love the series and were grateful to find it on DVD so we could watch it again and again.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|I was hesitant about buying this after the previous model jammed all the time.  They have corrected the problems and now this bay is a thing of gold.  We have three and the amount of fire we lay down would even make the Marines envy.
B007MB5OCE|5.0|What a delightful read! I purchased this on a whim and fell in love with the story. The writing is engaging, and includes incredible twists and turns that make this novel a fun distraction. Thoroughly enjoyable, and I will look for more by this author.
1439130833|5.0|This transformed my Life. A must for every good willing person!. It creates really a fulfilling life! Try it out yourself!
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This product really helps keep dust and dirt in the unit. Also protects from scratched and damage. It's also a great price
B00009W0U4|4.0|Irreversible is exactly the type of adult drama that cinema fans in the US must seek outside the borders of our country.  In every way, Irreversible is a film for grown-ups only: the subject matter, the plot, the scenes, the images, the language.  Even today, ten plus year later, it is doubtful that this movie could be made here, with similar stars and quality.<br /><br />Director Gaspar Noe unabashedly channels Stanley Kubrick and applies a heavy hand to cause a reaction in the audience, especially in the violent scenes.  He uses a wide variety of techniques to do so, and film students may find Irreversible of interest purely from a technical perspective.  Non-film buffs should forget about trying to follow every aspect of the dialogue and scenes, and instead react to the imagery as Noe intends.<br /><br />One technique that Noe uses is long scenes shot with a single camera, which means the actors must go on and on with their dialogue and acting without benefit of a cut.  This creates quite a challenge, but one that Monica Bellucci and Vincent Cassel in particular succeed at.  This real-life husband and wife team has an especially long scene in an apartment, conducted mostly in the buff, that provides an incredibly intimate look into the on-screen relationship of their characters.  Another impressive scene is a frank three-way conversation on the Paris Metro with another character about intimate aspects of adult relationships.  These are the sorts of scenes that you just don't see in mainstream US cinema.<br /><br />Irreversible is not quite a masterpiece, but it is definitely recommended for US fans of foreign cinema.
B0039TAHMA|5.0|The Two Towers isn't my top favorite of the Lord of the Rings movies but it's still great. 5 out of 5
B004DM0UII|5.0|This is a really great well made app. It has a nice clean and easy to use interface. My local radio stations did not show up but with the wide range of international stations to choose from (as well as U.S stations) this wasn't a big issue for me. You can easily find a station based on multiple genres including sub- genres. Very enjoyable, I definitely recommend!
B00AMBLXP8|4.0|Ted is hilarious! I hope they make a sequel! If you like Family Guy, you will like Ted! Definitely recommend it!
B00A2AU0KI|5.0|Ending was typical but Clint plays a good old hard guy.  Cool movie and I would recommend it to anyone.
B00ADS98FC|4.0|Pitch Perfect is really funny. Great music. Great actors. Fat Amy is hilarious. Definitely worth checking out! Hope they make a sequel.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|There were many stories told of interactions that I can relate to as a veteran.  Thanks for telling the story.
B007XKEY6Q|1.0|When I try to play on kindle, I get error message claiming I have too<br />many controls for layout manager.
B005NJU8PA|5.0|I've read Tim's other books. Gave a bunch of four hour workweek books to friends who complained about their jobs and wanted more. The Four Hour Chef continues that tradition. Lots of interesting things all compiled in one large book, and some of them are about cooking. I like Tim's approach to life and the pursuit of happiness. Yes there are great cooking schools available to those who want to pursue all things food as a career. In my case I like to enjoy food and this book gives me some ideas on how I can participate without having it consume my life.
B000IZA9NK|5.0|'Sky Captain and The World of Tomorrow' would be an astounding slice of cinema if it were the usual high-profile studio production, but when you discover that it was conceived totally on a computer with the collective imagination of some overtly talented computer geeks, that makes this slice of cinema a virtual feast for the eyes.  Roger Ebert raved about it, yet was amazed that it wasn't recognized for the achievement that it was.  See this, and be transported to a world of fantasy that you'll never forget.  And, now, as this review is written, it's finally available on Blu-Ray...all the more dazzling!  Take a ride with Jude Law, Gwyneth Paltrow, Angelina Jolie ( and a Perfect English Accent by the way ) and even Michael Gambon will be there, too.  An amazing cast, and an unforgettable trip through cinema you never thought you'd see history.  Don't miss this...too many people have already.<br />  from The RoB KaCeY Phyle
1856697525|5.0|Great graphic design &#34;stuff&#34; by one of the all time masters! Got this for my daughter for Xmas-- she's a design pro.
B005LAIHZY|4.0|good movie the grandkids really love it<br /><br />kept the kids attention glued to the tv<br /><br />would recommend this movie to anyone with kids
B00063F8B2|5.0|This was just a great and fantastic item. We loved it. I love music and this was just fabulous. Great work.
B005LAIGNC|4.0|good movie lots of action and informatiom as to the past<br /><br />keeps you watching and not wandering off<br /><br />would recommend this movie
1451695195|1.0|What a disappointment! I have to question the validity of the thousand plus reviews noted on this site indicating a positive review. I bought the book with high expectations. I did not like the writers style or story. Time to shop for a new author and topic- good books are getting hard to find.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|This app is not too bad. It's forecasting is accurate most of the time though it does not tell you the wind. I do recommend this app. I hope that you enjoy.  :-)
0547391005|5.0|This was a present for a five year old boy who loves watching George on PBS and the book is lovely.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Vince Flynn can tell a tale which compells the reader to turn the page.  May the story continue.  I also enjoy the particular political undertones.
B003TSEEDY|4.0|An honest narration of a young boys life, a short and enjoyable read. I think it has a different message for each reader.
B009DH2PP4|5.0|I have bought a lot of books for brewing beer. This one is by far the best book on the market.
B001NHNG64|5.0|I will buy ALL the Jack Reacher books.  Lee Child is a wonderful writer!  I have read three so far :)
B00957T6X6|4.0|I like this book very much, although it is sometimes a bit long in descriptions - especially of wars. But a good suspens. Just finished the first part, 4 more to go... looking forward.
B003VANOFY|1.0|Stay away from this extremely buggy headset<br />Great sound when it works...<br />The product is marred with bugs. The most annoying and frequent one is the disconnect, which is heavily referenced in their forums and here in the reviews<br />It is literary a show stopper, a product killer for me<br />I have had it for 6 months now and nothing seems to fix<br />The best fix suggested in the forums is to put the base as far away from the headset as possible, which is of of course limited by the length of the cable<br />I am throwing this headset away...
B004LP3AYI|5.0|Well, I read all the books, I loved all of it, could never stop reading until finished. The story is good - even if a little depressing with all problems trying to separate the lovers, but the suspens never fails to get you through. One of my preferite books altogether.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I cried I laughed I love all three of these books Suzanne Collins should write a fifth book after I read them all I was looking at other books and none of them compared to how this book is and how all the books are you should definitely read this book after you read the other two of course if you read them out of order it just ruins the whole point.
B000JMLFLW|5.0|One of my favorite classics.  I have watched the movie, too, many times.  Such a true reflection of life and how we are as a people. So proud we miss opportunities.
B0020BUWX2|4.0|I started reading this standing in my kitchen, and here I am 2 hours later and just finished.  Couldn't put it down - nicely written and looking forward to the next book.
B00A6PD9I4|1.0|Not a very clever storyline, basically the movie Brother Bear (Disney) without the funny moose.<br /><br />Pixar junkies give me a hard time about describing it like that, but they all say the same thing: &#34;Yeah, but Pixar wasn't working on the story, they were working on HAIR in this movie!&#34;<br /><br />Well, she does have hair. Big hair. But I thought they did hair pretty well in Monsters Inc. And if you're really worried about getting good hair, don't pick a huge mass of red curls (that's going to look animated just because it's outrageously red), pick slightly curled brown hair that reacts the the moisture in the air by frizzing halfway through the day.<br /><br />Not much storywise, not a compelling plot, very predictable. Maybe good for kids? I don't know, probably a little scary. A lot of angry bears.
B0091REZMW|4.0|too soon to tell. Review requested before getting to play for even 10 minutes.  Not sure if I will continue or delete.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|And astonishing story. An inspirational a riveting story.<br /><br />Worthwhile reading this book. And don't be afraid to be sad, scared, hopeful and inspired throughout.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I am always looking forward to finishing a series, especially this one. It was a very good finish to a great series.
B009IEXKXI|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. It is fast and easy reading and is a well written unique science fiction.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I liked this second in this series. It keeps you reading to the end and wanting to get a hold of the final one.
B005HSL626|5.0|Really fun for my son and me. We take turns to see who can get better and then challenge each other :)
B000ENC5YW|1.0|I can't believe Connery used his acting ability for this film. He has done so much better in the past. Should be sold at Wal Mart in the $1.00 Bargain Bin. Don't waste the money.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is fun to make houses shacks and it is also a good way to learn to save up<br />your resources. But seriously BEST GAME EVER!!!!!!!
B00005JLSE|5.0|It has been in excess of 11 years since this movie was released. It continues to be one of the best. I will enjoy watching this DVD numerous times in the future. Don't know how anyone could rate this movie with less than 4 stars.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I loved this book. I experienced a rollercoaster of emotions and by the end I was in tears. I would definitely recommend this book.
B00AIQP9DE|3.0|The game was ok for the most part. I thought it could have been more challenging and a bit longer.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Jamie McGuire's next book from the POV of Travis much anticipated! I loved the unconditional love that they had, and this book was unlike other sappy love stories. The love of Travis and Abby was real; they fought, they made up--I could really put myself in Abby's shoes and say &#34;This would really happen.&#34;<br />I simply cannot wait for Walking Disaster.
B003Y2XI8W|3.0|It's an ok album. I bought it on a whim for that one song.  All the songs kind of sound the same to me...
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Oh my God i don't think I can wait until March for the third book! The ending is such a cliffhanger!!
B007M45PMU|4.0|I really enjoy some of the songs on this album.  Flowers in her hair and stubborn love are my favorites right now
B004EIZCPM|5.0|I really liked this movie. It's a funny throwback to the 1980's. Another plus is Emma Stone. She's awesome. Just plain great.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book will make you cry. I'm not even going to lie about that. But it is so deeply moving . The way it is written is from a unique (and hilarious) perspective. The philosophy and thoughtfulness of the characters will keep you reading until the end, even though the end is slightly predictable. BUT. this book is by no means boring and it is worth every penny. You will definitely be reminded to appreciate everything about your life and the world that you inhabit.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was AMAZING...but it annoys me so much when you just want more and the book ends in a cliffhanger
B007IXWL2C|2.0|Badly written (like the previous ones), terribly uninventive, very repetitive and totally cliché.<br />I don't recommend it at all and definitely don't expect to read anything else from E.L.James.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Just finished, now I'm going to read it again. Beautiful book. I highly recommend that everyone reads this book. My new favorite.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|All the teasing from the first book is gone. This one is overly sweet and the romance becomes even more unreal than the one between a human-virgin-teenage-girl and a vampire.<br />Super corny and as badly written as the first one.
B0055SWM08|4.0|Enjoyedq playing this game music is rather relaxing and so far game is fun. I would recomend this for its rather easiness
B00AB0AR2U|4.0|Having been an avid viewer of the series I was so excited to watch this movie. What I found was that since I was not an avid player of the game series I was going to be very lost on the character play. As a friend sat next to me explaining that new characters were not truly new, they were from the video games, I became quite lost in the story. The Resident Evil series had seemed to me one that ran independent of the video games. Now there are so many tie ins to the game series that I am not sure what is going on.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The action in this game is refined from the previous overuse of the 3D function.<br /><br />Cons:<br />The story is convoluted.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have just learned to play this card game and I have to say its fun enjoy the sudoku game as well. Helps burn up time when there is nothing to do
B0086DBE62|3.0|As I watched this movie with my girlfriend on a date night I realized that she would likely enjoy it more than I. However, I was delighted when I found it equally enjoyable. It was slightly comedic. There were moments where I had a good laugh. The story line was a unique twist in comparison to other renditions of the story. Seeing as I rented this for $3.99 it was definitely worth the money.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Brings alive so many British social history novels and history books.  Wonderful characters, costumes, and setting.  Just delightful to have the more British version.
B007SXB498|5.0|What can you say if you like Jane Austen but some people will find it banal, to say the least. Try The Modest Samaritan, similar but far more exciting.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|I haven't seen this movie in decades and purchased it for a holiday treat.  On a frozen year end day off - it was a perfect movie that made me feel so warm with all the desert scenes and it is as great as I remembered it to be.  Good extras that brought it up to date for me.
B000SEFM6K|4.0|This is Victorian Melodrama at its best. Well written without too much boring dialogue. Would recommend this book to readers who shy away from classics.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I wanted to catch up with these movies over the holidays and they are every bit as great and fast paced as I remembered.  Oh where will our connected worlds lead us?
B00138F3KU|5.0|Billy put out a few albums that fizzled when he first released them.  So he goes out and does them live.  Wow!  He brought life back into some really great songs.  Wonderful album.  This definitely deserves a place in your library.  It showcases Billy's talent on the piano, better than just about any album of his that I own.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|We love this movie, adults enjoyed it as well as our 6 yo boy and 4 yo girl. The scary parts were not too much and the story was fun with a strong message.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|When I saw the movie ads, I thought this was a fantasy but it could have really happened.  The author keeps you interested throughout and his descriptions take you there.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I read this over the holiday break and couldn't put it down.  I recently read a few other books (by different authors) floating around at the top of Amazon's SciFi list. Several of which were almost unreadable.  This one, however was a winner.<br /><br />Now I'm on to First Shift.<br />Thanks much HH, and keep it up.
B003L77G8I|5.0|Excellent, the whole family loves this show.  Excellent price, shipped in good shape and came in very quickly.  Love the Bones series.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Engaging story of change, way and struggled. Nicely covered historical moments. Great sense of class differences and the effect of social change on all classes.
B00005JLIU|5.0|Love this movie! Great price, great quality.  it shipped quickly. I have watched it twice. Brings back great memories of watching it when I was younger.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|There are bound to be fans who disagree with this reviewer's disappointment with season six as season seven got the show back on track.  There is so much Castiel (Misha Collins) that one can stand and the seventh season's introduction of the Leviathan was a breath of fresh air, especially in the casting of James Patrick Stuart as \\"Dick Roman,\\" a force to be reckoned with.  This season also saw the departure of a cast member but it was well-handled, befitting the status of the character to the Supernatural mythology.<br /><br />As always, Jensen Ackles and Jared Padelecki are their usual superb selves, still needing to be recognized by the Emmy folks. Fans of the show will have to be content that they know real talent when they see it even when the nominating folks just don't get it.  Mark Shepard's frequent appearances as Crowley are also a pleasure to watch.  The season also boasts some great guest appearances by James Marsters and Charisma Carpenter (\\"Shut Up, Dr. Phil) and \\"The X-Files\\" Nicholas Lea (\\"Time after Time\\").<br /><br />Speaking of the latter episode, one of the special features deals with the composing of the music for the landmark episode: an episode that has Dean working with Eliot Ness of \\"The Untouchables\\" fame.  This extra is quite informative about scoring and how essential it is to the overall production of  the series.<br /><br />This is an excellent season and whets the appetite for the succeeding ones, of which the series will, no doubt, continue for years to come as long as its production/writing values remain the same.
B002L6I9Z4|2.0|Honestly didn't have high expectations for this camera, but even still I the camera failed to live up to them. First, the camera is excruciatingly slow - the shutter button must be held for a solid 2.5 seconds before the camera takes a picture, and that is assuming that the flash is ready. If not, wait another 5 seconds for the flash to 'charge' up. Got this camera for my 5 year old son, and this delay is not friendly with his short attention span. As far as the picture quality goes, I wasn't expecting to frame any of these pictures, but the quality is far worse than my old 1 megapixel flip phone's camera from 6 years ago. Yes, the resolution is better, but all that means you get to see the terrible quality in finer detail. Image is washed out, no detail, lots of graininess even in sun light. Speaking of which, don't even try taking a picture in doors, the flash is completely useless. Completely washes everything out.<br /><br />So, at best this camera is only useful as a toy - and it's not a fun toy due to long shutter delay. And at $50 it's too expensive for just a plastic camera toy.<br /><br />As for the good, built in rechargeable batteries with USB charging. Very nice. At least I don't have to waste batteries on this.
B007N8RULO|2.0|the original game was easier to win. this is almost impossible! i used the 2 color type. maybe one color would be easier
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Fantastic read. Have been waiting for this installment since the first of the trilogy. Cant't wait for the last installment.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|I know that bringing a set of serial novels to conclusion is difficult in any light, but one as complex as the Pendergast saga was worthy of better.  Tying up the various loose ends was accomplished, but only by using some of the most outlandish notions, and plot contrivances.  Preston and Child can and have done better.
B009GEBBNQ|5.0|Whedon does a great job in meshing and balancing all the superstars and Avenger characters together in a melting pot that serves up a delicious treat.  All the characters are likeable, even Johansson's portrayal of Black Widow, earned a check mark in my book. Overall, the movie was great, and if your looking for action, a good story, and fun humor, then Marvel's The Avengers is for you, I just wish I had seen it on the big screen.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|i LOVED the book! i read it in a day because it was SO exciting it left me wanting more of Jace and Clary and the crazy world of Shadowhunting!
1452110581|5.0|I was given this book as a gift, and I ordered 3 more as gifts for others. It is darling and so true. I have read it several times.
0140143505|5.0|Short--read this in a day. Told in letter form. Amusing communication between American writer and British used bookseller from 1949 to 1969. I would also recommend reader watch movie by same title with Ann Bancroft and Anthony Hopkins.
B00417HV14|5.0|Amazing show and a must have for any fan!!! Joe is a master and will be considered one of the greats to ever play the guitar. This concert showcases what a true talent he is. Bonamonster!
B00AMBK6J2|3.0|Wahlberg wasn't right for this part. I don't buy him as a stoner. The script was funny and it's a cute idea.
B000W05IL4|5.0|I bought this because I have it on vinyl and I haven't had a turntable for a million years. I missed listening to this album. It was the first Anthrax album I ever purchased and I've been a fan ever since. I've seen them live more times than I can remember and they always put on a great show.  It's a great album.
B002GKXV3K|1.0|This show was never good, but this last season was pathetic. The dance contest episode was the most boring television I have ever watched.
B004PGNB1K|4.0|Patrick Rothfuss has taken a long time in publishing his second book and it clearly shows in the quality of his work and the length as well. This book was very! hard to put down. It is also one of the longest books I have read in a while. Around double and verging on triple the length of a regular triolgy based book.<br />I do however hope that the next installment does not take another 5 years to produce.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|You can put notes, search etc... love it alot. You can open documents with in the applications, all this make it alot better than the original KF application.
B00AMBLXP8|3.0|There were some funny lines but the whole story was predictable.  I knew the minute the father and his kid made their appearance what was going to happen.  I thought a lot of was came out of Ted's mouth was rude rather than funny, especially his grocery store interview.
0743270754|5.0|This is the most informative &#34;Lincoln&#34; that I have read.  It is definitely a full course in our history.  I would highly recommend it to anyone, whether you are interested in history or not.  It is a wonderful read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Very good story!!! Deep characters and well thought out plot twists. Such a sad story, but somehow you feel good about the ending because of the strong  beautifully written character of sky....
B00AAX68HG|5.0|Love this App. The graphics are great and the pudding monsters are cute. My kids love playing it and it's easy to use.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this app is fun in a morbidly fascinating way. I have played a few hours so far, and noticed something. I was looking at the cheats which you pay to unlock. I enjoyed the game very much, so I was going to buy the unlock for 3 cheats. now I was expecting 2-3 dollars price, because that is what most apps are for unlocking stuff. however, I was surprised to see it is 5.99 for the 3 cheats, and a staggering 10 dollars for the Dna sequence unlock. now I know that the developers need to make money, but this is a bit much for a dollar app. the gameplay is so flawless however, that it is still a 5 star game.
1423140605|5.0|Bought this book for my 10 year old grandson, impressed with the value of the book for price. Bought it on Amazon daily book deals. Fast speedy delivery, need to finish the collection.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Fifty Shades is everything I had heard about the book and More! Before buying the book I kept thinking to myself; What is All the hype about? We'll now I know for myself and could not put it down and found myself deep into it every chance I got! This book was suspenseful; dark but full of passion; and even funny at times! It also gave me a few ideas and I would recommend it to anyone looking to put some passion back into their marriage or relationship! ;)
B004SUWR2C|2.0|Overall the game looks great and runs great on my kindle hd but the card control is very aggravating! I will give it fivestars when they let you selct one touch card play. I have played it on my kindle fire, kindle fire hd and my mothers nook tablet. All three have the same slow and sometimes nonexisting easy release of cards and constant reopening of cards in hand. Needs improvement to be more easy to use.  fix please!!!!!!!!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Lovely game very addictive. Couldn't stop playing after the first couple of minutes, had a great experience with this one.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|We loved The West Wing when it played on television.  The dialog is intelligent and witty unlike many of today's programs. And we love the absence of commercials.
1609611543|5.0|A real eye opener  just wish i would have found this book earlier  would have made life easier thank you
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Action packed, adventure, dystopia--what most teen readers want in a novel--one of the best books for young adults!!  Hard act to follow...
B003O86FMW|5.0|The second book to the trilogy is so breathtaking. Making me hang on to every word written. This book sends mixed emotions through me. From sad to happy to a slight humour and romance. The new characters bring a little humour if you understand their traits.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Best book ever everyone should read it. It is very detailed. I can't wait for the next book! Loved it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I am so addicted. I can't stop my self!!! I also have prize claw and its also very good. You all should try it!!
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|I am a huge fan of the first 3 Alien films (yes, even the third one), and I was among those who looked forward to Prometheus, whether it was a prequel or not. I have now seen this film 4 times: first in the theater, then 3 times at home on Blu-ray. It took watching it with the director's commentary and again with the screenwriters' commentaries to appreciate the great scope of vision these guys had when making this film. Watching it the fourth time was the fulfilling experience I had hoped for in the first place.  So, shouldn't a film stand on its own?  Should a great film be \\"great\\" with only a single viewing?<br /><br />I am old enough to have seen 2001 A Space Odyssey in a first run engagement, and I can tell you that very few left the theater \\"getting it.\\" While it generated a lot of discussion, not many claimed to have loved it. I believe if we had a review system like Amazon, the film would have earned marks similar to what Prometheus is getting. I still find it difficult to sit through, but most today consider 2001 A Space Odyssey to be a classic.<br /><br />Nobody will put Prometheus in the same conversation as 2001, except to compare the character David with HAL.  Unfortunate, because Prometheus is technically as well crafted and thematically as challenging. It is possible that its detractors will view Prometheus in a few years and see it in a much more favorable light.<br /><br />Why didn't Prometheus satisfy me the way Alien did upon seeing it the first time? I admit to disappointment at the derivative plot elements in Prometheus.  Alien was so original, with surprises coming every 5 minutes. On the other hand, Alien was a science fiction horror movie--no big questions asked or answered. Prometheus, like 2001, asks the greatest question of all--how did it all begin? Prometheus does work as a prequel, in that we do learn how the alien creatures originated. To succeed as a prequel, there had to be references taking us back to Alien, though some of these were a little ham-fisted.<br /><br />I am left feeling much like I did at the end of The Empire Strikes Back, another film that good as it is, sets the viewer up for a sequel. I am hoping Ridley Scott finds the money to fund another film, one that doesn't need the alien creature at all to move forward the journey of Dr Shaw and David to find the origin of life. I am like Shaw--I will continue to believe what I believe no matter what Scott comes up with--but I think I will enjoy the discussion.
B007UXSPK2|4.0|Not a fan of Tom Cruise or the prior Mission Impossible movies. Actually rented this one because of Jeremy Renner and Simon Pegg. While I still don't care for Cruise after watching Ghost Protocol, Pegg added some lightness and humor to the script, and Renner put another good humored tough guy into the mix. Oh, and I'm a fan of the director Brad Bird, who directed Iron Giant and The Incredibles. The action sequences were breathtaking. As the star, of course Cruise is going to do most of the awesome stunts, and him crawling up the side of a building, and fighting the bad guy in a parking garage had me holding my breath. If there is another Mission Impossible movie with the same actors and director, I would watch it.
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Loved this book it was a brilliant story line and a great finish to the series. I would recommend this book. I miss the characters now
B0063GORYU|5.0|Enjoyable and entertaining. Easily downloadable.  This one of games that I play almost daily and never get tired of playing..
B0002E5O9G|5.0|I consider myself a die hard Les Misaholic- I have seen the show on stage, heard every recording multiple times, and seen both specials many times and I still say this is THE definitive production and only one you will need if you are just starting to enter to world of Les Mis.<br /><br />Colm Wilkinson: In a nutshell...this man IS Valjean. The only other 2 you will hear are Gary Morris (Complete Symphonic) and Alfie Boe (25th Anniversary). There is something magical in Colm's voice's (especially in \\"Bring Him Home\\") that the other two can't match. Gary seemed to have tried too hard to sound like a younger version of him and Alfie (while he has a wonderful voice) has the wrong voice...too operatic sounding.<br />Phillip Quast: I get goosebumps every time I hear this man sing on this recording! No one can hold a candle to his \\"Stars\\" or \\"Soliloquy\\" (aka Suicide).<br />Ruthie Henshall: While people are raving about Anne in the film or are Patti LuPone fans...I will remain loyal to Ruthie's Fantine. The emotion she admits in \\"I Dreamed A Dream\\" captures the essence of the lyrics. The song is about a women who is not quite at the bottom and you still hear that hint of optimism in her voice.<br />Alun Armstrong and Jenny Galloway: I absolutely adore their performance here as the \\"T's\\" Watching the DVD you can sense the fun they had during \\"Master Of The House\\" unlike Jenny and Matt Lucas in the 25th Anniversary. Besides, I liked Alun's \\"Dog Eats Dog\\" better.<br />Judy Kahn: I admit I was not fond of her performance here for a LONG time after, it has somehow grown on me. She sounds better than the other Cosette's (with the exception of maybe Rebecca Cain)<br />Lea Salonga and Michael Ball\\" Without a doubt....two of the top three performances of the night. I STILL tear up to \\"A Little Fall Of Rain\\" and no one can touch their \\"Empty Chairs\\" and \\"On My Own\\" respectively. I know the battle goes on as to who is better..Frances or Lea and I have to say Lea...Frances was just too annoying for me. And now for the last principle..<br />Michael Mcguire...Yes Warlow is good on the Symphonic Recording but there is one word that Mcguire has in this performance that sells it...PASSION! He has such passion in his voice you'd swear art was imitating life and he was the one wanting to take the stand and he made you want to join him.<br /><br />Again...The only version you will ever need. However if you are in a rut and need the entire score on CD...I suggest the Symphonic Recording...
B0015346OM|4.0|I have seen the movie multiple times and absolutely love it, and for that reason, finally got myself to sit down with the book. I'm glad I did, because the book adds a lot more over what the movie tells us. The book introduces quite a few characters and can be a little gnarly to follow in the beginning, but I found myself well oriented about 40-50 pages in. Bowden does a great job of making you feel you're enveloped in the utter chaos of Mogadishu, makes you feel the hopelessness, despair and (at the same time) the adrenaline rush of the soldiers.
B009KWCM6Y|1.0|The product was misleading as the CD only offers two songs.  We are returning the product for the full 1D CD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Mojang finally updated minecraft!!! It is so cool! Minecraft never glitches up, and always runs so smooth! I wish you could get pumpkins though!
B009E3EWPI|2.0|Come on, 2 cd's & 1 for the video - wasteful.<br />It would have been better if the cd's contained original music from the first 3 albums
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|AGENT PENDERGAST HAS SUPRISED ME YET AGAIN. I COULD READ ABOUT THIS MAN FOREVER.<br />PRESTON AND CHILD JUST KEEP GETTING BETTER
B005LAII3U|3.0|The movie is good.  The sound is very good.  The quality of the recording...............?<br /><br />I'd give it one more star if the quality was good.<br /><br />I returned the first one I received because it had loss of sound and/or freezing too often at around the middle of the extended version.  The new one also had the same symptoms at about the same point in the movie but they were easier to clear.  The only other disc I had trouble with on this machine was the BluRay Tarja Act One which I later learned gave trouble to almost everyone.  Is anyone else having trouble with this Total Recall BD?<br /><br />UH-OH!!  I just read my own review of Prometheus Blu-Ray. It had problems too. My 400 disc BD Sony carousel machine only has a few months of use since I bought it refurbished at a Sony outlet.  I just \\"Ethernet-ed\\" it to it's latest update.  It plays all other discs flawlessly.  Anyone notice a decline in quality of the recording media, or should I suspect my machine?
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was an excellent read, from beginning to end.  Mark Watney is a sympathetic and McGiveresque  lead character that had me rooting for him out the gate.  Though I'm technically challenged, Weir never lost me with his obvious wealth of aerospace knowledge, and realistic imagination.  Not only do I feel like I just went on a journey to Mars, I came away feeling a bit more educated and familiar with space travel.
B00APUYWYA|5.0|seriously obsessed with this film; the variety of characters, the addicting soundtrack, the great choreography, the romance. there is nothing not to love about this film. I bought in only last week and have seen it 5 times. don't let a great laugh and even better songs go by.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Be very cautious downloading this game as it is Loads of addictive fun!  It will command much of your time!
B000FA675C|5.0|Very very very good book. Really makes you think and question your surroundings. Simply amazing. Dan brown is a terrific author and I can't wait to finish the Langdon series
B0038M2AZA|5.0|There's not much I can say here that hasn't already been said, but I just had to add my voice to the chorus.  The acting is great and the story is fascinating.  Claire Danes is astounding in particular but everyone is good.  A bonus is that the real Temple Grandin joins the commentary track and as you might expect, she has plenty to say, so don't overlook it.  A fabulous job all the way around.  Everyone should see this, it should be required viewing in high school.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great book, specially considering it's only $5. I was hooked and couldn't let it go.<br />The first two stories of the sequel are already out. (First Shift - Legacy). Definitely worth picking up.
B0011N1WE8|5.0|Great family film and teaches self respect so good lesson to learn. Loved the way it was filmed with whimsy instead of full on fantisy.
B00APUU7S0|3.0|Typical CIA kidnapping, shooting, car chase, terrorist, pretty girl, etc...movie. Good story line and fairly entertaining.  Not your typical Bruce Willis movie! You'll see why....
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Saw the movie but it did not compare to the book.  The book was riveting.  I would recommend this to everyone.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This novel was outstanding. As I read this novel I found myself obsessing over  the words on the page. I would recommend this book for anyone.
B001O1O71C|5.0|A different point of view for the reader.  The holocaust through the eyes of a boy.  A must read for every age.
B002RI99HI|4.0|It is light and easy reading. I enjoyed it. It was relaxing and fun to read. I am out of thoughts.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|This is a great game!! I play it all the time!!!! I recommend it to everyone. Awesome. Very good and fun.
0758232225|5.0|This is a great writer and I couldn't put the book down when I started reading it. I read it all night
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|It works just fine as I expected for what it cost. It could be twice as long too. It's a little stiff.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|this app is a very asome app because it is about animals.And if you love and I mean love animals you will love wonder zoo.And I love animals so I loved this app amedatly so I hope you will to.
B00A9X9TIW|4.0|Pretty cool movie except I dozed off for a bit in the middle, probably just tired. But the rest kept me entertained
B0028IDXDS|5.0|I got the little blue monkey. At first I thought it was too lightweight as I used to put it on my baby's chest while lying flat on his back, but it kept on falling off. Then one day by chance my baby's face was tilted to the side and the monkey fell on one side and found out that that way it works better! Basically when baby's face is on the side while lying in bed you just put the monkey lying close to him (not parallel) putting the paci in baby's mouth, The paci stayed in his mouth and even if it came out my baby was able to pull it back in most of the times. I still would have preferred it if the hands and feet were slightly heavier.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I love Josh Groban, so I buy every CD he releases.  I wasn't disappointed with this CD.  His amazing voice gives a new interpretation to every song, old or new.
B006Y5H74W|4.0|Wonderful new show with a good story line. I like the way they use both original songs and already popular songs.
B00AHXIC50|5.0|I bought this because I liked one of his songs. I have listened to this cd many times through already and still love it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|The chemistry of the actors makes the show fantastic.  I have been a fan of the show since season 1.
B008476HBM|5.0|It is a classic and rightly so. Probably the original chick book. So much dialogue and focus on relationships between people. I thought it was very well written and certain key quotes caught my eye. Overall, a joy not a pain to read for my literature class.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I thought this book was very well written and the story line was amazing. Best book I ever read!!! Absolutely awesome
B003O86FMW|5.0|A good way to start from the first book and a great way to start the end. Can't wait to read it.
B005GVW05Q|5.0|Ryan Adams is wonderful on this mellow album. I so enjoy acoustic songwriting that is thoughtful like Neil Young's acoustic albums. I love the strings in Rocks and Kindness. Top ten records of all time includes ashes and fire. Folk is king.
1569242739|5.0|I just really enjoy cupcakes...and this book is full of recipes and photos. I like that the authors included recipes for the different frosings and they have a part where they offer up solutions to what you can do differently if your cupcake doesn't come out as you hoped. Writing this review made me want cupcakes...nice.
0788859536|5.0|One of my favorites growing up as a kid and the remastered version doesn't disappoint. Love this movie still to this day and can't wait to get my daughter hooked on all my favorite childhood movies.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I did not know what to expect when I first started this book other than the fact that I love Colleen Hoover's writing. Again I was swept away into the word's. Great read, felt everything with the characters. Excellent,  gripping novel.
0812550706|5.0|I bought his more out of nostalgia being it war the first book I read when I was a kid.  I love this book still to this day. You know it's s great book when you tell yourself only 1 more chapter and then you end up reading 5 more.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|This Bourne story was a good continuation of the story but it felt like it was missing something when I finished watching it. Perhaps I might've just wanted a mash-up of Renner's character to mesh in more with Jason Bourne's character. It followed the same kind of progressions as the previous 3 stories but nothing substantially new. Overall a good watch though.
034580404X|5.0|I bought this for my wife because she heard so much hype about it.  She was s little worried about it being too twisted or raunchy but after reading it she said people who thinks it's too dirty or weird just have a closed mind to new things.  She read the entire trilogy in 3 days.
0525953728|5.0|I loved the book. It's full of details on the general life of a seal. i didn't see anything in the book that might have breached any secrecy. I was in the military in the navy and held a top secret clearance. I spent 4 years on nuclear submarines and we engaged in a lot of espionage activity but never worked with seals. At least I don't think they were seals. On long patrol we had 25 people more than normal, mostly in civilian clothes but they didn't speak and we never knew their names. A couple of other times we carried a couple at a time but the same thing, no insignia or name stenciled on their shirts like normal. No rank but they were definitely engaged in super normal activities on a ship already on a top secret mission. I loved the details of the raid and they varied significantly from the BS story the GD government put out. I believe the author, not the government story.
B0012GVKVY|5.0|I enjoyed this movie when I first saw it. I thought it was pretty well done, if you ignore the fact that is a 90 minute Audi commercial. (though I love audi, and have owned 5 of them to date). When I put a 135&#34; screen in my basement with a Epson 6010 Pro Cinema projector, I figured I need to get a few 3D movies to have some variety for friends with they come over. Obviously, Avatar, the Avengers, Brave, How To Train Your Dragon, the Lorax and others are great as 3D films, but they were created in 3D. I believe that I, Robot was later converted to 3D, like Titanic was. They did a really nice job on this one. The 3D is very rich, and definitely adds to the film. (Titanic was also pretty well done). I recommend this for any home theater 3D collection.
B005EI86JU|4.0|Nikon can start shipping this a the official manual. One good thing is that the author has given his opinions on what he would prefer in many settings and that is very helpful as a starting point in your experimentations. Must other authors stay non committal and just give you a run down of all the options.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I installed a 3D home theater in my basement... So I guess I had to get this movie, right? I had never seen Avatar before, and really had no desire to... Just did not seem like my kind of movie. I purchased this on 3D blu ray in November of 2012, and still did not watch it for nearly a month. When I finally did, I was very surprised. I actually did like this movie, and have watched a couple more times since. I cannot imagine how they were able to film some of the scenes with existing technology, but somehow they did. Plus, the 3D is spectacular. I ahve 10 3D titles so far, including the Avengers, the Lorax, Brave, I Robot, How to Train Your Dragon, Titanic, and others, but this one is by far the best. I guess I have to agree, that if you have a 3D theater, this is a must have movie. For this I gave 5 stars... For Prometheus, I gave only 1, and that was being generous.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I like this game. It's one of my favorite games to pay when I'm bored. I would recommend this game to anyone who gets easily bored.
B0085Z8F4A|1.0|I was a fan of the alien (and predator) movies from the start, from when I first saw Alien back in 1980. But this one was kind of a let down. Some have rated it pretty high, but I feel that it was all special effects with a weak plot and weak characters. It was supposed to explain the source of the aliens, and though it did, it was confusing, and really left more questions. I ordered from Amazon Prime, got it in the mail, watched it that night, listed it the next morning, sold it in an hour, and mailed it that afternoon. Was happy to have it out of my home, and recover my money... I think I actually made $1.50, but I will never get my 2 ours back!
B004QZ9PLU|1.0|Too predictable. I used to love his books. Not so much since they all started becoming movies. This one is definitely written to be a movie. The characters are uninteresting, you just can't get into the story. Sorry Mr. Sparks. You've done much better.
B000EZ7ZXQ|5.0|I have only recently begun to purchase movies in Blu Ray, and Blu Ray 3D. This was one I wanted to have, because it is colorful, with a lot of fun music, and one that you can see over and over, yet laugh every time. I purchased this along with What Happens In Vegas and Wedding Crashers, but this is the best of the three.
B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Grandson age 21 and a Marine wanted to learn about WWll. Best history to see how the WWll was fought.
B00371QQ2U|5.0|I got this as a staple for my blu ray collection, after installing a home theater. Though it is very hollywood, to the point of being rediculas, it's still an entertaining movie with powerful music and sound. I recommend this title. However, if you like this, but are interested in a more factual version, I HIGHLY recommend the HBO series &#34;From the Earth to the Moon&#34;. It is not yet available on blu ray, but there is a newer DVD version that is wide screen, with higher bit rate, and 5.1 audio.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Also got this DVD for Marine Grandson. Anyone borne in the 50 to the 1990 should see this if not watched on HBO and later the History Channel.
B007Q0OV6Q|5.0|I love that Lego has continued to make these over the years. The kids just love them, and look forward to making a little toy each morning leading up to Christmas. Way to go, Lego!
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|I got this package for a great deal several months ago. The only reason that I got the package with 3D was because it was cheaper than just the Blu-ray/DVD combo and it had more. Still a great movie!
B005LAII08|5.0|The 3D is this movie is fantastic. Since installing a 3D home theater in our basement, I have been collecting 3D titles. This one is near the top, along with Avatar, the Avengers and the Lorax.
B005LAIHSQ|5.0|I bought this movie during Black Friday sales and got a great deal! The movie is a great. The only flaw I can find in it is Kristen Stewart's British accent.
B007OV9EYG|5.0|I had already purchased this in standard blu ray, but after we put in a 3D home theater, we just had to have this movie in 3D. Very funny, and the kids watch it often when they have friends over. They all sing along to the silly songs and laugh through the whole movie. It's the best Dr. Suess remake to date, hands down.
B004J1DBJI|5.0|I first heard about Wolfram Alpha in a magazine a few years ago and decided to check it out. It was an instant hit! Wolfram Alpha gives you the numbers that you want to know from how many people have the same name as you, or how long until your next birthday is down to the seconds. This is a great app!
B001GJOL22|5.0|I love this show. Better than R30 (older), better than Time Machine (newer), and I suspect it will stand the test of time. I saw the Clockwork Angels tour in September, and feel that the Snakes and Arrows tour, while having a weaker light show, was still a better concert overall. Lots of great extra features on this one, from additional songs, to outtakes from the filming of the backup videos. Lifeson is clearly a couple fries short of a Happy Meal... You just gotta love these guys. Who does not love Rush? People who don't understand Rush! :)
B008JGSM6G|4.0|Truly relaxing.  Fun, fun, fun.... my 7 year old plays this game and loves it.<br />Very colorful and exciting. She got me playing this game now.
B006H5120E|5.0|I recently installed a 3D home theater in my basement, and wanted to start building a 3D movie collection to have variety for when friends came over to watch. I was a bit hesitant on this one, as it was not filmed in 3D, but later converted. I was surprised at how good the 3D was. I had read from others that it was just OK, but perhaps everyone expects 3D to be like in the Avengers... It was like watching it again for the first time, and my wife and family loved it. I, Robot is another converted movie that I purchased, and it too is very well done. Beware though, as not all movies are converted to 3D with the same level of quality. I believe that the sound was also enhanced from the previous release. It seemed both more clean and spacial.
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|American Horror Story season one was a ghost story like television hadn't truly seen before. It took itself seriously and did not rush to reveal too much too soon. Season two is a bit more rushed, but no less well written.  However, if you were expecting a cookie cutter version of season one, or more on The Murder House (or Vivian and Tate's baby), you are out of luck. That story seems to have been told, at least for now.<br /><br />Asylum is set on the East Coast and revolves around the classic battle of good vs evil, God vs the Devil, while still exploring the complexity of the human condition. Without including spoilers that are not widely available already, 1964 was not known for widespread understanding of mental illness, and treatment was cruel and often fatal. Add in a masked murderer with mommy issues and you've got good television.<br /><br />My opinion? Give it a shot. It stands alone from season one, so you needn't watch that first (though you should also watch it). One piece of advice? Don't go trolling for spoilers. Let it surprise you.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|I recorded this on VHS when it originally aired on HBO. Later, I spent $120 on the 4 disc DVD set (4:3, 2.1). I was very happy to get this, which is a higher bit rate, 10:9, and 5.1 audio. Though it is missing a couple features from the previous DVD set, this one is much better, as it has chapters. I cannot rate this high enough. I am also on the mailing list for the future BluRay version, if they ever make it... It would be amazing if they could re-do it in 3D, but that probably will never happen. This was the most expensive production that HBO has ever done, and it shows. This series is absolutely amazing. It is historically accurate, while being very entertaining. Each episode is done in a unique way from the others. These episodes are factual, dramatic, emotional, funny, intriguing, and artistic. A must see for any fan of the space program, but also appeals to all others. If you don't love this series, seek help! :)
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|As a mother of preteen boys who were interested in reading the Hunger Games trilogy, I reluctantly read the first of the three books. Despite the horrifying premise, I very much enjoyed the first book - the Hunger Games. I even defended the book to other moms because  the development of Katniss's character was compelling. There were moments in Catching Fire that were more disturbing, I thought, than the events of book 1. However, this third book, Mockingjay, is very graphically violent and disturbing for a book in a trilogy that was marketed for young adults. Call me naive, but I was hoping for a little more of the triumph of the human spirit in this third and final book.
B0013FBS20|5.0|This movie is very disturbing and powerful. Will Smith is amazing in it. I have seen the movie many times on movie channels, but never purchased it until now. I have not watched it yet, but am looking forward to the &#34;controversial, alternate ending&#34;.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|One of the best books I have read about this period in America history. Being from the south I often read books set in that region and this is one of my favorites
B000JMKTLO|4.0|First book I have read by this author. It was hard to put down. Brings light to mental health issues you never think about or maybe even realize exist.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|Book one was awesome but book 2 & 3 a little boring. Would still recommend it.  Keep reading, I did
0316228532|3.0|I am more of a reader of escapist type literature, so I only picked this up to see what J.K. Rowling would write when not writing Harry.  On the plus side, the characters were fully fleshed out and you could really visualize the village and it's people.  I should have been prepared, as Miss Marple had warned that a lot goes on in a village.  Unfortunately, the only character who seems to be sympathetic is the one who creates the casual vacancy with his death.  The majority of the people in the book were unpleasant in various ways.  There was no real redemption at the end, just a hint of it.  I am someone who cries very easily, and did not find myself crying at the end.  I felt sorry for the character, but given the circumstances, the ending seemed inevitable.<br /><br />This book was full of self absorbed people, and there was very little character growth.  There was rape, cyberbullying, domestic violence, bigotry, drug abuse, child abuse, mental illness, morbid obesity and fatal illnesses. The best parts to me were the descriptions of the rowing team, and those were only told in flashback and very sparsely.  I know that sometimes there isn't a happy ending, but I had hopes for one young girl.  Unfortunately, this novel decided to maintain it's grim tone until the very bitter end.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I really liked the final installment of the Hunger Games...the only problem I had is that it lost me somewhere in the middle...overall great ending though
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|This is a good game but the screen size on a cell phone makes some grids hard to work as you cannot see the whole screen at one time.  Can be addictive.
B004J4WLPU|5.0|What sets this novel apart from the ordinary is the craftsmanship of the writing and the novelty of the approach.  I've read a lot of books, but seldom one with as unexpected (shocking?) an ending as Sister.  The entire novel is a mixture of twists and turns of plot and literary style.  Very compassionate, very literary, and very thrilling.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book was really good. It was thought provoking and it had plenty of insight on what teens are going through
6305428387|5.0|This movie is such a classic. I watched it as a kid and my wife and I still watch it. I just love it and introduce the movie to others because so many haven't even heard of the movie unfortunately.
B008XG1X18|4.0|Totally enjoying pinning on my Kindle Fire. Can slow down a bit but its bearable. System resumes quickly and then you can Pin away.
B0076DEJMO|4.0|There is so much time between the books, you lose track.  Plus these are long books!  But you remember before too long into the book.  Where do these guys get their ideas for the worlds they create?  A little long in parts, but some very interesting characters, and some very good action.  There are some surprises also.  Read all his books!
B008XG1X18|4.0|I am completely satisfied with this great app. now I just need to not be on it 27/4. the updates have helped it for the better
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Read every Pendergast novel plus most of the two writers' other books.  Many questions are answered here.  There is enough action and surprises to satisfy everyone.  This is huge in scope.  You may question why some obvious things were not done to catch the killer in New York, but you'll be satisfied overall.  Buy it for your Kendle.
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|i was very disappointed with Ted, pretty much the only good parts were the parts from the commercial, the rest of the time, i wasn't impressed at all
B0094K1QR8|1.0|Whoah - what a dumb movie.  I think I must've killed a few cells on it, too.  I want the 20 minutes of my life back that I wasted before I couldn't take any more.  Luckily, I had some good ice cream and coffee while watching it, when that ran out, I just couldn't take it any longer.  Don't waste your time.  Luckily, Amazon appears to have a few better choices for the next time I'm looking for something new to watch.  Yes, this review is even dumb and boring - and for a good reason too.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|it was a great movie, action packed and thought provoking at the same time, i know this was a remake, but it was different, which made it stand out
B00A2BTCXI|1.0|I have read the reviews and some of the comments. I do have the blue ray HD/DVD audio version like most. I chose to play the DTSHD surround twice now and it only sounds like stereo.  Yes, I do have a Sony blue ray player and Rush's \\"Moving Pictures\\" HD sounds great in DTSHD surround! I should not have to play it in DVD audio, should I?  I will gladly delete my review and make a 5 star one if someone can tell me what I' m doing here.

B007TBZ63Y|5.0|The book was by no meanss  last down to the previous two book. It kept you on the edge of your seat and wanting to read more. Best book of the series
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I loved Kitchen House, it was hard to put down once I got started! The story is set in the early 1800's & gives you an idea of what slavery was like in the South from the slaves point of view.
B008IYR2BA|5.0|I keep expecting each new season to be not as good as the last, but have yet to be disappointed. Fabulous -- if serial killers are your thing.
B004LWZWGK|5.0|This movie is fantastic.  It is the best of the three movies:<br /><br />1.  Quality story telling<br />2.  Another fantastic villain<br />3.  Neatly ties up the three story arc<br /><br />Even though the story is neatly tied up at the end, it does leave the possibility open for someone else to pick up the story.  The characters are excellent.  Catwoman is phenomenal.  Overall, a movie you will not regret purchasing.<br /><br />The video quality is also outstanding especially in the IMAX scenes that fill up the entire screen.  It is not annoying at all, but would love to see the entire movie filmed with IMAX camera so it fills up my screen at home.

B0048KXRR6|5.0|This may not be some big Hollywood production and, yes, it is sort of a knock off of Mary Poppins... but my family loves it and that's what matters! Good for kids and adults who don't want the language and sex and violence of many movies today.

B009YP9L7U|5.0|The story was great! The couple was so cute together. Too bad we all can't find a love so easily in Vegas,
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After all of the hype surrounding this series I was hesitant to read these books. Boy was I surprised at how fast I fell in love with these characters! After reading all three books in the series in less than two weeks I must say it has been a wild and enjoyable ride. Although this is a book written for teens it really touches on some very serious subject matters such as cruelty and politics, young love and tough choices. A great read.
B0076DELIG|5.0|I love Michael Connelly books, and this was a great story covering several time periods and weaving a story through a war, riots, and into present day. Very satisfying read. Love Harry Bosch!
B004SKJTY6|5.0|Amazing film. We really enjoyed the movie. A great story of accomplishment and heartfelt moments. Not to mention a great teacher.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I found the book very facinating  and interesting.  I have always loved American History and have read alot about<br />Lincoln.  I didn't know much about the men in his cabinet.  I thought the book was very well  written and very interesting.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I think it's fun!  The only problem is can you draw?  I received a very insulting message from one person who said I 'sucked' at drawing,  Well, don't agree with him but that wasn't a requirement anyway!  I try not to be too complicated in my drawing ~ it's easier to make it simple and to the point and to select one out of a choice of three in degrees of difficulty or select a whole new list to choose from.  What's easier than that?
B000EWD1KK|5.0|I have always loved Danny Kaye.  I grew up watching him.  I found this movie very funny and is typical of Danny Kaye's<br />acting and singing.
B00AMBH70S|2.0|It ended.  That's it.  But it couldn't be over, could it??  I sat staring at the screen, seeing that there were only a few minutes left, and I thought, \\"Please let something MAJOR happen now\\".  And it didn't.<br /><br />Jeremy Renner is perfect for this role. He's believable, maybe even more so that Damon.  I loved watching HIM. I didn't like the story line (if there was one).  I hope Jeremy continues this role, but I hope that everyone else associated with making this movie are asked to step aside.<br /><br />I can't believe it ended the way it did. How did this movie get approved for release??  Didn't ANYONE view it before sending it out to the theaters?  So sad that such great potential was crumpled up and thrown away, leaving a very talented actor to sit around and look foolish for picking this role.

B000YMM3CC|5.0|My mother and sister had been trying to get me to watch this movie for years and I was never really intrested. I have to say it has to be one of the best movies I have ver seen. Totally worth watching.

B007FEFLTO|5.0|The second book was as riveting as the first. I hope the third book comes out soon, I need to see how it ends.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed reading The Martian. It is science fiction, but the only fictional part is that we have not yet travelled to Mars. The rest is a very realistic and engaging story. I was doubting between 4 and 5 stars. Four is not enough because this book is superb. Five is just a tad too much because at times this book went into a bit too much technical detail. But on the whole it's a great read and Amazon does not allow me to select 4.5 stars so there you go, five stars!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book... I couldn't put it down. A wonderful read. I didn't  want it to end! Hopes there will be another book soon!

B003G4W49C|5.0|This is an absolutely amazing book. I read it because it was recommended to me and I didn't even read the description, totally worth a read. The characters are very believable, even if it is based in the future. I will definitely be reading this one again.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Wasn't expecting much from a free book but this one was a fun read. Definitely recommend it =D Hmmm, 2 more words required for the review so this should do.

B004DM0UII|5.0|Offerred as a free app and being in the southern US love the ability to get stations in Europe that play the techno dance music I love. But from local to anywhere in the world you can connect. And great features to customize and even use as a sleep timer. One of the best apps I've found.
B008MWBY6W|4.0|Just received the Amazon Basics Holster camera bag, and I am officially in love.  I'm a small (input, very tiny, 5'2 on a good day) person, and hate having to lug around huge camera bags that seem to take over my body.  But this bag is small enough to easily carry around, while yet big enough to stow everything I need for a small photo shoot or just a breezy snap happy day.<br /><br />For a rundown: the outer area of the case has one small zippered area on the front of it that also houses two small Velcro pockets that are just big enough for SD cards on one side.  On the other side of this zippered area is a little mesh pocket that can easily be used for cleaning cloths, more SD cards, etc.  Each side of the case also comes equipped with zippered areas that allow for more storage of small items.  The top of the case has a padded handle, and the strap has a movable padded shoulder area that is very comfortable.  Not to mention I can easily put the strap on my shoulder or toss it sling style for hands free movement. The bottom of the camera bag is encased in a hard plastic, which is great when setting down your bag on a hard floor/ground plus it's so solid I have no fear about moisture getting in.  Now the inside of the case is lined with a soft microfiber material, and is roughly 8 inches long, and 6 and a half inches wide, but keep in mind this is a holster bag and it tapers down in width.  There are two movable Velcro strips that nestle your camera and hold it up in its down position.  What I also love above this case is it is very padded, so I'm not worried about any accidental bumps harming my camera.  As a side note, the thick padding at the bottom of the case is removable...not that you'd want to do that unless you're switching it out for another padded bottom.<br /><br />Now for the part I was fearful of.  Could this small holster fit my Canon 60D with its 18-135mm lens with the filter attached?  The verdict...it totally can! There isn't room for anything else in the case after I managed to stuff my camera strap alongside the lens, but it did fit fine, and I'm not worried that my camera will be damaged in any way.  This case is definitely perfect for those who just want to bring their camera along without lugging a mess of equipment, and it can work for just about everybody!in the case after I managed to stuff my camera strap alongside the lens, but it did fit fine, and I'm not worried that my camera will be damaged in any way.

B000MR9D5E|5.0|Since I am a fan of everything ever done by Sir David Attenborough I can only rave about this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This was a fantastic book that would appeal to both male and female audiences. Great action, several surprises, tragic endings, and a struggle for love. Plus, the writing style of the author was perfect for younger and older audiences alike.
B00007E7K0|5.0|It is just what I needed and arrived in a timely fashion and the cost was very reasonable.  What more do you need?
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The book was excellent. I could read it over and over again. The book was a lot like the movie which I like.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|A story that will propel the reader to continue, even when events are difficult to bear.  It ultimately leads to the triumph of love and sacrifice; a story of family, no matter what the color of skin.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Mockingjay by Suzanne Collins. I've read all the books now and give reviews about them that u couldn't possibly think existed in my vocabulary but this time I just want to say it's a great book thanks :)
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Love it!  Easy to use and read!  I was very impressed with this calculator!  AAAAAAA+++++++  Very glad I ordered it!
B000FA5TTW|5.0|i already saw the movie but never read the book so i decided to go for it. and from the very beginning i knew it would be great . you just end up zipping through it. i cant wait till i get the movie from the library i plan on like reading and whatching it in clips and compareing the two. cant wait. it really touches your  heart if only there was a little more suspense. like you didn't know who the killer was eighter but even so it is still a good read.
B008220D5K|3.0|While this movie says it's about being 40, what it is really about is a modern family with all the struggles and difficulties of being a parent today. There is so much here that I found true to life that I was actually uncomfortable at times because of how on target it was. The teen daughter's plotlines are particularly spot on. The younger daughter steals every scene she's in. Their relationship is perfect. The parents' lack of personal time, the way they exist in the same space but aren't connecting, and the way they interact with their children are fascinating insights into today's parenting. All of this rings true and there were numerous laugh out loud moments for both myself and my wife as we watched this.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the director/writer isn't satisfied with simply poking fun at the family he has to do so with an overabundance of foul language and inappropriate situations. One reviewer said that there was no subtlety here and they were correct. There is nothing insinuated, which is a great way to tell a story; leaving it up to us to draw the conclusions and connect the jokes. Instead it's all in your face and so obvious that it's no longer funny, but mostly uncomfortable. If the movie started out hilariously, it hits this midway point where very little fun (or laughter) happens and that section lasts all the way to the end.<br /><br />This is an insightful writer who instead of sharing those insights with humor decided to throw the insights and all the terrible in-poor-taste jokes in our faces for so long it just got old. I can't positively recommend any part of movie other than the first 30 minutes and even that I have to say it isn't for those who prefer not to hear every kind of terrible curse word (out of even young childrens' mouths!) and other sundry references.<br /><br />This is not 40. This is mediocre, trashy humor that completely ruins the truth that should have been the focus.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|great game to play to relax and get upset at the same time.spend way to much time trying to better my previous time and stars
B00A81MV3U|4.0|This is a hilarious romantic comedy turned drama! The acting is great, the set up for the story is fascinating and laugh out loud funny at times. But it isn't without its problems.<br /><br />Pat and Tiffany both have mental disorders that are played as humorous, but if we actually stop to think about the message this movie is sending this seems in poor taste. There are times where the disorders are thoughtfully depicted and the consequences clearly on display, and when this happens this movie shines. How Bradley Cooper plays Pat is one of the best performances of the year in any genre. He is completely convincing. Jennifer Lawrence's Tiffany is less so. We do find out why she is so caught up with sex, but the answers fell flat for me. She came off as less someone to feel sorry for and more someone to avoid. I think it's more the writing than the acting here, because later in the film, when it takes the easy way out for the finale, she all the sudden has interests and information that her character shouldn't have if she were really as lost as Pat.<br /><br />One other thing: this movie is so vulgar at times that it shocked me out of my enjoyment of the film. Many of the newer films that are supposed to be romantic [something, be it drama, comedy, whatever] are so vulgar now that it makes date night less fun and romantic and more cringe worthy and uncomfortable for those of us who don't toss out the F-Bomb every few words. (SLIGHT SPOILER: For instance, the very first night they meet, Pat is walking Tiffany home - how that happens is brilliant - but then says to him out of nowhere, \\"You can come in and F me if you want to if you turn out the lights\\" (because she hates his Jets jersey.) Why?! The scene was hilarious and romantic and Tiffany was intriguing and funy ... and then ruined.<br /><br />This is a very interesting, funny film that takes a few wrong turns.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was absolutely phenomenal! I read it in one sitting, finishing at 4 am and due to the subject matter and the way Hoover skillfully weaves the plot, I was still thinking about these characters and this book for the next 48 hours.  It's hard to talk plot, so let's talk characters.  This is a YA novel with extremely snappy dialogue and two awesome main characters in Holder and Sky.  The chemistry between these two is sizzling and realistic.  Their past's define their outlooks and there is A LOT of emotional baggage that each needs to overcome.  This is going to be a thin review because I can't gush away without giving something away.  All I can say is if you like YA, if you like to experience intense emotions while reading, if you love when two people find their way together THEN YOU MUST GET THIS BOOK! :)  But let me warn you, start reading on a Friday night when you have Sat/Sun free because you are going to need time to recover from the sleep you lose while reading this in one sitting!!  Thank you Colleen Hoover for this fantastic book! It's my first review of 2013 and my first A+ review in a LONG time! :) [...]

B009B4ZEKM|1.0|Unlike the washed masses, I truly liked Bionic a great deal; I'd give it at least 4 stars. It was the most creative, and varied, album she's done, by far. But it didn't have mass appeal and didn't sell (at least not to her megastar standards). So here she plays it safe, going back to the formulas that have worked for her in the past, and turned out...a listenable, not-half-bad album. But that's all it is, and that's a disappointment. She has one of the great voices of her generation and is capable of so much more. If you're a fan, you already own it. Otherwise, don't bother.

B0009MAP9A|5.0|What can I say? Dylan at the peak of his pre-electric, folk protest period, writing intelligent and socially challenging lyrics that hold up almost 50 years later as well as they did in 1964. Not one of his top five albums, maybe not one of his top ten, but with the body of work he's created over five decades, that's no criticism. With God on Our Side is right up there with Masters of War and The Times They Are A'Changing with Blowin' in the Wind. One Too Many Mornings is a small masterpiece, and Boots of Spanish Leather and Restless Farewell penetrating, compelling works. (For the record, and in no particular order, my top Dylan albums are Blonde on Blonde, Blood on the Tracks, Highway 61 Revisited, Bringing It All Back Home, and John Wesley Harding. No, wait, make that Planet Waves. Er, I mean, Desire. OK, the top ten....)

B000051VWW|5.0|But then that's what she does, and does so well. Sade only releases an album when she is moved to, not according to any timeline. And yes, this is an older CD now, but I only just bought it a few months back. I don't know how I let it slip by at the time, but when I picked up Solider of Love--which is magnificent--I just had to have more, and that's when I noticed that I had let this gem slip by years ago. Beautiful.
B001OGWY1W|4.0|The Dark Knight was a great installment in the new Batman series starring Christian Bale.  My household owns a copy of Batman Begins, and had gotten The Dark Knight Rises on disc through another service.  I wanted to watch the entire series on New Year's Eve 2012, so I came over to Amazon.  The Instant Video on Amazon played just fine with no glitches and is an easy way to view something quickly.  You are able to pause the movie during play, and even altogether stop and come back later.  This was my first use of the Amazon Instant Video service.<br /><br />The Dark Knight has been described quite well by many reviewers over the past several years so I will not elaborate on plot, etc.<br /><br />It was a great na-na-na-na-na-na New Year's!
B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought all three of these for $30, and all the special features are included. Individually buying all of them would've been close to $50, which was a major deterrent, but I saw this and snatched it up as soon as I could.<br /><br />Picture quality was great, got to me in two days, can't say I have any complaints at all.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I loved this book!  It will pull at your heart.  You can't help but love Sky and Holder and the strength they pull from each other.  This author is becoming a favorite of mine.

B001GXTXTO|5.0|Sludgey, low down, gritty, bluesy, low fi, fuzzy, nasty riff driven rock.  Every album should be recorded like this.  You are in the center of the garage with them.  Lousy amps, cheap guitars, basic drum kit and from top to bottom these guys KILL it.  Not a lame tune in the bunch. Thick freak out!!!  Two more fingers of grease please!
0545128285|5.0|I wish people would remember that Harry Potter, no matter how much the movies can seem otherwise, is a book for children. If you go to the library or book store, they will be in the children's section. So if you're older and wanting to read this, please remember that. Plus, in the Harry Potter books, these were tales for young wizard children.<br /><br />With that being said, I still love it and think its adorable. I will definitely read this to my younger brother. He loves Harry Potter, magic, and he'll learn a lesson from them.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Amazing graphics and a lot of great puzzles. Alot of fun and I can't wait to play the sequel!  Got stuck at a couple of places, mostly due to not hitting the object in the correct spot, but the forums are a great help to get out of a stuck scene.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I'm an avid reader and having a Kindle fuels that passion. Despite the number of books I read every year, I still don't find too many that keep me up late or have me grabbing my Kindle every chance I get to keep moving through the story. The Wool series did, though, and I'm thrilled I found this omnibus edition so I could just keep reading the next great chapter day after day.<br /><br />I found the writing to be very well done with an easy flow but with enough depth that you get drawn in by the characters. The storyline is intriguing enough, which is what caught my eye in the first place. But the author reels the reader in and doesn't let you off the hook. It was a pleasure to read a post-apocalyptic novel that wasn't centered on zombies and the inhumanity of man. In fact, it's the characters' humanity in facing an inhumane world that helps the reader relate to the story that much more.<br /><br />I will definitely be looking for more Wool books and keeping the author in mind when seeking other books to feed my reading habit.

B003NWS5AO|5.0|This is more quality music from Robert Plant. It is sort of blues/bluegrass/rock.  It is as good, if not better, but different than his Raising Sand. I especially love his Satan Your Kingdom Must Come Down (Theme music from the TV series, The Boss)  I have become a real fan.

B007J4T2G8|4.0|I love the story line....I love the writing.... I think the author has a Very vivid imagination as you get a very descriptive outline of each scene and its more than just the sex scenes. There is a story unfolding and its wonderful....cant wait to read book 2...
B00511QI4A|4.0|In this novel of intrigue and science, Baldacci suggests a world where the bad guys develop technology that turns the entire world's security on its head. By inventing a technique that renders security screening obsolete, a frightening new world could be ushered into being. Unless of course Oliver Stone and his club of misfit friends, with the welcome addition of an MI 6 operative can stop it. Well constructed, and within the bounds of possibility, this makes for a good read indeed!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book is more than porn. Listen people have left reviews stating that the writing is child like and that every page is a detailed description of Christian and Ana having sex. I believe its more than that. Yes its a love story but it also has a very good story line. People should not be so quick to assume based on other people's opinion.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This one makes you think, without being irritating. The music and sounds are gentle--not obnoxious. I highly recommend this one.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I have to say I am totally surprised of how i am engrossed with this book and its characters. Peeta is growing on me and the story line is just great. can't wait to see how its translated on the big screen and i can't wait to start book 3...)
1451638450|4.0|I've always liked Ivan; I never thought he was an idiot. He's just not a hyper-competitive, hyper-aggressive, palace intrigue plotting genius. So, by comparison to everyone else on the Barrayaran scene he seems a little slow. In this book, we learn that a little slow can be good for you, in the end.<br /><br />This book continues Lois' trend, as seen in the last three or so Vorkosigan novels, to play-up the romance and downplay the action. I'm a sappy guy, so I'm mostly good with the romance; Tej is certainly a sweet character and a great romantic interest for Ivan. Her quirky family adds comedic elements and Galactic hooks that make the story more complex. I do, though, wish there was a bit more action in this and the last few Vorkosigan books--thus the four stars.<br /><br />Otherwise, it was great (and warm and comfy) to be back in the Vorkosiverse, with some of our favorite people--Lady Alys, Simon, Emperor Gregor, Duv, Byerly, etc. We only encounter Miles and Ekaterin during one scene, but that really is quite enough; this is Ivan's story. I enjoyed seeing Ivan handle, in his own laid-back way, the problems, and unexpected delights, he encountered as the story unfolded.<br /><br />If Lois is inclined to write more stories in this universe from the POV of characters other than Miles and his immediate family, that would be fine with me. An empire with three planets and agents and embassies spread among tens of other worlds gives a lot possibilities.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Very good book!  I laughed and I cried,did not want to put this one down!  I highly recommend this book.
B0060ZJ7BC|2.0|I love good baseball movies. I loved Cobb with TLJ, I loved \\"The Babe\\" with John Goodman...and I adored Costner in \\"For the love of the game.\\" This movie was nothing like them. Bradd Pitt plays a rather unfeeling human being who lives ,eats and breathes doing recruiting his way, regardless of whose feet get stepped on. He has the same schemer-con man personna that Tom Cruise had in Jerry Mucguire. No6t a likeable character in any way. His brainiac asst. was as boring as......well, most nerds who specialize in stats would figure to be. There was no zenith, no climax no \\"feel good\\" moment in this picture, and why was this movie so long? It felt like it was over 3 hrs to me. They say here its 233 minutes. Rhats 43 min too long. This film needed some editing very badly. Did they pay Bradd so much that they felt they had to get over 2 hrs from him for no other reason. The only thing I liked is that as a Forex trader, i liked how he showed that stats will beat feelings and intuition, every time.<br /><br />The problem with this model, is that we would never follow our heart in making decisions. But either way, this was not really a role for Brad Pitt. It didnt fit him at all. Let me just say this, I took my girlfriend to this movie. The first movie we ever went to together. And when we left, she said nothing until we got in the car. That is not a good sign. Definitely not a womans picture! See it with the \\"guys\\" not with other couples. Bad acting, bad script, just too underwhelming for me. I would trade this whole movie for Kevin Costners movie where he is  saying \\"God, I know you are busy, but if you would just make my shoulder stop hurting for 10 minutes I would really appreciate it.\\" That's a movie. And thats an actor perfectly fitted for it!

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This is the must read book. I love Sky and Holder, Holder was amazing, I loved their journey together the way that their love helped them through both of their struggles.<br />It was sad  and heartfelt. This book had it all. I just hope there will be a movie.<br />Their first kiss, that wasn't a kiss, amazing to read, loved how funny they both were. Colleen  Hoover is my new favorite author, great writing.
B00664AM5C|3.0|I recently purchased Contagion from an electronics store.  However upon returing home I noticed movie runtime is 106 mins.  Amazon's listed runtime is 186 mins.  Both versions are listed as PG-13.  I've searched online for any information and found no results.  Can anyone help with this discrepency?
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was a bit scarey, how two people can be so in love and then turn on each other so dramatically.  The wife was a bit over-the-top in her assessment of things, but her husband should have realized who she really was after a couple of years.  This kept me wondering what would happen and how trapped a person can be in a relationship with deceite as it's basis.

1439152802|3.0|I love love love Kate Morton books and I could not wait to get into this one.  I am half way through it and it has been a struggle.  It drags and I have to make myself keep going.  She writes so well and the concept of the story is interesting but somehow it just doesn't hold my interest.  The Distant Hours and The House at Riverton and The Forgotten Garden were on my list of favorite reads over the last few years so I am wondering if this book is a reflection of my mood and mindset at the moment.  I will finish it because I never dismiss a book when it is only half done but will give it to a friend to see her reaction.  I hope I love the second half and will come back to report.
B006VFLIYK|5.0|When I got the Kindle as a gift I also got a gift card with Amazon.  This was the first book I purchased and the book and the Kindle experience was great.  Baldacci has become a staple read for me and Amazon's service for the Kindle is extraordinary.
B00511ONPG|5.0|This book is clearly one of my favourites. Dave writes in a style that is easily understood and as if he is talking directly to me. The case studies are real, believable and relevant. At the end of each chapter Dave suggests steps for your to practise your new learning. I really enjoyed this book, and can't wait for Likeable Business to arrive in my letterbox. I know it will be just as good, and I'll probably read both more than once!
B004DM0UII|5.0|When reading on the Kindle Fire, I like listening to music. A lot of times classical music works best. Iheartradio only has two stations. This app offers entire stations that specialize in classical guitar or Baroque or whatever. I got it for free and don't have to give any info out. Awesome!

B000MHV2V2|4.0|Many Lennon fans have labeled this record a \\"masterpiece\\", and indeed it may well have been, if not for the existence of his debut album from the previous year (read my other review), in which, though there are no hit singles as appealing as \\"Imagine\\", they are more painfully truthful in their rawness, than the Phil Spector castrato orchestrated violins of this album. Granted, many of the songs are appealing, but whereas the overall theme in the first album was the revelation and confession of pain, this one is all over the place about wishful thinking of \\"peace\\", among \\"swearing eternal loyalty to yoko\\" (\\"Oh Yoko\\" was a waste of a good song, in my opinion), a vicious response to a misperception of a \\"dissin\\" from Paul McCartney, anti-war statements. And though I OWN this album in its original UK vinyl and Japanese CD reissue, and I like the melodies, I don;t believe the words in it for a second. I think of it the way I feel about New Order lyrics: made up to fit the melodies, but nonsense overall. For the man who preached \\"peace\\", was the same one who betrayed his first wife, abandoned his first born son, and in an interview, mentioned that he was born of a whisky bottle, shacked up with a talentless gold digger who most likely used the services of a Santeria witch and Spanish Fly, to rein him in for his millions, like the venerated Steve Jobs before him - tried as much as possible to reduce alimony payments to his first wife, while the Asian amoral concubine bought herself luxuries the first wife was denied , drank to excess and exposed his manhood by beating up women (anyone remember May Pang?), and essentially wrote 3 and 4 chord songs that were simple enough to be likable - and in those days, well marketed enough to sell by the millions. In short, I like this album, but as a person, he was no better than a Television preacher who lives in luxury while preaching poverty. His murder in 1980 unfortunately only perpetuated The Myth that Lennon was a Man Of Peace like Ghandi. I have had Indian professors dismiss the myth of Ghandi, but in the USA, we prefer to create larger than life heroes out of clay, while ignoring and dismissing in disdain, the common everyday Joes and Janes who make more lasting and relevant contributions. Not sexy enough.
B009E3EYS8|5.0|they did a great recreating the old songs jason bonnom was great the dvd was great loved seeing the band play
B007IE4DSG|4.0|The album clocks at little over 30 minutes, and the tracks are mostly well remixed demos. Still, it is nice to hear George surrounded by clear instruments. The ridiculous \\"wall of sound\\" is nowhere here, and that is a big plus. I'd like to see if there will be a Volume 2 with more songs from \\"All Things Must Pass\\". In fact, I would love to someday hear ATMP stripped of the stupid Phil Spector overdubs the same way they did with \\"let It Be.. Naked\\". At that point, ATMP would sound as if it was recorded only yesterday.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|It was too short and the book doesn't have a solid story line. Now I am just filling up words.
B007KAJG3K|1.0|If you're maybe 12 years old and like video games then this may have cinematography you would like.  Like watching a movie with a strobe light.  Holmes is an erudite British detective, not a comic-book super-hero who always has a 3-day growth of beard.  A terrible waste of some otherwise decent costumes and sets. They basically took a cheezy Kung Fu action movie, changed the name of the character to Holmes and set it in turn-of-the-century England.  Take away the scenery and make Sylvester Stallone the lead and you have a low-budget shoot-em-up action movie.  Zero stars.  And, subtract a few more stars for the total disrespect of a classic character.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This book is a must read ,it's funny,sad,and inspiring all in one good book. I recommend this book to everyone!

B008YWY0HK|5.0|I got this for my kids  for Christmas, tis is one of the funniest movies I've seen in a while. Disney made another great movie.<br />I can watch it over and over.
B008602KQI|4.0|Anytime you try to adapt a book into a movie, there is bound to be disappointment.  I miss some of the subtle nuances and differing explanations from the book, but this movie captures the heart of it very well.  Jennifer Lawrence is an excellent Katniss Everdeen and her acting blew me away.  You could feel her fear, pride, and see her thinking as Katniss.  The girl who plays Rue is charming and breaks your heart. Elizabeth Banks is unreconizable and brilliant, and Woody Harrelson as Haymitch is simply fantastic.<br /><br />That said, one complaint about the movie is many of the actions scenes were filmed in that current, annoying Hollywood phase of shaky cam that directors seem to think makes it more realistic but basically just makes me woozy and unable to see the action.  When I watch action movies I want to witness the action not get seasick.  I think that this may have been done to show Katniss' disorientation as well as to provide some cushion to scenes of children killing children, but I found it disappointing and stupid, as I do in every movie that uses it.  I go to  movie to see the movie, not to be impressed that the director is so clever he can prevent me seeing the movie with crappy camera-work that is deemed &#34;artistic&#34;.  Luckily, most of the movie does not employ this ridiculous effect, but it used it enough that instead of being a 5 star adaptation, it is merely 4 stars.<br /><br />Other good points are how well they brought the characters to life and the scenes to life.  Especially vivid is the distinction between the squalor and depression of District 12 and the vivid opulence of the capital.  I love how they depicted the costuming, and most of the movie - the parts that were not shaky came - happened to be visually stunning.  I also enjoyed the use of the commentators of the games to explain various aspects of games - this exposition was entertaining and fun.  In the novel, so much is explained through Katniss' point of view, but the use of the commentators to explain about the environment and mutated species was a brilliant move.<br /><br />The only other aspect that was unenjoyable was the conversations between President Snow and Seneca Crane.  These scenes added nothing to the movie, did not appear in the book, and were quite annoying in general.  Even my husband, who hadn't read the novels, questioned why these scenes were in the movie at all and felt that they detracted from it.  All we could come up with was that Donald Sutherland probably wouldn't bother doing a cameo in this movie even though his role in the later movies would be expanded, but that is merely speculation.  These scenes also took away from the movie overall - in the time they spent on these scenes they could have kept in more scenes from the book that actually happened.<br /><br />Negative aspects aside, this is a movie I will watch over and over again and that I am happy to own.he commentators to explain about the environment and mutated species was a brilliant move.<br /><br />The only other aspect that was unenjoyable was the conversations between President Snow and Seneca Crane.

B007IXWKUK|2.0|Seriously?!! This woman's inability to write well left me hating the first book in the trilogy, I'm actually quite surprised I even dared to read this one but what little story plot there was had me wondering where she would take the characters..this book was some what better than the first, but still didn't live up to the hype these books received.. I also don't see what there is to rave about the sex scenes.. nothing overt the top in my opinion, are people's sex lives really so boring to get so excited over what's in these books?! Sad.. but on a brighter not I also went on to read the third, and actually enjoyed it, not as much sex (which in my opinion was great because she continuously recycled scenarios it seemed) the story was good, and it seemed that she learned how to write better over the course of writing the two previous books
1594745692|2.0|I have another tarot set from the same people called &#34;The Housewife's Tarot&#34; and it is hilarious, fun, and easy to read with.  I had high hopes for the Zombie tarot, and while it contains the same 50's kitchy imagery, it fails to be a deck I could use for a reading as it seems the point of view changes from human to zombies depending on the card or suit.  With a deck like this the card meanings can be totally different depending on if you are rooting for the zombies or for the humans.  They really needed to pick one point of view and go with it.<br /><br />As someone who knows the tarot very well, I could tell right off the bat the depending on the point of view the card meaning changed.  When some of the cards are from the point of view of the zombies and some are from the point of view of the humans, it becomes seriously annoying to try to read with this deck.<br /><br />This is a good deck for tarot collectors or zombie lovers, but not a good reading deck.  After looking through it a couple of times to see the artwork, it is now collecting dust on my shelf.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|This excellent literary novel is written from the first person point of view of a dog who believes he will be reincarnated as a human. Yes, I know it sounds a bit odd at first blush, but you get into it as you read. It's a poignant story of the struggles, both of the dog and his \\"owner,\\" a race car driver. The man has the skills, but circumstances hold him back. The dog would give just about anything for an opposable thumb...or a tongue that would let him vocalize. Stein has something to say about the existential condition of sentient beings, man or dog. A great read.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I was skeptical to read this book given the name and only downloaded it due to good reviews and a reasonable price. This became my favorite book of the summer. It was awesome. Colleen Hoover is now one of my favorite authors of all time.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|My sons doodle all the time, so this was fun for them.  It's a great puzzle game with the added fun of creating your own character.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The only reason I'm giving this three stars is due to my enjoyment of all of Preston/Child's previous books. Having said that, and to echo many other reviews, this may be my last P/C book for a long time. One can't help but feel this last one was cranked out for the sole reason that they had a contract to fulfill.  They and the publishers milked three books out of what should have been a tightly edited two volume set.<br /><br />An editorial pet peeve of mine is the repeated use of words which occur numerous times in consecutive paragraphs of the same chapter. This occurred many times in the first third of the book, most notably with the word \\"inarticulate(d)\\". It also felt like the pages of each chapter were collected off the floor and assembled in random order. At one point, Constance used a colloquialism that someone from the late 1880's would never say.<br /><br />The incorporation of two completely separate and unnecessary subplots was confusing at best and irrelevant to the story.  Please make the irritating and annoying Corrie Swanson go away. And now that Dr. Feldman has \\"solved\\" the Constance Greene mystery, I hope his character will not appear in any future books.  The contrived plot to spring Constance from the asylum was laughable.<br /><br />One only has to go back to the beginning with \\"Relic\\" and work your way through the first books to see how far P/C have fallen.  Perhaps AXLP's extended vacation will allow this franchise to fade away.  Alas, I have a feeling that he will stumble across more trouble somewhere in the future and that's too bad.

B009NH6AOQ|5.0|I started watching season 2 because i missed season one, and i got hooked instantly!<br /><br />This series has the best characters of any TV show ever made!!!! Perfect plot, and sometimes, if you get attached to the characters (Like i did) you don't even realize it is a zombie show. If a character dies, you cry sometimes.<br /><br />But back to season 3... I had dish and they decided to cut out AMC on it before the 3rd season started! So i watched the first episode on demand. Then we switched to mediacom just because i wanted to watch the whole series!!!<br /><br />Season 3 has better graphics, and so much action than the first and second season! And you could tell how the characters changed from the 1st and 2nd. And in this season... there are new survivors that will get you hooked right away!<br /><br />I got my friends hooked on this series (Besides one) And they all are obsessed with it!!<br /><br />Anyway, i TOTALLY  perfer this series to everyone. But watch the first season first, or you WILL become confused! I hope this show goes on and on!

To underrated...
B004DM0UII|4.0|For what it's worth, this is a pretty awesome radio app. There are over 50,000 radio stations of multiple genres to surf through, and I think that number will only grow. I actually hope it does, for like [[ASIN:B004XDYJRU TuneIn Radio Pro]] there are a lot of local stations that I do not have access to, so for the moment [[ASIN:B005ZFOOE8 iHeartRadio]] is the only one that I can listen to all local, and even some elsewhere that is ineligible for me on [[ASIN:B004DM0UII XiiaLive Pro]] or TuneIn.<br /><br />The interface is a breeze to get through and to get used to. You can search songs, you can favorite songs; you can even tag songs, which is something that I haven't seen before. Overall, the app alone is pretty good. I just hope it gets improved by making more stations readily available.

0307346617|3.0|This book i bought cause I saw that it was made into a movie that is not out yet , so i figured i would read it before the movie but it is kinda boring and has not really caught my attention, too many different stories.
B005RJI67I|4.0|What's there to say?  It's a LEGO's Harry Potter Set.  The person I bought it for really likes Harry Potter, so...She really liked this gift.
B00A6N8F4Y|3.0|I watched the movie, was not too bad. I am not sure if I would ever watch it again though because it was just kinda to weird for me
B00A6PD8RQ|5.0|Amazing quality. Great watch for the entire family. Glad the rental time is up to 48 hours. Nice place to watch new movies not available on Netflix.
B005H29GSI|1.0|This one is overrated as the app is where it's at, they looked puzzled during Christmas trying to see how it worked. Arrived on time though.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I've been waiting to get my Kindle before I read the second and third books in this trilogy. Love reading the books on an ereader. This book was still full of action and mystery. I was wondering what else could happen that was any different from book 1, but Suzanne Collins reeled me in again. And now, I'm moving on to the third and final book in the series, Mockingjay. Happy reading!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|5 stars isn't enough for Hopeless...<br />Hopeless is a book that if someone ask whats it about I'd have to think real hard for an answer, because I tell them something, it would spoil it..<br />The story builds up and BAM , It gives you something, but that wasn't what you thought it was.. turns & twist . Love it, thank-you Colleen for writing this!<br />It keeps you waiting and waiting to the near end. I will read this book again in the future .
B008MWBY6W|4.0|[[VIDEOID:mo35H8P3SM6OPDA]]See video for an overview of the case. A great quick carry solution for those times you only need one lens.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|Well I've read all three books now. I KNOW the writing is horrible. In fact there are many things wrong with the writing.. which I think other reviewers did a good job explaining. The thing the bothered me the most is it is blatantly obvious that the author is not American and has the lead character drinking English breakfast tea reading English books and the geography is off.  However, if you can get past the writing the story is good and keeps you on your toes. The sex in this book is hot but gets to be unbelievable after awhile but it is still fun to read.  If you want a fun decent easy read this is for you. I really wanted to hate these books because of all the hype.  BUT it sucks you in and spits you out wanting more Ana and Christian.
B003MC5AV2|5.0|This is the third book I've read from this author. I have thoroughly enjoyed them all. I really liked the concept of this book. I loved how the lonely hearts club evolved and how each member evolved with it. The only criticism I have was some of the language used.
B009NQKPUW|4.0|Charlize Theron doesn't have as big a part as I had imagined, and the lead character emerges as a bit of a surprise. I won't spoil it. This seems like a prequel to the Aliens movies with Sigourney Weaver. The ending is not quite the usual Sci-fi cliche. More of a Hero's Journey film.
B009JBZH54|5.0|Such an awesome boxset. A great buy!!!!! Really like the extra features. My favorite trilogy, I wish there were more being sold at this amazing price
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game itself is really fun. I could play it for hours, but once while i was playing it, it froze completely and made this consistant buzzing noise. I had to completely shut down my kindle to make it stop. When i went back into the app after I turned my kindle on again, ALL of my characters, money, powerups, and my HIGH SCORE, was GONE!!! POOF!!!! Made me really mad, other than that, great app!!! Highly recomend.
0743216458|3.0|So far a good book. I visited last year some places on France i.e. Normandy.<br />Thank to this group of good soldiers for my freedom.
B004TTHLBE|4.0|A look at how we Americans have such a short attention span.  Everything has become so transient.  It's as if we go through life in a museum looking at objects for a minute or two then on to the next.  The book was well written and held my attention throughout.
B00A7ZWUJC|5.0|Album is good. Rihanna has received lots of feedback about this album being different from the rest. I feel she is growing as an artist and you can feel the growth in this album.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Fun little mindless game for times when I need to laugh.  The bird and piggy sounds are entertaining.  The level of difficulty does not lend to frustration.
B008OE05IG|5.0|This document makes me cannot stop watching it to the end. I actually knew little about sushi, and do not like it very much before watching this. After watching it, I feel so impressed by Jiro's sushi life. I really wish to learn more, and appreciate more about sushi now!
B00AE2LJVS|5.0|Lots of action adventure in this moonshine movie based on real Virginian family's life as moonshiners during prohibition. A must see.
B008GFI3QE|5.0|Everybody knows about John, Paul, George, and Ringo.  How about the guy who put it all together through thick and through thin.  The man who pollished the gem, and refined it into the greatest Rock/Pop band in history.  He wasn't perfect, but neither were they.  I loved this as it made me see what made him tick.  Well worth it.  Wish there was more.  Didn't know he was renowned for other groups, also!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|was glad to finally own it on DVD; have some friends that still need to be educated on good sci-fi series.
B002OTNF8Y|5.0|Knopfler knows how to pick.  He keeps to a minimum, guitar screeching, and goes for out and out great picking!.  They know how  to pick the audience up and bring them down gently when needed!  One of my great disappointments is that I never saw them live.  Although, this CD is probably the next best thing.  Try it, you'll love it!!
B0001I562I|4.0|I was very happy to find this movie on Amazon. This was one of my favorite movies when I was little and I am very happy that I am able to share it with my daughters. they call it the alligator movie (they cant say navigator). The only thing I was disappointed with is that I couldnt find it on blue ray,
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|it was so awesome. I wish I could get the full virtion I was so stuns when suSen looked like a alis I was awesome.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Iloved the Secret Keeper and the  developement of the characters, the detailed descriptions. I also loved the twists and turns in the plot. I was not able to guess what came next. I could picture this book being turned into a movie! Loved it!
B009NPA3Q4|5.0|I like the songs Phillip writes and the way he sings them.  I loved the Cd I purchased and his new songs.
B009JBZH54|5.0|love the movies and are better in Blu Ray. additional features make the exerience even better than usual. great buy
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book ever it makes you think but in a good way! If you read the book you would love this amazing book!
B0051UP5NQ|2.0|My primary reason for trying OfficeSuite was because I use PowerPoint slides as flashcards for studying.  Of all of the office apps for Android that I've tried, OfficeSuite has been the worst in rendering PowerPoint.  Animations will not work at all.  And fields entered via MS Office's Equation Editor are completely blank.  If the culprit is something which I'm doing wrong, I will update my rating.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I've read in a long time. It's so personal and suspenseful to the very end... breathtaking... \\"infinite\\".
B004DP9QFS|4.0|I use the Nova Launcher with TerraTime.  TerraTime's map looks far better with the Wallpaper Scrolling setting on \\"off\\" in Nova.  I do wish there was a \\"force landscape\\" mode either in TerraTime or on the Nova Launcher so that the entire world map is always on.<br /><br />I also wish that I could have more control over the orientation of the TerraTime globe widget.  There are only two choices for centering the display - \\"Device location\\" and \\"Sun longitude (daylit side).\\"  The ability to either set the orientation from the globe mode or by directly entering another location would be welcome updates.<br /><br />TerraTime is otherwise amongst the most beautiful of apps that you can put on your phone!
B0091REZMW|4.0|Game play is simple and entertaining.  It could easily become addictive. Hopefully they w I'll keep the games coming. Thanks for reading.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|These 3 books are the first I have read in a long time. So good I could not put them down.
B006G4F8OW|5.0|My daughter is a college sophomore at Edinboro (PA) University majoring in animation. She is a fan of &#34;One Piece&#34; and said she will put Luffy on her desk for inspiration after assignments like 300 drawings of one of her characters, William Wisp, swatting a ball.
B0097HSS4M|1.0|This is a terrible photo editing app. I couldn't understand how to use it and when I figured it out, I realized there's really nothing going on. I'll stick to PicsArt.
B004DM0UII|3.0|For 99 cents as opposed to 4.99, TuneIn Pro gives you more features (recording, notifications, and more) and more channels. As it's free today, you could compare this to the free version of TuneIn. This isn't a bad app, and its very simplicity may appeal to some, but there are plenty of better ones out there for free or a smaller price.
0823015033|5.0|Although I'm not going to follow all of the very specific instructions in this book, because my characters are not lifelike looking, it has very good instruction on how to, for me I'll take what I need, ie: how to create fingers and toes, eyes, the head etc.<br />The book was well thought out, and instructions are clear.
B007N8RULO|5.0|This game is quite addicting! Hours of fun for free! There are ads but they're super easy and quick to click out of.
B000TJ6BB4|5.0|My daughter's fiance had me order this for him as a gift for Christmas.  She was thrilled he remembered, and plays it all the time!
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I have great respect for the credentials of the author Dr. Eben Alexander III, however I truly found nothing very enightening about his story or the book.<br />Felt it was a waste of my time and money to have bought and read it.
0871164566|5.0|This is a wonderful book with lots of ideas for wire pendants.  It is absolutely addicting!  I've created what I call my Monstrosity Series because, once started, it's hard to stop!  I am having a lot of fun with this.
B004HD2ZHC|5.0|This is my first album by these guys and I am glad that I have come aboard.  I don't know a lot about their history except that they have apparently been around for a while.  \\"Tao Of The Dead\\" is a mix of progressive rock, post rock, punk and some straight forward rockers and ballads that are totally unique and fresh, but at the same time hearken back to an older era.  In fact the riff in the super catchy \\"Pure Radio Cosplay\\" almost sounds like an old Moody Blues rocker, and is catchy enough to be a single.  I am really enjoying this and plan on checking out more of the band's catalogue.  This is modern progressive rock as it should be done with forward thinking lyrics and musical ideas.
B009JBWOU0|5.0|I must say this is the best set I have ever bought. I love the packaging and the extras that come with it. Must buy!!!
B0051T47NQ|5.0|I first stumbled across this movie on Netflix and ended up buying it outright. This is a great movie to watch on a Friday night with lights off and a big bowl of popcorn - a good piece of entertainment. It's a bit scarier than I expected it to be so it's not good for kids (of course, the subtitles will turn them off, anyway). This movie has already been circulated around my office!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|oh my God this is one of my favorite strategy  games. its a good. way to have fun when your bored at a office or if you just Santa be comettive. GET THIS APP

B00992CF6W|5.0|minecraft is my favorite app on my kindle fire. the only way is if you don't like is then you hate building. what ever you want and blowing dynamite up and killing stuff for your survivall to live.  EVERYONE WHO READS THIS REVIEW THEN PLEASE GET THE APP.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Great book cant wait to read the final one in the trilogy. Going to go read the final book.hope this is . As good as the other two.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I think Suzanne Collins did very well on this book I would give it a nineteen out of twenty great job!
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I am always looking for a new fun free game or puzzle for my kindle fire and this one is fabulous! I love the graphics and amount of stuff to attack and eat. I lf you like hungry shark you will love this one!
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Finally bought this as I believe Adele has such a truely &#34;big voice&#34;. One or two arrangements I'd like to hear redone.
B0000549B0|5.0|This was so special; I didn't remember how good this movie was but we spent a most enjoyable evening watching this.
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I was hoping to read about his journey in plain English. I felt his description was almost a guessing game that I occasionally had to reread it to understand, scientifically too deep. Wouldn't recommend it to others.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I love this game!  But, that being said I have to say that sometimes Angry Birds make me angry (ha ha).
B002EWD0I6|4.0|got this for my mother.  she is enjoying it.  it takes her a long time to watch a movie she is always getting up to do chores at home.
B007PKSN6Q|5.0|I have listened to this CD everyday for weeks. Some of the songs are better than the originals. Even my kids love it.
B00ADYYBFI|5.0|Absolutely love it and was so happy to get it for a great price! I think it's the best new show in quite a while.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This app is so addicting and fun, great for long car rides or winding down time. And it is free,  how can you beat that?
B00129H7VS|5.0|Bought this for my husband for Christmas, at his request. I'm the one who's pestering him every night, asking if we can watch another Band of Brothers episode. Fantastic show!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|&#34;NO EASY DAY&#34; IS AN EXCELLENT LOOK INTO OPERATION AND CHALLENGES OF ELITE MILITARY<br />ORGANIZATION.  HEROS ALL! THIS COUNTRY IS WELL SERVED BY THESE PEOPLE.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|I've had this app for a long time but forgot about it. Recently rediscovered it and now it's better than ever. Lots of replay value trying to get all those stars and medals, and the different modes keep things interesting. There's something cathartic about crushing groceries...
B003UESJFG|5.0|This movie has no where near the marketing and popularity of other DreamWorks, but this is one of my family's favorite.  My kids are 5.5 and 4 and LOVE this movie (and all other DreamWorks).  This one is especially great for parents as the interaction between the Will Ferrell and Christopher Cross characters is great!  I think that is what makes this movie.  Give it a chance, you will not be sorry!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Great game to exercise my neurons and sanity...elegant,simple yet enough of a challenge to keep my brain engaged.Highly recommended. Kudos.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|When you read the book, you are predicting with scenes in your head. You are trying to guess what it would look like on the big screen.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|A great story with characters that you really get emotionally invested in.  Would have made a great trilogy with cross references to all characters already created but IMO the author seems to be headed down the Robert Jordan pathway of milking a good concept.  A shame really but that seems to be the course taken by George R.R. Martin also.  Regardless this book (on its own) is an excellent read.  I highly recommend it!
0812550706|5.0|Orson Scott Card is an amazing author. while i do not personally like the other \\"ender\\" books, i greatly enjoy this novel. while some may say it is far fetched, it is at the same time not at all. :D
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|Why is it a good book because it was the most popular articles on the most in a new one of the first place for a new study by books of the first to make me want to read a lot more than I used to
B009SJ3GUK|4.0|I hope they will continue with a season 3 as I have been hooked since the pilot aired in 2011.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|very funny.  she is the best.  i am sure she had a team of writers working on tbis with her.  nonetheless it is great.  hilarious.  miss her from days on s n l
0061900656|5.0|My son treats his sister better after I read him this.  At least for a few hours.<br /><br />I highly recommend it to anyone expecting a new addition to their family, as sibling rivalry is very real.
0446343129|5.0|I read this book years ago and passed it onto my husband who at the time was a sugar holic---after reading this he quit sugar and lost 50 lbs in 6 months!!
B000009DUY|5.0|John Williams classic album - Hymn to the Fallen is the most amazing piece of its kind! A wonderful tribute to the men who died to preserve our country.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this was a fun game. lots of different puzzles from most other games and the carnival theme was great too.
B00005NP04|4.0|As usual I enjoy listening to all of Martina Mcbride's songs. Ilove her voice and the messages that come across in her music.
B0096CDG0O|5.0|Having fun playing with others and response/turn registers quickly. The game also links up with Facebook so you can play with your Facebook friends.
B007HO392S|3.0|I don't think this cd is as good as her previous ones but I still enjoy some of the songs
B005HSL626|5.0|Great game. I'm addicted to Fruit Ninja. I can't believe it was free.This is the first & only game I have on my kindle.
B0092MKFIY|5.0|Well, I must anyway, considering I've bought this album twice.  I previously purchased the EP, but there were songs on this version that weren't included on the EP.  Though, I'm glad I bought the EP also, because there are two songs on that one that weren't included in the regular album.<br /><br />EP - included &#34;Round and Round&#34; and &#34;My Fault&#34; (I really love the latter, great song)<br /><br />Regular - includes &#34;Tiptoe,&#34; &#34;Amsterdam,&#34; &#34;Hear Me,&#34; &#34;Every Night,&#34; &#34;Bleeding Out,&#34; &#34;Underdog,&#34; and &#34;Nothing Left to Say/Rocks&#34;<br /><br />The other four songs are included in both albums.<br /><br />I found this band by accident.  It was one of the Amazon recommendations I received months ago, and boy, was it spot on in my musical preferences.  I immediately fell in love with &#34;Radioactive&#34; and &#34;It's Time,&#34; so I wasn't surprised when I started hearing them on the radio and being covered on Glee.  The songs are all different sounding, but work so beautifully together on this album.  I hate getting an album that I can't tell one song from another, they all sound the same, but every song on this album is a breath of fresh air and I can listen to the whole thing over and over (and I do).<br /><br />There isn't much I can add, as far as how fabulous I think this band is, that hasn't already been said, but I think they deserve another 5 star rating.  Can't wait for the next album!
075669812X|5.0|Well done book, comprehensive with a lot of pictures.  My son loves it.  Highly recommended.  Also it is hard to find a green Ninja (who knew)?
0061733199|5.0|I purchased this for my Son-In-Law because he is into survival strategies.  He has read about 1/4 of the book and is very impressed with it.  I made the right purchase.
0345803485|5.0|The modern day women's equivalant of the old Harlequin Romance paperbacks. always keeps you coming back for more. As a middle age woman in menopause, we can always dream, can't we?
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I am not the most avid reader, as I lose interest easily while reading (adult A.D.D.?) - this book was a good read. :)
B0086449YA|5.0|Admittedly, I adore MK's music -- his incredible guitar work, versatility, and lyrical gifts. But Privateering is an astounding achievement. The musical influences span from medieval ballads to blues, each song a gem. If you're already hooked, you'll be delighted to see that once again, there are always surprises, unexpected dimensions. And if you don't know Knopfler, what a treat to dive in here. Great piece of work. Privateering is a must-listen, must-keep listening joy. Get it now!
0345803507|5.0|I LOVEED THE FIRST TWO BOOKS AND COULDN'T FIND THE THIRD ONE EXCEPT ON LINE.  LOVED IT BEST OF ALL!
B0083Z614S|5.0|An old classic about a crippled boy hidden away in a mansion after his mother's death. Mary, sent to the mansion after her parents deaths, discovers Colin in the middle of the night as she is wandering the hallways.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|I liked it and told several others about it.<br />Easy to read. Always good to expand your understanding the riddles of life.<br />Buy it for your friends who think they are a brain,the whole brain, and nothing but the brain.<br />It may send them into new horizons.
B0034G4P4Y|5.0|from a devoted Tin Tin fan - this fulfilled all my expectations.<br />Spielberg is a fantastic movie maker all around
B00004Z1GH|4.0|How about a metaphor on the meaning of life?<br />There's a moment in this film when the Ted Pikul character turns to the Allegra character and says something along the lines of \\"we are fumbling around here with no idea where we are going or what we are doing\\", and to me that is the essence of what Cronenberg wanted to achieve in this film. I mean, at a real basic level, isn't that what we are all doing in our lives anyway?<br />And that to me, is the genius of this film. It's a very profound look at life wrapped up in the guise of a virtual reality thriller, and an entertaining one at that. Not only that but it holds up well under repeated viewings.<br /><br />I'm not sure which dvd version is the best, but the one I have is from Canada & it has extras like multiple audio commentaries including one from the director which is a fascinating listen.<br /><br />4.5 stars.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|I thought this book was interesting, but it was so sad.  From the beginning, there was no hope for a happy ending.  The book kept my attention and I wanted to continue reading, but I'm not sure why.
0679882820|5.0|It is a lot of fun to read this one to the baby. Great sounds and pictures. Can't wait to add more books like this one.
B002ZTIILC|5.0|I just received this CD today and it came with no scratches or bumps or other deformities. It plays like a charm and came in the original packaging, still wrapped in the stupid plastic stuff that is impossible to get off. I would really recommend this to anybody!
072325804X|5.0|My daughter loved Beatrix Potter books so I thought this would be great to start my grandaughter's library with this one.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very easily hooked on it, it's a love story that I would have never expected. Definitely a book worth reading.
B0099116AY|5.0|At first I wanted to see this anticipated movie while it was released in theaters, then thankfully I was treated to this as a Christmas gift...and couldn't be more pleased with viewing it at home. Meryl Streep (Kay), Tommy Lee Jones (Arnold) and Steve Carrell (Dr. Feld) go free-form in therapy in Great Hope Springs, Maine.<br /><br />One piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of bacon with one egg, one piece of...Ok, you get the idea here. Like Arnold's unchanging daily breakfast, their marriage of Thirty-One years is stuck in a routine, and hurt feelings. Kay, feeling ignored, inhibited and unfulfilled after all these vested years, decides to investigate for help. Will curiosity kill this cat...or awaken the sleeping lion?<br /><br />Eventually, she finds Dr. Feld's book in the bookstore. While at home she jumps on the internet to find out about, then book a stay for, intensive marriage therapy. A first disgruntled Arnold refuses although does end up in Maine along with Kay.<br /><br />The small town is lovely, atmospheric as it is by the water, quaint and really a place that most would love to visit. Kay immediately thought how great it was to be there while Arnold thought it over-priced, one positive and one negative as they start their sessions with Dr. Feld.<br /><br />What is so interesting about therapy with these actors, is that it is all done unrehearsed. Director David Frankel usually chooses to take the first cut. Causing it to go in this direction provides the viewers with seeing; very personal reactions, facial surprises, uncomfortable movements, candid speaking, outbursts and all the rawness of being vulnerable without a filter.<br /><br />While Kay is constantly pulling and fiddling around with the buttons on her cardigan, Arnold is grimacing and staring down Dr. Feld. The tension is perfectly palpable as the couple is learning all about each other all over again, and that things just have to change.<br /><br />This intensely personal look into marriage on the inside is a great opportunity to learn a few things for yourself. A brilliant and slightly comedic drama, more for adults who can see the reasons why some just refuse to give up.ge on the inside is a great opportunity to learn a few things for yourself.

B009JZTOG8|5.0|Didn't know whether they could keep the storyline interesting after Season 1, but Season 2 is also great.  Can't wait to see what happens in Season 3!
B00A9X9VAI|1.0|I was waiting for this movie for what seemed like a very long time.<br />I was extremely disappointed - so much I had to turn the movie OFF!<br />Awful direction - the world already has enough darkness - I thought a movie including quantum physics may include more light.<br /><br />When the 'good guy' isn't really, there is no one to root for.<br />I don't know how it ended, but it wouldn't matter from where I could see and feel the writer was taking us.<br /><br />This is a movie where I didn't care for not one of the characters, which is when a story dies.<br /><br />I have only turned off a handfull of movies in my 40+ years and this was one of them.
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Obviously any transfer of this classic film represents a compromise, yet this is as close to perfect as a home video release of LoA can get(until the nest gen of equipment).
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is great, but it can put some pretty gross images in your head. I strongly recommend this book to anyone who wants to read a great book.
B00ACBN9CI|2.0|The image of the aircraft blurred across the screen.  Sluggish. Nice idea...I wish it worked but it didn't work for me.
B004LROUNG|4.0|Good story for Grisham fans. I like all his books and this did not disappoint me.  Great suspenseful legal thriller.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|This album is great! Definitely in my top 5 of 2012. An album like an onion, lots of interesting layers that continue to expose themselves with continued listening. I don't always love \\"layered\\" music, can seem fussy or overwrought, but there is such great musicality an integration in these songs. Buy it!
1451695195|5.0|I was taken aback by how intellectual, yet simple Eben was in describing his experience.  I have recommended this to several of my friends who are either open minded on life after death or who don't believe at all or who believe there is a life after this one.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I have ever read. I can really relate to the characters, and felt a connection to the book. I felt  sad when I finished the book and I think we all can learn from it.
0865479410|4.0|This is a well written, somewhat disguised self-help book on personal planning.  It would deflect the reader from too much positive thinking. It recommends the dropping of goals that are not actually leading to happiness, and through awareness moving to more appropriate, timely or rewarding goals. As Kenny Rogers sang, \\"Know when to hold em, know when to fold em ... know when to walk away.\\" The author also wisely suggests that one should sample possible activities that may frighten.  That is, between the lines Burkeman says be bolder.  Do sample the things on your avoid list.<br /><br />But regrettibly, the author also suggests that one might discard goals, simply because they are part of excessive semi-modern positivity. This reader thinks that would be terribly wrong. To do so would be to live in random world, just doing the next thing, since that could be what your subconscious desires.  This is the book's defense of Buddhist meditation, as I read it.  While mumbling \\"Om,\\" or counting breaths, one is supposedly free from goal obsessing, so that after his sitting he can move unconsciously into a successful course of action. No, this reader says that the Buddhist sitting, as an injection of mental peace, is great. But that's it for the sittings.  To do more than just sit with one's life, one does best with goals, about which one best thinks optimistically, oh dear ... positively.<br /><br />So this critic says, read Burkeman's book with enthusiasm, sampling its warnings about goal intensity and choice. But by all means, do keep, refine and pursue improved goals after reading ... properly allowing for alternatives, and sampling your feared dangers.  Thus, you will as Spock said, \\"Live long and prosper.\\" Oh, but wait, this is also in agreement with William Shatner (Capt. Kirk) who is cited as encouraging impossible levels of positivity in the first chapter of \\"The Antidote.\\"
B005MMYCY6|5.0|There were times during this movie when I asked myself &#34;why did that just happen?&#34;  But the ending ties everything together and answers all questions.  An odd movie at times, but entertaining throughout.  Enjoy!
B005HSG3VK|1.0|I had to return it.  I did not fit the Kindle Fire as described.  Very cheap material - a piece of crap.  Don't order this.
0670023329|5.0|Very sad, true story about North Korea.  It is hard to believe that humans are treated so poorly and the abuse is so overwhelming.<br /><br />The book is well written and the story is easy to follow.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|First book I have read from this author and it was very good.  Some parts I thought, it this even revent, but it all pulls together to make a fantasic story.  Intense book but a page turner until the end.
B008NMT684|4.0|I wish it was a little less sensitive with placement. My 18 mo. old loves it.  Great app! Would purchase again.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|Impressed with this lightweight durable slick looking case, protects my kindle fire and is really functional. I'm very glad I spent a little more for this case, compared to the cheap one my father bought this is far better, great product!
B007V65R54|4.0|Even though I purchased the book to read about politics I was very interested in the info in the book.
B007KAJG3K|5.0|Great acting, highest production values, clever story and beautiful photography. Possibly better than the first Robert Downey Sherlock Holmes.<br />Excellent sound and film score. Blu-ray DVD wonderful!
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|I understand that this is the first of the Jack Reacher novels and it is a good one . I have read a couple of other ones and had to get this one to see what the first was like.  I was not disappointed.  A little unlikely but it was a good action story.
1609611543|5.0|I've tried some of the wheat free/gluten free products & I have no problems with the taste of them....I will get the cookbook as soon as it comes out or one very similar to it....The wheat free quick oatmeal is great, it has more fiber & texture to it when you put it in the microwave unlike regular quick oatmeal....
B008FYZIVY|5.0|What I though would be torture and a simply a thoughtful present for my significant other turned out to be quite fun and addictive.
B0050Q3TDY|5.0|great if you love jazz. I listened to the bebop and hardbop channels. if the other channels are as good, I' 'll be completely satisfied.
B00ATSBIIG|5.0|Love this game. So much fun and beautiful graphics. Worth every cent. Glad it can be played with no time limit if you just want a relaxing game.
B002ZG9846|2.0|I love the movie; however, I purchased this version of the movie because it came with the digital copy. I tried running the digital copy in my windows computer and it told me the code was expired.  I contacted the company and their response was that the digital copy is no longer available for this movie.  I then tried the digital copy with Itunes and it worked.  Unfortunately I no longer use an iphone and switched to android.  Do not buy this version if you wish to use the digital copy with a non apple device.
B0093LFGMO|5.0|Great album. Solid pop production and signature Robbie Williams sound. Although his voice may have changed a bit, he is no less a singer than he ever was. Perhaps the world's greatest living entertainer.
B005MJ883K|5.0|Bought this for my 15yo son. He hasn't put it down. Everyone who picks it up loves it.  It is very challenging and a lot of fun.
098555780X|3.0|Out the gait, #8 picture on page 3 shows cord under the right cord, but text states &#34;over&#34;.  Maybe I'll just google it to determine what is correct.  Hope the rest of the book is accurate.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Learned a lot about the beginning of Unions and the rights of workers vs some of the rich land owners and their subterfuges.  Hope all 'owners' do not act with such disregard for their production crews.  Enlightening regarding the WWI and the bitter truth of the battlefield and history.
B00008CMR6|5.0|Rio Lobo is a great John Wayne movie with a lot of action all the way through. I would recommend it to any one that's a John Wayne movie fan or a fan of western movies.
B0070R8WY2|5.0|This is one of my favorite records of 2012 if not my favorite. Sharon sings heartbreaking and heartfelt songs that are intensely gripping and beautiful. Her penchant for melody is striking not to mention the potency of her lyrics. I simply cannot get over the power of her voice. It's cathartic listening to her sing. I'd recommend this record to anyone.
0425264351|5.0|I have not personally read this book, but the friend that I purchased this gift for says that he can barely wait for his lunch break to read just a few more words.  I hope he lets me borrow it soon.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Great story and very well acted. Would definitely recommend. A little slow in the beginning but then gets going into the story.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book was so much fun to read, the perfect vacation entertainment. Flynn writes the voice of male and female characters very well, is quite funny, and fills the novel with plot twists and suspense. Highly recommended!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|This was the first free book I've read on the kindle and it was way better than expected. Granted it wasn't the next Harry Potter, but it kept me reading. I devoted the whole thing in 3 hours, tempting me away from all that studying for finals. If you need a good distraction, look no further.
B009JBZH54|5.0|This is the best version of batman with the coolest fights, batmobile, and villains out of all in the franchise. I received my movie order within 3 days on a standard delivery. I highly recommend it for all who love batman.
1452110581|5.0|Purrfect for any cat lover. It's a good laugh out loud/ feel good book that's nice to have around. Good price and arrived on time.
B00AJRQLTI|2.0|In an opera, the music IS the story, and Les Mis is an opera. In the film, the performances are raw and powerful. You'd think the studios would have enough respect for the actors to remaster the music for the soundtrack. This sounds like somebody took an MP3 recorder into the movie theatre and then released it as a soundtrack. Not to mention the fact that they didn't even include one of the most important songs in the film, \\"Can You Hear the People Sing\\". Hard to have a musical about a revolution without their revolutionary anthem. Some songs cut off abruptly at the end and you have to constantly adjust the volume while listening. You know you have a bad recording when you have to turn the volume ALL THE WAY UP just to hear it. Waste of money. What a shame.
B009NQKPUW|5.0|It was a great movie! I didn't realize it was a prequel to the movie &#34;Alien&#34; till I started watching it. Great movie, I'll watch it many more times.
B00APUQT7I|3.0|While Ice Age Continental Drift was entertaining, I thought it was not quite as good as the previous Ice Age movies.
B001TAJGO6|4.0|Easy to use. It's a well plotted, well acted movie but very depressing which is just my personal opinion, but still worth at least one watch.
B006LSZECO|4.0|While it started out fairly slow, I got where I couldn't put it down.  Very unusual perspective and story plot.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I loved this book, a little uncomfortable at times but it was good! Great story behind it. I didn't like the ending though.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|You should make it so it will work on my rooted kindle please i cant get my books on it unless u fix the app
1439153663|4.0|There isn't much new in the plot of this story, but the way the author creates the bonds between the characters is captivating.  I felt like they were members of my own family as I was reading.  You find yourself really and truly caring about what happens, and hoping and hoping for them to work things out.  This is a terrific read and I am looking forward to reading more by Kathleen Grissom.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|this calculator app is great. a simple app with no bells and whistles to worry about. the big buttons let me to 10 key type entry so its fast to use. it also keeps track of recent transactions
159514188X|3.0|This was a book club book for my 13 yr old's group.  I actually was intrigued by the way the story was written and the whole idea behind it.  I did think it felt a bit manipulative, and I found myself worried that the girls might think that being so manipulative is a permissable thing to do.  Watch the age of the person reading this book as there were some parts of it that were definitely for mature audiences.  In the end though, the message of &#34;what you do impacts people more than you may realize&#34; is incredibly important for kids and adults too!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|It was the best game I have ever played on my Kindle Fire until one day when I tried to start the game it sent me back to the &quot;bookshelf&quot;. I tried everything I could think of. I got so annoyed that I uninstalled the re-installed it. I lost my previous city and had to completely start over. Big letdown.
B004DM0UII|3.0|I would like to say tunein radio is much better, if not just as good. Luckily it was free, which is why I got it. I can't imagine anyone paying for something you can get for free.
B004R13U6Y|4.0|Works much better than the Kindle Fire's own PDF reader, I can actually read the files now and see the covers of the PDF books as well.
B007N8RULO|4.0|Great game. Even with the ad interruptions. The game is easy to run and figure out. Fun to play every day
B0092MKFIY|5.0|I have been an Imagine Dragons fan for almost 2 years. I love this album. My favorite songs is &#34;Demons&#34; which is not played on the radio. Definitely worth the buy!
B00AMBK0X4|5.0|I really enjoyed Ted. What a great movie. I had fun and laughed a lot. This movie is not for kids. Even though there is a funny, talking teddy bear. I plan to watch this movie over and over.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Pretty fun. Sometimes feels like it is too much of a commitment and relies way too much on needing gifts from other players
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|This certainly inspired by Minecraft but they have done a better job than the Minecraft Pocket Edition (at least so far) and they have also worked hard from just making it a copy.  In their forums the focus is on what the game needs to be better... not what it needs to be more like Minecraft.  I applaud this kind of thinking.  I'd much rather see any game clone take the original idea and then run in their own direction.  To me, that's the idea.  It's the difference between being inspired by a great game idea and simply stealing an idea.  SurvivalCraft is definitely working to become their own game, not simply a clone.  Kudos!
B00992CF6W|5.0|need a new update like dispensers. and villagers<br />and redstone able to mine enderman<br />l o v e m I n e c r a f t r o c k
0439023491|5.0|This is a great book.  I can't wait to see the movie.  Could not put the book down.  Great series.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Couldn't put this book down! You are pulled in different way all the way to the end of the book. Really enjoyed this book!
B003L77GG0|5.0|Got to have, it's the last season.  Love this series, wish it didn't end.  But it was good while it lasted.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love this app.  It is so much easier and quicker than on my pc. It is more fun now.
0439023513|5.0|This is a great book.  I can't wait to see the movie.  Could not put the book down.  Great series.
B001UV4XHY|5.0|I loved it and can't wait to watch part 2.  I really waited a long time to finish the series.
B000YAA68C|5.0|This is a really good love story.  Everyone should have this DVD in their collection.  It's truly a good love story.
B008XG1X18|5.0|This works really and is much more convenient that on my pc. Now I can pin to my hearts content.
0439023521|5.0|This is a great book.  I can't wait to see the movie.  Could not put the book down.  Great series.
B004UID2LC|1.0|it is the most worse app you will ever see so don't get it because if I were you I would so not get this app
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Hope Springs was okay. I love Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones, but I don't know  who the target audience is. Young people cannot relate adn older people would have issues with the topic. Some funny moments, but over all the movie was a little sad.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Disturbing book, I did not like the ending.  I needed more closure.  It was a page turner until the end.
B0006HJEMC|4.0|My daughter and I put this model together over the course of about 3 days. perhaps it could have been done faster but we were having a good time bonding and enjoying each other. the model is a bit smaller than i though but great for a 12 year old. I would have given this 5 stars if it werent for it being smaller and we had to do some carving since the mold didnt make the cleanest pieces.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book will grasp any and all readers. Asher wrote a page turner that allows the reader to connect to and fall in love with the characters. I recommend this to anyone looking for a good read especially if you are struggling with depression or anything to that effect.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Great book & enjoyed every bit of the reading. Usually I don't like books like these but all my friends raved so I thought I would read...glad I did.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book is a wonderfully quick read. You are exhausted at the end but fulfilled in some odd way. Highly recommend.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|This is a great app if you use e-bay. It works just like the website on my PC. So this way I do not have to be home to shop or check on orders
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I really like this game and I have advanced to all the levels.I would say I love it but I never win.Not even once.What the heck?? If anyone out there that is a real person and not a computer,has ever won please send me a comment.This is ridiculous.I have played for hours on my boring down time and nothing,not a win,not evven close.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|The one that started it all!! Rovio has done a great job with this concept. Great time killer! Love it!
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have a friend that is older and spends a lot of time alone. After playing the game I told her about it. She loves it and it helps to pass the time for her
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really like this version of Angry Birds! They keep adding seasons so that is a big plus! One of my favorite apps!
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I love it, it is one of the most addicting story games I have ever played. It doesn't get boring and they are always coming up with new things to do. And there are plenty of ways to earn gems, unlike others where you cant continue without them. Overall one of my most favorite games.
B000SEGUDE|2.0|Book was very much overrated.I thought the book was overwritten or forced.  The story didnt flow even though all of the elements were there.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|The Box was a messand falling apart, but it did not effect the DVD. I am in the process of viewing.<br />I was happy overall.
B0087JTAKW|2.0|Mitch Albom is a wonderful writer.  He knows how to pull on the heart strings.  Even though he engaged my emotions in the story, he wasnt able to engage my mind.  The story was predictable and boring.
0345803493|5.0|Couldn't wait to get started. I wasn't disappointed, love to read this author. Highly recommend to adult readers. Love it.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|Awesome DVD set.<br />I'm not super nerd, so I don't care and or freak out about the colors changing.. if they even did.<br />Looks good, sounds good. Great collectible item, or gift.<br />Just get it.
0345803507|5.0|Love freed.  It is written good and has great twists and turns, keeps you busy guessing the end. Highly reccomend.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|Good at first but once you reach a level over 120 it becomes boring because you never run out of coins.  And there no really exciting goals to attain
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|so i got the Anker High Precision Laser Gaming Mouse with 8000 DPI, 9 Programmable Buttons, Weight Tuning Cartridge, Omron Micro Switches. i have been using it no stop for 2 weeks now, its a fast mouse the settings on it r awesome. i will add more after i put it to the test of hard core gaming, an ill post my findings
0345525558|3.0|I got it for a book club read.  I feel quite a bit was left out- how and why, etc.
1611748755|5.0|Life of Pi is a many-layer novel that is both funny and enchanting.  Having a perfect reader makes all the difference.  I have now read the book, listened to the audio version, and seen the movie.  So do I like this novel?
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great book I loved it. Allot of sex but very good story line and drama. It was very well written!
B0086700CM|5.0|Fun and addictive game. Whenever I'm bored I just open this app and play. This is definitely one of my fav apps ever.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|it will take you for a ride and then spit you out. great story line, great acting and although scify not cheesy at all. this movie has all elements of suspense and action while keeping you guessing about whats next. this will be added to my collection.
B00280LYHS|5.0|Great book! My 8 year old son has read two of the Riordan  series and thought they were all awesome.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the worst of the three because it left you wanting so much more.....where are the details about the wedding...etc etc. Great book overall I love the series & only have complaints because I wish there was more to read!
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Permanently overclocked to 4.3 GHZ using only the multiplier and cooled with a Noctua 6 Dual Heatpipe with 140mm/120mm Dual SSO Bearing Fans CPU Cooler NH-D14.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I was skeptical at first about spending the $ on this series. I had read a lot of mixed reviews....I was not at all disappointed. Sure the book could have used another round of editing but it is a best seller for a reason. It is sexy provacative intriguing and an all around great read. I could not get enough of these books! Great intimate imagery, great action and romance a welcomed trifecta!
B00ARAO720|5.0|I loved the movie and it played well on the laptop we were using. It wasn't blurry or anything of the sort.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show! Well worth the buy or rental, whichever is preferred. Cant wait for next season too be released and new episodes in February
B000OZ0NXA|5.0|After being highly disappointed with my favorite authors, James Patterson and Patricia Cornwell's books for the past couple of years, I decided to venture out and find something new, fresh.  This book has captured and maintained my attention from the get-go.  I don't want to put it down.  Something that I used to feel for the writers listed above.  I can't wait to finish this one and go on to the next in the series.
B0053TMP24|5.0|Another awesome book! (And horribly awesome cliff hanger) This was my 4th time reading it, and I plan on reading it again sometime.<br />I remember when I had first finished it last year, I was so frustrated. October? NOOOOOOOOOOOOO! (LOL, I had seriously thought there was one more chapter and had flipped the page)
B002N5N5LG|5.0|Quick shipping, brand new in wrapping, no complaints. This is, no doubt, the best comedy I have ever seen on television. The writing is TOP NOTCH and everything from the acting to the story-lines, to the cinematography is EXCELLENT. I have personally watched every episode of this series about 4 times and it is still above and beyond anything out there right now on my 4th watch.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|I heard the game was good and found out it was better than I thought its so addicting and fun I can play it for hours a day
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This was a great book and I really enjoyed book one and two. Book one and two kept me engaged and wanting to see what happened next!  I also liked book three, however the ending was a bit silly...
1401322786|2.0|This was a snorefest...slow moving, an original concept put to to sleep. It's not a terrible book but what a reach. Mitch Albom has officially slumped himself into a category occupied by pseudo spiritualists like Thomas Kincade and JZ Knight.  Egad man...come up with something a little bit more perky.
B000F8O35U|5.0|I LOVE the Little Mermaid!  My daughter has been watching the movie since we received it!  It shipped quickly and I appreciate that!
B00ADS98FC|5.0|Pitch Perfect is funny and entertaining, I laughed all the way through. Great characters, with really good voices and excellent soundtrack.
B007IXWL2C|3.0|I LOVED the series of books, however I felt this last one was a bit rushed and the ending was silly.... Only my opinion!  I would have liked it to end a bit differently.  All in all good book though...
B000BNI99K|1.0|I expected the Rod Stewart raspy voice that I'm accustomed to and what I found was a voice of a little girl.  These are songs I listened to growing up in my mother's house and love them.  Very disappointed.
1423113454|5.0|OK, so if you like this book, visit the web site for even more fun.  And the British museum has lots of information of the Egyptian gods, as well as games to play and more.
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|and it is just simply the best ever. Leonard and team just can't be beat. We were in audience in November and at age 78, he is a master. We love you, Leonard. So grateful to you and your team for a very memorable experience.
0810993139|1.0|Thsi kid is a poor role model and is put forth as an ok person.  So I don't want my students or children to read just OK stuff, where there is so much out there that is great.  Don't waste your time.
B0063IH60K|1.0|I know it's free but the over powering advertising constantly pops up and is annoying.  Otherwise it's a great game.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Interesting plot and easy to read.  Comedy, drama, mystery, and history book all in one.  Would recommend this to any reader.
0345803507|2.0|this was a request for a gift by my daughter.  The product was poorly wrapped and shipped in a haphazard manner.  Book cover was torn upon receipt
B009FB3XTA|5.0|ALL THE VARIOUS ARTISTS ARE EXTREMELY TALENTED & GREAT TO LISTEN TO.  I HAVE ALL FOUR SOUNDTRACKS FOR THE TWILIGHT MOVIES & LISTEN TO THEM ALL THE TIME.
0345803485|3.0|Was requested as a Christmas gift.  Book received in a timely fashion.  Packed in a standard manner with no issues
B0095XPZBC|4.0|Like the first season, season 2 looks great in high definition. However, they changed the film stock in year 2, and it shows with a lot more graininess on Blu-ray in some scenes. But no matter, the effects shots look terrific, and if for nothing else, the &#34;director's cut&#34; of Measure of a Man makes the whole set worth getting.
B004DM0UII|4.0|This radio app is very nice with a lot of options. It is a bit confusing until i found the 'use-help video' in the settings options of the app. Then after watching it was great. Thanks so much!
B006TLF5WM|5.0|I usually like Jason Statham movies and then add Clive Owen and Robert De Niro to the list and you know the movie is bound to be good, I love action movies. That being said I didn't think i would like this movie as much as I did.<br />In movies, especially action or 'assassin' movies the killing is pulled off with pyrotechnics and flashy fight sequences and over the top gun battles.<br />This movie did have it's fair share of car chases and some really impressive fight scenes, but the part that I found stuck with me the most, was just how intimate (for lack of a better word) the killing was. In most movies killing is distanced or in the heat of battle or there is a reason for the killing in the first place some justification for why the person deserves to die. A basic revenge plot line. This movie gave you no such thing, while I rooted for Danny (Jason Satham) I found myself feeling empathy for his targets. They were soldiers, maybe they did some questionable things, but they were following orders and in war I can only assume that things get messy and the lines get blurred very quickly.<br />I also found it interesting how the character's interacted with one another, and their varying view points, Clive Owen with his taking the death's personally, these were soldiers fellow ex- SAS and the fact that a team of killers was taking out men who had sacrificed for their country was very personal for him.<br />Danny in some ways had a much colder outlook which matched with who he had been and what he had done in the past, these killings were just a means to and end, the release of his long time friend and mentor and yet at the same time you knew he was struggling with his 'newly' aquired conscience.<br />Over all this movie was wonderfully done.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Brings out the woman in you! Cannot wait for the movie to come out! I just hope they pick the right characters.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Gladwell makes you look at success from a new perspective. without preaching, he makes you realize what you need to change and why you are the way you are. his best book out there. a must read!
B00932ANQM|3.0|The book was better.  If you haven't read it then you should.  I did not like the people they chose to play the characters.  When I was reading the book I invisioned it differently.
B009WO7NQO|1.0|there are almost no levels and you have to buy the third level this game isn't woorth it do not buy it
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Brings out the woman in you!  Cannot wait for the movie to come out! I just hope they pick the right characters.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is awesome but they need to add armor redstone and the nether to make it better theman it is now.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Brings out the woman in you! Cannot wait for the movie to come out! I just hope they pick the right characters.
B007PQG27C|1.0|This ebook was scanned in the wrong orientation resulting in  cropping of each and every page. Until resolved I would highly suggest avoiding.<br /><br />I own the Dover press paperback and highly recommend the title just not from this scanned version.
B001KWTBVQ|5.0|This movie never gets old! One of the best love stories of all times! Drew Barrymore is amazing in this.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Fast shipping, easy payment transaction. I have watched all of them a few times each and there is no skipping, no scratches, no damage at all. Wonderful purchase.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Loved this book! So suspensful! Very predictable but isn't every love story? I cannot wait to see this movie in February! I have the release date on my calender!
B00A9C3RB8|3.0|Meryl Streep and Tommy Lee Jones are excellent actors, so the movie was good only because of them.  The story line was too realistic for my taste--I prefer to be entertained rather than suffer through someone else's problems.  I was uncomfortable with their openness about their sex life, probably because I am of the older generation where such discussions were taboo.  Today's young people would think nothing of it.
1421550644|5.0|Magical book.  Amazing. A lot better than the movie, a little different but definitely worth the while. Buy this! If I could give it six stars out of five I would.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Enjoyed this whole book series and can't wait for the movies to bring it to life!!!  Collins did a wonderful job of depicting true to life characters. 100% recommend the whole series for readers young and old.
B004GUSG4M|3.0|Had a twist I didn't expect, and I'm always looking for those kind of books.  (However it was so in some spots.)
B009CPJHY4|1.0|Amazon for whatver reason over the holidays had TERRIBLE download service - the stars are a reflection of the download, not the movie.<br /><br />From what we did see of the move itself, it was delightful!<br /><br />Now I have to figure out how to get my money back from Amazon - this also happened the day after Christmas when we tried to watch \\"The Campaign\\".<br /><br />I am happy to report that Amazon IMMEDIATELY refunded my money, and the movie was enjoyed.<br /><br />Overall - I would change my rating to three stars from one.
B004WGGQPQ|4.0|My kids and I love this app. It has kept my 4 year old entertained for hours and wastes no paper which I love! The only thing I think that could use improving is adding a more accessible clear page button/erase button.
B007HU7NBK|4.0|I really enjoyed this book,  I was a huge Durannie back in the 80's.  I expected to be bored by and skip over the beginning portion where he talked about his early life, but I was interested through the entire book. Of course, John didn't have much pre-Duran life to talk about, but the years he did discuss tied in nicely with the whole book. He gave great info on his superfamous years, plenty of gentlemanly dish here to satisfy Duran Duran fans. I liked that he didn't badmouth anyone or get nasty - if you are looking for a more raw, brutal rockstar bio, check out &#34;The Dirt&#34; or &#34;The Heroin Diaries&#34;. All in all, this is a decent book that I consider a must-read for serious fans.  I deducted a star because a few sections and especially the end felt rushed or &#34;glossed&#34; over, particularly about his first and current marriages...I'd have liked to learn more about the big loves of his life, including his daughter. I felt he could have gotten more in depth about them and his relationships with his bandmates without crossing the line.  Some of the chapters feel a little reserved or &#34;phoned in&#34;.  A-
0553381709|5.0|ordered for my son who requested it as he has always enjoyed the authors books and is sharing it with others
B00940XIGU|5.0|Great beats and artist collaboration! I would definitely recommend this album to anyone that is a fan of dance music.
0553582038|5.0|ordered for my son who enjoys all of george rr martins books. Ihave been ordering these for years for him
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I am always looking for a new author especially in the Science fiction genera. Hugh Howey reminds me of another favourite author, Jasper Fforde.<br />A very fine read, looking am looking forward to reading more from Mr. Howey!
B007FEFLTO|5.0|any book by ken follett is well worth reading. his stories draw you into them so quickly you don't want to put it down and don't want the story to end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved it and I hope other people who read it also enjoy it. There was never a part that I didn't like.
B004SIP7AS|1.0|Section 8 had captions that could not be removed.  Often disc became blurry thus impossible to watch. unfortunately did not view until after return date.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I hope there is a movie but it will probably never be as good as the book.  I liked it very much.
B0079R8KXG|4.0|Well, the dog hasn't eaten it yet so I guess it's good. It has a nice feel. I'm not sure<br />the kindle really stands up in it - maybe I need to bend it more.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Love it! Finished the whole in two days. I couldn't put it down! It kept me wanting to know what was going to happen.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Gameplay is excellent. There are some minor UI, audio, and graphical issues, but those are far outshined by the strengths of the game's design. The creators have done an excellent job balancing challenge and reward - I frequently feel like I'm doing well while simultaneously being presented with difficult and challenging decisions. I'd say the one issue here is that when you feel like you're losing, you're absolutely going to lose. It's impossible to pull out a win in this game when you're losing; it's quite binary.<br /><br />The creators do try to squeeze a bit of money out of you, but not in an invasive or enraging way. You can spend money to unlock genes to improve your plagues. These genes can also be obtained through normal progression through the game. There are PDLC (paid/purchasable downloadable content) consisting of an additional plague type (more to come). Since the game was a dollar, and I've already gotten 12+ hours of enjoyable play out of the game, I'd have no issues purchasing additional plagues if I feel they will be well designed.<br /><br />If you're into strategy games or strategy simulator games, you should pick this up. Highly recommended.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|Luv it. Best book I've read in a very long time! Well time for book three hope it's just as good!
B009E3EY38|5.0|I bought 3 sets (2 for me and one for my sister) as the price dropped from $54.01 per set when first ordered to the final price of $29.00 per set! I pre-ordered these with the price guarantee.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book was very heart warming and depicts a great love story. It's a must read.<br /><br />p.s.- The move comes out in February, and it looks very good! (:
B00A6PD9I4|4.0|I didn't feel like this was the best movie ever put out by Pixar but considering their track record, is still a compliment.  I was a bit surprised by the naked butts in one scene.  It seemed more like humor one would find in a Dreamworks production.  The tale of a teenage daughter becoming more independent and the complex relationship it causes with her mother, is a tale as old as time.
B00280LYIM|5.0|I love this book ! The author has lots of detail.  I also like how he puts lots of humor into it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Really an engrossing story.  This is like reading about the games that entertained the Romans and kept them in line only with a modern twist using technology to help show how man can be cruel.  The tv part is  like Orwell 's 1984.  Hopefully man will evolve and no sink to such depravity.<br />Audrey
B002MQYOFW|5.0|One word amazing! This book is an absolute must read, even for non-readers, you'll love it. If you have seen the movie but haven't read the book, read it. There's so much background info. they didn't mention in the movie and since the book is written in first-person the movie couldn't  show you all of Katniss's thoughts. It's very we well written and even though it's a fun teen, fiction novel I feel as if there's a lot of deeper meanings to story that will be more exposed in the series.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|this game was great for a little while when I could solve the puzzles, then it got too hard and I'm just frustrated.
B0078XGEK2|5.0|I am reading this book at a difficult time in my life. It has\\"reminded\\" me about some things I had forgotten & opened my mind to New revelations 're: spiritual growth, God, Grace, psychotherapy & the dedicated work it takes each one of us on our own behalf to achieve a life of sanity, love & a real connection with God. I will read this book again & again as a reference. Afterthought: gave me insight into what one might wish to achieve with a good, caring & seasoned psychotherapist.
B003B5M0PO|5.0|EXCELLENT BOOK for any horsey person. Brought a tear and a smile all at once. Brilliant book. Loved it all. Well written and a captivating story.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great for girls of any age, and definitely fun and fantastic for the millions of people around the world who enjoy MLP.<br /><br />This game is accurate, has great quality, and in my opinion is wonderfully entertaining.<br /><br />Fantastic game for every pony!
B009JBZH54|5.0|The third installment of The Dark Knight provides an outstanding ending to the Christopher Nolan directed trilogy of \\"Batman Begins\\", \\"The Dark Knight\\", and \\"The Dark Knight Rises\\". While the third installment is a little slow to develop, it does not disappoint in telling the final story. It is recommended that you watch all three films back to back to back to fully appreciate the final story since so much of it revolves around \\"Batman Begins\\", rather than \\"The Dark Knight\\". I will watch these three films again many times because the stories as told by Mr. Nolan and the screenwriters are outstanding as told on the big screen.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Another great book.  I was not able to put it down. Can't wait to read the final book of the trilogy.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I used to watch my mom play this game and didn't get it. now I can play and it is a lot of fun!
B008Y1YKE4|5.0|This is funnier if you are British or like British style humor as the jokes are on the subtle side. My wife even laughed several times at grandsanta, and she's not usually one to watch British comedy.
B005HSG3TC|4.0|I am one of those people who tends to drop, lose, and break electronics. Whenever my boyfriend talks about getting some new device he usually looks at how &#34;Camie Proof&#34; it is, meaning how durable it is, or how it can be &#34;Camie Proofed&#34;. I have broken more pieces of technology in my lifetime than a missile exploding in the nearest Best Buy.<br />The Marware Lightweight MicroShell Folio Case Cover is indeed &#34;Camie Proof&#34; although I have been very careful with my Kindle so far. I have dropped my Kindle about four or five times (not very much compared to my track record) since I got it in August 2012 and it hasn't even gotten a scratch. The plastic on the backside of the case is especially durable. I love the flexible front panel feature because it is reasonably durable and extremely useful for propping my kindle up. I use my kindle for college because the free classic books come in handy for Core Humanities (History+English) so it is stuffed in my bag along with miscellaneous items.<br />The only downside with this case is that I can't get it off without being extremely careful that it doesn't pull the back of my Kindle Fire off when the edges of the case get caught in that crevice. Then again, why would I ever take this case off (other than to clean it)?!<br />Great case, worth the money!!
B00ARAO720|4.0|This was a great movie even though the whole movie took place in a couple hours and had great action and comedy thrown in.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Loved everything about it without a doubt! Graphics were very good! Storyline was also very fun! I'd recommend this to others
B007MJSQSK|2.0|Man your going to love the animation in this movie! I'd give it a great review if that was all that mattered to me as the movie viewer. It might even be a 4 or 5 star as a family or christian movie but looking at the the rest makes it all fall apart. The story unfolds like an old cheesy Nancy Drew mystery. Sorry guys but TinTin is ShallowShallow.<br /> P.S. if your a dog lover your gonna really love SNOW, (The pooch).
B007ZMHBBM|5.0|What Fun!! You have to be into \\"Blues\\" to Understand.  One of the Best Combinations of Artists I've heard and seen for that Era!!  I actually saw this show on a Television Broadcast a couple of weeks ago and they were selling the CD for $65.00 and the CD/DVD Combo for $85.00!!!!  I truly enjoyed the performance and wanted it; but way too much!! So, I checked your site and Whoaaa!! What a deal!!  Very Happy With the purchase!!  And, I found the Rolling Stones got their name from one of Muddy Waters Songs!!  Sweet!!
B00AMBLXP8|1.0|Kinda' reminded me of the older Eddie Murphy movies... You know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks. Then the sequal comes out and it's ...you know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks. Then his newest movie comes out and ...you know, whitty wise guy that can't act but has plenty of cheap whitty wise guy cracks.....................I think you get it by now.<br />I WANT MY 10 MINUTES BACK :(
B005GG0MIS|5.0|The book gave me lots of insight into history and the relationships between presidents that has not been openly reported in the past. Very interesting and a must read for people interested in leadership and our country's history.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love this app. I can sync my phone tablet and computer. it really helps me keep my business notes from meeting and I keep it as a journal.
B007TK77QE|4.0|I really enjoyed reading this book but had some initial concerns.  First of all J K Rowling killed her hero in the first chapter. It seemed a mistake at first but as I continued to read I saw the tragedy of it unfold and also the deft and fairly believable way in which J K Rowling  resolved the gap left by the casual vacancy.  I was also  concerned that all the characters still alive were quite unlovable - the hero had died at the beginning.  However by the end I could see that his work might continue if not exactly as he had planned.  Overall it is a disturbing book in many ways and I couldn't get over the feeling that the author was determined to put her stamp on writing for adults in a rather heavy handed way.  I would have liked a range of characters rather than lots of unlovable ones and a very few with some saving graces.  That said, I felt that , like many of the characters who benefited from his actions, it was a pity that Barry had died early as he had obviously started to make some unhappy lives better.  Of course Pagford is really a metaphor for society  at large.  I would recommend this book to those who like serious themes, thoughtful characterisation and well written plots.  If you are not one of them why not read \\"The Secret Keeper\\" as it is an easy read and no thinking is required!
B0094BB4TW|3.0|I like the app, it works fine for me. I can talk to my friends from the couch. However, the button typically used to attach a photo to a status or message seems to be nonexistent. Please fix.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I recently bought this for Christmas as my first blu-ray purchase. It's a great buy. I paid $40, shipping and all. The packaging is great, not cheap, flimsy cardboard or anything. The movies themselves are great, if you haven't seen them, you'll love them. The picture and audio is top notch. I've watched some of the special features and they're pretty interesting (and there's a lot of them!)I'm not sure but I'm pretty positive they're the same ones that come on the regular blu-ray versions so no new special features if you already have those. But I think the movies alone are worth the price. I haven't checked out the digital copies yet so I can't comment on that. But what some people may not like is the fact that The Dark Knight and The Dark Knight Rises switch formats throughout the movies due to IMAX. It personally doesn't bother me, it switches formats when there's a cut to a different scene, not in the middle of the same one. And the IMAX scenes look stunning anyways.<br />Overall, I was very happy with this. A great price for three great movies (plus a ton of special features.) If you don't own the movies, this is the way to go.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I love to play this game every time with my little sister! Not only that but she loves to play it all the time on road trips so she has something to do. This is an app that has many challenging games that keeps me wanting to play all the time. I recommend this app to anyone of all ages because even when you unlock a game you want to play it over and over again even though you have already passed it. I don't know why people write bad reviews, I got this app a year ago and I still play with it to this day, even my whole family plays it! Only if I'm not looking...:)
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|I finished this game in two days.  I loved the graphics and the storyline. Cannot wait for the next one.
B0027MJU00|5.0|It's not all cozy, warm and fuzzy with this author.  She travels to places inside of people that are scary and sad, but believable.  This book keeps you reading and wanting to know what happened on that fateful night.  It will yield unexpected emotions.  Be prepared.
B000001Y5D|5.0|que les puedo decir , es lo que me gusta en música , es relajante al escuchar el sonido de los instrumentos y la voz es el complemento perfecto para disfrutarlo y pasar un buen rato
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|This is a great game produced by the amazon. I like it and what's more its free!!!!!but I think there is a discrimination in this game
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|After purchasing this app I watched the awesome intro and when I touched play it ends the program. Tried the usual fixes like restarting my kindle and reloading the game.  None of that worked so I am out the money and can't really give a good review.<br /><br />Since I last wrote this review, I reinstalled the game one more time and it now works great. I also purchased the full version which I had thought I had done in the first place but turns out I was using the free version, and it's really an interesting and fun game. My former review of one star is now retracted and I give this game 4 stars for intersting storyline and play. My apologies to the developers as it seems it probably stopped working because I was at the end of the sample time, but nothing told me that. I purchase so many apps that I had to go and check my account to see if I was using the full version or not. At any rate, a good game for $2.99.
B00AIQP9DE|1.0|I have tried a number of times to download this game after my purchase.  It will not download.  I have no idea whether I will like it.  What a WASTE.  There it sits in my cloud.  Going no where.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great game. The story plot is amazing. The puzzles are easy. Hope there are more games like this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is really fun and the thing that I like about is that it is just like the Pc version but the thing I don't really like about it is that at first it is really hard to move but then you get used to it after a while.
B00ABXA1HI|1.0|You can only access computers while your tablet/phone is on the same local network as those computers.  You have to pay an additional subscription fee to access them remotely or outside your home network.  There are plenty of quality free apps for Remote Desktop (RDP) or VNC to access computers within your home or local network already.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Not the best writing, but enjoyed reading it a lot! All that I wanted to happen and waited for, did. On to the next!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a great adventure game. Keeps you going into new places and new quests. I enjoy it! Dark Arcana: the Carnival lets you explore different dimentions. Keeps you entertained and in the right direction as to what needs done next.
0399160450|5.0|Threat Vector was a good read. I could hardly put it down. Anyone who likes the writing of Tom Clancy should read this book.

Cosmopolis is worse than all of the stinkers I have EVER seen.<br /><br />A Fragmented mess filled with very boring dialogue.<br /><br />I assume that an artsy-fartsy movie maker put together this mess in order to appeal to other high-brow types. You have the regular barfbags walking out of this dreck 1/4 of the way through. But the upper-crust, artsy-fartsy types can be above the common serfs and brag about how brilliant this movie is.....\\"Oh, I was stunned at the message and its startling implications\\"...........LMFAO.<br /><br />I am not very smart or creative......but I assume that even a dumwit like me could do better than this stinky STINKER of a movie.<br /><br />  Tickyul

B009MCRHH6|4.0|I really like this game and so does my six year old. We play almost every day since I got it.
B001EYU1VO|1.0|i didnt know that if you didnt use it for a week and a half that the rudder control would stop working and the hatswitch stop working. just a waste of money, and i had to throw it away after many times of trying to fix it....dont buy it...
B008ASLK8A|5.0|I thought after seeing the trailer over and over on TV I wouldn't like this film. the studio heads led me to believe it was a big blockbuster action adventure film like Transformers, so I didn't see this film in the theater. my loss. this was a well acted, perfectly directed adaptation of Sherlock Holmes. I'm a lifelong love of the books and British adaptations to film. do watch, you won't be disappointed.
B00APUYN0I|1.0|My wife and I decided to watch based on the 4.5 star rating. It was about 2 hours too long and just boring. We had a great time joking and trying to recal the last time we watched such a dud.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This book was so unexpectedly amazing. I thought it would be a quirky, cute, love story based on the commercial for the movie, but it was so much more. I can't explain it, you just have to read it and see for yourself:)
B000002U9P|5.0|Tina Turner delivers yet another impeccable album with this 1986 album.  Songs are upbeat, fun, diverse, and offer a variety of pop, rock, and soul.  A must have for all Tina fans!!
B003XDZN8A|5.0|Yet again I'm truly satisfied with my Crocs.  I was worried that the newer styles wouldn't be as comfortable as the &#34;traditional&#34; ones.  These are great.  I have narrow feet and these are a welcome relief.  They run true to size.  Although they may not work as well for wider feet.  Someone mentioned that they rubbed on the inside where the strap joins.  I didn't find mine this way at all.  And the heel strap is perfect for me.
B00A0SKFLG|4.0|This movie had much better acting, story line, action, and actors/actresses than original.  Colin Farrell was good. Kate Beckinsale was remarkable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I recommend this to everyone. Guy or girl. Young or old. It's full of a roller coaster of emotions and nonstop moments where you crave more.
B00632HWOG|2.0|Latest update on this app deleted my contacts! I have not been able to find on here if this is one of many glitches or not. I'm appalled at the lack of 'Help', too. My iPhone app experience has been that a link to development is available and problems can be reported. Have not found that methodology available through Kindle Fire apps at all.  We place these reviews and things come to a dead stop. I've had a Yahoo account since the '90's and will continue to use that long-term e-mail, but with their long-term problems, this may be another reason to look elsewhere.
B000001G6W|5.0|The dissenting reviewers who find Karajan's Beethoven 9th to be too grand and over-polished are hinting at its only vulnerability.  This is an immense performance, huge in scale and overflowing with passion that isn't attached to a control valve.  What some reviewers find dissatisfactory is that Karajan always maintains such a tight grip that there is never a moment where the tension slags enough for us to even catch a quick breath.<br /><br />These complaints are valid, but aren't they better viewed as blessings?  In a masterpiece that represents the height of symphonic ingenuity, firm vision would seem desirable.  And while Karajan isn't flexible, the playing of the Berliners is anything but straightforward.  The feeling of raw Germanic force is thrilling, every minute of it.  And it's unfair to accuse Karajan of lacking sensitivity.  He finds icy beauty in the Adagio and in between some of the most whamming climaxes, he breathes a quick prayer.  The point is that his intensity never leaves, no matter the character he's employing.  It's true that the Wiener Singverein doesn't have nearly the same power as the orchestra in the finale, but I find that to be a minor detraction.<br /><br />In our day it is difficult to find interpreters who grasp the soul and strength of Beethoven.  Some listeners may choose to view Karajan as aloof and cold for his concentration.  I, on the other hand, think his gifts come as a welcome relief from the tepid Beethoven that is common fare today.

B0087JTAKW|5.0|It held my interest all the way through. I also liked it because it was so different from most books I have found.
B004LOMB2Q|2.0|I tried this but found it too cumbersome...not as easy as I would have hoped and perhaps just too many menu commands
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this book was amazing! I chose 5 stars because it kept my attention. It was so heartfelt and beautiful! Made me feel so grateful for all that I have in my life and also gave me insight to live life a little differently. It made me truly appreciate my life!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Loved this story, great writer, very interesting and not at all what I expected.  Good storyline, wonderful characters and I was sad when it ended.

B008FWHGYS|3.0|When you see a powerhouse cast with the likes of Anthony Hopkins, Rachel Weisz, Jude Law, Ben Foster...well, let's just say you expect great things. This movie has so much potential because you understand what the intention is within the first ten minutes of the film. The storyline takes you through a series of slowly interconnecting scenarios, most of which plod through chance meetings and circumstances that could make you think about the interactions we have with others on a daily basis. There is a problem, though. The character development leaves much to be desired and it's possibly intentional, allowing the viewer to connect the dots and draw conclusions as the movie goes along. I'm all for thought-provoking character analysis but it seems like the story attempted to take on too many characters at once, creating a jumbled, incongruent attempt at exploring the impact your decisions have on the lives of others.<br /><br />The storyline is strained with the burden of weaving lives together through a series of decisions people make (and don't make) but the ending is woefully empty - the emptiness comes from knowing that these lives crossed paths and yet never really seemed connected to each other in the first place. Again, possibly intentional and food for thought.  Maybe the most inconsequential interaction triggers a series of life-changing events...but i'm sure we've all seen that movie many times before (Crash...21 Grams...you catch my drift). For instance, Jude Law's character barely encounters a novice hooker in a bar. Does that missed connection lead her down a certain path or does it lead him to question who he is as a husband, a father and a person? Maybe both but you are left wondering why that interaction even mattered in the grand scheme of the film...a couple struggling with the blandness of marriage could have been more compelling, in my opinion. I get the underlying themes (struggling with the Id - our nature, the desires we fight, what makes us moraland good people, blah, blah, blah) but neither the cheating husband nor cheating wife inspire any sympathy at all.  Ben Foster's character, recently released from jail, struggles desperately with demons during a chance encounter with an emotionally wounded woman.  Figuratively speaking, the predator in him seems to back away from the wounded prey. Oddly enough, Foster's character is more of a sympathetic one than that of the haphazard philandering husband played by Jude Law.<br /><br />The viewer starts to understand in short order that every chance meeting sets off a series of events but there is nothing to be said for the impact these chance encounters have on the other person. You can draw your own conclusions but what the movie lacks is a truly compelling story. I recommend it if you have time to kill because it's not one of those movies that makes you wish you had that time back. It just makes you wish the writer tried a little harder to make you care.
B00111YM5G|3.0|Not the best movie ever done, but not the worst either. No exactly what I was expecting. Needs more something.
B004FRX0MY|5.0|Faster, easier, and usually cheaper. Converts to Zune, Windows Media and iTunes easily.  New Computer? No problem. Purchases are stored in the cloud.
B009SIE6AA|4.0|I am a lifelong fan of JT. This CD is terrific festive Christmas! The reason it is a 4 is because it's a little lacking in any kind of spiritual heartbeat... the real meaning of Christmas. Still, I love JT.
B009E3EY38|5.0|Came on time and enjoyed it several times.Thanks its a great disc that even has rehearsal Video which was a bit different.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I loved this game! great graphics and features! I could easiley keep up with the story even when I wasn't paying attention.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|this is the most played game on my kindle fire.. if you love city building games but want one that is less time consuming this is a must download. graphics are beyond entertaining.
B001EBWITA|4.0|Has good special effects.<br /><br />Not one of Keanu Reeves best performances, but the story and other casts made the movie worth watching.
B005LAIH54|5.0|I just got the 2nd movie  to the original &#34;Clash of the Titans&#34; of the original movie &#34;Clash of the Titans&#34; with Harry Hamlin and Lawrence Oliver which was a wonderful movie at its time! Both movies came on time together and in good shape would buy from Amazon and the other company that i got the other clash movies from !
B004VYYA2K|3.0|This was very cute but not very sturdy! It got bent the first day. Top does not stay on very well.
1451648537|5.0|This is more then just the life of Steven Jobs. I defines his vision and creativity.  It is textbook to understanding the true entrepeneur spirit.  It inspires and motivates, and offers tools to assist anyone on their own individual career path.
B0058EBNAO|5.0|This is my favourite and most useful weather app I use everyday. It shows detailed weather information in different formats. Customization is great. Although I only miss asthetic clock widget in this, but no complaints. This is only a suggestion to developer to add one or two beautiful looking clocks widget, and this app is perfect for anyone.
B00799L3OM|5.0|It's my favorite CD/DVD. I have one and purchased it for my daughter who's an aspiring singer/actress who fell in love with it when she watched my DVD. Thanks.
B00AECDDYY|5.0|This game is incredibly addictive. As soon as you beat one level you can't wait to try your strategy on the next. I love this game!

B008FYZIVY|5.0|Love the timely story of the turn of the century.  I watched the entire Christmas vacation, and now I am going to take it to my mom so she can enjoy it as well.
B005CRQ4GU|4.0|Good. I hope that it is a good book. I haven't read it yet. Looking forward to reading this book.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was good but I felt the ending lacking.  Without giving away the ending, it doesn't end like most probably wanted it to. Katniss as a character wasn't as strong as she could have been.  But I didn't write the book. The series was good overall but liked the first two books much better.
B003F1WM2K|5.0|An amazing read for anyone who adores the true to tell saga of a struggling artists passion and their rise to fame.  A ballad of loves purest measure detailed in the intimacy of a lifelong partnership. Mesmerized  and captured by every written word.  Because The Night:)
B00280LYIM|5.0|The best book I've ever read ha he ha he ha he ha he ha he ha he ha ha

B0018J2QB8|5.0|I only use the treadmil to work out. A fast workout means that my viewing material that I'm watching is great. 75 min workout total.<br /><br />Time flies when I'm watching DEXTER. I'm on season 4 now.<br />It's a suspence, comedy and a drama all wrapped up into one!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|It was the right amount of emotion. Best book ever. Sequil please there should be another book because it was awesome. I want to see what his face looks like
B005LAIGLO|4.0|I love a good thief movie and Contraband fits the bill. There's a lot of twists and turns that keeps you interested throughout the entire movie till the end.<br /><br />Contraband looks exceptional on Blu-ray and the dialog is nice and clear unlike a lot of Blu-rays I own.<br /><br />I highly recommend this movie to anyone that loves a good flick!

B004LWZW8S|5.0|It's unfortunate Immortals didn't do that great in the box office because it's a must watch movie. Such a great story and the action is top notch throughout the entire film. I'm definitely proud to have Immortals in my ever growing Blu-ray collection!
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I loved this book it was very interesting and fun paced. I really connected with both characters and their struggles with their emotions. I would recommend this book to a friend no questions asked.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Once you start reading it will be hard to put down .  Very well written. Good story line, easy to keep up with what is happening.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Very interesting plot and storyline. Slow in the middle, but had to finish. Ending was a bit of a surprise.
B004XZR63M|5.0|Gave me lots of new ideas on making money and getting rich. I definitely suggest this if you want to get out of the \\"rat race\\"
B00ARAO1LC|4.0|This was a good thriller and at times, very funny.  It was a hard 'R' and I wonder how it kept from being NC-17 because some of the scenes were sexually graphic.  All in all, I enjoyed the movie.  I liked it better than McConaughey's 'Magic Mike' but for some reason my wife liked 'Magic Mike' better...hmmmmm .... I wonder why....
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved this book as much as the first two! Once again I was very surprised by the end of the book.
B000YHG72E|5.0|Great for the family.  Everyone loves this movie. New and unique...not the same old themes.  This is definitely a movie for our traditional collection.
1609611543|5.0|This book is helping me becoming wheat free.  I am making this a life style not a diet.<br />Need to purchase the Cookbook.
B003HKN52U|4.0|I actually loved the movie, but unfortunately, Vampires do not spend a lot of time in the daylight, so much of the movie was filmed in the dark.  It would have been better if they had chosen better lighting during filming.
B000FC1MOQ|5.0|Product that was received was as advertised and it was received quickly.  I will make purchases from this seller again.
B005LAII12|1.0|Bought this movie because friends said it was the funniest movie they had ever seen. Guess we have different taste in movies.  I didn't even make it a third way through it before I shut it off.  I found it so very crude and gross that it over rode anything funny that could possibly have been in it.  Seller was great...movie was not!

B00A1XOPE8|4.0|I enjoyed this book. This book was Well written. This book had an intriguing plot.  But don't take my word for it...
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|Who ever you are,<br />And if your looking for a game like &quot;SLENDER&quot;<br />This is the app this is the mother load of scares<br />So, Buy the app and don't buy any other slenderman<br />Games ok?
0891419195|5.0|After watching the HBO series The Pacific, I was intrigued by the men who lived through it. Decided to read Sledgehammer's account. I was not disappointed. Those who made the series must have relied heavily on this book because so many details are here. This book is a must read. When you are finished, thank a veteran. There aren't many of the old breed left. The sacrifice for our freedom was not free.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Classic Clancy.  Exciting and though provoking.  How does he do it time and time again.  THis one will not dissapoint!
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Great hidden object game!  Being able to use the &quot;hint&quot; button is a real plus.  FUN to play.  Would recommend!!!
B000OIZUW6|2.0|While I am a big fan of Follett, this was not his finest effort.  The story could have been compelling, but the prose was not up to his standard.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|FINALLY a Facebook app for Kindle Fire instead of the mobile website link!!!! Works great... not sure what other users are complaining about. Hope this app gets frequent updates like the phone app does.
B002NLY0V4|5.0|this was my favorite episode season of all episodes and I plan to download more seasons in the very near future.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a really great, creative game that is actually addicting.  My kids love to play it and you can join in on each others games.  But be careful this causes arguments
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|A great show.  Great humor.  Great band backing Leonard Cohen.  An appreciative audience.  A brilliantly-mastered record.  Classic songs.  What more could you want?
B009B8YZIK|1.0|There's no subtitles- no very hearing impaired friendly. Couldn't find a way to access closed captioning either. Was hoping a refund or a remake of it with subtitles?<br /><br />:(<br />:(
B007KCG7MQ|3.0|I appreciate that Joe Walsh put out a new record.  Very much.  This one takes time to get comfy with.  Great guitar of course.  A nice tribute to his wife, that's for sure....
B007BVOEPI|5.0|I was looking for a series to watch and was torn between this and Downtown Abbey. Im so glad I chose Game of thrones to watch, it is an excellent series1
B003NWS5AO|5.0|Robert Plant, at it again.  A very creative, grass-roots, earthy, bluegrassy, edgy record filled with amazing string work by Buddy Miller and Darrell Scott.
034580404X|5.0|I don't understand everyone's bad reviews but personally it was great!! You may have heard of this book and you should already know what to expect. Writing was great and didn't get boring. It kept me wanting more. Finished the whole trilogy in three days. Couldn't stop reading haha
B002DKGWVQ|5.0|A band that was here and gone well before their time.  Fantastic experimentation with effects and such, along with really good vocals/lyrics/harmonies. This one needs to be in your collection!
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It was ok<br /><br />It was ok because i thought it would be bigger than it was<br />It was very short to me
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put this thrilling, but calming; happy, yet sad; exhilarating book down! I was extremely sad when the book ended but reminded myself the words will forever stick in my mind.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|In,this book I saw everything I was looking and even more I saw words I never even thought or heard of .If anyone asks me for a definition or a good dictionary I would say to go to \\"you should get the New Oxford American dictionary!!!!!!!!!#!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
1400067820|4.0|Let me start by saying that I am a massive Taleb fan.  His writing influences many aspects of my life.<br /><br />I believe all the positive elements of this book have been covered by other reviewers so no need for me to go over old ground.  The whole concept of hormesis is one I have always thought was vitally important.  He has surrounded this concept with a robust (antifragile?) framework which makes perfect sense.<br /><br />However, I have one small issue which I have found troubling.  It is when he calls ADHD and Depression \\"invented illnesses\\".  I know what he is trying to say - that they are overdiagnosed and many cases are simply someone with a negative bias or a kid with some behavioural issues.<br /><br />As someone with impeccable logic (usually), Taleb appears to have done something strange in this particular chapter.  He has spent the first part of the chapter talking about how Semmelweis was ostracized because although he knew that washing hands reduced mortality, he had no theory as to why, which did not satisfy the 'establishment' of the time.  How is this different from genuine cases of ADHD or Depression?  To use ADHD as an example, all the doctors in this field know is that you can have a pathological behaviour pattern and you give them a particular kind of medication (which work on dopamine & noradrenaline) and the kids function like normal kids.  However, for certain quarters of the medical 'establishment' this is not yet acceptable because of no satisfactory 'theory' of why this should be the case.  Same for depression.  There are some people that, without medication, are completely unable to function or enjoy any quality of life.  Again, there is no satisfactory 'theory' as to why this should be the case.  Monoamine hypothesis? Faulty thinking? Diet?  All we know is that for severe depression, drugs can give certain people their life back.  This is no different than high blood pressure or hypercholesterolemia.  People have a right to qualityof life.<br /><br />I think it is irresponsible and logically incorrect to label a whole illness 'invented' because of the minority of cases at the periphery where drugs are overused.<br /><br />I also think there is a slight variation of the very concept Taleb pushes in the Black Swan at work here.  Taleb does not personally suffer depression or have a child who cannot function without ADHD medication.  As someone who is an acolyte of Popper and the problem of induction, I find Taleb's comments regarding Depression & AHDH bizarre and lacking logical rigor.<br /><br />However, this was the only part of the book I took umbrage with.  On the whole, another excellent Taleb book which I will definitely be re-reading at various times in the future again.
1596680296|5.0|I could write epic love poems about how awesome this book is. I took a class on how to knit socks but hated it. It mystified me that so many knitters talk about how great socks are as a fast, easy project.<br /><br />Then, I met Ann's book.<br /><br />She liberated me from the idea that I had to knit socks with tiny little yarn on fussy little needles.<br /><br />With the help of Ann's book, I've knocked out a pair of socks ON MY OWN using chunky yarn on size 8 needles. This allowed me to master how to knit each part of the sock. It's sort of how kids use big red pencils and lined papers when they're learning to write.<br /><br />Even more, it showed common problems, like laddering, and how to fix them.<br /><br />My second sock is coming off the needles tonight. In truth, they'll be slippers because they're too fat for shoes. But they're AWEDOME and i'm proud.<br /><br />What's even more awesome, is that I can't wait too start my next pair on size 4/5 needles!!!!!<br /><br />BUY THIS BOOK NOW!
B003XF1XOQ|2.0|Unexpected twists and turns. I enjoyed it for what it was: an easy read with an interesting story but nothing stellar on the literary side.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I like this first album from Phillip Phillips, but it's not mind-blowing. The songs are catchy and fun to listen to. At times he sounds like Dave Matthews (Tell Me a Story; Get Up Get Down), other times a little like Tim McGraw (Can't Go Wrong), but for the most part he has his own original sound. His hit Home is one of the best songs on here.
B008K8VDPU|5.0|I like pianist the finger tap piano because. u get all the keys and u can switch insterments i love this game and it is very fun to use.
B008DM4OTA|4.0|This is a great game for kids.  The objective is to get the patient from the elevator, to the waiting room, on to the exam room, diagnosed, treated, and discharged.  You also have the task of cleaning up the hospital room after treatment.  This is a great game for 3-7 year olds, but is limited in the number of &#34;diseases&#34; to be cured.  So it becomes repetitive very quickly.  You can mend ribs, remove articles from the belly, put drops in eyes, an injection in the butt (along with a band-aid, and a few other ailments.  Its cute, and will keep a child busy for about 20 minutes.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This is an interesting book to escape into. You begin to feel as though you are one of the characters in the book and begin relating to their lives. We have know people like these in our own lives. Nice change of pace.
B00AA0TJO8|5.0|This is a really cool game for kids.  The stick man that you draw is the one that walks around the screen.  Also, you are asked to draw tools to help you solve problems throughout the game.  This really makes kids think!  Highly recommended.
B00942S4OY|5.0|Being the latest 1D cd, every fan will love it! It has great music, perfect for obsessed fans (like me)! I listen to this alllllll the time. There were no problems with shipping; it arrived fairly quickly.It was in perfect condition, and has beautiful music. If you are the teeniest bit interested in one direction, you absolutely HAVE to get this cd!
B005LAIHZY|2.0|What you seen in the trailer is basically the first several minutes of the movie. I thought the movie would be about a strong independent woman like the movie Tangled but it's not. The final battle is not even between the main character and the bad guy. Also the movie was very scary for my 5  year old
B009VLX8FS|5.0|I donwloaded this for my 6 year old granddaughter, she is a huge fan of Taylor Swift.  It's a great album.
B009NW9QE2|5.0|This movie is a favorite pick-me-up movie. Jack Black is adorable and so romantic, Jude Law is heart wrenching and handsome. The couples are perfect, the settings of both houses--LA dream mansion to UK country cottages-perfect as we all dream to experience both (as well as both relationships). If you love romance you must see it again and again!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Cheap! I have never been a fan of these kinds of games but this brought the child in me back to life. The gameplay is very entertaining. One of the best of the year.
B003QNXPUK|4.0|I ordered the maximum coverage iPhone 4/4s version shield, brand new, and when I got it in the mail, it showed the correct picture, and I cut the seal... It was brand new ... And opened the box the wrong shield was inside?? The back camera hole shape was different than the picture on the box, and the side antenna pieces were wrong? In the picture it shows they have edges to go around the buttons but mine were straight and didnt reach the buttons? They're went even the right amount of pieces...the paper they were on had the logo all over it so it wasn't replaced with a cheasier shield.... Idk what happened or if it's just a false advertisement on the box...?
B0088P2A7A|5.0|All I have to do is think of a question to get an answer in as many seconds. Google is great but most times this is even better.
B004SJ3BCI|3.0|I love this game but still waiting for updates for my Kindle Fire.  It would be great if Amazon would be a little faster with their update apps. Still no Surf and Turf update...I may have to go to Google play.
B008AK8FHM|1.0|I am a physician who has seen life and death from both sides. My belief in the afterlife is confirmed daily when I see the miracles of life through the complexity of our human selves. Having read nearly everything out there on near death experience I am convinced this dimension we are in is not the only one we will ever experience. Einstein postulated at least eleven dimensions and our human spirits are destined for them all. Dr. Alexander, however, did not convince me that his experience was an NDE. His book read like a rambling of someone on LSD. His Ivy League pomposity displayed his arrogance in thinking he is the only one who ever discovered the beauty of Einstein's genius. I feel for what he went through, but in this case his NDE read like psychobabble. I too was Ivy League trained. He professes with many words without making any cogent points like too many lofty professors. Spend your money elsewhere.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|the only time i will stop playing is when i cant beat the leavel thats how cool it is get it
0425263908|5.0|I ordered this book for Roopali (my lovely wife). She liked the cover and on reading she found it very interesting.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another Bosch page turner.  Keeps interest with added emotion of his personal life with his daughter and professional life.  Great read.
B009DJB9HC|5.0|Great Album... Rocks. Would Love to see a tour. Hope they make more music in the future. No brainer here.
B002RI9SC4|2.0|Boring, boring, boring.<br />Teenager book. Even werewolf en vampire teenagers are boring. Skip it. Can't believe they made movies out of this. Can't  think  of less inspiring books for that.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I guess we all keep hoping for the fun and suspense of Grisham's first books. I feel that he has sort of retired, but hasn't quite recognized it. This book was a little flat and a little predictable.
B005UBNKWO|5.0|This is a very nice cpu i just installed it yesterday and no problems yet. i love the copper heat pipes on the heat sink looks sweet!!!! i might over clock... but we will see.
B0095XPZBC|4.0|As good as season one, though it is noticeable that some of the HD'ifing could have been done better in some episodes. and it like season 1 was in 4:3 display. 16:9 come on!! everyone has an HD thats widescreen. oh well still love it
B004PYDBVM|4.0|I can recommend this book to anyone who want to know more about the life in North Korea, life in a work camp (awful but still not the worst of them) and the almost impossible situation of trying to flee this country also known as the \\"Hermit Kingdom\\"
B003TSEEDY|4.0|The book was good however I think they should have a recommendation age on it so the reader will be a little more prepared to how DETAILED some things are<br /><br />Never the less, a really good book
B008FPOIT6|4.0|A friend recommended this book to me, and I had some money to blow, so I thought I'd pick it up. Overall, I really enjoyed the mixture of fantasy, realism, and geek culture. I thought some of the portions with Google were slightly far-fetched, but it certainly didn't ruin the story.
1452101248|5.0|This book has theoat interesting and delicious recipes. I have made several things and all of them have been awesome. I would highly recommend this book to all vegetarians.
B000YHG72E|5.0|It's a modern Christmas classic, a live action Rudolph the Red nosed reindeer.  And laugh out loud funny even after repeated viewings.
B002VISN9E|5.0|This was one of my favorite books from when I was a young teen, to reread it now with my kids just made me fall in love with it all over again. It's nice to have a story the kids love just as much as I do. This is the case with Roald Dahl's Matilda.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|LOVE THIS SHOW!  I'm not usually into \\"cop shows\\" at all, but this one is awesome.  Equal parts funny, interesting mystery, charm, and great characters.  If you still love Nathan Fillion from Firefly, give this one a chance, you will love it!
B002VISNLC|4.0|Loved the movie as a kid and I love the story even more. This is a fun story full of danger, laughter and adventure with great characters. It was is a great story that I was able to share with my kids and my neice and nefew.
B007ZD17XO|4.0|entertaining game- good graphics. could use better instructions for the small games. overall fairly good game.  worth the dollar cost!
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|Fun and entertaining!!  Kids and adults both will enjoy this movie.  This is the second time we have seen it and we really enjoyed it!
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|I could hardly put The Girl Who Kicked The Hornet's Nest down. All three books in Larsson's trilogy are top notch...detailed, interesting, suspenseful and provided much entertainment. I was fascinated by how much I liked the main character, Lisbeth. I suspect that had I meet such an individual in passing in real life I'd not have taken a liking, but from a reader's point of view it can not be helped to have anything but compassion and respect for her. I'm happy I can finally watch the movies!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Loved it!  A refreshing change of pace for King fans.  If you enjoy time travel fiction this is a great choice
1603427244|4.0|This book gives me the tools to start and finish projects in an appropriate way - so many patterns just say &#34;cast on (or bind off) X number of stitches&#34;, with no advice as to which way would suit best. I like the lay flat lay-out as well. My only reservation is I would like to have it as an e-book on my iPad, but maybe that will come down the track...
B0042816YK|5.0|I wanted to purchase this book, but at a reasonable price.  It is gratifying to know that I can purchase a paperback book in very good condition with Amazon for such a low price.  And the shipping & handling price is good too.  Thank you!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Great book, total page turner. Read from start to finish in a matter of hours. Will definitely be reading more by Colleen Hoover.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|It is a very addicting book. I will read the other hoping to be as satisfied. Loved it very much.
B009FZFONO|5.0|I love to watch this show and would recommend it!  The show has plenty of drama and turns throughout the  season.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I've never played a game like this and thoroughly enjoyed it! Some levels took several tries, but it wasn't impossible. I only wish there more levels!
B00AFCEIB0|2.0|Amazon needs to improve this application.  the interface and resolution to this app is unacceptable.  shame on you Amazon for offering this to your loyal consumers .
B0015DROBO|2.0|The characters and flow made this very difficult to read. Unlike books you can't wait to pick up again, this left me trying to remember what had happened in previous chapters. With all the hype related to this book I was disappointed.
B008FYZIVY|5.0|We liked the UK version with no problems viewing in our U.S. DVD player.  Shipped very quickly.  Highly recommended series.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Enjoyed reading this book from beginning to end. I will spare you the details and a brief summary... just buy and read it, you won't regret it!
B004G600A4|5.0|Tangled was a typical Disney movie that showed the best use of today's digital graphic illustration. I repeat: Tangled was a typical Disney movie that showed the best use of today's digital graphic illustration.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love it I would play it24 7 if I could this thing is so awesome I was not sure if I would like it at first but now  I have played it I have beaten a lot of games and gotten a lot of money fake of coures
