0061122416|5.0|I've read and reread this book a few times, especially when I feel at a crossroads in life. I would gift this book for anyone who is graduating high school or college and unsure about what their next steps are. In fact, I recommend this book for anyone who feels lost and unsure about what the next step is in life.<br /><br />I even got the animated book [[ASIN:0062024329 The Alchemist: A Graphic Novel]] that was published a few years back. It was so nice to read both versions, the printed one and the graphic one. This is a treasure in my library.<br /><br />Another book I love for soul-searching purposes is [[ASIN:0967469783 The Buddha in Your Mirror: Practical Buddhism and the Search for Self]]. It's so practical and the philosophy is so deep. Happy journeying!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Downton Abbey is probably the best thing we have seen on TV in so very long. We love it, so glad to have the DVDs
B000WC3A0S|5.0|I got this for my son as a present as he enjoys Rocky's movies.  Thank you the DVD's were perfect.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is the best ever it keeps me chilled and kind of refreshes the mind I feel like it is an obligation for me to play it everyday because it is really fun :)<br /><br />===========================================================<br /><br />THIS REVIEW WAS WRITTEN BY THE PERSON WHO STOLE MY KINDLE FIRE.

B0000AYJXR|5.0|My nephew had this and it was not working and that's why i replaced it for him with this one.  He loves this dvd and he enjoys the movie.  Thank you.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|The series is a fascinating tale that is forever changing so one can never assume that star characters will carry through the entire run.  It is entertaining, interesting, just enough fantasy to keep it realistic.  I do not have HBO, I got hooked by a co-worker who purchased season 1.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|If you love horses you've got to get it, it needs trail riding, breeding and you should be able to see them in their stables
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I've only started playing and so far, I like what I see.  Mini-games could have more challenge, but we'll see.  I just might purchase to complete game.
B007N85POS|5.0|gave it 5 stars because it is very entertaining, exciting and just a fun game to play. I would definitely  suggest it to a friend!
B0017SWSCW|5.0|As always when reading one of Mr. Archers wonderful books could not put the book down.  Have read a quite a few of his books and have enjoyed all of them .
B0050DIWFC|4.0|This novel is a real page turner. I could not put the book down. Interesting perspective on mom and dad's way of handling crisis situations.  This novel sent chills up my spine.....I am a mother.
0061801313|5.0|Pretty Little Liars fans must love this i have had this set for around 5 years and it is still perfect. The box it came in is still intact and the books were made to perfection and the books are just fantastic, mysterious and just great!
B008IJTFYW|5.0|I was a little concerned at first as I didn't notice the sleep timer. The second evening I didn't have to run it all night. Lol.<br />I like the way you can select which sounds are most pleasing.<br />Nice, useful app!!
B00B4804MQ|5.0|This movie made me decide to start watching the fast and furious movies, and I started to become a Fast and Furious fan and wanted to watch more because of this movie.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|Keeps me entertained for hours. I just want to try to beat my own score over and over again. I just wish they had more levels.
B00B8WXG9G|3.0|Thats me, I guess! haha! The CD is good, good quality. I guess I was just being nostalgic. Paul Anka was a little before my time, but I thought with the duets it would liven him up. And it does. I'm not sorry I bought it, just not loving it.
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|I loved this movie because the intensity and reality. Naomi Watts acting is outstanding. I tried not to cry, but. as the title says, it was impossible.
B0094MFITS|4.0|I like Tom Selleck and this was a good story, easy to watch. No real violence like some or a lot of the movies that are out now.
1878424319|5.0|This is a wonderful gift for anyone, but we gave it to several high school graduates. There is so much wisdom packed into such a simple book.
B001SKB1Y0|3.0|I liked it but my husband would not have.  I was in the mood for some fun pretense and this was a cute get-away.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|This game is a wonderful time waster. If k e needs to go numb for an hour to unwind then this is th he game.
B003RV43X4|4.0|What a movie. I really enjoyed it. Their was a lot of different battles, with different creatures. All of the right people was picked for this movie. It turned out good.
B004V71CYQ|5.0|In 1982, when I was just 16 years old, I was one of the 16 TRON Tournament finalists who played the final TRON rounds in New York's Madison Square Garden. I know; big deal. But it is because of this that this movie will always have a special place in my heart, and it still conjures good memories with each viewing all these years later.<br /><br />My appreciation for the movie is also bolstered since I sat in the screening room - watching the very first public viewing of the movie ever with the other tournament contestants - with the movie's actors just a few feet away. Jeff Bridges (Flynn/Clu), Bruce Boxleitner (Bradley/Tron), David Warner (Dillinger/Sark/MCP) and Cindy Morgan (Lora/Yori) and several others - they were all there. And the special effects and story were mind blowing - they were nothing like I, nor anyone else, had ever seen.<br /><br />Sure, the movie definitely has its shortcomings by today's standards, and it was not the financial hit Disney wanted - and needed. Perhaps worst of all, it really was the special effects that carried the movie. The acting and story were both good, but no one understood them. I still have dozens of newspaper clippings panning the movie's story line because of this, and probably just as many predicting Disney's financial demise for investing so heavily in such an untested story line and technological approach.<br /><br />Basically, if you were an adult in 1982, you probably didn't like the movie. If you were a tech-savvy kid, it was the best movie ever - at least it was to me at the time - and a sign of things to come.<br /><br />By why was that? Remember, the movie was full of terms like \\"bits\\" and \\"bytes\\" and \\"CPU\\" which meant very little to most of the people walking the planet at the time. But we hear them all the time now. And it didn't help that several of the actors were playing dual roles with alter ego names like \\"Tron\\", \\"Clu\\" and \\"Sark\\". Being a young video game player then, I understood the terminology and concept, but my parents, who were about 40 years old then, didn't get it at all. It broke my heart when my dad stood up when the lights came on and said he hated it. Many of the movie's own investors hated it, too, probably for the same reason.<br /><br />But technological movies and items are de rigueur these days, and I think that makes this story easier to understand in the contemporary world.<br /><br />With all that said, the movie is an '80s time capsule to be appreciated now like \\"Back to the Future\\", \\"Fast Times at Ridgemont High\\", \\"Ferris Buellers Day Off\\", etc. Don't take it too seriously; just enjoy it for all of its Reagan Era goodness.
B0019I6WDG|5.0|I am a man and I love this movie. I laughed a lot and really just enjoyed Juno. I could watch It again, right now. It is that good. I can not think of one bad thing about this movie. Also, the ending is good.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|JUST AS BAD AS THE WEATHER CHANNEL.  THEY SHOULD PAY US TO DOWNLOAD IT.  I WILL BE REMOVING IT. WEATHER BUG HAS ALL THE INFO YOU NEED WITHOUT THE INFO BUBBLES?????  What do you need those foe.  I JUST WANT WEATHER.
B008602KQI|4.0|though this movie takes liberties with the story line from the book, it is a great movie to watch with an amazingly talented Jennifer Lawerence.  the special effects were spot on with the descriptions from the book.  thoroughly enjoyed how quickly the movie progressed.  i'm looking forward to the follow up.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is addictive,fun and it's something to do. The Beijing Subway Surfers is off the hook!!! It has amother cool power up that I think you guys would like. So just get Subway Surfers all of them if you can!!! :)
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this. More rooms, please! I enjoyed  the progression, made me use my mind. Keep them coming. I am hooked on this game.
B0091REZMW|2.0|I liked the game at first but then you have to use real money to continue the game. I would have enjoyed it more if it didn't require that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|4 all u people who read the the 1 star reviews,  dont listen to them, there just haters,  oh the reason y i love this game is because its fun, it has graphics that are cute for is kids or teens, its addictive in a good fun way, it dose not ERASE ur stuff and its better then temple run!!! btw haters dont be hate n an awesome game, unlike u. :) get it its an awesome game
B009NQZVKG|2.0|Given the last Sigma Force book, the end of the long fight with the Guild, this book seems a bit of a let down.  While I've yet to finish this book, the story line seems weak and the nefarious characters a bit like coming out of a B-movie.  In playing out the scene of the blue wolf character and the attacks at the steppes was a disappointing part.  I have a hard time finishing the book as I lost enthusiasm for it.  I hope Rollins starts a Sigma Force series with a deep rooted adversary like they had with the Guild that existed throughout the last series.
B006ZAZ31U|4.0|Love the openness and honesty that reveals how God works in and through our lives.  I would recommend this book to everyone.
B00D6BN9NK|3.0|These are getting old, but I wasn't looking for a plot, just some action to the night, and on that front it delivers. Even the humor level is worse in this one though.
B0042TV4IW|3.0|I was hooked after the first two or three shows. I watched this until seasons end, and waited anxiously to begin season two. What I found was the same story lines over and over. The same disappointments over and over, with the exact same characters.<br /><br />I was also tired of seeing the Christian characters played as WAYYYYY over the top, and the Pagan as wise, calm and all knowing. It got old fast! I watched a little of season three, finding the exact same story line AGAIN! UGH I just couldn't watch anymore.
B0094LUH4A|5.0|All time favorite movie.<br />Barbra and Robert together are the perfect<br />Match on screen....<br />Get the popcorn,  let it take you away....
159463176X|5.0|Poignant, relevant, sad, and beautifully plotted, this was a story for our times. Oh Afghanistan! Hosseini sings the songs of the homeland.
B0094M2ODQ|5.0|This is a movie about love and wanting to be loved<br />And finally finding it.....<br />Great ending, loved every moment....
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This was a well written novel. Enjoy how the author kept you engrossed in story. I was surprised at ending. Will make a point to read others by William Landay.
B00867GJYK|5.0|Looks like some people are having issues with their blu-ray player not playing the movie. UPDATE BLU-RAY PLAYER FIRMWARE if that dont work its not the movies fault its your CRAPPY BLU-RAY PLAYER get a new one.
B00CJGP116|5.0|I love this CD I would recommend Mark Anthony is one of the time you will not regret buying this  CD by now you
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game never gets old. All the different levels and challenges it  much better than temple run and subway surfers.
B00DYTKKGI|5.0|I love it. It is fun and a cool app for kids. It keeps you busy  cool game. You should get it  plus. It's free
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|Don't use Facebook, etc, so I can't advance through the missions without purchasing tokens....  other then that, really enjoy it!
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|This game is so much fun. I recommend it for all ages. It's like a leprechaun Mario. This game is totally addicting
B00BVMXBDO|5.0|Just when you think this story can't get anymore twisted, (in a good way)it does.  You've really got to pay attention to this one, there are many characters and all have a pivotal part.......just when you get comfortable with your theories, you'll change them, good acting especially by the lead, don't get discouraged by the 3 disc length it moves really fast and keeps you engaged.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This game is cute love it love the houses for the animals and has all the people from the movie
0446343129|5.0|While the book is old, the logic and science is still sound. Also, as a history nerd, this provides a huge section on the social and cultural history of sugar. Overall a great read, and well worth investigating if you have any issues with mood swings/ depression, etc. I cut out all sugar (except sugar naturally found in fruit) and artificial sweetener and literally within days saw a drastic improvement in my moodiness.
B005HEDIHG|5.0|We watched these as a family, in order, so that the younger members of our household would understand the foundations of the Trek universe. We all laughed at the cheesy sets and the sometimes heavyhanded treatment that Roddenberry gave to the scripts, but the vast majority of shows gave us a lot to think about. In light of the period when they were first broadcast,they were quite courageous in their views on war, nationalism, money, overpopulation and so many more. That the shows were made with such a small budget is especially admirable.
B004Q3SGWG|4.0|I had low expectations for this movie- it seemed like too simple of a story to tell in a movie format, and seemed rather boring and gory- guy falls in hole, guy waits for a few days stuck, guy deliriously cuts arm off and survives. They did a good job extending this into an actually entertaining movie that wasn't nearly as graphic as I thought it would be.
B00DGNOMB6|3.0|It kept gapping and I wasn't sure what was happening...kept saying network problems so i had to watch parts of the movie over and over.  Would probably rate the movie higher if I got to watch it all in one sitting without interruptions...
B0089OBLDO|1.0|complete waste of money . it worked with the ps2 comtroller . needs to specify compatability in description. requires xbox 360 wired controller , srk forums states that it has input lag
0812993845|3.0|I love Greece so much that it kills me with every year that I stay away.  So what's not to love about combining one of my favorite authors and one of my favorite locations?  I have to say that the premise was all so very promising, with the backdrop of a Greek island, an old flame, and the comedy of a sabotaged wedding night, but somehow it just ended up being a bit tiring.<br /><br />Lottie was the single gal who desperately wanted her boyfriend to propose, and when he didn't, ran back to an old flame.  It made me cringe.<br /><br />Fliss had the flaky ex-husband who really couldn't be flakier, who you were dying to have meet someone fantastic.  She had me cheering her on, but she had this flaky single sister named Lottie, who made me cringe.  Poor Fliss.<br /><br />Okay, I get that being disappointed repeatedly can make people do crazy things, but Lottie just made herself look beyond insecure and and unaware.  Her old flame was way too convenient, and holding off on sex for the wedding night (big spoiler there--see the title) which was just the universe telling them both that they were running off to marry one another out of desperation.<br /><br />I REALLY wanted to like this novel.  It had its fun moments.  It had its sweet moments.  But overall, it just wore me out.  Perhaps Kinsella should have backed off on the old flame \\"comedy\\" bit in the story and just let Lottie mourn the loss of her boyfriend, and let her go off to Ikonos on her own?  I don't know, but everything wore me out and made it difficult for me to care.  I liked Fliss, but I had even lost interest there in the end.<br /><br />Overall, I would still recommend it because it's a Sophie Kinsella novel, but it's not one of my favorites of her stand alone novels.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|SUCH an addicting series and I don't usually get attatched to series to easily. So many different elements but they were all tied together so perfectly. Ugh! I just wish I didn't watch the whole series in a week!
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|Great Movie, This is like Action, Romance, and Comedy all in one freaking movie. I liked it so much, that I had to buy the book and I read it all in three hours. The book is even better than the movie.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|it makes a good dope scope too search for keys shoes clothes especially Wye your trying to make a quick escape
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is probably, one of the best movies I've seen my entire life. Besides Nemo at least. This movie will show you what it's like to be a troubled teen and being a new freshman in high school. It's also a different movie because it takes place in the early 90's, and all the teens were giving each other mixed tapes. Please a note parent, this movie does contain profanity, use of drugs and alcohol, and some sexual references. And this is coming from a tween!
B009NG1Q96|4.0|I disappointed this isn't the last book and that I will have to wait for another, but the waiting is done happily for  the most part. I just wish.  Would start picking out book threadbare completely finished.
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|its a fun game without all the bugs. I understand its a new game and they're still working out some buggs but the game glitches and crashes constently. it gets very laggy at times but when it works its great. hope u fix all of the bugs
B008Y2FRFO|4.0|Good game if your board. Not full of commercials like most free games either. I love it and it's good for all ages too.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|Great book. Perfect length to occupy a few nights reading before bed. A little whimsy that had me dreaming of the impossible after I put it down.
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|I watched Yossi and Jagger first and trust me if you want to watch this you HAVE to watch that first.  I was at first hesitant to see this film cause I loved the first one but knowing there was a sequel I had to.  His overwhelming depression screamed through the screen.  Along with some heartbreak and sadness this film becomes a story of hope and love.  Great film!!!!<br /><br />****WATCH YOSSI AND JAGGER FIRST NO EXCEPTIONS
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Those is my favorite game. It is so, so, so, so, so so, amazing!!! I can't believe it is free though. I would've made it at least 99&cent;.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Probably one of the most relevant things I've ever read in my entire life. Highly recommended a great read :)
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game is a very addictive way to pass some time when youre bored. I play it on the Kindle Fire and it looks and plays very well.
B00AK57N00|2.0|i played it about 3 times and it was not worth it at all.  you don't jump, to device does it for you...the only thing you do is tell it when to let you down so you hit the target<br /><br />over all it wasn't fun i would not get it, i tried to return it and it did not work
B000002L68|5.0|Prince is a genius, and this groups of songs proves it.<br /><br />Either you get him, or you don't.<br /><br />I'm grateful I had the chance to be young when this record was released. I remember the first time I heard \\"When Doves Cry\\" on the radio. It  was one of those beautiful momets in life a person never forgets. I imagine people in Paris hearing it, a child in Nigeria hearing it, a person drinking a beer in a bar in Malaysia hearing this song.<br /><br />This is art.<br /><br />This is genius.
B00DYTKKGI|1.0|i did not like it because it was boring and half of the tools you need you have to pay for...i just deleted it from my kindle.  Don't get it because it just takes up space
B00004U8P9|5.0|Perfect for any movie night to re-live going to the mid night movie showing or have a md night movie night at your house. Love the extra's, commentary and live video. Anyone who hads ever wanted to rock the Magenta or Columbia look because they were a little too stressed to try to be Janet at a pasrty.... this is for you!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|A spellbinding read, showing meticulous research and editing. The authors turn a one-time incident into a fascinating examination of the proponents lives and motivations. Also provides a fresh look at the German Air Force in the last year of WWII
B000068FWC|5.0|Ok.maybe not. Don't, however, judge this album by its cover. I grew up outside the US and I had never heard any Supertramp until I heard the title song. It really opened my eyes. I was more of a hard rock (the usual suspects....AC/DC. KISS. Zeppelin, Sabbath, etc.) All of a sudden I am hearing these very distinctive, original voices, Davies and Hodgson, and their powerful, soaring harmonies. DAMN!!! The lyrics are at times silly and/or irreverent, but the ideas they express are not. It takes a lot of talent to deal with serious topics in a fun way, and Supertramp are masters of it. You can sing along or think about what they are saying and have a blast. This one of the few albums I have heard where I NEVER skip a song. It is a short but honorable list, and Supertramp actually has 3 albums on it...&#34;Breakfast in America&#34;. &#34;Even in the Quietest Moments&#34; and &#34;Live in Paris&#34;, so now you have somewhere to go if you fall for Supertramp the way I did. Cheers!
B0051MKNV8|2.0|Let my 14 year old watch this and had to stop it before we got to the end - way too bloody and violent for only being rated PG-13.  Yikes, cover your eyes!
B000FCK8ZK|4.0|Couldn't put it down.  Watched the prime time show and would agree, with other reviewers.  I liked the show characters a little better.
B0031YJFCQ|1.0|Loved the first of the trilogy, liked the second, and hated the third. I recommend reading the first one as a standalone novel and end it there. Second and third are really one story arc with weak payoff so don't even start.
B0090SI582|4.0|What's good: First, the three lead characters: Tao Okamoto, Rila Fukushima, and of course Hugh Jackman. Okamato projects a regal elegance, only reinforced by her flawless features. Fukushima's intense physical style, coupled with a unique and unmistakable face, give her a commanding and somewhat eerie presence. And Jackman, of course, jacked up for the role, has made it impossible for anyone else, ever, to play Wolverine. I'm not throwing stones at any of the other sigbificant characters, but the movie centered on these three. Without any one, it would have been a different flick.<br /><br />What else: Effects, of course, and action, action, action. That top-of-the-train chase scene has been done again and again since the dawn of cinema, but never with such split-second timing, intense physics, and knuckle-gnawing suspense. And, there's the chance for some real personal exploration, when Wolverine discovers that he's more mortal than he thought.<br /><br />What's not: He mostly just shrugs off that chance for a personality-building moment and re-enters the fray, but with more injuries and limping. We all know that Wolverine can take a hit with the best of them, but a few passages took that \\"pain is the feeling of weakness leaving your body\\" thing past any sane boundary. But hey, this is a comic movie, so excessive sanity would not be a virtue.<br /><br />Good fun, great entertainment, middling-to-slight personal drama - just what you came for.<br /><br />-- wiredweird
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Super fun game! Minions running around collecting bananas has never been so much fun! Shhh don't tell anyone but playing it during class makes the time go by a bit faster!
B000WYCF6Q|4.0|I bought this mirror to be able to keep my eye on my dog while in the bike trailer.  While the mirror is not very clear, I am able to check that my dog is still in the trailer.  I mounted the mirror at the top of my bar end.  The mirror is convenient since it can be mounted anywhere, and the mirror angle is adjustable.  It is easy to mount and unmount with the strap.  I appreciate the compact size, it doesn't stick out like a sore thumb.
B009WUBERW|3.0|Mindless action entertainment, mostly made enjoyable by the casting and in-jokes from action movie stars.  You know what to expect, and they add new cameos.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Was hooked from the first episode. Such a fan. The ensemble cast is so terrific, you actually feel like you're living at Downton.
B006INDGFE|4.0|Don't look for innovation, but if like the formula and want the entertainment, it's worth it.  Still amusing even if the structure is a carbon copy.
B004VMVTNU|5.0|This app does exactly what an alarm app should be and then some. I happened to catch it as a free app of the day, but I would have no problem paying for this app.
B0089LOG02|4.0|This was a very interesting book,especially because I was unaware of this important, historical event which took place over many years and involved hundreds of orphaned children..  The author's fictional tale prompted me  to research the actual history of the placing of orphaned children of all ages in homes where they were often used for labor.  Great read.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I am so glad I was able to find out about Suits! Love me some Harvey! This is one of the top shows on TV, hands down. Strongly recommend it.
B0055S348W|2.0|Paid $13 for this and cannot figure out how to use it on my Kindle.  Have managed to print only one page.  Directions need to be improved.
0385349947|5.0|Some readers might say, Nothing new, I could have written that book. I say to them, Did you? No. But Sandberg did. And yet it was not easy. In fact it was scary. Her words,\\"Writing this book is what I would do if I weren't afraid.\\"<br /><br />Sure, I am the COO of exactly nada...and yet I felt a kinship with Sandberg from the first chapter as she described herself as a girl being called \\"bossy\\" and knowing, even as a young child, that it was not a compliment.<br /><br />Most underlined chapters for me: Sit at the Table, Let's Start Talking About It and Working Together Towards Equality.<br /><br />A few quotes that inspired, angered (as in, that is so true and it makes me so mad) or made me think:<br /><br />\\"Men can comfortably claim credit for what they do as long as they don't veer into arrogance. For women, taking credit comes at a real social and professional cost.\\"<br /><br />\\"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.\\" -Sandberg quoting Madeleine Albright.<br /><br />\\"I hope you find true meaning, contentment, and passion in your life. I hope you navigate the difficult times and come out with greater strength and resolve. I hope you find whatever balance you seek with your eyes wide open. And I hope that you - yes, you - have the ambition to lean in to your career and run the world. Because the world needs you to change it.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg finishes strong. On the last page she writes, \\"In the future, there will be no female leaders. There will just be leaders.\\" Hear hear.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Even though this game is a couple years old now, it is still  just as fun to play and revisit. The levels are challenging, the graphics are crisp,and most importantly it is a ton of fun. Wonderful!
B00C1BV9Z6|2.0|Jurassic Park is a classic film, hands down. Amazon's sneaky way of getting out of accountability for their Prime Instant Video service is messed up, for lack of better words.<br />After realizing the convenience of renting an HD film like this, I thought my baby cousins were in for a treat. One out of the three had never seen or heard of the movie. My Prime account allowed me to select the HD version. It then proceeded to restrict me from playing that version while still charging the higher fee. The software detected that I was playing the movie from a PC. With no explanation I was not able to stream HD from my computer. Then after pulling up the standard version I plugged my hdmi cord into the TV so that these three kids can enjoy the movie. I got a message that the \\"device is not HDCP compliant.\\" All this arose from the remotes gone missing; we had the DVD but could not play it because the \\"select\\" button was not on the front of the player. Finally I played it through the PC; by then it was too late for everybody to stay up to watch this wonderful film. The four dollars (3.99) is gone and there's no way to refund request nor is there any troubleshooting about failed streaming video. Lost three stars for that one.
B000VWSINI|5.0|Eminem is one of the best rappers ever, and this is one of his best albums. Perfect for warming up for a workout.
B009NFHF0Q|3.0|The magic of this story did not grasp me until the final chapter. I suppose there are layers or elements I may have missed. Gaiman did a fine weaving this tale, but left me wanting something fuller and richer.
B001UTW7QU|3.0|For starters, you can compare this with Grimm [whose characters are much more appealing and whose international  conspiracy theory is much more refreshing] or, historically, with X Files [whose writing was very snappy] or even with Twin Peaks [which was so over-the-top as to make you hang onto every word].<br /><br />In that world, Fringe is, well, &#34;just OK&#34;.  Despite the zany adventures of the heroine, her character is hard to get into, and I'd guess at least 20% of her screen time is spent looking pensively at someone else who is speaking.  The is-he-or-isn't-he-dead boyfriend seems to serve little purpose at this point.  The FBI sidekick is underutilized and eminently colorless.  The stone-faced boss jumps from friendly and supportive to being a real dick with no apparent plot reason.  The loopy scientist dad is gratuitously weird, not appealingly weird.  The son is a crazy foil character, a blend between a Greek chorus and a supporting character like Pancho from the Cisco Kid.<br /><br />A lot of the plots border on the idiotic.  Now, understand that this is spoken in the context of Grimm, X FIles, and Twin Peaks.  So I do not mean &#34;loopy&#34; or &#34;zany&#34; or &#34;fantastical&#34;.  I actually mean &#34;idiotic&#34;, and that is not a compliment.  The reasons are myriad and small, but the writing could be VASTLY improved.<br /><br />Nobody expects the science in this to be spot-on [like the Big Bang Theory] or even cohesive [like the X Files].  But, really, folks, the &#34;science&#34; in this is right out of the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers.  Compared with a lot of recent offerings [even CSI, for heaven's sake], it's unadulterated crap.  The intro says it all... &#34;Dark Matter&#34; &#34;Psychokinesis&#34; &#34;Teleportation&#34; &#34;Artificial Intelligence&#34; &#34;Nanotechnology&#34;.  That's a bit like saying &#34;The Hillside Strangler&#34; &#34;The Green River Killer&#34; &#34;The Big Bad Wolf&#34; &#34;Donald  Duck&#34;.  believe it or not, there actually ARE viewers who know babies don't come from under green leaves and that airplanes don't fly on the wings of fairies.  Again, I am not comparing this to a recent issue of Journal of the American Chemical Society - just to a recent episode of CSI Miami or House.  The science is so bad, I find it distracting to watch.  And the interplay between the scientist and his son simply rubs it in - like nettles on a sunburn.<br /><br />I hope it improves as we move past Episode 9 of the First season..  My sister's husband was the DOP on several episodes in Years 3 and 4.  I'd not gotten time to watch till now, but I hope they threw him some good material.  For the record, he's a friggin' genius with a camera, and I'd hate to see his talents unmatched by the writing.

B0097C8XL0|3.0|I have not play this game, I bought it for my grandkids and they did not play with it for very long. They do like it but, at their age, they are not very good at giving feedback.
B00846REIS|5.0|This is an awesome series & I can't wait for the next one to come out.  I've read the entire series & will reread before the next one is out.
B00D6B4PUG|4.0|I found it very good while i had it but since i know longer have the tablet. my opinion won't be worth anything.

B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It really gets your mind working.  The only thing is I wish it would stay up there for a few minutes so you could review your puzzle.  The sign comes up right away and tells you, you won.
B00AYB12PC|5.0|It was good when i saw it in the theaters and good when I streamed it.  Amazon streaming is the best out there for HD.
B00BRH2MN8|5.0|Great new music from a very talented, upcoming artist. For music lovers out there this is a definite must buy!!
B005NPCJ88|5.0|This band doesn't fail to deliver patriotism in it's music. Especially enticing when the album is on sale, completely worth five dollars.
B000ICXQUQ|5.0|I watched this movie when it first came out and decided to rent it again to show my children.  Definitely worth watching again.  Great family movie!
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Husband Nick and wife Amy are both nutters. Their crazy obsessed love,hate relationship twists and turns through bizarre and outrageous situations. You have to stop for a break just to try and process how mental these two are. But like the characters,you go back for more.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I like historical shows.  The castle like homes and the inner workings of such large estates is very interesting.  Enjoy!
B00CATSONE|5.0|What a great informative book about a very facinating man. Also a wonderful incite to the world of a creative genius.
014241543X|3.0|I'm changing my review.  -<br /><br />MY OLD REVIEW was 1 Star and read as follows: I hate writing reviews on books that I don't like because I don't want to insult living authors.  Besides, 'taste' is relative and it's fine if we don't agree.<br /><br />BUT - I bought this book because it had so many wonderful reviews, and as a 57 year old woman, I HATED it.  I want to warn others that they're NOT buying a reflective, tender, emotional story along the lines of The Lovely Bones.<br /><br />This is a teen-age love story. That's all.<br /><br />(kind of) SPOILER ALERT:  The girl gets in a car wreck that kills her entire family.  She is hanging on by a thread but the 'love' she has for her boyfriend is what will decide if she stays or goes. That's about it.  The hospital situations are ridiculous, and the characters are cartoons.  I didn't care about ANY of them except for the little brother.<br /><br />If you're 13, you might find it romantic.  If you're an adult, you might want to pass on this.<br /><br />****  NEW REVIEW:  After considering the 'replies' about my former review of 1-star on this book \\"If I Stay,\\" I decided to re-read it and then follow-up with the sequel, \\"Where She Went.\\"  I LOVED LOVED LOVED \\"Where She Went\\" and in that light and considering the combo, have raised my review of \\"If I Stay\\" to 3 stars.  I didn't enjoy \\"If I Stay\\" as much as most people, but in light of the entire story, I understand it and appreciate it more.<br /><br />In this case, I have to say that I'm so glad I was kindly challenged about my review!  My thanks to a very thoughtful and well-spoken young lady who defended this book and pointed me to a great sequel that I'll be re-reading!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Loved Downton Abbey seaoson 3!  Finished off with a great cliffhanger - can't wait to start again in September and see what happens...
B005LAIH2M|4.0|I liked this movie.  I wasn't expecting to like it, but it was actually entertaining.  Fast-paced and action filled.  I would watch it again.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I liked this book as it tells me a lot of good things that if each spouse followed these things we would all surely have a much better and happier marriage. We all need to learn our mate's love language!
B009MJU8P2|5.0|My kids have been collecting Schleich for a while, and we were pleased to find this hippo online, as we can't find it in stores.  The price is normal and with the free shipping, I didn't feel it was unreasonable.  Schleich brand toys are sturdy and very realistic, which are the main reasons I buy them for my kids.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is a captivating and at times challenging game that keeps your action for quite a long time.  I would highly recommend it to all who loved donkey kong.....
B00E8B1P9M|1.0|Have you ever wanted to watch a movie where you felt like the director hopes its good...???  G.I. Joe is five levels below that one.  It fails to find a fluid plot and the script banks on you having been an uber fan of the first movie to realize the weak motivation of one of the characters.  After the G.I. Joe team is betrayed and framed, they so secretly try to revenge the attack and secretly plan on making a movie long enough in hopes that Santa will deliver a decent script.  Neither wish is really granted (nor interesting).<br /><br />It's been awhile since I've thought about asking for a refund for a film.  The movie G.I. Joe Retaliation is successful in this attempt.
0439023521|1.0|i hate this book why is there a chatacter named after pita bread and cat nip the lady who wrote it must be crazy poor lady
B00C061I3K|5.0|I loved this album from Daft Punk.  I feel like it has a '70's vibe going on through out it.  There are a couple of songs that I could do without.  There is one song with Georgio talking throughout it that I don't care for.  But it is outweighed by &#34;Doin' it RIght' and &#34;Get Lucky&#34; among others.  I thoroughly enjoyed this album and think it is the album of the summer.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome. Right now I am in Beijing/China. Everything is so different Paris was cool but in Beijing you can climb rooftops!! I'm surprised. Why don't you people see if you can get the game in Australia.<br /><br />  Brianna
B00BX8653O|5.0|Olafur Arnalds uses vocals to flesh out his instrumentals in this album.  It is an interesting evolution in his journey.  I really enjoyed this.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|So much easier to use than some other apps I've tried. very user friendly.Would recommend for anyone like me that is trying to download books to my Kindle.
B00AB7HESI|4.0|Great game to play in short spurts. I've been able to get nearly all words and phrases represented. My only complaint is the imprecise control when objects are near each other (playing on the HTC One). Great game and I'm looking forward to the next group of puzzles.
B00005U2JL|5.0|The audio quality is amazing, everything is clear and easy to hear. Marilyn's voice sounds amazing. If you've missed out on seeing him live like I have, I would definitely recommend you buy this CD.
B006LSZECO|5.0|This was a stunning story from start to finish. Characters who felt real, scenarios that were disturbing and twists and turns that kept me turning the pages well into the wee hours. Loved it!
0307352153|4.0|Is the world designed for extroverts? Yes, according to Susan Cain, an introvert researcher.<br />This book explains the extrovert bias of business, education, and relationships through the eyes of an introvert. What I appreciate is that this work does not fall back on the simplistic dynamic of either/or–that you are one of the other. Rather, its value is in the way it helps you understand how the bias works, and how introverts can modify their behavior to function more effectively in that extroverted arena. It explains a lot; it prescribes steps to being more effective; it does both without bias or blame.
B00DRPVE3M|3.0|The game is really good, but, the ads at the home screen are hard to exit out of and sometimes will take you out of the app to your web browser. It took me about 5 times to actually play the game. Other than that is totally fine, but it's still not as good as playing the tangible version of the game.
0061537969|2.0|I bought this book on the recommendation of several friends whom I respect.<br />I tried to read it. I really did. But several chapters in, I gave up. I just didn't get it. I can't even be specific about the things I didn't like, because I cared so little. It did not engage me on any level. Books such as this seem to thrive on the same principle as horoscopes, fortune cookies, and new-age posters; they can be so general and vague that the reader is able to believe the content is speaking directly to their situation. I'm sure it is a great book; just not for me.
B00CRVZRUS|5.0|Love The Beatles and this movie classic- Blu-ray does it better. Super fast shipping and the price was right. Now I need Hard Days Night!
0452295548|5.0|The ultimate criterion for how well I like a book is the number of times I cite it or recommend it in conversation. The subject matter of Stroke of Insight keeps popping into my pre-stroke brain for a number of topics unrelated to the medical issue discussed. Taylor has written an insightful parable that touches on our fear of helplessness, while reassuring us that losing control turns out to be OK, and may in fact be the superior state of being. Unsettling, challenging, inspiring, and mostly, fascinating.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I bought this app and I loved it I could go and play with my friends without needing a server and it shows you how to craft everything the only downside is you have a limited amount of space unlike the pc or Xbox version make unlimited land and the game would be a 5 star
B000E6UK5K|2.0|I should have listened to the sample tracks before I bought this album. It is Pink Floyd-ish elevator music. Not one piece stands out.  Every song sounds very much like the others. No song has any kick or bite.  Later I discovered that the songs on this album are also on the [[ASIN:B001BKG9RQ Live In Gdansk (2 CD)]] album (CD #1), which is a 2 CD album.  I love CD #2 on Live at Gdansk.
B0011Z77OK|5.0|Great album! A lot of the hits I was looking for are on this album. I would recommend it highly
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great book with a lot of depth, the story seems relatively straightforward and easy to read, but there is lots and lots of beautiful understanding and symbolism underneath the nice and tender story.  Great book with a lot of insight.  Thank you Mr Card.
1442366621|1.0|I was so mad at myself for not realizing this was an audio book. I HATE listening to the authors read this book!!!!<br />The PDF of the diet suggestions is short and not possible to cut and paste to print out.<br />The \\"calorie counter\\" is a joke and not even necessary.<br />My suggestion is to just eat a healthy diet, fast two days a week (calories adding to about 500). If you are an informed person you already know how to eat healthily you don't need this guy pontificating in your ear!
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|First, let me say that the photos do not do this set justice.  I saw the original prototype model and was initially disappointed that this didn't seem to look as good.  However, after seeing it in person and a side by side with the prototype, I can say that not only is it better in every way, this is a great looking kit!<br /><br />It feels accurate to the show, and it's got enough room for Marty and Doc Brown to fit in the DeLorean and go on adventures, so there's a lot of play opportunity here.  Whether you're a collector or a kid, not only is it a fun build, it's great to display and fun to play with.  I've bought a lot of LEGO and I can't remember the last time I was this satisfied with a kit.<br /><br />Plus, if you're a collector/investor like me, this is going to be a great set for investment.  This comes from the same line as the Minecraft set, which jumped 400% in value the day it was discontinued.  LEGO started making it again, so you can still buy it, but the fact remains that these are low production sets with huge demand and appeal.  I think this will do better over time than Minecraft, because Back to the Future is not only a classic, but there are some very unique bricks in here that will be useful for other Back to the Future builds.  Not to mention Doc Brown and Marty are pretty unique licensed characters that won't be found anywhere else, it's not uncommon for figures like these to sell for upwards of $20 a piece!<br /><br />No matter why you're thinking about buying this set, you should stop reading this review -- and all the others -- and just buy it already.  I can't think of a better LEGO set for the price in the past 10 years.
B007JNR4WI|5.0|“During the campaign, the AWS solution helped facilitate the fund-raising of hundreds of millions of dollars, prioritized millions of phone calls and coordinated thousands of volunteers for Obama,” Amazon boasts on its Web site.<br /><br />I try to shop the BIG &#34;O&#34; First. Giant Corporations should stay out of politics and run their businesses.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is a great game. I love how you can beat vector. I think children from the age of 7 to12 should play this game.
140006922X|1.0|The author of this crap is lying in his claims to be an historian or having a PHd. in religion.. True he has a B.A. and M.A. but that is a long way from a PHd. He also teach's basiclly how to have a revolution in the middle east at Drew Univ. He has an M.A. in fictional writing too. Besides being a Muslim. Please do not take this wrong his religion matter's not...but he is NOT an historian by any sense of the word. I would suggest you look into not only his back ground but also the back ground of his publisher's, believe me it is not a pretty site. The book is FULL of miss information that is not true, look it up for yourself.
B000X5SPBI|5.0|The DVD set arrived on time and was in perfect condition. As for the show, it's one of my favorite TV series of all time.
B001AQR3E4|5.0|Pitt and Cruise together and  the bonus of Christian Slater!<br />Do not want to give away any of the movie..........................see it, buy it!
B00B22ASUM|5.0|Such an excellent read.  Finished it in one day. Couldnt put it down. I wish James and Bob the best!
B00AFEXRME|5.0|I had seen it before I purchased it and I really loved it. the end was kinda predictable, but the whole movie kept me interested. it is definitely a must see, and a must own...
B00CATSONE|4.0|I found this book very entertaining and enlightening. TheGenius of Tesla and the scope of his work are discussed in detail in the book. I did however skip the first chapter entirely because it talks about too many  things unrelated to Tesla and are opinions of the author! This book is therefore a misnomer as it does not solely focus on tesla n his work but on imagination, creativity etc from the point of view of the author with Tesla being a case in point!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great graphics, reaction speed, addictive! It is easy yet challenging.. appealable to all ages and skill levels. Don't spend the money on the extra keys tho
B007N8RULO|4.0|Good simple fun alternative to Solitaire in my opinion. Adverts a bit annoying between games, but they are easily closed down.
B000I186FW|4.0|Great acting by Portman, liked the superhero style for V. Sexual undertones not necessary as had absolutely no effect on the storyline, which is why not 5 stars.
3836538725|4.0|This is an amazing photography book. Salgado is a living master of photography.<br />If you own any other of Salgado's other books, especially Workers, you'll want to have this book.<br /><br />Only qualms, the book is enormous. The double page spreads take a bit away from the impact of the photographs since they are split down the middle by the books binding, but the images are still amazing.
B007HACDLK|5.0|Another great Vince Flynn fast paced novel.  Mich Rapp is not superman after all.  He actually gets an injury he almost can not recover from.  There are some references to previous books, but there is enough information for this book to stand on its own.  Mr. Flynn you will be missed.  RIP
B005ZC0SYQ|4.0|Works very well, as long as you see it as a graphic novel made into a movie, as opposed to an animation.<br /><br />I think Heath Ledger picked up some insights for his Joker from this one.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|Bought it for my Kindle very fun to play wit friends. If you like  competition this is your app. Worth your dollar.
B00DHNB5CY|1.0|A great cult classic RUINED! There was no need to redo that old movie, even though Bruce Campbell was part of this version. I gave 1star only because it was a SLIGHTLY different storyline.
B00B2166BS|5.0|In all honestly, the nexus 10's original charger was pretty bad, but this one is fantastic. It charges my tablet really fast, only problem is that it doesnt always stay in..the magnets arent always the strongest.
B009NQZVKG|4.0|Always enjoy the Sigma Force Novels. As usual, the end-of-novel-housekeeping is a little too quick for me. But other than that, I enjoyed the trip and liked the imbedding of quantum physics concepts into the core of the story. Rollins should consider starting a series of books for young readers (Tweens and Teens). Maybe it would help to get them interested in the various sciences. Just a thought...
B00DUIBZSK|5.0|I can't stop listening to these songs!  I had been going back and forth on whether or not I should buy it, but it was DEFINITELY worth the money.
B006WAIV6M|5.0|gave me insight into why i and others do things the same way, there is an opportunity to change your mindset
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use it daily as I drive all over Alabama for my job and going to the lake to swim and drink beer
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love Mahjong games & I play this on my Kindle HD Fire. I have other ones I play as well.
B004LROUNG|5.0|My career includes experiences with big business and lawyers . John created a most unlikely stage for a white shoe firm lawyer ending up at a firm opposite that. He wrote it in a most convincing way which sets the stage for the rest of the story. I felt like I was in the law offices ,the courts , and I felt like I knew all the people in the story.<br /><br />Like many people my time is limited and I rarely make time for fiction. I am so happy I read the story.
B006OCM0G0|4.0|This game is a lot of fun.I play this game most of the day.The only problem that I have is that I need neighbors. I'm not sure how to add them. :-(
B00819ER0Q|4.0|Movie is pretty funny. Not as funny as some of Jim Carrey's other movies but definitely worth watching. His whole life he is being filmed and at the end he finally realizes what is going on. Ending could have been better but it's worth the watch.
B005LLSZNM|5.0|This show keeps getting better and better! The characters are real and raw. One of, if not, the best series on television.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|This app is great!!! I have been waiting for this app to come out forever...but wait...that's not right. Why is the game so short? now I have to wait to get the next set of worlds? Or else I have to buy them? Okay so if I were you yes I would buy the game, sure it's fun but guess what? It has the same levels as it does in the real game. So FYI no new levels unless you wait or buy them (this also includes characters!). And when you get the game it probably won't have more than 3-5 worlds/constellations. But I might be wrong and it might have all the new ones ready to play. So basically it's great gameplay but they are always trying to get money and time out of you. Thank You if you read this all the way through. Thanks!!!
B0029LCJJS|5.0|liked it so much I am watching it again..with my husband this time around..he also likes watching it..great to replace all the summer reruns
B0072KZ0Z6|1.0|These DVDs were not compatible with my Macbook which was a pain. At first I was afraid that something had happened with my Mac that was not allowing it to play DVDs but after trying others that worked I called Apple support and they helped me figure out that the format of these DVDs are coded for another country and therefore unable to play on a Mac. I had to return them which is just annoying and I ended up buying each episode on Amazon Instant Video, but it ended up being more expensive, so it was annoying.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|This is a great show.  I love it more than any series shows on TV.  It follows right along with the book most of the time.  I like that.  I do recommend this to all.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Good story line. Finally watched the very first pilot show and it all makes sense now! LOL<br /><br />I definitely recommend watching!
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|its a fun addicting game but i dont buy into it like they want. I dont pay money for pearls. Wish it was just a fun game for kids with the incentive to buy more in order to help nemos reef grow
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|This is such a great movie, something the whole family is able to enjoy together. We love it, and watch year round.
B004ZBFRTY|5.0|Same awesome movie- just in bluray- what's nice about it though is that there's a bluray, a dvd and a digital copy. Now I have DD to watch in the living room in bluray- my bedroom in dvd format and on my laptop to go! :) A great movie! Don't think you'll be hooked after just watching this once- I've watched about 100 times and still find new details everytime I watch!
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVE LOVE LOVE this show, can't wait for the next season to come out on Prime for FREE.I'm absolutely addicted!
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Between the campaign and other challenges, this game is hard to put down.  Spending the money for the full version is completely worth it; you will not be disappointed.
B008BQ8YHQ|4.0|Well cast, well written, cool characters, complex plots and sub-plots, &#34;Suits&#34; is an enjoyable, interesting and intelligent show.  Plenty of twists and turns from this charismatic and engaging cast.  A fun show to follow.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|I so enjoy pdf files!  Nothing compares to this UNIVERSAL, free, user-friendly app.  One can't work without  it when online.
B00D6BQPMM|4.0|One of the most fun adaptations of the Shakespearian play!<br />The movie is dependent upon action and special effects but in no way does it detract from the base story.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|This is a great product that fools you when you see it. It works great and is small and inconspicuous but gives excellent protection. It is not made of cheap plastic either. The stand stays put and is not flimsy at all. I would recommend this to any kindle fire owners.
B007VDN1PA|5.0|This slide/negative scanner way exceed my expectations.  I used it to scan old 35mm slides.  It worked great and was easy to use.  The negative brightness was corrected automatically, the digital conversion was seamless, and the results were excellent.  Yes you have to load them one at a time, but it is a simple procedure and the resulting digital images are priceless.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|As always, at least for me, Michael Pollan delivers the goods.  His writing style, along with  the information that has been researched to the max, is a great read.  He is the one author that makes me really think about our food sources and how they get to the table.  Thank heaven he has committed his writing to a topic that helps all.  Do I sit and read his books cover to cover--absolutely.  Then I go back and read every section on it's own.  I have all of his books and will continue to buy his books, which will hopefully be a very long time.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Good movie worth watching.  Contains all the elements in a fun, exciting, and humorous movie.  Good for the entire family.
B000TNF7NS|5.0|\\"Force it\\" is a natural evolution traced by the band in relation to what they had created with their previous release.<br />This album is heavier, more cohesive and leaves behind all traces of late psychedelia from Bolton's era that remained. You may even discuss whether \\"high flyer\\" is still a remaining heritage of this genre, indeed it might be, but nothing changes the fact that the music is very beautiful.<br /><br />Although many people complains about the production skills of Leo Lyons, in my opinion it sets the right tone for the heavy weight of MS guitar work  and Pete Way' s bass . The rest he choose to leave in charge of the band. The intervention of sporadic Chick Churchill on the piano is in the right measure, without exaggeration as we can find in \\"no heavy Petting\\".<br />The tracks here persist in greater numbers up to nowadays in the set list and in the live anthologies from their catalogue, compared to Phenomenon: Let it roll, shoot shoot, this kids, mother mary and Out in the streets can be heard and found easily, and not without good reasons for that.<br /><br />There is no weak song on this album, just outstanding songs and memorable songs.<br /><br />Schenker playing is even ore conneced with the rest of the band and fits perfecty with Mogg's lyrics and melodies. Yes there are many melodies floating through the heavy stuff here, and that brings a special color to the sound of the record.<br />A forgotten song, \\"dance your life away\\" has one the ost memorable guitar solos ever.<br /><br />Mother Mary was the first song I heard from them and it is still my favorite. Incidentally this is my favorite record, and even more, the best hard rock of all time, in my humble opinion.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B004KPX4W2|5.0|This movie lived up to all the previews for me. I really enjoyed it and found it to be really funny.
B000TNF7OC|5.0|Phenomenon is the beginning of a new era for UFO, once  deciding to leave behind the days of Pink Floydian - Hawkwindian space rock. Not only was the choice for heavy rock, but the exchange of guitarists helped changing their sound and so they finally gained an identity.<br />The formula here begins what would be known as classic UFO 70's sound, mixing heavy tracks with ballads. some of it's ballads and their lyrcs (eg.: Space child, crystal light, time on my hands) still remind some kind of late psychedelic stuff, but not that much. The transition was in high standard.<br />The album features two tracks that have become timeless classics not only for the band and their concerts but as per all hard rock classic rock fans in general.<br />The production by Leo Lyons makes the record sound  raw, without great arrangements, which is not really bad at all, because besides Schenker riffs, the songs here are do not demand elaborates studio work.<br />Overall, an excellent heavy rock album which I love and recommend.
1400052181|5.0|This was an enjoyable nonfiction read, that didn't come off as overly scientific.  Despite details and scientific explanations, you do not get bogged down in the science.  This is a good pick  (and quick) to read for anyone.
0307887960|5.0|I have never been a diet person my spouse needed to lose weight. But I have found the lifestyle change was great for me. I ended up unintentionally loosing weight. I have a horrible sweet tooth with my A1C glucose lab result being slightly higher than 5yrs ago. I know that my risk for diabetes is higher. With following the diet in our household for 7 weeks. My spouse lost 3O pounds and I lost 8 pounds. I weighed 118 and I am now 110. This from just eating right. This diet works.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|If you liked the movie you will no doubt like the book. While reading it I was reminded of scenes from the movie. Entertaining read!
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|all of the doctors are great and this one was no exception, highly recommend if you are a Doctor Who  fan.
B000RO9VJK|5.0|Michael was practical, logical and provides easy steps to take to implement the changes you want.  Fantastic and would recommend to any small business owner.
B002RKRGQ2|5.0|I think I got this as a free download many years ago. Still haven't read it. Four more words required.
B009JZTOG8|4.0|It is about 10 percent  reality (relationships) and about 90 percent messed up nursery Disney stories.  I liked predicting what they would throw in the mix next.  Beware though, good turns bad and bad turns to good quite often.. Don't take it as lessons for real life!!
1608871452|5.0|This was delivered a day earlier than estimated. It is an extremely nice book, full of fun surprises. There are small &#34;post card&#34; type pictures in the book that are for you to take out. However they are glued in on the corner rather well so it is difficult to remove without ripping the page underneath. I would recommend just lifting them to see whats underneath. If you do however decide to remove them take extremely cautious care.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Yes for  sure be sure to read Fall of Giants first.  I can not wait for his part three in Sept
B000M53GM2|3.0|The first DVD issue released in 1997 (MGMs very first release on that format) is a 6.48 Gig flipper disc, with a full-screen version on side A, and a non-anamorphic widescreen one on side B (2.35:1 Scope). Measly extras are Spanish and French DD 2.0, audio commentary, production notes, and theatrical trailer (warning!! IN EXTREMELY PI$$ POOR VHS QUALITY). Audio quality is OK, but boy the picture quality!  The WS version uses the analog master made for the laserdisc and has REALLY BAD picture quality!! From flickering, combing, shimmering (and lots of it baby!!), to blocking and etc., you name it! The FS version on the other hand, looks like a center crop/pan & scan of the film negative, and sadly is of better visual quality than the widescreen version. But like the latter, it suffers from mosquito noise and blocking. This release has cover art similar to the movie poster (and the 1999 issue, minus \\"Speical Edtion\\" with a gold band), and if you have to have every single video edition of every bond film made, this is for you. But there are later releases superior to this one so skip the 1997 issue if possible.<br /><br />- UPDATE ON THIS RELEASE -<br /><br />There's what appears to be later printings of this disc that is said to have the WS side 16:9 enhanced (covers and such the same, but with \\"16:9 widescreen\\" in the back specs instead of plain ol' \\"widescreen\\") . It is unknown if it uses the LD master blown to 16:9 or uses the film master used on the 1999 SE release.<br /><br />Next is the 1999/2000 Special Edition, released when they were putting other bond titles on DVD for the first time in this SE series. Unlike the previous release, this one uses a digital remaster created from the film negative, is anamorphic 2.35:1 widescreen, and has far better picture quality; so the trite LD quality of the first release is not present here (YAY!). Audio is practically the same as the last release, sans the Spanish audio. However, the DD 5.1 mix is a slightly different mixthan 5.1 track on the previous DVD (which was sourced from the LD), meaning it doesn't sound as \\"crisp\\" and outputs at a softer volume, but still of stellar quality. Unlike the last release MGM decided to apply decent special features here! With an additional audio commentary, there are making of featurettes, TV spots, backstage stuff with the actors/producers, 2 theatrical trailers (the 1st one being much better quality here than on the last release), and a chalkboard grinding music video with a fluffy making of feature on how that piece of ship went together.<br /><br />- UPDATE ON THIS RELEASE -<br /><br />There's a small error on the back of the cover where the film says its rated \\"PG\\", but the official MPAA rating is \\"PG-13\\". Kinda funny since most PG rated films contain more intense stylized violence and gross innuendos.<br /><br />The Ultimate Edition release from 2006 by MGM/Sony (later repackaged/reissued by MGM/fox) ports the ENG DD 5.1 and French 2.0 tracks and most of the features from the 2nd release (minus the horrid music video), while it adds a few new ones and a 768kbps DTS 5.1 ENG track (which brings back the crispness and beefy surrounds of the 1st DVD/LD audio). There is yet again another new digital transfer of the film. However, while sharper and clearer than the last release, it suffers from DVNR issues and is slightly zoomed in (roughly 4%) on all four sides, making the PQ on this release inferior to the previous.<br /><br />The Blu-Ray version, issued last year in the Bond 50 series, ports material from the 2nd and UE releases, adds a few such as a Bond 50 montage, and drops a few dated ones. Audio options are ENG 7.1 DTS-MA, DD 5.1 EX in English, French, Spanish, and DD 2.0 in Japanese and Portuguese plus commentaries. There is another new 4K transfer similar to the UE one. The differences here are sharper picture quality, corrected framing (no more zoomed in shots), and a pedestrian MGM Lion/Tom Cruse era United Artists logo combo replacing the unique UA \\"Stone Marble\\" logo that started the film on prior releases.<br /><br />- UPDATE: NEW DVD RELEASE ADDITION -<br /><br />I got this at Wal*Mart for $11.97 in their DVD bin. It is NOT A REPACKAGE of the Ultimate Edition, but rather a bare bones port of the Bond 50 Blu-Ray, with cover art identical to the that release. Specs are: Anamorphic Widescreen 2.40:1, ENG DD 5.1, ENG 5.1 DVS, French 2.0 Stereo, and an new audio commentary. When I said bare bones, DAMN RIGHT I MEAN BARE BONES!! Scanning through the VOB files shows the film, menus, Bond 50 BD Trailer, Skyfall trailer, and MGM DVD/FOX HE logos all on this measly 4.48 gig disc. No UE or SE extras, not even the Goldeneye trailer, NOTHING!!! However, this release is not all bad. Its transfer is a port of the BDs, and has best Picture and Sound out of all the Goldeneye DVD issues. (It even reinserts the UA Marble logo, with MGMs newest logo preceding it) Purists may avoid it cause of its lack of any bonus material, but should look into it for the most improved DVD release of Goldeneye in terms of PQ and Sound. If they still don't like it, let 'em keep their old releases plagued with poor LD quality, foolscreen versions, trite music videos,  DVNR smearing, and zoomed in shots.
0515153656|2.0|Mr. Child, go read the Red Pony by Steinbeck! Please....  I had just finished my fourth read of Tony Hillerman's Navajo mysteries, my third reading of the first seven Patricia Cornwell books, and my second reading of Jesse Stone and Sonny Randal from Robert B. Parker.  So, the big search began. Didn't last long because I saw the Jack Reacher film and decided this is it -- I gotta read Reacher!  Right?  Wrong!  Maybe on a slow, terminally drowsy day with nothing to do -- maybe if I'd already watched my lawn die.  Lee Child doesn't write prose -- he writes grocery lists.  Lesson 1 -- in first person we don't need to know absolutely everything the hero thinks, feels, and does.  I reached page 100 and beyond banging his face on another guy's face Jack's done ZERO!  What Reacher does in the first 180 pages is enough to give a truly good action/suspense writer thirty pages -- TOPS! His style is to write endless sentence fragments, putting them together in paragraphs like jigsaw puzzles on the page.  But at the bottom of the page nothing has happened.  He reads a folded up newspaper five times, he goes to relieve himself in the toilet, he lusts after a girl who works in the sheriff's office, and all the way he keeps a running, amateurish commentary on what everyone is doing and how he could do it better.  Bottom line: you put a hundred chimps in a room, each with a typewriter, and give them a hundred years to bang away on their Olivetti's -- they'd come up with a Jack Reacher book.  Writing is about feelings, about soul, about touch and finesse, and knowing what you're doing.
B008MEM24S|4.0|Fun and challenging. Love that you can skip a frustrating level. Looking forward to more levels and challenges. I like the Doofinshmirtz quests.

B000050WZY|5.0|I bought this album on vinyl format and absolutely love it. The great thing about this product is that, for those Beatles fans who don't want to have to pick out each song that they like from the albums, this one has them all back-to-back. This album is absolutely perfect.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have only played this a few times. I mainly got it for my grandchildren. They all love playing Temple Run 1 edition so though they may like a little more challenge with edition 2. I was right... Fast passed game that requires your concentration and quick hand...

B0060D0Z0G|5.0|Love the story line about Secretariat and also about Penny, the owner.  The race scenes are exciting watching them over and over.
B000069HKH|5.0|This album was recorded with 9/11 in mind, but the raw emotion illustrated in many of the songs is relatable to anyone who has ever suffered a major loss or tragedy in their lives. &#34;Into the Fire&#34; and &#34;You're Missing&#34; were especially comforting to me after the loss of my grandmother.
B00DYEN6XC|5.0|This version of Man of Steel did a good job of telling the backstory of Krypton and of his youth then telling the struggles of becoming of the hero that we all love today.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|so action filled it promotes dispecable me so much.  I love love love love it so so so much.  it is fun it is like temple run
B00CY1JUW2|5.0|I have their Songs for the Deaf album and I loved it. Dave Grohl (my favorite drummer) played drums on that one. I listened to one of their albums after SFTD and It didn't feel like the same band. When this album came out I was very interested because of SFTD and the Them Crooked Vultures album. I am glad I took a flier on this one because it is awesome from beginning to end. I have listened to it back to back before. This album especially sounds good on the headphones! This is probably the best album I have heard all year!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|This movie has everything. Action, suspense, drama and a little romance. It should appeal to just about everyone. I never read the books, but from what I hear the storyline follows the book pretty well.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This app is very easy to use and offers hours of enjoyment.  The display is very clear and easy to read.
B0000524E5|5.0|Love the music and the story line and Piper is a fantastic singer.  Overall a really great movie, one I have watched multiple times.<br />Would recommend this movie to anyone.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|I like the game but some of the levels are so hard that it just stresses me out and i hate it. I'm not going to delete the game, i just wish that it was easier.
B002ZG9774|5.0|Loved everything, have always loved Cher and Christina was great, overall this was a fantastic movie, would recommend this to everyone.  I already owned the DVD but wanted the Bluray, so I bought the new one.
140006922X|5.0|Not much of what Mr. Aslan says is new in this field as he himself admits.  It is a great read, though.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Entertaining and unpredictable.  Interesting characterizations. We are looking forward to Season 2 and only wish that there were more episodes in Season 1.
0345529057|5.0|I got hooked on the show and wanted to find out what was still to come. So far the books are as great as the HBO series.
B0081336FO|5.0|We immensely enjoyed viewing Season 1 and were not disappointed in Season 2.  We found the characterizations to be fascinating and immensely enjoyed it.  We are looking forward to Season 3.
B008JFUR10|5.0|I admit I was a bit scheptical, but I need to keep a few 11 year old boys entertained for an afternoon so we went to see this movie.  And I loved it.  It was a pretty good story, the monster and robot beat downs were fantastic!  The few complaints I had are that we didn't get to know the other Yeager crews very well, just the 2 that a focused on later in the movie.  And the Ron Pearlmen scenes I thought felt a little flat.  I enjoyed this a lot more than the Man of Steel movie.  If you have the chance to see it on the big screen do so as soon as possible.  I can't wait to get the Blu-ray.
B009K0OL06|5.0|I view the entire season 1 on Netflix and could wait for Revenge Season 2 to be release on DVD!  So, Amazon Instant Video was welcome relief for my sanity after getting hooked on Revenge Season 1!  I'm a fan!
B003D81NVQ|5.0|This was one of my very first purchases on Amazon Prime.  I think I'm going to like the service very much.  We record all the episodes but the DVR filled up and three episodes did not get recorded.  Amazon Prime to the rescue:  we were able to easily and quickly find the three missing episodes and watch them in HD.  LOVE IT!
B002ZG994U|4.0|Like \\"Shaft\\" with Jackson as the title character, this film could bear to have a sequel or three.  The chemistry between the characters is excellent, which is the real key to success.<br /><br />Unlike \\"Shaft\\", which was realistic and well acted, this was a virtual cartoon.  Yet apart from some of the ham acting, and many problems keeping my disbelief suspended, everything worked.  I *loved* the scene where the German woman giggled when her husband's boat was overturned.  Every time I watch the film again, I giggle along with her.
B00CAJMGDI|5.0|Lindsey's talents combined with a more modern sound make for beautiful music. Would love to see a second album possibly with some of her collaboration work with Peter Hollens and William Joseph.
B001QB9H1A|4.0|Someone else mentioned and I agree that the film would have been far better had Mila Jovovich been his co-star in this one.<br /><br />The theme was good --anti-pollution-- but there was less humor than usual and his friend Inspector Tarconi should have had a much bigger part - François Berléand gives very good value for money.  The two stunts at the end of the film were wonderful.
0385523912|5.0|Well written and very interesting (not to mention sad) to learn about the lives of ordinary people in North Korea.  The write gives you a good sense of being in their homes, at work and dealing with the harsh conditions and lack of food and freedom.
0307730700|4.0|Most people I know enjoy good stories. We like the story of the guy who suffered through incredible odds and ended up achieving. We love the story of the the man or woman who overcame incredible odds to win. I believe many in our culture today are looking for heroes. They are looking for people they can turn to for hope, strength, and courage. After reading the life account of Adam Brown, I think he was one of those men.<br /><br />Eric Blehm has chronicled the life of Adam Brown in his book, Fearless. The subtitle explains the point of this book: \\"The Undaunted Courage and Ultimate Sacrifice of Navy SEAL Team SIX Operator Adam Brown.\\" Let me say from the outset that I really enjoyed this book. The penmanship was superb, but only outmatched by the life it described. I really could not put this book down.<br /><br />\\"One of Adam Brown's final wishes, written by hand on his CACO form, was that his spiritual testimony--his complete story--be told, including 'my life before I met Jesus Christ and Kelley.' You can appreciate now just how fearless Adam had been when he requested others to share that dark period from his past. Even in death, he selflessly and publicly risked tainting his own legacy sot hat others might be inspired to seek faith and overcome their own struggles\\" (251).<br /><br />That is what this book was all about. Yes, it was mostly about how he was a fearless man as he worked his way up to the most elite squad of military, SEAL Team SIX. But Blehm did not shy away from showing the dark years of his life. [I don't want to give too much away, so I won't expand on what the dark years were in his life]. After those dark years, it did seem that Brown did come to know Jesus. The gospel message of Jesus did seem to be a priority for him as he continued to fight the past demons and the demands of the military.<br /><br />Considering I have not read much of the Navy SEALS, I found the information into his training very insightful. The thing that impressed me themost was how he passed the SEAL Team SIX training while being impaired. [Once again, read the book to find out what happened]. As the book progressed, I knew that the way he died would be described. But once I was there, it was still difficult to read. His life was so real to me through the written word that I wished there was some way to save him. He was that sort of man.<br /><br />There is no doubt after reading this book that Adam Brown was a real soldier, one that makes me proud to be an American. But I think he would never have called himself a hero. He would have said that he was just doing his job. He would have been quick to pass the \\"hero\\" badge to Jesus, the author and perfecter of his faith. If you are looking for a great story of a man who became all he could be (I know it's not a Navy slogan, sorry), then Fearless is for you. It's really good. Below is a short video about the book that might encourage you to read it as well.<br /><br />Warning: I do feel the need to put one warning in this review. There is some language in this book that might be offensive to some people. It is not pervasive, but it does exist.<br /><br />I received a copy of Fearless by Eric Blehm from WaterBrook Press for review
0793518326|5.0|It's really nice to have the bass, solo and chord progressions all in one book.  This book makes it easy to learn any guitar/bass part of any of their songs.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|It is fun and easy to do. I like that you can repeat the levels until you get a perfect score.....guess it must be my OCD!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I down loaded this game and I have not put it down all day. It is so fun and I love it.

B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have seen season's 1 & 2 & season 3 was just as good. It is a great story line. I can't wait for season 4 to start.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|This game is cool lot of technology and really challenging but that's what makes it fun. I give it 5 stars but it only has one bad thing. If u buy an armor it looks different  when u play than in the store.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME . IT IS COMPLETELY ADDICTIVE AND LOTS OF FUN .  I RECOMMEND IT FOR ALL AGES
B00AEFXOWC|1.0|The seller sent me the 2004 2-discs version instead of 2013 2-discs version.<br />The DVD cover is also different from as depicted.
B0013KTGAG|5.0|Sunshine explores the dark side of scientific interventions and their accompanying philosophical/moral dilemmas.  The wicked best part is the unexpected twist and mystery of an &#34;alien&#34; being aboard the ship who, potentially, could reside in all of us if given the extreme conditions the scientists faced while deep into the black and on the edge of reality.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is fantastic for killing boredom and is great for most ages. The only bad point I can think of is the fact the there isn't a way to  crate characters which would make the game much more interesting. Overall I love this app and could not live without it!!!!!! :)
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I would recommend this book to everybody on the face of the frikin planet because it's sooooooooooooooooooo sooooooooooooooooooo amazing! I gave it a five star rating because I read it 7 times and every time I've laughed and friend but never once have I wanted to stop reading and do something else!!!!!!!!!!!! And I wish that Stephanie Meyer would continue writing Midnight Sun!!!!!!!!! I love every Twilight Saga book on the face of the planet and I'm going to read another one right this moment bye!!!!!!!!
B009UX2YAC|1.0|Are you guys going to take forever to actually update the game like last time?????  I seriously hope not. Last time almost miss the weekly challenge.
B00AYM6JFO|5.0|Willie Nelson does it again. He sings old favorites and reminds us that we need to &#34;Face the music and dance&#34;. It puts a positive spin on our living! I love Willie Nelson!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|This is a nice game! Not all that exciting, but definitely interesting! My cousin would love it. Wish I had a real horse.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Downton Abbey Seasons 1, 2 & 3 kept me glued to the show for hours on end. The cast is particularly exceptional, as is the dialogue and storyline. The locations are awesome and I love the glorious train scenes! That train is spectacular!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game it is so cool because all of the horses look like that they are alive . I shoud now. because I own one so suck on that.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|Neil Gaiman's book was a really good read.  Set in the English countryside, it tells of a young boy's encounter with something far beyond his capability to comprehend.  The storyline had twists that I couldn't see coming.  At the same time, it was a wonderful evocation of a boy's natural responses to strange circumstances.  Well worth your time.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I love the witty bromance between Harvey & Mike. The story lines are great and the characters are amazing!!!! Can't wait to see more
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This novel makes practically no sense to me. First of all, the tone is deeply confusing for a work of fiction. Also what's with all the endnotes? Like, I got through Infinite Jest but these ones weren't even funny! Sometimes, I got the impression the author wasn't even trying to entertain me.<br />The ending was also very disappointing. Given my childhood in catholic school, I found the denouement very predictable. Even worse, the characters felt deeply underdeveloped. Without good character development, we're just left wondering why Jesus did any of this at all! Honestly, avoid this novel. It's a waste of your time.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|This game is totally awesome! I love it, I just think there should be a red hair spray colour but overall, this game is for anyone and I really enjoy it, and if you buy it, zzz I hope you enjoy it too, SO BUY IT!  :)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is amazing and awesome!!! this is way better than subway suffers!!!! LOVE IT!!!! DAVE IS AWESOME! I love how you can turn
B00CMYRVAO|5.0|All I have to say is that with a head bobbing, dancing in your seat (while at work or in the car) song like Something For You being the 1st Track on a CD; the rest of the CD has to be ALL GOOD, and it is!! Just when I didn't think that Joe could outdo his Signature CD, I must admit that Joe's DoubleBack - Evolution of R&B CD has done just that and MORE! I don't have just one favorite song on the CD, because ALL of the songs have become my favorites!! I'd Rather Have A Love, Love & Sex f/Fantasia, Something For You, Sexy, & Baby, are all on my That's My Jam list. Normally when an R&B singer finds love (at last) they tend to fall off on their future CD's because they are no longer experiencing the pain of failed relationships anymore, but Joe has shown me on the DoubleBack CD that not only has he found true love; he can sing about it and still give all the single listeners some positive (relationship) hope but in the meantime, finger snap, head bob, and shake our butts to his CD!!  I LOVE the DoubleBack CD & so will you! God Bless!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I had not read a Stephen King in quite some time but this book grabbed me.  And it grabbed me every time I walked by it and it grabbed me when I had a couple of minutes to spare...and when I had many things I should have been doing!  Certainly no qualms about recommending it...It is great!
1878424319|5.0|Great book for personal development,it helps me to identify the unconscious agreements that had prevented me from growing You should know that to become a conscious producer you must untie the knots to break through, I recommend other books like( Power of Now) by Eckhart Tolle, (Conversation with God) by Neale Donlald Walsch.
B00C2FFJFM|5.0|I love this album.i bought it last weekend.i didnt know 2 much about selena gomez.i never watched her disney shows or never heard her previous cds.I became interested when i watched the billboard music awards this year and saw the \\"come and get it\\" performance.im a big fan of the song.So i took a chance and bought this cd thinking maybe ill like half the songs but i was in for a surprise.I love each song,theres not a bad song on the cd. Ive had this album for 5 days now and ive heard the album 4 times so far.thanks selena and cant wait for the next album!
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|waste of time .. maybe V2 will be better .. slow, unresponsive .. Google claim it works with ChromeBook but then chromecast says MacBook Pro not enough performance to stream  , on a fast wifi network
1616550414|5.0|When I bought this book I was expecting just a little book with some history and timeline. I was utterly wrong: it's a huge book, in full color, with story, characters, the much-hoped timeline, drawings. As a huge fan of The Legend of Zelda - who started playing as an 9-year-old little girl and has even TLoZ:OoT-inspired tattoos, this book is a must-have.
B000055Y12|5.0|I know this movie isn't typically hailed as one of the best of Hitchcocks films, but I love it.  I grew up in the 60's and therefore really enjoy the costumes, the plot and the intrigue.  One of my all-time favorite Hitchcock scenes is in the movie -- the scene where Juanita dies and falls to the floor.  As Juanita falls, her deep purple dress spreads out around her and it looks like blood.  It emphasizes the tragedy of Juanita's death without actually using blood.  For this one scene alone, this movie should be in your Hitchcock collection.  I watch this movie over and over for this scene, but there are many other really terrific Hitchcock moments.  Watch it and find a few favorites of your own.
0930289234|5.0|I don't like superhero comics, never read DC or Marvel heroes. And I never watched the movie. But my boyfriend said &#34;you're gonna like it&#34;. I decided to take a try, and I wasn't regretted. I really love this graphic novel (is it a graphic novel? I think so). It's thrilling and makes you think about the world, about people, about humankind. Everybody should read it,
B0015DWJX2|5.0|This is another look at WWII that surprised me. I rate this along with Sarah's Ket and the Hotel at the Corner of Bitter and Sweet.

Still, I really like the drawings and colors.<br />My problem is that I'm still beginning to read, and this deck is way too difficult to read for me. I'll continue making most my readings with my Radiant Rider-Smith untill I get confident to read with Paulina Tarot.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|I love this film so much and I'm so glad I bought the combo because I have the physical copy that I can watch but I also have the digital version I can watch when traveling.<br />Brit Marling is exceptionally talented as an actress and screenwriter and I can't wait to see more films she puts out in the future.
B001GJ3BPU|3.0|I don't see what the fuss was about! Everyone in the comics universe called it one of the worst films!<br />It actually had a pretty solid story and acting!<br />Too bad there wasn't at least a follow up (like in The Hulk/Incredible Hulk) treatment!
B0015ABRE2|5.0|i got this dvd in no time and i enjoyed season three alot! it wasnt damaged and it worked just fine thank you!
0061906220|5.0|My 2 and 3 yr old sons love this book and we sing the song together. When i pull out the book, they run to the rocking chair very excited. The pictures are adorable and the pattern in the book is cute and the kids learn it quickly to repeat along with me. I would recommend this book. I have just purchased another &#34;Pete&#34; book and am hoping we like it as much as this one.
B002N5N5M0|5.0|the dvd came in no time! i am currently watching it and i am already enjoying it! it had no damage to it thank you!
B00BGIBVP8|4.0|Pee in your pants funny. It was great to see that the only characters who have matured were the children!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Easy to set up, easy to use. Quality is great and it just works with all of my phones and iPad.
B00C90T4QK|5.0|Good new album by Michael. It has several duets with well known artists. This is a good mix of pop and smooth easy listening.
140006922X|1.0|Anyone who spent so much time to debunk Christianity and didn't enough to abandon Islam cannot be taken seriously on any level.  [...]
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Finally upgraded my mouse after about 8 years of using the Logitech Mx-518.  First thing I noticed about the new Anker mouse was the braided cable, which frankly gives me a little bit of a concern since I have a cat and she might find the braided cable more interesting to play with since she can grip it better between the threads with her claws.  Seems to have more flexibility and I don't have to continuously be aware of where my mouse cord is going which is kinda nice.  The feel of the mouse is quite good, a little similar to my mx518.  Apparently I have stubby hands or at least a stubby thumb, because it doesn't quite reach the lead thumb mouse button.  I guess that's ok since i'm not accustomed to using 3 mouse buttons anyway.  The mouse scroll is pretty nice, good sensitivity.<br /><br />One thing i'm a little weird about is that you have the option to change the color of the LED's in the mouse, but only for the logo.  The mouse scroll LED and 2 LED's over the thumb are not color programmable which makes me wonder why even bother making one programmable if all of them arent?<br /><br />Overall i'm quite satisfied with the mouse thus far.
1475143389|5.0|Bigger Leaner Stronger is a good read and I highly recommend it to anyone who has an interest in going to the gym. It carefully breaks down the essentials of building a good, fit and healthy body and is also a motivational read for anyone who may be plateauing or struggling to find a good routine. What I particularly like about Mike's book is that it offers choice and variety, depending on how regularly you can make it to the gym, depending on what you are trying to achieve and depending on what supplements you are taking.<br /><br />Mike breaks each section down to a relatively basic level, so it is easy to follow and the science that backs it up is fairly comprehendible. The bonus report is also extremely useful so I recommend you download that once you have finished reading the book.<br /><br />Cheers
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazing. Filled with words I couldn't understand and had to look up to get the true meaning of what the story was telling<br /> Taught me a lot about life and showed me an interesting outlook on the universe
B00821PCJS|5.0|Yes, it's an alien invasion show, but it's very rarely cheesy. The characters are well-drawn and their lines reflect their individuality; that's especially true for Pope. He's a hoot. There's lots of Henry V-type speechifying, but there's also a twist around every corner. I love the show and enjoyed watching the first season again, now that the third one is just about in the can.
B0056CUZRA|5.0|Having previously read (and loved) Pillars of the Earth and World Without End by Ken Follet I decided to start on this trilogy. I have not been disappointed and would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the previously mentioned series and this writers style.
B008602KQI|4.0|I enjoyed it and try to not compare to every detail of the book, so works even better for me.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Fails to mention that you can't get further without buying. Disappointed in the dev for relying on cliffhanger to get you to buy. Overall, good and fun while it lasted. Would have been happier with ads and full game.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|I've always liked a good British family saga, & this series continuously delivers.  I enjoy the rich period displays, from costumes to etiquette, to the distinctive class structures & erosions thereof.  It also keeps you guessing, what next?  The actors are so good in their roles, that it's wretched when one departs.  A definite 4-stars!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is amazing I play it all day everyday .Thank God for this game I can't go a day without it I love love love love love it
B003M70O5O|4.0|I would never consider this type of drama to appeal to me, but I was hooked by the end of the very 1st episode.  All of the seasons build on each other & ratchet the tension up.  I am waiting for season 5, & yes season 2 is fantastic!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I didn't think anything could ever be better than subway surfer but this amazing minion game has  blown my mind!
B00A822VDY|5.0|I always liked this movie, but only recently purchased it for my 5 year old daughter - who closely resembles &#34;Boo&#34;. :-)  She loves it, and I love watching it with her.  It actually made her less afraid of the &#34;monsters&#34; in the closet and under the bed.
B00AQ71FLK|4.0|Like watercraft kind of<br />It is fun but has no story line and you need really good internet to play it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Ok this game is amazing what you do is run from a cop and dog and you can collect things to help you out. My favorite is the jetpack you get to go up not the air and there aren't and obstacles only coins!  And you can also do missions like &quot;collect 200 coins with a magnet&quot; or &quot;jump 30 times in one run&quot;! I suggest getting this game!
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This book was not only a very moving tribute to a fallen hero but a wonderful example of overcoming addiction to be a contributing member of society.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Amazing game. If you're looking for a great RPG this will do the trick. It's well over a ninety hour experience for those wanting to 100%have it.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|Had me at the edge of my seat. I never wanted to put it down. My heart pounded, I laughed, cried, and smiled. So touching to read!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I can't get enough of this show. It's full of surprises and if you love zombies, it's a must-watch. You'd be smart to pick up the first season though. Enjoy.
B0049H9NVW|5.0|I saw this game at a vendor booth at Anime Boston, but wasn't ready to buy it at the time. It looked intriguing and fun, and colorful!<br /><br />Eventually, I did buy it and we played it the night it arrived. I love everything about this game.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|One of my favorite shows of all time. This is probably the best of the seasons. It has a little bit of everything and is a great show to pick up if you are a zombie fan.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had to have my granddaughter show me how this game works, since I did not play games before this one.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't wait until the next updates and been going on kindle fire hd they get next updates. I wonder if can updates minecraft pocket edition be for August 22 2013
B009CG29RK|5.0|Love this movie. Saw it in the theater, saw it on Amazon Instant download, saw it on tv, Going to keep watching and laughing!
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|It seemed to bog down a few times.  The story line was interesting though.  I actually think that I like reading the Jack Reacher books than watching a movie.
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|doesn't download. says there is an error so may be a glitches.  not sure if anyone else has this issue on Kindle. hoping they fix.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|No doubt that Denzel Washington is an excellent actor and he play his role very effectively.  I guess, I was not to wild about the story line so it seemed to go on way too long to hold my interest.
B000069AUI|4.0|I bought this album to complete my catalogue of Coldplay albums.  I enjoyed the album overall, but it was a little disappointing to me compared to Parachutes.  I do recommend A Rush of Blood to the Head to anyone who loves Coldplay, but don't expect it to be another Parachutes,
B00CWVGBEO|4.0|Do you like a lot of action?  Do you really not give a %^&# about a plot?  Then, this movie is for you.  Arnold is his usual man-of-few-words character and doesn't take any cr_p off of anybody.  Lots of fighting and car action.  Would not recommend this for young kids to watch.
B00062IVKI|5.0|I love Liza and Robert De Niro and this was perfect to order on amazon, it's a classic you just need  a glass of wine and enjoy. :-)
B009GEFXLC|5.0|Can not wait for the new season to start....it is what all Castle fans have been waiting for and the suspense is killing me...LOL!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This is the best book I've ever read In my life. The book is so touching its great. Just wow
145210655X|5.0|Also bought this for a father day gift for my brother in law. It's perfect because it's an original gift! No one would ever expect a present that can be shared with the entire family. He reads it to my nephews and niece. They all enjoy it!
B0060MYM7O|5.0|My friend bought me the first year of the Game of Thrones and I loved it.  This is the best series ever!!  If you want a little bit of everything this series has it.  Great story line that changes with new characters....great acting...and just a great series.
B000BBOUD6|5.0|This movie was the best of it's time and will always holds it's own. You could watch this one again, and again. It's got it all. Very intense!
B008WCP2PG|4.0|the seller delivered on time and intact. however the movie has no plot and was not worth the money. you could just put it on mute and i would be the same quality as if you were listening to it,
B003UPPO2G|5.0|These tunes are the best. Truly talented, so many hits. You got to watch this, puts you in a great mood.
B002361MLA|4.0|Presence is more easily attained than realized. Most of us think we need to use OUR mind's, when we can surrender moment by moment to God, with whom we are one, thus eliminating our ego from the situation, which constantly tries to separate us from God and the peace that results from our oneness with our Creator.
B003LSTK8G|4.0|I found this book to be a very interesting read. I highly recommend it to anyone interested in understanding the financial crisis and the culture at Wall Street.
B00D8OHPF8|4.0|Very Smooth, Soulful, Melodic, Rhythmic, Bluesy!!! Another winning collection from a guy who knows how to croon and how to get down with a groove!!
0770437400|5.0|Really addicting and exciting. Did not get bored from reading it for the first time ever. Wish the book didnt end.
B000HAB4KS|5.0|Great twists in this classic, dystopian sci-fi action thriller. Fantastic action and plot, effects very slightly dated. Highly rec seeing this one if you haven't... it is a classic.
B000FBJAEG|5.0|King and Maxwell together always make for a great read. Only a master like Baldacci can weave a tale like this with continued suspense.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Me and my older sister think that it is a really good game even better than subway surfers and temple. run its not a ripoff when we had gotten an app called gingerbread run or pencil man run because every single time you went to do a turn or something you'd fall in the water but in this one you don't do that it's sooo much better than games like that.so this is why we give this game a five star rating
B0094BB4TW|4.0|It works fine, but for some reason every tome I'm on Facebook it asks me if I want to update it, and it leads you to the Play Store and not The Kindle Store, and It doesn't show New updates when you're on the buying page of the app!
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Great actors and good drama although a little bloody at times.  Can't wait until the next season.  Would recommend this in a heartbeat.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|I love this album. I could listen to the songs over and over again. If your a Fiona Apple fan then I recommend this album to buy.
0345529057|5.0|swell awesome fab fabulous no comprendo halla at this review yes books done writing done erythang big! greatly grateful i am!
B00CKOYVG8|4.0|This game is so much fun! you can play with your friends on Facebook  and compete against them with new maps every week
B0094MAZKK|5.0|I'm an action junkie and an old school martial arts fan from Kung Fu Theater on Saturday afternoons and all day Sunday on USA Network after Cartoon Express. I know how I like my action and I've seen great movies, ok flicks, and just some plain, bad martial arts films. You've got your classics like Enter the Dragon and 36 Chambers to Bloodsport, Above the Law, The Matrix, Iron Monkey, Ip Man, District B13, and my personal favourite of all time, Brotherhood of the Wolf. I thought I'd seen the best and worst of martial arts and then, a friend of mine told me to catch this flick. He said it was good, but little did I know what I was in for.<br /><br />YOU WON'T BE DISAPPOINTED!!!! That's all I have to say. If you love marital arts, non-stop action, minimal story, and to be blown away, this is for you. Not going to even give you a brief synopsis. Let's just say that the Raid 2 is out next year and it starts 2 hours after this one ended. If you see this movie, imagine what they would need to do to top it. That's how good it is!!!!!!!!!!
B0066WJLU6|4.0|I think ot works just great! I especially love that you can change the Color of the light! HOW COOL! :) I am using it on my kindle fire and I have had no adds so far at all. I have been wanting a flashlight app for my kindle and I have found it.
B00DUGCLY4|5.0|It's very fun and challenging at times I love the game and it has all my fave emojis:)!!! I PLAY IT A LOT
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a great game. Had a lot of fun finding all the clues and seeing where they lead. Wish it were longer with more rooms but liked the game nonetheless.
B00CS65QGW|5.0|Great dance tune. Lyrics are funny and a bit risque, but overall a fun song from adults. Takes me back to the old school days of disco. Sounds like the band enjoyed making this song too.
B008383GE8|4.0|Although I will never understand the maths and physics needed to truly understand quantum physics and cosmology, this book explains in language I can understand the big picture view of the universe that only maths can explain in detail.<br />If you have read Steven Hawking ‘s A Brief History of Time you will enjoy this book.
B005NFVZTM|4.0|One of the better x-men movies.  Good acting, great story, good special effects, and in general a well done movie.  Magneto was a really cool character.
B004J64QSI|5.0|I bought this as a gift and was very pleased to see it is Brand New like stated.  Thank You.
B00B22ASUM|5.0|This book is one I just couldn't put down.  Whether you are an animal lover or not this story will draw you into the lives of James and a special cat named Bob.  An amazing book about a man's journey in life and how a cat helps to show James his life has meaning and importance.  \\"Thank you James and Bob for sharing your story with us.
B001C4AFOY|5.0|I bought this as a gift and was very pleased to see it was Brand New like stated. Thank You.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|It is not what I was expecting - at all. It was fantasy and magic and mystical. Part Harry Potter and part Nannie McPhee...well, kind of. It is a  very thoughtful and meaning-packed book. No, adults don't always have the answers. Answers are in the pond...the ocean at the end of the lane. Read this. Very well written.
055358202X|4.0|Although there is much to critize about the book, I actually liked it.  It is not as good as the first three books in the series, but had some interesting things to say.  I enjoyed getting to know things about Cercei, Jamie, Samwell and Brienne from a more intimate perspective.  At first, I was annoyed with the introduction of new characters, but once I sorted them out it was interesting, especially learning about the Martell's (the Red Viper's group).  Is the book overlong, bloated, and really dosen't move the story to much forward?  Yes.  Does it spend to much time on a few characters, and not on the overall story?  Yes.  And I think where Arya was placed in the story is strange.  The book could have been edited down by several hundred pages.  But, I have invested time in the books and the HBO production, so what's another 1000 pages in this wonderfully crafted world.  I do hope GRR Martin stays alive long enough to complete this series.  He needs to hone in on wrapping things up soon.
B009XIXVU6|3.0|The storyline was unrealistic and I found the ending too predictable. It's good but not great. Wait until it's discounted.
B002W7J3SO|3.0|Not quite as compelling as some other Hitchcock fare (Rear Window, Psycho, The Birds, etc.) and the special effects sadly don't travel as well in time as plain old suspense.  But Cary Grant and Saint are very good.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|There are individuals on Amazon that \\"review\\" without ever reading the book.  These people make 10 cents per review and live a sad life.  There have been articles done on this before, just be aware.  You cannot trust all reviews on here.  I would only pay attention to those that seem to have truly read the book.<br /><br />Saying the author should not have the ability to write a story based on his research of the individual Jesus is ridiculous.  If your faith was as strong as you say, why do you need to challenge a book?  Does a book really have the ability to make you questions YOUR beliefs?<br /><br />Sounds like someone needs to go to Church to get some convincing... ;)
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Oh how we love this show... We started late so we've had to catch up and it's been great fun. We have WD marathons and get all wrapped up in this world.  Walkers in our dreams & all... Awesome show!
B008XX6J4C|5.0|They can make even the most trite pop song sound like genius and the most classic symphony piece sound new again...my ears can't get enough!
B00BM1AJIO|5.0|This has to be one of the best games for Kindle Fire I have played. The graphics are splendid and the adventure was challenging but not impossible! I recommend highly and hope to find another one like it soon.
B003XF1OJK|4.0|This book is simple yet appealing. Having never played the halo games I found the storyline entertaining. Once I started reading I couldn't put it down.
B00CDY6HW6|5.0|+++++ Update 8/2/13 +++++<br />Very fast response from devs after last (non-working) update...they fixed it and released (working) update within 24 hours...seems to be working great again...so good to hear the little bunnies \\"yippie\\"! Game is amazing, worth a couple of bucks for hours of puzzle entertainment.<br />+++++++++++++++++++++++++<br /><br />**** UPDATE ****<br />Received response from devs about new version (V1.0.20 - bug supposedly fixed)to be in stores within 24 hours - will dl as soon as available and post update.<br />****************<br /><br />I have been completely addicted to this game for the past 3 days - playing non-stop. Great graphics and so cute! The first levels are obviously way too easy, but it gets more challenging later on (especially in the later worlds, when dealing with rockets, parachutes and other cute bunny accessories). In later worlds it was challenging enough even for me as a seasoned puzzle lover and I had to try quite a few times before being able to solve some of the levels.<br /><br />One - HUGE - problem though, out of nowhere the game stopped working today. Reloading did not help either, it brought me back to a brandnew game (had to start over at level 1, which I would gladly have done) but yet had the same \\"BunnyMania 2 stopped.\\" error message as soon as I tried to hit any action button after the start of a level.<br /><br />Sent an email to the company but haven't heard back yet. So - would be careful buying it today, there definitely is a bug in the game as of today - hope it didn't hurt my Kindle.
B004U8VWLE|5.0|I love Natalie Portman. She acts flawlessly in this film. Is it so beautiful to the eye. It is haunting and tells a great story of  a ballerina gone bad (mentally). A must see.
B000AQJPQE|1.0|Stopped working after minimal usage.  Swapped out all batteries in the remote and the ceiling-mounted unit itself with new ones, still didn't work.  Ordered a new, replacement remote from the UncleMilton.com website ($6.99 + shipping = about $10 total), put in brand new batteries, unit still didn't work.  Wrote Uncle Milton customer service an email yesterday explaining the situation and  requested that it either replace the solar system unit or refund my money. This is what they wrote back: \\"We are sorry the remote did not operate the Solar System.  There are two different models.  Please be sure that the correct one was shipped to you.\\"  Seriously? Yeah, I would have noticed if the remote were different; it is identical. How about the truth - the product is shoddily made and shouldn't cost more than $5 as that's the value of the entertainment it provides to your child for the short-lived life you can expect of it. Won't be buying their products again.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Love the game, except for one big glitch - when it decides to freeze up or say &quot;connection error&quot; you lose your tokens you used for that game! It puts a major damper on all the ones who paid for their tokens. Also, sometimes the word/names with blur out due to game glitching out. Please fix errors and game will be perfect =)
B00D2K40WY|4.0|This game is fun for any girl. And it's hard to stop I played it till 2:30 in the morning i love to do her makeup and hair
6304698798|3.0|Many people love this film, but in reality it is bad-  the pace moves very slow & i found myself yawning a bit; the over dubbing is terrible;  the historical aspects are inaccurate (cartridge revolvers did not exist during the civil war, which is used as a plot backdrop). but director Sergio does an okay job with using screen cutting/editing dynamics to help intensify mood & suspense, and it is interesting how he would have the dichotomy of sweet melancholy music playing during violent scenes. but another reason this film is not so good is the characters are not particularly likable except for eastwood. he is thee only reason to even watch this! i also love him in his non-western movies but i wouldn't suggest actually buying this one to own, but yes do take a few hours to watch it if you never have seen it, but do it on youtube!<br /> Sergio's other two eastwood westerns are better & have similar shortcomings but not as many as this one. i do in fact like the film's musical score however, and it seems to have become popular as a classic through the decades.  fans of eastwood's western movies  should buy High Plains Drifter or Bronco Billy if you havent seen those yet.<br /> buy Absolute Power or Play Misty for Me if you're looking for his non westerns, which he sought to improve or save his career by destroying that iconic hollywood cowbow image beginning in the 90s.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I've read the trilogy several times, got a non-reader friend into the books, and I eagerly await the other movies.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I can't believe I bought this thing. The buyer's remorse was instant. I'm 34 years old and bought a Lego Death Star. Is this what my life has come to? Spending hard earned paycheck dollars on plastic bricks? Whatever, dude! This is the BEST. TOY. EVERRRRR!!! I put it in my kitchen as a decoration. I like to crush the **** out of Lego Luke in the Lego trash compactor. Take that, maturity!
B0063IH60K|4.0|I needed a solitaire game to play when I had my Kindle and not my computer.  This one is good.
B000K4X5XA|4.0|...because &#34;Man of Steel&#34; was NOT a Superman movie. &#34;Superman&#34; is and will continue to be the reigning champ when it comes to Superman flicks. There's a refreshing element of nostalgia and idealism that is desperately needed in today's culture. Instead of the latest Avengers/Dark Knight copy-cat crap-fest that was MOS, check this one out and prepare to have a smile on your face for the duration of the film. Video quality is top-notch and the extras are enough to satisfy.<br /><br />I deducted one star for the fact that this is the extended cut of the film. I usually prefer the theatrical cut or an option to watch either. The Alien/Aliens Blu Ray releases did this correctly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is entertaining, fast-moving, and the best part is you don't run out of lives so many other games these days.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book was amazing!!! I didn't think it could top the first one but I was wrong! The theme of the Quarter Quell was totally unexpected. It threw everyone for a loop. President Snow is AWFUL!!! I can't wait to read the next book! Catching Fire is a must read!
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I started playing this when it was all the rage.  I enjoyed it, although I do not play it anymore.
B00E8G5HDW|5.0|THERE SO MUCH EPICNESS! This is the spoiler free review,so many epic moments,choreography and music,well animation. The first couple of seasons nd some episodes were meant just for kids and cringe worthy at some moments,but this is different,so don't base your opinion of the show as its for kids. This also includes special features and although its non canon the clone wars is still 11/10 and is a must buy for star wars fans. Don't miss out on action,music and story on a level only star wars can provide.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I enjoy this game and it's nice to be able to play it when I do not have my computer with me.
B00004TWZF|1.0|They sent me the big blue soundtrack CD instead of the DVD. Don't buy it it's not what you think!
B004SUWR2C|3.0|I got this because of my lifetime love of Uno, but I've never actually used this.  I don't intend to.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|I love good actors and this movie is filled with them...loved the subject matter also.  I found the movie very enjoyable.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app.  Challenging but not super difficult.  I couldn't stop once I started.  I have a lot of down-time for this at work so it helped.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|With all of the weights in, it feels perfect. It feels much better than my old Logitech mouse and is a great bargain. For the price, I'm more than satisfied.
B00CD4RPWM|3.0|It was just ok. Interesting o get an idea of what the characters looked like. I would rather read words than a comic book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|Fun and addictive to play ........ only down fall is if you run out of coins you have to wait or you can buy some
B00821PCJS|4.0|This is a completely watchable, if somewhat predictable sci fi series. It has been fun to watch for a family of sci fi nerds, although it is the people stories rather than the science content that carries the show.
B00005ASGG|5.0|this is a movie that will watched generations from now. This is a classic western the kind that goes on forever. John wayne,Jimmy stewartand lee marvin are perfectly cast for there parts even lee van cleff has a small part. The supporting cast did a fine job. If you havent seen it your missing out on a good western made like the old fashion westerns.this a john ford movie if you know of him he made the best westerns. The story is a bout a meek mannerd man who is a lawyer and trys to bring law to the west.but dosent understand that the gun is the law of the west. He finds out the hard way. I have watched this movie years ago and enjoyed it then as well as now .
B001O5LVPI|5.0|Purchased this Disney classic for kids and they watch it at least once a week...quick easy purchase..I will buy more!

B0083P1QUM|5.0|The Bone Bed was another classic Kay Scarpetta novel by Patricia Cornwell.  Cornwell's paint brush of words describe the surroundings of every site and person.  This novel is a pleasant involvement of all Scarpetta's primary characters: Benton, Marino, Lucy ...I read this on a Kindle, with no problems whatsoever.<br /><br />Enjoyable novel ... hungry for the next one!
B00506NRBS|5.0|This book reminded me at every turn of the wisdom of a refrigerator magnet I have.  It's a quote from the Dali Llama that says &#34;The purpose of our lives is to be happy&#34;.  I'm inspired to rethink a few things in my life, and that doesn't happen with too many books I read.  Great book!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was hooked from the first chapter.  I really enjoyed this authors previous two books and this one is just as good.  Every time I start reading this book, I find myself reading and reading! I am pleasantly surprised by this book.
B00340ESIS|4.0|I may never write a screen play, but I'll definitely look at movies and fiction differently after reading this.  Explains why I haven't liked so many of the big budget films I've seen, and what they could have done better.
B003N5VOUO|4.0|Rizvaan Khan has Aspergers Syndrome in India, and upon the death of his kind mother, he emigrates to San Francisco to live with his brother.

How could that ever happen?<br /><br />A long movie with some overly stylized subplots, but the acting pulls it through to a winning conclusion.
B005KD5UAW|3.0|Could use I little more change up and a bit more oomph in the lyrical department. but, over all, its a great buy.
B004T0XYM8|5.0|I agree with most if not all of those who have given this excellent movie a full 5 stars.  If it were possible on Amazon I would have given it more.  I have a large collection of movies and this one is easily in my top ten. Bronson and Fonda are amazing and so are many of the other actors.<br />Then there is Sergio Leone. I already loved his other films but did not really appreciate his mastery of film making until this work of art.<br />Enjoy!
0061743526|1.0|I bought this &#34;hardbound&#34; book as a 13th birthday gift for my grandson.  Noting the hype for &#34;50th Anniversary Edition&#34; I assumed this book would be published with quality binding and paper to make it worthy of being a commemorative item.  On the contrary.  The book has a cheap, plain cardboard cover with a paper jacket that was even scuffed on the edges.  The paper inside was common &#34;pulp&#34; paper that one finds in the lowest quality books.<br /><br />So to replace this book as my gift I bought the same novel at Barnes & Noble for just a few dollars more.  That book has a beautiful leather cover with engraved artwork and gold leaf pages with a ribbon bookmark.  Barnes & Noble sells it as a &#34;library&#34; edition.  It is hard to overstate the vast difference in quality between this book and Amazon.com's so-called 50th Anniversary Edition.  I don't blame Amazon.com, which just provides the venue for sales, but I hope my review puts everyone on notice that this book is barely better than a paperback.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|As an ACTION MOVIE this is pretty good entertainment but far below any bar of excellence.  I might watch it again in a few years as a rental, but would never buy it for a library.  A couple of the main characters I like, but the rest are not very interesting to me or perhaps even irritating from time to time.  Others, who are more enthusiastic about this fractional genre of fantasy/fiction, may really think this is great.  Would probably give it 3 1/2 if I could.
B005XDHNF4|5.0|We put this on the dessert at our son's rehearsal dinner. He loved it and is keeping it. A great idea and LEGO is the best!
B00BG5CXGM|5.0|When I first saw this case on amazon I knew from the start that this case would be mine. I just got it and it was in a plastic box, so great packaging. This case is very slim and strong as promised, great feel. Some people may have problems with headphones fitting in with the case on but I had no problem with that. My headphones fit perfectly and same with the charger. So all in all, great case!
140006922X|5.0|This is a book for people of all faiths who have a sincere interest in the historical figure Jesus. The controversy surrounding this book is not needed and any Christians who question its intent should really pick up this book. I, myself, am a Christian and love this book for many reasons. One, the hate surrounding this book should be a reminder to us Christians (and anyone else) that it is not our place to judge. Two, this book gave me a more cohesive understanding of Jesus. For me, it was easy to incorporate my biblical understanding and personal sentiments about Jesus with this historical understanding. I feel that it has actually strengthened my relationship with Christ and given me a better understanding for who he was. I definitely recommend it!
0756405890|2.0|This book and its sequel were bought for me by a friend who raved about how awesome they were.  I wanted to believe him.  I really did.  And the story almost had me going for a while... But then would crush my hopes and leave me disappointed.  I don't think I have the heart to read the sequel.<br /><br />The story starts off with a \\"mysterious\\" innkeeper, \\"mysterious\\" things attacking people, and no idea what is going on.  That's fine, except one chapter isn't even two full pages long, while others are at least ten.  The end result is awkward pacing.  It's not until Kvothe starts to tell his story that things really pick up, but bad pacing continues to harm the book throughout.<br /><br />Kvothe is a major problem in this book.  I see people saying he's unlikeable because he's arrogant, etc.  To me, this isn't the issue.  Unlikeable characters can be really interesting!  The problem is, their bad traits need to be properly addressed WITHIN the book as well.  Kvothe's are not.  He's arrogant, he's rude to people, he does stupid things.  What consequences come to him?  Nothing, basically.  Deadly stuff happens to him repeatedly and he survives, no lasting harm.  Everything falls into his lap, even when it clearly shouldn't.  He is musically perfect, magically perfect, and socially imperfect in a way that works out perfectly.<br /><br />This makes the story tragically predictable.  I knew what was going to happen most of the time, even if not in clear detail.  Unfortunately, there were also moments where the logical fall-out to these events did not happen, and for no clear reason other than Kvothe is special.<br /><br />The other major issue is, as I said, the pacing.  The story occasionally ducks back to the inn.  The problem is how it does so; at one point the main story is ended MID-SENTENCE and it switches to the inn.  Is this semi-realistic?  Of course.  Is it a good writing style?  Not at ALL.  All it did was make me want to either throw the book away, or skip that nearly 20-page segue.  Kvothe would also have a tendency of alluding to something, then arrogantly declaring it's not appropriate/important/interesting.<br /><br />Finally, I was hoping this story would show how heroes tend to be exaggerated.  They don't do all of the things they are claimed to have done.  A lot of it is embellished or added on in rumours.  People make up things or misinterpret them, even the heroes themselves.<br /><br />Maybe Kvothe was and that's why a lot of it seemed so ridiculous, but without giving away too much... Those things people claimed Kvothe did?  Those things NO PERSON should be able to do, magic or otherwise?  Yep.  He did them.  And that one horrible thing that supposedly happened that everyone talks about?  Hand-waved.<br /><br />So why two stars instead of one?  The world is very interesting, especially in regards to culture and magic.  There are moments where the pacing is well-done, the scenes are well-written, and things seem to make sense.  I had moments where I couldn't put the book down (this is why I shouldn't read at work).<br /><br />Overall, the novel has potential.  In the end, it squandered most of it.  If you pick this book up, don't go in expecting a masterpiece or great literature.  Go in expecting what it is: a first time novelist's first book.<br /><br />I hope you find this review helpful.  Happy reading!at nearly 20-page segue.

B00ALYY6ZA|3.0|The book felt like it was a course on the history of eating and how the author was convinced through scientific processes of what was the best method to reduce the weight.  I think that if the information before hand had advised me of this I would have been better prepared for the lecture series prior to getting to the point of telling me what to do.  I think that what has happened is that so often most writers want to prove that they are authentic and creditable that they need to prove how knowledgeable on a subject.  To be honest most people just want to get a brief history and then get directly into the &#34;how to do it&#34; section of the book.<br /><br />I did appreciate the information once I got to it but I was so hungry by the time I reached the real point of the book I couldn't prepare myself for the plan for at least two weeks.  Shame on me, but that is the truth!<br /><br />Note to writers...put the &#34;why, background, credits...&#34; in the back and outline the plan in the front.  Fat people are hungry and by the time we reach the point of buying yet another book to try to lose the weight for long term, healthy results we lose focus very quickly.  We need to be able to read the background material while we are preparing the well balanced meal and do not have our mind on our next high calorie, fat overloaded meal....just a suggestion.. :-)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Loved having this app but then the update came.  Was able to learn to deal with navigating through but now app has crashed.  Not happy about that.  Uninstalling &amp; reinstalling did not help.  Uninstalled &amp; moved to another weather app that works for my needs!

B009QA3VY2|4.0|Despite its hyperbole, this class critique cum romance has its charms, including a fascinating glimpse of how Forster saw the Stephen children (later destined to become Virginia Woolf and Vanessa Bell).
B009CPN2G8|4.0|Fun movie. Laugh and have some popcorn. Kids will love it and adults will also enjoy the little dogs with voices.
B00A9ET4MC|5.0|From beginning to end, it reads like a suspense novel. You just want to keep learning more. I could hardly put it down, so beautifully written, so dead on about race from the perspective of a young black woman. Loved this even more than Half of a Yellow Sun.
B000ICXQXS|5.0|I found some VHS videotapes in my uncle's vault and I found this movie, the tape was damaged beyond repair but I got curious due mostly to the two big name actors in it. I am glad I rented it. (watching it on Roku sucks, I finally could enjoy it on a smart DVD player)
B008JFUO0Y|5.0|This movie scared the #@!$ out of me. Well worth the remake and no campy B feel... this is not the Evil Dead you grew up on. I will not say what changes went into this version to make it work so well. But you if you gave this movie a pass.... re-think again. I have nothing but fantastic words for this masterpiece of horror. More horror movies need to be of this quality. If there was a way to give this more than 5 stars i would.

(&#34; why read the book when you can have opinions&#34; -Colbert )<br /> Jesus-freaks, FauxNews, and tea-baggers hate the book (or any fact base book), that's good enough five stars.<br />Of course, it's a fact that real Jesus is an American, lives in the south, votes for GOP, hates science, supports cutting taxes for the rich (or is it job- creators) benefit cuts for the middle class, gives middle digit to the poor, hates government (&#34;keep governments hand off my Medicare&#34;)  and hates Obama (&#34;I want my country back&#34;)
B00BX8PG4S|5.0|Great movie! It It kept me on the edge of my couch from the beginning to the end! Great characters and enormous tension!<br />There were couple of flaws that I would like to mention, but it did not spoiled a good impression. First of all, the scene in Greek and not Russian orthodox church is funny because of total lack of knowledge of Russia culture. Second, mentioning Gulag. It was Brezhnev time, not Stalin and naval officer could loose his rank but would not be sent to a prisoner camp. And..as always voices that suppose to be Russian performed by Romanians or Serbians at best. Al in all movie is very good!

B009NFHF0Q|4.0|I'm not even sure quite what genre I'd put this book in, but either way it is an interesting and imaginary read. It's not quite Harry Potter, but it takes the reader into an imaginary world. It's worth a second read and a deeper exploration. Could this be an allegorical tale?
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|What a great way to pass the time. Love it. Fun for the kids as well as adults. I can't stop playing
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The author does not fail his reader and once again takes us on a journey not easily forgotten. Very powerfully and brilliantly written. It's a tale that takes us straight into the heart of the culture. It's not as brutal of a story as The Kite Runner, but this one is not a fairytale either. Worthy read.
1781162646|5.0|I've been reading Stephen King since the 1970's. His older books had a beautiful story arc ... and this book follows that same sort of pattern. Yes, you know that the protagonist will make it through hardship and heartbreak and come out on the other side ... but the character development and scene development is why I like SK. This is a smaller book than his more recent books .. just the right size to develop and tell a good tale.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it soo much so does my daughter and son we love it we never put it down we play it all the time
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I absolutely adored this season which was chock full of activity!  It is difficult to accept the changes this writer imposes at times, but the twists and turns keep up the momentum.  Watching it as a video is intense, but satisfying.  Sometimes, it's difficult to put it away!  My husband grew just as attached as I was and we both look forward to future seasons.  It might be wise to review it just before the next season begins.  The special features add so much as well!
B00AAI7B7W|5.0|Worth the wait!! Such a great movie. The acting was amazing and much creepier than some of these slasher movies.

0375714839|4.0|What does Iran's Islamic revolution look like through the eyes of a child?  How does a child of war assimilate into western culture?  Hard questions which have no clear cut answers are addressed in Marjane Satrapi's graphic memoir, The Complete Persepolis.  Originally published as two works, Persepolis:  The Story of a Childhood and Persepolis 2: The Story of a Return, The Complete Persepolis gives readers a chance to experience Satrapi's moving, challenging, and at time's disturbing, account in one full memoir detailing her most tumultuous years.  The Complete Persepolis displays new cover art that coincides with the major motion picture release of the same name.  The Complete Persepolis does not offer a break within the text to show you where the first memoir ends and the second begins.  The story easily flows as though it was always published as one work.<br /> While the graphic novel format helps to make the  horror and brutality of revolutionary and post revolutionary Iran in the 1980's and early 1990's approachable, it does not tone down the emotion or oppression.  Satrapi's anger and the constraints of the society are tangible, giving readers an intimate glimpse of what life would be like if one were stripped of many basic rights.  Young readers without knowledge of the politics of the time period or the history of Persia (yes, Iran was referred to as Persia up until 1935!) will be confused by frequent name dropping.  Names of people (Che Guevara), political factions (Bolsheviks), and even religions (Zoroastrianism) will either serve to lead young readers on a quest to learn more, or deter them from finishing the novel.  Older readers with more polarized views on the subject at hand must be prepared to accept Persepolis for what it is: a memoir.  A memoir written by a woman who lived through the accounts detailed within.  It would be a shame for Satrapi's work to be dismissed due to its disregard for what is and was politically correct.  On the contrary, Satrapi's consistent disregard for authority she deems inept and for critics who may find fault in her stance is exactly why this book should be embraced.  There is an unabashed authenticity that makes this a refreshing addition to any library's collection of nonfiction work.<br />The Complete Persepolis is not without its faults.  The sheer volume of characters and settings in the story is confusing at times.  The graphic novel format does not help in this matter, for as characters grow and change, it is often impossible to recognize them if not mentioned by name.  It is this rushed, graphic novel pace that at once makes a difficult subject approachable, yet leaves the reader longing for a more complete understanding.  Some details seem to be skimmed over in places and then later brought to the forefront, leaving the reader to thumb back through to find context.  Some characters and relationships, as well, seem to drastically change without enough reason given for the reader to truly feel they have been let in on Satrapi's complete experience.<br /> It would be more beneficial for libraries to purchase Persepolis as it was originally published in the U.S., in two separate volumes, for the content of the two is appropriate for different audiences.  Persepolis:  A Childhood would be appropriate high school reading, even as part of the curriculum so long as the teacher is well prepared for many questions, explanations, and lengthy discussions (also probable parent protestations).  Persepolis 2: A Return should be saved for only the most mature of high school readers, due to its mature themes and often gritty and controversial subject matter.  It would be hard to keep young readers of A Childhood from wanting to continue with Marjane on her journey in A Return, but the sexual content and drug use need to be approached in a very sensitive manner.  One of the most disconcerting scenes is when Marjane is staying at her friend Julie's house and Julie is sharing stories of hersexual escapades:  \\"I've already slept with eighteen guys....at first we used condoms, but the guy feels less.\\"  It is clear that readers need to be mature and well educated on safe sex practices in order to see that what Julie is recounting as common behavior is actually extremely dangerous.<br /> Mature readers ready for an original experience and an inside look at a very private existence will devour The Complete Persepolis.  Readers drawn into Satrapi's world will be delighted to find she has published two shorter graphic novels, Embroideries (2006) and Chicken with Plums (2009) that will give more insight into the culture of Iran and the workings and emotions of people living within a closed off society.sexual escapades:  \\"I've already slept with eighteen guys....at first we used condoms, but the guy feels less.\\"  It is clear that readers need to be mature and well educated on safe sex practices in order to see that what Julie is recounting as common behavior is actually extremely dangerous.<br /> Mature readers ready for an original experience and an inside look at a very private existence will devour The Complete Persepolis.

B00AALHW6Y|5.0|Enjoy this CD so much. All of the songs are very good. Really rock to Wagon Wheel. Not really country to me.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I really enjoyed the first two, and couldn't put them down. I was less impressed with Mockingjay. I felt it was difficult to follow and confusing at the end.
B00CA3C1N4|4.0|Lovely little app, i like it very much indeed and my son does too, well worth having installed it :-)
B005DJREGQ|5.0|I started watching this and couldn't stop. Def a different sort of show, but basically a very realistic one! I am in my 30's with kids and was entertained.
B002YK8OKC|5.0|And this one does that. Parents, Grandparents and children like this movie. Nuff said.  Oh and really catchy theme song...
B000NQRE9Q|4.0|You cannot go wrong with the collection of Indiana Jones; therefore, I do recommend you purchase this for your movie collection.
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|I very rarely review apps, but this one deserves a glowing review! It's lots of fun and really makes you think. The only reason I didn't give five stars is due to the last levels being incredibly difficult for me. They were so complex that I couldn't complete them without hints, which the developer graciously offers on his website. It just got to the point that I was literally getting a headache trying to figure out the later levels, so that took it past challenging and enjoyable for me. Otherwise, I loved the game! It's definitely unique, and I recommend it.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I love the fifty shade series. this one had a slow beginning but the end was amazing! Definitely would read again!

B00B0X4PIO|5.0|Khaled Hosseini writes equally well from a male as well as female perspective! His knowledge of the countries and languages is seamless and used so appropriately. One feels the angst, emotions etc. and the lives of his characters are so cleverly intertwined. I look forward to his next book!

B006TF6WAM|5.0|I looked forward to getting back into the book every evening.<br />Even though the outcome was obvious, the journey was interesting!
B008KE3960|5.0|An absolute gem of a game on an otherwise limited app store. Amazon better allow lots more free apps like these or perish in the shadow of Google Play Store. Perfect for Kindle Fire (and other tablets).

B001NLKWLW|5.0|Was a tiny bit confusing at first till I realized the same story was being told in different time frames and it jumps from time frame to time frame- once I caught on I could not read this book fast enough or put it down! Was so sad when I ran out of pages to read!

B009YN2M7S|3.0|Most of the book kept my attention.  Nothing fantastic, but worth a quick read.  A bit predictable.  If you like his books, you will probably enjoy it.  Wasn't super thought-provoking or deep.  It's very Nicholas Sparks (which I typically don't read).
B001CTGQBK|5.0|Downloaded it for the kids of all people.  They are under 10.  I was 10 when this came out so wasn't expecting them to like it.  They absolutely LOVED it.  &#34;when can we watch it again&#34; was the cry.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The show is well done; story is spell binding.  Characters are well drawn.  I could watch them all in one day, but then I would not have any more to watch!
B0037VNX44|4.0|This film reminded me of D'Lovely, starring Kevin Kline:  I wasn't expecting fantasy sequences and heavy metaphors.  sometimes that works (Terry Gilliam comes to mind) sometimes, not so much.  In the case of a notorious prisoner, I expect narration, and humor, which I got.  I wasn't into the breakaways to Bronson on a stage a la late 19th century variety show.  however...<br /><br />the acting.  oh my, was it stellar.  if tom hardy had to present only one film to showcase the entire range of his skill, this could be it.  just as a classic rock album can be characterized by several different kinds of songs (e.g., Queen's 'a night at the opera' or the verve's 'urban hymns'), Hardy's enduring performance is characterized by its intense highs and gentle lows.  Unlike Russell Crowe, whose lows remain tense, Hardy is utterly believable as the simultaneously volatile and violent/gentle and affable, simply crazy overall, Mickey &#34;Charles Bronson&#34; Peterson.  I found myself forgetting sometimes that I was viewing a portrayal; I guess I can thank the stage sequences for bringing me back to reality ;-)<br /><br />And on that note, while I don't prefer this style of film, I will say that I understand the purpose of the whole vaudeville breaks in the context of Mickey Peterson's story.  It was the one big, cheek slapping metaphor that any thinking film goer could understand, so definitely appreciate that, even if I don't prefer it.<br /><br />I recommend it.

B00BBI9WD6|5.0|These early Honor Harrington stories are better then the newer ones.  She is still fresh and exciting.  The forces facing off with her are believable.  David Weber always has a vision of war in the future that rings true.

B0080SZ0V8|5.0|Great fun and wonderful graphics. The difficulty level was just hard enough and it yet doesn't get you too frustrated. The clues at this beginning of each new page was very helpful. I would not recommend this for children under thirteen years.

193413712X|3.0|This is a carefully wrought piece of highly poetic prose describing the experience of an old man, George, dying in his bed at home, surrounded by his family.  Over a span of a few days, George's mental process gradually fragments and floats back to his childhood. The author compares this process to descriptions of George's hobby, repairing antique clocks.  Using clever excerpts from a fictional 18th century book, \\"The Reasonable Horologist,\\" the author expands the clock imagery into an elaborate, Tim Burton-like tableau. From there, and most importantly, the author uses George's clock/death process to move into the story of George's epileptic father, Howard, working as a tinker, selling his wares in rural Maine.  As Howard's sideways, supercharged mind encounters nature as a surreal temptress, the author is able to disgorge a  tapestry of imaginary Maine in the early twentieth century. Howard's meanderings make the suffocating process of George's clock/death seem almost secondary, just as the \\"plot\\" of this novel, is secondary to the incredibly language abilities of its author.<br /><br />This novel demonstrates deep thought and top-tier poetic ability.  However, it does not invite real engagement from the reader the way a well-told story ought to. Frankly, if it were longer, I might not have finished it. The characters are too alien to inspire any empathy, and there is no sense that the author cares about them as anything more than vehicles for puzzle-box meditations on the meaning of everything. Having just finished Denis Johnson's \\"Train Dreams,\\" in which the story and the poetry blend together beautifully, I was acutely aware that this novel was missing something. Roland Barthes talks about authors acquiring a certain \\"grain\\" in their storytelling voice that gives it character. This author has a cold, over-crafted, Iowa Writing School voice that screams talent without communicating much else. Maybe if Harding took some time away from Harvard to tell stories around the campfire, he would find a more connected tone.nd the campfire, he would find a more connected tone.

B001XUT6AG|5.0|Nicholas Meyer made the 2 best Star Trek movies: Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan and Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country. They are both well-written, well-directed, hilarious and dramatic. My favorite thing (besides Shatner absolutely crushing it in both movies) are the sexy Vulcan women. Kirstie Alley in Khan and (yowza) Kim Cattrall in Undiscovered Country are both sexy and smart and just plain hot in their performances. Holy cow, I love Kim Cattrall so much, she is amazing, I don't know why more people don't think so, she is one of the finest women ever! Love this movie!

B009FZHYKU|5.0|I find the storytelling in this series to be super compelling. I just flew through the 3 seasons, and cant wait for the 4th to start.
B00B70MMG2|5.0|The first season starts off slow, but you will quickly find yourself rooting for the Crawleys, and the servants!  The first season starts with the sinking of the Titanic, and the second season is a great display of how the world war affected the very richest and poorest.  The third season made me cry my eyes out, but I am still coming back for more!  Thanks PBS and Amazon!<br /><br />(Many people have given poor reviews because they claim Amazon has shortened the episodes by 3-9 minutes.  This might be true, I am unsure, as I have never watched any of the episodes on PBS, only Amazon.  But I can tell you, I didn't think the episodes were lacking at all!)
B00BB8OHMW|5.0|Shakespeare wasn't some highbrow intellect planning to destroy weekend fun for future teens! There was a reason his plays were popular in his day and have endured for centuries. This movie shows Shakespeare as a living, breathing, passionate man. It brings to life the play Romeo and Juliet (the play within the play) and is so well acted by so much of the cast. We have seen this movie twice, and loved it both times. We should own it!<br />*There is partial nudity and adult content.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|While not quite what I was expecting, still a very well written book and a good ending for the series.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Downloaded this on my Nook. It will keep you going. Had a hard time putting it down once I started reading it.<br />I really like the work from this author.<br />Love it! Love it!

B00DFFI7K2|3.0|First of all this type of movie doesn't have to be factual it's a fantasy and the more action the better.<br />The first movie gave you lots of action and special effects such as the cool suits they wore that gave them super speed and strength also the cool looking jet powered helicopters / cool jet's/ submarines and also the secret base in the desert.<br />I was totally let down by this movie as it portrayed the joe's as just another special forces team none of the cool gadgets of the first movie.<br />I still gave it three stars because it was still a decent action movie / but hey lets get back to the cool futuristic gadgets of the first movie I hope they try again and get it right<br />I love the Rock and Bruce Willis lets give them something better to work with

B003E88TKS|3.0|Movie was ok, glad I didn't fork out a lot of money to see it in the theatre.yada yada yada.
B0060V1WJ6|5.0|Carell, Bacon, Stone, and Gosling. what else do you neeed? Best movie ever! cutest guys ever a must see people
B007P7UF0G|5.0|I have enjoyed this movie for years. I ordered this to have a dvd version, already have a copy of it on vhs.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|A pleasant movie.  Nice to see a movie about older people.  Maggie Smith could read the dictionary out loud an still be enjoyable.
1936608618|1.0|I have not read this book. I saw brian McKenzie is the author and I thought \\"o that crossfit guy who made all these ridiculous claims and failed every marathon there after that claim?\\" For those of you who don't already know, brian claimed General crossfit wods would prepare anybody for a competition marathon. He said he would film a documentary and be the evidence. The only thing he proved is it doesn't work. I have no idea what he wrote in this book but because of his epic fails, I would not take advice from him. Google it. For that I gave one star.
B004X4R49Y|5.0|First time I have ever been impressed with Colin Firths acting.  I have seen most of his film, and do enjoy his roles, but he has always been rather predictable.  Not only did I enjoy this movie very much, and it was also interesting to learn snippets about the royal famlly during that period.
B00992CF6W|5.0|If I could rate 100 stars I would. So fun and worth buying. It's better for iPod than for kindle fire tho. I like the new realms.
B00BU987C8|5.0|Kendrick was how the west was won again. He brings back that lyrical flow that only several emcees from the west possessed  (Ice Cube, Kurupt, Ras Kass, Quik just to name a few). And with only two guest appearances Dr. Dre & M.C. Eiht he shows that he can hold his own. Production is superb without the help from Dr. Dre. And I love the fact that he has been with Dr. Dre for years but told him that he was not ready to be released until he perfected his flow and style.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is one of the best ever, and it's FREE!  My sisters and I love it.  The graphics are good quality (and adorable!).  You never get bored with it- there's always something or somewhere new to explore.  It gets kind of addicting... but in the best way possible.  You should get it.  Like, right now.  It's free, so it's not like you have anything to lose... trust me.  It's the bomb diggity.  Good luck and have fun!
B0012GTZC0|5.0|I first read this book back in the 80's. It was so well written that it continues to haunt me today. I've compared many authors to this standard. Few have measured up.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book catching fire is as good or better than the book the hunger games I want to desperately read the third the mocking Jay I can't wait for the second movie to come out I watched the movie after I read the first book I feel like I'm katniss when I read the books I feel like I'm out in her position I like how she figures things out i would have never figured out that the arena was a clock I love your books thank you very much  Lexie
B004HWYTP4|5.0|I rarely watch movies more than once, but I would watch this one again! Humorous, intelligent and action-packed. (Just forget the age difference and enjoy the movie! He doesn't look old anyway! lol)
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a cool game. It more fun than temple run and I love  that game. I like how it makes it so difficult.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I would like to see more characters to drive the cars. Seeing the same one gets old. If there were more characters, I would play the game more often.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Greater book couldn't put it down. I want a Travis in my life....he sounds yummy...I hate that Abby was stupid to play dumb n hard to get when surely enough Travis loved her.
0307387178|4.0|The book is very interesting, but I don't like the fact that Krakauer spent so much time discussing his adventures and got away from the story of this man.
B00AYM6JFO|1.0|Willie should stick to what he does best and leave the ballads to Tony Bennett.<br />This was a real disappointment.<br />Maybe it's time for retirement?
1401307450|3.0|I bought this book for my 16 year old.  I did not realize that it would contain graphic pictures and writing.  Fortunately, my child discussed this book with me.  We have pegged it as a &#34;how not to live your life&#34; book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The third season of Downton Abbey did not disappoint and was every bit as captivating as the first two seasons.  I dragged out watching it as long as I could knowing that Season 4 is still a long way off.  I didn't like how the last show in the season ended, but will say no more for fear of spoiling it for others.  Can't wait for Season 4!!
B00CHIMG6Y|5.0|This movie had all of the right elements. Drama,action,I don't want to say too much and give the plot away.
0345529057|5.0|If you have not heard of GOT, you have obviously been living under a rock for some time.  I recently subscribed to HBO and got hooked on the TV series so i purchased these to get more of the back story.  I would highly recommend this series if you enjoy the TV show.  There is so much the show leaves out, this helps fill in all the blanks!
B008Y73940|4.0|I really enjoyed this one,great actors,slick dialog. snappy courtroom action. One of the better John Grisham movies. I would definitely recommend this.
B00CL0J99K|5.0|Awesome movie!!! RDJ is hilarious. The action is amazing!!! Better than I thought it would be a must own marvel rules!!!
B004NELBPC|5.0|I get the news with out some one telling me what I should think! I just want the facts with out the bias and I get that with this app.! It works on my kindle with out any problems.
B007STBUIW|5.0|Excellent picture! I was very surprised at how good the picture was. If you were a fan of Jaws, this blu-ray will make you fall in love with it all over!
B00CWQAFT6|5.0|Ok - if you are looking for a well produced album, with amazing vocals, killer riffs and catchy hooks, look no further.  This album kicks major rock n roll behind.<br />I found it by accident and am now playing it on heavy rotation.  Well worth the $8.99.  Buy it! You wont be sorry.  Too bad the signer doesnt have anything else like this, i would buy it in a heartbeat.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I've had it for about 4 months now. I like, I love it, I just wish it had a battery indicator. Seriously....how hard would that be to integrate? O_o lol<br /><br />UPDATE May 1st 2014<br /><br />It's still working :) - I've only had to replace the batteries a few times.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good brain teaser, really makes you think.  Writing a review is the only thing I don't like. Otherwise not to bad.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I stumbled upon this app totally by accident; so glad I did!  Have thoroughly enjoyed solving the puzzles in order to escape from the rooms.  Love it and would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a good puzzle.  Enjoy!
B008K6HN8I|3.0|This used to be my favorite app. It let me open my camera on the kindle. Since the update its totally confusing.
B007DIQC90|5.0|The CD came to me on time, in perfect condition and the band is wonderful.<br /><br />The only thing is that I didn't know it was a cardboard case instead of a plastic (which I kinda like because it doesn't break as easily)
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|for all you haters out there get a life gees.but you should get it try it out ill bet you like it
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Very realistic characteristics in the horses and how they move. Very entertaining. Also a very fun game to play for all ages.
B0052RE4MQ|5.0|I really loved crossed :) it was so good and it made me desperate to read reached!i would definitely recommend reading the second book in this series
B0064X7FVE|3.0|If you can give me back the first weather app, I'll really appreciate that. I shouldn't never downloaded any other no matter if it could be something new.  This app is like &quot;eating&quot; my Kindle' s battery.  It's unbelievable!!!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|So grateful that I can access this on Amazon Prime! I've had no issue streaming the content and have sincerely enjoyed this third season. Amazing that it's so interesting and captivating in a culture where most shows revolve around crime and death. Keep it coming!
B005T87QCI|5.0|This game is definitely worth the money it takes to buy it. It has all the characters and more you can unlock about half of the characters the rest you have to buy.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Absolutely addictive show! The ending of season 3 is disturbing, though. Sure would've hoped for a different outcome. Hoping that there will be another season.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|Kept my attention the entire time. I was taken by emotion in many chapters. A book that makes you feel emotion, in my opinion, is  always worth the read.
B000VI6T6U|5.0|If you're looking to get into Jimi Hendrix, this is definitely the place to start. It was the first U.S. performance for Hendrix since heading over to the UK to form the Experience. This was the show that basically made him an American household name. Not to mention it's famous for its conclusion, in which Hendrix sacrifices his guitar in a fiery display.<br /><br />As for the DVD itself, it is a great product. There is a 20-minute long introduction in which topics such as the discovery of Hendrix, the formation of the Monterey Pop Festival, and his return to the United States are covered. It provides background for the show, then launches straight into the set. The camerawork here is phenomenal, not suffering from the extreme closeups that many complain about in the Woodstock footage. The show itself is only about 40 minutes long, but it is 40 minutes of pure rock excellence. The songs here are pretty compact, at least compared to the extended jamming seen in other performances like Woodstock or Fillmore East; however, I think this actually benefits this particular performance, keeping it tight and fast-paced.<br /><br />Overall, this is a must-have for any Hendrix fan. It's also a great starting place for new fans, as it shows all his exciting showmanship while also displaying some excellent guitar work. Either way, you won't be disappointed!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game it's fun and changing me and my son both play it we like all the characters I recommend this game to everyone I know
B0013LL2Z2|5.0|I made my Mom take me to see this movie on the opening night and several times while it was in theaters. This is the first time I've seen it sense. As far as I know this is Farrah's first film and it came out when her famous red bathing suit poster was everywhere.The story is really good. The mall like setting is so funny and the costumes are kind of a modern take on Roman loungewear. I highly recommend this movie to anyone especially Farrah fans!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I choose a 5 star rating because of how amazing this book is i have read it so many times and<br />it never gets old!
B007VUA7VO|5.0|love the easy interface and auto display after charging.  great simple app.  best of all its free!  keep up the great work. wish my android had the auto display
B0063M22QO|5.0|Good game and graphics. Keeps the classic look and feel. Really enjoy it. I could sit and play for hours
B003M70O5O|5.0|Very good show win awards. Great acting. Good writing Needs more air time.  Just a little problem with the story line. I don't want crime to \\"seem\\" to be profitable
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I love the way they keep time moving ahead.  So much better than the melodramas of other current dramatic series.  And they give Maggie Smith the BEST lines.
1932100660|5.0|This book provides a comprehensive look at various types of foods and their impact on our health. Everyone one should read this.<br /><br />Some of the reviewers here make a distinction between causality and correlation; well, so does the author. Campbell devotes a long discussion to precisely this issue, highlighting the difficulties and justifying his claims.<br /><br />The negative reviewers also question Campbell's objectivity in his interpretation of evidence. However, as he states in his book, he grew up on a dairy farm and later, as a young lecturer at university, he openly mocked vegetarians.<br /><br />Thus, if he had any initial personal bias, it was against his findings. However, because he was able to be objective, he changed his opinions and perspective precisely because of the results of his research, and not vice versa.<br /><br />This is a great book that everyone interested in healthy eating should read. Regrettably, some of the critics here don't appear to have done so. They should.
B002HFP0QU|1.0|This CD is fabulous....I play it constantly and am thrilled that i purchased it. It is the BeeGees at their best.
B000I9X53W|5.0|AOMEONE SAID THEY SEE IT EVERY TEN YEARS. I BOUGHT IT FROM AMAZON SO NOW I CAN SEE IT WHENEVER I WANT! CHEERS ALOT OF PEOPLE UP IN BAD TIMES. ADORE DUSTION IN THIS AND MANY OTHER MOVIES, BILL MURRAY DITTO, Jessica Lange was wspecially great in this.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app is probaly the best time consuming game if i am waiting in a long car ride i would put on music and playthe game for like 1 or 2 hrs but the thing is when you enter tue gane there is  this app and sometimes it freezez but over all i think its a 5 over 5
B008D36INE|1.0|Please,a true drag.Acting ok but story useless. Glad when it ended. Tip-Don't bother.What more can I say.<br />Bore. Bore. Bore!!!!!
B000FC1HBY|3.0|It was disjointed compared to the first book. I was on the whole disappointed . It seemed like the author was struggling to keep up the  rhythm from the first book. Some chapters were clearly better than others. Certain characters  did not generate engagement from the writer. I was most disappointed in the character of Bran. Martin clearly made a mistake in the way he ended Bran's character and then tried to revive him in the last chapter. It was confusing and a little embarrassing as a reader.
B00498YZH8|4.0|true indie at its best. Everyone was so real- story excellent- above all Jennifer Lawrence (whaT WAS SHE 17?) WAS SUPERB-PITCH PERFECT. SHE INTRODUCED US TO THE NEXT MERYL STREEP. AND SHE'S SO REAL AND FUNNY ON UTUBE (ADMITTEDLY NOT THE POINT OF THIS REVIEW). HER [ERSONALITY SHINES THROU HER PERFORMANCE. BRAVO!!!!
B000QCS8TW|4.0|This was fast moving and engaging and had a large array of characters that were not one dimensional. It was a little too violent at times
B0090EHVMC|4.0|The movie was cute and I enjoyed watching it, but I wish they would have kept at least a portion of the Lorax's original speech in  the movie.
140006922X|1.0|Thought I would rewrite this review since my previous review on this garbage was pulled for some reason. Amazon should abolish commenting on reviews. Fascism at its best I guess.<br /><br />A complete work of false prophesies by a radical author that has a degree in writing fiction, and trying to write his own religion.....go figure. Very frightening people get sucked into this, this is how cults are born.
B005GY0Y8S|1.0|This is one of the most poorly written books I have ever read.  It was full of non sequiturs and padded with trivia.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|cool game. wish you could do more. fun though. It was free and worth it. good for little kids. ok
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed watching season 3 of Downton Abbey (as well as season 1 and 2).  I particularly enjoy &#34;period&#34; dramas so this type of series is right down my alley.  I really like the way the producers focus on the stories of the Crawley family and the service staff equally. Interactions between the men and women is respectful and appropriate.  It is also very nice to watch a program that does not contain profanity and vulgarity.  Overall great series!  I am looking forward to season 4!
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|I love marvel action comics and the story is not always about the saving of the world or country it is about the man behind the mind
1449410243|5.0|bought as give for my girl friend, she was very amused. I new those cats were up to no good
B00CDY6HW6|1.0|I was disappointed in the graphics and lost all interest in pursuing the next level. Hope to see other apps from developers, and good luck with apps.<br />Dezeki.free
140006922X|5.0|I have read other books on the historical Jesus, but often hoped for more accounts on the everyday lives of the people in those days. This book fills that gap perfectly. You will read a lot of side information about the political and sociological framework that Jesus did his teachings in in 1st century.<br />Disregarding the obviously useless 1-star reviews, this book deserves the 4+ average it gets here.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|As much as I love it, but it would be great if jewels were also awarded in treasure chests periodically, like the income generated by the habitats. The app has been freezing and progress lost, but returns if you log into Facebook and don't log out. Your game will come  back in a day or two.  The dragons should develop special powers that help with certain goals and progress.<br />  Great game.<br />Dezeki.free
B006S08RLU|5.0|Movie was recommended by someone which is the only reason we would have watched a film with the description of this one.  It was very entertaining from the very beginning, and we were engaged and thoroughly enjoyed the whole thing!
B00125WAWS|5.0|The item received is just what I ordered. I liked the movie very much and would recommend it to anyone who likes watching Denzel Washington.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I wish I didn't have to leave a review but the game was fun. I liked the puzzle solving aspect.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I think this has been by far the most emotional season of Downton Abbey yet. There were happy moments to be sure but I cried more often! I can't wait to see wait Season 4 will hold for these people.
140006922X|1.0|I'm Messianic and someone who is literate when it comes to the Bible.  I also like to have my faith challenged since I believe that makes you a stronger believer if you have to defend it.  This is like arguing with a child, the arguments he presents are sophomoric at best, old, and redundant.  Most of ideas or, \\"findings\\" are actually easily debunked before my second cup of coffee in the morning and usually I need at least 3 to wake up. It was a bigger reflection on how moronic you can be and still get your PhD.<br /><br />If you want something that challenges your faith, that makes you soul search, do research and think, listen to anti-missionaries (orthodox rabbi's) like Rabbi Singer.  But these are people who have the Bible memorized in Hebrew, Greek, and English aka not this guy - he doesn't have a leg to stand on. If you want to see how NOT to make a case that Yeshua wasn't the Messiah and sound like and idiot in the process then use this book as your main resource for presenting a case with someone who is competent in both the Tanakh (O.T) and the Gospels - I'm sure it would be entertaining to watch.<br /><br />So it gets a 1 star, 1 star for nothing more then the biggest let down of a decent argument I've heard this year.  Trust me when I say, I'm not opposed to hearing arguments about who I believe the Messiah is, and believe when I say I've heard some ones that make you check scripture and really do some research, that's why I got the book; to be challenged.  This does not fill that void at all.<br /><br />Now if you just want to read something that backs up your arguments that's fine, but you might want to get a better argument then this one.  This reminds me of the, \\"God is not real because you can't see him\\".  Well wind can't be seen so I guess wind doesn't exists either then.  We're talking that level of argument...<br /><br />Shalom<br />~D

0316228583|4.0|I started Casual Vacancy the week it came out, and I'm ashamed to admit, I didn't give it much of a chance. I got around 30 pages in when I put it down and decided it was boring. I can look back now, and honestly say, that I probably was not giving it the proper attention that was necessary.<br /><br />You see, picking it up and reading it properly this time, I can see why I (and I assume many of the lower scored reviews), dismiss this book. There are about 17 main characters, and their points of views shift constantly, hardly ever staying on one character too long. On the 2nd read (which should be considered my only true reading of this book), this frustrated me to no end! At least at first. About a 100 pages in, every time I felt like I had a good grip on who was related to who and what they did, I got mixed up again and scolded myself for it. Then, because I'm so terrible with names, even in real life, I just wrote down all the characters and their family relations on a sheet of paper. I felt silly doing it, but I'm sure glad I did it.<br /><br />After I had the names down, this book became worlds better. It really is fantastic. JK Rowling sure has a knack for bringing characters to life with her words and making them multi dimensional. I think that may be another reason why people dislike this book. Everyone has things about them that are admirable, but they also have lots of horrible sides to them that can make a lot of them seem like a-holes. But that's what real about them. They're great. They're multi faceted. They have reasons for everything they do.<br /><br />The more you get used to the names and all, the better the book gets. In classic Rowling fashion, the last 100 pages are so crescendo with excitement filled, page-turning, awesomeness. I'm always in awe of her writing when I finish a book. She always managed to wrap everything up nearly flawlessly.<br /><br />This book should have been reviewed a lot better than it was. I think a lot of people had preconceptions of what it should be. And it's not that. It's an adult book, totally and completely. The themes are heavy and dark. Really almost too dark, (at times). The characters are gritty. The story isn't overly grand or epic. It's about a simple small town.<br /><br />Overall, Casual Vacancy is one of the better books I've read in a while and I truly enjoyed it. The last 100 pages or so had me tempted to review it as a \\"5-star\\", but I think it's a little closer to 4. Though, I wouldn't be surprised if it grew in my head over time into a 5.<br /><br />Check it out, but try and give it a fair shot.econceptions of what it should be. And it's not that.

B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This movie is very well done...with two main characters you can fall in love with.  One world...the gravity holds them down upright, with oil spills, poverty, and a general depressed theme.  The opposite world, directly on top of them...are wealthy.  The conflict over forbidden love is sweetly done.

Don't feel bad if your particular sacred cow is gored, all of our national identities deserve comic treatment from time to time.

B00A285OOW|2.0|Love Philippa's books and had greatly anticipated this one after reading the Kingmaker's Daughter but was so let down.  Hate the way it ended or rather just chopped off the story.  Seemed like Philippa couldn't think of an original way to write Elizabeth of York as a strong female character after already writing so many other strong females of the period so she settled for making her so passive and ineffective that this reader had a hard time sympathizing with her, much less rooting for her.  Could have been so much better.

B0015GF4FO|5.0|I'm enjoying watching the client/therapist relationships develop.  It's interesting to watch Paul and how he relates with them, and also with his own therapist.  I'm hooked!
B00DHNBPA6|2.0|This movie is both a tired rehash of every other cabin-in-the-woods horror movie (finally shot in the head by \\"The Cabin in the Woods\\") and a bizarre remake of a remake (without Sam Raimi or Bruce Campbell having anything to do with this one, besides a producer credit for each). It attempts to play the Evil Dead story completely straight, but its character moments are almost completely absent after the first 15 minutes, giving way to a blood-soaked gore-fest without any motivation.<br /><br />The story of a young woman trying to get off smack and haunted by family tragedy looked like it was going to be interesting, and I'm sorry the filmmakers abandoned it. The horrors they foist on us instead -- possession by insult-throwing demons, tripping over things in the woods, sexual dread, and severe but random mutilations -- seem like the kind of horror that occurs to people who have not actually experienced any real horror in their own lives (or who at least are not interested in taking a look at it). Without Raimi's manic sense of humor, it's all laughably thin.<br /><br />The two stars out of five that I've given this movie are for the energy with which the cast and crew pursue their poorly-motivated goals, and for the shamelessly borrowed bits of the original (remake of) \\"Evil Dead\\" that show themselves from time to time.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|This one isn't as good as the Kite Runner or A thousand Splendid Suns, at least so far, but still a good read.
B003G4W49C|5.0|So I got this book on my kindle since it was recommended as a good book. The beginning was mysterious and left on an edge. After reading fifty pages or so I started to realize that I am extremely fortunate. It had a deep moral. In addition to the meaning the book was filled with action, drama and humor. This hooked me on to sic-fi and now I can't stop. I am so excited for the movie!
B00BD62X14|4.0|A CD of sweet songs in French.  I bought this before my trip to Paris to get me in the mood.

B0084ANCBC|1.0|I watched the movie, so thought I would read the book. I'm sure when this was written, it was probably entertaining, but the old english was hard to follow.  The author would go  into  detail of a subject and would become tedious to read. I did not finish this book.
B0041LG08U|5.0|As others have said, this watch is much nicer looking than it appears in the picture. The band is a bit cheap, and I don't like the hollow folded links, but for the price I am very satisfied with it. Over the past couple of months I have purchased this watch and 2 Skagens, but this Seiko, paired with a brown leather band as suggested by several other people, is the only one that has gotten noticed and drawn compliments, especially from the girls in the office who think it's beautiful. I also have a blue and grey striped Nato band on the way which I can't wait to try out.<br /><br />It holds a charge for about a day and a half so you can get away with wearing it every other day and not need to set it which is nice for an automatic. It gains about 5 seconds per day which is completely acceptable to me. Outer bezel rotates very smoothly and the second hand can be set by pulling the crown out and putting a bit of back pressure on it. I read this will not harm the movement but doing so concerns me a bit as the second hand seems to make a clicking noise that I can feel through the crown. All in all a great watch for the price.
B00DC3DGSK|5.0|Its next to impossible to be a seriously into rhythm and blues and never have heard the name Buddy Guy for the last few decades. During the 90's blues revivals when a lot of younger musicians such as Johnny Lang and early John Mayer began carrying the blues torch, Buddy Guy was one of the last remaining people who'd lived the blues lifestyle. Came up with Muddy Waters,Howlin Wolf,John Lee Hooker and all the Chess greats and learned from them. Then after decades of plugging away starting getting all these special honors during when he was in his 50's. Somehow I never listened to his music. If you ever read my reviews, you know my feelings on the blues during that era. Well know that I understand the blues's intention,I am not mistaking its sentiments based on some of its listeners misinterpretations. In any case,its not easy to misinterpret the level of personality,attitude and sheer technique this guy possesses in abundance.<br /><br />  This double album begins both of their discs with two enthusiastically nostalgic numbers in \\"Best In Town\\" and \\"Meet Me In Chicago\\"-both strongly funk heavy blues with some amazing horn charts and a right on time rhythm. \\"Justifyin'\\",\\"Messin With The Kid\\" featuring Kid Rock,\\"What You Gonna Do Abut Me\\" with Beth Hart and the brief but potent guitar jam of \\"Rhythm Inner Groove\\" are all hot grooving funk fueled R&B with some amazing amped up solos from Guy. \\"I Go By Feel\\" has the cleanest organ/guitar breaks this side of Al Green and is lyrically very likely the manifesto of his whole musical ethic. Keith Urban shows up for \\"One Day\\",a really good linkage between sleek country and blues guitar at another kind of crossroads. \\"The Devils Daughter\\",\\"Whiskey Ghost\\" and much of the second disc such as \\"Evil Twin\\",featuring a spirit appearance by members of Aerosmith along with \\"Never Gonna Change\\",\\"All That Makes Me Happy Is The Blues\\",\\"Blues Don't Care\\" and \\"My Mama Love Me\\"-quite possibly the best \\"mama song\\" ever written go deep into Buddy's soul on everything from drinking to knowing the wrong kind of women.<br /><br />  Buddy Guy is a very very astute person. He makes no bones on this album about the fact he's definitely been around. Somehow or other,his life experiences haven't been forgotten among all his accolades over the years. Hes still very much Buddy Guy-a cool man with a whole lot of groove. Even the guest stars on this album are extremely appropriate. They all bring in something very personal of their own front and center. And they always step back a bit and led Buddy just told the floor as he truly deserves. Another great aspect about this album is Buddy's maintaining the \\"giving it back\\" attitude he's always had with younger musicians-often jamming with them in his own blues club. Here is is doing the same thing with more contemporary people-a couple of whom have themselves been influences,and showing them just how its done. His music may seem like its from the guts. And maybe it is to a degree. But Buddy Guy is a great teacher too. And understands his music and how it should work. And speaking for myself when I hear the blues on this album,it makes me want to dance and makes me want to smile.dy's soul on everything from drinking to knowing the wrong kind of women.<br /><br />  Buddy Guy is a very very astute person.

0374533555|5.0|Daniel Kahneman is one of the most well-regarded thinkers in economics today despite not being an economist, but rather a psychologist. This book covers all of the main results of his research, most of which was done with Amos Tversky.<br /><br />\\"Thinking Fast and Slow\\" covers many different ideas, but the thread that pulls them all together is this: the way that the human brain works causes us to make mistakes that a person operating according to economic theory would never make. Intuition and focused thought are the focus of the first part of the book; known simply as \\"System 1\\" and \\"System 2\\", Kahneman shows why people make snap judgments that often lead to less-than-optimal results.<br /><br />The second part of the book is about rationality and how humans improperly estimate the value of things. One of the big ideas of this chapter is WYSIATI - \\"What you see is all there is\\". That is the idea that if something is out of sight, it is unlikely to be considered in a calculation, even if it is very important. For example, consider how much you would be willing to donate to a place like the Humane Society. Certainly many people would be willing to donate a lot after hearing about the suffering of homeless animals. Interestingly though, if people are faced with information about the plight of another group, for example cancer patients, they are much less likely to donate to the Humane Society, because now they consider the plight of animals to be only a small subset of overall suffering, and thus will want to split their charity between different groups. What you see is all there is: if you aren't faced with comparing one option (donating to the Humane Society) with another (donating to cancer research) then your choice will be biased.<br /><br />The third part of the book discusses the relationship between the \\"experiencing-self\\" and the \\"remembering-self\\". Ponder this thought-experiment: Imagine that you are at the hospital and the staff there are going to do surgery on you. After the surgery they will administer a drug so that you will forget the entire surgery experience. How much would you be willing to pay for them to reduce the amount of pain that you feel during the surgery? Since you won't remember it, it won't feel like you felt any pain at all after the surgery. Would you pay to make an experience that you won't remember less painful? This chapter covers how people respond to this question and others like it.<br /><br />Overall the book is absolutely fascinating. I have not even scratched the surface of Kahneman's ideas; there is so much to learn in this book that is both interesting and useful that I must recommend reading it wholeheartedly. Get the paper book, not the ebook, and find time to read it. It is well-worth your time, whether or not you would normally read about psychology or economics.

B0089LOG02|5.0|I would have to say this is one of the best books I have read in a while.  I read about 2 books a week and I have read some really good ones but this one was beyond good.  I would recommend this book highly to anyone. I have never read anything by this author before but I immediately bought another one by her.  The story line is good one.  The book held my interest from the first page to the last.  The main character was portrayed very nicely.  All the characters where presently well. There were plenty of surprises.  The only complaint I have is it seemed like when she got near the end she speeded up the story almost like she may have just wanted to get the story over with.  It was not so bad that it really ruined it but maybe it just seemed that way.  I would give this book 6 stars if I could.

This is an amzing movie,it s kid friendly, halarious even for adults, and teens and there are not really any \\"bad\\" violins and the only \\"bad\\" violin is funny and really weird. Also Gru isn't even evil at all. Especially after he meets the girls. This is one of the best movies I have seen, so I want to watch the second one of Despicable Me! It was also a fantastic movie too.

Bradley Cooper did a good job as Pat but Jennifer Lawrence stole the show!<br /><br />I watched her in Hunger Games just because she's cute.  However, I cringed when I saw she would be playing a more mature role in Silver Linings, but I am hella glad I decided to give it a watch.  I'm pretty positive I fell totally in love with Jennifer Lawrence's character Tiffany.<br /><br />She was smart, witty, broken.  Just like all people in life.<br /><br />The story was brilliant and evoked more emotion than your typical rom-com.<br /><br />If you want to laugh, cry, hug your girlfriend or boyfriend, I'm sure you will be a fan of this movie.

It was a joy to read as the Nac Mac Feegles are joined by Tiffany's witch cohorts and others to defeat a particularly nasty opponent.
B00E8B1358|1.0|Childish plot, bad acting, should be marked for children only!<br />Amazon needs a 2 minute sample or trailer for the movies so adults can see what they are ordering before it is too late.<br />We couldn't even finish this dog..................
B0029LCJJS|5.0|I'm glad I watched it thru as a season rather than the original 1 week at a time.  Even though we know the historic outcome this portrayal of King Henry VIII and his court and wives mesmerized me.  The characters were well played with not so much of a british accent that I couldn't understand it.  Sets and costumes were amazing, a truly epic series.<br />One caveat, if you're a bit shy about nudity and sex, be forewarned.  It is quite graphic, but did not distract me from the storyline and after the first few episodes, I hardly noticed it.
B004EWGLKI|5.0|Awesome challenging and amusing. Worth reading if you like to read. I love books that take you on a path you haven't tread
B008CLI4N4|5.0|great show, box art is awesome, episodes are of a high quality, read the books first and i think you get more
B008UCJ7KO|1.0|I read the two books of this trilogy which were launched last year and the were ok. The author was supposed to launch thia third and 'last' one last december and did not. She reschedulled the book many times which pissed me off and most of the readers.<br />This book was a messy. First of all, the murderer wasn'y even accused, Eva has so many problems with her sex life scandal. Her roommate was totally lost in this book. He eas suppposed a gay and the end he os expecting a baby??? And Eva wants to share a place with Cary and Gidron, who is one of the 25 richest guy in the world? How come? I was about to stop reading it, nothing interesting, the aithor copying 50 shades all the time, the same problems, the same nightmares, but in the end of the third book, again, which was suppposed to be the last one, ( trilogy) she just ends the book and writes down a note saying the story of Eva amd Gideon must continue????? What is it??? Is she crazy???? I just felt ridiculus in belivieng in this lady called Sylvia Day!
B004ZRV3AU|5.0|Use the ice/boiling water method-works great, and about 7 dollars cheaper than Hobby Lobby for the same thing. Great product for crafty types.

B00AEBB86A|5.0|Mark Wahlberg rocks this role to the max! I loved him in The Italian Job and have continued to follow his movies. The Shooter is so well done. Kudos to the producers and director. I love this movie.
B00BWBHIUG|3.0|Game moves too slowly for older children, geared toward younger children and can be pricy if you use pearls to buy items.  Very colorful.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I loved these three books it is written so real that I'd think of different sections all the time. I couldn't wait to read more and was sad to see it end.
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|Among all the super heroes, my expectations were on how Hulk would be portrayed. After failures of the original Hulk and its reboot, I was wondering whether Mark Ruffalo would be able to carry the &#34;Incredible Hulk&#34; in his shoulders.. To my surprise, he exceeded my expectations.<br /><br />No need to give feedback on other characters, as they have proved themselves in their individual capacity. With every character been given an equal weightage and impressive CG works out well for first episode of The Avenger series.<br /><br />Would recommend to all who like good entertainment. Must watch if you are a fan boy of atleast one of the heroes.
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I am not a kid but the kid in me loved this. the adult was very happy to meet this gorgeous creature with the incredible voice and the inspiring songs she sings with such honesty about her daily life. I can't wait to see her as she grows even better with age and experience. I love Katy Perry and may the Buddha's keep blessing her.
B005CRQ3RK|5.0|I LOVE THIS book! I would love to read the next book and see what happens next! I,d love to recommend this book to every kid who loves to read these books. Calhoun_amber
B00DM0XXCM|5.0|This is a cute, if unoriginal, romance story. Where the film shines is in its concept and visual presentation. The physics may seem complex at first glance but they are seamlessly integrated into the story. This is one of my new favorite films.
B001NLKXK2|5.0|I am not even sure how I came upon this book,  but I'm glad I did, what a wonderful, insightful and truly inspirational book about a disease that sneaks up on a family and can totally blindside you.  My husband's family is living this first hand with the beginnings of Alzheimer's with his mom.  As I am reading the book, I'm like yes his mom has done this, yes she has said that, amazing how this disease takes over their lives and makes them so scared, alone and paranoid  - This truly is a horrible disease.  Lisa Genova is dead-on with this book, even if the character (Alice) is fictional.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|This is a fanrastic app if you enjoy doing different kinds of puzzles and don't mind the occasional hidden object hunt. There are several different kinds of classic puzzles and even a more difficult version of simon. The puzzle types repat on several levels, but get increasingly more difficult.  But have no fear. If you get stuck on one of the hidden objects puzzles, you can get a hint, at the cost of two minutes.  I am really not sure what the clock has to do with the game or what might happen if you run out of time, but it was still something that added to the game for me. I didn't want to find out, so the pressure was on.  If you have no problem with the hidden object puzzles, but don't enjoy or are just plain not good at one of the other puzzle types, you can skip them by &quot;using an orb.&quot; I took full advantage of the orbs on one type of puzzle that i just found tedious.  Did i mention that some of the puzzles get harder as you progress? Again, that just added to the drama of the whole thing for me. I found myself saying &quot;whew, that was difficult. I hope I don't see another one like that again...&quot; And then  I would, and I'd be all &quot;fine...bring it on you spectral painting dude, I got this!&quot;.  Great app. Presumably magic book will mean something for a sequel?
B004VMUS9G|3.0|Does the job just wish that the volume was a little louder. Other than that the app is great. More tones would be nice
B00847KFDS|5.0|This CD has pairings of Fogerty and other well known singers for each track.  Kid Rock/Fogerty's remix of &#34;Born on the Bayou&#34; is my favorite.
B009O2XY12|3.0|The game is fun but asks for money to buy bubbles and stops after a few plays and requires payment to buy additional games
B0026QC0TA|5.0|Must see movie despite being.dated. Lil man never disappoints in his delivery of being funny and entertaining. I watched it twice so i think its pretty good.
B00AX6KNOY|3.0|This movie will do if you wanta kill some time of your long boring day..Predictable twist but sort of good viewing
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I WAS TICKLED PINK WHEN I WAS ABLE TO PLAY THIS GAME ON MY KINDLE. I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH I HAVE PLAYED IT BOTH ON MY PC AND KINDLE. I CAN'T WAIT TO SEE THE OTHER ROYAL ENVOY GAMES ON KINDLE FIRE.
1419553429|2.0|Practice problems are so less. Sentence correction analysis is too short. Not worth spending the money on this book. Tips are not so useful
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate the latest update . Very confusing and not user friendly. Cannot find the forecast fot the next 36 hours may uninstall.
141659521X|5.0|The Last Man is a terrific read, faced paced and tense.  It certainly is one of the two or three best books Vince Flynn has written.  I am very stingy with 5-star reviews, but didn't hesitate in this case.  I found the prior book predictable and so boring that I had trouble finishing it.  Great to see a return to form.
B0085A9J18|5.0|I REALLY ENJOYED THIS MOVIE AND I WOULD RECOMMEND IT TO ANY ONE WHO ENJOYS WATCHING A GOOD MOVIE FROM TIME TO TIME. I LOVE THIS MOVIE!
B00DP3IESY|5.0|It was a great show.  The plot and sequence of unexpected directions kept me interested during the entire length of the movie.  I will watch it again!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I had great expectations, and was completely disappointed.  There was just very little story here, boring from page one to the very end.
B004SBQAN8|5.0|I love the cast in this movies. They make being a person from another planet great. Love the fact the he found try love. But sad he had to leave. Wish they would make a part 2. to show how they finish and he get the girl.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|I downloaded this for my daughter, but realized that while the game is free some content is not.  I normally buy her games so I don't get nickled and dimed.  Uninstalled the game
B009GX7IRA|5.0|My family watches NCIS almost everyday on TV if it is on.  This show is awesome is and I recommend it.
B00BMTX5IW|5.0|If you like a fusion of swing/jazz and contemporary music, you will love Caro Emerald.  She has a wonderful voice
B006LR0XLM|5.0|This app makes file sharing  a snap. The user interface, folder creation, uploading and downloading are highly intuitive. Dropbox has made collaboration on our project a lot easier by allowing the team to use the very latest data quickly and reliably. It's a great tool to assist with configuration management and keep everyone supplied with current working configuration.
0937381888|5.0|One of the best purchases you can make.  If you have a question, there's a very high probability that you will find an answer here.<br />but...<br />buy the paperback edition.  This doesn't translate to kindles very well.  Tables are wonky.
B000FC1AGG|5.0|I love Sophie Kinsella, her heroines are bright, smart, funny and a tad insecure. You feel like you know them, it coils be one of your own friends. I have read this book multiple times and each time I love it more.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|When you update an app you expect it to be a better version not a half the page commercial and<br />more confusing layouts!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|I love the graphics.  I was very impressed that it actually has a storyline, especially a good storyline. Definitely recommend for anyone looking for something more substantial than hack and slash.

B005LAII80|4.0|Full disclosure: I came at this film as a die-hard fan of the Stallone vehicle. Maligned as it is, it offered a very faithful interpretation of the Judge Dredd universe, megacities, cursed earth, and all. In fact it is my belief that Stallone's Judge Dredd would be remembered fondly to this day had it not totally screwed up Judge Dredd himself. Stallone's Dredd kisses girls, takes off his hat, and generally behaves nothing like his comic book namesake.<br /><br />So for many fans, the tension for Dredd was the same. Will Judge Dredd be right? I'm happy to report that yes, Dredd is spot on. Carl Urban scowls, grimaces, does absolutely nothing to be appealing, and doesn't even take off his face-obstructing helmet when he's been shot through with armor-piercing ammunition. In fact the only field judge in the film who DOES show her face is Judge Anderson because hey, it would be a crime to cover up Olivia Thirlby. Speaking of which, good news there! Thirlby's Anderson brings the beloved supporting character (and sometimes miniseries star) to life with spunk and verve, and is a more than competent foil to both Dredd and the lowlifes they must battle.<br /><br />As much as this film improves on its predecessor's depiction of Dredd, however, its depiction of Megacity 1 veers far further off. This megacity is a much more believable place, an endless smoggy sea of skyscrapers and gridlock that stretches on forever, studded by Megablocks; enormous arcologies packed with far more people than they should hold. It's a minimalist, realistic place that suggests Gotham City or Equilibrium, and frankly I didn't care for it at first blush. But it grew on me; this film had neither the money for a more fanciful Megacity 1, nor the inclination. This is a SERIOUS Dredd film, ripped more from the pages of the later comics than from the camp 70s material that spawned the Stallone picture.<br /><br />The grit carries over into all respects of the property. Dredd's armor and motorcycle are toned down and believably futuristic; the technology of the world is less \\"world of tomorrow\\" and more \\"next decade,\\" and the Peach Trees megablock in which the film takes place is no futuristic spire or industrial nightmare, but a bunkeresque mashup of prison and council-housing. The use of colors and lighting both inside and out to induce loneliness and claustrophobia is more than a little reminiscent of the unlicensed 2000 AD film Hardware, which will please most fans of 2000 AD or British sci fi in general. All of this urban wasteland is underscored by a throbbing, buzzing electronic soundtrack that pitches and falls as the film moves along, but never quite disappears.<br /><br />The plot is paper thin but totally workable. Dredd and Anderson learn of a drug operation stemming from a particularly lawless megablock and move in to establish law and order. They soon find themselves trapped with the building's blast doors on one side and the cutthroat Ma Ma clan on the other. The gang's eponymous crime lord is played by Lena Headey, who is more or less channeling Cersei Lannister on a lazy weekend for the role, with good success. What ensues is a solid movie's worth of crazy gun battles with horribly graphic results. In its violence this movie closes in more on its source material, capturing the crazy kind of world Dredd inhabits- life is cheap, death only closes a mall for a half hour, and the police are equally likely to ticket you, imprison you for life, or shoot you in the face.<br /><br />The bottom line is that while this film does not capture the Dredd universe as vividly as the Stallone movie, it still gets the gist and it makes far better use of the characters. Here we finally have Dredd as the force of nature he is meant to be- neither good nor evil, a faceless avatar of his world's authoritarian law, destroying all those who break it purely on principle. We empathize with Dredd and Anderson, not because they are virtuous, but because the enemies they slayin such huge numbers are so much WORSE. Acting as a prequel of sorts to the books, and working with very little money, this movie still succeeds and would be a great basis for sequels. However this is probably not to be as it frankly lost money hand over fist. This is a crying shame as it is a stark, surprising sci-fi action yarn that will at least intrigue any fans of the comic or genre.<br /><br />The picture on blu ray is quite good, and the audio is deep and clear as a mountain stream. Points are docked for the opening trailers, which must be skipped manually (thanks, Lions' Gate) but there are a wealth of good extras including a pretty solid interview with many of the artists and writers to work on Dredd over the decades.

B00AZMFO6I|3.0|Maggie's performance is great but less stellar than my aunt Violet's but this movie is definitely worth watching.  Having been to more than one retirement home I can say it is certainly realistic.
B00AB7HESI|5.0|this is my favorite game in the world i really think that you should get this amazing game. its the best of the best!
1616550414|5.0|This book covers all current Zelda games, giving you the timeline for each game currently out. Also, the collection of artwork in here is so great. I love this guy and leave it out for all to share.
B004RJMUJO|2.0|i like this game a little its fun at first but then you just play it over and over again. so i would get the free version
B007TKT2SK|5.0|pretty dang cool, not going to complain.  Did the job just as it says.<br />Nothing less.  But the best part... NOTHING MORE.  Like adds..<br />thanks guys :)
B00992CF6W|3.0|well the first thing i thought about this game was what the heck! thats $6.99 for one single game. I could get seven games for $7.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Good story but sad.  The author did a good job switching from 1 character to the other.  Very slow start though. It got more and more interesting towards the end and you can not tell what was going to happen at the end so be prepared to stay awake and reading all night to know the end.
B0064MGU98|5.0|Awesome<br />I'm catch myself holding my breath and then can't wait for the next episode<br />If you haven't watched this show you really need to
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Because of all the great reviews, I was really excited to play this game. After downloading, installing, uninstalling, deleting 5 times...etc. It will not work! It just keeps saying &quot;force close&quot;. Very frustrating &amp; disappointing.
0316743003|5.0|Awesome book I couldnt put it down. Reccomend to any aviation fan and sledhead fanatic. I learned alot about the nistory of stealth planes and Lockheed and most importantly the people involved in such perfection
B0090SI582|5.0|To begin, this was a great superhero movie in general, and it was one of my favorite movies in the X-Men series. The visual effects were great, and of course, so was the acting. Hugh Jackman looks as ripped as ever and he really brings the character of Wolverine to life! Watch it in theaters then buy it on bluray!
B008YKGQR4|1.0|Works good on home page but not on myown page or anyone else's.<br />It was free but I cant really say I like it on my kindle. I usually go get the lap top to check facebook.
B00DM12ANO|5.0|Nice film, the visuals were fantastic , very interesting story-line, it had just the right amount of action and romance.<br />Ther characters were realistic and likable.  This was not just anouther sci fi same old stuff. I'd recomend it as a nice relaxing get a way flick.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Very awesome little device, and it has a ton of potential.  Would love to see some Prime casting in the future. :)
B00DU73T08|2.0|Starts out good but half way threw get long and dragged out, I didnt finish it because i lost interest.
B00CZAYNOC|3.0|There have been a lot of bands lately that have stuck with their same tried and true formula (namely SEVENDUST, ALL THAT REMAINS, and SKILLET). FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH is yet another one of those examples. And it's even more disappointing considering this is the first part of a double album. Especially in recent months when we've had solid attempts at double albums such as with STONE SOUR and COHEED AND CAMBRIA, usually that means that a band is trying to go out of the box and show us that they can do more than what they know. That is severely not the case with FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH's latest outing THE WRONG SIDE OF HEAVEN AND THE RIGHTEOUS SIDE OF HELL PART 1. I will give this album a load of credit. The band still knows how to make a techincally satisfying guitar riff/solo, and the special guests are a huge treat (well, excluding the cover with TECH N9NE). However, that doesn't stop this album from being a lyrical mess. I mean, how can you title a song BURN MF and expect us not to realize that the song is going to have a ton of emotionless F-bombs, as well as be a pointless hate rant against society? Why does the song I.M.SIN start off with using the word \\"poser\\"? I know that AMERICAN CAPITALIST shared some of the same problems that this album did, but AMERICAN CAPITALIST simply did that much better and is overall a fun and catchy rock n roll album. This tries to be the same, but falls flat, and overall just ends up sounding the exact same as that album. Even the ballads tread familiar territory, even though the title track is well written. I like this album, even if it is a disappointment, but FIVE FINGER DEATH PUNCH really need to watch their step and try to make an album that sounds much different from this, or else they'll end up as just another radio-rock band.<br /><br />Rating: 3 stars/5 stars
B00992CF6W|5.0|Blew me away. Perfect for kids and adults all ages with large imaginations. If you have xbox or pc edition this is great for on the go. I can't wait until realms, the online pocket edition server, is completed.
B008Y76VW2|1.0|This movie is just a meaningless series of events. Not a comedy at all. We held out until the end and it wasn't worth it.
B008MEM24S|5.0|This is a fun little time waster featuring our favorite special agent. The game is easy to learn and challenging to master, so it makes replays fun.

B004EBT5CU|5.0|She has a great voice and style.  Wonderful arrangements.  Almost every song is wonderful to listen to time and again.  One of my favorites.
B00AHDXTIK|4.0|Great cable and great quality. It feels good being able to roll around in my bed while my phone is charging instead of being confined to sticking my arm out the whole time to prevent the cord from yanking out of the wall (as with the Apple Lightening cable).<br /><br />Would have gave 5 stars but the cord is thick and doesn't really bend and twist easily (in a good way) as the original Apple cord is.<br />Other than that the length is perfect and was a great purchase.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Great movie. Would see it again. Quentin Tarantino at his finest! It was more than I expected.  Great storyline. Samuel L Jackson's character was one that you loved to hate.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This is the best game EVER! I LOVE all the levels they are SO MUCH FUN! EVERYONE should play this game! GET IT NOW. :-)
1781162646|5.0|I have not read many Stephen King books.  I found this book very enjoyable. Was an easy read. I would recommend to anyone. I will be reading more of Kings books!
0743487583|5.0|I ordered this book for my daughter to read for her PreAP class. The book was delivered very quickly and exactly what She needed.
B00CWVM1AC|3.0|After seeing \\"Yossi & Jagger\\"(which was great), I assumed that the \\"Yossi\\" movie that followed would be just as good if not better especially since it has an average 4 star rating. But I was quite disappointed. The acting was good but but the movie suffered from one major flaw - it was really slow with hardly any twists and turns. Therefore I would rate it as 3 stars....at best
B00CEZJT2E|4.0|This thing is great. It is roughly the same size as my Nexus 4 but has almost triple the battery capacity!<br /><br />The design of it is well thought out. For Android devices or anything that takes Micro USB, you don't even need to remember cables. All you need is this battery since it is built in. And with a 6000 mAh battery, you know it will be able to charge anything you can throw at it.<br /><br />And the great thing about the battery capacity in this is that it can charge just about any smartphone at least twice. An iPhone has ~1500 mAh battery, meaning this can charge it around 4 times from 0 to 100%. With a GS4 at 2600 mAh, it can charge it from 0 to 100 more than 2 times. And if you only charge your phone at night, this is a perfect thing to bring with you on weekend vacations.<br /><br />The only major drawback is that the connector to charge a device is too big to work when you have a case on your phone. At least for same cases. It is too large to work with my Nexus 4 if the bumper is on.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this to anyone.
B00CP2Z5TC|3.0|While there songs may be catchy and upbeat, the formula really sounds similar to previous albums. And if that's what you enjoy, this is a wonderful thing. If you are one of those music lovers who enjoys artists who evolve with their new art...not so wonderful.
B0095VPAVE|4.0|For the price, AMD produces some great products. They aren't always the most powerful or the most energy efficient. But for certain uses, their products make the most sense.<br /><br />In terms of this CPU, it was a perfect choice for a small HTPC. Video streaming through Plex works great and overall Windows 7 feels fluid with just 4GB RAM. Although outside of Plex and streaming, I don't do much on it.<br /><br />But if you are looking to build a good computer for basic operation, I have no trouble recommending this.
B0090SI582|4.0|\\"The Wolverine\\" is almost as far from \\"X-Men Origins: Wolverine\\" as it could get considering that it involves Marvel's iconic and not-so-merry mutant with the beyond impressive healing factor and Adamantium-laced skeleton.  While the first movie did a great job with some elements (the opening/ title sequence giving you a snapshot history of Wolvie for instance) it did try to cram a lot into its origin story while still fitting into the Marvel cinematic universe and providing a lot of fan service (his duel with Deadpool? overkill).  By contrast \\"The Wolverine\\" feels almost unnaturally grounded; it's a drama with a specifically Japanese ethos that flits some brief action sequences in and out of it until the last 15 or so minutes of the movie when it feels like an actual comic book/ superhero movie.  And it aint half bad, bub.<br /><br />Directed by James Mangold (\\"Walk the Line\\"; \\"Knight and Day\\"; \\"3:10 To Yuma\\"), who has worked with the Wolverine himself previously in an off-kilter and pleasing romantic comedy (\\"Kate & Leopold\\", pretty good, you should check it out), \\"The Wolverine\\" doesn't bother to try to follow right after the \\"Origins\\" movie.  Instead this movie takes up a little while after the events of \\"X-Men 3: The Last Stand\\" with Logan (Wolverine for those who don't know) living up in the northern wilderness suffering nightmares/ waking visions of Jean Grey.  He's checked out of the superhero and X-Men business and has taken a vow essentially not to kill.  But his less-than-idyllic living is interrupted by a young small Japanese woman who is handy with a sword (comic fans may notice that what they have done with this character is make her similar, in ways, to a certain Jubilation Lee...).  She draws him to Japan to say goodbye to a former Japanese soldier that he had saved in WWII.  From here Logan is drawn into the lives of Yukio (the sword girl) and Mariko (the granddaughter of the soldier whom he had saved previously).  Logan falls in love (I'm not telling you with whom...but could it be both?) and through this lapse into love and his following actions to save her/ them from the family's internal politics regains his desire to live, and to fight again.  All of this occurs in Japan and the Japanese setting and actors provide a genuine feel for their culture and, while the film doesn't try to get deep into it, allows their culture's historical ideal of death before dishonor to be held up within several of the characters meaning that this is frequently their main motivations to take action.  This lends the film an almost mysterious feel.  It isn't a film that will make you leave the theater pumping your fist and yelling \\"YEAH!\\" nor is it a film that will make you shrug your shoulders and ask \\"is that it?\\"  It is a film that will linger, quietly and a bit unexpectedly, with you so that you don't mind returning to it some time in the near future.<br /><br />The action sequences aren't overpowering.  This is bound to disappoint some fans; the tradeoff was that Mangold created a more emotionally compelling Wolverine.  Also, effort was made to provide a storyline in which Wolverine is stripped of his healing factor and thus made physically vulnerable (we know he's emotionally vulnerable as he's oft portrayed as emotionally damaged goods) in a non-sensational manner that actually makes some sense.  By doing this Mangold and the writers were able to raise the emotional stakes for this unbeatable character.  And, I must say, there were three genuinely surprising moments in this film for me where I could hardly believe what they did; completely unexpected.  My main qualms were how they ended the film; Wolverine should have said more to his love.  I also wish that they would have had Wolverine study the Samurai's way (as he did in the comics that they based this storyline off of) and played up the Ronin (leaderless Samurai) angle more.  They played around these edges but never went into this particular box.<br /><br />Be sure to watch for the teaser during the closing credits.<br /><br />My closing thoughts are that this is a good movie, enjoyable and with some emotional weight, one that won't overwhelm the viewer by any stretch of the imagination but that will likely linger quietly with the (adult) viewer awhile afterward.

1596177373|2.0|Now i thought i would fall in love with these cards.For the design that was used for them was beautiful,and the reviews looked great as well as the price.So i gave in.Until i opened them and felt them.That's were i knew i wasn't going to use them for the would be ripped and bent so easily in a actual game.It seems to me that the inventors didn't focus on the quality.ONLY DESIGN...Which isn't good when they are call and made for playing cards.These cards feel terribly they are very paper like then normal playing cards.So i beg of you to DON'T PURCHASE.Unless you want it for design.Then i give them a A- For not every cards design is unique.

B002AWX6UM|5.0|I had to read this book for school, and as always I despise reading, but when I started to read it it got more and more interesting as it went on. I like how it was all based on true events and the vivid details where awesome. This was the first war book that actually are me tear up. It is a heart racing book that is hard to put down! So I I give it a 5 star rating because simply it earned it, it isn't a bull**** story from someone who thinks they know what happened and what the soldiers went through because Ishmael Beah really went through it all. I will recommend this book to anyone who wants a interesting and emotional war book. Ishmael Beah this was a fabulous book!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000FC10QG|5.0|A fast pace read confirming that real life events are even more amazing than fiction. Great in detail, funny, scary and educational. All wrapped into a book which I found to be a great read.

B005OT2YVA|5.0|If you liked the first Transformers movies then I feel you will enjoy Dark Of The Moon. They continue to fallow the story lines from the other movies. But, you see I like this type of movie, others may not. But this movie has it all for a guy. Pretty girls, fast cars & some slow one's too, big steel auto bots who like to tear up things and then blow up what ever they want wow, great stuff thank-U
B0064NTZQ2|5.0|I loved this movie, the music, action scenes, and the whole story line was pretty good to watch.  A lot of people are to impatient to really understand the whole story line and appreciate it.
B00DV2D0JC|5.0|Well worth it and more.  Very lengthy (a definite plus),  beautiful graphics,  smooth gameplay,  intriguing story line,  great HO scenes,  and definitely one of G5's greatest.  It was so addictive that I spent hours at a time playing. No issues or glitches what-so-ever.  Anyone,  even non HOG gamers can easily fall in love with this game.  5 stars doesn't do this dev justice bcuz they rightfully deserve 10 stars!
B005FITIK0|5.0|This movie gets 5 stars from me because Charlize is funny and never dull in this movie.  She is a really great actress and this movie really shows her talent.

B00BGICG5W|3.0|The movie starts with hilarity, then stumbles through a rather slow and somewhat depressing middle, before regaining some good energy and humor in the end. During the middle, I started despising the Paul Rudd character for his self pity and general stupidity. Leslie Mann puts on a quality performance in this movie as the mother, and the two actors playing the kids are brilliant.  In many ways, for someone in their early 40s, this movie hits home.

B001XUPF2O|4.0|An excellent sequel to the refreshing reboot Batman rises. This will be a classic soon and the swan song movie for Heath Leger. The superb portrayal of The Joker By Leger will leave you wondering, what could have been.
B00004RJ71|5.0|I saw American Me one late weekend night and thought it was a good raw depiction of the Mexican gang life then looked up other movies like it. For months I wanted to see blood in blood out and went to countless video stores to get it until I decided to just buy it. The movie was awesome! The plot was super interesting! My bf and I didn't even wanna pause for bathroom breaks lol. This is a must see! Now whenever we relate to Mexican crime drama or recommend a crime related movie we refer to blood in blood out.
B0031Y4ALC|5.0|Granted this is a reissue, but the quality of audio is second to none. the packaging that amazon ships it in was so secure and sturdy. This album takes me back. I LOVE IT.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game just because of the goals you have to do. I'm not like a horse lover or anything, but I still like this game. I also really like it because kids love to play on it too so it's great for babysitting.

B000SEGTI0|5.0|I haven't seen Blade Runner, but &#34;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep&#34; is the book on which the movie is based. The protagonist's job is to hunt androids that seem very much like humans.<br /><br />The book is thought provoking right off the bat. At the start, I actually thought that the protagonist was an android himself because he was using a machine to manipulate his emotions. At the very least, the book raises the question of human exceptionalism: if androids are considered different from humans because their emotions are a little different from ours, but human emotions are themselves manipulable by machine, then it seems unjust to treat androids as second class citizens.<br /><br />The book brings up some issues of life in a dying world (eg, the main world religion in the book is vegetarian because of a karma-like experience of all beings being connected). However, I find &#34;The Road&#34; to be a more compelling exploration of that question.<br /><br />Like many of Philip K. Dick's novels, there is also a lot in the book that seems like it might be meaningful but that I can't quite figure out.

B00003JRCQ|5.0|Jane Austen's shortest novel is perhaps the most easily adapted to feature film length -- the others do better as serializations -- and this version is superb. Amanda Root as Anne Elliott starts as a sad and slightly depressed young woman who nevertheless always treats everybody well -- better than some deserve, in fact -- but who, when she gets a chance at happiness (after Louisa Musgrove falls in love with Captain Benwick) becomes positive and quietly active in her efforts to recapture the affections of her old love, Captain Wentworth. Ciaran Hinds is an ideal Wentworth, a naval man whose years at sea have rubbed some social polish from him but whose basically attractive directness and good-heartedness have survived. Corin Redgrave is the narcissistic Sir Walter, Anne's snobbish and fiscally irresponsible father, Sophie Thompson is perfect as Anne's limp sister Mary (who has married Charles Musgrove [Simon Russell Beale], who once courted Anne), and Susan Fleetwood (Lady Russell), Fiona Shaw and John Woodvine (as the Crofts, Sir Walter's tenants and Wentworth's sister and brother-in-law) are English theater stalwarts in relatively minor roles, though important to the plot. Sam West is the handsome but manipulative heir to the Elliott estate whom Wentworth thinks of, mistakenly, as a temptation for Anne.  The attention to the interiors (that mark social and economic standing) and costume is exemplary, and remarkably little that is important to the book is changed -- one might complain that Anne's elder sister, Elizabeth, a great beauty in the book, is not pretty enough here, and Mrs Clay, who is angling after the widowed Sir Walter, is also insufficiently attractive, when one remembers that good looks matter to Sir Walter almost more than anything.  And Anne's friend Mrs Smith comes across as more of an airhead than the chastened invalid of the novel.  Anne's final appearance on the deck of Wentworth's ship is maybe a step too far, and their very public kiss at Bath would not have happened as it did in 1814. But these minor quibbles don't diminish the achievement here -- the level of acting is very high and the film's handling of the romantic resolution is satisfying in the way the book's is.h would not have happened as it did in 1814.

0553328255|5.0|We got these books after watching the pbs series, and we are not disappointed. why did I wait so long to read these?!!
B000004166|5.0|The playing on these two discs is simply superb, but it is recorded very \\"close up\\" (though with good balance between orchestra and soloist).  With my Bose setup, I had to cut the volume down ten notches below my usual listening level to get a nice natural sound (from 59 to 49, for my headphones).  Some listeners might feel that the orchestral image is still too \\"rich,\\" and it's true that this isn't \\"original instrument\\" scale -- but Davis's tempos are so apt, and his attention to details of dynamics and texture are so evident, that I wasn't bothered by that.  Davis was doing some superb work in the 1960's and 1970's in the opera house and with soloists like Grumiaux and Kovacevich, and this recording is evidence of it.  The five violin concertos, all written before Mozart was 20, are lovely and graceful works, with a vein of expressiveness in Nos. 3 and 4 that prefigures the great piano concertos and symphonies to come.  Grumiaux and Davis play them perfectly, in my judgment: they are not over-romanticized in phrasing for all the relatively big orchestral scale, and Grumiaux's tone is lovely but never cloying, and he plays with great rhythmic judgment throughout.  Some of the cadenzas are his own; others are by Ysaye and Joachim -- all are apt.  The greatest piece here is the longer and more ambitious Sinfonia Concertante for violin and viola (K.364), with the violist Arrigo Pelliccia.  Mozart composed it about four years after the concertos, and it has a depth of expression beyond the violin works and more substantive development of the thematic material in the first two movements.  It is hauntingly performed here.<br /><br />The only concerto recordings that are as fine (or maybe better) than these are Francescatti's accounts of Nos. 3 and 4 with Bruno Walter -- one of the truly great Mozart recordings.  One might quibble and call them too \\"romantic\\" but I wouldn't.  Grumiaux is in that league.

B005LAII80|5.0|'In a world gone mad ...' ok, no voiceover man impersonation needed. Just wanted to say as someone who read 2000AD in the 70s and 80s and always preferred it to the dc and marvel material, it's sad that lots of bland CGI-fest superhero movies get tons of cash thrown at them and 1000s of theatres to display them, yet a ballsy film like this done on a relatively limited budget and woefully limited distribution has to struggle for a sequel. This is the real deal from writers who knew what they were doing. Think of its 2000AD stablemates such as Slaine, ABC Warriors, Rogue Trooper etc that would also make great movie franchises. You don't have to make a one-size-fits-all pg13-neutered mess of a flick to make money, movies aimed squarely at grownups can and should too. Here's a good example, imagine how much better yet if the investment was there. You just have to have the guts to back real creativity and commitment to getting it seen. I sincerely hope the DVD sales are epic so we get the bigger-budget sequel the fans deserve. The best 'superhero/antihero' of the lot. Long live Dredd.

B001GJ9GG8|2.0|This should have been great, given the actors, but the movie's pacing just plodded. Not even half the movie of The Thomas Crowne Affair with Pierce Brosnan. TTCA also had more wit, especially the climax in the museum.
B00D6QU6RW|5.0|Absolutely love this album.  While the songs are not what some may expect from BSB songs, it is still an amazing album.  The Boys have changed their sound and allowed it to grow along with themselves and their fans.  I especially love the fact that all of the Boys' voices are showcased in this CD.  Can't wait to see the concert on August 18!!!!

B00CFA227C|2.0|Maybe great for preteens.  But for adults this is just plain not good.  I was disappointed by the effects, the characters and the action.  So...pretty much everything.<br /><br />Director Bryan Singer, the man behind X-Men and X2 (the \\"good\\" movies of the franchise), truly disappointed me with his spin on Jack and the Beanstalk.  Other than a few somewhat funny moments, this movie was simply moderately entertaining and largely a letdown.  This is just my opinion though.  So if you want to cut the criticism short and hear a review from someone who had a more positive experience with this movie, then please read the top rated reviews on Amazon.<br /><br />This classic tale follows the classic plot points.  Jack trades something for some \\"magic beans,\\" he's scolded for being stupid by his uncle, the seeds get wet and a bean stalk on steroids lifts his house to the land of giants up in the clouds, and then he faces off against giants.<br /><br />As Jack, Nicholas Hoult brings a strong sense of purity and goodness as if it came naturally to him.  Despite that, I wasn't otherwise impressed by his performance at all, which is unusual.  I typically very much enjoy his acting.  We quickly meet his love interest, future queen Isabelle (Eleanor Tomlinson), who also fails to impress me and is accidently carried to the land of giants with Jack's house.<br /><br />A smooth, well-spoken and stylishly haired knight named Elmont (Ewan McGregor) leads a band to rescue Isabelle from the land of giants.  He goes with a company of knights, Jack and Isabelle's extremely unsavory intended husband Roderick (Stanley Tucci).  Roderick slithers his way through the story and manages to do something despicable every step of the way.  He backstabs everybody and sides with the giants to seize King Brahmwell's (Ian McShane) kingdom below for himself.  I was unimpressed with all of these characters.  ALL OF THEM!!!  Sorry.  I call it like I see it.<br /><br />The giants are led by General Fallon (Bill Nighy).  Bill Nighy normally does great playing evil bad guys (e.g., Underworld, the Pirates franchise).  However, I felt he really missed his regular benchmark here.  Nothing about his character struck me as inhuman except for the CGI that illustrated him on screen.  Speaking of which, the CGI is just \\"okay.\\"  I've seen MUCH better.  I guess it does its job but shows far too strong of a contrast with the non-computer-generated actors and backgrounds.  This goes not only for the giants, but for the fantasy-scapes as well.  Much as General Fallon, the other giants fail to feel like monsters outside of eating humans and their deliberate appearance.  They're simply mean \\"giant\\" humans and, as a result, were uninteresting.<br /><br />Sadly, while provoking a few giggles, I didn't care for the action either.  And the ending was just awful.  I can comfortably say that there were only three things that I really liked about this movie.<br /><br />1)  There's  a knight with a monocle.  That's as random as the Monopoly guy fighting in the UFC.<br />2)  General Fallon's second head.  It's a brain-damaged, malformed little mongoloid that growls, cackles and mumbles incoherently with a stupid, googly-eyed look on its face at all times.  It reminded me of Gollum.<br />3)  Ewan McGregor's hair.  I had no idea that fantasy knights had access to decent hair products.ill Nighy).

030758836X|4.0|The characters were interesting at first, but they became more unlikeable and self-absorbed as the novel proceeded.<br />The ending was expected and yet, disappointing.
B00C2IN7CG|5.0|This is probably my favorite sequel. This and The Dark Knight are like the two best sequels ever in my opinion. Michael Keaton is awesome as Batman just as he was in the previous film, Danny DeVito, perfect choice for the Penguin, Michelle Pfeiffer, sexy and seductive, just perfect as Catwoman and I also like Christopher Walken's performance. True, it's very dark in its themes and tones, but it's a great kind of psychological thriller exploring the psyches of the three principal characters and their outlook on the world and how they enforce that outlook, Batman trying to bring justice with his traumatized past, Catwoman's anger and frustration over her pitiful life, and Penguin's hatred for being shunned by his high class family. Tim Burton really knows how to explore the genesis of an imaginative mind so to make this movie a real dark thriller, he combines a lot of techniques that he knows would make Batman a dark movie with the imagery and settings and mood and of course using Danny Elfman's musical score. It's still Batman, but it's definitely edgy thanks to Burton and of course all these great actors who contributed their talent to making these characters as innovative as the film.

0374533555|5.0|If you have read my other reviews you will know I have read 100's of self help books over the years. I am a business consultant, peak performance expert, entrepreneur and University lecturer amongst other things. As such I read books in order to improve my knowledge and the advice I can give others. I ordered this book via the Vine programme in the hope I may end up learning something new about how the mind can create happiness without all the positive thinking garbage that some book push.<br /><br />The basic premise of the book is that human beings are not as rational as they think they are and that their mind is not as reliable as they think it is. The polemic put forward by the author is very interesting. In essence what it is saying is that human beings have only so much energy they can expend on thinking, therefore we prioritise where we use our brain power and once that energy is running low we then make assumptions about things and these assumptions may not be as reliable as we think they are.<br /><br />The book itself could be split into two halves, the first is great and allows the reader to use \\"experiments\\" to test how their brain works and the traps it falls into to in the way it thinks and so illustrates the authors thesis very well. The second half of the book is not as good as he expands the \\"irrational thinking\\" thesis much further, whilst using less and less examples. I must say in comparison to the first half of the book, the second half ideas are less credible that those put forward in the first half and some are not believable at all.<br /><br />Overall, this is a book of two halves. The first is brilliant, inspired, focused and eye opening, it uses brain experiments to illustrate the points and which do seem to prove the thesis. The second half is not as good and I feel the author tries to over-expand his ideas to pad the book out, without using experiments to prove his point.<br /><br />The basic theory appears to be reliable but after page 210 the ideas put forward seem to be less reliable. Recommended.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This is a great follow up to the first IPMann. Nice view of Chinese culture and city life . One and two are by far two of the best martial arts I have seen. Donnie Yen plays it wonderfully in under stated wisdom and action. Best close up action ever!
B005K0HDGE|3.0|A good yarn and clever conceit by King but it's muddled up by excessive length and an overly nostalgic view of the time period. There has been a trend lately with gifted authors overrunning their editors and padding good stories with unnecessary filler that drags the plot. This work by King fell victim to that. This book could have easily been 300 pages shorter and been a tighter tale.<br /><br />As usual, King has populated the book with interesting, believable characters and done true yeoman's work researching the late 1950's and early 60's. The period comes to life in vivid detail. I found the main character a rather dense, vapid fellow however. Presumably well read and educated, Jake is oddly oblivious to the pretty obvious cataclysmic potential of time travel. Even early demonstrations of this through his and Al's early trips through the portal don't seem to register. Jake's endless fascination and fetishism of the time period grows tedious after a while as well. Especially given that he's constantly confronted with reasons why he doesn't belong there. Evidently everyone in the reading audience and the book itself can see there's no way Jake's mission to re-write history is going to end well.<br /><br />Having laid out all this criticism, any book by Stephen King is better than 90% of anything else out there. If you want to read a recent King book I thought was great, try The Wind Through the Keyhole. That was fantastic.
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|So glad they have finally released the first in the series. Now if they would just get the next couple released I can finish the series. Although I hope Jo Nesbo keeps writing more about Detective Harry Hole. I really enjoy these.
0140143505|5.0|A short book containing the letters between an American writer, Helene Hanff, and a British bookseller, Frank Doel (FPD). A wonderful friendship forms for 20 years through the pursuit of used books in 'clean copies' and the exchange of small bits of personal information revealing their lives, such as, the rationing in Britain during the late 1940's and the frugal lifestyle of an American writer with a love of old books. Warms the heart and makes me long for a comfortable relationship with a small cozy bookstore and its staff that I could walk into and have people know me by name
0812982622|2.0|I really wanted to like this book. It sounded so great, but just wasn't. The author sometimes lingers on one thing for way to long, then abruptly jumps ahead. How long, days? week? Sometimes it is not clear at all. I finally got the hang of the writing style and was somewhat invested in the character when an entirely new part of the book started. I know they were related, but it was just so jarring and a bit confusing. There was some insight into North Korea, but the style of writing turned me off. I did not feel like I was there or get drawn into the story because it was so jumpy. I had friend that simply gave up reading less than halfway in since she simply did not like it.
B004S7TVYC|5.0|I'm excited to read this series..plus I need fourteen words to express my excitement!  woohoo! I need five more words this is a stupid requirement!
B004RKXHZY|5.0|I love Anna and the French Kiss, but I may have liked this even better. If not for the other things I had to do, I probably would have read this in one sitting.
B00CL151G4|5.0|...stunning show...therefore the FIVE stars...writing...cast (adore Jonny Lee Miller as Sherlock and his relationship with \\"Watson\\")..plots..food for the brain, IMO...whimsical with substance...same great grouping as \\"Person of Interest\\"...was so looking forward to BUYING this...but NO BLU-RAY; NO SALE!...what century are these mfgs living in? (rhetorical/did it to me with A&E's \\"Longmire,\\" too)...this has replay value to me...but not without BD discs...*sigh*...anyone who doesn't care?  buy the standard...absolutely worth the watch...
B00338QENI|5.0|I am an admitted science geek and I work in clinical research so this was right up my alley, but it was also so well written. The author does an amazing job of explaining her subject in a way that anyone can understand and weaving the story of HELA cells and the Lacks family together made a compelling read. I wanted everyone around me to read this too so that we could discuss it. It was so thought provoking on matters of race, technology, privacy, and both personal and intellectual rights.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Entertaining and addicting. Great actors with a great story line. Cant wait to watch season 2 and 3. Love it
B00CKJ2KK2|4.0|It good but There's a this stupid Extra Data u Have to Download Before u can play that Takes 500 something Mb I would make it 5 if it didn't need it
B00CATSONE|4.0|this was a great book about Tesla.  It was wonderful to get a glimpse inside his mind and see what drives him
B008Y1RTUG|5.0|Even though everybody says that The Evil Queen in this movie steals the show , It is really Kristen Stewart and Chris Hemsworth who are really Bella and Thor ,They are the best because they are enjoyably complex and you really feel for them . The Evil Queen is underdeveloped and is a very standard character and should have been played by Angelina Jolie . Overall Snow White and The Huntsman is the best Snow White adaptation i have seen because of mostly its action and acting .
B00CWY76CC|3.0|level 9 always acted up on me an kept freezing the game. it was fun at first then it started hugging out
B009SCRERI|5.0|I bought this for my 4 yr old granddaughter to watch on her Kindle while traveling. She was mesmerized!  I lost count of how many times she watched it during our road trip. Nearly every time she comes to our home with her Kindle she plays this movie. She just never gets tired of it.  Best video I've ever purchased for her.  Can't go wrong with this one, especially for a little girl.

B0001I561E|3.0|The Cave of Wonders is scary! Okay, I am just stating that right now! I was frightened of the lava scene, the idea of going inside a talking cave that could kill someone is freaky! UggggggggggH! What kind of Disney film would allow something as scary as that to exist? That, along with the cave-in scene was why I was too scared of it as a kid! I thought it was the scariest Disney movie I had ever seen! This might seem weird since my favorite Disney film \\"The Great Mouse Detective\\" had a few scary shots, but they didn't make me shudder like this CREEPY TALKING MONSTER CAVE DID! YAAAAAAAAAH!<br /><br />But I will admit, I have outgrown my fear of the Cave of Wonders, although the idea of going INSIDE that thing still creeps me out. I have been able to see the good inside this film, though it's still not one of my favorites, just reduced to the \\"okay\\" category. I mean, the Genie is a great comic relief, as well as Abu and the Magic Carpet who reminds me of the enchanted objects in \\"Beauty and the Beast.\\" Jafar is a pretty cool villain, and Iago is pretty funny too.\\"Friend Like Me\\" is very entertaining, and \\"A Whole New World\\"is very enchanting. I think it seems similar to \\"The Little Mermaid\\" except for a male as the protagonist this time.<br /><br />I guess I can watch this film a little better now that I'm not scared of it anymore. Honestly, I never HATED this film, I was just too scared of it, and I did like that TV series adaptation. But my frightening past with this film holds me back from loving it. The longer I had to put up with the Cave of Wonders, the quicker I just wanted to run away!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|What a mess! The Weather Channel app is horrible.<br /><br />Why did the geeks at Weather Channel makes. It too complicated for the older generation?
B008YWY0HK|3.0|It's not that this movie is bad, I just find it too questionable. What exactly was Pixar trying to get across in this film? The characters say something about changing their fates, but no one knows what their fate will be. We can only change our fates when we know them, or at least sometime we can. The accents...don't exactly help. And the story is just a little dissapointing. I was hoping this would be a \\"Mulan\\" kind of story where Merida goes into a war, or she could go on a quest, but instead we get...turning her mother into a bear. Yeah, bears are not exactly that interesting, and they let Pixar throw away a great opportunity for a film set in medieval Scotland. Also, the villain is yet another ferocious animal, with no actual evil plot. Yeah, villains who are downplayed like this just don't fascinate me very well. I mean there are some good things about this film, particularly the triplet brothers. They may not speak, but their comical actions speak loud enough. Also, I guess it is rare to see a strained relationship with a mother. It's usually the father whom the main characters argue with. Was this movie meant to teach a lesson to mothers and daughters? Eh, possibly. Merida's design is not that beautiful and I feel as though she's the black sheep of the Disney Princesses. SHe just doesn't do anything that remarkable. I am DREADING a bunch of complaints from my sister when she figures THAT out. I'd say the only time I felt annoyed at this film was when it won the Academy Award for Best ANimated Film instead of \\"Wreck-It Ralph\\" which I thought told a better story and should have been a Pixar film. I guess this film is okay for what is is, but I would still like to see something a little stronger.
B001FB55I0|4.0|GREAT MOVIE AND SHIPPING AND HANDLING...GREAT TIMING...ONLY ONE PROBLEM...WHEN I GOT THE BLU RAY BRAND NEW...THE DIGITAL COPY CODE WAS EXPIRED...WAS NOT TOLD OF THIS WHEN I ORDERED...BUT OTHER THAN THAT VERY SATISIFIED!!!
B00A83075M|4.0|At first, I wasn't so sure what to think of this film. I thought Pixar, Dreamworks, or even Blue SKy Studios should have made this film. But that does not mean it was bad. No, it was better than I expected it. At first I thought it was going to be a journey movie where Ralph would meet and be accompanied by Vanellope Von Schweetz along the way. But actually...no. It turned out to be a story I hadn't seen before. Ralph helping Vanellope in a her crisis. Helping her dream come true while having to deal with the evil King Candy. ANd speaking of which, I found King Candy a very well developed villain. When I thought this was a journey movie, I wondered how King Candy would be the main villain? Would he want what Ralph was after? But when I saw that this was about helping Vanellope, I saw where it made sense. King Candy being silly throughout the movie and revealing his true identity and personality. Don't worry, I won't spoil it. I will admit though, much like \\"Toy Story 3\\", I thought the idea of humans unknowingly ending arcade game characters' lives was a bit frightening, especially King Candy's lie about Vanellope getting killed. That scene almost made me cry as well as Ralph destroying Vanellope's kart. But I am definetly glad Vanellope was cured in the end. I do wish this film got the Academey Award for Best Animated Feature. But hey, it did get the Annie Award for Best Animated Feature, so that has to count for something. Overall, I think \\"Wreck it Ralph\\" is a great CGI family film. What I think makes this stand out is Ralph and Vanellope's relationship. It is just heartwarming to watch.
B00168ML1G|3.0|Okay the discs, case and everything came in excellent shape....except....IT DIDN'T HAVE THE SLIPCOVER...was kinda disappointed when I saw it didn't come!!!
B00BI73CVI|5.0|The movie honors and stays true to the stage production, which is very important. The story is one that covers the range of human experience and the music lifts the story to inspirational heights.
B0092EE5HY|5.0|Love George R. R. Martin's writing style and his unbelievable imagination.<br /><br />I need nine more words for review, Amazon needs to change this requirement.
B002SHD9E2|5.0|This film is superb in its interpretation of Andrew Lloyd Weber's vision........AND they fixed most of the GLARING errors in the stage musical's plot.  Worth the watching.
B004EPYZU8|3.0|You really have to pay attention to separate the dream from the reality but I loved the plot and the ending. Some of the scenes did not make complete sense but still a good movie.
1573300403|5.0|Here's an awesome collection of great music videos from the King of Pop!  Well worth the price, and then some!
B004EPZ084|5.0|This movie was funnier than I expected. One of the funniest I have ever seen. I laughed from beginning to end and still use phrases from the movie in my every day conversations.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|Great product.  Many good game layouts and easy to use. Good appearance and it works well on my Kindle Fire.  I do recommend it to others.
B003Q6D25K|3.0|This is not as good as one or three but it still got my heart beat to quicken. You do need to see it if you want to see the others.
B004I744AS|5.0|I say fun because I open the dictionary app every morning even if I don't have a word to look up. It has a variety of enjoyable info and even games to play. Also its great to learn new words. Everyone should get this app especially because it's not just a dictionary, it is so much more!
B002VKE1K2|5.0|This movie is great because you do not know what is coming next. You are not sure if the terror comes when the actors are or are not expecting it. What happens when they are not looking is probably the best type of scary.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I've loaded this app on 2 phones and neither one will load the radar. What good is a weather app with the radar want load up. Piece of junk is what it is. Wish I could load the old version back it was slow but did work
B0050DIWFC|1.0|poor , only plot is setting up next book! I will not be buying it! nor will very many others
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Ken Follett never ceases to be a great storyteller. This was my second reading of the book. The first one was 30 plus years back. I did not remember many parts. It continued to thrill as ever. A wonderful story placed in World War II era. Romance twisted into the tale of spies and intrigue. Worth a read anyway
B004FRX0MY|5.0|i am so glad to be able to play music from both places on my phone now , i love it
B007PFDJH4|2.0|I didn't like this book.  There was too much sex in it, and the story line jumped around.  It was for a book club, and very few liked it or even finished reading it....a big disappointment!
B0094M6A18|5.0|Funny movie. May have to listen harder than normal but it's well worth it. Great comedy and worth the money.
034580404X|5.0|i love this trilogy it was a great read. if you looking for something else very similiar to this read i would recommend crossfire series it too is an awesome read
B00CEJ2EKE|5.0|What a badass record if your into vikings and norse mythology and Heavy Metal check out Amon Amarth for odin's sake

B000ICXQOM|5.0|For Raime, Campbell fans, this is a must see.<br />The last of the Evil Dead series and the most off the wall!
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|Great acting with a strong plot and cast. One of the few films both my girlfriend and I enjoyed!  Fun
B00BWJARHO|1.0|This movie is so long, and so redundant already. There will be three more. This makes the Lord of the rings trilogy seem brief.
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I feel that this game is too easy. But I guess you can only do so many that acan be solved.
B005LJITS0|1.0|Why did they even make a GL movie?<br />Seriously this is bad. Not a movie I can recommend to anyone.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My 8 year old really likes this game!!  Plays it all the time!  Saw it on her sisters phone and HAD to get it on the Kindle!
B0063IH60K|3.0|The game is fun. Interruptions of ads are too frequent.  There are times when you tap the screen and nothing happens.  Frustrating.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is super fun and easy to play. It's a little similar to temple run but a lot easier to control.
0307476464|5.0|This book does not introduce itself..It shows up and drags you in full force. Although well developed all the characters share a vagueness..that isappealing and mysterious. This book invaded my subconscious and leftme daydreaming when I was away from it. It is a riveting fantasy that introduces fresh concepts about reality, life and circumstance. I highly recommend this book to anyone who enjoys getting totally absorbed  and los in a great novel.
B004GYY714|5.0|Its great to discover new radio stations across the country. I managed to find many talk show hosts that left my area.
B0080SZ0V8|5.0|I found this game to be a good time waster. Thank goodness for the orbs that allow you to skip a puzzle because there was one puzzle I just couldn't solve. This game makes you think and that is good. The time element gives a sense of urgency which tested the nerves a few times. I enjoyed this game.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This is a great book. It's a story of life, love, and loss that we can all relate to on some level. Told by the one &#34;person&#34; who sees us at our weakest or maybe strongest moment.

B005544TRQ|5.0|Good show. First Season differently draws you in and keeps you wanting more. And they deliver! Glad I watched it.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|An incredible adaptation of the written works of George R.R. Martin and no wonder, he is involved with the production. Start here and get addicted real fast  . . .
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I actually use it daily.  It is pretty accurate and easy to use.  I check it first thing in the morning so I know how to dress for the day.  It never steers me wrong.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Can't think of a better fantasy TV show out there present or past. It's a high-budget series that delivers constant excitement, intrigue and a very friendly adaptation of the written works.
B00CRMX53S|5.0|Summer anthem of 2013? I think so. Even if Pharell Williams helped produce another Billboard #1 with Robin Thicke and some other guy.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|What's the point of getting this if you don't have the game? Its like a cheat sheet with no test. You cant do anything with that. We want the real Candy Crush Saga, not knockoffs or help guides, Amazon! Make it happen
0307730700|5.0|I read this cover-to-cover in two sittings. No way to describe the range of emotions this story elicits, but it's gratifying to know that such people still exist - flawed, human, and yet still possessing a depth of character worthy of emulating. So glad someone decided to tell this story.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is the second in the hunger games trilogy. It is an excellent book worth reading. I think that all the books in the trilogy are very good. Read this book! It's very good!
B000660UN0|5.0|I love everything about Clapton's work and this was the only stuff i did not have. So, i'm happy with it.
B00267N3DQ|2.0|This was advertised as 3 disc Blu Ray edition if Snow White and all I got was the blue ray disc. Not the DVD with the normal edition or the disc with the bonus features. I was ripped off for what I paid
B009MYARIK|5.0|I have read every single one of Sophie Kinsella's books and I love them all!  Such an entertaining read and so many twists and turns throughout the book you never know for sure how it will end.  I fully enjoyed every page of this book.
074356619X|2.0|I was hoping to learn something new especially I'm trying to shake things up in my life. However, there's not much you don't already know.
140006922X|5.0|There are many things to learn about Christianity from this book. One important revelation is the way in which religion, politics, slaughter, and assassination during the 1st C. affected the formation of what we now call Christianity. The author is very direct in concluding that very little is written about the actual life of Jesus. But by exploring what has been written in the context of the actual history of what was then Palestine and biblical references to Jesus, we get a good picture of what was happening just before his birth, during his life, and after his death. Toward the end it becomes clearer on how early Christian beliefs were supplanted with what then became the Roman Catholic Church. Although your present beliefs may not agree with this author's research, it is worth reading this book.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I was given 6 options for summer reading this year, one of those options was this book. I and all of my girl friends decided to read this one. this book was very inspirational and believable. it captures the story of two teenagers who are cursed with cancer at fairly young ages. it follows them through thier lives and really shows how it is like to grow up fightimg cancer. The Fault in Our Stars is well worth reading for any teenager, especially girls.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|A friend recommend this book/author.  I have to say that I really enjoyed it and look forward to his next book.
B004ADF7RO|5.0|Awesome every time I watch it! Why don't they make movies like this anymore! It always a lot if fun for the whole family.
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|Me, my spouse and the twins all loved this loved. A classic redone very well, with the right characters.<br />to play the right parts.
B0050KVCES|3.0|I bought this because there was a great deal on it and I was shopping for some vinyl to go with my new AT-LP120. The Mp3s I have of the Centennial Collection sound a bit better, but this is still a very enjoyable set. Sure, it's not like the original 78s, but it's cool to put on a Johnson record.<br /><br />Another minor complaint is that this lacks the alternate cuts of the songs which have 2 cuts. Thus, it's not truly complete. Since it lacks the alternate cuts, I have to deduct some stars from this. The Centennial collection is available on CD with better sound and is truly complete, so just get that. You can probably find it cheaper.

B0000T6JGU|5.0|I didn't know how much I'd like this album, but I definitely prefer it to the regular Let it Be. The vinyl itself is amazing sounding. Great dynamic range, very clear, life-like,  and is free of noise. The vinyl is thick as to be warp resistant as well.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|a gripping novel. in the usual taught style of grisham. could not put the book down till i came to the end.
B008XNPO20|5.0|Vinyl fans, attention! Chances are, if you're a vinyl collector you probably like a lot of 60s music, which means you probably dig The Beatles, Jimi Hendrix, etc. If this is the case, you'll love this band. Lonerism is a great album, and an improvement over their very good but not great debut Innerspeaker. The vinyl itself is great quality. Noise free, etc. The mastering is also an improvement over the CD version, with a bit better dynamic range (as is typical for vinyl masters).
B00338QELU|2.0|Mankell is a terrific writer, and his translator, Laurie Thompson, does a terrific job.  I loved his \\"Italian Shoes\\" and other digressions from the Wallander series.  And in TMFB he does a terrific job of weaving social and political \\"mini-essays\\" into a murder mystery.  But that murder mystery has such a sloppily-devised ending that I could easily believe that Mankell lost interest and asked his housekeeper to finish up the book for him.  To gripe about specifics would be spoiling, so I'll just leave it at that.  Yes, there are handy coincidences that propel the plot forward; it happens a lot in mysteries and if the writing is good and there's plenty of forward momentum such devices can be shrugged off.  But a truly lousy, nonsensical ending that posits the use of a completely mythical murder implement...sorry.  I feel betrayed.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Great app. I spend hours playing and never get tired. If you like coin, dinosaur, building, and/or mission games this is the game for you.
B001QURIYO|5.0|this album is unique and immensely enjoyable, and the musical creativity on display is remarkable. each number is a complex weave of musical styles and layered sound effects, yet the rock beat, harmonies and spirit are vibrant and captivating in every one. in the first number alone, bongos mix with tambourine, electric guitar with string orchestra, and honky tonk piano with gospel choir: amazingly, it hangs together beautifully. whatever mood i'm in, this music picks me up and takes me higher.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Lots of cameos and great fun to watch.  There are a lot of lines from cameo appearances referring to previous movies.  If you're looking for a realistic action movie - this is not it.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|This movie is difficult to follow at times (so make sure you've only had one glass of wine), but comes together nicely.  Interesting subject and characters.  I loved it.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Makes you really want to believe that love is real. I love this book it's unexpected love story. Great author
B000056HE9|5.0|I wasn't born when this movie was released.  Although it is in black and white and it is not contemporary, it is such a great little Christmas story with a moral to the story.  I have watched this movie many times throughout the years, and LOVE EVERY MINUTE OF IT!
B00CZAYL76|2.0|I haven't a clue who the other reviewers are on this list, but here's my 2.5 cents:<br /><br />1) I never cared too much about the use of vulgar language (I don't believe in censorship) in music until I listened to 2 Live Crew (back in the day) -- I can't help but think the same guy produced this 5FDP CD. Seriously now, how many times can one sing the F word in a single song (Burn MF)? Not to mention it flows like many Kiss songs...repeating chorus until your ears bleed. Maybe I'm getting too old for this, but I do know it's more than slightly overdone in just about every one of the songs on this CD. I get it, you're angry...try channeling that \\"energy\\" into something else...like better lyrics. Sadly, I cannot comfortably let my 11 year old (who absolutely loves 5FDP, BTW) listen to this CD...those of you who do, you oughta be ashamed. I can't imagine how the \\"clean\\" version of this CD will sound...prolly have to re-record the vocals on every song.<br /><br />2) Someone explain to me why all of these \\"guests\\" needed to be on the CD...I don't get it. Having a single song \\"featuring\\" another artist is more than enough for a band like 5FPD. Maybe if this were someone in the hip-hop world, I'd reconsider, but these guys don't need anyone \\"helping\\" them out with the vocals.<br /><br />3) The cover of \\"Mama Said...\\" is almost laughable...but, in all fairness, not nearly as bad as Hollywood Undead's rendition of Shout At The Devil (Motley Crue).<br /><br />Above:<br />Lift Me Up<br />Watch You Bleed<br />Dot Your Eyes<br /><br />Average:<br />I.M.Sin<br />Anywhere But Here<br /><br />Below:<br />Burn MF<br />Mama Said Knock You Out<br />...and the rest of them<br /><br />From an average rock band, this would be acceptable, but from 5FDP, I'm left feeling a bit of \\"meh\\" after listening to it 15-20 times.
B000000OQF|5.0|If I find the &#34;person&#34; who stole this from my collection, well, let's just say they'll have a hard time sitting down for awhile. Now that I replaced it in my collection, it's a good &#34;go-to&#34; CD when I'm needing my 80s fix of hair metal. Start to finish, it's an awesome compilation of wicked cool rock-n-roll.<br /><br />Kids, if your rents are from the 80s, get/play this as loud as you can -- just might make mom and dad want to get re-involved in your existence.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|Have become a huge fan of James Rollins books. Like the interweaving of science, adventure and great characters. Have spent the summer reading as many books as I can of his.
1609611543|5.0|It is very surprising yet not so surprising after reading this as to why there is such a weight issue in this country. It is enlightening and then makes you aware and able to decide where you want to go with your food choices after reading. Very helpful information.
B006M4F67A|5.0|Colors and clarity on screen make game enjoyable viewing. Appreciate the \\"undo\\" and \\"reshuffle\\" options to extend game play in each match. Thanks for this enjoyable and quality product.
B0080SZ0V8|2.0|I got this game as the faotd and I have slowly worked through it when I had the time.  I am almost done and SURPRISE I can not finish because the dart board in the birthday party level will not accept the number 6 at all.  I actually let the time run out so that it would reset.  I got all new numbers except for yep a 6.  Once again 6 is not accepted.<br /><br />Up until the glitches I would have rated this a 5.  I am glad that it was free for me and disappointed that I can not finish the game.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|All of Rollin's books are based on a great deal of scientific research.  This book is filled with excitement from cover to cover.  Fun to read about familiar SIGMA Force characters.  The end is a heart racer.  Even though you know that it will end  well (so to speak) you cannot put it down til it is over.  And that last chapter - that was a real head spinner.  It's a must read if you are  a Rollins fan.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Quick and sweet and bitter and leaves you dwelling on the cobwebbed memories of your childhood, bad and good.  I recommend reading while listening to Gaiman's excellent and heartfelt narration.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyable for both kids and adults! Great storyline and engaging characters! Looking forward to seeing the sequel before long!
B00457WZEI|2.0|Don`t like it humans make animals think like humans, because we dont`t know what they think,I don`t like humans talking for animals either.<br />I am sure it made a great movie, but I did not go see it either, not my kind of show. Back when Lassie and rin  tin tin, and flicka were made we knew the animals were trained to do all of the tricks, animals are pets and we love them, just sets my nerves on edge when a human tries to assume what the animals might be thinking, when the time comes that animals might say words and tell us what they think I will be long gone, and that is still a stretch, let the animals be our companions,when they really start thinking on their own we are in trouble. Sorry thats just my opinion.
B004PZ4HC8|5.0|Detailed, easy to read and scary as hell. This book actually gave me nightmares. It's MUCH better than the movie!
B004ZN9ERI|3.0|The disk is a good product, but it comes in a cheap paper &#34;case&#34; that is annoying to store along with other disks.
B008P1EWIM|4.0|TJust started using but so far, I like.  Set my cities for relatives, current city, and old hometowns.<br />Like the colorful background.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this game is a great way to make the waiting time go faster.  the cute and fun minions are easy to move around.
B00D6SBOWG|5.0|this is a great game.  interesting different and the gopher on the course laughs at your low score a lot.  a must try.
B004SRWW0C|1.0|I installed this app specifically because it supports Google drive but none of my files populate. Drop box works fine but Google drive Stays blank. Very disappointed.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I have gotten so many great recipes and ideas from Pinterest. I use it every day. I'm hooked. I would highly recommend it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|When I first started with this game,I expected it to last me a couple of days but three months later I'm still addicted to it.that probably tells you all you need to know.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|Great movie, lots of action and great special effects. This is definitely a must see movie if you are a marvel fan!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It's fun and a cool game. My little brother even likes it. I love the graphics in it. I've always wanted to get a game like this because we're I live we can't have horses. Really really really fun.
B00DU74U74|3.0|This movie is not int the same boat as Battlefield Earth, but still lacks dramatically when compared to the book.<br /><br />The movie stands ok on it's own ,but when you have read the book, you find a lot is missing.<br /><br />From the storyline itself, to the character development, they tried way to hard to cram it all together in one movie.  This book would have made a good two or three part series, or even a great mini series.  As it stands, they made a decent movie out of a great book.<br /><br />On a side note, if you are worried that this is at all like her vampire series, it's nothing like it in plot or style.  Both good IMHO. but nothing alike.
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|This app has all of the fun of a traditional Uno game. There are very few added rules that try to make it interesting but end up just making things too complicated. It's classic Uno fun.
B0055S348W|3.0|The User Interface is very ugly in the app but it gets the job done. Easy to print things from almost any app. Works great on Samsung Galaxy S3.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I signed in a account that I use but it wouldn't give me all my followers followings and it stayed with my old name but I can get them all back but it's going to be hard work
B005K17RU0|4.0|Accurate wx info. Upgrade made it a little more difficult to reference quickly. Love that they have wx broadcasters w/ wx maps just like TV.
B006S053K8|2.0|Terrible acting (as is to be expected from Kristen Stewart at least) and predictable teen-angst-filled plot line. Not worth the watch.
B0097K21YW|1.0|this game was no fun for me and i love a true time killer. i could not get the hang of it at all
8866135909|3.0|I've been using Moleskine notebooks for several years, even when I started veering towards Google calendar and other digital options. The ability to \\"brain dump\\" all your thoughts using pen and paper can't be beat. I owned this exact model a couple of years ago and had the \\"extra large\\" last year. Now that I'm back to to size \\"large\\", I wish I had upgraded in size. This moleskine planner lacks the traditional monthly calendar boxes and has a rather odd arrangement of horizontal lines labeled by the month. There is a lot of waste in the first part of the planner. Monday through Sunday is laid out on the left side of the planner, while the ruled side is on the right. This is a really nifty feature and I love the ability to take notes, but I find the actual planner side is too small for my needs.
B008MM9630|5.0|I say fairy farm is great game just to chill and relax to. my sisters and I enjoy playing this wonderful game.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I was concerned whether this could come close to The Kiterunner, but I thought it was almost as good.  Very worthwhile read from a great author.  Give us more.
B000OZ0NXA|4.0|VERY FORMULAIC BUT IT WORKS WELL...JACK IS A GREAT PROTAGONIST. EVERY MAN WISHES THEY WERE AS CONFIDENT AS JACK...I FOUND IT HARD TO PUT DOWN.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great graphics, easy to understand and move the guy around.<br />I have only played it a few times so far.
0061992860|5.0|The wealth of information in this book, mixed with it's tiny real estate, makes this a must have guide for camping, fishing, emergency kits, trucks, boats, campers, bug out bags, you name it. As far as reference material goes, this is about hte most Go-To book on Earth, get one and see why!
B00821PCJS|5.0|This show is amazing. The characters, the stories, the so-so effects that are still immensely satisfying. I watched the first two seasons in about a week thanks to amazon prime. And I paid for season 3 because I just couldn't stop. This is my new favorite show.
1599290634|4.0|The book itself is beautiful, but what do you expect from a collection of illustrations like this? I bought it as a gift for my artist boyfriend, so the content is wonderful; however I am disappointed with the extent of the damage on the front and back covers. For being a &#34;new&#34; book in &#34;excellent&#34; condition, it looks surprisingly like a college text book that has been making the rounds for the last couple years. Still, it's a beautiful collection of amazing artists that I have followed for several years now.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|love how they incorperated his son into it this time it's like watching a life story from 10yrs to 30 yr span( in the movie of course)
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|The drama was great as well as the storyline, very good movie, kids watched it over and over<br />and now want me to buy it lol.
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|james franco did a fabulous job at becoming the wizard we have come to know from the original , i could honestly see him 40 years from now hiding behind that curtain lol
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is a very competitive and addicting game, always leaves you wanting more, almost everyone I know likes this game and agrees it is awesome!
B0058VW36U|5.0|I was very bored so I was like hey cut the rope is fun why did I buy cut the rope because I am a fun person I like to play games
B008AIGWVA|5.0|U can talk with him on the phone,feed him, he will drink cider,u can go in his lab, he will burp, that's about it in a nut shell. But like all these apps, he will repeat what u say. I &lt;3 it! :-D
B0006AAS5G|5.0|Great price and quality. I would recommend this watch yo any one real nice feel to this watch looks awesome.  Buy it .....
B00AHJL7BK|5.0|It takes a little bit to get used to how this works (word of advice, the tutorial is extremely helpful). But once you do, this gets a ton of fun while still being challenging. The developers pointed out that you need to understand the rules of what works (i.e., if the number is 3, only 1&2 or 2&1 will work), and that helps. Playing is the best way to figure them out. You don't have to be a professional math guy, but it helps. I enjoyed this game waaaay more than I thought I would.
0307352153|5.0|A new, insightful perspective on what was seen to be a negative trait--&#34;shyness&#34;.  In fact, introversion is a necessary and valuable quality.  Comprehensive research.  Easy to read for a dense subject.  This truly changed my mind about the power of introversion.
1609611543|5.0|Your health depends on it. Everyone in the world should have to read it. It's knowledge that everyone should have to manage their health and well-being. Nobody should miss out on this information.
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|A truly effective plot grown from a rather odd concept. I loved this book from the first chapter and didn't put it down until it was over.  The protagonist has a delightful perspective filled with honesty and laughter. This book was a joy to read and made a point!a point that needs to be made.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Great game.. Can not wait for more levels. Easy but not too hard. My 6 yr old grandson had fun helping solve the levels.
B00B769XB8|4.0|Fun monster movie. Like able heroes<br />Good special effects.<br />Actors all great<br /><br />It was fun like some of the 50's cult classics
B003OUXECE|5.0|It was an extremely well written story. A perfect prequel to a perfect game. All the action, mystery, thrill and
B005DNPKSQ|5.0|This movie was wonderful and it great paired with the novel &#34;The Giver&#34; excellent imagery and imagination for everyone :)
B004FS1TLM|3.0|Of all the prior works, and I have them all, this one is a little lacking in the punch department.  It feels almost like a voice over, like the orchestra was left in the hall and he was in the studio with a sound track. After several listens to the entire album, its not bad as a back ground fill its just not front of the stage Buble'.  If you are looking for top Michael, move on to other works that he has done.
B00CDXOXB4|4.0|I loved it not like the book but its was good they fit a lot of thing with Jo that made more sense them the book witch I thought was cool will watch it again soon
B0012GTZC0|4.0|4.5 stars for this well written and developed story with good character development. you really get the sense of the time and tension of the situation. recommended.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is actually very good. I by far recommend this app for all ages, young or old. trust me on this, as I am very picky on what takes up gigabytes on my devices!
0399251944|4.0|One of the first lift the tab book series about Spot and still a favorite -- after the first two Spot book, however the tabs do repeat.
B004UID2LC|3.0|I really don't like it that much but its ok so yeah I get to whatch minecraft and stuff bye
0812983459|1.0|I can't stand it when authors know things about the plot and don't let you in on them until the end of the book to ensure a teary ending.  Such trickery.  So predictable.  Harold, despite this walk, is such a loser.  Was it about saving Queenie or was it about him?  Who cares.  Perhaps the author should go back to her day job.  All these years he couldn't find her to thank her for taking the rap for him?  Why did we not find about all this as the story was being told?  What was the motivation for doing what he did to begin with?  Why is all this so unbelievably hokey?  No backbone to stand up to the hangers-on.  Just about the worst book I've read lately.  I know I'm in the minority and I'm proud of it.
B00AMBH70S|4.0|Saw it again for the 4th time just keeps getting better!  Lots of action! Will see Again, not many movies make that Grade! This one definitely has the it factor for me!
B005HSL626|5.0|this game is fun for all ages and is better cut the rope and its the best game I have ever pleyed
B0061S0A64|2.0|I got this as the faotd and right away I had some glitches with it.  I had to open it three times, the first two it opened and then closed right away on its own.  Once it was open, I attempted to play with it.  With no instructions, I just played around.  I put out a large number of nodes and suddenly my whole Kindle shut down.  (battery not dead)<br /><br />I have deleted this app and have had no further issues with my device.
B002RTMXIY|5.0|I'm not gonna write a very long review. This movie is really good, go ahead check it out you won't be disappointed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game but when you have to get the symbols its annoying when they're sitting there and theres no way to get them. Its agrivating.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Dan Brown's novels give me so much information about art, science, history, politics and human consciousness, that when I complete them, I am in awe! I wish I had an idedic memory and could store it in my brain like his character Robert Langdon.
0307276902|5.0|I don't care whether it's autobiographical or fiction; this is one of the best books I have read.  Truly a gripping tale of the effect of the demons which claim some of our loved ones.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I bought the series for a gift for a family member. They love the movies and wanted them to keep for future watching.
B00993FEUK|4.0|Enjoyed the story, nice to see a change from the computer generated animation that is out there.  Not a family friendly movie from some of the references made.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|The cover is nice. It fit perfectly. I highly recommend this for any Kindle Fire owner. I does protect the screen very well!
B003UYUR10|4.0|All around, an entertaining movie for the family.  Purchased this option because the digital copy that would allow use on the families' electronic devices.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|I have been using the Chromecast since two days after it came out, and I have to say that it not only has enormous potential, but is already a more than functional device.<br /><br />A little about this way I watch TV- I have been \\"untethered\\" for more than a year, using only Hulu, Netflix and occasional purchases from Amazon and Itunes to fuel my tv habit, and I don't intend to look back. I have had a lot of interaction with Apple TV, and I am a pretty high-level user. More importantly, I use my computers as an educational tool, to project the internet and presentations in front of my classroom. In my opinion, the Chromecast delivers a nearly equal (if not better) experience than the Apple TV, and for a third of the price.<br /><br />Many have said that the Chromecast (and particularly its Beta features) do not work well without good internet. I couldn't say. I can say, however, that with decent internet, there are none of the issues that I've had with other streaming devices, such as pauses to buffer, or mismatched sound. (My current internet is not the best, which I know well from having Verizon Fios and lightning speeds for the last two years, but it more than sufficient for day to day netflix and rarely has hiccups.) This is not only for direct Netflix or Youtube streaming, but also for mirroring of Chrome webpages, and even videos.<br /><br />Some features haven't been loudly advertised, but should be.<br /><br />Features of the device, in order of facility:<br /><br />1) Direct Netflix, Youtube and Google Play streaming.<br /><br />  The way this works is that you use your computer or phone as a sort of remote control. I've only tested it with Mac products (Laptop, iPhone and iPad), and they have all worked beautifully. The best thing about this is you device doesn't have to be on for anything but pressing play! No lost battery power or tied up devices, which puts it at the same level as AppleTV for streaming, and with Google's more open developer philosophy,we should be seeing many more streaming services adapt their apps for this feature soon. It goes beyond the Apple TV, Wii and other devices in that it works through native apps and devices with keyboards, making the selection of a movie or TV show a far less annoying process.<br /><br />2) Chrome(browser) Casting.<br /><br />  When in Chrome you are able to press a button on the top right hand part of your screen and reflect anything in Chrome to your tv. Again, this for me was without hiccups or lags, despite many reviews claiming that this process is slow and jumpy, I have found it quite the opposite. The downside of this is that your device must be on to stream its content to the TV, and that there is not yet support for this for iPhones and iPads (it worked great on my Mac laptop), but I'm sure it will come soon, and this is no different again to mirroring or streaming content through an Apple TV. The upside is that Chrome supports the streaming of movies from all (as far as I can tell) the major streaming sites, and so you can project Hulu and the like with no trouble by pulling it up in your browser. The cherry on the cake (or, actually the meat in the pie) is that Chrome also supports the playing of all sorts of media, including MP3 and MP4, which means that by (on a Mac), selecting \\"open with\\" and choosing Chrome (you need to specify that you want more than just supported applications available to open with on newer macs), you can stream all files except for AVI to your TV as well, with perfect picture and perfect sound, at least on my connection. There is an issue with Quicktime only streaming video but not sound that I have not yet seen worked out.<br /><br />3) Computer Casting<br /><br />  This is the feature everyone is claiming that the Chromecast doesn't have- but it does! It is in a highly experimental mode, but I have had no troubles, freezes or hiccups trying it. When you go to the ChromeCasting menu in the Chrome browser, there is a small, grey,barely visible arrow in the top right hand corner of the menu. Click on that and you have the option to mirror your whole screen, not just a Chrome tab. Fair warning, this projects only image and not sound, unlike casting a browser window, but as a teacher this will prove the most valuable thing about the device. Being able to project your computer to a classroom screen is one of the reasons Apple TV has been so successful in educational purchases, but now a device has arrived with the same functionality- the same ability to project a power point presentation or a website to your students- at a third of the cost! The feature may be in beta testing now, but it is available, and I imagine it will only get better and more stable. I was not able to convince my administration to shell out $100 per classroom for an Apple TV, but I am sure they will have no problem with a $35 device that does the same. It costs less than a Mac to VGA cord for a wired projection interface.<br /><br />I want to get the word out that these features are there, because I think Google has been selling itself short. If you have been on the fence about getting a streaming device for your TV, I think Google has just come up with a major contender.
B00A7OJ0DC|5.0|Absolutely love this movie, great story, unique concept, and being a gamer, nice to see old, familiar faces in it.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it's just challenging enough and keeps you engaged, even as an adult. Definitely makes time to by quickly if you're looking to distract yourself with a puzzle.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|It is no secret; I am getting older so tried this game to see how well I could reason...  Great game and frustrating at the same time.  I would recommend it to anyone who thinks at all.  Old or young; this one is a keeper.
B004QX07G4|5.0|I enjoyed every page of this book. Laughed out loud many times. Could hear Ellen's voice in every word I read.
1451626096|5.0|After reading other reviews, I was very surprised that others thought that Elizabeth of York was a weak character and didn't enjoy the book as much as I did. On the contrary, I thought Gregory did an amazing job portraying just what an impossible position Elizabeth of York was in - basically ostracized from her mother and York family who are plotting against her husband, while married to her husband who views her as a likely enemy whenever there is a plot against him linked to members of her family. In this world of intense suspicion that is ruled by men, what options does Elizabeth of York have? Any reason to suspect her could have her imprisoned in the Tower, put aside by her husband never to see her children again, or beheaded. I don't believe this was a weak woman. Actually, this was a woman who was raised by strong women, who was probably used to having her own way, and who suddenly finds that she has very few options to exercise any power or exert much influence over her family or her husband or her domineering mother-in-law. Meanwhile, she cannot acknowledge that \\"the boy\\" who will either overthrow her husband and sons or likely be executed is possibly her little brother. This was a woman in impossible circumstances, and I thoroughly enjoyed how Gregory portrayed her story, as well as how the story of the princes in the Tower may have played out. If you're looking for a book that ties up all the loose ends with a big happy bow, then you will probably not enjoy this book, or any other book on the English royal history, because that is unfortunately not how things worked out for most of these families. I loved the book.
B004SJ3BCI|1.0|It states &#34;free&#34; and then you start to play and they want $$$$.  Don't advertise &#34;free&#34; if it isn't.  Total Rip Off.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|One of the best games. It is so much fun to play and very very very addicting. I just cant get enough. Ive been playing it for about a heat. I will delete it and buy it again just so I can play it some more.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I love the connections between all the characters, the masterful  use of language. After the initial Div story, the stories seemed disjointed and fragmented until Nabi's letter to Markos.<br />Overall, I was thrilled. Great writing!
B00D41AJ7G|4.0|The only problem is that it is too easy for adults :) it is more a kiddo game.<br />I finished all the levels y one single night
B000I5SY9Q|5.0|A very funny parody of television, and its effect on society, but unfortunately too true for comfort. A thought provoking tome.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It was the most popular game I think so you should get it because I mean what I say so get it and you will believe me so trust me I know what I'm talking about
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Love the CD.  Disappointed in the DVD because I can't play it in my receiver.  I can't use Blu Ray and so I didn't order Blu Ray.  But since my receiver is older, it won't play the DVD.  I guess that's not the fault of the DVD and so I did not decrease the rating I gave the product.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great book. Will read again. I love the trilogy. All three are amazing. I only wish the story continued. I own the hard copies and Kindle versions.
B002M9WW30|5.0|It is nice to have the whole set together. These are must see movies for anyone who likes sports. Classics for generations to come.
B000W93CHC|5.0|Any book by Ken Follet is worthwhile reading. I just wish he could write them faster.  Can't wait for the next one.
0061801313|5.0|Keeps you guessing who A is and who the murderer is.  If you love a good murder mystery you will love it.
B0041D843M|5.0|This is an awesome book.  A real eye opener.  I was shocked!  This is the best book on all the major diseases and nutrician, there is, out there.  Also the truth about all the misinformation on diets and nutrician as well as on diseases.There are too many studies backing the information in this book to ignor it.
B00DEG4Z1W|4.0|She loves to have her own play salon, so this was perfect app for her.  She really loved it!  Thanks
B00DQVSTCG|5.0|The show is completely breath taking!!! It really capture the essence of the live performance but you feel like you are watching a movie at the same time. The Journey of a lost soul in the darkness coming to the light. It's also incredible to see people of all ages singing to the songs, Madonna keeps touching souls whether it is remembering your teenage years or learning your way through life, very emotional and extremely entertaining.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this app. it's very much a temple run type game, but it makes me smile a lot more, even when the little guy dies. I find myself playing it more often than temple run because there's more variety &amp; it's more light-hearted.
B00BRUQ7ZY|1.0|This man is a apostate and then claims to go back to being a muslim.  Aslan maybe a professor but he is a great liar........
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is awSome if u have'nt played it then play it is awsome u think it  is boring but it isnt Love it,like it,review it!!!!!<br />E
B00BH0VSM6|5.0|Now I know what the later books refer back to, in Harry Hole's past life as a detective.<br />I wish Jo Nesbo's second book, The Cockroaches, was translated; so I could read them all in order.  After reading the Snowman (his first I read) which was the 6th in the series; I'm trying to read them in order.
B0091THRCU|5.0|For the price, this case exceeded my expectations. The quality and craftsmanship are great. The case holds my i5 perfectly and securely. It's not bulky at all. It is exactly what I was looking for!
B009XIXVU6|3.0|I'm became a fan after Kite Runner and enjoyed A Thousand Splendid Suns even more. I guess my hopes were set high with the third novel but it was my least favorite. There were too many characters and the story jumped around so much at times it was difficult to follow, yet predictable.  Lets hope the next (4th) story improves. Overall - not bad.
B004TI5N38|4.0|Very good military investigation story. Puller is down to earth and methodical as he investigates a murder of a family.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|This is a great series and PBS has done a great job.  Hope to see many more like this.  Just wish it was easier to find the episodes in sequence.
B003Q6D2B4|5.0|This movie was awesome. It had great stars great action and red two was even better. Would recommend both movies to anyone
B009D0LBRO|1.0|When I pay for a game I expect no ads, why am I getting ads when I pause the game and during the title screen? Really? Why did I pay for the app then? Terrible!
0307956350|4.0|This is a great book for the plane, the layover, and the beach.  Particularly on a European vacation, given the subject matter.  The Expats is a light spy thriller that plays with the conventions of the genre and moves at a brisk pace.  Couldn't help but imagine which Hollywood stars will be in the sure-to-come film adaptation.
B004W2UBYW|4.0|I'll admit, I was very impressed by this book and wish I had picked it up sooner. Very well written and I'll say if the author's writings about Steve Jobs are even 50% true and I had to pick a word to describe the man I would have to go with &#34;inspiring&#34;. Great job Mr. Isaacson!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This is so addictive and I can't put it down!! Don't get this if you need to go to work lol
0770437400|4.0|Great book.. so much better than the movie. But read the book first, not the same at all..recommend it highly.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so fun :) its like a combination of subway surfers and temple run and it adds its own type of style like the mini games its Awsome.
B0048KXRR6|5.0|It's great entertainment plus a lot can be learned from this product.One for  the whole family to enjoy and even discuss things in their own family that could be improved.

B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|Best album I've coped this year def put all the sophomore slump bs to rest, Cole is probably the closest thing I've heard to the legends from the 90s in the last few years
B006CEKZ4Y|5.0|Wonderful movie, really enjoyed the extras inluded.  Don't know if it's the bet movie of all time, but very enjoyable!
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Continues the Downton Abbey Saga with surprising twists in the middle and in the season end. The unfolding story keeps one involved. Waiting for Season 4.
B005COO1X6|4.0|Did like the book although short,  kept me guessing and kept me reading to the end, was suspenseful and enjoyable.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Deserves the accolades it has received world wide. If you are looking for period drama, give this one a shot, along with Season 1 and 3.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This makes my Kindle even more handy!  Easy and intuitive to use, and I don't get forced to read an ad before I use it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|Good, easy, fast read. Hard to put down. Recommend to anybody that likes detective stories. If you don't like staying up late, don't start reading at bedtime.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I have always loved my iPhone weather channel app. When I got my Kindle the weather channel app was one of the first I downloaded. I guess I expected it to work just as well, but it doesn't. I have a very hard time getting the radar maps to load. This is a huge disappointment to me. I was looking forward to using the bigger screen to keep track of storms, I live in Iowa, and storms can turn deadly quickly.<br /><br />I'm also not a fan of the latest update. I don't know what that &quot;claim your points&quot; thing is about. I just know it gets in my way when I try to do things. I also find the new update less user friendly. I'll stick with my iPhone app I guess.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Grew up reading this and just finished reading it to my 6-year old! Once a king or queen in Narnia, always a king or queen!
1573229725|4.0|This book is definitely an entertaining page turner. The plot twists and turns and the author does a good job of creating the setting of another time and place. Some aspects of the storyline are superfluous, but it is all in good fun.<br />If you liked this book, try &#34;Remaining in Provincetown&#34; by S.N. Cook.  It also has some interesting characters and a plot twist.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A very inspiring book.  Very believable and encouraging and convincing for those of us who doubt the existence of an afterlife
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this my horse app is pretty cool. its not expensive and it works good. I love horses and this app.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|I find this app to be very helpful, I watch very little TV so getting up and turning it on is not part of my daily routine. This app allows me to quickly find out the weather no matter what city I'm in.
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Shadowfever was a satisfying conclusion to an exhilarating and wild ride! The Fever series was the perfect combination of original, gripping, paranormal storyline with an epic kicka$$ heroine/anti-hero romance.<br /><br />Since there are tons of reviews and the major plot points are fairly well known; I will confine my review to my final impressions.<br /><br />Mac - I liked the 1.0 free-spirited, pink wearing, accessorizing version because even at her most vapid, the gal had chutzpah and enough spunk to not back down from a fight. I love the 5.0 hardened, worldly, warrior version. She is an equal to Barrons in every way.<br /><br />Barrons - JZB was everything everyone said he was. The ultimate alpha/gamma hero that kept Mac a little off balance wondering if he was going to kill her or...kiss her at any given time.<br /><br />V'lane and DEG - Whoa. I really did NOT see any of that coming.<br /><br />Darroc - I ended up liking him. I wanted he and Alina to have their happily ever after and all the while wondered if that was wrong...what with the 2/3 of the earth's population and all.<br /><br />Rowena - I totally did see that coming.<br /><br />Barrons merry band of 8 - Lor is intriguing, Ryodan is annoying and Fade has the coolest, sexiest name.<br /><br />Christian and the Keltars - Meh. I've not read the Highlander series and I can't say this provided any inspiration.<br /><br />Dani - Could she possibly be anymore annoying?? It's not simply that she's 14 and that I have a low tolerance for children; but she's an immature 14. \\"The Mega\\"??? Who besides a 5 year old gives themselves a nickname? Her voice is like nails on a chalkboard with her peeps and troubs and dude and her own personal brand of Irish/American Ebonics. I cannot believe I am going to have to suffer through 2 books of her grating narrative to get to more Mac and Barrons.<br /><br />K'vruck and the Royal Hunters - Remind me of really big, really smart dogs and I want one. They are seriously cool and Mac has to stop Jayne and his men from hunting them. And when Ryodan gets really full of himself, Mac needs to remind him that all she needs to do is say the word and she can give him a good K'Vrucking.Mac has to stop Jayne and his men from hunting them.

B000FBJF6Y|5.0|This is an excellent read especially for middle school students.  Besides being a non-typical mystery, there is cultural sharing is a down-home manner.
B007ZXK08C|4.0|Very good read. Unusual style of writing. Took me some time to get used to it. Would give i 5 stars, except for the ending. I found it very disappointing
B00364K6YW|5.0|I cannot say enough of this production of &#34;Pride and Prejudice.&#34;  I have loved it since I first saw it.  The actors are phenomenal.  The story is one of love, respect, class attitude, family, and honor.  Our society would be well served to pay attention.
0062255657|1.0|I'm not a big reader, but when I do read, I like a page turner.  Mystery, suspense, adventure...but this was just plain old bizarre.  Maybe it just wasn't my thing.  It was definitely more sci-fi than I had anticipated.  And I wouldn't call it an adult fairytale either.  I couldn't finish it, I have other books that I have more interest in starting than I have interest in finishing this one.
B00D41AJ7G|5.0|Once in a while a game comes along that is complete different and unique. Angry Birds was like that (the original) and this is too. Definitely worth it!
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Hidden object game for the family to play. Lots of fen for all. Hints make it easier when your  stuck.  I gave it a 4 only because I have so many that are longer. Great game!
0140177396|5.0|In John Steinbeck's, \\"Of Mice and Men,\\" two men, (one who is mentally challenged) work together as a dynamic duo throughout the entire book. They travel about to find a job and many stunning things happen when they find the job. The men always stick together even if the fight sometimes. The book shows what people would be like in the 1800's and I highly recommend it to anyone who is looking for a good book to read.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I had so much fun playing this game. I can't wait for as one new levels to be added. My biggest complaint is that it's too short.
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|Love this game, especially the arcade level that challenges you to reach the next level, and the sound affects are great.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|What a great imagination Riggs has!  Wonderfully woven story.  Hope someone makes this into a movie. I look forward to more  from this writer.
B00BJKZVRC|4.0|I wanted to purchase one of the new Doors SACD releases, to see if it would blow me away.<br />I'm noting the quality of sound, not the songs/performance.<br />It's not easy for me to make a judgement call on this SACD. I do not have the redbook version, nor the vinyl.<br />This is one of the lowest volume SACD that I have ever heard. You will need to seriously turn up your system's volume.<br />Some folks view this s a good aspect, because they say it most likely replicates the analog source level. And, there is the whole volume war concerning remasters in the MP3 age. I tend to like a little volume, and I wish this had more volume, and it bothered me somewhat.<br />Based on this, the SACD did not blow me away. But, it is a worthy buy, if this is one of your favorites.<br />Consider the DVD-A version.
B008XK69S6|4.0|I love the app the only little problem is that i don't have place for the title of the video. I will love to see the name, now i'm gessing
B00B7Y0206|3.0|it works like it say it is so therefore what is the complaint really? it is your typical u tube
B008RA3X5E|3.0|Works for alarm and music and sounds, but you better leave your kindle plugged in overnight while using it as it zaps power in about 7 hours.  It is easy to use, however.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It is simple. And works. And quality is excellent. And I'm about to pick up another one for the bedroom. Honestly, even without the extra content that is coming, this device has changed how I watch TV - I can't stop sending content from my phone to the big screen even as I own 3 Roku devices. Another not-so-obvious advantage, related to the simplicity of the device, is that anybody can just break out their phone (be it iOS or Android), and just play YouTube vids or whatever else on your screen. I had a friend over the other day and he wanted to show me something on YouTube, and did just that! And yet another PLUS is the device's portability - take it on the road and watch stuff in a hotel (most hotels now have HDMI equipped TVs). I will be taking it with me on the road this weekend, actually. Just pick it up when it is back in stock.
B008LV8TSU|5.0|I'm in my early 60's and haven't read a young person's book since the Harry Potter series. I thoroughly enjoyed it.
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey at her best. Honest and real and so, so funny. I could not put the book down. She is the real deal.
