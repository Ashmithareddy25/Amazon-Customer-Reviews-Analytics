B0010YSD7M|5.0|This is just another fantastic Stargate SG-1 movie.  It is as exciting as the series if not more exciting.  I am really glad to see Vala back though I missed Jack.  But Vala and Cam do a good job of replacing Jack. It was also good to see that the directors let Vala look beatiful as well as Sam.  The pigtails did not show up which I thought was good.  The plot did not lag at all. There was plenty of action. This was a great movie and cannot wait for the next one.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|a great looking film and well done storyline!  great outside camera work,and the Special effects look  like they came from a 50 million movie and not a TV  show. a excellent job of ending the major story line  from the last season,just wished they could have cleaned  up some of the remaining \\"B\\" storylines.    all in all very well done,can't wait for Stargate Continuium  this summer with Richard Dean Anderson back as Gen O'Neill !

0684874350|4.0|For some reason, and I don't know why, I had it in my head that Angela's Ashes was about Frank McCourt and his brothers returning to Ireland as adults and fumbling about as they tried to decide how to dispose of their cremated mother's ashes.<br /><br />It's not.<br /><br />Angela's Ashes is actually a memoir essentially detailing Frank McCourt's life from the age of three through nineteen.<br /><br />Born into a life of poverty, McCourt's immigrant parents decide to return to Ireland.  Unfortunately, conditions are actually worse for them in Ireland.  Add to the equation that McCourt's father is an alcoholic who thinks nothing of drinking away what little money they come across while his family starves ... well, the book gets more than a little depressing.<br /><br />And that's the real magic of McCourt's writing.  For as awful as things are (and they get pretty awful), McCourt's wicked sense of humor has you laughing at things that shouldn't be the least bit funny.  I actually felt guilty at times as I couldn't help but chuckle at McCourt's description or use of dialogue.<br /><br />Make no mistake, however, like in his memoir Teacher Man, McCourt does not try to deceive us into thinking he's the hero of the story.  He's tough on everyone, but he's toughest on himself.  He reports to us misdeeds and lewd thoughts that most of us would never dream of sharing, and that sort of honesty is quite refreshing.<br /><br />Though funny, the book was also so disturbing (especially McCourt's father) that I really wanted to get through it as fast as I could.  I absolutely appreciate both McCourt's humor and charismatic writing, but I won't lie to you and say this was one of my favorite reads.  But, life is hard and disturbing for many people, and my perspective of the world improved thanks to the Pulitzer Prize winning Angela's Ashes.<br /><br />~Scott William Foley, author of [[ASIN:0595360823 Souls Triumphant]]
B000N4SHPS|5.0|You may have never seen the original Rocky in 1976. That was when you still had to go to the theatre to see a first run flick.  If you do remember the film, then if you ever hear \\"Gonna Fly Now\\" the image of a nobody, striving to become a somebody comes to the fore.<br /><br />Fast forward 30 years to when this nobody has become a somebody, and now is sliding back into to used to be a somebody.  This is where we find Rocky.  Old, retired, frustrated at what was, what is, and what could have been.<br /><br />The scene where Rocky tells Paulie of the beast within now that Adrian has gone, and his need to let it out is pure glory.  We all have only so many days in our lives to get out that which lies within, before our breathe is stilled.<br /><br />One last shot, not at glory, not at winning, not at taking the prize..., but one last shot at knowing what it truly means to still feel something, to be alive, and to know that it isn't over until it's over..., that is what Rocky Balboa is all about.<br /><br />Highly Recommended.<br /><br />Cheers!
044024238X|2.0|What a silly book!  I love Kinsella's other books, particularly the Shopaholic series, but geez...the situations in this book are laughable (and not because they're funny).  Although I made it through the book, it was not a pageturner and I was not drawn in by the characters or situations.  Even if you're a fan of Sophie's like I am, skip this one.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Persuasion is my favorite Jane Austen story and I am very thankful that at least this book got a great adaptation on film.     Amanda Root was just so perfect for the role. Anytime I read Persausion, I see her as Anne Elliot. As Anne changes before the viewer's eyes, Root changes somehow that is noticeable to the audience and makes it seem flawless and real. Ciaran Hinds as Wentworth cannot be matched either. The two acted very well together and did the Austen classic justice. The supporting cast also portrayed the supporting charcters true to the book.     This version is the best one out there, thus far. Any fan of the book Persuasion should at least give this one a try and see for yourself. Coming from someone whose favorite Austen book is Persuasion, I was not disappointed one bit. It actually made me love the book even more.
0385338724|4.0|Another great book by Kinsella--I couldn't put it down and spent a whole day on the couch.  I subtracted one star simply because it's hard for any of her other books to measure up to the Shopaholic. :)
B000Z27HLS|5.0|I am a huge Jane Austen fan, and I have never seen a good movie version of Northanger Abbey before. The 80s BBC version did not capture any of the humor or sarcasm, and Mr. Tilney creeped me out. This version does a very good job keeping as much of Jane Austen's wit as is possible (some of the funniest parts of the book just can't translate to film). I would definitely recommend this movie to any Jane Austen fan.  (Oh, and J.J. Feilds as Mr. Tilney being quite nice to look at didn't hurt the movie at all!)  :)
0517118297|1.0|Jane Austen's work is incomparable...however, this particular edition is certainly NOT complete.  The first 3 chapters in \\"Emma\\" are missing.  A bit disconcerting as her characters and themes are developed from the first sentence...and unless you know the story, you are quite lost as you begin reading in the pages just before Chapter 4.  In answer to your question, \\"what would you have wanted to  know before you purchased the product???\\"  Sure would have like to know that it wasn't the \\"complete\\" novels.
B000002UAO|5.0|If every generation undergoes a Beatles faze I'm definitely riding this wave out for life! Just bought a huge chunk of The Beatles catalogue and I have to say Rubber Soul is the top-notch Beatles caliber. You have their signature harmony stamped all over this great album and they exemplify that best in 'Nowhere Man' and 'You Won't See Me' The Beatles have an achingly good tempo-switching bent which they express greatly in songs like 'The Word' and 'Wait' But any listener will be able to sink in the soothing ballads of 'Michelle' or 'In My Life' and sing along to the people-pleasing 'Drive My Car' But look out for 'Girl' I think they capture this entire mood really well. So Buy This Album (I totally recommend!)
B0014I4KH6|4.0|Wow   I like Taylor Swift's cd because her songs that she wrote herself are written well. Of course the songs that the other people write are good too. Then when she sings the song she must practice a lot because you can understand what she is singing. Unlike some other singers I know.    I think she needs to have some different songs instead of all about boys. It gets a little out of control. I'm not saying she can't have any about boys it is just about ten songs in a row are all about guys. Mabey some about her furture or the past. It would sound nice if she sang a couple different songs.   Taylor's song Tim Mcraw is a great song so is picture to burn. Treadrops on my guiater is good wounder where she came up with it. My favorite is our song would not understand why no one would like it.   I do recommond this cd. Not only to children but to adults. If you don't like her songs or something is annoying you about her. I'll recommond Kelly Pickler.
B00012L786|4.0|Great job...great actor...he will be missed!  Seeing this one, plus Kiss of Death, and then The Bedford Incident will give you a good overview of R.W.'s talent and his contribution to acting over the years.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|This was very disappointing. There's not much else to say about it. The acting was bad, the movie was a spin off of Aliens, and it was just too predictable. I kept having to ask myself \\"is this really a Stephen King movie?\\" because it kept reminding me of those \\"B\\" rated cheap horror flicks.<br />If you like cheap, \\"B\\" rated, gruesome, bloody, chop em up and show all type horror flicks.. you'll love this one.
0143038419|5.0|This is one of the best books I have ever read. I have passed it on to two people and they both agree.
1559211407|5.0|I discovered this book on a dusty HS library shelf and as in Ms. Hanff's words, devoured it \\"all at once\\" not coming up for air or cigarettes.  I also bought the VHS many years ago as soon as it came available.  Since then, I've gone on to go out of head for Donne, Quiller-Couch, Austen, and Blake (though not anywhere near Donne!).
B000PFUA9G|5.0|Brad Paisley has become one of my favorite artists over the past few years.  Combining his talent on the guitar with witty songwriting and an above average voice, he has recorded another wonderful album.

B000Q6GUW0|4.0|Hey,      Dexter is a very rivating series. It has a hint of C.S.I./Bones kinda feel to it but in my opinion a much better story line throughout the season. The difference between dexter and other crime series is that dexter himself is a murderer but only to the people who themselves have been bad. This series as i said also has a bigger main role through-out the season that is well set and always focused on. The bestpart to this show is the major jaw dropping twists that arrive into the season midway and at the end. This is a DVD series to be put in your collection
B0012GVKW8|3.0|While the movie itself is a pretty good action sci-fi flick that has a not-so-subtle commentary on the 80's action hero phenomenon, this disk is not. You get no extra features for one. Another thing to consider is the movie on this disk is going to be grainy. That's not a fault of the transfer so much, though the movie is encoded in mpeg2. The movie was filmed in the Super 35 (grainy format) using Kodak film (that was also grainy). Aside from color separation the difference in resolution won't be that big. Still it's likely the best looking transfer you will ever see for Predator.     Now I've been getting different reports on the audio. Amazon is saying all you get is English 5.1 DTS-HD (lossless audio), but I have been getting reports the disk will also have English Dolby Digital 4.0, French Dolby Stereo and Spanish Dolby Mono. I'm also getting conflicting reports on subtitles where Amazon is saying English and Spanish subtitles while I hear you will also get English SDH, Korean and Chinese.     With all these misreports it makes me wonder if there is another release on the horizon. Either way I would wait for and get the mess of extras that came on the Special Edition DVD instead of the single disk with just the grainy movie. That's right. All you get is a theatrical trailer on this release and the fact the disk is D-Box ready (that's a motion control system installed inside a chair so it moves and shakes to events in a movie or video game... don't see many people having this in their living rooms).     Verdict? I say wait. They WILL release a blu-ray version with a score of extras if for no other reason than the fact they already made one on DVD.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|If you like early 90's and 80's REM, this CD is the one for you.    I have listened to Accelerate three times in as many days.... each time I listen to it, I like it more.    Sounds from New Adventures in Hi-Fi, Automatic FTP, and even Fables of The Reconstrucion run through this album.  This is a true follow-up to the New Adventures CD.  Listen to the samples - if you like them, and appreciate REM from the 80's and 90's, you will not be disapointed in purchasing Accelerate.    Interesting is that I can't find a true \\"single\\" on this album... no \\"Stand\\", or \\"Man On The Moon\\" or \\"End of the World....\\".  Frankly, I like it that way.  Hit singles are overrated (though hit singles get downloaded more on I-Tunes...)
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I bought these headphones after much searching on the Internet. Like most of the reviewers, I agree, they are awesome!  I use them for medical transcription at home, but music is even BETTER!  They can almost be too good for MT, but I am very happy with their quality and comfort.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I am not a big sci-fi fan. I am not a big western fan. So when I heard about the plot for Firefly I was NOT interested. But at my husband's urging, I watched it. And within 10 minutes, I fell in love (okay, just the theme music got me). And then I wanted to kill my husband when he said it was off the air and only had 12 episodes!<br /><br />This is simply one of THE very best shows I have EVER seen. Excellent writing. Excellent cast. Excellent humor. Excellent drama. Excellent music. Need I go on?
B0013D8LOU|4.0|It's the most horrifically violent musical available on the market today.<br /><br />Besides maybe \\"Cannibal, the Musical.\\"<br /><br />It met my expectations exactly. It's visually surprising and stunning. It has good tunes. It's funny. It's bizarre, shocking and disgusting.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed it! :)
B00006CXGH|5.0|This was indeed one of the last cold-war films that I can recall.  The premise, that Soviet sleepers of many years could be called up for espionage, is played out with Mr. Poitier as the FBI agent working to foil the Soviets.  I have only seen River Phoenix in this movie, yet he is masterful; it's such a shame his personal life was so tragic.  I hadn't seen this movie in more than 10 years when I purchased the DVD.  I found myself transfixed as I had in the movie theater originally.  The two actors playing the sleepers were terrific, though I can never remember their names. Recommended.
B000N6TYLW|4.0|Gilmore Girls is my favorite show. But I can tell in the last season that it was written and directed by someone else. It isn't as quick and clever as the years prior, and there were camera shots that I never saw before. Over all I still love the show and the actors that make it as good as it is.
0767836324|5.0|This is a great film for the whole family, they definitely don't make movies like this any more.
0399230033|5.0|There isn't a lot of new vocabulary to learn through this book, but it is so much fun and I think it will really grow with your child.  The illustrations are bright and the story is cute.  My 13-month old has loved it from day one!
B000N6TYLW|4.0|I can't wait for a reunion show would the WB ever coordinate that?  It would be awesome of the entire cast were guests on the Actors Studio I would pay to see Lipton interview the quick witted fast talking Gilmore Girls!
0452289963|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's A New Earth is quite simply an awesome roadmap to understanding who we are and why we are here.  It is a tremendous follow-up to his earlier book, The Power of Now, which opened the door to spiritual enlightment and higher levels of consciousness.
B0000009SM|5.0|Whenever I consider an artist, I first of all take into account whether the individual is a genius or a god.  My criteria is based on the musical talent of the artist.  For example, a group like AC DC attains god status because, although very talented, anyone that can play an instrument decently can play their music, but only they can do it right.    Frank Zappa attained genius status, and One Size Fits All is such a genius composition that I give it 5 stars.  From the cover art to the music everything about this album is fantastic.  Frank Zappa's musical genius laces this cd.      Black gospel inspired Sofa No 1 is my favorite tune to listen to.  Po-jama People showcases genius  This cd and Apostrophy showcase the best of Frank Zappa
B000001FLA|2.0|Yngwie's third album is just abysmal in comparison to what he had produced before and just isn't worth buying in my opinion.    The music just becomes more formulaic in terms of technique and the lyrics are just cheesy.  'Queen is in Love'?  The song makes even Journey sound heavy.  'The Fury' is ok and so are the instrumentals but none measure up to what he had produced on his two previous albums.  'Magic Mirror' sounds like a song from a Disney cartoon.  Malmsteen just leaves no space for talent other than his own and he doesn't show much of it on this album.  DeSoto never wanted to be a metal singer and was looking for a gig as a power rock singer to the likes of Survivor: it sounds like it.  I had the unique opportunity of seeing Malmsteen perform while touring for this album.  Great soloist without question but having a band is just that: being a band and not just a soloist.  That's why Satriani, McAlpine, etc., never made it anywhere either.  I also saw Malmsteen perform as a stand in with Dio in Irvine and he sounded great.  He would have been a perfect replacement for Vivian Campbell.  It would have made for an interesting collaboration but I don't think the egos of either performer would have gotten along: too bad.    Ultimately, the main impediment to Yngwie's success was his overwhelming ego at wanting to be the whole band and trying to turn metal into classical.  And so, true to his Swedish pseudonym of 'Yngwie', he ended up remaining just that: just a 'little viking.'  In this album he's acutally a dwarf Viking.
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Bubl&eacute;'s self titled album truly shows off his excellent set of pipes! Michael has an excellent voice and it's great that he shares his gift with us. The sound quality on this CD is excellent; and I like the artwork, too.<br /><br />\\"Fever\\" is a number made so famous by the great Peggy Lee; and if she heard Michael sing this she'd be very pretty! Michael's rendition plays with the tempo and adds a few key changes to make this version of \\"Fever\\" all his own--excellent! The drums and percussion do a lot to carry the melody; I love it! \\"Moondance\\" is a great cover of a Van Morrison song; Michael sings this with energy and his enthusiasm is practically infectious! Michael sings this awesome love song with panache and he never misses a beat. Michael's talent really shows through here.<br /><br />Listen also for \\"Kissing A Fool;\\" Michael delivers this George Michael tune with all his heart and soul; the arrangement for the piano is so elegant. \\"Kissing A Fool\\" is a prime example of music for slow dancing with your sweetheart late at night all alone in your living room. \\"For Once In My Life\\" features Michael Bubl&eacute; performing a marvelous cover of this Stevie Wonder song; Michael slows down the tempo somewhat and the brass helps the musical arrangement along quite a bit. Michael performs \\"For Once In My Life\\" with true heartfelt passion and that's very special.<br /><br />\\"How Can You Mean A Broken Heart\\" has Michael singing a bit more near the top of his range; the Gibb brothers would love it! The elegant music that accompanies Michael as he sings this fits perfectly to make this number soar.<br /><br />\\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" is a cover of a great rock song by Queen; and when Bubl&eacute; sings this he makes it just as electric as Queen did--but in his own way. On \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love\\" Michael Bubl&eacute; keeps the original tempo of the rock song but his voice is so smooth it easily rivals that of Freddy Mercury and Queen's original version of this tune. \\"Put Your Head On My Shoulder\\" features Michael Bubl&eacute; squarely front and center--and he commands your attention so easily because of his natural vocal talents. Wow, how Bubl&eacute; can sing!<br /><br />\\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" is a classic love song that gets the royal treatment from Michael; listen for an elegant arrangement to enhance the natural beauty of this number. \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" is easily a major highlight of this album. Of course, \\"Come Fly With Me\\" is a marvelous cover of this tune Frank Sinatra loved to sing; and Michael does this great justice with his fine voice. The musical arrangement for \\"Come Fly With me\\" fits in perfectly with Michael's singing this song, too.<br /><br />The CD ends with Michael performing \\"That's All.\\" This tender love song shines like gold when Michael delivers this all the while sounding like pure silk. It's wonderful!<br /><br />Michael Bubl&eacute; fans will want this album in their collections. Other people just discovering the magic of Michael Bubl&eacute; can use this as a fine CD for starters.\\" features Michael Bublé squarely front and center--and he commands your attention so easily because of his natural vocal talents.

B00005QBER|5.0|Yet another solid hit by the Scorpions, pretty much the leading hard rock band along with Def Leppard to come out of the 70s and 80s (as opposed to metal proper such as Priest and Maiden). Just great classics on this album as well with brilliant musicianship and great lead guitar work by Mathias Jabbs: simply one of the most underrated lead guitarists from that period. Get out your lighters and raise your hands for another model hard rock band for more model power ballads with 'Always Somewhere', 'Is There Anybody There?', and 'Holiday.'  You can't go wrong with this album or any album by Scorpions except those following Love At First Sting which was their last good album.

B000RZGFYS|5.0|Tough call to rate which of Slayer's albums is best but, in terms of their earlier albums, this is probably Slayer's best with songs such as 'Angel of Death' and the delicious 'Piece by Piece.'  I like the remix version of 'Criminally Insane' better: it has a better introduction.  'Raining Blood' is a great one too. Slayer is a band you either love or hate.  Slayer has always been consistant in style and quality and if you like what's on this album you'll probably like everything else they've recorded except perhaps for 'Undisputed Attitude' which is mostly punk cover songs.  You can't go wrong with this album.  This is truly the ultimate mosh band. Enjoy!
0553381687|5.0|I have been a bit of a 'grazer' when it comes to fantasy.  I read it here and there, but I usually change up my reading between the large doorstoppers to read something else.  I had A GAME OF THRONES on my shelf since about 1998, but at the time I had already become cynical from wasted investments into Terry Goodkind and Robert Jordan.  It took me 10 years before I would finally invest in a fantasy series again that was still ongoing (as of my writing)*.<br /><br />Well, in hindsight, I should have read this book back then, and perhaps I would not have lost faith in so much of current Fantasy all this time.  Martin is a masterful storyteller, and he knows that interesting characters and drama are the benchmarks of ALL stories (Fantasy as a genre is let off the hook far too often, as if it has some kind of special excuse for cardboard cliche characters and derivative worlds cobbled from the last 5 books the author read).<br /><br />If you want the plot, read the synopsis.  All I will tell you is that this is mature, intelligent, ADULT fantasy.  If you prefer to remain lost in the fanboy worlds of so many other writers cranking out stories to appeal to your stunted junior high maturity level, by all means.  But if you would like to have your heart and intelligence stirred, and not just your escapist desire to live out your video game Avatar, pick this up. It ranks alongside the THOMAS COVENANT novels and any of Guy Gavriel Kay's works.<br /><br />*I haven't read the rest of the series as of this writing, so I can't say if it's all held together later. This is my stand alone review of Book 1.
B00005NNMJ|3.0|'Metal Heart' and this album brought this German hybrid of of Judas Priest and AC/DC into the spotlight.  I listened to this album a lot when it came out and I still like Accept but this is really not their best stuff. Like a lot of other metal from the mid-80s, it has just passed its expiration date.  Songs about putting your balls to the wall and plugging an explosive into everyone's rectum as a sign of victory isn't really that appealing. A sign of victory to what I wonder. London leatherboys?  Sounds like a gay S&M song just like many of Rob Halford's.  Udo Dirkschneider is a reasonably good singer to the likes of Brian Johnson and Wolf Hoffmann is a good lead guitarist which keeps Accept in the above average level of otherwise forgettable '80s bands like Armored Saint or Grim Reaper. Most of this album is pretty forgettable stuff. This is not the album you want to start with if you're going to listen to Accept though. I would choose 'Metal Heart' over 'Balls to the Wall' if you are considering between the two. 'Restless and Wild' and 'Breaker' are their best albums in my book: heavier and more original.
B000002MJ0|5.0|This is one of those albums than everybody ought to have in their possession.  MBV is THE shoegaze band, and this is their most all-out effort.  The songwriting here is impeccable, and the musical style is definitive of the \\"shoegaze\\" movement.  This is the album that everybody and anybody who considers their music shoegaze will be compared to.
B000001EUP|5.0|Solid hit by the Scorpions following 'Animal Magnetism' and 'Lovedrive.' This album is just great German hard rock from the 1980s from one of the best bands in that genre along with Def Leppard.  Every song on this album is just a classic hit thanks to brilliant musicianship and the outstanding lead guitar work by Mathias Jabbs: simply one of the most underrated lead guitarists from that period who is just as impressive as Randy Rhoads in his style.  Just listen to the rythm and lead on the title song!  'Dynamite' is another hit!  Great stuff! Also, don't forget to get out your lighters and raise your hands as Scorpions is the model hard rock band for your power ballad with the hit 'No One Like You.'  Just as creative and moving as the later hit 'Still Loving You.'  Again, Mathias Jabbs just delivers an excellent solo on this one.  You can't go wrong with this album or any album by Scorpions except those following Love At First Sting which was their last good album.
B0010YSD7M|1.0|Not the best thing to come out of the Stargate world, but not hideously awful(but close). Could have been an episode if they had taken out some of the pointless middle 'plotlines'. Made me miss Jack and I still don't like Carter's new hair. The best part was the behind the scene part where they show how they have a gel coating they can put on a stuntman and then light them on fire with a blow torch and not hurt them-at all. That is awesome-better then anything in this movie.
B000001C6M|5.0|Great first album by Slayer. A little more raw and not as polished as some of their later stuff but still Slayer at its best.  A band you either love or hate.  Slayer has always been true to their origins and if you like what's on this album you'll probably like everything else they've recorded except perhaps for 'Undisputed Attitude' which is mostly punk cover songs.  Slayer rules!
B000ZLFALI|5.0|Saw the movie in the theatre and had to get a copy for home.  Better watching it a second and third time.  The 2nd DVD offers so much about the movie ... the actors ... the director ... it was an entire day of entertainment.  If you love the Beatles, you have to get this movie.
B000001EUR|5.0|Last solid hit by the Scorpions in 1984 following three successes with 'Lovedrive', 'Animal Magnetism', and 'Blackout.'  This album is just solid German hard rock from the 1980s from one of the best bands in that genre along with Def Leppard.  Every song on this album is just a classic hit thanks to brilliant musicianship and the outstanding lead guitar work by Mathias Jabbs: simply one of the most underrated lead guitarists from that period who is just as impressive as Randy Rhoads in his style.   Also, don't forget to get out your lighters and raise your hands as Scorpions is pretty much the model hard rock band for your power ballad with the hit 'Still Loving You.'  Very well thought out lyrically and musically, again, Mathias Jabbs just delivers an excellent solo.  You can't go wrong with this album or any album by Scorpions preceding this album.  This album was really their last good album.
B0011U8NZ2|4.0|Overall good purchase. I have purchased all of the live releases from the Doors over the last several years.  They are all great but few stick out as unique or superior to the others.    I recommend buying Live in Detroit if you are only going to purchase one of the live releases.  It stands out as the best release to date.
B000065AU2|3.0|'Metal Heart' and 'Balls to the Wall' were the first hit albums that brought this German hybrid version of Judas Priest and AC/DC into the spotlight and this is the album that followed the two.  I listened to this album a lot when it came out and I still like Accept but this is really not their best stuff. Like a lot of other metal from the mid-80s, it has just passed its expiration date.     Udo Dirkschneider is a reasonably good singer to the likes of Brian Johnson and Wolf Hoffmann is a good lead guitarist which keeps Accept in the above average level of otherwise forgettable '80s bands like Armored Saint or Grim Reaper. The title track is pretty good along with 'Aiming High' and 'Heaven is Hell' but the rest is pretty forgettable.      This is not the album you want to start with if you're going to listen to Accept though. 'Balls to the Wall' and 'Metal Heart' are better albums but 'Restless and Wild' and 'Breaker' are their best albums in my book: heavier and more original.
0618918248|1.0|My favorite chapter was the one where Dawkins realizes that you can't have a big bang without a big Banger.  That no matter how old you choose to make the Universe, there still exists a moment before that time that requires explanation.  The matterial that produced the universe had to come from somewhere!  Perhaps the same God that created the universe also upholds it with natural physical scientific laws that are also a marvelous creation.  Perhaps it is limited thinking to reduce faith to \\"blind faith\\" rather than a confidence in the historical and scientific reality set before us.  Could it be that the same precision that holds subatomic particles together is also seen at a cellular level, an earthly level, and an intergalactic level. All of these defy simple chance.  If you walk out of your office today and see the latest model personal computer sitting in the parking lot.  It is safer to think that someone put it there or that it fell out of a car rather than thinking this evolved as a random or selected statistical event in nature.
B000001EUN|5.0|Another solid hit by the Scorpions!  Pretty much the leading hard rock band along with Def Leppard to come out of the 80s (as opposed to metal proper such as Priest and Maiden).  Although it doesn't carry as hard of an edge as 'Black Out' or even 'Love at First Sting', every song on this album is just a classic hit thanks to brilliant musicianship and the outstanding lead guitar work by Mathias Jabbs: simply one of the most underrated lead guitarists from that period who is just as impressive as Randy Rhoads in his style.  Don't forget to get out your lighters and raise your hands as Scorpions is the model hard rock band for your power ballad with the hit 'Lady Starlight' which is just as moving as the later 'No One Like You' and 'Still Loving You.'  You can't go wrong with this album or any album by Scorpions except those following Love At First Sting which was their last good album.
B000EJ9MTW|5.0|Rarely do you see every song on a CD being at least decent. However, I have found that every song on this album is good. Had only heard the most popular ones and decided to buy this album at a good price and it ended up being a good decision.
B00000263T|3.0|'Metal Heart' was the first hit that brought this German version of Judas Priest into the spotlight which was followed by the more popular 'Balls to the Wall.' I listened to this album a lot when it came out and I still like Accept but this is really not their best stuff. Like a lot of other metal from the mid-80s, it has just passed its expiration date.  That's what happens when you put the date 1999 in your song with lyrics like:     It is 1999  The human race is dyiiing    No, actually, it's 2008 now and the human race is alive and kicking: 8 billion strong and growing!  The only song with that date in its lyrics to have stood the test of time is, sadly enough, Prince's '1999.'    Udo Dirkschneider is a reasonably good singer to the likes of Brian Johnson and Wolf Hoffmann is a good lead guitarist which keeps Accept in the above average level of otherwise forgettable '80s bands like Armored Saint or Grim Reaper. Great transcription and adaptation of Beethoven's 'Fur Elise' as a solo on the title song. 'Midnight Mover' and 'Up To The Limit' are pretty good too. 'Too High To Get It Right' is another good one.  The rest is pretty forgettable stuff.  This is not the album you want to start with if you're going to listen to Accept though. I would choose this one over 'Balls to the Wall' if you are considering between the two.  'Restless and Wild' and 'Breaker' are their best albums in my book: heavier and more original.
B00005JLFC|4.0|As the first of only three films she has directed (so far), Barbra Streisand's 1983 labor of love still holds up as a charming turn-of-the-last-century fable that blends a contemporary sense of its three principal characters with an elaborately orchestrated soundtrack. The movie plays out very much like the way she uniquely sings a song - beautifully lush, emotionally intimate and a bit overdone albeit forgivably so. Regardless, what makes this film genuinely successful is the heartfelt manner in which Streisand chooses to tell her version of Isaac Bashevis Singer's short story, [[ASIN:0374293481 Yentl the Yeshiva Boy]]. Co-written by her and English playwright Jack Rosenthal, the plot focuses on a young Jewish woman in Eastern Europe who has been tutored on the Talmud by her scholarly father. Since women are forbidden to receive a formal education, it remains a clandestine vocation until her father dies at which point she cuts off her hair, dresses like a boy, and seeks passage to the nearest Talmudic academy.<br /><br />En route, under the guise of Anshel, she meets Avigdor with whom she falls in love. Complications ensue since Yentl cannot reveal her true identity to Avigdor, who is in love with the comely Hadass, but Hadass becomes attracted to Anshel through the machinations of Avigdor when he is forbidden by Hadass' father to marry her. Streisand directs this romantic roundelay with warmth and sincerity rather than cheap laughs, and naturally, as a means to bridge her dramatic interpretations of the big ballads penned by Michel Legrand and her favorite lyricists, Alan & Marilyn Bergman. The songs reflect interior monologues to express how Yentl feels in any given situation, and the conjoining technique works beautifully since the songs are so well crafted and Streisand is in glorious, emotionally unfettered voice. The best are the solitarily prayerful \\"Papa, Can You Hear Me?\\" under a starry night sky, the lusciously unrequited passion driving \\"The Way He Makes Me Feel\\", and the triumphant declaration of \\"No Matter What Happens\\".<br /><br />As expected from as meticulous a novice filmmaker as Streisand, the production values are superior, especially David Watkin's burnished cinematography and Roy Walker's production design. In truth, Streisand looks too old as Yentl the yearning woman, but in full drag as Anshel, she looks ideally boyish. As she traverses genders back and forth with a fumbling grace, it is probably the most subtle acting she has done in films. Mandy Patinkin, then more famous as a singing Ch&eacute; Guevara in [[ASIN:B000002ORP Evita]], makes for a potent romantic lead bringing a surly intellect and smoldering passion to Avigdor. As the third corner in the triangle, Amy Irving convincingly plays the subservient bride-to-be with sly intelligence. Veteran character actor Nehemiah Persoff ([[ASIN:B000FIHNAC Some Like It Hot]]) makes his few poignant scenes count as Yentl's father. A bit overlong at 132 minutes, it isn't a perfect film but it remains an impressive directorial debut and the first film that validates Streisand's exalted standing as a multi-hyphenate entertainment figure.\\", and the triumphant declaration of \\"No Matter What Happens\\".

B0000TB01Y|5.0|I didn't much care for the stage show because having been in many shows I could not remember one song to sing after leaving the theater.

B000OZ28IS|5.0|William Boyd's latest novel, \\"Restless,\\" is an exceptional and wholly brilliant literary work on the theme of deception. It is also a compelling thriller, an intricate spy novel, and a fascinating work of historical fiction that uncovers little-known and embarrassing realities about the true relationship between Great Britain and the United States in the years immediately preceding the latter's entry into World War II. Don't pick up this book if you are looking for a genre-type spy novel. This is definitely not that type of book. This is an historically based literary novel concerning British espionage against the United States in three years leading up to Pearl Harbor.  If that appeals to you, you won't be disappointed. This book gets my highest recommendation, and is certainly one of the best books I've read all year.<br /><br />The story concerns two women, Sally Gilmartin, a seemingly ordinary aging British widow, and her daughter Ruth, a twenty-eight-year-old single mother. Ruth has a flat in Oxford and her mother lives in a cottage not too far away in the outlying rural district of Oxfordshire. Ruth is an Oxford graduate student trying to finish her Ph.D. thesis while earning a living teaching English to foreigners. As the novel opens, Ruth is worried about her mother: she seems constantly restless and is showing increasing signs of paranoia. Eventually, the mother divulges the reason for her persistent state of unease: she suspects that someone is out to kill her. In explanation, the mother gives the daughter the first chapter of a biography entitled \\"The Story of Eva Delectorskaya,\\" then she shocks her daughter even more by admitting that the story is, in fact, her own autobiography. Sally Gilmartin was the British spy Eva Delectorskaya, and she's been on the run and in hiding for the past 35 years. Now she fears that someone has found her out and plans to kill her.<br /><br />For the rest of the novel, the chapters alternate between Sally's story of her life as a British spy from 1939 to 1942, and the ongoing story of Ruth during the unusually hot British summer of 1976. Sally doles out the chapters of her life as a spy in bits and pieces over the course of a few months. While Ruth fearfully waits for each new installment of her mother's harrowing tale, she not only has a hard time coming to grips with the reality of her mother's past, but also lives through her own summer of shady happenings. Unintentionally, Ruth becomes involved with political activists and starts to experience her own restlessness and paranoia--deceptions build upon deceptions.<br /><br />Eventually, the two stories come together in an exciting and totally unpredictable denouement. The ending is exceptionally clever! You'll be thinking about the twists and turns of this ending long after you've finished the last page. In particular, you'll be thinking about the nature of deception...even deception between mother and daughter.<br /><br />Throughout the novel, Boyd's message is clear: deception is dehumanizing, and if the business of spies is deception, then the price they pay is to live in a world without trust. \\"Restless\\" won the 2006 Costa Novel Award, one of the most prestigious literary prizes in the United Kingdom, recognizing the best novel of the year by writers based in the UK and Ireland.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|I have enjoyed Stargate SG-1 since it started.  The only disappointment I had in the movie was that Jack O'Neil (Richard Dean Anderson) was not in it.  I like Ben Browder, but no one can hold a candle to Anderson.  That is my only complaint.  I thought the movie was well done, moving right along as far as the action went. I hope there is another movie in the offing and that RDA will be in the cast!
B0010ZR160|4.0|Ben Affleck proves himself as a director with his perfect casting, choice of scene location, and ability to stay true to the storyline of the book.  Take it from a rabid Dennis Lehane fan - Casey Affleck and Michelle Monaghan ARE Patick Kenzie AND Angie Gennaro sprung from Lehanes book onto the movie screen. Can't wait until they team up again to do another Lehane book to movie make (like \\"A Drink Before THe War\\" - Lehanes first and probably most violent book - makes Gone Baby Gone and Mysic River look like boy scout stuff)
B0013D8LOU|3.0|Spoiler-free impressions:    It's hard to judge this one as a film, having recently seen John's Doyle's award-winning production on Broadway, featuring a stripped-down cast and minimalist set design. Tim Burton's film, by contrast, is positively (perhaps needlessly?) maximalist: the grime is grimiest, the blood is bloodiest, the squalor is, um, squalidest. It's pretty much exactly what you'd expert Tim Burton to do with Sweeney Todd: cast Johnny Depp in the lead (as usual), alongside his muse/girlfriend Helena Bonham-Carter (as usual), Alan Rickman as the dour British guy (his usual role), Timothy Spall as the smarmy British sycophant (having, in 2007 alone, tackled that role in Harry Potter 5 and again as Fagin in a BBC adaptation of Oliver Twist)... and then slap the usual coat of Tim Burton patina (squiggly black curlicue hair, desaturated tones) over the source material, adding little and illuminating less.     What strengths exist in the film-- and there are many-- are doubly strong, however, on Broadway: the counterpoint and consummate Britishness of the songs, the suspense of the murders, and ultimately the themes (primarily the central counterpoint of protagonist and villain, the barber versus the judge, the lowly versus the powerful). Depp does his best Bowie impression on the musical numbers and the cast sings surprisingly well (perhaps with the aid of digital correction?), but there's no remotely essential, let alone breakthrough, performance...    A decent film with some flashes of inspiration in the imagery, but overall a perfunctory and forgettable adaptation.

0143036556|4.0|Jared Diamond is my hero, one of a small group of writers who've drastically impacted the way I view the world. And this book *feels* important and like something I should want to read ... but I'm struggling. I read a chapter, then put it down in favor or something else. Still working through it. I don't mean to say it's tedious, just not quite as engaging and thought-provoking as I found Diamond's other works to be. I loved The Third Chimpanzee, and Guns, Germs, and Steel is one of the most important books ever written. So buy this, own it, reference it, but don't expect to be wowed by it.

141694740X|5.0|This book is a staple when trying to figure out if he's 'The One' or if 'The One' has just walked out the door and all over your heart (Hint: he isn't).  No matter how badly I feel when a relationship ends, Greg puts it all in perspective for me. Yes, I cry, bargain, deny - I experience all those stages.  Then I read Greg's words, and realize that if ______ (insert latest breakup's name here) really wanted to be around, he would be.  By the end of the book, you won't want to 'waste the pretty' on another guy who is so NOT worth your precious time.
0471267554|5.0|The Paleo Diet took me awhile to actually digest. I read it, set it aside, and then came back to it. There are many similar approaches to explaining how we should eat, but The Paleo Diet gets to the core of who we are and why we should be \\"eating Paleo.\\" Being human, I have deviated from \\"eating Paleo\\" repeatedly, and I can redeem myself in just a couple of days by refocusing on the principles of the diet. The very term, \\"diet,\\" creates a problem because it suggests something temporary, something to do for awhile to set oneself aright. That's why I have adopted the term \\"eating Paleo,\\" which is what I endeavor to do for optimal health.<br /><br />The Paleo Diet is simply essential for everyone who wishes to appropriately nourish through the most appropriate nutrition. Some, who may have problems that had not seemed related to diet, may go through an \\"Aha\\" experience as they read through the pages. Eating Paleo is not just for the overweight. It is for everyone seeking optimal health.

1594200823|5.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma should be required reading for every single American, period. American culture, especially, has developed an assembly line, industrial, one-size-fits-all approach that serves corporate culture and the bottom line. The result has been catastrophic for Americans at the dinner table. If this sounds extreme, then you haven't read the book. Since reading the book, and being the principal cook in my family, I will not serve feedlot beef, period, since it always comes from livestock that are, to some extent, sick. That's why feedlot steers are given antibiotics that pasture fed steers don't require.<br /><br />The Omnivore's Dilemma is in no way a dry, technical or statistics-based book. It is written in a light, entertaining and witty style while presenting a detailed narrative of the various experiences of the author. He prepares for a series of meals, the first of which is at McDonald's, following a thorough investigation of the progress of a young calf, which he purchased, from the pasture to the feedlot and finally to becoming the contents of a golden arches burger. Then he goes in pursuit of truly awesome nutrition, taking the reader to Polyface Farm where \\"the animals do all the work\\" (well, almost), and consumers drive considerable distances to purchase the beef, chickens, swine, turkeys and eggs from the farm. Once you have explored the Polyface Farm philosophy, you may find yourself asking, repeatedly, \\"Why aren't all Americans demanding that we raise food in this way?\\"<br /><br />The Omnivore's Dilemma is simply essential. If you haven't read it, you are way, way out of the loop.

0061373877|5.0|If you like Neil Gaiman stories read to you, this is (again) a wonderful listen.  I prefer Neil to read to me, and thus this is a wonderful set of discs.  If you have not had Neil read to you, then you are in for a treat.  Many consider this Neil's best novel, I am not sure I would say it is his best, but I do so love it and the TV series it started out as was fun, but this is a great piece of fiction that most anyone should love  It is at heart a romantic adventure story, but it much much more than that as are all of Neil's works.  It is fun and serious, dark and up lifting and has  many a sharp point to make while not beating you in the head with them, or treating you like you are stupid.  You many feel a twing once you realize them, or just have a smile cross your face, but you will feel good when done no matter  your point of view compared to Mr. Gaiman's.
0385337388|5.0|I was somewhat apprehensive when my uncle, a surgeon, suggested I read this indicating, that, in fact, this is what life is like for a medical intern. From the first page forward, I couldn't put it down. Samuel Shem's caustic, witty, and throughly penetrating writing style had me in stiches for most every day during that week over the summer that I read this. As he described the main character's time in the cardiac ward with the cardiologist who \\"ran for fitness, fished for calm\\" I thought back to all the cardiologists I knew and said \\"THAT's It!\\" they ARE all like this. This eerie must- have- gone -through -this -to -write -with -this- kind- of -realism pervades the book. Everything has the taste of authenticity. The reader laughs about \\"buffing and turfing\\" patents to other wards, and \\"being a wall\\" in the ER as opposed to the most despicable \\"seive.\\"     In short, I loved this book. A truly masterful attempt at capturing the hellacious world of the medical intern and the transformation from college student with only theoretical textbook information to doctor with real world experience.

I would have loved to see how Vala got the keys to open the cells but that all was cut out.  The cuts were obvious through out the film.  I would have rather seen the film for 120 to 150 minutes then see it so leap froggy.  Don't do it again to the next film!!!<br /><br />P.S. I loved the cinematography, the actors, the humor, the plot and Stargate,SG-1!  I just couldn't stay focused when I had questions about how, when, or where.  I'm glad I have the DVD to see it more than once and quess what was in the cuts.  Can I have the uncut version, please?
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I grew up watching Hollywood musicals and I have to say this is one of my all time favorites (sorry Mary Poppins will always hold top spot :) ).     The actors were perfectly casted. I believed they were who they portrayed and was captivated from the opening scene. I felt sorry for Mr. Todd, hatred for the Judge and wanted to comfort innocent Toby. Tim Burton created a beautiful film, his shots were gorgeous. I loved the color choices...the dull grays and the lipstick red blood really brought out a fairy-tale quality to the film...stunning! This film wasn't gory by any means. I don't like horror films and was never scared watching this film. The blood scenes are so over-the-top that you aren't disgusted, but reminds one this is a film.     As for the singing, all the folks talking about the fact the actors (some) were not professional singers- bah-humbug! Old-school Hollywood musicals were fun and over-the-top. Sometimes they had professional singers and sometimes they didn't, I don't think it mattered. One watches musicals for entertainment, if I wanted to hear music I would go to a concert. I believe the actors \\"common\\" voices is what made the film even better...it added realness to the characters.      I have never seen this musical on a stage so if 50% of the original score is missing, I didn't notice.

B000UYX4OK|1.0|This is a horrible movie. Anyone looking for something similar to Lord of the Rings or any other well-done movie based on an epic tale, should look elsewhere. Terrible script, bad sets, horrible acting. I could watch/listen when Selma the witch with the American accent was on screen. Her acting is some of the worst I've seen in recent times. How does she get work? And the script writer went out of his way to make the dialogue sound epic or \\"old\\" and it sounded ridiculous with her American accent. Not to mention all the gratuituous swearing. Swearing's fine (I do a lot of it myself) but when it's just crammed in there for no reason it's sound moronic. Bad movie. Laughable makeup jobs (check out Grendel's hair and muscle suit).

Doesn't even solve European problems--class warfare, high unemployment, mediocre education, mediocre health care.  These solutions will however take your money, make it impossible for you to buy anything good privately, and create a solid class of dependent voters for Obama.    Do you really think that he will cut taxes on 95%, increase them only on 5%, and pay for everything!  We better have an awful lot more rich people reporting their income every year!

B000068QVN|3.0|GREAT TO HEAR EARLY 1970'S POWER TRIO MUSIC  But, there are some problems with this CD and the group's performance.  The older, rawer The Live Album is a much better experience.    As the name states, this CD contains songs taken from various concerts during the 1971 tour to support the album Closer to Home.  It was an enormous commercial success, selling out big arenas.  The CD is about 78 minutes long.    The sound quality is pretty good and the crowd noise is appropriate.  The sound quality is better than many live CD's from recent concerts, like anything by Dave Matthews.  I do think that the bass and drums are mixed too far up front, even for Grand Funk.    By 1971, the group is getting too slick (if you can believe it), and this performance does not have the raw power that the group had at the very beginning of its career.  There are some great driving moments, but there are some plodding ones.     When I was a yound teeny-bopper, The Live Album came out about the same time as Closer to Home.  At the time, I was so disappointed that some of the group's latest hits, especially I'm Your Captain/Closer to Home was ot on it.  Now that I hear these live versions of those songs, I am disappointed.  They are actually better and have more power on the studio album.    This CD starts out with a recording of Also Sprach Zarathustra (also known as the theme to 2001).  This is the was the intro to each concert as the band came out on stage and some idiot announcer introduced the band.  This kind of stunt was more appropriate for an artsy, pretentious, progressive rock band like Yes.    The group does get right into with some booming bass guitar in Are You Ready (the perfect first song for a concert) and the groups moves into a nice Foot Stompin' Music.  From there, it all goes downhill.    Grand Funk was one of many groups that relied on heavy drums and bass.  Later I discovered why...groups like Grand Funk, Black Sabbath and even The Who did not have a guitar player strong enough to carry the band (Pete Townsend has even admitted that).  Farner even plays keyboards half of the time, and that is probably where he is most effective.  He does get in some nice guitar lines now and then, but much is cliched.    Included is a 15 minute drum solo contained within the 17 minute TNUC.  If you were the type who went to concerts stoned, loved to sit in the cheap seats, stand up during the drum solo and play air drums, before puking on the people in front of you, this is a perfect track.  This drum solo contains nearly every drum solo cliche you could imagine (short of the drummer blowing up at the end).    The second to last song is a really bad version of Gimme Shelter.  There are 2 things wrong with this track:    1.  The performance is not very good and does not highlight the bands strengths.    2.  At the end of the song is a long interlude where the announcer talks to the audience about the band coming back for an encore, and trying to get the guitar peddle back that someone stole.  It is a lot of crap that I didn't even care to hear once.  What makes its inclusion so bad is this CD is not even a full concert recording.  It comes from many concerts.  The song that follows on this CD is not even the encore from that concert, but a song from another concert.    There is just too much junk on this CD.  It you want to hear raw, tasteless, heart pounding, bass driven, power trio music, get The Live Album instead.
B0002858YS|5.0|This is a great album - it contains some radio friendly tunes, but stays true to the bands artistic vision.  Well produced, great song writing - a rare talented group in a dismal modern pop environment.  I typically listen to classic rock, but every once in a while a band comes along that demands your attention - The Killers are certainly that...    Check out the track \\"All The Things That I Have Done\\" - one of the best songs I have heard in the last few years.
B00000G42T|3.0|After listening to this compilation in full, I was really disappointed with the overall song selection.  Perhaps George Michael (or the record company) felt that these were his best songs (and many of them are certainly good, even the lesser-known ones), but the majority of them are definitely not the tunes that made him a household name.<br /><br />I've always had respect for Michael as I knew even as a kid in the 1980s that he was the creative force behind WHAM! and he remained in control of his music into his solo career with writing and producing (which I will forever admire, given how much record company executives want to keep pop musicians under their creative thumb).<br /><br />Many of the songs included here are very jazzy and there are too many covers for someone of Michael's creative caliber to have done and then used here.  He had many pop hits as a member of WHAM! and especially in his solo career, so why all the filler material?<br /><br />I will join the chorus here and say I was majorly disappointed that the lesser-known version of \\"I Want Your Sex\\" (Part II) was chosen to be included over the better version that the general public came to know and love.<br /><br />Whenever I buy a CD or, believe it or not, a tape or record (anyone remember them???) from an artist that was a big part of my pop music introduction in the 1980s, I always get those \\"Whoa! I haven't heard this in a *long* time\\" moments.  There were two instances of that here, with \\"Monkey\\" (I can't remember the last time I heard that one on corporate radio) and his duet with Aretha Franklin, \\"I Knew You Were Waiting (For Me)\\" (ditto).<br /><br />I just think Michael (and/or the record company) should have cut out what I consider to be the filler songs and just kept it to one CD/one tape, putting all his well-known pop hits here and keeping the lesser-known songs to a minimum.  I know that sounds like a corporate pop music mindset in and of itself, but the lesser-known songs here really detracted from the compliation's intent (although I still have great respect and admiration for Michael as a pop musician).  - Donna Di Giacomo(although I still have great respect and admiration for Michael as a pop musician).  - Donna Di Giacomo

B00005JPTK|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters and then purchased the DVD.  It is quite an impressive work.  Fans of Matheson's original book will definitely enjoy the haunting depiction of New York City following the disappearance of humans altogether.  The first part of the plot is very intense and, at times, can be downright scary, even when the \\"dark seekers\\" are not present.    Many people have stated that they did not like the ending, something to which I must agree.  The film loses its momentum towards the end.  I bought the 2-disc version just to get the alternate ending in case something \\"better\\" was available, but did not think the alternative was much better.  All-in-all, the writers could have done a much better job in incorporating the final sequences to the middle of the story.  But, that can be hard at times when the writers don't get to interact with the directors.    Despite that, I still think it is a worthy film to watch.  I would much rather be writing a review for a decent film like this than some pointless, shoot-em-up Michael Bay flick.  Most people will likely enjoy \\"I Am Legend\\", the first part at the very least.

B0010X745K|5.0|Some people think scary movies require some serial killer or ridiculous swamp monster.  For those people, \\"The Mist\\" will likely not be enjoyed.  For others looking for a more developed horror storyline, they may find it enjoyable.    It is the story of a father and son trapped in a grocery store after a mysterious mist settles over the town.  Hidden in this mist are creatures that kill anybody daring to venture from the safety of the building.  However, as the world outside grows more frightening, a crazy religious woman starts to mislead a few people into thinking the way to solve their problem is through sacrifice.  So, on one hand, this movie is a horror movie because of the monsters.  On the other hand, it is a horror movie because the \\"good guys\\" are up against a mob of frightened, mislead town residents that used to be friends and neighbors.    All in all, I liked this movie, as I found it to be psychologically intimidating.  It is not particularly gory, although there are a few bloody scenes from creatures attacking people.  The religious woman got to be a little over the top at the beginning, but she became really scary towards the end and fit really well with the story.  Lots of elements from the novella can be found in this movie, so readers of King may enjoy it.  The ending is different and, although many people say it was dumb and unrealistic, it was the only decent way the story could have ended different from the book and still have the same impact as the remainder of the story.    I give this film 5 stars.  I really like it and think others would too.  My only grievance is that the religious woman was a little annoying at the beginning.

Female killer robot from the future, chick with mechanic implants, and mutant crazy chick?  All the same.    However, somehow Sarah Conner Chronicles is just better with better plots and stories and... well everything.  (Dr. Burke left Christina to join a secret agency? Give me a break!!!)

1416550518|2.0|I actually received this book as an advanced copy for reviewing and just could not bring myself to read it, no matter how hard I tried. I finally got through it and it was a very painful process.    The book was reminiscent of Barbara Taylor Bradford's \\"A Woman of Substance\\", but not in a good way. It was as if Ms. Morton was trying to channel Bradford but did little more than make a poor copy of a great original.    The book had so much potential, but it fell flat, in my opinion. You could see the ending from a mile away. There wasn't much suspense in the plot and some major \\"revelations\\" were given so little attention after hinting at it throughout the book, almost as if an afterthought.    By the end of the book, I found myself skipping entire pages because I was so bored with the book and just wanted it to be over with.    Overall, I found the book poorly organized and not very original.

1594200823|2.0|The Omnivore's Dilemma:  Lunch for Lefties<br /><br />This book about the food industry could be used as a litmus test for politics.  If you're secular, gourmet, elitist, fond of big government and organized labor, opposed to capitalism and free trade, disdainful of new technology, naïve about how food is produced nowadays, and enamored of Europe as a model for America, you'll think this book is great.  Your biases match those of the author.<br /><br />If you are grateful for the ample, affordable, immensely varied food supply you find in America, and realize it comes to you from hard-working hands employed in for-profit businesses, operating in a free market economy, with help from technology and God, this book will make you angry.  If you are informed about agriculture, if you are politically conservative or libertarian, you'll absolutely hate this book.<br /><br />Unfortunately, The Omnivore's Dilemma is a bestseller.  It was first published in 2006 and reprinted as a paperback in 2007, so there are thousands of copies in the hands of readers, giving them a feast of misinformation designed to warp their views.<br /><br />I understand why this book sold well.  The author does a good job of weaving together facts and personal experiences into an entertaining, occasionally humorous narrative.  The style and anecdotal structure remind me of fellow pop nonfiction writer Bill Bryson (author of A Walk in the Woods:  Rediscovering America on the Appalachian Trail and other delights).  I prefer Bryson because he has no political axe to grind, and Pollan clearly does.  He teaches journalism at the University of California at Berkeley and writes for The New York Times Magazine, making him a card-carrying member of the left-wing media elite, dedicated to organizing all facts to serve the cause.<br /><br />On the surface, this book is about food production in America.  The author surveys the entire spectrum of food sources, from the most industrial to the most primitive.  Heprovides eye-witness accounts of visits to a large corn farm in Iowa, a feedlot in Kansas, two large organic production facilities in California, and a small organic farm in Virginia.  He also reports experiences boar hunting and mushroom gathering.  The book culminates in a meal he prepares for friends, using all foraged ingredients.  All well and good.<br /><br />The problem I have with the book is that it pretends to be about food, but it's really about food politics.  Leftist propaganda intrudes like a nasty additive in an otherwise tasty dish.  The book is a polemic in the vein of Roger Moore's and Al Gore's movies.  Pollan presents best-case examples of food production he admires, and worst-case examples of production that doesn't jive with his ideology:  His description of the sustainable organic farm in Virginia makes it seem idyllic and his descriptions of the corn farm and feedlot make them seem awful.  It's argument by anecdote.<br /><br />The most offensive part of the book is the section on corn, America's largest crop and a major export, the primary feed grain for livestock and poultry, also used to make ethanol fuel.  From the mainstream point of view, hybrid corn is a godsend, part of the `green revolution' of higher-yielding grains that has enabled the world to continue to feed itself despite enormous population growth.  Without hybrid corn, wheat, and rice, many more people would go hungry.<br /><br />Pollan disparages corn as the \\"protocapitalist grain\\" and doesn't have much positive to say about it.  He describes a visit to a part of Iowa where farmers have abandoned the eco-friendly tradition of rotating crops between grain and legumes such as soybeans and now grow nothing but corn, even though overall corn production exceeds demand and prices sometimes fail to cover the cost of production.  (The book was published before the 2007 expansion of the federal subsidy for corn ethanol and subsequent price increase.)  The author blames corn mono-cropping for soil erosion, overuse of pesticides and herbicides, and pollution of ground and runoff water from overuse of nitrogen fertilizer (in place of nitrogen supplied naturally by legumes).  Because corn is also the source of high fructose corn syrup (HFCS) used in junk food, Pollan blames it for America's epidemic of obesity and Type II diabetes.<br /><br />Facts that don't support the author's negative views are missing.  He dwells on corn monocropping but fails to point out that most farmers still practice crop rotation; U.S. farmers will grow several billion bushels of soybeans in 2008; alfalfa is also widely cultivated.  He criticizes genetically modified hybrid seed but ignores recent breakthroughs in plant genetics, such as corn hybrids resistant to the root borer, eliminating the need for pesticides.  He also fails to mention the ultimate goal of plant breeders, expected within a few years:  grain hybrids that `fix' nitrogen so no fertilizer will be needed.  He criticizes corn farmers for depending on imported oil for fuel but fails to mention homegrown wind or methane alternatives.  He disparages meat and dairy products from corn-fed `factory farms' but deemphasizes the growing market share of soy alternatives  He disparages MacDonald's for selling corn-fed meat and soda full of HCFS, but doesn't tell us how much healthy bottled water and salads they sell....<br /><br />Pollan's anecdotal sources speak for him, spewing left-of-mainstream views.  He portrays his spokesmen in a sympathetic light, so when they serve as his political mouthpiece, the reader is tempted to adopt their views, even when there are no statistics or coherent arguments to back them up.  For example, he quotes an Iowa farmer who cynically says he grows corn for \\"the military-industrial complex\\" and declares, \\"The free market has never worked in agriculture and it never will.\\"  The farmer disparages the `cheap food' legislation enacted during the Nixon era, and recommends a return to theprevious policy.  The farmer is president of the National Family Farm Coalition, which according to its website, represents farmers who are against free trade, against big business, against GMO foods, and in favor of more government involvement--views not at all representative of mainstream Iowa farmers.  And Pollan only interviews that one farmer.  He doesn't interview any economist or recognized farm policy expert.<br /><br />Later in the book, Pollan steps out from behind his source-puppets to reveal his own views:  \\"A tension has always existed between the capitalist imperative to maximize efficiency at any cost and the moral imperatives of culture, which historically have served as a counterweight to the moral blindness of the market.  This is another example of the cultural contradictions of capitalism--the tendency over time for the economic impulse to erode the moral underpinnings of society.  Mercy toward the animals in our case is one such casualty.\\"  (p. 318)  Gawd.<br /><br />Despite the consistent ultra-leftward lean, Pollan never admits that his or his subjects' views are not mainstream.  It's obvious he hopes readers will be naïve enough to fall for his arguments and adopt similar views.  He's evangelizing.<br /><br />Pollan indulges in a `golden age phallacy' of nostalgia for the pre-Nixon years when farms were smaller, crop rotation was more widely practiced and fewer chemicals were used.  If we believe his Iowa source's views coincide with his own, he recommends a return to the federal subsidy system of those years.  What he fails to point out is, that program was a failure.  It took grain off the market to prevent oversupply and limited soil erosion through the acreage set-aside, but its low support price and bulging reserve kept prices low.  Per capita farm income in the 1960's remained insufficient, and the numbers of farmers began to decline as the younger generation left the farm for better-paying careers.  Small farmers and livestock operators began to go out of business because they couldn't compete with larger farms operating with better economy of scale and lower cost of production.  Thus, the industrialization of agriculture began in the 1960's.  Why should we go back to the policies and practices of that era?  Can we go back?  No, of course not.  The world has billions more people than it did fifty years ago.  We can't possibly feed them all without the hybrid seed, chemical fertilizer, herbicides, pesticides, industrial-sized farms, and other technology that Pollan disparages.  Technology dependency is the real `omnivore's dilemma'.<br /><br />Pollan's insistence on federal control of agriculture betrays totalitarianism.  He leads us to think grain farmers need a `nanny state' government to tell them how to farm.  Why?  Government subsidies are a cause of the corn surplus, not a solution to the problem.  Why should grain farming be regulated more than other industries?  Does the government tell fruit growers how many apples to produce?  No.  Does it tell manufacturers how many cars or shoes to produce?  No.  Does the government set prices for any of those items?  No.  In those industries, the free market determines prices and encourages supply to meet demand.  But Pollan, speaking through his Iowa farmer-puppet, has no faith in the free market.  Apparently, he wants the government to determine what crops and how much of each farmers grow, and how much they are paid:  in essence, central planning.  Perhaps he should visit North Korea and see what people there are having for lunch.<br /><br />The only time the author entertains the idea of less government regulation of food production is when he quotes the organic farmer in Virginia, who resents government inspection of his poultry slaughtering operation.  Since meat inspection is one area of the food industry where people of all political stripes see the need for government oversight, quoting this man does not support the idea of the `free market'farmer.<br /><br />Throughout, Pollan insists `smaller is better' in terms of farms and other businesses but never fully explains why this should be so.  He visits an organic produce farm in California and, although his description of its quality control and efficiency impressed me, he disparages the operation for being too large and factory-like, and for using nonunion labor.  He quotes a big organic farmer \\"that unless organic `scales up (it will) never be anything more than yuppie food\\" but dismisses large organic as just another form of factory farming.  He expresses admiration for the smaller, less mechanized but heavily subsidized farms of Europe.  Does he not realize that the EU can afford its farm subsidies only because it imports cheap US-subidized grain to feed its livestock and enjoys US subsidy of its defense through NATO?<br /><br />Another misleading part of the book discusses confinement lifestock farming.  Pollan claims that raising cattle, hogs, or chickens inside a building is cruel.  Does he not realize that the alternative is for them to be outdoors in the cold, wind, rain, and hot sun?  How is it `cruel' for animals to live in a heated and cooled, relatively clean concrete building?<br /><br />Pollan is a meat-eater; vegetarian alternatives get short treatment here, although the author does admit that if no one ate meat, a lot of the problems he describes would not be problems.  He expresses concern about the quality of life and death of livestock and game animals.  The mainstream position on animals as food is:  God created animals to serve man.  Man should treat them humanely, kill them with as little suffering as possible, and before enjoying their meat, give thanks for the bounty God has provided.  Pretty much any Christian, Jew, Moslem, or Buddhist and some Hindus would accept this view or a slight variation.  But not Pollan.  He devotes many words to the morality of meat eating, describing in nauseating detail a visit to a slaughterhouse,and discussing at length his feelings about killing a chicken and (in the chapter on hunting) a wild boar.  He references not only PETA but the Spanish philosopher Ortega y Gasset on the question, `Can animals experience happiness?'  Pollan tries to sound high-minded but comes off as squeamishly metrosexual and self-absorbed to the point of narcissism:  he's not writing about livestock so much as about his feelings.  At the banquet that culminates his research, he can't bring himself to say grace because he's \\"afraid it would come off sounding corny and might ruin some appetites.\\"  Should you buy ideas from this man?<br /><br />Given the weakness of Pollan's arguments, you wouldn't think his book would change minds about food policy, but apparently, it does.  I read it for a book club at a public library.  A dozen or so white Anglo urbanites showed up.  Most said they were \\"disturbed\\" by the feedlot and slaughter descriptions but agreed Pollan is a \\"great\\" writer.  No one but me was bothered by the paucity of facts to support the anecdotes, or the socialistic rhetoric.  In an hour's discussion, talk started out on a positive note about where to get organic food, but then, under the spell of Pollan's rhetoric, wandered into topics like food contamination, malnutrition, water pollution, corporate greed and the dangers of globalization.  Comments grew increasingly political and dark, until one woman, a nurse,  said, `The world has too many people'.  Another reader said, echoing the author's sentiments, \\"Farmers just want to make a profit...Capitalism ruins everything.\\"  Heads nodded.  There were murmurs of agreement.  I got up and left.<br /><br />One of the good parts of the book discusses composting.  I have a compost pile.  It will make a good home for this book.

B0011ZNAIC|2.0|Though the movie intended to be funny, it was pretty shallow. The starring bee of the movie, Barry Benson, finds that he is in love with a human, more specifically, a woman. It became awkward when it became clear that the woman had equal feelings for Barry too. Though the protagonist of the story took action of what he thought was right for himself and the community, he placed the whole bee community and human society down the drain. It was good that he took responsibility of his actions, but it wasn't quite what I expected it to be. Many scenes produced rude remarks and there was a scene about a grandma that was clearly NOT funny. Besides that, the ending of the story seemed rushed and without character. The makers of the film tried too hard to be funny and to create a \\"fantastic movie with morals\\", but it lacked both. It was a very disappointing movie, and I felt I could've done a better job at directing the movie myself.

B000JVT1U0|4.0|I don't know... I liked watching this movie, but did not fall in love with it, as it appears I should have done based on the majority of other reviews, here.    A couple of items in The Wicker Man left me cold. In the first place, I found myself roughly sympathetic to the \\"pagan\\" islanders throughout the film. Not knowing ahead of time what the conclusion would be, I kept hoping that the police officer would ultimately come to realize that they hadn't done anything wrong at all (nor were planning to) -- that he would be shown to be rude, blustery, and offensive for having barged his way into their lives, and tried to force upon them his own morality. That the \\"Christian soldier\\" would realize that there are potentially good things to be learned from those outside of his own faith. But no, it turns out he was essentially right all along, and just didn't have the man power to shut down what should have been shut down. The pagans turn out to be as wicked as he'd thought they were. That was disappointing.    In the second place, I didn't like how, in the end, the police officer becomes such a vociferous advocate of his faith... it seems to make the film a conflict between Christian and Pagan beliefs, with Christianity (naturally) riding with the morally-pure hero. But the truth is that the majority of the film really has nothing to do with either accepting or rejecting Jesus Christ -- the plot could just as easily have been a Christian group being invaded by a Pagan authority. The islanders weren't villainous because they didn't believe in Christ... they were villainous because they wanted to sacrifice a human being against his will. But, the movie didn't seem to realize that, and seems to ultimately agree with our bigoted hero that being Christian = good, and being other-than-Christian = evil.    Finally, (and I know it's probably a mistake to look to closely at this for plot holes, etc., but...) it seems bizarre to me that the police officer could have thwarted the entire plot (and thus ruined their May Day plans, and future harvest), by simply giving in to the sexual advances of the hot, blond Landlord's daughter. That just... doesn't track to me, for whatever reason.    Other than those slight philosophical disappointments, The Wicker Man was a decent film to watch. It was well-acted, and there were a few times I felt genuinely uneasy. The town had something of the surrealistic and sinister feel of the Village from The Prisoner. Christopher Lee is magnificent (as usual) as the antagonistic Lord Summerisle. Defying pure category, the movie incorporates aspects of a musical, and does it well. It's pretty to look at, and the finale is appropriately stunning and horrific.    Not as thoughtful as I wanted it to be -- it contents itself with pre-packaged, mainstream morality when it had the opportunity to extend slightly beyond such -- but good fare nonetheless. Three and a half stars, rounded up to four.
B00005JPTK|4.0|\\"I Am Legend\\" is one of the few movies I saw at the theater in 2007 (I have 2 kids, one of which is an infant, so it's hard for me to get to the theater these days). I usually only go see a film at the theater if I am VERY interested in it. Other than that, I wait for the DVD release.    For me, paying to see this at the theater was WELL worth the money. I have not read the original book (but I plan to now that I've seen the film), so I really can't say how accurately the original story is portrayed. Regardless, I was RIVETED. I found the story to be very intriguing, suspenseful, sad, heart-warming, and downright nerve-wracking.    What really held my attention, though, was Will Smith's performance. He has definitely come a long way since his \\"Fresh Prince\\" days. This man can carry a role like a champion (I also recommend his peformance in \\"The Pursuit of Happyness\\" - it was Oscar-worthy). His performance took me in and made me sympathize with the character as if he were my best friend. >>>SPOILER ALERT<<< When he ended up having to kill his beloved pet, I was almost in tears. You could feel Neville's anguish and pain beneath his determination to find a cure.    Most of the detractors to this film seem to site the poor CGI effects that depicted the infected as being a major downfall of the movie. Yes, I've seen better, but this did not distract me or diminish my enjoyment of the film. From what I understand, the director originally had actors in make up and costumes to portray the infected, but it just didn't work and was not very convincing, so they decided to switch to CGI. Perhaps they were forced to do a \\"rush job\\" which resulted in subpar creature effects. Just my two cents' worth.    As for the DVD itself, the picture and sound quality are both very good, but the extras that are offered really aren't all that much to rave about. There are a few \\"animated comics\\" that take place in other parts of the world that have to do with the virus infection, but are unrelated to Neville's story. These comics are well-done and stylish, but they aren't very long. There really could have been more special features offered. A \\"making of\\" short would have been nice, but instead, you can download a digital copy of the film. Big woop.    This particular release also comes with an alternate ending not shown in theaters. In my personal opinion, the original theatrical ending was better. Again, just my two cents'.    All in all, \\"I Am Legend\\" was an excellent film worthy of adding to your home video library.

0743289692|4.0|I rushed through this book, as without question Ayaan Hirsi Ali has had an incredible life which touches on so much of modern history through 2 continents.  Yet she walked a fine line for me, as I found her to be more self-righteous than self-examining.  After her public statements against Allah in Holland ignited a backlash and much violence, did she wonder whether head-on confrontation was the ideal or most productive way to create the changes in the religion which can empower Muslim women?  I also found that when speaking on a general level, she was the biggest defender of Muslim women, but when speaking of the Muslim regufees and immigrants she encountered in Holland (many who were also women), her compassion fell short and she was more condescending.    Definitely a complex woman and a fascinating story.  And her perspective will leave you thinking.

B000BYA5GO|4.0|Five minutes into \\"Lord of War\\" I realized that I had seen this film before, except it starred Johnny Depp, and was about cocaine trafficking and was called \\"Blow\\". Yeah, there are a lot of similarities between \\"Lord of War\\" and \\"Blow\\", both plot-wise and in the style of the films.    \\"Lord of War\\" tells the story of Yuri Orlov (Nicolas Cage), a Ukrainian-American arms dealer, who brags about having sold guns to every army on Earth except for the Salvation Army. Although Orlov is a fictional character, the script is based on actual events and is so well researched that it is completely believable to the point of being scary. Orlov is a completely immoral character who is unashamed of what he is doing and the idea that people like him could actually exist is genuinely frightening.    From an entertainment point of view, \\"Lord of War\\" is not a fun film. The first half of the film, which details the rise of Yuri Orlov and his arms deals in assorted Eastern European countries is enjoyable enough, but I found the second half, in which Orlov moves into the war-ravaged African countries, to be depressing. The film is redeemed by an ending which I liked very much, but because of the scenes set in Africa, I probably won't be watching this film again in a hurry.    Nevertheless, Nicolas Cage is excellent in this film. Initially, I felt that he was just playing the same character that he has played in every other film, but Cage's portrayal of Orlov as a man whose soul has been totally destroyed by his actions, at the end of the film, is still haunting me as I write this. Overall, I preferred \\"Lord of War\\" to \\"Blow\\" because, unlike in \\"Blow\\", the makers of \\"Lord of War\\" weren't afraid to show Orlov for who he really is, a soulless man responsible for the deaths of millions.
B0012GVKVY|3.0|This is one heck of an entertaining movie, featuring some of the most seamless CGI I've seen.  The transfer quality - both video and audio - of this Blu-ray is fantastic; I'd easily use it as a title to show off the format.  Unfortunately, I can't, because I refuse to pay the ridiculous prices that Fox continues to put on its titles.  I can accept that new releases are more expensive, but I, Robot is a catalog title and the $27.95 price tag ($39.99 MSRP) is downright absurd, especially when every other studio out there sets catalogs (on Blu-ray/HD DVD) at $19.95.  My advice - rent it for now and buy when there's a sale.

B000YIGNKE|4.0|This 2007 BBC version of \\"Persuasion\\" first aired in the United States in January 2008 on PBS Masterpiece Theater.  Starring Sally Hawkins as Anne Elliot and Rupert Penry-Jones as Captain Frederick Wentworth, it retells Jane Austen's classic romance about two people with a once and future love.<br /><br />The story is familiar to Jane Austen fans.  Anne Elliot, daughter of a baronet, was persuaded at age nineteen to reject the marriage proposal of Navy Lieutenant Frederick Wentworth on the grounds that he lacked fortune.  Eight years later and still single, Anne  bitterly regrets her decision.  As her family departs its ancestral home to economize in smaller quarters in Bath, she learns that the new tenants are to be an Admiral and Mrs Croft.  Mrs Croft's brother, now-Captain Wentworth, has returned from the Napoleonic Wars wealthy with prize money and in search of a wife.<br /><br />Anne is repeatedly thrown into company with Captain Wentworth, who seems interested in her two young and eligible cousins.  An accident to one of the cousins at the seaside town of Lyme causes Wentworth to take renewed notice of Anne.  Anne will be favored by the surprising courtship of an wealthy cousin, setting the stage for one last opportunity to make the right choice.<br /><br />Compared with its 1995 predecessor starring Amanda Root and Ciaron Hinds, the 2007 version is shorter by a good ten minutes and has shaved the details of the storyline accordingly.  Anne's courtship by her cousin, and her relationships with her old school teacher in Bath are much abbreviated.  The climactic scene in the 1995 version, in which Anne defends women's constancy to Wentworth's mentor in the presence of Wentworth, is here played as a note sent by Wentworth that causes Anne to run breathlessly through the rainy streets of Bath to find him.<br /><br />The 2008 version features an attractive cast and equally attractive location shooting. Sally Hawkins and Rupert Penry-Jones have good chemistry as the two leads.  Hawkins is less stoic and more emotionally vulnerable in her portrayal than Amanda Root's much put-upon Anne.  The handsome Penry-Jones looks rather unweathered for eight years at sea, but is easily worthy of Anne's longheld love.  Anthony Stewart Head is marvellous as Anne's vain and pompous father.<br /><br />\\"Persuasion\\" is well recommended to fans of Jane Austen, who should find it entertaining and well-executed if taken on its own terms.toic and more emotionally vulnerable in her portrayal than Amanda Root's much put-upon Anne.

B000ZLFALI|5.0|Great movie and one that would be a collector item for anyone that loves the Beatles and their music. Brings back many memories - and it is nice to know that their music is still wonderful and so dynamic.
B00004ZB9D|4.0|From the beginning, Lenny Kravitz has been an enigma. He's a rock star with streamers in so many gene pools that his songs were often surprise packages of whom he'd be this year. He's a man with a soul obsession with Curtis Mayfield and Marvin Gaye, the idealistic rocker that worships John Lennon and Led Zepplin, and the modern pop rock desires that would have him emulate Prince and work with Madonna. He also plays guitar with a Hendrixian flair. Scope that over a decade's worth of music, and you get the culmination of tracks that compose Kravitz' Greatest Hits.<br /><br />Kravitz' crazy-quilt of style is a music fan's delight. From his early Beatles hommage \\"Let Love Rule\\" to the Princely message funk of \\"Mr Cab Driver,\\" Kravitz made an audacious debut on [[ASIN:B000000WH0 Let Love Rule]]. He came off as a one man flower-child, which made the sudden left-turn into the easy grooving [[ASIN:B000000WHP Mama Said]] shocking. But the Curtis Mayfield hit \\"It Ain't Over Till It's Over\\" pushed Kravitz into hitmaker territory. At the same time, those rock instincts were pushing the envelope as Guns and Roses guitar slinger Slash co-wrote \\"Always On The Run.\\"<br /><br />As he came more and more into his own voice, Kravitz aimed for the stadium bleachers and scored when the Hendrix styled \\"Are You Gonna Go My Way\\" became a mammoth rock radio hit and a retro-video smash. The insistently classic rock loaded [[ASIN:B000000WJA Are You Gonna Go My Way]] album remains his most consistent album, but it was the followup, [[ASIN:B000000W9V Circus]], that gave Kravitz his first top ten album. This time, the Zep influence howls from \\"Rock and Roll Is Dead.\\" But is was also where Kravitz lost focus, which is indicated by the fact that only two songs from that album are included here.<br /><br />Kravitz took a four year break, cut his hair, trimmed his musical excesses, and came back with [[ASIN:B00000J8XI 5]]. Focused and less dependant on retro-rocking, the slow build of \\"Fly Away\\" and the killer remake of \\"American Woman\\" (which was featured in \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\\") captured an artist at the peak of maturity and prowess. \\"Black Velveteen\\" returns full-circle to his Prince fascination. It wraps up Kravitz first decade, along with a powerful new song \\"Again.\\"<br /><br />As collections go, it serves its subject well. Lenny Kravitz' classic rock identity crisis made for fascinating musical evolution before finally resolving itself. Given that his career since has held steady ([[ASIN:B00005QCNW Lenny]] to the recent [[ASIN:B000RWCRSE It Is Time For A Love Revolution]]), Volume Two will probably just as solid as this best of.erican Woman\\" (which was featured in \\"Austin Powers: The Spy Who Shagged Me\\") captured an artist at the peak of maturity and prowess. \\"Black Velveteen\\" returns full-circle to his Prince fascination.

B00000J7JO|5.0|I've been a fan of RHCP for years now.  But had only bought one of their albums before now (Stadium Arcadium).  So i decided to remedy that and i purchased Californication.  I had only heard a couple songs on the cd (Scar Tissue and Californication).  Both of which i really enjoyed and with the exception of maybe three songs on this cd.  I found Californication to be a great trip into the minds of the Red Hot Chili Peppers.  If its any indication of how good this one is.  I will be back down that road again in the future buying another buy the guys as they all seem to be on a different level on this cd.<br /><br />Check out tracks like Parallel Universe, Scar Tissue, Other Side, Californication, Easily, Savior, Right on Time and the mind boggling Road Trippin.  Californication is a cd that i know will get many plays by me now and in the future, a worthy purchase either used or new.  It's very wise to invest in this one as the various reviews say,  but don't take my word for it drop a few dollars on this one.  It's worth it.

B000EDWKXI|4.0|With all the actors/actresses in this one.  It only adds a greater air of quality to this movie.  Casanova warrants a buy if only to see how Heath Ledger handles this role of a womanizing player.  Who can get any woman that he desires but he can't get the one that he actually loves played by Sienna Miller.  Who plays a researcher/writer with headstrong views on the place of women in the world at that time.  Also enjoyable is Oliver Platt who plays the man that she's signed and sealed to marry even though she's never met him.  Which is exactly where all the hilarity and fun ensue in this movie and without throwing too much out on this one.  Everyone has a thing or two going in this one and a certain someone from Heath's past will play a prominent role in this movie as well.<br /><br />Even though he's passed on.  He plays the Casanova role with such energy, commitment and devotion.  I can't help but not being able to see him anymore new movies.  But as it stands for this one, its not only about his character but the vast array of people that bring the story of Casanova to life.<br /><br />Pretty decent ending as well.

It is certainly the best bang for your buck and it's a good choice for around $400.  I consider myself just an avid amateur photographer so I couldn't justify spending over $1000 for a luxury lens.  The issue isn't exactly money but matching gear with your own skill, experience and use.  I take sharp, well exposed pictures with the EF 28-135mm and am not disappointed as it has handled various situations well for me.
B00005J6T1|5.0|One Of Madonna's Best,And One Of My Favorites CDs ,A Classic ,And A Must Have
B00004WIDQ|5.0|This movie probably doesn't require reviewing at this point, but for the sake of continuity in reviewing movies I watch over the weekends, I feel I have to do it.  Obviously this movie needs no introduction at this point; it's already considered one of the best films Spielberg produced.  It all started with a book written by Michael Crichton, and whoever said it would make a great movie is now, clearly, a millionaire.  This is one of those things where the million dollar idea is true.  Granted the novel to movie transfer isn't a hundred percent, but few novels that go to movies are.  I've personally never read the book, but from people who have, they've told me it's not hugely inaccurate, so that's a good sign.  Granted a novel is almost always better than the movie, but I'll still watch the movies if they don't change the novel a ton.<br /><br />The movie was expertly executed, as the billionaire in the film is apt to say \\"we've spared no expense\\".  The story is based around a live zoo-like theme park where the billionaire has spent a large amount of money on research to figure out how to reconstruct dinosaur DNA so they can physically bring them back to life with what we know about genetic research already.  As you can see it's a very ambitious film.  The story is very impressive from the perspective of a \\"what if\\" scenario.  It's probably not all that applicable in the real world, but it certainly is a great premise for a film and it's presented in a fashion that seems like it's almost possible.  I think that fact alone makes the movie even more impressive to watch.  Also they seriously ramped up the industry of animatronics to produce this film!  Huge amounts were spent on the robotic elements to make the dinosaurs interact with the world in a very realistic fashion.  This was an ingenious move over having computer graphic dinosaurs.  I think, even by 2008's standard, CGI would do it a disservice!<br /><br />Basically the billionaire character, Hammond played by Richard Attenborough (famous for his documentary narrations), has a problem in opening his park, which is located on a remote island.  His investors and officials won't let him open the park to the public unless it's examined by a team of experts.  The movie is about that team's examination, sounds kind of boring from what I'm saying, but that is until something goes wrong.  The viewer is astounded by the sheer beauty of the creatures and the park throughout the entire film.  They developed special grids that are fenced off with high electricity wire... that is until the power goes out.  This is where the movie gets really exciting.<br /><br />My favorite character was the paleontologist Alan Grant played by Sam Niell.  I have to say, I like the characters Sam Niell typically plays and this movie was no exception, but maybe I'm slightly biased in this perspective.  Granted the third Omen wasn't anything special, but I thought Niell was really good in the film in the end!  Jeff Goldblum's character, Ian Malcolm, was pretty good, but he does get a little annoying once in a while.  That's kind of his point though.  I have to admit that I still don't quite understand why a Chaos Theory Mathematician was needed to survey a park about dinosaurs.  I understand the paleontologists, but not the mathematician, it just seemed out of place to me.  Maybe it was explained in the book.  Many people will enjoy seeing some smaller characters roles show up, such as the one played by Samuel L. Jackson.  Granted he's not as bada** as he normally is in films.  Sienfeld fans will surely appreciate the appearance of Newman as the character Dennis Nedry who interacts with Sam Jackson a lot and that pairing was simply a great idea!  It made those scenes pretty funny.<br /><br />There were a few scenes here and there that were mentally jarring because some parts were just silly and characters probably wouldn't do that in the real world, but the point was to create a suspenseful moment or tomove the story along.  So I suppose I can forgive the part where Grant tells Malcolm not to move and then Malcolm does... it made for an intense moment.<br /><br />Anyway, I don't want to give very much of the film away just in case someone hasn't seen it.  I know, that sounds shocking at this point, but I know people that have never seen the original Star Wars films and that just shocks me.  Either way this movie is superbly filmed and very well written.  I simply can't recommend it enough and I can't really think of someone who wouldn't enjoy the sheer adventure of this film.  So take a nice tour through Jurassic Park if you haven't seen this yet, they've spared no expense.pose I can forgive the part where Grant tells Malcolm not to move and then Malcolm does... it made for an intense moment.

B0010X73ZG|5.0|The Mist was always one of my favorite stories, I just really enjoyed the thought of a slew of Lovecraftian creatures residing in an unnatural mist and the fight for survival that unfolds from there. So when I heard there was going to be movie made about it, I was incredible excited, but also a little worried. More often than not Stephen King adaptations have been less than enjoyable, but there are exceptions of course, \\"The Shining\\", \\"The Shawshank Redemption\\", etc. But for every excellent adaptation there a half dozen stinkers. But then I heard Frank Darabont would be helming this, and my excitement in the project was once again rekindled. I was not disappointed. Not only is this a faithful and quite simply excellent adaptation, it actually surpasses the original story by fleshing things out more. A true rarity. This character-driven horror film is one-of-a-kind, with an ending you know is coming, but still can not help but be chilled to bone by it. To horror fans, I say buy this now! But even if you do not like horror, I know you can still find enjoyment in this movie, it is just so competently done, anyone can take something away from it. The acting, production, atmosphere, everything about it just exudes brilliance. I also enjoyed the lack of music up until the end of the movie, as that just added to the suspense of the movie. And then the only song used was so perfectly chosen, a \\"Dead Can Dance\\" like dirge that was as ominous as it was beautiful. In my top movie list of all time for sure.<br /><br />Bonus: Frank Darabont has acquired the rights to make a silver screen adaptation of \\"The Long Walk\\", my favorite of all the Bachman books. I just hope it is not an eternity waiting for this one to come out.

B0011NVC98|3.0|I bought the latest Beowulf DVD because I love the epic poem. Criminy, I use imagery from medieval times in my own work; I should devour this thing, right? Not so much. Although the story Mr. Zemeckis directed included the famous Grendel scenes, it extended to include the rest of Beowulf's life...but not in a way that I felt was very faithful to the tone of the original poem.<br /><br />Disappointing computer movements aside (I just couldn't get past a cartoon wench washing a mead hall table in what was supposed to be a seductive manner - and one had to assume she was supposed to be seductive because of the gasping noises she was making as she \\"jostled\\" her bosom around), this movie version of Beowulf's life introduced elements that made me go \\"hmm...\\" As someone who has read the Cotton Vitellius manuscript in both Old English and current, I don't think I would have missed some of the things that got thrown in there for modern-day effect.<br /><br />Did Mr. Zemeckis think the overall audience so brain-dead that we needed the extra features to modernize the story for us? Beowulf is the original monster story. It's the original hero story. It's the original good-versus-evil thriller. There's enough treachery, rescue, blood-and-gore, and evil beasties to appease even today's violent society. If you aren't already familiar with the poem, and if you can look past the CGI, you're going to love this tale! (To be truthful, the CGI was very well done - albeit a bit \\"jerky\\" for me at times.) But I can't get past the fact that, for me, the extra bits detracted from the story. They took me further out of the movie than the computerized characters.<br /><br />If you want a good blood-fest with naked cartoon characters and a simpering villain that you can see Tolkien's Gollum in, then this is your movie. If you want something true to the epic poem that will help you write an A+ paper in your English Lit class...well...you might look elsewhere. Or at least be careful how much to take away from this gem. Your teacher might figure out you didn't read the book, if you catch my drift.<br /><br />From Sandy Lender, \\"Some days, I just want the dragon to win.\\"Your teacher might figure out you didn't read the book, if you catch my drift.

B00005KAQP|5.0|I love \\"Sister Act\\" almost as much as I love Whoop! This movie is just tailor-made for Whoop, isn't it! Whoopi is totally perfect, and hilarious in every single scene. This is also a great movie that your entire family will enjoy because it is very wholesome and has a great upbeat message. Whoopi Goldberg gave a very Oscar-worthy performance just as she did in [[ASIN:B000LE16VW Ghost ]] (another one of her best movies!) Perhaps the reason why she wasn't nominated though was because the role was too perfect, maybe the academy could not see where the character began and where the person ended?     OK if you are one of the 2 people on the face of this planet who still have not seen \\"Sister Act\\" allow me to tell you what it's about. Whoopi plays Deloris Van Cartier, a fast-talking singer at a fleabag Reno casino. When she goes back to confront her married lover (Harvey Keitel plays the mobster-with-a-heart, Vince) she eyes a hit!    Poor Deloris is literally rolling for her life when Vince sends his boys after her! Deloris finally makes it to the police and Lt. Eddie Souther (Bill Nunn) arranges a very secret (and funny) place to stick Deloris at! A convent, where else! The rest of the movie is all about sweet Catholic love! I could not stop laughing when the Reverend Mother (Maggie Smith) first met Deloris, complaining that \\"this woman is designed to stick out.\\"      Whoop now has a new home (a convent) and a new vocation (a nun!) and a new name. Everyone in the convent knows her as simply Sister Mary Clarence. All the nuns take to her immidaitley because Mary Clarence is a lot like Whoopi. She's sweet and funny and bubbly and doesn't know when to shut-up!     I love the part when the Reverend Mother forced \\"Mary Clarence\\" to fast because she wouldn't stop talking. So funny! Pretty soon Mary Clarence decides to transform the chior into something halfway musical. My favorites in the choir are probably your favorites as well: the very bubbly and happy Sister Mary Patrick(Kathy Najimy before she lost all that weight,) the somewhat meek nun-in-training Sister Mary Robert (Wendy Makkena) and the no-nonsense Sister Mary Lazarus (played by veteran character actress and everyone's favorite amorous neighbor, Miss Cathcart, otherwise known as Mary Wickes.)    When Whoop decided to run out to the biker's bar (conveniently located adjacent to the convent) I could not stop laughing. It was actually Kathy Najimmy as Sister Mary Patrick who stole the show. She went absolutely nuts when she saw a jukebox and just had to have 1 dance.     Over the course of her brief time there \\"Sister Mary Clarence\\" did a lot to change things in the convent and in the community. She actually went out and met people and got down on their level. She opened her church doors to all and like Jesus, had a \\"come as you are\\" philosophy. Mary Clarence also recruited the help of the convent, especially the girls from her choir. Everyone was very pleased with what  \\"Sister Mary Clarence\\" accomplished, except for the Reverend Mother who felt like it wasn't her place.     Shockingly, Vince and his thugs were able to track down Whoop and came by to kidnap her! When the nuns found out, of course they all decided to go to Reno to save her. And as Sister Mary Patrick said: I bet Reno is just bursting with sin. Even the somewhat crotchety Reverend Mother got into the act guilting a charter company into flying them all in!    The Sisters finally catch up to \\"Mary Clarence,\\" who by now, they all know is actually Deloris Van Cartier; said with a touch of sarcasm and a wave of her wrist and a sly look in her eye by Sister Mary Lazarus. When Vince's boys can't shoot Deloris he threatens to do it himself saying, \\"I know that woman and she ain't no nun.\\" Of course the Reverend Mother defended Deloris again and assured Vince that she was in fact a real nun.    As I sated, I absolutely love this movie. It is so funny and the singing and performances by all are second to nun (pardon the pun!) And I think Whoopi actually sang some of the songs, but I could be incorrect. I also enjoyed this movie very much because it had some great life-affirming lessons. Deloris learned that her life did have meaning and she learned that she was better than what Vince thought of her. I learned that a church can only be as strong as its weakest member but it also has the power to do so much good. For some Christian action pick up \\"Sister Act.\\"

B000PTYP5C|5.0|An excellent album, is a combination of heavy metal during the first half and melodic/progressive in the second half, just like Dream Theater does. I really like it.  The DVD shows the making of the album.........is like a \\"reality show\\" of the entire album, very interesting. There are interviews to the members, some funny things during the recording and technical info of the recording process.  In addition, I live in Chile and I did not have any problem with the payment and the arrival date.
B00005MP58|5.0|I absolutely loved this movie and have watched it twice already since I purchased it a month or two ago. It's long, but much better than the newest re-make of Pride and Prejudice (only 2 hours long). Not only does this movie keep track with the book, but who could object to watching Colin Firth?!
0937381888|5.0|I started brewing around Christmas time, and got this to learn a bit more. I am bottling my first partial on the weekend, all grain soon to come!    John uses very easy to understand language, and the scientific sections can be avoided - there are normally summaries if you are not interested. I have found this very useful - if you are new to brewing, you probably will too.

1577314808|5.0|Eckhart Tolle's \\"The Power of Now\\" is one, if not the best, of the enlightening, personal development and inspirational books of our time. Not only are the examples of irrational behavior easily recognized, but the path to spiritual enlightenment is provided in the form of practical excercises and self examination. Together with his new book \\"A New Earth\\" these two books have the potentional of revolutionizing and awaking humanity before it is too late.
B000UJ48V8|4.0|I love this movie.  I really like the drill instructor (R. Lee Ermey) and his ability to bring realism to the roll.    The HD version of this was what I would expect from Kubrick, raw and uncut (mostly).
0743486285|5.0|I am and also will be a Motley Crue fan-in an herculean way. I have always loved Nikki Sixx and yes I knew he was the lyrical prodigy of the group. Yet, when I read this book and realized while I was having my 14th surprise birthday bash complete with Nikki Sixx portrait cake-Nikki was hiding in his closet (needle in arm-shotgun in hand).<br /><br />I could not put this book down. It was deviantly addictive.It was so parasitic, devouring my willpower prohibiting me from carefully walking away . Watching him unravel, yearning for what was brewing inside his infested vortex of an existence. This is the book. Kids, addicts, parents reality for all. This is REALITY puked up in your face as if it was projectile vomitted by Linda Blair herself. I'm sure his shananigans were infamous but he should also be given great nobelity for his honesty. Hey Oliver Stone get typing damn it.<br /><br />The only misconception I was disappointed to read was the info on Robbin Crosby's AIDS' contraction. I loved Ratt and King will be sadly missed. AIDS is horrendous and it stole my hero-Freddie Mercury; however, with all the promiscuity, swinging, swaping and syringing-disease was mestatisizing in a realm of sexual petry dishes.. All and ALL AWESOME BOOK and NONA is upstairs staring down an angelic goddess with her halo and wings smiling-SO PROUD..
B000MXPE74|4.0|These guys sound like they had as much fun making this CD as I'm having listening to it.  There's nothing too precious or trendy, just some good old fashioned rock-n-roll done with exactly the right attitude.  PS:Love the jacket art!
B0013D8LOK|1.0|It would have been nice had Tim Burton produced a \\"Sweeney Todd\\" that did a certain amount of justice to Steven Sondheim's masterwork.  Unfortunately, what Sondheim wrote and Burton put out bear only the most casual resemblance to each other ... namely, they have a lot of the same words and much of the same music - assuming that you prefer Shakespeare's witches acting like Wagner's norns (Anna Russell: \\"this dreary set of women\\"), or prefer Beethoven's 5th taken at the tempo of Chopin's funeral march.  Blech!<br /><br />It should be noted that there are already available 2 other versions of this opera (yes, I know it has spoken dialogue, but so does Carmen when it's done properly).  Both star the talented George Hearn as Sweeney.  One is the 1982 fully staged version with Angela Lansbury grasping immortality as Mrs. Lovett.  The other is the 2001 concert version with the great Patti LuPone.  Ms LuPone does an undeniable star turn in this role, but fails to achieve Lansbury's high orbit.  Hearn is a tremendous Sweeney, although in 2001 he's showing the 19 elapsed years since the last recording.  I would recommend either of these entries, although my recommendation of the 1982 version is unqualified, enthusiastic, and excited.<br /><br />And now Tim Burton tackles the Demon Barber.  Burton is an erratic director who often hits the heights but here sinks to a new low in this thing that is less a performance than a travesty.<br /><br />The reader may notice I mention none of the other performers.  This is done mostly to protect the innocent.  They do well enough, but their quality is still leagues from the 1982 version.  As in nearly everything that went wrong with this Sweeney, I blame the director.<br /><br />Somebody must have told Burton that Sweeney Todd is a dark comedy.  He seems to have forgotten about the \\"comedy\\" and concentrated on the \\"dark\\" - to great excess, alas.  Practically everything is filmed through blue filters - which may have been considered clever technique 50 years ago but is now just a strain on the eyes.<br /><br />On first viewing the film, and assuming you know the score, the first thing you will notice is the complete absence of the chorus.  Considering the deep relationship between Sweeney and Greek theater, this omission is akin to dropping the witches from Macbeth.  It is this omission that robs the work of its dimensionality and causes the ending to fall flatter than last week's souffl&eacute;.<br /><br />Aside from the directorial murder of the chorus and its music, this performance contains a number of omissions, truncations, and abbreviations.  The flagellation scene, as I recall, is gone.  The Todd-Pirelli contest contains only the shaving part, not the tooth-pulling half.  (This omission is fairly common in performance, alas).  The Beggar Woman's part is excised by about 50%, including most of the best bits.  The \\"God, That's Good\\" number is foreshortened to the point of being seen on edge.  The wildly funny lead up to Beadle Bamford's murder is gone.  And so on and on.  Somebody should remind Burton that this is a recipe for hash, not honest roast beef.<br /><br />Burton's directorial aim seems clearly to rob Sweeney of almost every ounce of its considerable humor.  He fails, and there's enough left to cause us to go into deep mourning for the rest.  \\"Hello, my name is Tim.  I'm here to make sure you don't have any fun.\\"  He seems to desire the players to be a funereal in their acting as possible.<br /><br />As a result, a great actor like Johnny Depp is converted into somebody you'd never want to see or hear again.  Depp, clearly too young for the role, is made up to look like somebody in a 1930s horror flick instead of someone who's spent nearly 2 decades in the penal sloughs of Old Australia.  He plays Sweeney as if the man were loopy, which he isn't.  He has a detached, dreamy delivery and never, NEVER catches fire.  I suppose this approach may be considered interesting in a sort of abstract way, but mainly it's boring and tedious.  Despite all the cuts, the film is only about a quarter-hour shorter than the 1982 and 2001 versions ... yet it seems to drag out a lot longer.  You do the math.<br /><br />Perhaps the weakest link in the whole cast is Helena Bonham Carter, who is manifestly too young to play Mrs. Lovett.  Her makeup may be intended to age her, but merely gives her a tired and haggard appearance.  Lovett's first appearance should wrench the viewer's attention onto her relentlessly.  Bonham Carter's first appearance gives us time to see if there are any pictures on the ceiling.  The less said about \\"Have a Little Priest\\", probably the better.  There are a few clever moments, but only in the sense of a convergence of a visual clue to the lyrics ... a technique that doesn't hold up well with repetition.  Bonham Carter's motherly effusions over Toby wouldn't convince a 3-month-old puppy.<br /><br />Speaking of puppies, the staging of this dog omits the original wonderful mechanistic set in favor of a more realistic presentation of London.  This can be understood, since films generally try to transcend the limitations of the stage.  In this case, however, the relationship of staging with plot is too organic to be so lightly dismissed.<br /><br />Look, guys ... if you buy this you'll regret it ... maybe not now, but later and for the rest of your life.  (Thanks, Rick.)  Try the Lansbury.
B0000062GK|5.0|Joe Satriani is one of a kind. If his other cd's didnt prove it already, this one does! Ever since his masterpiece Surfing With the Alien, Satriani has been on a roll releasing great albums. So much emotion flows through his guitar, no words can not express and thats why his guitar does it for him! Song after song, brilliant guitar playing is heard. It always amazes me every time i listen to it. \\"Love Thing\\" has to be one of the best songs I have ever listened to. Some other favorites from the album are \\"Crystal Planet\\" and \\"Ceremony\\". \\"Time\\" gives such an intense feeling, its unbelievable! Buy this album now, you will be satisfied!

B000002UAO|5.0|The Beatles-Rubber Soul *****<br /><br />Rubber Soul was maybe the equivalent of quantum leap for The Beatles. While they always made great music, even before this, it was with the release of Rubber Soul that the most popular band in the history of music came into their own.<br /><br />With songs like 'Norwegian Wood' and 'Nowhere Man' the songwriting team of Lennon/McCartney became REAL songwriters not just writers of pop jingles, especially Lennon, who was more talented in the field of lyrics. 'In My Life' and 'Michelle' would both go on to become radio and fan favorites. But not to totally turn away from their past Rubber Soul does include 'Drive My Car' are pop anthem worth every acclaim that 'I Wanna Hold Your Hand received a few years before.<br /><br />Rubber Soul was the first real classic The Beatles would ever release, an in my opinion is far better then that of Abbey Road, The Beatles (white album), and the incredibly over-hyped Srg. Peppers. This may not have been as experimental as those releases but is in every respect as good. Rubber Soul was for the Beatles what Bringing It All Back Home Was for Bob Dylan. Essential.
0307388840|1.0|Yes, I'd love to know who makes up the panel that decides what are well written books, or award winning stories.  And they made a movie out of this??  Those were the most boring first 189 pages I've ever read, and that was just to get half-way through the book.  The only reason I continued on is because I was reading it for a book club discussion.  The amount of excrutiatingly boring details was just more than I could bear!!  Sorry to say (after all the buzz I've heard about it) but I'll definitely stir away from anything else McEwan has written.
B000WS4QJG|5.0|Michael Jackson-Thriller 25th Anniversary *****<br /><br />You have to admit that after all these years the music on Thriller still holds up well and maybe that is because of the great production on the original (now remastered to sound even better) or maybe it has something to do with the fact that every hip-hop, R&B act today is trying to do what MJ did years ago so his music just flows still.<br /><br />The rehashing of one of the greatest/biggest selling albums of all time is perfect. The original tracks (Beat It, Billie Jean, Thriller, PYT, Starting Something, ect...) are all here and sound just as revolutionary as they did when first released. But what is cool about this is the dvd with the Thriller video and other bonus stuff, it makes a great addition. I am indifferent to the new tracks with modern artists but they still make a cool addition for die-hards and collectors.<br /><br />The 25th anniversary of Thriller was treated just they way it should have been. This reissue of an already classic album is fantastic and one that true fans of MJ will love, and that is saying something because this style of music is really one that am not usually a fan of. A real pop classic.

B000002L9B|3.0|Prince-Parade ***1/2<br /><br />This is rare of a Prince album released in the 1980's. almost everyone of his albums from that decade broke new ground musically one way or another and this one really fails to do so, which is really disappointing. Parade is the soundtrack to Prince's second film \\"Under A Cherry Moon\\" which was meant to be a romantic comedy but came off as awkward and flopped horribly. They album however didn't flop because of the hit single 'Kiss' but with out that this album would have flopped easily.<br /><br />The musicianship here is average, and for Prince that is, well, sad. He is easily one of the most talented musicians in history and here he just seems not to be trying. 'I Wonder U' is a awful song lyrically and vocally but musically I think it is great. The weird southern fried funk thing he does somehow works and sounds amazing. 'New Position' has potential but falls short. The slow grooveless piano driven 'Under The Cherry Moon' however is a breath of fresh air. 'Girls And Boys' should be a classic. 'Kiss' was the big hit and is one of Prince's all time great songs, especially since it is yet another groove without the essential goove instrument...bass. 'Kiss' especially stands out on this album because of the mediocrity it is surrounded by. The album closes with 'Sometimes It Snows In April' which is among if not the very best song that Prince has ever written, it is especially stunning when done live, and is the perfect song to close the album. The rest of the album is hit or miss and not very memorable making this album a disappointment.<br /><br />Every song on parade had the potential to be a great song but I think Prince's focus was more on the film then on the album making the music suffer. It is not a total waste however, it is fun once and a while, and is worth owning for 'Kiss' but since you can get that on any hit collection this album is worth owning for 'Sometimes It Snows In April' as to my knowledge this is the only place it is available.
B00004YWEA|5.0|It is really kind of pointless to say anything new or relevant about a album that most people my age have heard about a billion times from beginning to end. This does not in anyway diminish its greatness, it's that almost everything said about this monolith to hard rock has already been said. It must have been earth shattering to be back in July 1980 and to have just come home from the record store and thrown this on the turntable...can you imagine... hearing those ominous bells toll out, and that riff...descending, incessant and lethal. AC/DC literally came back from the dead with a career saving move that would solidify their status as true rock immortals. What makes 'Back in Black' so devastating is the care given to the song quality - the structure, lyrics, guitars, rhythm section and production are all spot on and flawless! Mutt Lange may have dominated Def Leppard to create 'Star Wars for the ears' but with AC/DC it was more of a true collaboration. He doesn't interfer with the song quality so much as to give each track its much needed space and allow the band to just expand on their own terms - something he never did with Leppard - credit to the Young bros. who not doubt had very much control over how their sound was captured. Brian Johnson of course was Bon Scott's replacement and unfortunately it was only on this record that he held his own - his voice and lyrics were never better. \\"Hells Bells\\", \\"Shoot to Thrill\\", \\"Back in Black\\", \\"Money, Honey\\", \\"Have a Drink\\", \\"Noise Pollution\\"...I mean c'mon....everyone knows these tunes by heart....but this does not dimminish their greatness or make them stale. Only \\"Shook Me All Night Long\\" has suffered the overplayed, big hit syndrome (it's played at weddings for Christ's sake (people dance to it....hilarious!!)). 'Back in Black' needs to be in your collection and download every song...in the orignal sequence...and raise your glass to the memory of Bon Scott and the album made in his memory.
0930289234|5.0|A truly fun and entertaining read. I didn't get too much into comics until 2 years ago, so I'm glad I waited to read this. I don't think I'd have appreciated it without a solid comics knowledge.

The DVD of the making of this CD provides a valuable context to what these musicians had been through and make the experience of the album that much more potent for me--I'd recommend the DVD, as well. Ry Cooder does a great job with both.
B0011HOEY4|5.0|[[ASIN:B0011HOEY4 American Gangster (2-Disc Unrated Extended Edition)]]  This DVD is outstanding!!! I loved every minute of it and you will too.

Evidently, this DVD does not come in FULL SCREEN only WIDESCREEN version.  BEWARE!!! The description is misleading and the customer service department does not have a clue either.

140120306X|5.0|When the remnants of Murray's League resurface in the 50's, the reader's in for a treat. Unlike the first two volumes, the prose in the Black Dossier isn't featured as an extra, but forms an integral part of the storyline and is thus intertwined with the comic sections. Subtle references at fiction from Homer to recent television make this a erudite and fascinating read, in which one can always discover something new. But that's not all. Moore's complex and sardonicly humouristic stories make him one of the best in the grapic novel genre.

0618084746|5.0|In rebuttal to Douglas Moran's review on this website, I have to admit I am listening to \\"Lonely Hunter\\" on audio cd.  I chose it because it's quite a famous book & was pretty sensational in its day (I believe the early 40's). What makes it compelling to me is Cherry Jones's reading. I am Not Southern, therefore am both amused and admiring of her wonderful rendition of all the parts.  The dialogue of the poor, blacks and whites, could get tiresome (as it does in \\"Tom Sawyer), but hearing Jones read the part of Portia, for example, makes you love this character. Same goes for even the crazy Jake.  You can just see him!

Or to quote Spaceballs, \\"We ain't found ****.\\"        As far as the packaging is concerned, all I have to say is: WTF????      I'm keeping the disc in the clamshell case for a Best Buy Wedding Crashers promo.  I knew I got that thing for a reason.

B00003CXAA|4.0|I'll make this short. For being older movies, these are classics. I had never had any interest and finally broke down and ordered this collection. The movies are amazing. Even if you are not into this type of genre, there is a high chance you will enjoy these anyway. The story is deep and entertaining, whoever you are.<br /><br />My only complaint is the very very dark display for these movies. Tried it on several players and T.V.s. But at least thats a small complaint.

B000XTLUW0|5.0|...  But this stupid live set had to put it above just about every band that I like and love (aside from Dream Theater).  I don't typically buy too many live DVDs of bands, but, I had heard by a lot of people that Muse puts on one hell of a great show.  Since I would someday love to see them live personally, I figured I'd see what I was getting myself into.      I was a little constricted on time, but I got through just about all of the DVD portion.  Let's be honest, I didn't care about the CD part of it.  I DON'T EVEN LIKE THE SONG \\"KNIGHTS OF CYDONIA\\" THAT MUCH!  And they made it terrific on their show.  Everything was near perfect.  So thanks to this stupid set, I was late to an engagement I had to be at, because I seriously was completely enamored with their talent.  Matthew Bellamy sounds every bit as good live, as he does on the studio albums, if not BETTER!  There isn't all that much Origin of Symmetry or Showbiz on here, but, enough to satisfy I'd say.      I would point towards those who are huge fans of Black Holes and Absolution to buy this set first and foremost.  Buy it even if you love Showbiz and OoS.  Actually, just buy it.  Maybe if you're lucky, you'll miss tomorrow's really boring management meeting due to having too much damn fun watching Matthew Bellamy completely eradicate your chances of wanting to listen to anything else for the next couple of days.
B000005IRG|4.0|Very good- single is great.  But like Horse by Patty Smith it is probably over-rated by the cool crowd of the CBGB era.

First of all, the pilot for this show is the best pilot I've ever seen for ANY show EVER!!! I had to keep pausing it just scream out how good it was!!! I watch about a disc a day, which is saying alot since you an rarely catch me at home, but I've made time like it's a new relationship! This show is perfect and I'm telling everyone about it! Each episode is a one hour movie. I think I'm gonna have Supernatural viewing parties, that way I don't have to loan them out, lol!! I'm hooked!!! Just AMAZING!!!
B00004TJKI|5.0|The movie was just as good as I remembered it.  The acting was superb.  It was interesting to see how our idea of \\"proper\\" attire has changed.

B0013D8LOU|3.0|First off, I'll make note of it that I knew and loved Sweeney Todd first as a musical. I took part in my high school's production of Sweeney as well, so in a way my review may seem somewhat biased.<br /><br />The production values were clearly evident right from the moment the film went into it's opening sequence, although it quickly took away the element of surprise for what was to come next. I don't want to know what happens an hour into the movie prior to actually seeing it happen. And what was wrong with the original musical's opening? It introduced Sweeney through the townsfolk telling tales of his deeds, and the opening song really gets you pumped up for what's about to be presented over the course of the show. \\"Swing your razor wide, Sweeney, hold it to the sky-y! Freely flows the blood of those who moralize!\\"<br /><br />The blood, although a style choice, just felt like a poor substitute of the real thing. Sweeney Todd was meant to be dark yet humorous, and the only humor I found throughout the film was the clear lack of energy (particularly in Ms. Lovette, who really needs a good amount of energy and entusiasm for her character or she just tends to feel out of place and almost superfluous).<br /><br />Next, I didn't really appreciate the dialogue and scene changes from the musical, particularly since the other 80% of the film sticks to the original script. It helped make the movie fell choppy and thrown together.<br /><br />Overall I enjoyed the story, but not how it was presented. Fans of the musical will likely want to stay away.
B000AJIAOO|5.0|The cds are just taking my breath away. The music has it's on way by taking you over that other lead singers from bands can not. It's not just this CD it's all of them. The viedos you should so see the have a gothic fantasy about them all that are so amazing. This band will be in my number 1 of best chick lead singers. Please check all the music from them they will blow your mind. I really don't know what else to say really. It's just simply amazing.
B00004SZWD|5.0|This album is a master piece!  If you are A Stevie Wonder fan and you don't have this CD you're missing out on a true piece of American music history.  This is one of the best Albums ever produced.
B000002KYK|5.0|The version of Memories of Green on this album is just stunning and achingly beautiful. It is worth buying this album just to get this adaptataion of Memories of Green. That's precicely why I bought it. It's much better than the original Memories of Green.
B00132D808|5.0|You need to give Panic! at the disco's new album a listen! It's really interesting. It shows a lot of musical progression from them since their last LP. They have integrated many forms of musical styles into their own: folk, country, jazz, big band, classic rock, orchestra strings, and soooo many more!!! It's almost like a modern Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band. It sounds vintage and then at the same time it has a newness of it's own. It's the most creative, and musical LP I've picked up in a long while-- you won't be disappointed!
B0007IN318|5.0|POMPEII<br />Robert Harris<br />(Random House 2003)<br /><br /> Here in \\"Pompeii\\", a novel, author Robert Harris has told the story of the eruption of Vesuvius (August 24-25 A.D.79) in verbal technicolor and has given us a cast of many characters from a clean cut young Roman engineer (Marcus Attilius) down to a couple of crafty villains (Corax and Ampliatus) who are almost stereotypically evil, one employed to kill Marcus, the other the employer. There is mystery, romance, adventure, fact and history aplenty in this great tale and it's a great read for everybody from the high school student to this writer who is past 90. But it's pretty much a guy's book. I read it when it was first published and have just reread it for the joy of reading a good story.<br /> The plot is simple. The Aqua Augusta, a 200 year old engineering miracle runs from the springs near Rome for a hundred miles south round the Bay of Naples behind Vesuvius and behind Pompeii to the Roman naval base of Misenum at a constant decline of one inch per hundred feet to deliver water by gravity flow to Pompeii, Herculaneum and Puteoli. But on August 22, two days before the eruption, Marcus Attilius, the young engineer just seconded by higher authority to take charge of the aqueduct, discovers two things. One, there is sulfur in the water. Two, somewhere up the line - past Pompeii but before Herculaneum the line is blocked and unless reopened in 24 hours half the population of Campania will have no water!<br /> The first 200 pages of this well researched novel set the stage for the eruption. You are in the naval base with Pliny the elder, the old general and avowed naturalist, now retired, run to fat but not to leisure. You are also there with Ampliatus, ex slave, cruel master, self-made millionaire with a beautiful daughter (Corelia), an ambitious politician and completely evil. You sail in the fast trireme with Pliny from Misenum to Pompeii where Atillius gathers his workmen and his supplies and goes out to find the stoppage; and you are with him while he finds and frees the obstruction just behind Vesuvius.<br /> In the meantime strange things are happening - waves on the sea, but no wind, flocks of birds where birds should not be flocking, vapor rising from the ground, wine shuddering in the wine glass - not much, but some, and more than intermittently. You are immersed in Roman culture, well and authoritatively set out by Mr. Harris; and you tend to recall your high school Latin (if you had it)<br /> The obstruction freed, Attilius, fascinated with the mountain, goes to the top of Vesuvius where justice done to Corax and you see the crater just about to erupt. Then on the way down he is flattened by the first explosion; and the last 75 pages of the book take you into the explosion, into Pompeii and into the ash.<br /> I had always thought that when Vesuvius erupted everything happened at once; people died instantly where they were and where they were embalmed for centuries until excavation stared in the 1800s.  Not so. The eruption went on for 36 hours in various stages and included several things - a rain of pumice which covered the surface of the ocean to three feet and made it impossible for the rowers on the trireme to dip their oars, rocks raining - small ones, big ones - heat, vapor and the huge explosions accompanied by waves of heat (500 degrees centigrade) which brought instantaneous death and destruction. Some numbers: The original explosion released the energy of 100,000 Hiroshima atom bombs. 1.5 million tons of magma and lava exited the crater at a speed of Mach1 and reached a height of 35,000 meters before dissipating over hundreds of square miles of land and sea.<br /> All this is laid out in language which I have called verbal Technicolor. Great descriptive writing. When you are through with this great read  - and, yes, Attilius and Coralia do escape the inferno - you know you have been treated to a really good book which took your mind off the troubles of our contemporary world. And that's eminently worth while!
B0010ZR160|5.0|This is definitely a five star movie,  and I was pleasantly surprised by how good Casey Affleck was.  Ben should be proud.  I went to see it initially because of Dennis LeHane,  a writer who I adore,  and the wonderful Amy Ryan.   But it was so much more,  great dialog and exquisite mystery.  I was surprised by the ending,  and in the books featuring Angie and Patrick,  the two detectives,  I never got the impression that their relationship was over,  but this was the last book he wrote featuring these two,  sadly.  At least that's the way it appears to me,  I haven't been able to find any more books featuring them that came after this one.  I'm surprised the credits don't list Dennis LeHane more prominently, but maybe screenplay is everything.
B00132D808|5.0|I want to start this review off sayin that I am proud to call myself a PatD fan. Mostly, after listening to this album.<br /><br />I love it when a group does something completely different than what they did on their first album. It takes balls to do something different, and PatD does it well.<br /><br />I would probably say that \\"Nine in the Afternoon\\" is the only song that sounds like the first album. The funness, the cheekiness, all in this song. But, as you venture past number 2, what you get is an album that shows what the group was and still is influenced by.<br /><br />Yes, like another review has mentioned, the Beatles play a large role in the direction of the album. But, after really listening to the lyrics, yous ee that all the influence is in the musical arrangements, not in the poetry of Ryan's lyrics. You even get a few awesomely written interludes by Brendon. And, hearing Ryan's voice on a couple of tracks was a risk, but a well taken one.<br /><br />It's no wonder bands are scared to try something new. People rip them to shread. But, seriously, this album is what any real fan would want from their band. PatD is a group of 20-somethign men who are trying to find their niche in this candy-drenched pop world. There risk is well noted, and well done.<br /><br />Admittedly, it might take a few listens to get used to the change in tone and music arrangements, but its well worth it.<br /><br />A few gems: \\"The Green Gentleman,\\" \\"She Had The World,\\" \\"Mad as Rabbits,\\" and \\"When The Day Met The Night.\\" Also, take notice of the two interludes, they are awesome!<br /><br />For those who have written the album off for \\"trying to be the Beatles,\\" or \\"for going in another direction,\\" take a step back, look at the album for what it is, and recognize the genius of a young group taking a chane on being different than the mainstream.
B000P0J09C|5.0|Full Metal Jacket is one of the best films , Stanley Kubrick ever made. The film has humor, gut wrenching war scenes and brilliant acting. Matthew Modine is great as Joker, but it's Vincet D'Onforio and R.Lee Emery as Pyle and the Drill Sgt. The chemistry between these two actors is of David and Goliath calbiar. The film makes you feel like you're in basic training with the troops and although the film is violent it's still an art form. **** out ****.
B0000AR8NK|5.0|Outstanding video of the 'Reality' tour Dublin concert.<br />First: the vidoegraphy was by far the best I have seen in music videos with a perfect balance of lingering and fleeting, close-up and expanded, multi-color and black-and-white, pulsing and flowing...images mainly of Bowie performing, but also of the featured musicians as appropriate. Superb - worlds apart from those annoying, neurotic music videos that are a dime a dozen on MTV. Here, the cameras and editors have captured the essence of the genius of Bowie - the passion, the emotion, the brilliance. I have watched this DVD over a dozen times in a month and I am still blown away.<br />Second - and possibly more important: the music. The  sound balance is perfect. The band is probably the best Bowie has ever toured with. The keyboard player's solos give me constant goosebumps - on a par with the awesome piano solo on the studio version of Alladin Sane (probably the same guy!) In fact, on many of the songs, I prefer the live concert version to the original studio version - in particular the stripped-down version of 'Loving the Alien', my all-time favorite 'Ashes to Ashes' and the relatively unknown 'Bring me the Disco King'. I hardly paid attention to the studio version of the latter, but Bowie's vocal performance on this track especially was worth the entire DVD.  Bowie must be pushing 60 in this concert and yet his voice, personality and stage presence are the strongest I have ever witnessed.<br />Brilliance! Sheer brilliance.

B000NA28I4|4.0|This is a pretty good movie. Fun and interesting, but there are a few boring parts. Overall pretty good.
B0013FBS20|4.0|Having never read the book, I cannot comment on how the story transfers to the big screen, except to say that in most cases, the transfer isn't favorable, so to judge it based on that is unfair.    Visually, this movie is quite impressive. I've never actually been to Manhattan, but seeing the wildlife roam the streets littered with abandoned vehicles and plantlife, made me feel as if I had.    I had a couple of minor issues; one with the plot that I cannot mention without being a slight \\"spoiler\\" and the other with the rather abrupt ending, in my opinion.    This certainly didn't really distract from the overall experience & once again, Will Smith was wonderful mixing drama with his brand of comedy in precisely the right places.
B000AMJDHY|5.0|I, like many others, were introduced to this group thorugh the lively and ecclectic video for \\"I Write Sins Not Tragedies.\\" And, I, like many others, fell in love with a quirky group of young guiys and their tongue-in-cheek lyrics on this album.<br /><br />But, the album is nore than just quirks, and cheekiness. It's an album that shows not all young groups are crooners (although Brendon's voice could definately go there). It showed the pop/rock world that there was more out there than sugary, over-produced junk that was out at the time.<br /><br />On their freshman debut, PatD jumps out the box screaming and shouting. From the opening, the band shows us that they may be cuties (a bias I wanted to eject), they show that they have writing talent. The writing is funny, sarcastic, bold, cheeky, satirical, and plain fun. You get a sense of the poeticness of Ryan Ross' mind, and a sense of what adolescence was for him.<br /><br />The album falls short no where, and only soars past what I expected. I am definately a fan.<br /><br />P.s.---I'm off to write a review of the new album, so look for it!!!
B0004Z33EG|4.0|First Blood is action classic that makes you think. Stallone created a new franchise for himself in the form of John Rambo. Brain Denhey makes great bad guy and Richard Crenna as the father figure type is always good. The action sequences in the film are intense but below all that is a film with heart that makes you think.

B0002JP4L4|4.0|Footloose\\" is a fun and very lighthearted motion picture that promises a good time and delivers.    The film has a simple, if unlikely, plotline. Streetsmart but gentle teenager Ren MacCormack(Kevin Bacon) arrives from the big city with his mother in the backwater town of Bomont. Enrolling at the local high school, he is appalled to discover the town's adults have imposed a law on \\"public dancing\\" and rock music, as enforced and practiced by the local preacher(John Lithgow). Ren quickly sets about changing things, falling in love with the preacher's daughter Ariel (Lori Singer) in the process.    The story is a little unlikely yet it is perfectly suitable for the teenaged audience at which it is pitched. The script takes some time to explore its simple theme - dancing and rock music, and what they symbolise for young people. Three scenes help to lay this out. The first sees Ren dancing by himself in a barn; the town meeting where Ren presents his case to the townspeople and explains to them the meaning of the dance; and the final prom sequence in which the teens of Bomont revel in their newfound liberation.    As the leading man, Kevin Bacon carries off his role very well. Ren isn't really a macho hero revelling in coolness, he's a down-to-earth young man trying to the right thing by his peers. His romance with Lori Singer's character Ariel is formulaic but perfectly inoffensive.    The film could have perhaps done with a little more nastiness to fully contrast against Ren's earnest intentions. Even Ariel's brutish boyfriend(Jim Young) fails to inject much tension in this respect and the final fistfight between him and Ren comes across as being a bit lame.    John Lithgow's characterisation is very good but it is a little too subtle. As the town Reverend and preacher of all things pure and holy, his extreme views come across not so much as puritanical, just merely uptight. The change that eventually occurs in his attitudes is hinted at very early on. The result is that he is nowhere near is frightening or intimidating a character as he could have been. At the same time his troubled relationships with his rebellious daughter and quiet wife(Dianne Wiest) are very well written and acted. In these scenes he excels and his character's development seems very natural.    On the technical side, the film is well-shot and the gloriously Eighties soundtrack complements the proceedings very well, bringing the necessary exhuberance and bounce to the whole movie.    Whilst \\"Footloose\\" is certainly no masterpiece, it succeeds in being a lighthearted knockabout caper, and as such is a very enjoyable movie.

B000P6YNSE|5.0|I order Lost season 3 and received it within 3 days. The product was as advertised, \\"brand new\\"! Inside the box were all the cd's plus a booklet that briefly describes each episode. It is a must have for all Lost fans! I missed a few episodes during season 3 and now having watched the entire box set I understand certain aspects of the show that I didn't know. I had previously ordered season 2 from Amazon and it too was as advertised \\"brand new\\". I'm looking forward to when season 4 becomes available and will order that set as well. Amazon does as advertised in my association with them, thanks Amazon!!
B000WTNCYA|5.0|Melody had a unique style - kind of a mix between Norah Jones, Diana Krall and Eva Cassidy.  I thoroughly enjoy this CD and I don't get tired of it.  It is a fresh sound and her own style.  The mix is varied and she changes it up from bluesy to folksy to jazzy.  You will be glad you bought this CD!
B0002I831S|5.0|STAR TREK - The Original Series, First Season. I stayed to 3am every night watching until I finished the whole episodes! This is Sci-Fi at its best. The Plots in the original Star Trek are almost all story-and-character driven and each story is a classic in its own sense. Time travel? Nothing better than the classic \\"City on the edge of Forever\\", a story that will remain edged on your mind for a long, long time? Wandering where James Cameron got the ideas for his Terminator Series? The ideas are all there in Star trek starting with the very first episode \\"The Man Trap\\" in which you see a \\"morphing\\" character that obviously the T1000 in T2 was based on. \\"What are little Girls made of?\\"  is also a Robot Classic that I believe would have help Cameron conjure up the Terminator Series. By the way the morphing Character in \\"Man Trap\\" is female, so think of \\"T3\\".       I just wish Hollywood would remake some of the series as full length features with younger characters and bigger special effects. I would definitely like to see a modern remake of \\"The city on the edge of Forever\\" and \\"Arena\\" in which the \\"GORN\\" Monster is given better effects a more viciousness.       I just acquired the rest of the Original series and I foresee many sleepless nights ahead for myself!
B00007AJGH|5.0|Who Framed Roger Rabbit is one of the great films that I recall from childhood. Robert Zemeicks made a film that everyone can enjoy. Watching the film as an adult I noticed there's big a amount of sexual innuedno in this film the kind of humor that you have to be an adult to get. Bob Hoskins and Christopher Lloyd were in top form as the hero and villian in the film and we all know that the two best voice overs in the film were Charles Fleischer and Kathleen Turner. This is still one of favorite Zemekicks films so sit back and watch this for old times sake.

B000003CMD|5.0|Their concert at Fillmore East is their best and infact probably the best live album ever recorded. If you're looking for a Fillmore East continued, you'll be disappointed. But If you know going in that there'll be a country flavor to some of the disc, some blues and a tad-bit of jazziness to a couple of songs then you'll appreciate this. What makes this a classic is the familiarity and yet the unique feeling of the performances. One can not help but continually return to Jelly Jelly, Wasted Words, Pony Boy, etc.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|I'm not going to comment on the music, save to say that I like it, but I like almost everything that REM performs.    What I DON'T like is the absolutely horrible recording quality of this CD.    Are the people who run the record companies stone deaf ??  Can't they hear the horribly shrill highs ?  The distortion ?  The CLIPPING ??  Why have they allowed themselves to be sold a bogus bill of goods in order to participate in \\"The Loudness Wars\\" ?.    While Springsteen's Magic set the new standard for HORRIBLE audio, ACCELLERATE lags by only a nose.    You're better off taking your ten bucks and flush it straight down the toilet.  You might find the gurgling noise much more enjoyable.    I wish I could tell this to Messrs. Buck, Stipe and Mills personally.  I know that they've paid much more attention to the sonics in the past.  I can't understand how a group of artistic geniuses can release a work that is so obviously sonically inferior.  <sigh>

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Michael C. Hall moves as far away as he possibly ever could from his wonderful if somewhat flaky character in \\"Six Feet Under\\", and provides some very shocking moments indeed as Showtime's Dexter Morgan, the serial killer with a code. I absolutely adore this darkly comic series and it's one of many that had me glued to the TV last year. My summer vacation came up while the series was in mid-flow here and it was more convenient to just buy the DVD boxset than try to record the episodes I was going to miss while away and catch up upon my return. I'm so glad I made the purchase as I've watched the entire season through twice now and can't wait to watch it again, just before I get to see the eagerly anticipated second season.<br /><br />Dexter is a forensic specialist with the Miami Metro police. Blood spatter is his area of expertise so there's lots of blood. Lots and lots. Dexter is handsome, charming, a snazzy dresser and has an evil glint in his eye. He's also severely damaged psychologically and has a need - a compulsion to kill. He's been 'trained' however, by his adopted father, to narrow his scope of potential victims to those who 'deserve it'; usually those who have killed themselves but have, in Dexter's eyes at least, evaded justice. Hence the aforementioned code.<br /><br />The Miami police are hunting for a murderer dubbed the Ice-Truck Killer, so named for the way he leaves his victims. It's a relatively straight-ahead murder hunt story but the real meat comes from the rich but subtle subtext. Dexter is hot on the Ice-Truck killer's trail but it seems the killer is also hot on Dexter's. As the 12 episode series progresses and the cat and mouse game unfolds, we get closer and closer to finding out who the killer is. We also learn more about who Dexter is and it's not all pretty. Lines get blurred and I can only speak for myself but a point did come where the moral questions of the story - and there are many - began to seem less and less important. For all of Dexter's sociopathic (or psychopathic) tendencies, I found it strange to find myself rooting for him and even more strange to watch how he actually came across as the most sane amongst everyone around him - his neurotic girlfriend (and her abusive drug fiend of an ex-husband), his grasping, power-hungry lieutenant and his desperately emotionally needy sister, just to name a few - and it made me wonder who among us is completely sane, at the end of the day?<br /><br />The season builds skilfully to an ultimate climax that had me literally at the edge of my seat, barely daring to breathe.  It's all very cleverly done with great writing, even better acting, first rate direction, stunning Miami location scenery and crucial flashbacks.<br /><br />Hall is the star, I guess, but the series really works due to the incredible supporting cast, including Jennifer Carpenter, Lauren V&eacute;lez (a favourite of mine from back in the days of \\"New York Undercover\\" and \\"Oz\\"), Julie Benz, James Remar, David Zayas, C.S. Lee and last but not least, the oh, so sexy Erik King as Sergeant James Noakes. He seems to be the only one around who knows that there's more to Dexter than meets the eye. I don't usually go for big & beefy but I'd make an exception for King (who was also in \\"Oz\\", by the way) in a heartbeat. In my dreams, naturally :)<br /><br />If you haven't seen this, rush out and get it, watch it on TV now if it's showing in your area, whatever. If you can get past the blood and the cold-blooded killing, you'll be hooked.  Highly recommended.<br /><br />DVD extras include a 10 minute documentary about the work of a real-life blood spatter expert, called \\"Witnessed in Blood: A True Murder Investigation\\"; two episodes of the first season of another Showtime drama called \\"Brotherhood\\"; previews of other Showtime DVDs; biographies of the main cast and some more lovely stuff you can only access online by putting one of the DVDs into your computer.

B0013D8LOK|3.0|The movie was engaging, in the typical Tim-Burton way. However, it grew tedious on more than one occasion. The singing is not top quality (let's face it: the actors sing better than I would have, but they are nonetheless actors trying to sing), and the songs lack the choral backup that make the Broadway songs more textured (although Burton said this was intentional, in order to give the performance more of an 'introverted' take on things). Finally, the international cut of the movie is a little too grotesque than it needs to be, giving the movie an air reminiscent of the horror movies of the 1980s. A little more suggestion and less gore would've gone a long way. In summary, neither Burton's nor Depp's best work, but a good effort.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|This brought a lot of things to a good conclusion. Wish Richard Dean Anderson had been in the movie. Maybe the next one?!? I enjoyed everyones performances and the writing was great!
B0012K1ILW|5.0|When I first heard this disc I knew right away that the masses, including some of her most fervent fans, would be turned off by this off-kilter effort. Many of the one-star reviews here are a reflection of consumer taste rather than the quality of Ms. Badu's latest offering, which is a masterpiece, in my humble opinion.  Admittedly, the album does take a few listens to warm up to but once these funky, astral tunes reveal themselves to your soul you cannot deny Erkyah's otherworldly talent and incomparable inventiveness. Stand-outs for me are The Healer, Me, Soldier, Master Teacther, Telephone, and Honey, of course. She laces her lyrics with Nation of Islam ethics, politics, and spirituality. Some artists are deep for the sake of being deep but Erykah is distinctively deep here, and nothing seems gratuitous or contrived. Many contemporary consumers cannot appreciate change or challenge themselves to listen something new. Erykah has shattered the mold by breaking free from the neosoul strait-jacket, creating a masterful blend of hip-hop, funk-jazz-soul inflected tunes. This is E.Badu's, \\"There's A Riot Goin On,\\" one of the greatest funk albums of all time. Dismiss this album at your own peril!
B0013FXWU6|4.0|I must warn all would-be single-disc purchasers that this version comes in one of those crappy cardboard \\"jewel boxes\\", rather than the standard plastic \\"clamshell\\" versions. I'm sure the disc is going to get scratched, even with handling it with care.<br /> Thus, the 4 out of 5 star review.<br />Other than that, GREAT flick!
0199206589|4.0|I read this shortly after the Very Short Introduction to International Relation. The subject matters differ, but the style of the books vary even more so. Dodds takes a less staid approach.     Thus, in addition to the expected intellectual history of geopolitics, Dodds has a chapters on maps and on popular culture (movies, the internet). I haven't been in college for a while, but this strikes me as a contemporary  academic approach: here's a paragraph about geopolitics and gender, there's a discussion of the movie Behind Enemy Lines, here's a chart with a box labeled \\"spatialization [sic] of boundaries and dangers.\\"     Dodds will come across as a lefty by US standards. He's critical of the American approach to politics, he criticizes Hollywood for carrying the water of conservative government institutions, he's excited about the Zapatistas use of the internet, and he criticizes Bernard Lewis.
B000MRAAJM|3.0|After awhile you get tired of looking at this gorgeous stuff, but there are many stunning and unusual parts of this BR and the quality is great.
B000K7VHQE|5.0|I Loved this movie when I saw it at the cinema's so much I couldn't wait to see it again so I pre-ordered the movie from Amazon (US) to get it about 3 Month earlier than it was going to be released in Australia.    Every Performance is brilliant, and the final dance sequence had me & my friend in stitches it was so funny.    Just before I saw this movie I had been to the Foo Fighters Concert and the Sydney Opera house, and after the show my sister, her hubby, my brother & I were having a coffee & Cake at a cafe by the Harbour near the opera house, and Greg Kinnear was sitting just behind us, he must have been out to promo the movie.   But I just wish I had seen the movie before because I would have loved to tell him how much I loved the movie.  But anyway enough name dropping...    This is one of my All-time Favourite Movies    If you don't like this movie, you're probably a moron with no brain who just likes films with stuff blowing up.    I hope you enjoyed it as much as I do.
B000P12LWY|5.0|Totally enjoyed the first season.  It made me subscribe to Showtime so I could enjoy the second season as it unfolds.  Just make sure the kids aren't around.  It can get a little explicit.
B0002I831S|2.0|Although it is real nice having the set in one package, it is a shame that they did not have the foresight to think we might want to watch them in the order they were numbered, i.e. episode 2 before 3, 3 before 4, 4 before 5, etc.  They are on the disks in air date order, which is not the correct order, if you want to watch in actual order, you must juggle between disks.  Wait to purchase until the idiots at Paramount get it right.  Maybe this is why sales were not so good and went from $129 - $199 per season to less than $40.00 per season.
B0015AARJI|5.0|For the past year and a half something has been missing. You don't know what it is but theirs a void and somehow you want to fill it if only you could figure out what it is. You've played Resistance, Warhawk, Heavenly Sword, and Uncharted but something doesn't feel the same. Well worry no more your fears can now be relieved. Rumble is back to bring many of the PS3 best games to life. Granted we shouldn't have had to wait for this controller and its been a painful wait for Sony to settle the lawsuit and get the dualshock 3 into our gamer hands. But at least now its here and without it your truly missing out on that last bit of immersion games have been giving us for many years now.    Its not a new feature, of course, but its a necessary one. As a PS3 owner I've missed it and I've taken issue with Sony leaving it out of the sixaxis. No we can have our rumble and feel it too. The controller has a great weighty feel to it. Still includes the motion sensing of the original sixaxis controller. The rumble works on all of the best games, except for Call of Duty 4 but I'm sure a patch will be available in the future. You really can't ask for more. Its rechargable without the need to buy anything extra. Consider all the batteries you don't have to buy and it pays for itself.
B000V6BE6M|5.0|The difference with these complete recordings.. is the sheer weight of material. The theatrical soundtrack is a mere greatest hits by comparison. The  impression is that, after everyone has left the concert hall, you've been invited back, to listen to fruits of the exaustive and countless re-envisionings of this music for the film fleshed out in the grandest scope and the fullest form. If you were blown away by the third theatrical soundtrack, as I was, the new material will immerse you back into the rich and compelling power of Shore's music and the world of Middle-Earth. The sensitivity and innovation of Shore's score is that of a master at work. Highlights are the opening 'Roots and Beginnings' which was taken out of the final film, but which i my opinion contributes chillingly and devastatingly to the Sméagol/Déagol scene that opens the film, the tyrannical Mordor theme raging to the surface behind Gollums' cruel murder.    'The Eyes of The White Tower' is another powerfully moving piece which fleshes out the scene around the courtyard of minas tirith and in the confrontation between Gandalf and Denethor.'The Houses of Healing' also works beautifully with the vocal of Liv Tyler.    You may think the sheer amount of music would become wearisome and repetitive, but all throughout Shore weaves subtle and beautiful orchestral colours and themes mixed with the grandeur and mythical heroism  that echoes the spirit of Tolkien and that will have you coming back again and again
B0012X3ZGK|5.0|*** THIS REVIEW IS FOR THE 2016 CD REISSUE and REMASTER ***<br /><br />There are few Classic Seventies Rock fans that don't worship at the unfussy feet of ILPS 9120. But it's another decade, so we get another version with yet another sound – and despite its niggling flaws – what a barnstormer this 2016 reissue is.<br /><br />FREE fans will know that the October 2001 and February 2002 CD reissue campaign of all seven of their albums (six studio and one live) came with great Peter Mew remasters, decent bonus tracks and expanded booklets to match - and were mid-price at the time. Then fans were hit with the motherlode – the 18 March 2008 2CD 'Deluxe Edition' set of &#34;Fire And Water&#34; on Universal/Island 5306090 (Barcode 600753060902) with copious amounts of bonus cuts, previously unreleased material, tasty presentation and fab sound. There has been Japanese SHM-CD variants since and a recent beautiful Half-Speed Remaster on VINYL done at Abbey Road in 2016.<br /><br />But here we are in September 2016 with another CD reissue campaign of all seven albums accompanied by an eight - the &#34;The Free Story&#34; compilation (a 2LP set onto 1CD). Unfortunately these new 2016 single-disc versions strip away those brilliant bonuses entirely and unwisely substitute the hugely informative liner notes of the 2001 and 2002 issues for booklets with only band photos. Essentially for &#34;Fire And Water&#34; and we’re back to a straightforward transfer of the 7-track 1970 LP as is – but is another purchase necessary? I'd argue its 'essential'.<br /><br />Despite the neutering of bonuses and the information-less booklet and even the sloppy wrong-order of tracks on the rear inlay (see photos below) – this new 2016 reissue offers us one genuinely worthy consolation prize – a new 2016 ANDY PEARCE and an uncredited MATT WORTHAM Remaster that breathes wonderful naturalistic vitality back into the album.<br /><br />On buying and reviewing the underrated &#34;Highway&#34;, &#34;Free At Last&#34; and &#34;Heartbreaker&#34; CDs in this 2016 reissue cluster and loving their audio – I splashed out on more and the results are equally magical. In fact I'd say that &#34;Fire And Water&#34; here has had more real work done on it than ever before and fans will need this in their homes. Also with most of the eight being offered on Amazon at less than five pounds including P&P – you can of course argue that the price is right - and with their generic 'Island Remasters' see-through side panelling on the jewel case – they look good too. Here are the details for Mr. Big and his great big hole in the ground...<br /><br />UK released Friday, 9 September 2016 - &#34;Fire And Water&#34; by FREE on Universal/Island Remasters 473 187-4 (Barcode 602547318749) is a straightforward CD Remaster of the 7-track 1970 UK LP and plays out as follows (35:43 minutes):<br /><br />1. Fire And Water<br />2. Oh I Wept<br />3. Remember<br />4. Heavy Load<br />5. Mr. Big [Side 2]<br />6. Don’t Say You Love Me<br />7. All Right Now<br />Tracks 1 to 7 are their 3rd studio album &#34;Fire And Water&#34; - released 26 June 1970 in the UK on Island Records ILPS 9120 and August 1970 in the USA on A&M Records SP-4268. Produced by FREE and JOHN KELLY (Engineered by ROY ROGER) - it peaked at No. 2 on the UK LP charts and No. 17 in the USA.<br /><br />The six missing bonus tracks on the October 2001 Island Remasters IMCD 284 (Barcode 731458622727) version are: &#34;Oh I Wept (Alternate Vocal Take)&#34; from the &#34;Bumpers&#34; 2LP Island Sampler, &#34;Fire And Water (New Stereo Mix)&#34;, &#34; Fire And Water (BBC Session)&#34;, &#34;All Right Now (BBC Session)&#34;, &#34;All Right Now (Single Version)&#34; and &#34;All Right Now (First Version)&#34;. As you can see from this list of missing extras - your loss is considerable – most of these bonus tracks adding huge punch to the overall vibe of the 2001 reissue.<br /><br />The new booklet is 16-pages and shows an 8-Track Tape-Box photo of their most famous song 'All Right Now' on Page 2 (dated 8 March 1970) as well as other black and white photos of the band and the lyrics to the songs (which is new and welcome). Even without any album release info or background details (not even a catalogue number) – its actually the prettiest of the booklets I've seen so far. Beneath the see-through CD tray are pictures of the seven reissued albums with the eight being &#34;The Free Story&#34; double-album compilation from 1974 (for catalogue numbers see notes below) and the CD label repro's the UK Pink 'I' Label logo design of Island Records in early 1970. There's no liner notes giving history, details etc. and the track list for the album on the rear inlay is sloppily in the wrong order (the booklet is right).<br /><br />But a fabulous new master from ANDY PEARCE and an uncredited MATT WORTHAM – who did such great work on Pentangle, Frankie Miller, Thin Lizzy, Wishbone Ash, the 2012 Rory Gallagher CD remasters and most recently the 2016 Budgie 3CD Box Set and the new 'Deluxe Editions' of the Emerson, Lake & Palmer Island catalogue (see reviews for them all) - resoundingly compensates for all of that distasteful compromise.<br /><br />I've had the October 2001 single-disc Remaster and the March 2008 Deluxe Edition 2CD Reissues for years now – both of which rock – but this new September 2016 single-disc version is an entirely different aural beast. There's suddenly staggering naturality and presence to the whole LP. Pearce and Wortham let things breathe (it's a trademark of their work) – and this notoriously lo-fi recording which was apparently rejected by Island's Chris Blackwell on first hearing – has always been a brute to get right. In a recent interview with Andy Pearce on the old dog and bone – I've learned than he and Wortham (both huge fans of the band) spent more hours with “Fire And Water” than any of the others and are proud of the outcome (even if Universal forgot to credit Wortham in the booklet - a fact they're trying to rectify on the second run). The results are powerful to say the least. Their version is muscular and meaty. This is not loudness for loudness sake – not shrill so to speak – just in your face – huge power and presence - like an original tape should be. In short this CD sounds fabulous. On to the music...<br /><br />Prepped by the edited single of &#34;All Right Now&#34; in May 1970 which raced up to number 2 in the British charts (Island WIP 6082) - the vinyl album delivered what the public seemed to already know - here was a truly great British Rock band hitting its stride. And while Lead Singer PAUL RODGERS and Guitarist PAUL KOSSOFF always pull the plaudits – both SIMON KIRKE the Drummer and especially the Bassist ANDY FRASER added so much to the mix too. Andy Fraser was only 18 at the time and along with Rodgers they co-wrote five of the sevens songs - &#34;Fire And Water&#34;, &#34;Remember&#34;, &#34;Heavy Load&#34;, &#34;Don’t Say You Love Me&#34; and of course the mighty slayer &#34;All Right Now&#34;. Kossoff co-wrote &#34;Oh I Wept&#34; with Rodgers and Fraser also had a part in the fabulous &#34;Mr. Big&#34; as it was written by all four.<br /><br />The simplicity of &#34;Fire And Water&#34; is still touching somehow – barely any credits – no inner sleeve – just the basic cover and the music. The rear sleeve of the American LP on A&M Records (Tan Label) simply referred to the big hit single as &#34;All Right Now&#34; (5:32 minutes) - but the British album had been preceded by a truncated 7&#34; single in May 1970 with the instrumental &#34;Mouthful Of Grass&#34; from their 2nd album &#34;Free&#34; as its B-side (superb two-sider if ever there was one) - so they called it '(Long version)' on the original Island LP sleeves so that fans would know there was a difference between the LP cut and the 45.<br /><br />It opens with &#34;Fire And Water&#34; where the elements have apparently '...made you their daughter...' and immediately you're struck by the power of the band. The remaster is fantastic – FREE in your living room – drums and guitars - all hairy and wearing unbuttoned shirts as they leer at your worryingly interested underage daughter. The surprisingly lovely &#34;Oh I Wept&#34; feels incredibly clean - that strummed guitar and gently patted high-hat followed by Fraser's clear-as-a-bell Bass - a wonderful job done. &#34;Remember&#34; still has that slightly odd guitar arrangement with the riff upfront and the licks in the background - it's clearer as Rodgers sings '...wish I had you near me...' like he's already pining for a less cluttered life. &#34;Heavy Load&#34; closes Side 1 on an 'ancient song' where the Piano features strongly - adding a Soulfulness to Free's brand of 'rawk'.<br /><br />Side 2 is perfection to me - only three tracks - but each an absolute balls-to-the-wall winner. &#34;Mr. Big&#34; has Rodgers warning a potential suitor of his girl to watch out no matter what his connections are. The thud of that opening Drum followed by superb Kossoff Guitar and Fraser's wickedly effective Bass run make &#34;Mr. Big&#34; feel the single that should have followed &#34;All Right Now&#34;. The Bass is incredible in the Remaster - dominating your speaker cones throughout even as Kossoff sails off into that drawn-notes solo before the big chiming build-up. Surely they're best ballad - &#34;Don't Say You Love Me&#34; is unfortunately still smitten with heavy amounts of tape hiss which I noticed was dampened for the 2008 version. Here its way more obvious but does sound warmer as the band kicks in around 1:30 minutes. And what can you say about their signature song &#34;All Right Now&#34; - it comes roaring out of your speakers here like it was recorded yesterday and not 46 years ago. This transfer alone should sooth the savage naysayers - well done Remaster boys...<br /><br />Across the seven new 2016 reissues we probably loose thirty to thirty-five genuinely cool bonus tracks of old and all that enlightening info in the booklets too - so buying their catalogue yet again may become a chore for some fans. But they’re cheap at a fiver and we do gain fabulous new audio - and for many that's probably going to be the deciding factor.<br /><br />&#34;Fire And Water&#34; is back with a bang - and how good is it to hear FREE sound so awesome again after all these decades...<br /><br />PS: FREE titles in the 9 Sept 2016 Island Remasters CD Reissue Series are:<br />1.

B000SOQDNQ|5.0|Nick has created diverse characters that captivate you from the first word. He manages to speak extremely eloquently in their unique voices.     Jess is my all time favorite with her surprisingly perceptive observations & wit which she pits against Martin in the funniest sparring matches & one-liners that will have you laughing out loud!    Incredibly insightful prose on a very bleak topic but if ever there is a reason to 'keep going another 90days'  it is to be able to read books like this that turn things on their head & makes sense of the messy world we live in. Well done Nick - can't wait to read the restof your books :)
B0013D8LOU|5.0|This movie is breathing  in a gothic way. First of all I gave this movie five stars because the art of the film is amazing. The colors are amazing. I was glad the blood looked more like art and I am not one for bloody movies so with the blood looking the way it did I would be able to watch it again. Buy the 2 disk special edition it's the best. For a lot of singing you don't really pay attention to the singing much, the singing is what makes the movie but everything flows good. I am not a fan of singing movies but with this movie you don't seem to mind it a whole lot. I am glad I bought it a good cup of tea.
B000OV170W|5.0|Picoult offers a heart wrenching story with this novel. My Sister's Keeper is a story about two sisters: Anna, a healthy thirteen year old, and Kate a sixteen year old diagnosed with leukemia. The healthy sister was conceived by her parent who chose a specific embryo with the same blood characteristics as her older, sicker sister to provide umbilical chord blood to heal her sister. Unfortunately the procedure did not fully stop the disease and Anna's parents continued to use Anna as a donor of red blood cells, plasma, and bone marrow. When one of Kate's kidneys fail and Anna's parents want her to donate a kidney, she seeks medical emancipation from her parents with the help of a lawyer and case worker. The story is told by several different perspectives including Anna, Kate, their mother (a former lawyer), their father (a firefighter), Anna's lawyer, the case worker (who has a romantic history with the lawyer), and Jesse Anna and Kate's older brother. There are several underlying conflicts including the past of the lawyer and case worker, and Jesse's obsession with starting fires and his father's job. Most readers begin sympathizing with Kate and her disease but slowly start supporting Anna as flashbacks slowly through the back story as takes the reader through her pain and almost invisibility to the rest of her family accept when she is needed to donate.  This journey ends with a surprise ending that will leave everyone shocked. Picoult's books all explore several taboo subjects such as teen suicide (The Pact), rape (The Tenth Circle; Salem Falls), infant murder (Plain Truth), and child molestation (Perfect Match). Though Jodi Picoult's fiction is considered to be in the genre \\"chick lit\\", My Sister's Keeper is a good read for anyone.
1400063515|5.0|This is an eye-opening, sometimes jaw-dropping, intelligent and whitty book giving you a refreshing view of the world and life.  It's thought provoking and may very well change the way you view life.  A must read!<br />Ferd moved to Colorado.
B0013D8LOK|2.0|After wasting what seems like a lot of time watching this flick I am seriously wondering if:    - Is this a movie that Burton HAD to do because of a contract?  - What was the bad story about?  - Why did I buy it?    I have been a huge fan of Tim Burton for years, but this movie has NOTHING original in it.    The story is shallow, the musical part is weak, there is way too much blood....
B00005JLWN|4.0|This movie has been likened to the Matrix. A few similarities can be seen between the movies such as themes and action involved. But that's about as far as it goes.    Equilibrium was all about realistic looking action choreography. To be honest this film has some of the best choreographed gun fights I have ever seen. And to my surprise and pleasure it puts anything in The Matrix Trilogy to shame.    Christian Bale is one of the actors that keeps getting better and better in the movies I see him in and I am turning into a fan boy of sorts.    In this movie Bale portrays a Paladin, the best of the best. Paladins are masters in the art of the Gun-Kata, a form of martial arts in which the user becomes one with his weapons and can statistically predict the trajectories and angles of return fire to maximize survivability and killing. Bale's character lives in a post WWIII society that has put a ban on emotions all emotions and a drug has been introduced to supress all emotions. Bale is void of all emotion as well and he is sent out to to remove all \\"sense offenders\\" or people who have emotions because they refused to take the drug. After missing a dose of his medication he realizes what he missed out on and begins to change his ways.    Equilibrium delivers. That's all I have to say. If you want to see a quality movie check this one out.

B000GG4Y32|5.0|\\"Reds\\" is a film rarity as an historical, non-documentary film about real characters (e.g., Jack Reed) and real events that includes interviews with people who actually knew the principal characters involved. This film was nominated for 12 Oscars, including Best Picture, but won only one (Warren Beatty, Director), I suspect as much for political reasons as anything else.  I had been waiting YEARS for this to come out on DVD, or even to just be re-released on VHS.  The DVD looks excellent, and sounds great as well. We have loaned it out to friends who had never seen the film before, and they have come back praising it.  Enough said.

B000I2J6K0|4.0|I bought this video, a little dubious about what a pregnancy workout would entail. I found it to be incredibly helpful! Though the quality of the video has a very \\"at home\\" feel, Erin has a full workout with a quick pace that will keep you working. I didn't feel like it was too strenuous, and there is lots of time for stretching and relaxing.   The feel of the video is very laid back. Erin is in her home working out. There are many humorous moments, like when she has to go to the restroom in the middle of the workout. (It's also nice to have a pregnancy video led by someone pregnant.) I would recommend this video to anyone who wanted to stay in shape during their pregnancy.
0452289963|1.0|This book is blatant Hinduism. Eckert Tolle twists Bible verses to suit his own purposes. We can never become better people without the indwelling Holy Spirit, which we can only receive if we ask Jesus Christ into our hearts and repent of our sin. Read the Bible with an open mind. If it doesn't make sense to you, ask God for insight. The Bible is the Living Word of God. Everything else is just fluff.
0689865384|5.0|In today's modern society, everyone wants to be pretty. But in this book, becoming pretty comes with a price. In the book Uglies, Westerfeld's first book in his awesome trilogy, we discover a very possible future where everyone can possess stunning beauty when they turn sixteen. Everyone else is ugly. The story's main character is Tally, a girl who lives in the future and wants to be pretty more than anything. In order to be pretty, Tally has to betray her friend or forever stay ugly. Tally finds herself in this novel and what she what she really wants.   I personally loved this eye-opening novel. It has a plot that is well-constructed and keeps you hungry for more. Westerfeld satisfies this hunger, seeing as to he has a trilogy to Uglies. It also has a message that everyone can relate to: True beauty lies within. Uglies is a book that I would recommend to anyone who enjoys stories that open the mind and leave you thinking at the end. I would give this awesome book a rating of 5 stars.

B00025ETIW|5.0|I bought this album when it first came out, after hearing their first one, \\"I Brought You My Bullet\\", and I was blown away by this one. This is definitely one of those albums that you can throw in the player and leave it on. Forever. You don't have to skip through any songs. Each one has a completely different sound and vibe. This album is amazing...
B0014DBZY2|5.0|Here's a minor prediction for the musical year -- the Foals just might be the Next Really Big Thing in indie-rock.<br /><br />Yeah, someone says that about a fledgling band every year, sometimes more than once. But this little Oxford band has what it takes, and \\"Antidotes\\" is a gloriously energetic debut album -- mellow, bright rock'n'roll that makes you dance and bounce, yet has some postrock spaciness, nimble electronics and clever funky twists to keep things interesting. And it actually gets better as it goes on.<br /><br />It opens on a relatively simple note -- \\"The French Open,\\" an jazzy-funky little pop intro that periodically erupts into solid dancy rock. \\"Un peu d'air sur la terre/D'air sur la/D'air sur la/D'air sur la terre!\\"<br /><br />With that as the intro, they leap wholeheartedly into the cocky, rollicking \\"Cassius,\\" with its muscular riffs and confusingly jabby lyrics (\\"Cassius, it's over! You're second best!\\"). And with \\"Red Sock Pugie,\\" we get another catchy indie-rock melody -- but wrapped in a shimmering post-rock blanket, riddled with kettle drums.<br /><br />And most of the songs that follow linger somewhere between those two styles -- ringing circling pop with convulsing violins, moody rock tunes, fast funky dance music, fast-moving spacey tunes with airy fantastical lyrics, and a shimmering pop anthem in \\"Big Big Love (Fig. 2).\\"<br /><br />The Foals seem to wind down the album with the catchy \\"Like Swimming,\\" a little instrumental that sounds like eavesdropping on a tropical pool party. Then they yank you back up for the final song \\"Tron,\\" a dark little rocker with tight, muscular instrumentation and chirruping guitars.<br /><br />The Foals don't seem satisfied just by making music that makes you dance -- they seem to be striving for something cool yet fun, clever yet not pretentious. And they apparently want a mishmash style -- if you listen carefully, the indie-rock sound is infused with elements of funk, dance, and shimmering hazy spaciness. All this, and it's fun too.<br /><br />Part of what makes their music so appealing is the versatility -- we've got powerful bouncy riffs, undercurrents of grainy bass, and solid, hollow-sounding drums keeping the music energetic. But they can also make those instruments do some very odd things -- their guitars alone are a sonic circus, chirping or creaking or spiraling around in glittering loops.<br /><br />And then you get the really out-there stuff -- blares of Afrobeat brass, the occasional kettle drums, shimmers of keyboard, and some pedal guita to, as it's been reported around the Web, \\"mimic the sound of the solar system.\\" I don't really know what a solar system sounds like, but I presume that's the gloriously spacey, shimmery sound that wafts through most of these songs.<br /><br />Yannis Philippakis always sounds like he's about to run out of breath, but his flexible voice has enough energy to keep up with the music. And for a beginner band, the Foals have a knack for lyrics, filled with \\"butcher birds,\\" falling towers, nameless fuels, exploding hearts, and eating clouds to pass the time when you're not fighting vampires. Isn't that great?<br /><br />The Foals at first sound like just another art-rock band, but these guys have a special knack for effortlessly mixing elaborate cross-genre indie-rock with energetic dance. Keep an eye on these lads.akes their music so appealing is the versatility -- we've got powerful bouncy riffs, undercurrents of grainy bass, and solid, hollow-sounding drums keeping the music energetic.

B0012GVKVY|5.0|This Movie Rocks!!!       I, Robot is an awsome movie. It's a Thriller for all ages. The main character, Detective Spooner, ( Will Smith ), goes on what seems to be a hunt to find a bad robot. In this movie robots are programmed with three laws: 1.) A robot can not harm a human. 2.) A robot has to obey any direct order given by a human unless it interacts with the first law. 3.) A robot has a right to defend itself unless it interacts with the first or second laws.       Then the U-S-R goes and comes out with a new robot the NS-5. Then you can guess what happens, the robots try to take over the world with their leader V-I-K-I. Can Detective Spooner save the world along with Sonny the robot with feelings?  I guess the moral of the story would be that some rules are made to be broken but not all of them.
B000XPU5NY|5.0|I have every Genesis cd ever made including all the live versions and after seeing this concert in 2007, this cd is excellent in the songs they picked to put on the cd,as well as the quality. I just wished they used a diffferent title so they could have included some songs from the U.S. tour as well.(Genesis live 2007 tour) 5 stars for any Genesis fan....
B00005JNS0|4.0|The Movie CARS  I like the movie because it is funny and I like the fast cars, the pimped out cars I like are DJ, Boost, Snot rode, and Wingo. The funny cars I like are Mater because of all the stuff he says like when he is saying his name he says \\"my name is mater like Tamater but without the Ta\\". If Lightning would of got tires he would of won and would be the first ever rookie to win the Piston cup But when he's on the last turn he blows two tires. Then no one knows how won. And the King goes up to Lightning and said \\"he's a gutsy racer but you're stupid\\". Then the King says \\"get you a good crew chief and then you will be good\\". And then they say for the first time ever lightning says a rookie has won then he jumps through the paper. Then the announcer says there is a three way tie then on the way to California. DJ, WINGO, SNOT ROD, and BOOST started pushing Mac and Lightning falls out of the back of the truck. And he ends up in Radiator Springs. He was speeding and the Sheriff was going so fast Lightning thought that the Sheriff was shooting at him. So Lightning started going faster and when he got into the town he tour up the rode. So he had to fix the road with Beshy. And mater said \\"I would give two lug nuts to be with Beshy. Then he went really fast and the road was a lot worse so he had to do it again and that time he finished it. Then he found out that the judge was the Hudson Hornet. And then he tells Mater that he won 4 Piston cups and then Mater says \\"he did what in his cup\\". Lightning makes the Hudson Hornet mad so he calls somebody and tells him where Lightning is. So he was racing and was losing bad but then he hears all the people from Radiator Springs. And then he starts to win and Chick makes The King crash so lightning goes and helps The King cross the finish line. Then the Dinoco  manger over and asks Lightning if he wants anything and he says yes and Mater gets to ride in a helicopter and Radiator springs is put back on the map. Its one of my favorite shows and I think other people my like it to so watch it.
B00003CXRM|5.0|I'm reading some of the negative reviews of this film, and laughing so hard my stomach hurts!! Can you all say \\"clueless\\" boys and girls? Those who did not enjoy this film have no idea what film was made for over a hundred years ago!     This one shines brightly as the perfect epitome of cinematic experience. Enough can never be said for the genius of the Coen brothers concerning this masterpiece, based on Homer's 'The Odyssey\\". This will always set an example and become a classic for movie makers to learn from for decades, perhaps centuries to come!    George Clooney sets himself apart from every other role he's ever played, and should have walked home with an Oscar for his hilarious portrayal of the perfect backwards southern gentleman and leader of the fictional Soggy Bottom Boys...\\"Believe me Delmar, woman is the most fiendish instrument of torture ever devised to bedevil the days of man!\\" John Turturro, \\"Do not seek the treasure!!\\", also rounds out the \\"three stooges\\" group with a magnificent performance with Tim Blake Nelson...\\"We thought you was a toad!\\" John Goodman is perfect as the 'cyclops' personae of Homer's vision.    And then there is the soundtrack! As the 'angels' walk through the woods singing \\"Down In The River To Pray\\", you can actually feel the same awe and astonishment the Boys are feeling. You almost buy the fact that Clooney's lip-synch to \\"Man Of Constant Sorrow\\" is really his own voice, which only adds to the charm of the performance.    Like I said, 5 stars and 2 thumbs up aren't enough for this one! Those of you who didn't understand this film are just as hilarious as the movie itself. Clooney's 'Ulysses Everett' said it best...\\"I swear you boys are dumber than a bag of hammers!\\"     Homer would be proud!
1416550518|5.0|Grace, nearing her centenary, meets a young woman who is making a movie about a place and time that Grace knew as a housemaid at the beginning of the 20th century. She is moved to record her recollections of that time for her grandson. As she tells the story, her past and the present and even the future of the characters intertwine to make a masterful and satisfying story.<br />This book is beautifully written without feeling self-consciously literary. It has love, death, birth, history, crime, politics, tragedy, and surprises. The characters are well-drawn, and you cannot help but care about them, and about the twists and turns their lives take.<br />The book is also evocative of a time, the period of enormous change in the lives of English people of all social strata. The first World War, the fall of the great country houses, the emancipation of women -- these events become characters in the story.<br />In two stories, really: the one that took place at Riverton so many years before this one began, and the one that takes place so neatly as the story progresses that its promise of happy endings comforts the reader for the tragic ending of the first.<br />The reader will remember these characters, and feel richer for having known them.
0151013837|5.0|A rather outre plot but one beautifully rendered. A boy (Pi) grows up in a zoo (which his father owns)which makes him familiar with wild beasts. It is a familiarity he will need as, on the family's way to Canada, together with many zoo animals, their ship sinks and Pi (alone) finds himself on a lifeboat staring out onto a great expanse of blue sky and green sea. Others find their way to the same lifeboat, all animals, one of which is a great Tiger. Surely death must come to Pi.    The illustrations do enhance the wonderful writing and I would suggest buying the illustrated version.

B00132D808|5.0|Nothing like A Fever You Can't Sweat Out but fantastic just the same. To be honest I didn't even start listening to that first CD until I heard this one. I think Pretty. Odd. is a great and sweetly odd CD. I guess its not for the everyday emo fan but for anyone up for a little adventure its really fun.

It would truly be a pleasant surprise to see a series ended in the same professional style it started and ran with !!
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The great animated detail, and sweetest of stories put together with Pixar in a stunning feature film will certainly have you agreeing with me, that this is also your 'Newest favorite movie'!  I am not kidding you, I am a mature lady, but I have to admit, that I have had to buy this DVD, so I can re-watch it whenever I want to escape.<br />I have watched this film eight times.  WoW!  I hope you will....if you haven't already, rent this and see it for yourself.  It is great clean fun, and just enjoy it!  Thank you Pixar, this is your greatest yet!
0321544080|1.0|Save your money!! This is definitely not a \\"one foot in the classroom\\" type of book.  Quite honestly, I don't know what to make of it!!!  I was looking forward to getting it from Amazon as I had read quite a few very positive reviews of the book. Anyway, I start to read it.  Looked at some of the photos/snapshots.  I started to laugh!!  There is absolutely no rhyme or reason to this book.  It completely blew my mind!  Honestly, here are a few examples  of those \\"photography secrets: \\"This is a shot with available light-late afternoon, using a 20mm wide angle lens\\" (p.120)  Here's another \\"This shot was taken outdoors at dusk in Jaipu, India, during the Festival of Lights using available light.  It was taken with a 180mm lens at f2.8.  The soft glow through the veil was provided entirely by the candles\\" (p.88) Wow, thanks for those tips Joe.  And most don't even mention that much technical information.  Oh sure, there are some decent photos, and some good tips, but I was expecting a helluva lot more.  \\"Photography secrets from one of the world's top shooters\\"?????  Most of non-portrait/artificial lighting topics are common sense. The text consists of way too much dribble with little of the pertinent information which the book advertised.  Most importantly, if you are not a portrait photographer and do not do a lot of work with artificial lighting,  you could spend your money and time on something better.  I was actually thinking of returning this book to Amazon, but have decided to give it to a friend for his birthday.  He gave me a crappy gift for mine!!
B0007YJ3TI|1.0|This book was written based from research that was conducted through the usage of surveys that were taken in 1995. They basically accumulated information from 1000 american millionaires regarding their methods of house-hold finance, behavior, spending habits etc. Simply an analysis of the American millionaire demograhpic in the year 1995. No practical wisdom. Useless info in becoming wealthy.    The whole book could've been summed up to: \\"be modest, cheap, and save as much as possible\\".    IN CONCLUSION: If you're looking to learn to make more income, save your money and time, this one sucked. If you want a lesson in history, go right ahead.
B000G8NXYG|5.0|If you know about Kurosawa's Seven Samurai you're a fan of the movie. If you're a fan you probably already have the old Criterion release from the 1990s. If you're wondering about upgrading, the answer is, yes; yes, you should. Like you, I was disappointed in the quality of the print of the old Criterion - it certainly showed its age but I figured, hey, this is Criterion; it's got to be the best anybody can do for now. But I still mourned the defects in the scratchy print and yearned for a better one.     Well, the newest Criterion is not perfect but it stopped my yearning. It represents a huge step forward in quality - no longer do the visual defects (scratches, etc.) distract you, placing a filter between you and the movie. Even lacking perfection it represents an obvious leap forward in quality, and any further improvements will just be icing on the cake. If you're a fan, buy it. If the price makes you think twice, rent it, but you'll still probably want a copy for your own.
0452287588|5.0|This book is really interesting.  The first chapter is a hard read, but the rest of the book is full of interesting ideas.  Have an open mind and get through the first chapter and you might find something you can appreciate.

B0013BNY2Q|5.0|This sounds like an R.E.M. IRS record.  Fast and happy instead of that slow and sappy junk they've been putting out over the past 10 years(?)  We don't want no \\"Everybody Hurts\\" crap.  We want \\"Hollow Man\\" type stuff.  The world needs more happy sounding music and that's what has returned.  Lyrics are not necessarily happy like the Springsteen \\"Magic\\" CD but the music is clever like Bruce's CD. Last few R.E.M. cd's MUSIC has been lame to me.  Their lyrics are never lacking.  Pilgrimage to your store and buy this for both the words and the melodies.  It's very good.

B00000AD94|5.0|By now anyone who is into modern progressive rock is familiar with Spock's Beard.  I remember first starting to hear about them after their performance at Progfest in Los Angeles.  The buzz about their show spread all over the Internet and soon their album was appearing in many top 10 lists.  I picked up \\"The Light\\" at a CD store in Grand Rapids Michigan and have been a big fan of the band ever since.  I still think \\"The Light\\" may be the band's best album.  It is not like Spock's Beard were spring chickens at this point.  All of the band members had been around the music biz for many years in various incarnations of other people's projects.  When these 5 guys finally got it together something magic happened that separated them from the prog heap that was emerging in the late 90's.  I still love this album and think it ranks up with all of the band's later stuff.  The music is pure Spock's Beard with lots of quirky time changes and signature weirdness that takes the best of classic progressive rock into the modern era.  Some people hate the albums lyrics, but I have always liked the way Neal Morse turns a phrase.  At some point in the late 90's Morse became a born again Christian which would increasingly find it's way into Spock's Beard's lyrics, but \\"The Light\\" was recorded prior to that event with lyrics that are raw even containing some expletives.  For me the 23 minute \\"The Water\\" is the highlight of the album and indeed one of my all time favorite Spock's tracks.    I love the different styles incorporated into this track from raw hard rock, to classic progressive to Eagles like country rock.  It is all here.  The rest of the album \\"The Light\\", \\"Go The Way You Go\\", and \\"On The Edge\\" have all become Spock's classics as well.  I enjoy this album from beginning to end.  It gets mixed reviews from progressive rock fans, but for me this is what good prog is all about.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I wished i'd have known about this show before it went off-air. My dad had the series and the Serenity movie I watched both and wish there was more. I wasn't sure i'd like the show but i'd heard about the movie so i decided to give the show a try. I really enjoyed it. I think those zombie things are freaky but they never really show much gore. I like all the characters each is very different. I thought the westerness of it was a nice suprise. I liked the people more in the show than in the movie because i got to know them more.I wish they could continue the show right where they left off. Stop reading reviews and get this show even if your only a little interested because you won't regret it.

B000002U9W|5.0|This has been one of my favorite Floyd albums for many years.The title track is truly bizzare,smooth,funky,weird,and totally unlike anything else Floyd has done before or since.There are three songs written individually by the members.If,Summer68 and Fat Old Sun.These three songs sound more traditional with Gilmour's Fat Old Sun being the best.The album ends with an interesting but forgetable instrumental.This album is all about the title track for me and the rest is just an added bonus.
B0013FDM7E|4.0|Good, solid entertainment for the casual audiences. Will Smith is great as always, the set designs are pretty good too. The vampire like creatures look a little cartoonish, but overall this is a pretty good movie.
B000CZ0Q5W|4.0|This is one of Pat Metheny's best.  I have the original CD release and have used it as a reference when auditioning audio equipment.  The original recording really is great.  So what could the studio possibly do to improve it when remastering?    Apparently the studio thought that it was important that this recording sound good when listening to it in the car, because they boosted the average sound level by compressing the loud parts.  Sure, when comparing the two versions with the volume knob at the same setting, the quiet parts of the remastered version sound clearer and more distinct.  But that's because the quiet parts are louder.  Unfortunately for the remastering engineer it's not possible to make the louder parts louder, too.  The result is the loss of dynamic range, and occasional clipping.  5 of the 7 tracks hit the maximum level on the remastered CD.  Only 1 does on the original.    So what about those quiet parts where the remastered version seems to sound clearer?  When the volume level is compensated for the difference in average levels, the original sounds almost identical to the remastered version in those quiet parts.  Too bad -- the original is just as clear as the remastered version and has greater dynamics.  If you want compression, a lot of consumer playback equipment has a compression circuit, often called \\"loudness\\".  That will make the quiet parts louder so just about everything is the same volume, which should be great for listening in your car.    I'll be keeping the original and flipping the remastered version.
B00133KFGW|2.0|Are you serious!!!.. This movie is absolutly pathetic. It takes every possible impossible circumstance and makes it happen. I'm ready to scream to viewers.... DO NOT WASTE YOUR $$$ AND TIME WATCHING THIS.<br />My wife liked the movie, but she's the one that likes all the sappy heartwarmers. I found this movie unbelievable. It reminded me of all those movies with computer scenes from the 80s like Weird Science where the character create a beutiful women just feeding the computer with pictures from different magazines. I suppose was interesting for those who knew nothing about computers in those days, like me.<br />Now, back to the movie, perhaps the most shocking part of this film was that Robin Williams plays the villain? Come on!..give me a break!..is actually difficult to hate this guy, is like Pee Wee Herman playing the role of a serial killer?<br />Anyhow, no one I know can learn the guitar in less than a minute and be enrolled in the Juilliard School in practically the same amount of time. You can not play a guitar by just slapping it. Not only that, but playing the organ the way he does the first time? give me another break! The kid also doesn't know how to conduct an orchestra.<br />Taking the movie for what it is, it will leave you with a warmed heart, and a new awareness of the music all around you.<br />Two out of five stars for Freddie's good job as a young actor, other than that everything was fairly disappointing. Most of the movie is pretty good, but the end is totally unrealistic. These two lovers hadn't seen each other for 11 years, and when they do, they hold hands and smile at each other. Thats it?.. no \\"Oh my god I've finally found you!\\" or..\\"I missed you so much!\\"..or maybe at least a  \\"Oh hey, what's up?.\\" again, totally overrated. Don't waste your money, watch it when it's on TV and it's free. It's definately not worth your hard-earned cash.

1853260436|2.0|This is my first Austen novel, and I must say, I don't know what all the hype is about.  I thought it was excruciatingly slow at times, and then all of a sudden it was fast and over.  Some of the writing was beautiful and poetic, but that is like 5% of the book.  The other 95% of the book was pretty boring to me.  Maybe I am jaded by all the horror and mysteries I read where I am used to fast paced suspense, but seriously, I would read one chapter a day or maybe two with this book and that was all I could handle, because it would make me tired.  I felt no connection with the main character Catherine, and I found myself not caring what happened to her, good or bad.  I just wanted the book to be over.
B000WMEAKC|4.0|Timbaland obviously has a good ear for talented musicians today. We have all heard Apologise on our radios and know the pure beauty of the breathy vocals that are gracing the airwaves.<br /><br />Don't make the mistake of thinking that One Republic are destined to be a one hit wonder. Their album Dreaming Out Loud is full of the same sweet melodies and tasteful lyrics as Apologise. With smooth production and intelligent tastes, they have triumphed with their debut album - it's well worth a listen.<br /><br />With singer Ryan Tedder following in the breathy vocal stylings of Chris Martin of Coldplay fame, the band following the musical essence of acts like Snow Patrol and the industry smarts of their mentor Timbaland, it will be hard for them to go too wrong.<br /><br />Dreaming Out Loud plays very nicely at a dinner party or when just reclining back with a nice red and good book. The sounds are anything but obnoxious. They can, at times, disappear and play unnoticed if you are not consciously listening directly it. When it comes to relaxing background music, this one is a perfect choice.<br /><br />The album has both the original and Timbaland versions of Apologise. The magic doesn't end there - Stop And Stare, Say and the title track Dreaming Out Loud are all stand out tracks.<br /><br />If you're hesitant to put this one on your `to buy' list, at least put it on your `to listen' list.
B00005JPNY|1.0|I have read the complete series of His Dark Materials books, including the Golden Compass. I was very excited to see this film when it came out in theaters, and even though I knew they would make the book into a children's movie - the movie was horribly disappointing. If you have read the book, you will NOT want to buy this movie.<br /><br />The movie is jumbled, includes characters that don't show up until later books, characters are not developed, the sequence of events is mixed up, and it's only an hour and 45 minutes.<br /><br />I was extremely disappointed in this film.
B0013BNY2Q|2.0|I loved REM when they first came out. I had all their first albums, CD's. They sounded fresh, had good melodies and their music really moved. The last few CD's they made I thought were boring. This one had one good song - Supernatural Superserious. The other songs, are nice, but I wouldn't buy them, for I would never listen to them again. They just don't do anything interesting anymore.
0743454537|5.0|Wow! Loved this so much, goes from each character's point of view which I really liked.  It is very tear jerking (actually more like tears already falling out of my eyes!).  It is basicly about this girl named Anna who was pretty much born to save her sister, Kate, who has leukemia.  But Anna is tired of giving blood and this and that and whatever Kate needs without anyone asking her whether she wants to do it.  I really don't think I will tell you want she does...unless you really want to know.  Here I'll tell you but if you haven't read it and want to wait and see don't read this, I'm just warning you now!  She decides to sue her parents.  But anyway one of my FAVORITE books.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|We have all likely done the same thing. After watching a television infomercial about how easy it might be to complete a certain task thanks to a miracle invention, many of us perhaps call the toll free number, hand over our credit card information and are then on are way to dicing and slicing with the newest and sharpest steak knives out there. There is just something about those mysterious salesmen on television that we simply cannot get enough of and as a society we become lemmings to the messages for the products they sell.<br /><br />When Remy overheard one such advertisement for a book named Anyone Can Cook written by famed French chef Gusteau (voice by Brad Garrett), Remy decided that it was time for him to make a life for himself and follow the footsteps of his television mentor, Gusteau. Remy already had a flawless appreciation of both the tastes and smells of good food and it would be a natural progression for such a food critic and aficionado to move into the kitchen. There was just one thing holding Remy back: he is a rat.<br /><br />In Ratatouille , a story of an amazing rat that seeks not the human scraps and waste that so many other rats crave but instead wants to find the sharpest of cheese and the finest of fruits. Remy (voice by Patton Oswalt) is not your typical, everyday rat that wants to hang out in the sewers, rather, he wants to hang out in the kitchen of a fine French restaurant.<br /><br />Remy befriends a young and awkward man by the name of Linguini (voice by Lou Romano). When Gusteau's restaurant is being run by Skinner (voice by Ian Holme) after the passing away of restaurant great Gusteau, Linguini who is merely a dishwasher and floor sweeper at the restaurant out of pre-death wish of Gusteau, magically concocts a soup dish that the entire dining room simply goes crazy for. Of course, Linguini can thank much of his success to a \\"little chef\\" that helps him out along the way.<br /><br />The success that Linguini has stumbled upon thanks to the help of the \\"little chef\\" then sets off a battle between he and Skinner and in fact due to some legal issues, as well, the battle becomes further complicated. Though Skinner perhaps has visions of grandeur for the Gusteau brand and wishes to enter the microwave burrito market (amongst other things) it is in fact Linguini that restores the fame that the Gusteau name carried for so long.<br /><br />Written by Brad Bird and Jan Pinkman, Ratatouille is an amazingly well done animated film and there are certainly times that as an adult you almost forget that you are watching a children's movie. The story line of the film is creative and fun and there was never a time throughout the film that the viewer could become bored with what is going on.<br /><br />Ratatouille was nominated and ended up winning the 2008 Oscar for Best Animated Feature of the Year and it is no surprise as to why this is the case. The movie is an amazingly well done animated work that is both fun to watch and impressive to view in terms of the effort paid to detail that is evidenced by this film.<br /><br />This film would be the ideal family movie night film as it certainly would appeal to all members of the family, young and old. As with most Disney-Pixar films, the film seemed to be flawless in terms of production and the animation itself was nothing but top notch.<br /><br />Even if you are scared of rats, Ratatouille provides the viewer with a great film that shows perhaps a more likable and lovable side of rats that we perhaps have never experienced before. And from now on if I ever see an actual rat having a piece of gruyere matched nicely with a cabernet sauvignon , it will be hard not to think about the amazing things that this creature might be able to concoct in the kitchen if he is only given the chance.\\" then sets off a battle between he and Skinner and in fact due to some legal issues, as well, the battle becomes further complicated.

0143038419|4.0|This was an enjoyable book about a young woman trying to find herself while traveling to several countries over the course of one year.  There were many interesting tidbits of information about each country visited.
B000002UAX|5.0|Released forty years ago, \\"The Beatles\\" aka \\"The White Album\\" is notable for many reasons. It's the Fab Four's only double album. It differs greatly from the band's previous two psychedelic albums for a more back-to-basics approach which would continue with their following albums. It's a sprawling and at times schizophrenic record that documents the falling apart of the band as most songs are primarily composed by whomever is singing the lead with the rest of the boys as backup band. Though this is true going back to about \\"Beatles For Sale\\", it especially applies to this album as Ringo briefly quit for a while with Paul playing drums on \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\" and a few other songs; Yoko Ono's presence in the studio which irritated everyone with the exception of John; and other personal events that had the band unraveling.<br /> Kicking things off to a rousing start is \\"Back In The U.S.S.R.\\", an inspired mixture of Chuck Berry and The Beach Boys. Sung by Paul with wonderful backup singing by John & George, it has a great melody and witty tongue-in-cheek lyrics. John's \\"Dear Prudence\\" with a sweet, cascading guitar line the boys became known for follows. This song was inspired by Mia Farrow whom they met during their stay in India for the purpose of studying meditation with Maharashi Mahesh Yogi. Next up is the lyrically self-referential \\"Glass Onion\\", another brilliant song by John. For me, the pseudo-reggae of Paul's \\"Ob-La-Di, Ob-La-Da\\" is cute but ultimately somewhat forgettable. It's another of the Beatles' children's songs in the tradition of \\"Yellow Submarine\\". \\"Wild Honey Pie\\" is another track that could easily have been left off the album, sounding totally like filler. John's \\"The Continuing Story Of Bungalow Bill\\" is mainly notable for its satiric lyrics and Yoko's unique backup singing. Its melody is especially weak when compared to George's stately, lovely \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" which follows. Graced with guitar solos by George's pal Eric Clapton, this song firmly establishes Mr. Harrison as a songwriter on par with Lennon & McCartney. \\"Guitar\\" also utilizes that trademark cascading guitar figure that bonds the verses with the choruses. This song is beautifully straight forward, abandoning the psychedelia (which I nonetheless adored) of compositions like \\"Within You Without You\\" from \\"Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" from \\"Magical Mystery Tour\\". \\"Happiness Is A Warm Gun\\" is a song in three parts and the second song from this album in which John mentions guns. Spooky. In light of his tragic assassination in 1980, was this guy psychic? The verses on this one are a bit folk, the bridge is bluesy and the chorus is inspired by doo-wop. Again, the lyrics are delightfully tongue-in-cheek. Paul's \\"Martha My Dear\\" is a great little number that was inspired by his dog. John follows this with another bluesy tune, \\"I'm So Tired\\". Paul's sublime \\"Blackbird\\" was inspired by the American Civil Rights movement. It's just Paul, an acoustic guitar and birdsong and it's absolutely lovely in its simplicity. George's \\"Piggies\\" is another satire, this time concerning class differences. The first reference to Bob Dylan on \\"The Beatles\\" is \\"Rocky Raccoon\\" with Paul emulating the American poet in the lyrics and general form and tone of the song. Ringo makes his writing debut with the country song \\"Don't Pass Me By\\". The lyrics are dryly funny but like the songs that immediately precede and follow it (Paul's \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\"), the tunes sound a bit tossed off, a bit throwaway. \\"I Will\\" is another very pretty song by Paul that is instrumentally minimalist with just acoustic and bass guitar. Disc 1 ends with John's ode to his mother, the delicate acoustic guitar ballad \\"Julia\\". It's a very touching song and its simplicity, it mirrors \\"I Will\\" perfectly.<br /><br /> Disc 2 opens with the rocking \\"Birthday\\" which is followed by John's \\"Yer Blues\\", a tortured blues number that references \\"Ballad OfA Thin Man\\" with the line 'just like Dylan's Mr. Jones'. Paul's gorgeous \\"Mother Nature's Son\\" is next. Largely acoustic, it also features a lovely horn section. John brings back the rock 'n roll with \\"Everybody's Got Something To Hide Except Me And My Monkey\\" with its rollicking guitar bits. The piano-driven \\"Sexy Sadie\\" was written by John about the boys' fallout with the Maharishi. Lovely background vocals enhance an already terrific song. \\"Helter Skelter\\" proves that although best known for his beautiful ballads, Paul could rock like a hell-hound. 'Blisters on my fingers', indeed. Did he invent heavy metal with this song? I believe it predates Black Sabbath's debut album by a couple of years! George's \\"Long,Long,Long\\" makes a 360 degree turn from the heavy rock of \\"Helter Skelter\\". Anchored by organ, this song is a sublime marvel. The shift in tone, like so many from this album, is what gives \\"The Beatles\\" the schizophrenic feel I noted earlier. The version of \\"Revolution 1\\" on this album is quite different than the single version. Its focus is more acoustic and again owes a debt to doo-wop. I don't share Paul's love of the music hall/vaudeville genre but if you're curious about it, the second (!) \\"Honey Pie\\" is a great example of it. George's tribute to sweets, \\"Savoy Truffle\\" follows. It's a nice little rocker with swinging horns. John's haunting, beautiful \\"Cry Baby Cry\\" precedes the Beatles' most experimental track, \\"Revolution 9\\", which was constructed from various tapes John made. His association with avant-garde artist Ono becomes crystal clear after a listen to this mind-blowing 'song'. Paul & George had enjoyed making tracks out of tapes going back to \\"Pepper's\\" at least but had never released them under the Beatles name. It has enormously influenced my own music. If you enjoy \\"Revolution 9\\" then check out the works of Karlheinz Stockhausen, one of the original practitioners of musique concrete. \\"The Beatles\\" fittingly closes with \\"Good Night\\", a wonderfully wistful tune perfectly sung by Ringo.<br /> Needless to say and despite its flaws, \\"The Beatles\\" is an essential part of this amazing band's catalog.

B000068FXX|5.0|Supertramp is basically a band that likes to focus their music on writing excellent songs, sort of like Elton John or Billy Joel.  Supertramp's style, however, is more laid back and they like to extend their songs a bit further than most.  As a songwriting band, they're pretty good at what they do, and I recommend this album in particular for its overall consistency and enjoyable value.  \\"Fool's Overture\\" steps away from the other songs with its big, bombastic style, and it's over 10 minutes of memorable music.
B00008NRI8|5.0|Take an actor that's good at playing the self centered womanizer; take an actress who's good at playing the lonely tomboy; give them a script that utilizes their strengths and pairs it with witty and fresh dialog and what do you have?  I'll tell you what you have; you have one extremely funny, and rewarding, cinematic experience.  `Two Weeks Notice' does just that.  It pairs the very `British' Hugh Grant with everyone's favorite `train wreck' Sandra Bullock and it allows the two of them to play off one another brilliantly.<br /><br />Sandra Bullock has been quoted as saying that she is in no hurry to film another romantic comedy because she has already filmed the perfect one; `Two Weeks Notice'.  I have to agree (although I thought `While You Were Sleeping' was equally `perfect') for this film is hilarious from start to finish.<br /><br />The film follows Lucy Kelson, a lawyer who makes it a practice of fighting against large corporations who are bent on tearing down the community to make profit.  One such corporation is Wade Industries.  When she accosts Wade's posterboy George Wade she finds herself being offered a job.  If she takes the job then her precious community center will be spared.  She agrees and thus starts the crazy relationship between employer and employee.  Lucy soon discovers that working for George is a fulltime job; as in 24-7.  When Lucy decides she has had enough she gives George her two-week notice; but quitting Wade proves to be more difficult then Lucy expected.<br /><br />Like I mentioned, Sandra and Hugh play off one another magnificently.  Their humor matches the other beautifully and lends itself to some magical comedic moments.  This is one of those pairings that makes complete and total sense; one you wish they would revisit very soon.  While Lucy and George are nothing new to Bullock and Grant respectively, the characters seem fresh because they finally have a worthy partner.  Hugh Grant and Sandra Bullock compliment one another; they complete one another.<br /><br />The film also has some worthy supporting characters.  Dana Ivey and Robert Klein play Lucy's parents Ruth and Larry and play off one another wonderfully as well.  Larry is the concerned and affectionate confidant while Ruth is the challenging opinionated mother who sets expectations for her daughter to reach.  Heather Burns (who also stars alongside Bullock in the two `Miss Congeniality' films) plays Lucy's best friend Meryl and while she's not as memorable as she was in `Miss Congeniality' (that may be due to considerably less screen time) she still does a fine job.  Stealing the supporting brownie points is Alicia Witt (when is this girl going to get a gig that really emphasizes her talent?!?!) who just mesmerizes as June Carver, the lucky hopeful training to take over Lucy's job.<br /><br />In the end I must say once again that `Two Weeks Notice' is hysterical.  Sure, it is clich&eacute;d (but never to a fault) and it is predictable (but in a good way) but it is so genuinely charming and so well constructed that you can't help but enjoy it to the very last drop.  Bullock and Grant soar together.  Here's to hoping they team up for a sequel (or at least another film)..    The film also has some worthy supporting characters.

B0000025DR|4.0|ELO was a pretty consistent pop band in the 70's.  Sure, you either liked their style of including orchestration sounds into their music or you didn't.  They surely are more than just the \\"second wave of the Beatles\\" or whatever some people might say about them.  Or, maybe they did want to be like the Beatles with all their catchy pop songs.  Either way, what matters is what us, the listeners, think when we hear their music.  Know what I think?  They were very good at the pop rock formula.  They had a real talent for writing catchy vocal melodies, and an ability to throw in some emotion.    \\"Fire on High\\" is a loud, intense, and SUPER melodic instrumental.  I love the way the feelings shift around from upbeat and intense, to downright sad and lonely.  All these things happen in the music alone, with no vocals, and to me that's a really special feeling.  \\"Poker\\" is another amazing highlight with the super melodic vocals.  The two hit songs are worth hearing yet again, but NOT the best songs on the album.    \\"Waterfall\\" is another splendid surprise.  A classic album really.  Yeah, it's commercial sound probably rubs some people the wrong way, but to me it's alright.  What matters is that the album's filled with songs that catch my attention and keep my interest, and that's all I ask for out of a pop band.
0780619951|4.0|If you don't pick up the metaphors or hidden message throughout the movie, you will (and should) at the end of the movie.  Then, you'll be like \\"aha!\\"<br /><br />*The Island of Dr. Moreau* is a story about a mad scientist (Brando) converting animals into humans.  However, his experiments aren't perfect...yet.  (Well, except one...at least, on the outer appearance.)  These creatures reminds me of *The Fly*, caught between two species, more animal than human.  Therefore, these creatures must be regulated so that their animal instincts do not take over and create chaos.<br /><br />The problem is that when you have animals with human DNA/intelligence, they become a deadly combination.  Chaos is inevitable.  But who wins at the end?  These mutated creatures or the humans?<br /><br />The movie ends with a montage of riots, wars and other public disorders.  Wait a minute.  We're humans with animal behavior, attacking and clawing others.  You almost feel a slight tingling of shame when you see this montage.  So, are we not a deadly combination that cause nothing but chaos?  Are we to be controlled and regulated?<br /><br />Wonderful film for a deep discussion afterwards.
B000002U88|4.0|You know how many of the rock bands from the 70's had trouble finding an appropriate sound once the 80's rolled around?  You know, a sound that can make the band maintain their level of enjoyment while updating the sound of the 80's and still being *good*?  Bob Seger apparently didn't have any problem with the change, as many of the songs contain that same feeling of enjoyment that the previous Seger albums from the 70's did.  I really like the ballad \\"Comin' Home\\" a LOT.  It sounds so honest and meaningful, and Bob's vocals elevate the melody to new heights.  The album also has some good rockers too.  A comeback album worth owning.
0751504556|4.0|helped me quite a bit, but like anything i didn't agree with all or did not apply. still well worth the read and bunch of my friends want to borrow it, seeing the difference it made in me.
B000002U8U|4.0|This album features one of the GREATEST and prettiest songs Seger ever wrote- \\"Till it Shines\\".  THAT is a fantastic song!  In fact, this is one pretty solid album overall, with only the atrocious \\"Old Time Rock and Roll\\" doing a nice job irritating the heck out of me.  Seger sure had some brilliant songs, and I'm really happy this is yet another solid album.  Yes, it was one of his most popular albums, but you can't argue with the quality of the songwriting and Seger's excellent voice.  \\"Feel Like a Number\\" is another song worth hearing for its excellent vocals and rocking vibe, not to mention featuring lyrics I can relate to.
B00005JM0B|4.0|The Good Things<br />*Lots of great action and special effects.  It's hardly ever dull.<br />*Storyline relatively fits.<br />*Still lots of serious and lots of funny parts.<br />*Characters are not bad.<br />*The Terminatrix is an excellent enemy.  I like the fact that she combines the best of all previous terminators; it's a very systematic solution.<br />*Music is not bad.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Not as many memorable lines.<br />*Some things in the franchise have become convuluted.  This film introduced certain elements (like John Connor having a wife) that probably should have been left out.<br />*John Connor's character is weakened.  And now that I've seen \\"Carnivale,\\" I will probably always look at the actor Nick Stahl as a reluctant farm boy instead of the future leader of the resistance.<br /><br />I never expected this film to have any more action than T2, but I was ultimately surprised as to how much there was.  The first half had loads of great scenes, including one of the coolest car chases I've ever seen.  The Terminatrix impressed me as well.  The film had a fair amount of both drama and comedy.  Some parts remain ambiguous or convoluted, but still fits okay with the other films.  It's not perfect, but it is enjoyable, and for the movies, brings everything into a mostly-full circle.
0792844890|4.0|A parody of Star Wars, and Aliens, and some other films of the type (space science fiction) is of course welcome because we like taking things un-seriously, non-seriously, serious-ness-less-ly. So it is funny and that is not a surprise. Mel Brooks knows how to make things both funny and silly so that we can gargle with giggles and barf with laughter. But the film has the main defect all Mel Brooks's films have. The humor is essentially punctual, so we have one joke after another, one smile after another, one pleasant moment after another, but there is no structural derision of the models. The final birth of an alien is funny both because of the situation in which it happens and it surprises us then, and because the alien is turned into some kind of long-tailed Fred Astaire or Zizi Jeanmaire. With a few bananas it could have impersonated Josephine Baker. The River Kwai song is funny because it surprises us too especially since we were expecting seven dwarves and their song when going down to the mine. But that is all. Beyond this fun nothing, zilch. And that's a shame because the subject could have been a real mine of structural humor against these big space sagas that process the audience into some kind of slightly, and even at times a lot, intellectually and culturally retarded people. The only attempt at this structural humor is to make the king of the good ones regress beyond some kind of constitutional monarchy to look like an old feudal monarchy in the absurd way they dress, a King Lear comic clown. But that does not shoot the moon down from the sky. In the same way the transformation of the bad spaceship into the statue of Liberty is pure derision but the transformation of her beams of light around her head into escape routes that defecate the wrecked soldiers does not really provides the film with some structural meaning, like the satire of American democracy and liberty that are at times quite dark in their general functioning. Funny for sure in the absurd line of definition of this term, funny too when you can read most of the allusions, but the fun is scattered and sprinkled all over, as if the millions of stars could be compared to the unique and sole sun.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelinesine of definition of this term, funny too when you can read most of the allusions, but the fun is scattered and sprinkled all over, as if the millions of stars could be compared to the unique and sole sun.

B000ZN802W|5.0|When I saw this movie for the first time I knew nothing about it. I looked at the cover and thought it looked like a grown up version of \\"Alaska\\", which I loved as a kid. I had no idea what I was getting into. It was spectacular. The movie itself was beautiful and should be watched not only for it's thematic grandure but it's athstetic qualities as well. The end made me cry harder then I have since my grandmother died. This was the saddest and most beautiful movie I have ever seen. Then to discover it was based on actual events made it that much more powerful. Everyone should see this movie once.
B00008PC2O|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Tons of excellent action scenes, and lots of great special effects.<br />*Good filming style.  Not as fresh as the first \\"Terminator,\\" but still memorable.<br />*Good continuing story.  Much more complex than the first film.<br />*Stronger focus on the destructive nature of humanity.<br />*Great lines.<br />*Still good characters.  Still great acting.  In fact, the terminator is a stronger character in this one.<br />*Even though much of it is serious, there is also quite a bit of comedy throughout.  There is also less violence, making the film a little less stark or brutal.<br />*Good music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*Ummmm....<br /><br />While not as fresh, original, or serious as the first film, this sequel is just as essential.  The action and special effects are much more enjoyable.  The story and characters continue to be great, if not better.  On top of it all, it is as thought-provoking as the first, if not moreso.  Many people may say that sequels are all bad, but I always refer to this one as one shining example of how great a sequel can be.  Anybody who has seen the \\"Terminator\\" must see this one as well.
6305841861|5.0|Evil Dead II:Dead By Dawn is the 1987 sequel to the Evil Dead movie made in 1981. The film was directed by Sam Raimi. It starred Bruce Campbell & Sarah Berry. Often looked upon as a remake of the first film on a higher budget, it isn't and wasn't intended to be. The story goes a lil something like this: Ash and his girlfriend Linda take a romantic vacation to a seemingly abandoned cabin in the woods (which is all just basically a recap of the first film minus everyone else to catch viewers up with the plot). While in the cabin, Ash plays a tape of an archeology professor reciting passages from the Necronomicon(or \\"Book of the Dead\\"), which he has discovered during an archaeological dig(the professor, that is.). The recorded incantation unleashes an evil force that kills and possesses the body of Linda. Ash is forced to sacrifice his girlfriend. After he buries and dismembers his girlfriend, a spirit is seen on the hunt for Ash. It's there where the film picks up and continues. Alot of people don't know it but this movie might not have been made if it weren't for Author Stephen King. At the time, King was directing his first movie, Maximum Overdrive, based on his short story \\"Trucks\\". He had dinner with a crewmember who had been interviewed about the Evil Dead sequel, and the crewmember told King that the film was having trouble attracting funding. Upon hearing this, King, who had written a review of the first film which helped it become an audience favorite, called Dino De Laurentiis and asked him to fund the film. Initially skeptical, De Laurentiis agreed but only alotted Raimi & company $3.6 million as opposed to them wanting $4 million to make the movie. This sequel was originally planned to send Ash back to Medieval times but it was scrapped because of funding. That concept, eventually, became the third movie in the Evil Dead series. Evil Dead II did quite well at the box-office with fans of the original returning to see the further adventures of their favorite hero, Ash. Only this time, it isn't so much a horror movie as it is a 'dark' comedy of sorts with lots of gore. It's further proof that movies of this type can succeed. This Special Edition DVD is packed with plenty of extras. Indeed, it's another classic worth adding to your collection.hero, Ash.

B00005N5S5|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Good amount of action and special effects.  There's not as much as the sequels, but there is enough to make it edgy and exciting.<br />*Lots of memorable parts.  The scenes of the future war are stark and frightening.  The finale is great.<br />*Excellent filming style.  It's very fresh, original, and memorable.<br />*Good story.  It's very simple but also very original.<br />*Good characters.  The actors are excellent.<br />*Good music theme.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*A little slow in the middle.<br /><br />This is still one of the most quintessential sci-fi movies ever made.  Its simple premise is executed effectively, leaving lots of room for strong characters, gripping action, and some good emotional moments.  It is also well-filmed, and contains some good special effects for its time.  The only downside is that the drama becomes a little intense towards the middle, slowing down the momentum.  Still, it really is one of the best.
0783227434|5.0|Army of Darkness is the third part of the \\"Evil Dead\\" trilogy directed by Sam Raimi. It was released in 1993 & starred Bruce Campbell, Embeth Davidtz, Marcus Gilbert, and the more widely known Bridget Fonda. The screenplay for the movie was written, mostly, in 1988. Sadly, though, this movie didn't do so well at the box-office. Yet, with it's release on video and DVD, it's found moderate success and has also garnered a cult following like the first two movies. In my opinion, it's the best movie out of them all. It's spawned comics, videogames. It's inspired in songs and horror stories. In this installment, Ash is sent back to Medieval times in his Oldsmobile, an event caused by reading a spell from The Book of the Dead to defeat the demons from the last movie. He is believed to be the 'hero from the sky' destined to deliver salvation to mankind from the \\"Deadites\\". The only way to return to his time and stop the Deadites, according to a priest, is to retrieve the Necronomicon. This proves to be quite a task for Ash. Without giving away the rest of the movie, let's just say Ash has his work cut out for him. Will he make it back to his time and defeat the Deadites? You'll have to watch the movie and see.<br /><br />Although this is a fine finish to a great trilogy, I hope it isn't the last we see of Ol' Ash. Hopefully, down the road at some point, we'll see Ash return again for another adventure.<br /><br />Til then, do yourself a favor and add this gem to the rest of your collection. It's a great movie and another classic.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|The Good Things<br />*Excellent filming style (much the same as \\"Pi\\").  Lots of strong memorable imagery.  Contains some of the most artistic and imaginative uses of special effects since \\"Fight Club.\\" Altogether, it's very vivid and intense.<br />*Characters are good and well-developed.  Good focus on their drama (without being too sappy).  By the end of the film, you can really feel for their losses.  It's quite emotional.<br />*Strong anti-drug message.  Even though everything seems cheery at first, it quickly becomes dark and frightening.  It's even more effective than any other drug movie I have seen (all of the ones I've seen have been upbeat for some wierd reason).  The characters, music, and imagery accentuates this central moral very well.<br />*Excellent music.<br /><br />The Bad Things<br />*There are a few graphic scenes at the end (and a few bits of nudity throughout the middle).  I didn't think it was as bad as everybody else says, but it's still not reccomended for the squeamish.<br /><br />Next to \\"Children of Men\\" and \\"The Passion,\\" this is one of the few movies that makes me want to cry.  It is a deep, dark, and powerful downward spiral into madness and despair.  As intense as it is, it truly makes me feel for the characters (and scares me away from ever doing drugs).  Above all, it sticks out in my head as one of the best, most stylish, and most memorable films made in the past ten years.  Everybody should watch this film at least once, for it is intense and somewhat thought-provoking.
0061142026|3.0|I must echo another reviewer in saying that I was first drawn to this story from the movie, but sadly I fear (and I have never said this about a book before) the movie was better.  The character development I felt was minimal and the story seemed to have a lack of spark between it's main characters.  Personally I enjoyed the movie more.
0743496728|5.0|I literally could not put this book down. I love Jodi Picoult! The first of her books that I read was My Sister's Keeper (still my favorite). I've also read Plain Truth & the Pact (high recommendations for both!). After reading those, I read Vanishing Acts and Keeping Faith and was thrilled by neither. After trying some different authors, I decided to give Jodi Picoult a try again and this book did not disappoint! If you loved My Sister's Keeper, you'll love this.
B000MR9D5E|5.0|My family and I fell in love with \\"Planet Earth\\" when we watched it on tv. This series certainly demonstrates nature's beauty in a rare form. Shot in high-definition, it makes you realize how much you appreciate this amazing place that provides us with life.     It was a no brainer that we would get this as a family gift as soon as it became available. The DVD set comes with all the amazing episodes, and includes film diaries of the people who spent 5 years shooting. You start to appreciate the effort and danger these people gave and faced, after viewing what they had to do in order to get those perfect shots. Also, you get an additional disc with 3 extras: Saving Species, Into the Wilderness, and Living Together. All of these extras emphasize the entire point of creating the series. They go into detail about endangered species, the effects the changing planet can have on life and the environment (mainly caused by humans), and the challenges of conservation for our planet's future.     This DVD set is a must own! Share it with everyone you care about!
B000H2N6GQ|5.0|If you've read any of Tom's books, you would know that he can sure write a good thriller. In fact, he's considered one of the best thriller novelists in the modern era, often mentioned alongside names such as John Grisham and Michael Crichton.     Rainbow Six is a great testament to that.    Rarely did I stop turning the pages in this one. The prose was flowing, the action was fast and the plot was engaging. Being someone who had served in the army before, I was attracted by the details of the mechanics surrounding the anti-terrorist team named RAINBOW. It's clear Tom knows his stuff. All the facts on the weapons were spot on, and the plot was very believable; with the US government being a part of a bio-terrorism scheme to exterminate the world's population, holocaust style. The multi-national team RAINBOW takes center stage, and for much of the book we learn about their members, their individual roles in the team and their many characteristics. Which is good; having the members of RAINBOW drive the book was a good move by Clancy.    The plot moves on in many threads, much like Ted Bell's SPY where we see many threads moving on in a chronological sequence. It has a very gradual build-up that many thrillers typically employ. RAINBOW started off being formed in the first few chapters to being a serious threat to the main problem (the bio-terrorism problem) in the end. The book moves in and out between the team, the bad guys (Popov and the terrorists), the US government and the many external forces influencing the situation itself. And the plot threads move at a very fast pace, making it very enagaging and urgent.     All in all, I found it a very exciting read. And I recommend it to all looking for a good thriller to plunge into.
B00012FXAE|5.0|For one if you've never seen this movie.....you need to remedy that.  It has it all a great story, good acting and a whole lot of future MARINE weapons.   This movie will always be one the best ever made.
B00070QXL8|5.0|This has got to be my all-time favorite movie ever!  I have both the first movie and the sequel and wish they'd come out with another one.  I just love the Bridget Jones character.  She's so loveable and chaotic - a bit like myself.  I can see so much of her in me.  Maybe that's why I like the movie so much.  I've watched it so many times, I've got it almost all memorized (the first one).  Please make another sequel!
B000OVLBHG|5.0|If your a man that likes blood guts and a little T&A your gonna love this movie.
B000002KKK|4.0|Deguello is the album that got me to really notice Z Z Top. Yes, I already had Tres Hombres & it's a better, more consistent album than Deguello, yet, for some reason, this was the album that made me sit up & notice them. Don't get me wrong, \\"Jesus Just Left Chicago\\" & \\"Been Waitin' on the Bus\\" are some of Z Z Top's coolest & best songs, but there's something here that's somewhat different. Maybe it's because my musical taste was evolving into a different direction at this time.<br /><br />But, for some reason, cool just came to the forefront on this album.The opening cover tune \\"I Thank You\\", written by Hayes & Porter, just jumped out of the speakers. It's probably the best cover they recorded. But the personality & the cool of Z Z Top would blossom on the songs \\"I'm Bad, I'm Nationwide\\" & \\"Cheap Sunglasses\\". These simply epitomized the cool of Top. We're also treated to \\"A Fool For Your Stockings\\" which is an outstanding example of Z Z Top's brand of Texas/blues-rock. An odd but entertaining song is \\"Manic Mechanic\\". The rest of the album is filler which is why I rate it below Tres Hombres, Deguello is not as consistent.<br /><br />Z Z Top is a tight little band from Texas, Billy Gibbons deserves more recognition for his guitar skills. No, he's not as flashy as some, but he's got his chops down & plays some of the best leads in rock. It's with this album that Z Z Top began to develop much of their personna; more development would occur with El Loco & then would fully blossom on Eliminator.
B0010ZR160|5.0|One of the best movies that I have seen in a long time. Kept me interested all the way through the movie.
0060005424|5.0|First off, let me state that Lirael is by no means the same book as Sabriel. The two main characters, although close in age are strikingly different in personality and mood. Sabriel's emotions are very reserved and distant, perhaps from her training in the necromantic arts. Lirael's are more that of an innocent young lady, not yet exposed to the burdens of death or the outside world in general.     While this might put off some readers who fallen in love with Sabriel, I believe there really isn't much more the author could have added to his original heroine in terms of a proper hero's journey. (Leaving their  realm of comfort and safety, delving deep into the unknown, and returning with the tools necessary to save their fellow man.) Lirael definitely delivers this, making for the detail-rich, well-planned story the likes of which we have come to expect for Mr. Nix.     With Lirael also comes the delightful character of the Disreputable Dog, who anyone that has ever owned a dog can definitely relate to! All in all, I can't help but give this story 5 stars. The characters are well developed, the story line flows, and the entire book is as much of a page-turner as the original Sabriel.
B00005JPKE|3.0|We did not realize that this film was entirely in Japanese and had a hard time reading the words in English fast enuf and the words were not always clear. We ended up giving it to a Japanese friend.
0060575816|5.0|I was amazed the first time I read this book. First purchased for me by a friend, I have since read the entire series and subsequent derivative works several times. I continue to be amazed by the depth and originality of the story's premise, and take particular interest in the unique portrayal of death.<br /><br />This series might also be of interest to those who are fans of the Resident Evil or other 'zombie' thriller types of stories...in a sense, it's like viewing the same plot driver from a fantasy point of view instead of science fiction. Still, that's a rather crude over-simplification of the story elements.
B0012K1ILW|5.0|Never owned an Erykah badu CD-- saw the video for Honey and was wowed. Bought the album on a whim, and I love it. 70's funk explosion greatness. My favorite album since Amy Winehouse, and it actually pushed Amy out of my heavy rotation!!
1401308201|5.0|My 11 year old daughter saw Wicked in December 2007, and was immediately hooked!  Soon after she saw the show, she found this book in our local chain bookstore, but decided not to buy it when she saw how much of her Christmas money she would have to spend.  So, she patiently waited, until one day she saw it on Amazon for 1/3 less (plus free shipping).  She bought it immediately, and has looked at it dozens of times since she got it.  **I've looked at it a couple of times myself...**  ;-)
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|This album is amazing because it's so different from the last albums, but it's still classic MCR. What really made me love this album was the ue of interesting sounds and effects for the songs like \\"Cancer\\", where it sounds like Gerard Way is altering his voice. These songs are just amazing to listen to and my friends love this album, too.
B00005JPXY|1.0|One of the biggest issues for me was obviously...the camerawork. I get it, OK?  I get that it's supposed to be some real live amateur filming of the attack, but it could have been a little more polished.  I got dizzy a few times.  It reminded me of all those YouTube videos where people are recording concerts while jumping up and down. Also, I've seen Blair Witch (you know it'll get compared to it), so this type of filming isn't foreign to me, but in Cloverfield, it was extra distracting.  And my goodness, that camera was stronger than Jack Bauer's cell phone--and we know that battery has yet to really die.    Aside from the technical stuff, it was just a boring movie with bad acting. I can appreciate a good viral campaign like every other business major, but at least have something to back it up. You know it's bad when you have no clue what the monster is, but you're just praying that it stomps all the main characters. Bad acting (what's the going rate for an actor that can say \\"Oh my G-d!\\" over and over?) accompanied by a lame script (does a movie like this really require the guy/girl drama?).    Cloverfield is simply a weak movie. I don't mind a movie where you have a monster or some crazy happenings and you can't quite figure out why (The Birds is classic, heck so is Tremors for that matter), but Cloverfield just missed so many marks.      It'll be on Starz eventually, so just hold off and save your money.
B00005A46T|5.0|this album was serious again from slipknot exept this one is not rap/metal like their debut this is just plain metal. They should keep this up whicth they did with their third album subliminal vol3 whicth was great to i just wonder when their fourth album is coming out but otherwise this was awsome the songs my plague and everything ends was solid metal very serious this album is amazing like their debut.
B000O178BY|2.0|I like the fact that he has a big concept. I like the cover. I like the intro. Track 2 is ok. Me, I'm Not is good enough. Overall: Disappointment. I think his idea would make a decent movie. This is kinda like I'm watching a movie with no picture and a repetitive soundtrack. It sounds like he created all the music (minus lyrics and concept) on a laptop in about three days.     My real beef, if I can find a way to express it correctly, is I guess the philosophy of reznor's headspace between With Teeth and year zero. I was never into NIN until With Teeth - the track Only was written very well and the last track is awesome. The whole album is quite introspective, and the music varied and fitting. I expected an expansion on the ideological/skeptic/perhaps nihilistic themes with his new album; kinda a continuation from Right Where it Belongs left off. With Teeth felt so honest, it was refreshing. This just feels like Trend Renzor is out being  a reactionary to bush, and jumping on this new wave of bush hatred. I hated bush since after our address to to the UN in 01 - something about that address and everything done after seemed illogical and phony. But feeling like that was oh-so-strange back then. Whatever finally ticked the nation off, be it Katrina or the slow realization that hey, bush has no clue what he's doing and his powerful posse is running the show behind the curtain with their own agendas, i guess now it's bandwagon time to hate all things republican; and you can see many an artist stimulated to create based on this new stirring of anti-bush/anti-hegelian-meets-Rumsfeld&Rove's-Machievellian-politics feelings instead of just doing what they do for the sake of their art. Now, instead of digging deeper into his own psyche, and writing super-introspective lyrics, which would've been a cool follow-up to With Teeth, we got reznor projecting all his energies \\"outwards\\". It's all through other people's eyes as they see all the plagues of society bearing down upon us.No more time for \\"Who am I?\\" and \\"What does my life mean/what is this life for?\\" wonderings. Not in today's choatic times, which have suddenly become so real after Katrina and the new focus of the mass public. Don't look inside and question why we're in the mess we are now; focus on the mess and what it could mean for the future!    My problem is this disc just reminds me of the new wave that seems to have crashed down on the collective conscious of mass culture nowadays, which is trying to spur us to hate bush and use our hate to go and separate ourselves from all things political and fight to regain our individual freedoms on the home front. First it was fight for freedom oversees, now it's a fight for freedom at home. Freedom freedom freedom, and change, change, change; that's what it's all about. Big ideas, and no focus on the self, and the real world, and the question to why we're so driven to embrace these sellable notions of freedom and change and all that in the first place. Why doesn't reznor focus on himself, and the music, and quit fretting over the new bandwagon wave that's hit the music scene? Doesn't he realize that perhaps that was one of the main points of the administration&the war that he's complaining about, to get us to focus our energies on perceived external enemies and the problems outside and struggle with the issues that come with globalization instead of focusing on the world inside and simply doing what you feel is right to you? If we all did that tho, we wouldn't have caused such problems to begin with, because we woulda realized the war and bush seemed fishy and illogical, but whatever, I guess that could just be looked at as a negative aspect of Christian dogma again - take all your internal issues, project them on some random, perceived enemy, and focus all your drive on battling that enemy; then, when you finally realize how bad you f-ed up, repent and whine and [...] and moan until you feel so bad you have to project your demons outagain, and the cycle continues.    Oh well, whatever gives you the drive to push onward, right? Reznor's certainly got that, with his whole crazy marketing scheme. I just wish he quieted his raging mind down a bit, and wrote some more complete and well-rounded introspective music again, and stopped pushing his focus outward. But oh well, whatever appeals to the bandwagon, and business, can't forget business, right? Him and Serj (\\"elect the dead\\") can go on tour now and [...] together while ignoring the fact that their actual music isn't that good.    [...]
B00004XOWM|5.0|this album was great again from LB my favorite songs was full nelson cause it was a real powerful song and it teaches you not to be a punk and to defend yourself but the song makes me to hype though but my second favorite was rollin air raid vehicle and the boiler but hey all these songs were powerfull and amazing a very hyper CD from LB the best album from LB and their 2 and 4 album really great their debut was trash but they enproved themselfs really good a album tottally worth buying really awsome.
B0014DBZT2|4.0|The prolific Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds have been refining and revitalising their music for decades but have not reached the end of their inventiveness yet. Severely cutting back on the trademark wailing violin and spooky piano - and with a noticeable dearth of songs about dead girls - \\"Dig, Lazarus Dig!!!\\" is rockier and funnier than the \\"Abattoir Blues/The Lyre of Orheus\\" offering [[ASIN:B0002SROSQ Abattoir Blues / Lyre of Orpheus]].  That 2004 dazzling double opus would have left lesser bands gasping for creative oxygen, but their thirteenth studio LP rather suggested a band with limitless artistic energy and endurance.  There's a sense of fun here - not always a mainstay of the previous 13 Bad Seeds albums - but we're back to Cave the poet, Cave the laconic chronicler, and he's being a bit more flowery about the rude stuff.   With much of the energy of the grungier \\"Grinderman\\" project [[ASIN:B000MX7YUE Grinderman]] Cave et al explored last year, \\"Dig\\" is stuffed with all the literary, biblical and mythological jumble fans can usually expect.   If there is a trademark Bad Seed sound, it is most apparent in \\"Jesus of the Moon\\", in which Cave's talent for emotive narrative is accompanied by elegant flute.    As verbose and intellectual as it is scary and unsettling, \\"Dig\\" is a baffling, dark masterpiece in which Cave deliberately sets out not to deliver the sweet tones of the piano or the guitar chords which massage the pleasure centres of the psyche.  Instead we get rock constantly verging on dissonance, with squalls of sound and numbing basslines.  There are few musicians, who have never had a major record deal, yet command an ever-growing audience and, at 50, are unleashing music with all the vigour and imagination of their youth.   Nick Cave turned out astonishingly primal garage-rock with last year's Grinderman album.  Here, back with the Bad Seeds, he veers wildly between grooviness, beauty and ear-splitting white noise.  The narratives he delivers are fantastically weird: on the title track, the biblical Lazarus returns from the dead in sleazy, pre-Giuliani  New York.   The song brilliantly repositions the myth of Lazarus in the moral swamp of 1970s N.Y.; with the Bad Seeds coming on like the Stooges after a funk injection, while \\"Moonland\\" is a Taxi Driver narrative with a man behind the wheel in lonely rage. \\"Albert Goes West\\" is a report of a psychotic episode which manages to rhyme 'vulva' with 'sucking a revolver'.   \\"We Call Upon the Author\\" is Cave addressing God, and chiding those who ask him to explain his songs. \\"I go guruing down the street\\", he wails, \\"Young people gather round my feet/Ask me things - but I don't know where to start\\".  Even when the maudlin \\"Hold On To Yourself\\" provides something musically straightforward - a theme which would not go amiss on the soundtrack to a spaghetti western - there is a din going on in the background which sounds like a colony of agitated bats.  Then listen to \\"Night Of The Lotus Eaters\\" and you have a clatttery blues riff around which there are guitar sounds which spookily resemble a creaking door. And then there is \\"Lie Down Here\\", whose intro sounds like a man involved in a fight to the death with feedback. This is one mean, ornery album. But it is not in the mould of the primeval Grinderman project.  It's much cleverer than that. \\"Dig\\" is, by Cave's own testimony, more expansive, teasing us with glimpses of psychedelia. You could draw comparisons as diverse as Tom Waits and The Fall, but \\"Dig\\" is simply great on its own terms.  It is a confident album by musicians who are not simply singing the songs they know will sell and it is an interesting, exciting and often irreverent offering. Adult, funny, packed with Freudian allusion and apocalyptic dread, it really is magnificent stuff.  Download : \\"We Call Upon the Author\\", \\"Midnight Man\\" and \\"Jesus On The Moon\\".

074325144X|1.0|After reading the many positive reviews and endorsements for this book, I anticipated something more thorough and more polished.  The book is highly repetitive (the same amount of material might easily have been covered in 40 pages), it lacks organization, the author invents words which have no meaning (\\"instate\\" as a verb, anyone?), and the typeset is HORRIBLE.    The author has some good ideas.  Let's hear them.....coherently.

B000YABYLA|5.0|I didn't care for Ellen Page before this movie. Having seen her in Hard Candy which I did not like and seeing her as Kitty Pride, the girl that tries to break up one of my favorite super hero couples in X-Men the Last Stand I didn't really see this movie because of her. But when I saw this movie I fell in love with it. I felt as if someone had taken my personality and put her on the screen and named her Juno. Although I did not get pregnant at 16 I found myself relating to Juno alot in almost every other aspect. This movie is incredibly well written and has a great cast. Michael Cera is adorable and great as Bleeker and I don't think there's a movie I've seen with Jason Bateman that I haven't liked. The music in this movie is so good as well, I own the soundtrack. I laughed so much during this movie and then even cried at the end. I was surprised to learn Juno's \\"roots\\" and the woman behind the story but it is a must see, I saw it twice in theatres and will be buying it when it comes out two days before my birthday.
B0012GVKW8|1.0|My 1-star review is not for the movie, Predator, which I love.  I bought it twice on DVD: the first single-disc release with no extras, and then the excellent 2-disc special edition.  I am not going to be buying on Blu-Ray, however, until the chowder-heads over at Fox start including all of the ALREADY PRODUCED extras on their Blu-Ray discs.  Case in point: Predator.<br /><br />Predator on Blu-Ray features a higher definition transfer (though on a single layer disc), but carries over none of the special features from the 2-disc DVD.  How hard would this have been?  Make it a dual layer Blu-Ray, and just throw them all on there in standard definition.  That would have guaranteed and instant buy for me.  But this habit of dumping the film bare-bones onto Blu-Ray is reminiscent of the early days of DVD, and I thought we were past that.  Other studios are doing a fine job of including all the special features, so why is Fox being dumb?  And why are they slapping a $40 MSRP on a bare-bones release?<br /><br />You would have had me with a good release, Fox.  I would gladly plonk down the cash for a true upgrade from my DVD version.  But you blew it, and you're not getting my money.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|As a fierce Badu loyalist (count me in amongst those small numbers that rate her Unplugged CD as one of the greatest albums of all time - in ANY genre), this album surprised me with its average-ness. Every Erykah record is an event worth waiting for. Most people just remember her 1997 debut \\"Baduizm\\" as her defining moment - but for true lovers of the neo soul movement, she has broken the mould time and again, especially on her \\"Worldwide Underground EP\\" (that album is also probably the only EP in neo-soul history that runs longer than most full-length albums of the genre). Erykah never cheats her listeners - always rewarding them with soulful music that clearly stands the test of time.<br /><br />In that context, this album is perplexing. In fact, I would use the word 'album' very loosely. At best, this is a collection of samples and sounds. I have to hand it to her though - some of the samples here harken back to obscure recordings from the 1950s, and they all work well when they have to - but in terms of being a cohesive piece of work, this is by far the weakest Erykah Badu record. Listening to the meandering opening track, its as if the producers let the artist experiment in the studio with no direction whatsoever - in some instances this can work - remember the amazing wordplay of Lauryn Hill on her ad-lib \\"Unplugged\\" album? Here, everything seems ill-advised, and worse, unlistenable.<br /><br />I never thought 'unlistenable' could ever be used to define an Erykah Badu record, but that you have it. Gone are those groovy beats and infectious choruses. Gone are the thought-provoking lyrics and songs that would sound amazing in concert. I love experimental music as much as anyone else, but this was really taking things too far. Lead single \\"Honey\\" is the most straight-forward thing here. If \\"Honey\\" is all you've heard so far and you want to know what the rest of the album sounds like - well, imagine it as a more lost and confused sounding version of that track, and you have the ultimate definition of what this album is all about.<br /><br />On \\"Telephone\\", Badu comes close to the genius of \\"Worldwide Underground\\", but an odd misstep towards the end of the song ruins even that. On first play, I let this play all the way through, hoping for something to grab me. Having listened to this in random order about four times now, its clear that this is either a) a substandard recording or b) I have no musical taste. Either way, the bottom line is that this is an album I didn't care for. Two Stars for the album, and one extra star for Erykah's former glory.<br /><br />For true masterworks of Neo-Soul, check out Maxwell's \\"Now\\", and the third album by Jill Scott. Also check out the underrated \\"What Am I Gonna Do\\" by 1974 chanteuse Gloria Scott.ltimate definition of what this album is all about.

0743298020|5.0|I loved this novel and saved it so I could pass it on to my friends. (I usually take most of my books to a book exchange). I liked the bits of history mixed in with family drama (although it was sad to see what happened to the twins and their brother, the dilapidated house, and ancient house staff) and how we got to see a lot about a relatively small group of characters. It starts out a little slow with the biographer in her book store job, but as soon as she arrives to start the bio, it gets really good. So keep with it! I loved the twists and turns at the end and didn't guess how it all panned out. The book is just the right length and very entertaining. Pick up a copy!

B00018D44U|3.0|On Feels Like Home, Norah Jones's sophomore album, she explored a more country-themed sound appropriate to her Texan roots and foreshadows her work with The Little Willies. The opening track Sunrise has percussion reminiscent of a horse's hooves clip-clopping away on some dusty trail straight out of an old Western, while What Am I To You flirts with blues that call to mind Norah's performance on Peter Malick's New York City. Be Here to Love Me is a beautiful slow waltz, while Creepin' In is a spirited, buoyant duet with Dolly Parton(!) laced with slide guitar. Long Way Home has a bouncy backing that reminds me of a jug band, while Humble Me is a steel-string guitar and Norah's soft croon. The remaining tracks capture the sort of laid-back (some critics called it \\"sopophoric\\") sound that Norah made famous on her debut [[ASIN:B00005YW4H Come Away with Me]], albeit with more of a countryish edge (steel guitar, lilting country and western rhythms).<br /><br />To be honest, I was working at a Barnes & Noble music department when this album was released, and I instantly took a dislike to it and tried to tune it out when we used it as in-store play. I wasn't terribly fond of the country overtones (country is one of the few musical genres that I can't stand, even though I live in Texas!), the songs weren't memorable, and there was a stylistic mismatch between the country tracks and Norah's other playing/writing style; Feels Like Home felt like it wasn't quite sure what it was trying to be. However, when I was recently on vacation and heard this played in a shop, I was drawn to it and decided to give it a second chance. I would place this second out of Norah's three albums so far (I really didn't like Not Too Late), and if you're a fan of country, you might like this more than I did. It does have some well-written songs and Norah's wonderful piano and voice to recommend it, but I still think that Norah's first album was her most versatile due to its seamless fusing of standards, country, and jazz. Feels Like Home felt less balanced overall.untry, and jazz. Feels Like Home felt less balanced overall.

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|In the early 90's, something special happened. For the first time, alternative music would no longer be the alternative. It would become the mainstream. R.E.M. was churning out catchy alternative pop long before anyone heard the names Cobain, Nirvana or Pearl Jam. When the rock world was finally turned upside down, R.E.M. would be noted for their influence on later alternative bands thanks in part to hit songs from their back catalogue and were noted for such recent era hits like Losing My Religion, Shiny Happy People, Man On The Moon and their biggest ballad Everybody Hurts. What's The Frequency, Kenneth? would show they could record songs just as loud and distorted as the bands influenced by them. By the way, Let Me In from 94's Monster was written about Cobain.    It only seemed fitting that the band would slip back into the underground with the loss of Bill Berry retiring and the decline of alternative music after having its peak.     Years later after albums gaining praise from mostly hardcore fans, the band has once again found its stride with their best album since Automatic For The People. The sticker on the shrinkwrap says so.     But is this really true? Is this nothing more than prepaid marketing? The answer is no. R.E.M. has indeed recorded their best album in years. Songs like Mr. Richards, Hollow Man and the lead off single, Supernatural Superserious, are a return to electric with pure pop R.E.M. feel. These songs are a breath of fresh air in an era that has since forgotten what good old fashioned R.E.M. pop has sounded like. Not hard to believe considering the band had departed from their glory, struggling to find their sound without a cofounding member. Seems they finally learned to run without Berry.    I'm Gonna' DJ might be experimental but it still retains that classic R.E.M. forumula that wasn't found on the previous album Around The Sun. This song could have been easily released on 87's break through album, Document (Best known for The One I Love and It's The End Of The World We Know It). Other songs like the title track and Sing For The Submarine revisit the eerie sounds of past albums such as Fables Of The Reconstruction but never lose their integrity with classic R.E.M. nature.    \\"He's alive he's alive\\" shouts Stipe on the lead off single. As is the traditional sound of the band on this record. Welcome back, boys
0893860220|5.0|If you're ever looking for all the wisdown contained in the great spiritual traditions condensed and explained clearly in volume, this book is a great place to go to. As with all great spiritual teachings, this book makes us realise the astounding sinmplicity of the realised state. It illustrates the law that the more complex a spiritual teaching system is, the less wisdom and truth it contains. I came across this book through Eckhart Tolle's recommended reading list. There are other great books there too - highly recommended is The Fall by Steve Taylor. [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]]
6303433766|5.0|Great movie, but I feel that Winslet's character had more to do with the tragic end of the friendship than Lynskey's character.  For the most part Pauline (Melanie Lynskey) followed Juliet's (Kate Winslet's) lead.  It seems that a lot of the reviews put 60% of the blame on Pauline because she's the dark, gloomy one, but really the wholesome Juliet had the more screwed up family life and outlook; especially when it came to her own abandonment issues.  Pauline was a perfect sounding board for Juliet's poor family life.  And as the friendship and teen pressures increased, both girls literally got lost in a world all their own.  Peter Jackson owes his career to this film.  If it had not been for it, there would have been no Lord of the Rings, King Kong, etc. HEAVENLY CREATURES is his masterpiece.
0452289963|5.0|I love the Power of Now but I think A New Earth is even more profound and lucid. I find that this book - like all Eckhart's books, but this one has it even stronger - has an almost uncanny power. Somehow you can feel the wisdom it contains seeping into you as you read and taking you a little closer to realisation. This book gives you a profound understanding of how the ego works, and after reading it you are never quite the same person again. We are amazingly lucky that Eckhart possesses such an acute intellectual mind with an enlightened spiritual state. (The two don't often go together.) I've also been reading books recommended on Eckhart's website, including another stunning book called The Fall by Steve Taylor. [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]] It goes together very well with A New Earth. The Fall goes very deeply into the origins of the ego and its insanity and compliments Eckhart's profound analysis.

In particular, I feel it is limited by putting much emphasis on achieving your desires.   This book is seen as a 'spiritual' text but really it's anti-spiritual, since ultimately it promotes a kind of selfishness and egotism. You only need to read A New Earth or Steve Taylor's The Fall [[ASIN:1905047207 The Fall: The Evidence for a Golden Age, 6,000 years of Insanity and the Dawning of a New Era]] to realise that this deeper spiritual insight is lacking.

This is the first poor release since \\"Engines Of Creation\\". I'll still see him live because he'll jam these songs totally different on stage. Nice try Joe, but this effort falls a little short.

B0000AZKPC|4.0|Most musicians that claim to \\"diversify\\" their style in actuality fall victim to a rather pathetic formula.  There may be less of the parent material, but the new and different elements only replace about 20%.  You could expect, for example, a brief piano feature on a mostly metal song, or maybe supplemental instrumentation is so far in the background it is still hardly noticeable over the blast beats, scratchy riffs, and toneless, larynx-eroding screams.  Though power metal is generally more musical and more sparse on the screaming aspect anyway, Sonata Arctica, upon releasing their debut album \\"Ecliptica,\\" breached etiquette even further by making a sound that was not only melodic, but unusually symphonic -- even for power metal.  Instead of cowering inside the 80-percent-metal-20-percent-other comfort zone, Sonata's sound is quite possibly closer to 50 percent base metal and 50 percent symphonic elements including piano, harpsichord, synth-strings, synth-lead, synth-chorus, and other ambient keyboard instrumentation.  Though reading the aforementioned may incite images of a refined baroque orchestra, rest assured Sonata Arctica are anything but laid back.  Imagine a Trans-Siberian Orchestra cutting loose on spring break and doing non-seasonal numbers, and you're pretty close to the mark.  But their style also draws from both classic and more aggressive modern metal, with both synchopated and \\"machine-gun\\" riffs, rapid pumping double bass pedal drum beats; and leads that bring out the air-guitar maestro in all of us--(provided, of course, that no one is watching you make an embarrassment of yourself at that time).  Far from finished, the symphonic intrumentation ingredients are added to create an extremely energetic colloid of sonic pleasantry with head-filling ambienece and diverse chord structures that sound as though J.S. Bach got caught red-handed in the act of making heavy metal. (Although, if for some reason metal and baroque were never meant to go togetherthen poor Bach is probably doing about 12,000 rpm by now!)    Sonata Arctica have since released several studio albums as of the period this review was written (April 2008).  To those who are new to hearing this unique form of melodic heavy metal and are having trouble deciding where to listen first, I say where other than the beginning!  Even in the shadow of Sonata's newer sets, \\"Ecliptica\\" is still just as inspiring as it was upon introduction.    As personal preferences weigh any review, I find that Tony Kakko's falsetto style still had a little room for refinement in \\"Ecliptica.\\"  Also, I am one who thoroughly believes that metal guitars and pipe organs go together like bolts and receivers, and Ecliptica did not have quite as much organ as Sonata's later albums.  These finite nitpicks only cost half a star, but good ol' Amazon just has to round to whole numbers... so don't take the above illustration of those four yellow cartoony stars to heart.  No, this one actually gets: **** 1/2 (four-and-uh-half stars).  Good job!  Success!
B000Z0OX9O|3.0|The soundtrack's extended saga is as annoying as the many iterations of the film itself. Don't get me wrong, I love both music and movie (saw every version in the cinema upon their various releases) and as works of art, they both earn 5 stars.  I just would be happy with one version of each, unadulterated.  For me the 1992 Director's cut made a great film better -- now stop there. As for the music, the bootleg Esper edition did the best job giving fans most of the score, in sequence, with some key dialogue (lots of Deckard & Rachel, and Roy's valedictory speech left intact), and with the extra music Vangelis included on his official '94 release. My attitude towards soundtracks is that if I like a film's score, I want it, so strip out the dialogue (well, maybe not in this case!) and let us hear the music as it appeared at the moment of viewing. I love all classic Vangelis (Spiral, China, Masque -- you name it) but this triple-disc set is just a scam. Or a sham. Or both.<br /><br />Revised opinion (2013): My original complaint was in reaction to disc 1 and to Vangelis's ongoing attitude towards making the complete score available. Really, the other discs are fine. The second harbors a fair chunk of that rare score, albeit retooled and boosted by two fine new tracks, and emerges as an entirely different Vangelis rendering of Blade Runner. His first version took stuff he liked from the film, jiggered it a bit and added great new music (i.e., Blade Runner Blues) to make his audio rendering of the story. That's what he's done here too, and this latest variant stands on its own as an atmospheric, rather ambient album that would appeal to fans of Soil Festivities or the quieter parts of Antarctica. The results are understandably annoying to Blade Runner purists, but to be fair, that's what he always did for his soundtrack work (see Alexander, 1492, even Chariots of Fire). As for the third disc, it offers some serviceably progressive and uptempo compositions (sampling the OST in a couple of places) that recall The City or even See You Later, especially with Up & Running, No Expectation Blvd, and the beautiful Piano In An Empty Room. I quite enjoy shuffling discs 2 & 3 together, in fact, for an extended \\"new release.\\" So overall a good Vangelis album, just not the Holy Grail we were hoping for.T in a couple of places) that recall The City or even See You Later, especially with Up & Running, No Expectation Blvd, and the beautiful Piano In An Empty Room.

0440422973|3.0|Luther and Nora's life is in turmoil as their daughter, Blair, is departing to Peru with the Peace Corps for a year of charity work. Blair will even miss Christmas this year. With everything up in the air and uncertain old traditions come under question. Luther, an accountant, does a tally of last year's Christmas expenses and discovers that the whole thing cost over $3,000.00. Isn't Christmas just rampant consumerism? Isn't the whole holiday one mad rush, filled with stress as we worry that everything is just right? Couldn't this money be spent in a better way? Suddenly Luther has a 'brain wave' that this year he and Nora will just \\"skip Christmas\\". But of course nothing is as simple as it seems.<br /><br />John Grisham normally writes lawyer and courtroom dramas, but this book is a strong departure from that genre. It is, so far, Grisham's only attempt at comedy. The book is not bad as a first attempt, however, it contains some flaws. The most clear failing is that the first half of the book is just too repetitive. There are three visits from the boy scouts, the ambulance and the police all following the same basic script. There are two calls from the stationary shop. I got the point of these incidents the first time round and I didn't need to have the idea repeated again and again like I was learning my times table. I felt that Grisham would have been much better off writing a novella, as he did with _Bleachers_, rather than trying to make this a full novel. Secondly having read the book I was left wondering a bit about its philosophy. What exactly is Grisham trying to say? After all doesn't Luther have a reasonable point? Isn't Christmas just too commercial? The ending seems deny this and reaffirm the 'glitzy' status-quo. Or does it? Well at least Grisham has made me think.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong here: I am not saying this is a bad book. It is written in a very enjoyable style and I found myself liking Luther and Nora quite a lot. There are some chuckles along the way and the book certainly is good enough to fill a few empty hours.along the way and the book certainly is good enough to fill a few empty hours.
B00013RC8O|4.0|First of all, I want to say I really liked this film for what it was: a car chase film, show-casing domestic muscle cars, a shallow plot, and contemporary music. Its not a great movie when it comes to the storyline, but the action scenes are great, especially if you're a fan of muscle cars and rebellion. Anyways, the vehicle used in this movie, a 1970's Dodge Challenger, is a thunderous symbol of the power inherent in the American spirit of rebellion that hearkens back to the revolutionary war.
B0015KO52S|5.0|very much enjoyed the mix of styles by the boys.     keep going back to it, and it keeps getting better with each listen.    just when you think the first five songs are the highlights the cd veers into the last three that take it to another level.    alot of diff styles but everything sounds very unified with a fantastic rhythm section. benson & white are great sweet & sour vocal duo. Almost feels like a bit of the Police & Who, and some 70s pop in some places of the cd. With zep all over the mix.    eclectic but unified....    alot of fun and just in time for the car windows to come down and crank it... :)    4 great cds so far this year reflecting the glory days of rocks past, yet never nostalgic: radiohead, drive bye truckers, vampire weekend, and now this. who says classic rock is dead? ;)    an embarrassment of riches. easily as good as the heyday of 70s rock, whether stadium, punk, or new wave.    cheers
B000VBIEXS|2.0|This is a great album, obviously, but I have a few things to add about the mastering. I've read all the reviews of the Sanctuary import version, and a lot of the same problems are here, as well. The first four tracks are fully remastered on this Shout! version, but the entire Karn Evil 9 suite sounds like it was taken directly from vinyl! I can hear all the same imperfections I remember hearing on vinyl growing up. It sounds like they used the wrong tapes for Karn Evil 9, because that suite is NOT remastered. The difference is very obvious!!!

It was with some trepidation that I purchased their newest CD set from Wal-Mart.  I guess my expectations exceeded reality for I view the album as formulaeic, overly produced and with no sharp edges.  In other words: an album that is bland to the point of having virtually all of the old Eagles uniqueness squeezed from this set.  Bland.  Smooth.  Elevator music.  No fire; no risk; no spark.  Dull, with some \\"decent\\" songs but not enough of them.  Sadly, I have to recommend that you save your money unless you are a true collector.  In that case, leave it unwrapped, store it, and save your expectations a wicked bash.

B000LXH0AE|5.0|I don't like to give away the plot of a film that I've seen, so I won't on this one, either. Suffice it to say, I wasn't a big Will Ferrell fan, but, I AM NOW. I also LOVED Queen Latifah and the rest of this cast. Dustin Hoffman and Emma Thompson! I'm still reeling! But, honestly, who amazes me the most with her incredibly inspired performance is Maggie Gyllenhaal! She is priceless in this role I can't take my eyes off her when she is on screen. She is the glue that made this film work as well as it did! Kudos To Maggie!  I didn't think I was going to like this film, in fact, I was prepared to dislike it as I figured it was going to be another over the top Ferrell comedy. How refreshing to find out that it isn't.   In his first dramatic role (of sorts) Will Ferrell turns in an incredibly believable performance as the main character.   This film is ingenious in it's execution of a plot that will leave you in awe, wondering \\"who thinks these things up??\\"   I was so thoroughly entertained by this film that as soon as it was over, I started it again and watched it one more time. I wanted to catch each nuance of the performances and of the plot development.   Since then I have watched the film at least 8 to 10 additional times, showing it to friends who had the same opinion of Will Ferrell that I did and those who didn't but, hadn't seen the film yet. They are all Ferrell fans now!   We ALL agree, this is a sleeper hit that should have at least gotten more oscar nods than it did and should have won. Brilliant script, superior ensemble cast, great direction and eye candy to watch because it is filmed with such great attention to detail. Probably one of the best films of 2006 and an instant addition to my own library at home! This is one film you must see.
B000WQ9UA8|4.0|It's really unfortunate that her life turned for the worse before she had time to promote the album. It really is good.<br /><br />It's a little overproduced, but it does well for teh album mostly because the album has that nightclub/red light district feel to it. The songs are expertly written and are reminiscent of Britney's last album \\"In the Zone\\". Where that album was scared, this album let loose.<br /><br />The high points on the albuym include: \\"Hot As Fire,\\" \\"Toy Soldier,\\" and \\"Radar.\\" While there are most good songs, these stand out to me for production and entertainment value. Another gem on the album is the last track, specifically written to and for her ex. I feel that the song is a great expression of her feelings for the relationship.<br /><br />Overall, the album is really great, and should've put her back on top. However, we know what happened, os no use crying over spilled milk.<br /><br />And for those who are bashing her album based on her current state of affairs, GROW UP!!! This album is no different than her music early in her career, and if we could take the blinders off for a sec, you'd see that she's actually a good pop star, and had a pretty meritable career.
B00104QSOM|1.0|First off, I think that this is an amazingly epic piece of work which, in some ways, reminded me of a kind of big sprawling 1950's esque epic that someone of a George Stevens caliber might have made.    Now, on to the mundanely disappointing packaging. What the hell was Paramount thinking!!! Cardboard stock dvd case???!!! If you decided to purchase this movie, be forwarned, you will have a hell of a time getting the discs out of the case and an even harder time with not scratching the darn things by doing so.    I am giving the movie 4 1/2 stars and 1 star to the packaging Einstein who thought up this mass produced cardboard mess of a case housing these discs. Absolutely terrible...
B000VUFJ3C|5.0|Disclaimer: I am a fan, have been one for over 10 years, and will always be!!!<br /><br />That said, this review will actually be unbiased!<br /><br />I am very impressed, if not amazed with the risk the boys took on this album. Risk? What risk you ask? The risk of going back to a pop music that is filled with love ballards, treat-you-right lyrics, po arrangements, and boy-bandy goodness.<br /><br />For a fan's reference, this album would've fit great between \\"millenium\\" and \\"black and blue\\". For general audiences, the album reverts abck to a time where boy bands were radio friendly, and TRL was still cool. It's like the took the maturity of their voices, the fact that they've been around for 15+ years, and said \\"Screw it!!!\\" This album is fun, pop-fare. Upbeats, power ballads, and sweet lyrics sung out with crooner precision.<br /><br />Even if you're one of the boy band haters, you can't deny that the album is an amazing effort from a band that's seen it all.<br /><br />The only downside is what I have been praising the whole review: the reversion abck to late 90's pop. While I love it, I thought the direction of the last album \\"Never Gone\\" was cool, and I would have liked to see them continue on the path (acoustic arrangements, slightly more poetic and mature lyrics).<br /><br />But, alas, this album is nostalgic and takes fans, new and old, back to what pop is and probably should get back to--simple ballads, dance beats, and harmonies that make us swoon.<br /><br />If you're tired of the pop/hip-hop/R&B/rock fusions out today and want some good ol' fashion boy band pop, then this is it! A great pop album by a great pop group!<br /><br />(side note: i purposely left out the part about them being four, instead of five, members because I am still a little upset about that!)
B0011NVC9I|2.0|This sci-fi film is  a bit weak, a body-enhanced  second rate actor said to have acted in East Enders (a long running UK soap) fights monsters etc supposedly in the raw. The most interesting thing is not the film but the documentary showing how scenes were filmed, all the CA gadgetry that you can imagine and then some!  Just watch it once to the end if you can without going to sleep first.  A very forgettable endeavour.
B00005JPTK|2.0|Overall, the main flaw of this movie was in it's story and execution, which is quite possibly the biggest thing in a movie.<br /><br />I was impressed cinematically--sweeping landscapes, great use of CGI and special effects, editing and camera angles. But, a movie needs more than that to be worth anything.<br /><br />I went in expecting a zombie movie (which is partly the fault of the movie execs and how they advertised the movie), and what I got was a half-drama, half-suspense film that was too long for what it was trying to say. Too many scenes with Smith worrying about himbeing the last man on earth. Where Smith usually shines, in his predictable hero-esque roles, he fails here--as a scientist who experiment goes wrong. His acting suits the story, but not the desperation or fear a man in his place may have. The best scene in the movie, and the one that may have been Smith's best acting in the role, involved him and his dog and a fod hunt gone wrong. However, the movie turns or the worse when he realises he may not be the only person still alive. However, by this time in the move, the audience is a little tired, to say the least, and I;m not sure anyone cares if he makes it out alive.<br /><br />I was disappointed that the movie had no elements of suspense, sans the dog hunt scene, and I left the theatre wondering if I had seen the right movie.<br /><br />Another gripe was the length. The story was too drawn out, and one has to reason if the writers really had a story to begin with (yes, I know it was a remake, but the other ones were definately better, and had some story to work with).<br /><br />Essentially, I was caught between figuring out the genre of the movie (drama or suspense or zombie thriller) and wondering when the hell it was going to end.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I hated to see SG-1 end, okay 10 years is a major accomplishment for any TV Series. But, in my opinion, the writers did a very good job of taking the story from hour long episodic adventure and creating a 2 hour movie. Also, it appears that there is a second movie in the making... I look forward to keeping the collection growing.    This is a good showing from a movie that was better with the director's cut filling out the missing pieces. Then transferring to the small screen, and taking us on a journey worth the ride.
B000I5Y8ZU|5.0|My Chemical Romance's third album is The Black Parade. it was released on October 24, 2006. Their first single from the album was Welcome To The Black Parade, witch first aired on the radio on September 11, 2006. On September 26, 2006, the music video for Welcome To The Black Parade was released. It reached number one in American October 15. Famous Last Words was their second single, it was released on January, 22 2007. Third single was I Don't Love You, witch was released only in UK on April 2, 2007. The forth single was Teenagers, witch was released July 9, 2007.     The Black Parade World Tour started on February 22 2007, with Rise Against, Thursday, and Muse as support acts. At the first concert of the tour in Manchester, New Hampshire, My Chemical Romance announced the addition of Reggie and the Full Effect frontman James Dewees, who will play keyboards/synth on the tour.     The Black Parade is their alter ego for this album. the premise for this record in The Black Parade Press Conference Gerard says \\"when you die I'd like to think, that when you die death comes for you however you want. and I feel that it's your strongest memory ether your childhood or adulthood. and for this particular character in this record called the Patent, his strongest memory is of being a child, his father is taking him to this parade. so when death comes for him, it comes in the form of the black parade.\\"       I love this album, It's not a was of money at all!!!
0679746323|5.0|This is a riveting biography of one of history's worst mass murderers told in a chillingly understated style. This man killed tens of millions of innocents as he lived in luxury. I could not put it down.
B00133KFGW|4.0|I grew up hearing music all the time...it was in my dreams, I woke up singing songs, even as a young child, songs I would make up, or that really, would just flow through me.  So, I related to this movie and it inspired me.  Other critics may say this is a sappy movie, but I found it to be sweet, uplifting and very beautiful.  I felt like it was a love song to music itself, and of the power it holds.  I loved the acting, the songs, the plot...all of it.
6305754969|3.0|They just don't make movies like this anymore, which is why I like these westerns more and more as time goes by. Good guys and bad guys, horses and guns, Robert Mitchum and John Wayne! What more could you ask?       Oh,and lets not forget the scene where commie-lib Ed Asner gets pistol-whipped by Robert Mitchum. That alone makes it worth buying.
B00005B4GU|1.0|Terrible. Boring.     What a complete disappointment. Bought this CD from the bargain bin and still feel I was ripped off.

0452289963|5.0|Copied from The Christian Newswire:<br />(Canfield, OH April 14, 2008) Pews are abuzz with concerned believers who want to know if there is a Christian book alternative to Eckhart Tolle's `A New Earth.' Kimberly Lisowski and Andrea Pouliot, co-authors of the newly released Christian non-fiction book, `The Apple You Were Fed,' would say yes.<br /><br />Arguably, there is a need for the depth of spirituality and personal insights Tolle brings when nearly 80% of young people walk away from the Christian faith, and over 50% of Christian marriages end in divorce. `The Apple You Were Fed' bridges this gap by offering the same spiritual awareness but from a Christian perspective.<br /><br />A spiritual tutorial, which Tolle does well, can often lead to more questions about living out the concepts in a practical world of everyday problems and life issues. While Tolle teaches, Lisowski and Pouliot uniquely share from two voices: a legalistic, stay-at-home, Christian, and a working, liberal-minded agnostic.  As readers eavesdrop on two relatable women who show the gritty process to spiritual freedom as it unfolds rather than communicating their findings as do teachers, questions arising about how to live in a broken world are answered.<br />Their lives are fair game: past secrets, parenting mishaps, stressed marriages, struggling faith... they show all of it. By discipling readers through their trials of everyday life, Lisowski and Pouliot push past intellectual barriers, and force honest dialogue about deeper personal matters allowing readers to follow their path to enlightenment- Jesus style.<br /><br />\\"People are asking, `How do I stop the destructive patterns in my life?' or `Why do I have it all, yet struggle with feeling unfulfilled?'\\" Lisowski states.  By showing rather than telling, `The Apple You Were Fed' offers perspective to those answers. Pouliot confirms, \\"Our hope is to share that this Truth can be found in regular lives, without having to study for years in a monastery or travel the globe. It is possible to get `it' right at your kitchen table with a good friend.\\"<br /><br />Undoubtedly, `The Apple You Were Fed' will be the first to fill the void `A New Earth' has created in the Christian book world. For Tolle readers who are left in need of an anchor for the spirituality that he teaches, `The Apple You Were Fed' will share how Jesus' message of love had this \\"Truth\\" all along, and offer the addition of an inspiring yet practical view of how to live out this life-changing spirituality.<br /><br />Read more about `The Apple You Were Fed' by visiting [..]<br /><br />Or purchase today!

B0013F2M52|4.0|Elbow, one of my favorite active bands, have never made a truly perfect album, and this isn't one either. It doesn't need to be. Destined as with its predecessors to get many and many a spin in my player, Elbow's fourth release continues to demonstrate why they are far ahead of the field. The murky, melancholy Mancunian brit-rockers give us another round of pint-aided romantic reflections on the everyday, with the customary layers of thick guitars, pianos, and cavernous snares and kicks.<br /><br />In each previous album, Elbow's thrown something new into their trademark sound. This time, it's a bit of a showman's edge, most notable in the the zany track The Fix (which with Richard Hawley's co-vocals sounds like a preposterous musical number from a Tim Burton flick), and also on One Day Like This (the string melody of which recalls My Fair Lady). There is a greater emphasis on the string section, starting with the dramatic stabs in the otherwise breezing opening number Starlings. As always, there's a classic Elbow stomp track (the amusing Grounds for Divorce takes its place alongside kindred spirits Fallen Angel and Forget Myself). There's the late-album lull (the piano-dominated Some Riot). There's the would-be anthem (One Day Like This tries but doesn't have the stunning emotional power of the immaculate Grace Under Pressure from Cast Of Thousands). There's the classic piano-driven ballad (Mirrorball, a gorgeous track, one of their best).<br /><br />Then of course there's Guy Garvey's top-notch lyricism, again on display here. If Asleep in the Back's lyrics were dominated by urban rat race discontent, Cast of Thousands' by gossip, and Leaders of the Free World by love and heartbreak, this record has a far more domestic feel, which seems natural as the band ages. Songs about fatherhood, divorce, old friends, and the like abound. Garvey still has the unique ability to be brilliant about the ordinary. \\"We took the town to town last night, we kissed like we invented it,\\" he sings on Mirrorball.<br /><br />For me, this outing doesn't quite carry the natural ease of fit that their debut did, so I'll call it their second or third best record, if I've got to rank 'em. Still, by the time we reach the outro -- the gentle and moving Friends of Ours, a track similar to Great Expectations from their last record -- The Seldom Seen Kid has taken its place as one of the band's highlights. When these guys come up with a best of -- and here's one fan hoping there will be several more records of this caliber before it comes to that -- the top numbers from this will fit in right alongside all the rest.Mirrorball.

038073186X|5.0|I just finished shutter island today after buying it two days ago. I must say it is an amazing read. I found myself staying up late into the night fully enthralled in the book. The plot gives nothing away to what truly is a shocking ending. I highly recommend it to anyone who wants to read a book that will have you on the edge of your seat until you finish the last page.
0743496736|5.0|In trying to describe a book I just finished, I am having difficulty finding the right words.  The book is titled \\"Nineteen Minutes\\" by Jodi Picoult.  It takes place in a small town that could be anywhere.  It attempts to tell the story of a fictitious but all too real high school shooting.  No matter what your age you are either living it or have knowledge of what takes place in schools across the county.  If you feel your child is too young for this book read it for them.       For book clubs this would make for an enlightened discussion.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I have been a fan of R.E.M. from their inception and I can't express how happy I am to see them return to their roots.  After ending up in the limbo state of Up, Reval, and Around The Sun, they have finally shaken off their introspective experimental chains and returned to what they do best.  Every track on thsi album seems to blow back to Monster, one of their best works.  But there is no need to compare it to their past works, this is just an amazing album.  Welcome back R.E.M.!
B0010X73ZG|5.0|Amazing movie, very Scary, The special effects need more work, but overall is a very good movie.    I liked the fact that the people inside the store are more scary than what is in the Mist, thats why i think this movie is so good.    And the ending very Shocking.

0307394549|5.0|I love everything \\"Martha\\" because she just does it all right. This book is no exception. There is a recipe for any type of cookie you can imagine and they are sorted into sections depending on the type you are looking for. There is even a \\"picture index\\" showing all the cookies. I'm not a master baker but the directions are simple and very clear. I can't wait to make every cookie in the book.
B0015HS5TA|5.0|I was absolutely bowled over by the performances of Frances McDormand & Amy Adams in this movie.  Naturally I expect nothing but the best of Ms. McDormand, who won a well-deserved Oscar as the pregnant policewoman (with fantastic accent) in Fargo.  And she never disappoints.  Her metamorphosis from caterpillar to butterfly was wonderful to see.    Amy Adams played a very difficult role.  It would have been easy for Delycia to seem slutty &/or scheming, but somehow in Ms. Adams' capable hands she was loveable and even a little innocent.  I found her charming, and her singing voice is lovely.      The storyline held my interest throughout, and I loved the happy ending for both women.  I must admit that I was glad Delycia and Michael got out of London before the blitz.      At the end of the movie, my husband surreptitiously wiped a tear from his eye.  That from him is high praise.  Well done, one and all!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|It's great to keep the SG-1 team actively on the screen.  I enjoyed the \\"Ark of Truth\\" but must say that for the dedicated fan, there weren't too many BIG surprises.  Interesting ending.  I hope the team can periodically do more movies.

B000EGF0QY|4.0|Me Talk Pretty One Day is not your run-of-the-mill memoir or collection of short stories.  Not by a long shot.  David Sedaris' biting wit will have you laughing out loud by page one.  Whether it's the struggles of a boy with a lisp in speech therapy class, the absurdity of a college instructor assigning soap operas for homework or the irreverent descriptions of an uncooperative bowel movement, Sedaris' caustic prose leaves you with painfully-aching sides.  Don't read this book in public if you're afraid to be seen--and heard--cracking up.  And don't be surprised if between laughs you find yourself learning about life and appreciating the author's insights. [[ASIN:1592993052 Salmon Run]]
B000G8NXYG|5.0|The video and audio quality are nearly perfect.  Much better than the copy I saw 18 years ago.  Wonderful to see the entire movie: all 207 minutes.    Note, this movie is not for someone who wants to sit down for an hour and watch a ton of action.  If you want to see \\"Seven Samurai\\" and know what you are getting into, then buy this movie.  If you are just hunting around for an action flick, you might try something else.

B000YGIIQI|5.0|If you thought you knew Gordon Ramsay, read this book and discover the real Gordon! He is not the guy on Hell's Kitchen but a smart, sensitive, scrapper who climbed his way out of an Oliver Twist like hell. Talk about passion, he defines passion. Another thing, this book is clearly written from the heart.  He states things as they were without pity for himself.  What a dad he had!
B00140PK6O|5.0|Finally, a period drama that's neither the same old story nor lost in translation.    I thought Cranford would be a subdued drawn out dramatization but I was pleasantly surprised to find it so engaging at every moment. The adaptation had managed to make every character useful and meaningful in a drama where everyone's a hero at the end of the day. And the actors - please don't make me choose between them. They were all plucked out of Cranford itself, I'm sure.    One theme stood out for me. The danger of conjecturing, the gossip it perpetuates and the lives they can destory. Even so, it was impossible to truly fault the culprits as Gaskell shows that a person should be judged as a whole and not by a single deed alone.    I won't dwell into the details as it is too colorful and summarizing would do it injustice but suffice it to say Cranford was very well written with much thought placed into the evolution of characters and the seamless integration of plots. It has everything a little old town can manage.    Do not hesitate. Watch it!

B000W0DFDM|5.0|I love this book.  It tells the truth about how guys think, in a simple, straight-forward, yet amazingly accurate way.  It's chock full of examples that help illustrate the authors' point: Men are simple.  They make time for women they're hot for, no matter how busy or preoccupied they are. If your guy is full of excuses as to why he can't be with you/call you/email or text you, the reality is inescapable...he's just not that into you.  Quick, entertaining, informative read.  Buy it and never live in denial again!

B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been using this DVD for about a week and a half now and I love it!  Like the others have said, it has 3 levels comprised of 3 circuits (strength, cardio, and abs) each.  I'm not the most fit person in the world, but I have been working out 4+ times a week for the past few years.  These videos kick my butt!  I started out doing level 1 and 2 back-to-back. By the end of level 2, I am on the ground.  These workouts make me sweat just as much if not more than the 45+ minute classes I was taking at the gym.  Like the others have said, you do not rest for the 20 minutes.  Maybe 5 seconds to catch your breath, but that's it.  As Jillian says, if you're going to workout for 20 minutes and see results, you MUST work intense for those 20 minutes.  I also have her 5-disc series, which I really like as well. The Cardio Kickbox rocks. I've been alternating her kickboxing with the Shred to mix it up.    I am SO glad I bought this DVD.  If you want to try it, you should. It will be the best $12 you ever spent on a workout DVD.

This book allowed us to draw the animals together and he was able to follow the steps easily.  If you can write the letter \\"D\\", \\"C\\" and stright and squiggly lines you can duplicate any animal is this book.  Pretty cool since my son used to not like art of any sort but now he is in this drawing phase.  I'm going to buy some other of these books in the series.

B00104QSOM|5.0|There have been a number of films over the past year that have garnered much critical acclaim, mainly because these are the kind of films that it seems just aren't made anymore.  There Will Be Blood is one of them, and is arguably the best effort that writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson has ever put to celluloid, most notably thanks to the brilliant, Oscar winning performance of Daniel Day-Lewis as oil tycoon Daniel Plainview.  Plainview's rise is chronicled as he, along with his adopted son H.W. (Dillon Freasier), sets sights on an oil-rich land inhabited by the Sunday family, whose evangelist son Eli (Paul Dano) Plainview soon comes into conflict with.  There is even more going on in between all the proceedings, as Anderson presents an amalgamation of greed, love, redemption, and torment.  Not only is Daniel Day-Lewis a magnetic sight to behold, but every other performance (from Freasier, to Dano, to Kevin J. O'Connor, to Ciaran Hinds) are their own little miracles.  Everything else, from Anderson's direction, to brilliant and breathtaking cinematography, to a hair raising music score; all adds up to the modern day masterpiece that is There Will Be Blood.  While it is certainly not for all tastes, There Will Be Blood is a brilliant film regardless, and in that respect alone, the film is a must-see.

B00132D808|4.0|This is an entirely new sound from Panic! at the Disco.  This album is full of that Beatles/Beach Boys type of music.  And I think it's pretty cool.    I own Panic!'s first CD and I'm a moderate fan of that genre of music (whatever it may be called).  But this CD is really something completely different.  This could be bad or good, depending on the listener.  If you're only looking for that \\"A Fever...\\" brand of music, you will likely be disappointed.  But if you're a fan of different musical genres, you might, like me, find this to be a nice little collection of retro pop.    I'm really big on the Beatles and I thought this album was a nice homage to their style.  You can really hear the Beatles influence and it's not so much a rip-off of their tunes as it is a tribute to their legacy.    I see this as a concept album.  An album of Beatles-esque '60s pop music, only sung by that guy from Panic! at the Disco.  To me, the guys of Panic! at the Disco had an idea for an album and went out and made it happen.  I think they did a good job.  They can't out-Beatles the Beatles, but they do their best interpretation of them.    I don't know how well this album will do on the charts or if it will please the band's fanbase, but I certainly think it's an interesting and creative endeavor.  A nice addition to the band's resumé.    If you're looking for the old Panic! sound, this is not it.    If you like the Beatles, this is worth checking out.  Or at least listen to the samples.  And if you're a Panic! fan and you like this album's sound, you should check out the Beatles' albums.

015603283X|4.0|Books with missing manuscripts or mysterious artworks, et al, at their centers must get together and breed, they're becoming so common ... but I'm still a sucker for them. This was a fun, mildly thought-provoking read. Not as good as the Booker-winning Possession by A.S. Byatt, but not as ephemeral as most thriller/mysteries, either.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I read \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" (Pillars) first and just finished \\"World without End\\" (World).  I  enjoyed both of them. After finishing Pillars and before reading World, I read many of the reviews for World and was somewhat hesitant to invest time and money in World as the reviews seemed rather negative and not as positive as the reviews given Pillars. Now that I have read both books I believe World was just as good as Pillars and my only regret was that I finished reading them both. I would be hard-pressed to say which book was better. Yes, if you want to be a critic you can find fault (e.g., historically inaccurate, too much sex, absence of a central theme like Pillars, blah, blah, blah) with World, but remember World like Pillars is a work of fiction, not a history book. Moreover I certainly didn't feel that World was overdone with sexual scenes as others have commented about in prior reviews.  Reading World I found the ups and downs, twists and turns, chicanery, duplicity, violence, passions and blood-shed to be every bit the equal of Pillars and perhaps better in places. I felt that World was as focused as Pillars with a unifying theme. Like Pillars there was indeed a mystery that was presented toward the beginning of World that was finally resolved at the end.  So if you liked Pillars you will probably like World just as much. I know I did.    I guess because I liked World and gave it 5 stars, I can't be considered a serious critic.  Oh well!    Happy reading.
0446677450|1.0|This book has some pretty interesting stories, but nothing you can really use to get wealthy yourself.  It seems like the author just thought of 5 or 6 catchphrases and repeated them over and over without really telling you how to make them work.  They might be good in theory, but he does not show you how to apply them to your life.    Whether or not the stories in here are true, you won't be able to use them as examples, because the circumstances were so rare and specific that you'll never have the opportunity.    If you want to read some interesting stories on how one person made money, it's an ok book.  But if you want actual advice on how to get there yourself, it seems like the only lesson is to create an overhyped book and convince other people to buy it
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I'm sure the critics will hate it, but I loved the series and loved the opportunity to see the team in action again. I can't wait until the next movie. Maybe if these sell well, they might resurrect the series. Again.
0060595183|5.0|Fantastic piece of art, Huxley's documentation of this \\"trip\\" explores the workings of the mind, a must read for anyone interested in the acid/peyote culture. Great deal for two classic pieces.
0307237702|5.0|Interesting read, very intimate and down to earth, open.  I felt I connected to Obama. Highly recommended.
B000ZLFALI|5.0|I really don't know exactly where to begin with this movie review.  Most of you are fed up and tired with my reviews of horror films that deal with extreme violence.  This review is the complete and exact opposite...a film of love...a film encased within the hearts of many people (my age) that truly enjoyed the \\"love\\" generation.       \\"Across the Universe\\" has moved into my TOP THREE films of all time.  Immediately after I finished it, I wanted to see it again...much like my fever for \\"Jurassic Park\\" and something much more endearing as \\"When Harry Met Sally\\".  What's the comparison?       \\"Across the Universe\\" is a visual anthology of everything that the legendary Beatles stood for.  Not within their crazy and bizarre real lives, but within the tone and realism of what their words and music stood for.       I'd like to deem this movie a musical, but it goes far beyond that.  It is a love story of \\"Titanic\\" proportions, and a film that tugs at your emotions from start to finish...ONLY if you have ever been in love...yearned for love...lost your love...perhaps never really understood what love is all about.       Bear with me.  I need to be clear and explicit with this review, my buds.  This film is one of, if not the best, I have ever seen.       In a nutshell, the pure love and innocence of The Beatles music and lyrics are put into action in this incredibly romantic vision of love...love...love.       I took notes as the film unfolded.  Here are some of my notes:     \\"Coming from a movie maniac like me, when I say this is one of the best movies ever produced, please hear me out.\\"     \\"This is a tribute to The Beatles...their music and their message within the music...put to action in a priceless...moving...portrayal...by committed and caring Beatlemaniacs...like me.\\"     \\"I loved the classic films such as Jurassic Park, Forrest Gump, and Silence of the Lambs.  Across the Universe takes you back to reality...the turbulent Sixties...the tearful times when we lost lives in senseless combat...searching for love in all the RIGHT places...not fearful of crying...women or men.\\"     \\"How can you take 40-plus Beatles' love songs and not tug at the strings of your heart?\\"     \\"If you don't cry in at least 10 different scenes, I question the devotion of your heart.\\"     \\"This is a beautiful love story of the Sixties...with incredible visuals that define The Beatles' music, message, and purpose in life.\\"     \\"If you only watch the scene where the song \\"I Want You...She's So Heavy\\" is so masterfully visualized, you'll get your money's worth.\\"       But it doesn't end there.     \\"This film is an anthology of our times/lives from 1963 to 1973...a decade of love, peace and protest.  This film explains it all.  If you have ever loved from your heart, buckle your seatbelts and fathom this epic.\\"       \\"Can a movie tug at your heart for two hours?  Yes.  This one does.  Tears, hope, joy and sadness.  This one took me home my Buds.  My life was revisited in 120 minutes...as a veteran of the U.S. Army...a young man in love...an old man in love...all of my love...revisited by the melodic sounds of The Beatles.\\"       \\"The Beatles launched their career with epic love songs.  Enjoy them and the cast as they live within the lyrics.\\"     This movie is beautiful...profound...exhilarating.  There's something in the way it moves...it has  strawberry fields forever...and your guitar will gently weep.  It gives you All My Loving...and demands a response to the question...If I Fell.  Oh Darling...there's no room for Helter Skelter or a Revolution, but Lucy's Sky with Diamonds will send you on a journey ACROSS THE UNIVERSE that only true Beatle fans will ever understand.  Take the journey.     This one, on a scale of 1-10...gets a solid TWENTY!     Bottom line...ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE...LOVE IS ALL YOU NEED!       No...I'm not pulling your leg.  This is one of the best films I have ever experienced.  It will live within my heart forever, because it representsso many things that are important to my/your generation....LOVE...LOVE.  That's all we need...the box
B0012K1ILW|1.0|If you liked her previous work, don't even think about it. I liked her so much I saw her live in Phoenix, AZ several years ago. From this new cd--you won't even recognize that this is Ms. Badu. Her lyrics are shallow. There isn't a beat you can feel on any song. If you like noise and the feeling like you are at a drunken backyard garage band rehearsal...then buy it. Know that it pains me to write this.  Signed, a former fan, hoping for a REAL Badu comeback.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|Great cinematography, so I don't mind the one star I'm forced to give it.<br /><br />Other than that, this movie is pretty much a train wreck. Daniel Day-Lewis spends the whole movie doing a John Huston imitation, as others have noted and is frankly impossible to ignore.<br /><br />The music track sounds like it was written by the Marquis de Sade, with screeching violins making me want to level my 12 gauge shotgun at my speakers.<br /><br />The script itself was a lame attempt to take muckraker/socialist Upton Sinclair's novel \\"Oil\\" and couch it in a contemporary \\"morality\\", with major story revisions. A dismal failure on all counts, unless you're a die hard socialist, in which case it may resonate.<br /><br />Essentially a series of mini-stories with continuing characters, fairly incoherently strung together, to carry the characters through a few decades to an ultimately senseless finale. Story lines are left incomplete, characters vanish into the ether.... just basically a mess.<br /><br />Other than the cinematography, as I noted earlier, this movie has absolutely nothing going for it.<br /><br />Wow! It won an Oscar! Quite a statement on the politicization of Hollyweird, I have to say.
B0013D8LOK|5.0|When ordering this movie, I thought I probably would not like it due to the subject matter.  I like musicals, so no problem there.... slasher / musical?????  I thought too weird.  This turned out to be the best movie I have seen in a long time and I was entertained through it all.  Johnny Depp IS Sweeney Todd.  This was the best part yet that I have seen him in and I feel he can write his own ticket after this one!!!!  Fantasic job.  Helena Bonham Carter had a great part too.  Too bad that most people won't even watch it and give this movie a chance because of all the spirting blood... again, too bad.  Loved it, loved it!!!!
0786838655|5.0|This book held the attention of my whole family!! The kids loved it so much they asked to go to the Art Institute and see Greek stuff... then they wanted to eat Greek food.  It's a GREAT book! Page turner...
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The Ark of Truth wraps up many of the unanswered questions left from the Ori story line.  The movie is the same high quality you would expect from a Stargate SG-1 episode, only at feature length and without commercials.  We have the DVD set for every Stargate season.  We were very pleased with The Ark of Truth, and we can't wait for the next DVD to be released.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|Nice visual job; clearly for fans like me who enjoy the storyline. Overdid the music, though.
B00133GYRG|4.0|Goodbye Bafana is a riveting tale of a South African White prison guard assigned to spy upon Nelson Mandela during his long[over 20 year] imprisonment.  It is not only historically accurate but is a moving tale of the sillyness of bigotry solely based upon race.
B000W9DTG6|3.0|This is a great boxset for fans of the Oceans Trilogy. Complete with all the 3 parts, this makes an excellent addition to my collection. I would say there is not many additional features or so that may impress me tremendously.    Most importantly, there is value for money.
076790592X|5.0|This would be one book that is must read for all educators or anyone that has been influenced in a positive way by an educator.  It is one of my all-time favorites.
1591841992|1.0|I was really looking forward to reading this book and using it as a resource for helping me solve many of my everyday business issues.  I very disappointed.  The book does describe a very simplistic view.  However, the process lacks any depth to be useful in my work.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|Another haunting, hilarious masterpeice from Cave and the Bad Seeds.  Rich, textured, and complex, this album offers hours of fun, literary references, and songs to make love or revolutions to.  Spooky and seductive, Nick's turn with the Grinderman crew has smoothed out some edges and roughed others up in exciting ways.  It's so inspiring to watch a natural genius like Cave not only survive but thrive and mature.  This record makes me want to say to every 20 and 30-something rock-star \\"THIS is how it's done!\\"
B0013D8LOU|4.0|I first saw Sweeney Todd at the Davis Musical Theatre Company, mid to late eighties, completely unprepared for the marvelous assault that is Sondheim's best musical.  This version, while of necessity hacking away much of the music, hews closely (yes, I intend hacking and hewing in the same sentence) to the story and does sufficient honor to this amazing score. Would I have preferred better singers? Of course. But the acting, the effects, all else make up for that, and marvelous alternatives exist on DVD for theatrical purists.  Bravo to all involved!
B000KX0IOK|1.0|My husband and I are in our 40s and not hard of hearing, but we couldn't understand a word that Shareeka Epps said.  The rest of the movie seemed to be nothing more then Ryan Gosling getting wasted, trying to sleep it off, and dragging through the rest of his workday.  Talk about overrated!
0393324818|5.0|This was just a terrific book, putting an incredibly human face on a game and a financial analysis of success.
B000002H6C|5.0|I would first like to get the bad out of the way, the production.  It does not give mush credit to lars drums pounding wise.  With that out of the way I want everyone to know how great of an album this is.  Whenever you start and album off with a song like blackened you know that this is going to be one of the greatest albums ever.  The album itself is long with only TWO songs under SIX minutes!  But the songs never get boring (except at the ninth minute of the title track) and with all the extreme music going on you will no doubt be entertained.  This is also metallicas compositional masterpiece.  Every song has the greatest musicianship of any album EVER!
B0010ZR160|5.0|The moment the first note of the theme song came up on the screen, the moment this film started, tears started to fill my eyes... I knew that the directorial debut by Ben Affleck, \\"Gone Baby Gone, was going to be a Great Film. All you had to do was LISTEN. All you have to do is HEAR. You will be transported from the land of the living to the land of innocence lost and long gone and the longing for what we knew long ago and far away... it's that place we all know and long to return to that doesn't have a name.<br /><br />You don't even have to watch the screen, even though you wouldn't want to miss a frame... This gorgeous, touching, heartbreaking soundtrack by Harry Gregson-Williams follows every fast-paced twist and turn down the rushing river that takes us on this tale of \\"right and wrong.\\"<br /><br />The story is heartbreaking morality play, about the choices that we find that we must make, even when we don't want to take a side, and none of them seem right. The musical score by Harry Gregson-Williams perfectly sets the stage.<br /><br />You could be a blind person and not have to watch a frame; just sit and listen and you would know the tale of love, longing and loss, and right and wrong and how we sometimes try to do our best. This is one of the best film and soundtrack I've heard and watched in a long, long time.<br />* * * * *
B000NDIAWY|5.0|Some of the best music I've ever heard (and since I'm 63 and a music \\"nut\\" that includes A LOT of music of all kinds.)  I'm not into reviewing in terms of discussing different tracks, how it compares to previous work or work of others, etc, but I'm simply predicting some kind of Grammy recognition for this fantastic music by Brandi and the Twins.  My vote is for Album of the Year.
081541028X|5.0|The best (and one of the earliest) book by an Apollo astronaut. Very witty, with candid appraisals of other astronauts. Actually written by the astronaut himself. A must for anyone interested in the Apollo program.
B000PKG6TE|5.0|So the fans have spoken and proclaimed this album \\"no good.\\" I think a lot of people need to go out and get their heads examined. I ignored this release for awhile because fellow Queens fans had scoffed at it. One friend of mine even called it, \\"complete garbage.\\"    Well, one day I was out shopping for new CDs and curiousity got the better of me. I popped this CD in and took a listen. This is not the black sheep of the Queens of the Stone Age catalogue. This is an excellent album, maybe even their best.     Casual fans embraced Songs For the Deaf, but perhaps did not flock to the next disc due to the absense of Dave Grohl. Grohl is a great musician, but he isn't the man the made Deaf a great record. Josh Homme is, and always has been, the master mind behind everything Queens of the Stone Age has done. If anything, the aforementioned album is overrated and this one is underrated. SFtD is a good album featuring some of the band's best known tracks (especially \\"No One Know\\"), and does get off to a more immediately powerful start than this one, but there are also points where that album drags a bit. Not the case with this one. While there are still many highlights (\\"I'm Designer\\", \\"Make It Wit Chu\\", \\"3's & 7's\\"), the album runs very well as a whole and doesn't overstay it's welcome. Add to that the fact that good hard rock is pretty tough to find these days and this album has to be considered one of the few must buys of 2007. Don't hesitate. Pick this one up.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|The depth of talent in Angelina Jolie, is exhibited more in this movie, than any other I've seen her in...She is a great actress.
B00000J2PH|5.0|Carole King-Tapestry *****<br /><br />With the release of Tapestry King transformed herself from just a songwriter to a full musical artist. King was, along with her then husband, two of the most important songwriters of the 1960's, especially for all those girl groups. But one day after talking to her very good friend James Taylor he had told her to record some of her own stuff since she really had a beautiful voice. King then began recording Tapestry and Taylor's Sweet Baby James at the same time, in the same studio.<br /><br />King's vocals are amazing on this record, and as previously mentioned so are her lyrics, as she had a knack for writing fantastic ones. 'Will You Still Love Me Tomorrow' was a song that she had written and had become a hit for the girl group The Shirelles in 1961. She slowed this track down and recorded her vocals recording what I consider to be the definitive version. Turning on the melancholy ten fold with the heart breaking 'It's Too Late.' But not all is sad, the hooky yet fun 'Smack-water Jack' and the earthly joy of 'I Feel The Earth Move' liven up the album.<br /><br />Tapestry is in my opinion THE singer/songwriter album of all time. Not before or since was anyone able to come close to the power of this album. For me this is about the only singer/songwriter album from the 1970's that doesn't have a big layer of cheese in the mix.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|How sad to have lost one of the greatest actors of all time. Charlton Heston will live forever in the hearts of his fans thanks to the magnificent roles he played in the films that you can really call true spectacles. \\"EL CID\\" is only one of the many great films he made and one I am truly happy to own but sad for his recent passing. HOLLYWOOD JUST DOES NOT MAKE GREAT MOVIES LIKE \\"EL CID\\" ANYMORE AND THE CALIBER OF TRUE \\"A\\" LIST ACTORS LIKE CHARLTON HESTON AND SOPHIA LOREN ARE RARE TO WATCH THESE DAYS. LONG LIVE CHARLTON HESTON AS EL CID, MOSES AND BEN-HUR!!!![[ASIN:B0009UZG1O Ben-Hur (Four-Disc Collector's Edition)]]
B000002KLP|5.0|Prince-Dirty Mind *****<br /><br />During Prince's career he would release about four or five really classic albums and Dirty Mind was certainly the first. Released in 1980 this was really a template for the rest of the decade to follow. An album of excess' like drugs, sex, and synthesizers respectively.<br /><br />Whether it's the hit singles; The teenage libido driven title track 'Dirty Mind,' the raunchy yet danceable 'Head' the incredibly funky 'Uptown' and of course the nostalgic 'When You Were Mine' all rank among the artists greatest songs. Aside from the hits 'Do It All Night' and 'Gotta A Broken Heart' find him finally mastering the art of the ballad. 'Sister' is just done right shocking, and being as it's Prince it somehow makes it okay, though this was his first attempt at shock. The albums closer 'Partyup' is sheer fun, and a great way to close the masterpiece.<br /><br />Even though it was officially his third album, Dirty Mind was his break out album, not quite the amount of success as his next release would earn but this one definitely put him on the map.
B0014DBZT2|5.0|There are a few songwriters who have taken the English language and crafted it into something entirely different.  A brief list of some of my favorite songwriters comes to mind: Kris Kristofferson, Tom Waits, Hank Williams, Jackson Browne, Bob Dylan, and perhaps Sting (somebody, somewhere, is arguing these last two; too bad, this is MY review, and I stand by it).  This list isn't anywhere near complete, of course, but it serves to give you an example of the category we should file Nick Cave into.  If, of course, you can put him in one simple category (I don't recommend wasting your time trying to do this).<br /><br />With Nick Cave, of course, it isn't just about the lyrics.  A Nick Cave record is an aural experience--a delight the which you've only dreamed of.  This is thanks in large part to the rest of the Bad Seeds, expert musicians who specialize in f***ing things up (in a good way).  Take, for instance, the title track here, with Cave bellowing \\"I want you to dig!\\" over pounding electric guitars.  Or the metafictional songwriting forray \\"We Call Upon the Author,\\" with the enduring chant: \\"Prolix, prolix, nothing a pair of scissors can't fix!\\"  Or the groove of the Odyssean epic \\"More News from Nowhere.\\"  Or the gentle, romantic sway of \\"Jesus of the Moon.\\"<br /><br />Basically, DIG, LAZARUS, DIG!!! picks up where the Grinderman project left off, this time with ALL of the Bad Seeds contributing.  It's nice to see Cave rocking the f*** out again (am I cursing too much?).  There really isn't much of a title for music like this; I think \\"rock\\" comes closest to it.  If you aren't familiar with Nick Cave: I'm not sure how you wound up here...but buy the record and see what you've been missing.  If you're a longtime fan, or a recent one, then I'm not sure why you're actually reading this, but you, too, should buy the record.  Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds are one of the most interesting things the music world has to offer us nowadays; in this world of fake celebrities and Pro-Tools and reality-show singers, it's nice to see a guy who just doesn't give a rat's petoot about doing anything other than making music HIS way.  Here's to Nick Cave & The Bad Seeds, for helping to keep this thing we call art honest and sincere.reality-show singers, it's nice to see a guy who just doesn't give a rat's petoot about doing anything other than making music HIS way.

B000002KBU|5.0|Joni Mitchell-Blue *****<br /><br />Joni is an acquired taste, their is no way around it. But with her being an acquired taste how is then that she is essential. It's a head scratcher. But the fact is, some people cannot stand the lady's voice, which is sad because it truly is a beautiful and unique voice. But the truth is people either hate it or love, there is no middle ground. But this, her 1971 masterpiece Blue, is easily one of the greatest and most important albums of all time. Along side Carole King's Tapestry are the two single greatest singer/songwriter albums of all time. While James Taylor and Stephen Stills may have lent hands to some of the material Blue is mainly a lonely melancholy album both literally and figuratively.<br /><br />This may be the greatest break-up album of all time. Songs like 'California' 'Carey' and 'This Flight Tonight' show a vulnerability of Joni that we never saw before and that she would never come close to again. She was quoted as saying when she recorded and wrote this album she felt as transparent as cellophane, for the whole world to see everything, and that really comes across in the music. Even her wonderfully underrated guitar playing sounds tortured.<br /><br />Yes Joni would go on to make more ambitious albums, and albums that would sell far more copies then Blue, but the simple fact is that as a whole, Joni would never, ever make another album that would even come close to the power of Blue. Essential
0385338082|4.0|It's another light read from Kinsella. And it kept me interested and turned the page for hours, just like the shopaholic collection. But sometimes, things have gone way too far, like...how can Emma let Jemima went so far?! Afterall, I would give it a 4-star since there's no bored moments throughout the book.
B0010V4TZU|5.0|VW has produced what I consider to be a different style with their blending of different instruments. I have a very eclectic taste in music and this one really peaks my interest with its uniqueness. People who have dissed this CD have clearly missed the point--don't listen to them, listen instead to VW on their MySpace site and decide for yourself.
B00000JTB2|5.0|As a huge chicago blues fan, and a even greater SRV fan, you truely get the best of both worlds. With the hundreds of blues cd, that I own, spanning from leadbelly to keb'mo, this cd holds a special place in my heart. This cd comes out just as SRV'S texas flood is released, and the rest they say is HISTORY. Every track on this cd ROCKS!!! A must for any true blues fan, and in my opinion, One of the top 5 cd for people new to the blues to start with. You will not be dissapointed, you will become an instant lover of the blues!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Although the last episode of SG-1 (Unending) was a really good one, it did leave a lot open.  The Ark of Truth movie took care of the loose ends.  I really enjoyed it and I can't wait for Millenium to come out later this year.  I love SG-1 and I will miss watching it every week.
B00102FELM|4.0|[[ASIN:B00102FELM Scorpions: Live at Wacken Open Air 2006]]  After I have purchased and watched this DVD I realized why the title of the DVD is chosen to be \\"A Night to Remember\\".  I imagine that for everyone that was on the audience for this concert, this was indeed a night to remember.  This concert took me back to the 80s when the Scorps were at their peak.  The concert is much similar to the \\"World Wide Live\\" recording in both the set list but also the band's performance.  It is admirable to see this band after almost 40 years on stage, still having such power, and such freshness in their performance.  I believe that the fact that James and Pavel brought the new blood into the band contributed to this.  Rudi and Mat are at their best, while Klaus's voice that was not very strong in the beginning of the concert, warmed up fast enough to deliver the great performance.  What to say about the guest, but simply outstanding.  Roth's playing took us back to the 70s and \\"Tokyo Tapes recording\\".  We were all nostalgic to see and hear those great songs again.  The energy that the band showed on the stage of the Wacken Festival is simply amazing. There are not too many bands today that have capabilities of producing such energy throughout two hours of the concert.  Let's not forget, Scorps are not young anymore, they are one of the veterans of today's world rock scene.  The set list is outstanding.  Scorpions have played all of their best hits over the years.  This DVD is a must have not only for the true fans of the Scorpions, but it is also a must have for any fan of the good rock music.  The reason why I am not rating this product with all five starts is because there is no bonus material to it (I would hope to see at least an interview with all band members to include the guest).  Another reason for giving this product only 4 stars is that the DVD cover was very cheaply made and the booklet is already torn from the cover. But this is secondary.  The primary reason forwhat you are going to by this product is because of the concert.  And that is outstanding, purely 5 star performance.
B0010V4TZU|4.0|Eclectic mix of great sounds including some unique orchestral backgrounds. Lots of \\"east coast hip\\" and club allure. You can't help but fall in love with the violins in the mix. Awesome new band!
B00003CXRM|5.0|I have always been a Coen Brothers fan. I was hooked when I saw \\"Blood Simple\\" in the theater. While I liked \\"No Country for Old Men,\\" I keep coming back to \\"O Brother...\\" as my favorite. The soundtrack, the imagery, and the characters are exquisite. Many people refer to the Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" as the main filmic reference this movie. While that is true to a large extent, \\"O Brother...\\" is also an homage to Americana. And it's not only the music. From references to Busby Berkeley (the men on the chain gang as the movie opens move in syncopated rhythm like the swimmers and dancer of the early Berkely films), to the \\"Wizard of Oz,\\"  Chris Thomas King's \\"Robert Johnson-like\\" character who sold his soul to the devil at the cross-roads to learn to play guitar, to the James Agee and Walker Evans Depression Era photography, \\"O Brother...\\" is a gorgeous culmination of over 100 years of American filmmaking.
B0013BNY2Q|1.0|[...] This is the second cd I bought this week that sounds like the recording mastering was done by monkeys. The other was the Breeders Mountain Battles. Why must good songs be ruined by sound that is unbearable? I find myself listening to this cd very quietly after MUCH EQ fiddling.  Its like the cd is daring me to jam out to the amazing songs but when I do I get punished with eardrum shattering distortion. How can some bands let the record companies turn their art into 35 minute sonic crap sandwiches? Man I thought REM would know better. Shame on all the bands and labels lately trying to swindle us with these cost cutting 35 minute recordings and LOUDER is better mastering. REM needs to add a few tracks to this cd and remaster it!
B00104QSOM|4.0|Part of me was not looking forward to \\"There Will Be Blood\\", the latest from Paul Thomas Anderson who did \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Magnolia\\". Part of it is that a lot of times the films come across as slightly pretentious; as if the film is genuinely a classic right out of the gate and anyone who says otherwise just doesn't know movies or hasn't seen it enough to fully appreciate it. However, I will admit the guy does have filmmaking talent and screenplay-wise, he writes very sharply and even in complex matters and with his latest, you can see that there is a solid filmmaker underneath here and indeed many were calling the film the best of 2007, but after 3 viewings, I still think there's promise but not a fully realized film here.    The film takes place in the late 19th/20th century where self-made oilman Daniel Plainview has been going from place to place making promises and drilling in the ground for lucrative and money-making oil deposits. With his adoptive son, H.W., Daniel is quite ambitious and committed to his successes and amassing of wealth so when Paul Sunday of the town of Little Boston arrives with talks of an untapped oil deposit, Daniel and his son head down there only to find a problem in Eli Sunday, Paul's brother, who can sell and promote his church just as well as Daniel's love for oil and money.    I recently saw Magnolia again, which was a film on first viewing I didn't really care for, but deciding to revisit it, I thought I'd at least give it another shot and while it still had its problems, I liked it slightly more. The same thing happened with this film where its pacing and length problems weren't as glaring and it's lack of a compelling narrative wasn't as troublesome. Ultimately, the film is more a character study than anything as we see a character get more demanding, oppressive and quite foregone. The comparisons to \\"Citizen Kane\\" are well founded and while the film did keep me interesting, there were other times where I felt it wasn't as compelling as it should've been.    Every year there tends to be one of those performances where it's kind of obvious they're going to win so it was without shock that Daniel Day-Lewis won, who's utterly convincing and explosive who's quite comfortable slipping into his darker half. We have Paul Dano who holds his own despite the age difference (although his choking cat impression during a sermon is unintentionally funny, as well as Day-Lewis' \\"drainage!\\" line). Aside from H.W., and a role by Kevin J. O'Connor who's best known for comedic roles in \\"the Mummy\\" and \\"Deep Rising\\", everyone is kind of set dressing.    Where the film stumbles a bit is in its score. Nothing wrong with it and some scenes work quite well but there's one sound, an irritating crescendo dissonance that opens the film and re-appears, is grating and in other scenes it doesn't quite match up. Then there's the ending scene which takes place in, of all places, a bowling alley, with unintentionally funny parts and a weird use of the word \\"milkshake\\". A subplot is needed for story and character but it still extends its length to dragging levels. But then its near-wordless opening sequence, a spectacular setpiece involving a derrick fire and Day-Lewis' performance keep you interested.    Its less-than-stellar assortments of goodies aside, There Will Be Blood is indeed a worthy watch, however, I'm not going to call it an outright masterpiece because everyone says it is.

B000I2IT44|5.0|Buy it and share it with everyone you know. This band should be HUGE! On the extras, Cymbal Song is very cool and unique.
B000WTNCYA|4.0|Very interesting pure voice that is a throwback to the 50s with lots of extras.
B0007XT87G|5.0|This album is a masterpiece. It's really rare to find a band like this in this day & age. There is so much crap out there now. A band that makes it on talent alone. No MTV no radio play. It's like it used to be. Word of mouth and live shows. Check out all of their work, you won't be dissapointed. Spend some time with their music and let it grow on you. Really good stuff.
B0013FXWU6|1.0|I purchased the single-disc version of this film, so I cannot comment on the collector's edition.<br /><br />I have to say, I think this movie is spectacular, so I have nothing to add as far as that goes.  However, this is the single worst packaging of a DVD I have ever seen.  I don't object so much to the fact that it is in a cheap cardboard case, but more to the fact that, by simply taking the disc out of that case, the DVD was seriously scratched.  A space as large as my thumb is now completely scratched, and I have not even watched the movie as of yet.  Simply put, there is no way that I will be able to watch this movie more than once (which is the point of buying the movie, rather than renting it) without eventually damaging it too much to watch it.<br /><br />I did not pay $16 for a package that will eventually require that I purchase the movie a second time.  It's going back to the store tomorrow.

They have such an impressive catalog. Great dual guitar sound, great drummer, great songwriting. Faves are this album, Live & Dangerous, and Johnny The Fox.

Anything Nuno is involved with is worth having. One of the truly great guitarists. Cupid's Dead is worth the cd but there are many other tasty & meaningful tunes here. Buy this and Pornograffiti.
B0010X745K|1.0|This could have been one of the greats. The story is suspenseful and atmospheric and the action is wonderful.  Some of the characters actions are debatable, but this is a fantasy movie, don't look too much into them.  However, the movie only gets 1 star because the ENDING SUCKED!!!!!!!!!! The whole movie followed King's short novella perfectly until the Jackass 'powers that be' changed the ending and ruined everything. The whole movie was exactly like the book except for that. Please watch the 1st 90% of the movie, save yourself anguish and turn it off, and then read the novella.
B00104QSOM|2.0|The movie itself is great, but provided you don't scratch it while removing it from the luxurious cardboard slip case, you'll just crush the flimsy outer cardboard case it comes in. Really just detracts so much from the movie. For the price you would think the packaging would be substantially better.

B0007LCNKM|5.0|\\"I need some meaning I can memorize,\\" Bright Eyes' Conor Oberst once sang. It was a great lyric about a universal need--the need to not just find meaning in this complicated world, but to reduce that meaning into simple truths we can take with us everywhere. And this exquisite album by The National sounds like it was tailor-made to fill that bill. In fact, these songs aren't just memorizable--they're unforgettable.<br /><br />First, a little note. By my reckoning, there are two types of music lovers: horn people and string people. Horn people can listen to string music, and vice versa, and large swaths of music have neither instrument, but everyone has a preference between the two. For the most part, horns are happy, upbeat daytime instruments. They do some mournful songs, but it's not an everyday thing. And so horn people are bright and full of sunshine, and they get married and live in the suburbs and have 2.3 kids and are always in bed by 10.<br /><br />This is a string person's album.<br /><br />But it's far more than that. \\"Alligator\\" is one of the most listenable and captivating and sadly underappreciated albums to come our way since the turn of the millennium. It's an album with a lot to say about our loves and lives and lies. If you're anything like me, you'll listen to it a lot, and the more you listen to it, the more you want to listen to it. And you'll save it for after nightfall, for it's one of those lonely, staring-out-your-window-at-the-night-streets albums.<br /><br />You can trust this album, because it's honest with its feelings, and because it's consistent in the best possible sense--not the I-don't-have-a-lot-of-ideas sense, but the everything's-in-its-right-place sense. Some of the songs are slow and sad, but even the up-tempo ones aren't happy; they are just full of urgency and immediacy to counter the smoky languor elsewhere. The guitars are sometimes charged and sometimes mellow, the strings are sorrowful, and everything swirls together beautifully. And floating half-submerged through the mix, we hear Matt Berninger's wonderful baritone, always sounding as if it's either drowning in drink or spewing it out in anger. It's a perfect voice for this music, sadder than the strings, lonelier than the walk of shame.<br /><br />Some people sing to the masses; Berninger's singing for an audience of one. You. Actually, it's not so much you, the listener, as it is \\"you.\\" You the significant other, you the ex, you the best friend and betrayer, you the member of a relationship so important it rarely needs proper nouns. He does name names, here and there--Karen, John, Val Jester, Abel--but in a sense they don't matter. \\"You're the low life of the party,\\" he sings on \\"Lit Up\\", and you don't know if he's singing at you or singing your thoughts, but it works either way, because if you're anything like me, you've lived these songs as the singer, or the singee, or both, and you can play your mental Mad Libs and fill in your own names as needed.<br /><br />Still, one senses this is a deeply personal album. \\"Yeah say something perfect, something I can steal,\\" Berninger sings on \\"Baby We'll Be Fine,\\" and you know (or at least I know, because I spent years quoting my friends and lovers and presenting it as fiction) that's the line of an artist who is literally putting all of himself into his work. There are plenty of stellar moments on this album, but that song highlights what's best about this band. In it, Berninger chants \\"I'm so sorry for everything,\\" over and over, so often you end up thinking the guy must be Catholic. The specific meaning's enigmatic, but the effect is still hypnotic; these are the mantras we tell others, and tell ourselves, to make this complicated world make sense.ged through the mix, we hear Matt Berninger's wonderful baritone, always sounding as if it's either drowning in drink or spewing it out in anger.

Nothing in his material contradicts the course and yet he adds a dimension that will blow your mind.

Don't get me wrong I find the course very powerful, but Tolle is here and now. He is practical and explains enlightenment and how to get there on such a fundamental level you have to love it. What a one two punch.
1593082649|5.0|This excellent first novel by Jane Austen is a must read for Austen fans. Although this novel was the last to be published, Northanger Abbey was the first story she wrote. This first attempt is raw, emotionally driven, and shows the passion of a first time writer. The story is one of mystery, intrigue, and a match made in heaven... that is of course dependent on if society will allow it.     From the balls in Bath to the secrets of Northanger Abbey Catherine Morland lives it all. Her youth and proper upbringing give Catherine the innocence and naiveté that everyone can't help but love in her character. Her truly good-hearted personality allows her to be liked where ever she goes. Catherine, it should also be noted, is a fan of gothic novels and is intrigued by the mysteries and secrets they hold. While on vacation with her wealthy neighbors the Allens, Catherine for the first time gets to experience the society in Bath. There she meets the amiable Mr. John Thorpe and the witty Mr. Henry Tilney. When Catherine is invited to the Tilney's Northanger Abbey, her imagination and the grandeur of Northanger Abbey takes hold of her as she tries to discover the truth behind the death of Mrs. Tilney (Henry's mother).    \\"Dear Miss Morland, consider the dreadful nature of the suspicions you have entertained. What have you been judging from? Remember the country and the age in which we live. Remember that we are English: that we are Christians. Consult your own understanding, your own sense of the probable, your own observation of what is passing around you. Does our education prepare us for such atrocities? Do our laws connive at them? Could they be perpetuated without being known in a country like this, where social and literary intercourse is on such a footing, where every man is surrounded by a neighborhood of voluntary spies, and where roads and newspapers lay everything open? Dearest Miss Morland, what ideas have you been admitting?\\" - Henry Tilney

B00104QSOM|5.0|I will not get into detail about the film (rated FIVE STARS), as there are many great reviews here and they all hit it on the spot about how incredible it is. My concern is with the HORRIBLE packaging that Paramount decided to use with the release of this beautifully haunting film.  How does this get by the marketing reps? How does a mistake like this get by ANYONE? This release seems rushed and poor and Paramount should invest more time and money in preparing an ultimate edition, an edition that will prove worthy of the money spent by DVD collectors.  As mentioned with most other reviews of the packaging, the disc was easily scratched when I tried to take it out and I even bent the sleeve with how careful I was trying to be. I have already contacted Viacom (who owns Paramount) in hopes of having them release the film again with different packaging (and possibly get the film with the new packaging).

B0004Z33EG|5.0|(Review by T. Buchanan- Film Freak)    In 1982, Stallone had two huge hits come out in the same year: Rocky III and First Blood. At the time, nobody remembered the 1972 book about a Vietnam Vet named John J. Rambo. After this film was released, however, everybody in the world would know all about Rambo. It would also create the string of sequels that continue until today. Unlike Rocky, Rambo is a tortured soul who loves his country, but is disillusioned and scarred. From the opening scene, Rambo's heart is broken after learning of his war buddy's death by Agent Orange. This is the beginning of Rambo's rampage and it is Sheriff Teasle ( Brian Dennehy, playing the bully as nobody else can) that sets him off. Say what you will about Stallone's acting ability. In this film all you have to do is look at his face to see that America has turned its back on him and spat in his face. We feel for his character immediately. We cheer when he beats the crap out of the redneck deputies. We cheer when he plows through the squad car blockcade. We cry with him at the end when Rambo opens up to Col. Troutman (Richard Crenna) the only friend he has left in the world. Not many of today's so called actors can do that. Look for some notable acting debuts as well from a very young David Caruso ( CSI: Miami and NYPD Blue). Stallone's films have always been the target of the critics who claimed they were \\"too violent.\\"  Actually, this film would probably get a PG rating today. The sequels were much more bloody. The only criticisms I have for this movie would be that Richard Crenna probably graduated from the William Shatner acting school. He's a bit wooden, and the entire movie was shot in Canada, not Washington state. The rest is a very entertaining film from start to finish. Make sure you get the widescreen 'Ultimate' edition. This one has Stallone's commentary and the alternate ending which would have made a sequel impossible. Outstanding direction by Ted Kocheff.

B0010YSD7M|4.0|I really didn't expect much from this movie - from the previews it looked a bit like a Daniel love-in - but it was very entertaining.  Teal'c got more screen time than usual, which was a treat, and the movie hit a nice balance between wrapping up the loose ends of the series and keeping the team dynamic moving forward.  The music was just terrific and the effects great but not so big that they overshadowed the story.  My one nit-pick is that Sam didn't have as much of a role as I would have liked, but on the whole I think the balance was good - I love Vala and Cam and thought they were served well without neglecting the rest of the team.<br /><br />Note to folks who aren't as familiar with the series - you'll DEFINITELY want to watch the introductory material so you can figure out what's going on.  It flows nicely into the main movie - a little better than a 'Previously On' but not too expository.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|It was a great movie until the last; it seemed to fizzle at the end.

B000HIVOI2|4.0|There's not much else here. You get a commentary from the director and that's about it. You'd think that the bluray release of a movie that spawned a huge franchise (which I'm not really into,sorry) consisting of more than one type of show on the sci-fi channel would have some special features. Give me Something.   But besides that the movie looks great. I mean they probably never expected there to be defintion this good because if you watch it on bluray there is a scene (no lie) that you can see the film crew in the reflection of one of the soldiers sunglasses!!! And it's not a close up shot! Thats why I said they probably never even dream that that would be a problem. When they watched things back in editing they probably never even noticed it! HD is great.   So, overall its a good movie and a great collection for bluray but there's not much as far as extras to keep the disc in for long

B000ASATYO|3.0|Having never seen \\"The Frighteners\\" in the theatre, and now seeing Peter Jackson's Director's Cut makes me wonder why such a cut was released?  This film, with all of it's slick special effects and Alan Silvestri-Knock-off-music by Danny Elfman, goes on and on and on without being truly funny (the endless one-liners are as old and corny as can be!) or truly scary; in short, the film is probably best described as campy with an overuse of effects and no focus on acting.  If Trini Alvarado was meant to be bad, then this Andie MacDowell knock-off WAS every bit as numbing as her more famous look-alike.  Michael J. Fox was not funny at all, and the endless barrage of ectoplasm and spirits and a Dee Wallace Stone in her finest role since [[ASIN:B000T5O48U Cujo (25th Anniversary Edition)]], made this film pretty tough to stomach.  Glad to see that Peter Jackson did better work before AND after this one!  Why a Director's Cut, though?  Wasn't the theatrical release silly enough?
0143038419|4.0|A \\"travelogue/self-discovery story\\" as the author visits Italy, India, and Bali. I listened to the audio version, read by the author, and can describe the book as light, \\"chick-lit\\". It reminded me of being talked to by an entertaining acquaintance who very much enjoys talking about herself and her experiences. It was pleasant, easy listening and if your mind wanders for a minute, you will probably not miss anything life changing nor lessen your understanding of the book. I believe this book will be very popular because many women will be able to identify with various feelings and general experiences the author describes. She DOES have a way with words. I would recommend this book as an easy, entertaining read for women. That said, I am glad I got it from the library, as I would probably not want to buy this book myself.

0671027344|3.0|This review contains spoilers<br /><br />OK, seriously, how I could pass up a book with a title like The Perks of Being a Wallflower? Especially after I read the back and it painted a picture of a shy, gawky and confused highschool kid who had to deal with similar issues that I did during that time?<br /><br />Well, at least that's what I thought I'd be reading. It started out good enough. The writing is amusing, and some of the teenage \\"insights\\" were downright hilarious. There were also a few bits here and there that were amazingly well done and surprisingly painful.<br /><br />However, taken as a whole, it's a bit too busy and I lost the believability near the end. I don't doubt that a great many intelligent kids have social difficulties in high school (I know that my own experiences were... suboptimal)...<br /><br />However, the concept that, in the course of one year, a kid can learn about sex and masturbation, get addicted to tobacco, experiment with marijuana and LSD, overcome his own self-esteem problems, deal with child molestation, witness a rape, witness physical abuse, deal with an abortion, have his first drink, etc etc etc... well, it seems contrived. (As is the concept of a kid that gets to be freshman, knows about sex, but has never masturbated before.)<br /><br />Let me just say that a person can be interesting and have emotional issues resulting from intelligence and poor social skills without having to have been physically or sexually abused. It gets tiresome to read books where such a situation either launches the character on their journey, or (in the case of this book) it becomes a surprise twist at the end.<br /><br />This book would have been so much better had the kid just been a really bright kid who \\"didn't get it\\". There's ample drama and angst in a normal well-adjusted teenager that it's unnecessary to create especially painful experiences for the reader. In many ways, this seems to be the easy way out.<br /><br />The format is one that is easy to do wrong (collection of letters), but works in this case because the writing style is believable for the type of character writing it... and it's all written by one person, so you don't have the problem of tracking dialogue that often results such such a format.<br /><br />All in all, the writing is good, and there are some very well written and evocative bits. However, I don't recommend that anyone make it a point to read this one. More importantly, I don't recommend that any angsty teenagers read it at all... it's not likely to help (and could well hinder).n this case because the writing style is believable for the type of character writing it... and it's all written by one person, so you don't have the problem of tracking dialogue that often results such such a format.

3822817015|4.0|Like most Taschen art books, this is a high quality publication, nicely printed and bound. There is a good deal of information and many paintings  for the top artists (Elvgren, Petty, etc) and short bios and paintings for dozens more. The paintings are why you'd buy it of course, and the reproductions are excellent. Often the editors did not have originals to work from but that seldom shows. A very few of the larger prints of what must be reproductions are a bit blurry, but not many. However, I personally would have preferred fewer examples so that more of the paintings could be full page. Lots are, but in more cases the reproductions are quarter page and sometimes nine to a page. They are still very good due to the quality reproduction, but lose much of their impact. And impact, after all, is what pin-up art was all about. Still, there's something to be said for quantity too, and this 447-page book has hundreds of fine paintings. Two other quibbles. This hardback has a printed cover, rather than a paper cover, which to me makes it less classy as a display book. I know, I know, it's a pin-up book, but still. Also, like many art books, all the descriptions (the words) are in English, German and French. No complaint, but it's worth knowing in advance that many pages are dedicated to this duplication. That said, if the subject interests you, this is a must have, just like another of the authors' pin-up books for Taschen, [[ASIN:3836503050 Gil Elvgren: All His Glamorous American Pin-Ups (Taschen 25th Anniversary Special Editions)]].
0439882826|5.0|Seriously, everyone who has seen this book LOVES it - young or old, it makes no difference.  You don't have to be a Star Wars fan either to appreciate it.
0786852550|4.0|I am a 40 yr old man with what seems like a propensity for teenage based books.  In spite of that I am somewhat critical of the writing, narrative, plot movement, etc.  I really enjoyed the Amulet of Samarkand.  I look forward to buying the other two in the series.
B0010358CG|5.0|Animation and story line was excellent. We need to see more animation like this come out. Looked fantastic on my PS3. Blu-ray is the way to go.
B0013K6WLM|5.0|It's no wonder movie makers, commercial ad companies, concert, radio and all other mix media venues seek this band out. They are really creative. GIVE ME MORE BLACK KEYS! Fearless and extremely talented . What a great mix. These guys are going to be around for many years to come and I look forward to their next project.  Every time I listen to the songs on this CD, I \\"hear\\" something new. Don't listen to the CD expecting anything in particular....just sit back and let them take you for a ride. You won't be disappointed.   Good Job you guys.
0792843584|1.0|A recent article in the Guardian (excellent UK newspaper) featured this film prominently when assessing criteria for \\"The Worst Film Of All Time\\".      The journalist's name is Joe Queenan.  I suggest you do a web search on the article - it's absolutely hilarious.      Showgirls has some competition!
B000UX6THK|5.0|I didn't realize how much I'd missed \\"Twin Peaks\\" until I saw it again... and once I started I couldn't stop watching (for long). It's still better than most of the fluff on the tube these days, and I'm sure that I'll watch it (from beginning to end) again. The boxed set has some excellent bonus features, and the video quality is also excellent. The only thing missing is a director's commentary, though otherwise this is a comprehensive boxed set that's well worth the purchase price.
B000654YK6|5.0|This was by far one of the greatest Grunge documentary I have ever seen. If you are a fan of a ton of Seattle bands, or want to learn more this is the product for you! I loved it, recommend it to anyone. Enjoy.
0525950079|5.0|I loved the first book \\"The Pillars of the Earth\\" and decided to purchase the sequel, though did not realize that the time period for this book is about 400 years later.  There are only several references to the characters in the first book.  Even so, the second book was just as entertaining and interesting.  Ken Follett is an excellent writer no matter what time period he chooses to place his stories/characters.  I'd recommend both books if you are interested in life in the 12th/16th century England and if you love history.
0767817710|5.0|I bought this for my Father who is into all the old western, war time movies.  He looked all over the place for this movie and could not find it, so I looked on Amazon and tah-dah!  I ordered it and recieved it within three days, my Father didn't know I had found it.  He was so happy, he's watched it at least four times, and now his DVD collection is at around 250 movies.  If I need to find something, I know where to go from now on.  It's quick and easy.
1567184855|5.0|This is the first of three books that Michael Newton Ph.D. has written on this subject of our souls and the spirit world in which we all reside. It is one of the most accurate writings on this subject. This book, Journey of Souls, and the companion to it; \\"Destiny of Souls\\" is an eye opening collection of client dialog and author analogy that will satify your  metaphysical thirst for the true relationship between the soul and the host body it will choose to occupy. It explains how our immortal soul can repeatedly integrate with a mortal brain and its body to reach goals of improvement by living lives on this planet Earth. If you're searching for answers on what life is all about,this is a good read.
0446677450|4.0|This is a great book for information, especially for the beginner in wealth growth. The book gives excellent depiction on what is needed to start growing your wealth portfolio and how the rich get ahead and why the poor (in this case, middle class) end up without true economic growth. The only area where the book could improve is in actually giving the steps to achieve wealth and not just the info.
B000000OXH|4.0|As a follow-up release to ASIA's self-titled best-selling album, \\"Alpha\\" does a relatively good job of holding its own.    The biggest hit featured, \\"Don't Cry\\", doesn't have nearly the punch of the first album's claim to fame, \\"Heat Of The Moment\\", but it is still an enjoyable listen.    One of the drawbacks of the album is that so many of its selections, while truly well-executed, never received their much-deserved attention and airplay on the radio at the time of the album's release.  \\"Never In A Million Years\\" is a fine power ballad, and \\"My Own Time (I'll Do What I Want)\\" is a powerful anthem for any wannabe rebellious teen of the '80s. The song that comes closest to the strength and impact of the first album is \\"The Heat Goes On\\", with cords and lyrics that harken back to the band's initial work.    But it must be noted that there is one near-criminal omission on this CD. In the original LP and cassette release of 1983, there was a final song included, entitled \\"Daylight\\". Arguably the best song on the entire album, it was presumably cut because back in the day CDs were quite new and the time allotted on them was fairly limited. Rather than examine the listing for the least impressive piece, the final track was simply eliminated when \\"Alpha\\" first came out on CD.  (Why, in a time where we can now fit 20 tracks on one dsic, the album was never re-released with its original, full listing, is beyond me.)    If you can find the song \\"Daylight\\" on another collection or download it, do so by all means. \\"Alpha\\" is indeed worth having in your music library, but preferably on vinyl or, if you can actually find one, cassette. It's CD version is indeed lacking considerably with one of its best cuts missing.
B000H1RFKU|5.0|Really good story and some of it may be true.   Mostly in Chicago!    I don't like the fact the Denzel was \\"made\\" to use the \\"N\\" word all though the movie.    We just had a woman in town that got fined $75.00 for calling children hanging from a tree, monkeys!   Yep, they were black children and the mother got angry.   However these \\"movie stars\\" use those and worse for the sake of a few dollars.

B000HL0EEE|4.0|With the demise of the Star Trek TNG, DS9 and Voyager, I never took the time to watch this series believing it was a desperate attemtpt to keep Star Trek going.  I was positively wrong.  This Star Trek series was outstanding and was in many ways far superior to its predecessors.  Perhaps because it brought us closer to home and was more straight-forward and down-to-earth about how people think, feel, act and react.  The THIRD SEASON was stupendous while SEASON FOUR was just as good and satisfied some long-unanswered questions to things from the previous incarnations (no, season 4 is not available here; I went out and purchased it on DVD--your loss Amazon).  However, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND this series.  The reason I gave it only 4 STARS is because I felt that it was unnecessary to inject sexually suggestive scenes to make the series work.  It was at times, over the top to say the least.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|If you are a person of deep moral cowardice, what you need to do to protect yourself during this film is to ignore the huge truths being talked about and focus on the films flaws.  If you do that, you will be able to sleep at night and rationalize away what you are doing to your fellow citizen, which you so desperately need to do.<br /><br />(Okay, okay, you're a good guy or gal and the above would never, ever apply to you.  Excuse me, you know, I get all worked up over nothing.  In fact, if you want, just to make amends, I'll help you make up criticisms of this film in order to justify your owning four cars while letting people die in the getter, because we all know that creating an economic inconvenience to you is really the worst thing that could ever happen for humankind, right?)<br /><br />Anyway, force yourself to watch this film, all of it.  (No fair chickening out by fast-forwarding to the flawed parts and only focusing on those.  That's cheating.  This feels like trying to force-feed a pill to a dog that doesn't get what medicine is.  People just can't stare it in the face without chickening out and ducking out on the true implications of this film.)<br /><br />Moore is simply sick of this:  We are watching each other die in the gutter as we cling to our SUVs.  The whole point of the film is to show that an additional one percent tax on our GDP to get medical care to everyone won't bankrupt you.  By the way, I went to London last year, for the only time in my life, and, in case you didn't know it, millionaires and billionaires get along very, very well, even with a big welfare state. Surprise!  You can still be very rich and still let your fellow citizens go to the doctor.  In fact, the average household I saw in London was just way wealthier in terms of all the education, health care and housing than most of us.  The whole four days I was there, I didn't see a single person living in the street, and I was not panhandled once.  (See Union Square in San Francisco for a study in contrast.)<br /><br />So give in and see the film and just pray to your God for strength, or whatever it takes, to just get over your selfishness long enough to see what we're permitting to happen.<br /><br />Oh, how do I know all this?  I ended up on permanent disability.  How?  No access to health care.  So now, instead of paying for a few doctors appointments now and then, the government has to pay all of my bills all year.  Wow, good going.  That was some deep money saving there.  Here's my prediction, if you take Moore's advice, what you'll find is that you save money.<br /><br />For instance, a person who gets no health care until they have need of an emergency room, racks up ten times the bills as the average person who is insured.  In my case, society thought it could be slick by denying me routine access to good doctors.  Society thought it could be slick by not allowing me any sick days.  It's the old corporate CEO mentality of just getting through this quarterly statement and making the books look good and getting a bonus, leaving the real bills for later folks to pay, and leaving the real disaster to the next CEO, and getting out in time to get another bonus before dumping the whole mess on everyone else.<br /><br />Trust me, the government could have saved countless dollars by letting me have health care and sick days off.  In fact, we already have a weird universal health care system that runs this way:  Don't serve the poor till they go to the emergency room.  Let the poor person run up a half-million dollar bill they can never pay.  Turn around, (the hospitals do this), and then hit the state up for the money anyway.  So we just go ahead and sneak that money in the back door through the state and county hospital reimbursement plans anyhow.  So why not just pay for the guy to see a doctor a few times and get basic care for a few hundred bucks, rather than end up paying a half-million dollars to treat someone who can now probably never recover.<br /><br />Okay, all you greedy Orange County people, time to face up to it.  Sit down and watch the monster your free-market doctrines have created.<br /><br />Mel C. Thompson.le, time to face up to it.  Sit down and watch the monster your free-market doctrines have created.    Mel C. Thompson.
0385338724|5.0|I just want to say that I am a 23 year old female college student who HATES to read... It is very hard for me to find a good book, and I am very very picky!  This book had me glued! Sophie Kinsella is brilliant with her writing of this book, her development of the characters and everything.  It was a flawless presentation.  I found myself cracking up with laughter, or almost tearing up when reading this book, it was like I was there in the story, like I knew the characters.  Honestly, since I grew out of the 100 page kids books of which I liked like only like 3 or 4 of, I have only found 3 books that I truly loved, and Remember Me? is now number 4.  I can't wait to begin reading Sophie Kinsella's other novels.  This is the first of hers that I have read and I am hooked.  Perhaps I should wait until finals are completed to start another of her books though, because with this book open, I didn't get a thing done!!!  I highly recommend this book to anyone who is around college age, or young at heart.  I wouldn't be surprised if this book makes best seller!!! It should!!
B000U7169M|4.0|This movie actually suprised me.  I wasn't expecting much, but it actually turned out to be really good, with a great story line.  I orginally bought this just because I know one of the actors who has a minor part in the movie, but I am glad I bought it.  It has a sort of suprise ending and it will keep you interested the whole time.
0312117337|5.0|One of the most beautiful packs of Tarot Cards I have ever came across. You can relate each and every one of them to some part of your life. They are inspirational and have a lesson in each of them. I get all of my friends to buy them. I recommend them to everyone who needs direction in their lives.
1596680296|5.0|Wow! After purchasing about five other sock-knitting how-to books, HERE'S the one I should have bought at the very first!     Not only does Ms. Budd cover the rudiments of sock making and shaping, etc, she covers about every GAUGE imaginable. Do you want to make socks out of a bulky Boucle yarn? No problem! She has the gauge for that. Wanna try out socks with a basic worsted weight? She's got that here too! PLUS, she has all sorts of beautiful stitches to jazz up your socks. She even has the stitches divided up according to their repeats, so you can easily find a stitch pattern that will work with the amount of stitches you need for your gauge.    I haven't gotten through all the book yet. But what I've seen so far is...WOW! I've got another book on order from Ms. Budd. Can't wait!    In short: BUY THIS ONE. Yeah!
B0000X61UU|5.0|this is the best workout ever.  I first tried it when I went to visit my sister in Britain, I liked it because it did not have a lot of fancy moves. I wanted another workout that I could do when it got too hot to run in the Mohave Desert, where I lived for 2 years.  I bought the VHS tape when I got home.<br />I have tried other workouts since, but have never been happy with the workout or the results.  I like the fact that I am 50 years old, and still have a six pack toned arms, shoulders and thighs. I do this workout at least 5 times a week before work.  I don't always do the whole workout but I always do at least 30-to 40 min and always try to do the arm section of the workout when I get home.<br />This workout is good for any age and I hope I am still doing The Next Challenge when I am 80!
B000WZAE1I|5.0|Wonderful movie - funny at times (DeNiro's character is a hoot), romantic, and clever.  A nice twist to all those fairytales that we grew up with.  If you like the fantasy genre, this film is definitely a must-see!
B000068QVN|5.0|I've read most of the reviews and have to disagree with the complaints concerning sound quality. Considering this is vintage 1971 GFR, this is a amazing sounding disc and the performances captured here are some of the best I've heard. I recommend this disc even for the casual fans and this was meant to be played loud. For those complaining about the sound, it you have a EQ use it and I think you will be more than satisfied. I read that the entire historic Shea performance is something that is being considered for a future release. I will be one of the first in line to purcahse when and if this happens.
0739366416|5.0|Very good book.  I truly enjoyed it and it helped me to think about America's future.
B000BJS4SU|5.0|this is not your pop radio version of john mayer.  here he teams up with steve jordan on drums and pino palladino on bass to create a rockin' sound.  it is quite evident that john listened to a lot of srv growing up and some of his solos on this disc show that.  get it.
B000002JS6|2.0|I grew up occasionally listening to AC/DC, always in the background from friends playing it at school or in a car.  It never stood out to me. Now at 41 I rediscovered this old band and like it a lot.  I especially like listening to it while weight lifting.  \\"Back in Black\\" and \\"Dirty Deeds\\" are both raw and raunchy (like the classic Mississippi Delta Blues these guys probably grew up listening to), but after listening to both several times I find that song for song, \\"Dirty Deeds\\" is better than \\"Back in Black\\".  Both have AC/DC's signature sound and are milestones of the hard rock genre, but I just don't get tired of listening to \\"Dirty Deeds\\" which I can't say about \\"Back in Black\\".  In rediscovering this band, I was a little surprised to later find out that next to Michael Jackson's \\"Thriller\\", \\"Back in Black\\" is the #2 selling album of all time.  Okay, but I personally don't hear it in the album.  But this is just the perspective of a straight white male with no tattoos whose favorite album of all time is Dire Strait's \\"Brothers in Arms\\"....
B0013D8LOU|1.0|I love Johnny Depp, and Alan Rickman is another of my favorite actors, but even they couldn't make this movie appealing for me.  Just too much blood spurting and draining from too many necks.  I did enjoy hearing Johnny Depp sing, but the rest of the movie just seemed somehow slow and dull, punctuated by the horrible bloody sequences.<br /><br />To be fair, Tim Burton's movies aren't usually my cup of tea, and I definitely don't like blood and gore.  In this case, though, I thought the premise sounded very interesting, and I was hopeful that Johnny Depp playing a major role would make up for the blood I'd heard so much about.  Sadly for me, no.  Even my friend, who doesn't mind a bit of blood, found it trying.<br /><br />If you like dark movies and don't mind lots of blood spurting and draining from many people's necks, this movie is worth a try.  If you really don't like bloody movies, I'd recommend steering clear of Sweeney Todd, even if you're a Johnny Depp fan - or at least rent it and don't shell out the purchase price until you know you'd want to watch it again.<br /><br />If you like Johnny Depp and enjoy suspense mixed with a dark edge, watch \\"Secret Window\\" - it certainly has its violent side, but much more is left to the imagination, which I prefer.  I can know something terrible happened without having to witness every gory moment of the deed.

B0002X1JKU|5.0|An all time classic from Mr. Benjamin Graham, and still relevant to this day. If you think it is an outdated stuff, I humbly request you to think again. I have read quite a lot of books on investment and none I found come closer to this one, whether you consider the philosophy or the practical implementation.     You may not believe me, and I am not asking you to do so. I am only requesting you to read this book once before you start investing, then go ahead in the world of investing.    When you think you have made somekind of mistake in investing, go back and read the book again, and I can say 99% of time you will find something in this book which if you have followed, would have avoided the mistake. It's a personal experience.

B00000IPAX|4.0|I don't have MTV or listen to commercial radio or really pay much attention to mainstream media, so I had no prejudice love or dislike toward Blink182 when I bought their famous Enema Of The State release. The reason I first got this was because I heard and saw drummer Travis Barker play and was very impressed - so much that I wanted to hear his band. This is the only Blink182 album I have at this point, and I like it a lot, but not so much that I'm going to get their entire discography. It's excellent power-pop-punk along the lines of Green Day, with a heavy Ramones influence. Travis, as I expected, is awesome and the drumming stands out for me on this CD. The lyrics are a bit goofy on purpose, and the music is... well a lot like Green Day - fast power chords in a driving rhythm. Very accessable music on the fast/heavy side that would appeal to a fairly wide audience. There's not a bad song on here, but my favorites include Dumpweed, Don't Leave Me, What's My Age Again, Adam's Song.
B00005B1W5|5.0|I love all of Yanni's musical DVDs.  It more fun to watch the joy in his musicians faces as they play than just listening on a CD.  Great music, great fun, get all of Yanni on DVD.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|If you are a Stargate SG1 Fan (which I am). This movie is really really great! It was great to have the gang back together again. If you can't tell I LOVED IT. I hope the next one Continnum is just as good. I hope that these movies will stay on the Best Seller list for at least 52 weeks and they make MGM $50,000,000.00 each, so they can line up about 16 more movies and or find a way to keep the movies coming, and some way to return to TV.
B000BT97AO|4.0|As numerous viewrs have said, the film is visually stunning.  But.  I didn't feel much emotional connection with the characters, withthe exception of Stephanie Leonides who plays Helena and does a pretty good job setting up her character prior to falling into the fantasy sequence that is the heart of the film.      But the other characters just didn't touch me, and it took forever to understand what was supposed to be going on in the the fantasy seaquence.  The commentayr on the DVD is instructive - originally there was a five minute opening seaquence tht set up the entire premise for the fantasy portion of the film, but that was cut after feedback from virtually everyone who previewed the film because no one could relate emotionally to the main characters.  So instead the film is introduce with what another reviewer has characterized (not inaccurately) as a TV soap opera seqauence.    I also have a major grip with the musical score.  To my ears the music did little to enhance the film or create an emotional connection with its narrative or characters. From the commentary I gather that the composrer and musicians are major talents but as a film score it fell realy flat and in fact I often fund the musical score to be an intrusive annoyance.     So now to my point - despite these criticisms I beliefve that this is a film that deserves repeated viewing, once with sound on just to figure out what is going on and then as a \\"silent film\\" with the subtitles on and the sound muted.  You may miss an occasional bit of humor but you will be rewarded with a unique visual experience.  Som eo fthe characters, VAlentine in particular, may come off bbetter in the \\"silent\\" version.    Because this film lacks the emotion connection of for examle Wizard of Oz and Pans Labyrint (two films with comparable fantasy elements), 4 stars might eem a little high.  But it has such elements of greatness that I think it deserves that rating.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|This was an excellent conclusion to the Ori storyline, however it felt like they were just tacking on old plot devices to lengthen the story in some parts.  However, this was defiantly worth the money and I am eagerly awaiting Continuum.
1594489505|5.0|\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is a novel of superlative quality.  Mr. Hosseini does an awe-inspiring job breathing life into the three main characters and ensuring that you feel empathy, sorrow and admiration for two of those characters and abhorrence for the third.  I was thoroughly impressed with Mr. Hosseini's ability to write so poignantly from the perspective of two women, when he has never lived as a woman himself.<br /><br />This novel is a great story about the human spirit, friendship and love and although it is often a \\"heavy\\" read, ultimately, it offers a  message of hope and survival.  Set in Afghanistan in the mid-1990s, the story is told from the points of view of Mariam and Laila.  Mariam is a \\"harami,\\" the illegitimate offspring of a wealthy local businessman who lives with her mother on the outskirts of Kabul.  Although she is able to see her father once a week, she is never allowed to live among her legitimate siblings.  When Mariam's life drastically and suddenly changes, she seeks shelter with her father's legitimate family only to be rejected and cast aside.  Mariam's father finds Rasheed, a local shoemaker, to marry her off to...however, it soon becomes readily apparent that Rasheed is a deplorable man prone to jealousy and violence.<br /><br />Laila, a child of remarkable beauty, lives down the street from Rasheed and Mariam.  As Laila matures, her family situation falls apart and out of necessity, she joins Rasheed's household as his second wife.  Initially, there is considerable tension between Mariam and Laila but as their story progresses, the two women find solace and comfort in one another.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" is easily one of the best novels I've ever read and I highly recommend it to anyone looking for a truly touching, unforgettable and incredibly well-written story.
B0012K1ILW|3.0|I love Erykah Badu but I have to say i was a little disappointed. Now don't get me wrong there are few bangers on here like: \\"Honey(which is a hidden track)\\", \\"My People\\", \\"Soldier\\" but I tend to get lost in the flow. It takes so many directions. This album seems like it isn't complete, like something is missing but it's still worth purchasing.
1400032717|4.0|True, this novel was different from anything else I've ever read. Possibly that is the reason for its popularity. I'd think that most people would want to know more about autism, what with it on the rise, though I did have to admit that I wasn't totally sympathetic for Christopher. My dog, however, did get my sympathy.     The form of the book is unique and the story short. Not the best book I've read, but certainly something you should try.

B000SM7QUC|5.0|The fact that this goes along with the book, is amazing. I've read the book and played the CD along with it, and it really does add to the experience. The music stands up strong by itself, and Nikki Sixx could have a really strong run releasing CD's by Sixx Am in the future.   I tried this whole book/CD approach with the Chris Jericho book \\"Around The World in Spandex\\" with the new Fozzy CD/DVD All That Remains Reloaded, and oddly enough it was very cool...though I like the Fozzy CD just slightly more than the Sixx AM...but their both great releases.
B00005JPS6|4.0|My daughter saw Bee Movie in the theater and had to have it on DVD.  She's only 3.5 but can watch this over and over. And she loves the songs Sugar Sugar and Here Comes the Sun.  Everytime they play in the movie she gets up and dances.  I think this movie would bee good for kids of all ages.  It was better than most animated movies.
0099511495|5.0|Louisa May Alcott wrote many books, from her \\"blood and thunder\\" tales to heartwarming novels about teens growing up.<br /><br />But there's something special about \\"Little Women,\\" a fictionalized account of her own family's growing pins. Thewarmly realistic stories, sense of comedy and tragedy, and insights into human nature make the romance, humor and fun little anecdotes of \\"Little Women\\" come alive.<br /><br />The four March girls -- practical Meg, rambunctious Jo, sweet Beth and childish artist Amy -- live in genteel New England poverty with their Marmee, while their father is away in the Civil War. The girls don't let lack of money hamper their fun and happiness. But their world starts to expand when Jo befriends \\"poor little rich boy\\" Laurie, and soon he and his tutor are almost a part of their family.<br /><br />Along with him, the girls encounter many of the bumps of growing up -- the destruction of Jo's treasured writing, romps with wealthier pals, Amy's expulsion from school, and Meg's reluctant first romance. But their lives are turned upside-down when Beth contracts scarlet fever, and they receive news that their father has been seriously injured -- and these crises threaten to destroy the heart of their family.<br /><br />The second half of the book opens with Meg's wedding -- if not to her dream guy, then to her love. But while time has mellowed and matured the Little Women, it hasn't lessened the capacity for conflict and unintentional comedy -- particularly with the now-attractive Amy, whose attempts to pursue art, culture and the appearance of wealthy sophistication usually go horribly wrong.<br /><br />But the platonic friendship between Laurie and Jo is shattered when he admits his true feelings to her... and gets rejected. Distraught, he goes to Europe, as does Amy with crusty old Aunt March. And left in New England, Jo is faced with the question of what her life has in store, despite Beth's picturesquely poor health. Her new job as a governess leads her to put her treasured stories into print... leading her to love and her future.<br /><br />There's a clearly autobiographical tone to \\"Little Women\\" -- and since the March girls really are like the girls next door, this doesn't exactly come as a shock. How much of it is real? A passage late in the book portrays a post-\\"blood and thunder\\" Alcott -- in the form of Jo -- \\"scribbling\\" down the book itself, and getting it published because it feels so real and true.<br /><br />And it does. Alcott's writing is a warm, smooth string of interconnected stories, some of them quiet and some peppered with silly jokes, moments of tragedy, poetry, and unintentional humiliation (\\"Salt instead of sugar. And the cream is sour\\"). Sometimes, especially in the beginning, Alcott is a bit too preachy and hamhanded. But her touch becomes defter as she writes on.<br /><br />The best part of this book is the March girls themselves -- they have flaws and strengths, ambitions and dreams that never quite turn out as they expect. And their misadventures -- like Amy's embarrassing problem with her huge lobster, or Meg's makeover at a rich friend's house -- have the feeling of authenticity.<br /><br />Lovable Jo is the quintessential tomboy -- rough, gawky, fun-loving, impulsive, with a love of literature and a mouth that is slightly too big. Meg's love of luxury adds a flaw to the \\"perfect little homemaker\\" image, and while  Amy is an annoying little brat throughout much of the first half of the book, by her teens she's almost as likable as Jo.<br /><br />It must be admitted that Beth is not quite as endearing -- she's canonized with the 19th-century approach to the deceased, and so is continuously sweet, loving and understanding. But Laurie makes up for this: a wealthy, artistic, passionate young man who goes through all the growing pains, as he tries to be worthy of the girl he adores. Don't worry, things turn out all right for him.<br /><br />\\"Little Women\\" is one of those rare classic novels that is still relevant, funny, fresh and heartbreaking today. The March family will come alive, and never quite leave.ly will come alive, and never quite leave.

0321544080|2.0|I got the book thinking of learning some from this great photographer.  One just can wonder how he got the pictures. The book is great as a coffee table but not good as a learning tool.  His session on equipment doesn't cover much. He just listed his great cameras, filters and more. No explanations or suggestions are offered. The pictures are great but no much cover on how they were taken.  BUT if you want to indulge your eye and have your guess have a topic a conversation you may want to buy it.

Some of what he says is hard to understand at first, which is why the web classes that Oprah has help so much to give you a fuller understanding of what the book means. I truly believe if people pay attention to what the book is saying and apply it to their life, their life will be changed forever, for the better. I already see a change in myself. I would encourage and recommend the book to anyone that reads it with an open mind.
B000094HMU|1.0|Domingo, Marton, Mitchell,  Plishka, and Ping- Pang- and Pong are wonderful. Zeffirelli created a masterful set and beautiful costumes. The orchestra, chorus, and James Levine are top-class as usual.    So why the one star and the title: Tutto Dorma/ Jay David Saks SUCKS?  Opera is an all encompassing audio-visual art form. Sound balance is critical. As the audio producer, Saks must have been asleep while recording the audio portion of this DVD. How else can you explain the awful sound imbalance? All singers are constantly overpowered by the orchestra: the principals sound as though they are singing in a cave a mile deep inside while the recording microphone is placed in the midst of  a pile of  bat guano at the entrance just adjacent to the orchestra. Time to wake up and tinker with your audio-control panel Mr. Saks...and shame to DG for allowing the release of this DVD before such correction.    Additionally, Kirk Browning the video director must have been short of funds when hiring his camera crew. From the looks of things, he must have hired a crew of 3 year olds who had never handled a camera prior to this occasion: the focus either constantly shifts from close-ups to pan-outs at random intervals without attention to the action or to side shots of no particular interest or connection to the action on stage.  And, of course, he too must have been a 'dorma' while directing the visuals-- otherwise, in good conscience how would he have allowed such \\"visuals\\".    Two other less significant quibbles:  The first-  also, in part, relates to the camera operators: a lot of the action is partly obstructed by the throng of supernumeraries sitting at the apron of the stage during a significant portion of the opera; was this really necessary Mr. Zefirelli--- and if so, why couldn't the camera shoot over their heads allowing an otherwise unobstructed view of the stage?  The second- the stage was very dark ( i.e. lack of lighting) during much of the first Act and a significantportion of the second Act.    Again: opera is an audio-visual art. With crappy sound and poor visuals the enjoyment factor is markedly lessened for the viewing audience. Shame on DG for releasing this otherwise excellent Turandot.
B000G03RJA|5.0|I've been a Laura Brannigan fan for many years.  I have all of her old records, but I seldom play them as it's a pain to get out the old record player.  Buying this CD allowed me to relive the great songs that she did while riding in my car, and it's been great hearing her again after so long.  Highly recommended!
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Goldfrapp was brought to my attention by a young woman with multiple piercings and tattoo art (I'm 57).  It was hidden under the tag \\"Electronica\\".  Ha!  There's more of Enya here than Moby (and he's good, too).  Alison Goldfrapp has the most beautiful voice and the instrumentals are gorgeous.  Try \\"A&E\\" and/or \\"Little Bird\\".  My teenager has taken my copy back to school with him but I've luckily put it on my iPod, too.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|The Art of Truth was an interesting and fast paced ending to the SG-1 Ori storyline, tying up some loose ends along the way.  I thought the movie could have benefitted from being a little longer (2 hours or so instead of about an hour and a half), especially since we were left with such an open ending of the regular series.  There could have been some more historical scenes and some better explanations of things that needed to be wrapped up from the series.  However, overall I feel that the movie is a pretty good wrap up of the story.  It definitely had some great music (adding a symphony orchestra rather than synthesized music is almost always better in my book) and awesome visual effects (a bigger movie budget always helps not that the series had bad effects by any means).  Hopefully, future movies will wrap up a few more things as well as introducing some new ideas.
B0013D8LOU|5.0|If you were to tell me that \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" would end up being one of my top favorite movies of 2007, I would've told you that you were completely mad.  For one thing, I'm not a giant fan of musicals.  I can take them in small doses, but for the most part I stay away from them.  They always seemed fake and forced to me.  Still, I wanted to see the movie.  I like Tim Burton, and I like Johnny Depp.  The movie seemed twisted and dark enough, so why not?  I popped the DVD in and it didn't take long for me to completely buy into everything this bloody musical has to offer.  Indeed, it is one of the best movies to come out of 2007, or at least I think so.<br /><br />Benjamin Barker was a famous barber with a lovely wife and daughter, but a cruel and sadistic judge was also in love with his wife, so he had Benjamin sent away for life for a crime he did not commit.  Many years later, Benjamin returns to London completely dead inside.  The color from his skin is gone and everything that once was life inside of him has deteriorated.  When he learns that after the ordeal of his sudden \\"deportation\\" his wife had poisoned herself and his daughter was held captive by the judge, Benjamin... no...  Todd.  Sweeney Todd vows vengeance and payment in blood.  Not only that, but he sees all of humanity as being completely worthless in the end, and that everybody deserves to die.<br /><br />I'm trying to be as brief as possible when describing the story, as you'll learn secrets and twists along the way.  The film is done completely in song with very few moments of actual pure dialogue.  I will admit that it took me a little bit to get used to all of the singing, but it didn't take long.  The music isn't bad at all and the songs will get stuck in your head.  I'm impressed by how well this cast can sing.  Especially Depp, who proves to not only be terrifying in his presence, but also proves to have one helluva singing voice.  The music is what pushes the movie and tells the story, and I have to say that it works splendidly.<br /><br />Now, you must realize this when it comes to \\"Sweeney Todd:\\"  It is an acquired taste.  You will either love it or hate it.  I don't see much of a middle ground with this one.  If demented and morbid subject matter such as throat-slashing and cannibalism puts you off, then you'll want to find another movie.  I would not, however, be put off with the idea of seeing the movie if you hate musicals, because like I said I'm not a big fan of them.  The movie is twisted and bizarre enough that it'll keep your attention throughout.  Tim Burton is once again successful at painting a bleak and gloomy environment filled with death and dread, and yet present it in such an ironically beautiful way.  The two-disc version includes some neat behind-the-scenes featurettes that are worth checking out.<br /><br />I have to say it, \\"Sweeney Todd: The Demon Barber of Fleet Street\\" is a morbidly fantastic time that puts a whole new spin on musicals.  It has the ability to charm those who are not necessarily into musicals.  It is a dark and depressing story, but it is so well done that most of us can't help but stay along for the ride.  Not only is it one of my top favorite movies of 2007, but it is also a new favorite in general.  I will be a little hesitant when I go to my barber, however... or, at least I will be sure to skip the shave.  -Michael Cranehe story, and I have to say that it works splendidly.

B0002GTWQA|4.0|It was nice to watch this film again, an old friend from my teen years.  Fans of the novel know the story so I won't repeat it here.  The film is true to the book for the most part, with an altered ending that brings comprehendable closure.  Brooks' screenplay allows Jim redemption and purification through death, suitably in the Malay ritual of his adopted people, a nice touch.  I also took as a compliment to the story the stereotyped portrayal of the Malays, as a sort-of wallpaper for the European characters.  This captures the essence of Conrad and it was refreshing to see this in this 1965 pre-PC film.  I hate to think how a modern director would present this story; no doubt it would be transformed into \\"Apocalypto\\" or \\"Dances With Wolves\\", white-man-bad-brown-man-good.  Very un-Conrad.  I was struck by the similarities in music, set and overall feel to the Kurtz native army scenes from \\"Apocalypse Now\\", another Conrad-based story that obviously inspired Coppolla.  Overall, a 4-star film with beautiful photography, a good pace and well-developed characters.  A minor minus for me are O'Toole's effeminate mannerisms which I could accept in \\"Lawrence\\", true to the alleged sexual orientation of that character.  Here, they're simply annoying.
0385338724|5.0|It's a tried and true made for TV movie theme.    Someone, usually someone down on their luck like the ugly girl in high school or the miserable kid, makes a wish that they were all grown up. And then presto-they are! It's X amount of years in the future and suddenly they are an adult and have become beautiful, popular and have a wonderful life.     But that doesn't mean they're prepared to deal with it.     Sophie Kinsella has taken this common and (frankly) overused plot line and remade it into a wonderful, hilarious, romantic and hugely touching novel that is really her best work yet.    Lexi Smart has an entry level job and no yearly bonus, a boyfriend who everyone calls loser Dave, snaggly teeth and her father's funeral to attend in the morning. She doesn't make a wish for a better life, but she does fall on her head. And wakes up in the hospital with a great body, perfect teeth, a fantastic job, the perfect husband and no memory of the last three years.     It seems perfect at first. Her life is great on the surface. She's rich, good looking and married to a millionaire Greek god. But as she gets to know her new life she realizes that she is missing from it. The new Lexi is dramatically different from the old and not only in appearance. Nowhere is there any trace of the girl she once was-and, thanks to a bump on the head, is again.     Until she learns that this self has secrets-huge secrets which may be her only hope of getting the world to remember the girl Lexi Smart used to be.    \\"Remember Me?\\" is by far the best novel Sophie Kinsella has written to date. It is just amazing! I laughed out loud, felt Lexi's initial joy and later frustration and anger and swooned at the romance. This book has propelled Kinsella out of the chick lit genera and into the category of just plain old great novels. I recommend this to everyone. My only complaint is that the book can be read in several hours-and I wanted more!    Five stars.
B000059XUO|5.0|Brandon Lee was a shas]dow of his father, Bruce Lees, amazing legacy of giving 100% in all that he said and did.  To him, there was no small part, only small actors and he proved it in being the absolute BEST in every part he ever played.  The Crow was, and always will be, his masterpiece both in life and in death.  As a fan, my fiance and I have gone to puut flowers at his grave several times.  Last time we went we were sitting, on the bench between he and his fathers grave, talking about the movie and how erie it was when the crow came and sat on his charecters grave to call him back to life to settle accounts.  When we had gotten back in the car I turned to say goodbye and bless them both where ever they may both be, and right in front of both our eyes as well as his sisters, a crow floated down with the ease of an angel and came to rest on Brandons grave.  While he and his sister were franticly looking for a camera, the crow turned and I swear it looked directly at me, stared eye to eye with me.  I have yet to feel such a peace of well being in a grave yard again.  Then the bird cawed and with a lift of wings disappeared into the trees.<br />PERFECTION OF THE SOUL!
B001437DMA|3.0|This review comes after only one listen-through, but I wanted to go with my first impressions.  The first two and last two songs are great.  I Just Wanna Rock is just a step above sucking badly.  It's a lame concept, and the song is only saved by a pretty cool solo.  Professor Satcha-Crapolis....uh, let's move on.  Revelation is very good; Come On Baby is the obligatory wimpy love ballad.  Now for Out Of The Sunrise...this song completely sucks in every conceivable way.  It bites so hard, it's like a pitbull on your privates.  That lame, looping drum track; the horrific, antiquated 80's pop synthesizer sound...this might be Satch's worst song ever.  It sounds like it fell off of his Not Of This Earth album, with those other weenie 80's fillers.  He doesn't redeem himself with the next track, which I won't even attempt to spell here.  Suffice it to say that it involves an incredibly irritating introduction and closing, although it does clean up a little in the middle.  Fortunately, Satch does redeem himself with the final two tracks.  Both brilliant and reminiscent of the old master.  Overall, this album is not his best effort by any means.  I should have become suspicious when I heard that idiotic album title.  I was hoping it was a bad April Fool's Day joke, but alas, somebody actually thought this was a good album title.  Yikes. This man needs to get back in the trenches and kick some butt like he is capable of doing.  As I said before, there is some great stuff in here, but the bad stuff far outweighs.  A sad step down from the great Super Colossal album.<br /><br />I purchased the CD/DVD set of this album, so I'll say something short about the DVD.  First of all, the making of the new album-portion is a waste of time.  All it does is focus on the making of I Just Wanna Rock.  It's bad enough to listen to this lame song; to watch and hear the making of this lame song makes one beg for death.  Basically, everything on the DVD is throw-away (yes, even the live performance of Surfing, which sounds like it's being recorded out of a well) except for the live studio performances of Ice 9 and Crushing Day.  Crushing Day is, by far, my favorite Satriani song, and it was exhilirating to hear it played live, finally.  Let's just hope he puts this song out on the tour.<br /><br />In closing, thanks for reading my sarcastic review.  I am a huge Satriani fan overall, and wish for future brilliance from the master.of Surfing, which sounds like it's being recorded out of a well) except for the live studio performances of Ice 9 and Crushing Day.

B00000294R|5.0|Big L was so ahead of his time, he had the best rhymes ever i think, (BEtter than Nas, BIG and pac). Big L had a dope group in COC and could have taken over the world. here you find \\"Put it on\\" \\"MVP\\" \\"No Endz No Skinz\\" \\"Danger Zone\\" Street Struck\\" \\"Graveyard\\". all these songs are classic. get this, illmatic, ready to die, the chronic and me against the world and you have the 5 albums that started all this. rap is nonsense nowadays, so take a stroll down memory lane and buy this masterpiece.
B0000640VM|5.0|Excellent service. I recieved the item quickly. I watched the movie as soon as I got it.
B000099T3P|5.0|B-movies seem to have a special place in my heart. This was no excpetion. Another one of those 80's campy sci-fi movies that makes you wonder why you like this movie and how come you haven't changed the channel, lol.<br /><br />Basically, this is about interstellar furballs known as the Crites. They are pure eating machines. They also have porcupine like spines on their backs that they can shoot out and paralyze anything or anyone. Bounty Hunters from another world chase the Crites throughout the galaxy and locate them on Earth. These bounty hunters are like shape-shifters. They come to earth with no face and they can copy whoever they look at. One in particular copies the face of a rockstar it sees on the T.V. Another copies the town drunk; Charlie. The Crites eventually terrorize the quiet farm town and the Brown family on their farm. The Bounty Hunters in the meantime blow up anything that moves (not including people) in there search for the Crites. How times do you hear them say,\\" We want the Crites!\\"<br /><br />All in all this is a good movie. You gotta love those cute little critters! One time (not at bandcamp) they join together like transformers and create this huge critter. It's also funny to watch them communicate with each other. Apparently their language can be translated  to english :)<br /><br />The DVD comes with an alternate ending as well as widescreen and full screen formats. Another great addition to the DVD library.<br /><br />My favorite part is when the Critters terrorize the Brown family on their farm. When the Critters have them trapped in a bedroom and Jay Brown (Billy Green Bush from Jason Goes to Hell) fires a shotgun, they Critters seem shocked and one says,\\" They have guns?\\" Another say no, and another shot is fired by the father and kills one of the Critters. That same Critter that wondered, then said a expeditive that I can't repeat. Lets just say it's the curse on the top of the list, lol.
0143038419|5.0|I just finished her book few days ago.I am not much of an avid reader but I happen to lay my eyes on this book and just thought to give it a read. May be because I am from India , I liked the fact that she chose my country as a spiritual destination. Keeping that aside, I think Miss G's book is a good to read for folks who need some healing. Just to make them feel happy that they are not alone in this world. I have seen so many hate reviews and I have only one thing to say, its her personally journey and she wrote what she felt during that time(The intensity of emphathy only goes a certain length) and isn't that what America is all about..Freedom of speech and thought.
B00127RAJY|4.0|I haven't found Jillian's workouts my style so I was hesitant to get this one, but did because of the good reviews.  I don't regret that, this is a good workout and really got me sweating.  The only exception is that I hurt my knee during jumping jacks.  She says 400 pound people do jumping jacks and I'm nowhere near that, but I do have weak knees and they didn't appreciate the jumping jacks.  I modify them now during this workout but go really fast to keep the same intensity.  If I burn 50 less calories, I can live with that as long as I can keep working out and I'm not sidelined because of an injury.<br />This is a great quick workout that really gets the whole body involved and Jillian is less abrasive in it than she normally is.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Well made.  Finishes where the series terminated and tied up loose ends.  Much better than most of the series that just end and leave you wondering what the hell happened to ...?
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|Wonderful songwriting, a triumphant return.......every song is fantastic, less experimenting this time around, which is wonderful news. I agree with the reviews regarding the strange mastering or recording sound of the disc...not bad..just doesn't seem to mesh with the style of songs on here....If you like REM, buy this and for certain by the new Poi Dog Pondering CD, '7\\"...one of the best CD\\"s you will ever hear....your kids will be playing that one as a classic release!
B000JLSLZQ|5.0|The story and music of Phantom of the Opera are amazing whichever the form but this rendition is very well done. Emmy Rossum is phenomenal as Christine. Gerard Butler isn't the best singer in comparison to other men who have played the Phantom, but having Emmy makes up for it. I bought the soundtrack as well and can't stop playing it! I'd highly suggest this movie to anyone who loves musicals.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|American Gangster is a great movie about the rise and fall of a drug dealer in Seventies Harlem.  It reminded me of the movie Blow and also of the classic mob movie Casino.  As is the fashion these days, the movie tries to pack way too much into 2 1/2 hours.  The result is scenes that feel rushed and shallow characters.  Visually, the movie is fascinating, showing a very believable Seventies New York City.  It avoids the dark cinematography that we so often see nowadays that makes you reach for the brightness knob.  While it does fall short of perfection, you won't find many movies better than this.
B000KLRUJS|5.0|This Elektra has been acclaimed since the day it was released four decades ago -- it represents the pinnacle, along with Gotterdammerung, of Solti's collaboration with the Vienna Phil. and Decca producer John Culshaw. Much of Solti's catalog languishes, yet his electro-shock approach, which causes other music to thrash about, is perfeclty suited to Strauss's lurid idiom in Salome and Elektra.<br /><br />The lengthy five-star reviews already give the salient points about Nilsson's commanding assumption of the title role, but attention should be paid to Tom Krause's magnificent Orest -- the two are unsurpassed in the recognition scene. Dazzled as everyone was by Nilsson's power and accuracy, she's also quite touching, a feature of her portrayal often overlooked. Marie Collier is shaky in her singing of Chrysothemis, yet her quavery tone makes her sound movingly vulnerable.<br /><br />As to the sonics, unlike Solti's Rosenkavalier, this opera has always sounded good on CD, but its latest remastering (done for a Solti Strauss edition in the 90s) is warmer and softer on top. In any case, this is the Elektra every collection should contain.
0767821629|4.0|This visual pleasure was seriously overshadowed by the Matrix that came out the same year. Unlike the other masterpiece, which was armed with an ambition of an epic in cinema, The Thirteen Floor is more creative in that there is no self-righteous mission of an entire population to fight against the Internet. There is no immediate indication that leads the audience to the division between physical reality and the virtual one--at least not until the latter half of the film. Instead, what it presents to us is layers of virtual reality, or illusion, if you may. But it also can be understood as infinite layers of reality, depending on precisely how you interpret it. Besides all these philosophical headaches and debates on metaphysics, what is most important is it is an intriguing story--with amazingly hot actors and actresses. It would be a shame to miss it.

B0013BNY2Q|4.0|I'm sick of the complaints about the production of this album. To me it sounds raw and alive. It reminds me of Pavement or Sonic Youth. Overproduced music grows tiresome. On Accelerate it sounds like the band just plugged in and played. This album has a live feel which is very  refreshing. Is it the best album they've ever done? No, but it's still pretty solid. People are always trying to turn music into some kind of science. Music is art! It doesn't have to be perfect. Throw some paint on the canvas and let it run!
0345451325|4.0|Eric Nylund wrote a book called Halo: Fall of Reach. It is a very good book and all through it you can't wait to see what happens next. I think if the made books more based on the games the series, it would be much better than it ever would be I think It's about a group of highly trained soldiers called Spartans after the Spartans at Thermopylae over 2500 years before the books timeline.    I think that it's a great book because it's a non-action book. It starts with a Woman named Dr.Hasley who finds children to have for The Spartan II program, and they have to go through many surgeries to become the super soldiers they are. The main character is John, one of the children picked for the Spartan II program. After the first big mission John became the Master Chief, the best of all the Spartans. As the book progresses John and his Spartans encounter an alien race called the Covenant, an enemy of the UNSC.     The message I see is that no matter who or what you lose you have to keep going especially in combat because if you don't you'll end up dead, like your friend.
B00030590I|3.0|A sumptuous, beautiful movie with a disturbing philosophy.    ***SPOILER ALERT***  All the remarkable, beautiful, talented people die. The nameless, faceless mass triumphs. The Hero agrees that that is good.     The Borg won. Resistance is futile. You will be assimilated.
0307237702|5.0|When i first started this book i wasnt sure if this might going to bore me. I am interested in politics but im not paying attention to all the details and such. This book explains a lot of stuff, is very well written and very interesting. The solutions he has make sense to me and I agree with a lot of the things he has to say. what I like about him is that, he is not trying to convince you that he is right. He stays very objective and explains simply how things are. I suggest this book actually to everybody esp. to all Americans.
B000P12LWY|4.0|OK, first of all, John Rhys Meyers would be better cast as Anne Boleyn than the tall, broad shouldered, barrel-chested, flowing-haired, football-playing, athletic Henry VIII.  And why make up stories when the material you have to work with is so juicy?  Why roll Henry's two sisters into one when they were so fascinating (one smart and plain, one beautiful, both shrewd)?    The real jewel here is Maria Doyle Kennedy.  Her presence is awe-inspiring, as was the historic youngest daughter of Ferdinand & Isabella.  And the costumes ... we don't get enough period-costume pieces anymore.
B000SMWUPS|4.0|Got this neat organizer basket for 2008 my Peg Perego Aria OH since it does not have a parent tray. I really love that I can fold my stroller with the basket still attched. It works pretty good, seems sturdy to hold all my goodies, and holds lots of stuff. There is a side zipper pocket for valuables, 2 cupholder spots which are elastic, and a main space for other things. The velcro straps are adjustable to fit many different size stroller bars. The only bad thing I can think of is that it doesn't stay perfect like the picture indicates, could be the way the Aria handles are, but it tends to slide down sometimes. Overall I am very happy with my purchase and would buy it again if needed!
B000VBP38C|1.0|Bummer, I bought this hd dvd thinking I could watch it on my new hd tv, but could not because my dvd player is not hd!  So now I have this dvd I cannot use.  I re-bought the regular version and of course the story is fantastic, which I already knew.
0307387178|5.0|This book is great.  A very interesting look into the life of someone who wanted to see things without the rose colored glasses.  He wasn't concerned about what color sofa to buy or to make sure he bought a house in a good school district.  He was trying to figure things out about himself.  Love him or hate him, which a lot of people apperently do hate him, he did what he wanted and didn't care what people thought.  If he were still alive, I doubt he would care what you think now.  And I don't blame him.  Well written.  Take it for entertainment value, or don't take it at all...I don't care that much, either.
B000LC4CVA|5.0|Hello !,  For this DVD I am likely to repeat me a little..., but before I will give my direct point of view, which I felt when I put it in reading: Very beautiful image 16/9, sound DTS!... Here all is splendid. set, the symphony orchestra, actors in general!. The voices is smooth but a great control of the spectacle, it are at the same time resting and leave a little the place with the daydream, any fate of the beaten paths!. I appreciated the title: \\"Scarborough Fair\\" well interpreted and... accompanied with harp!... sublime!. Title 13: \\"Lascia Ch' io Pianga\\" of the Baroque!, would not be this of George Frideric Handel?!. I appreciated to see again Mairéad that I could see in truth in a spectacle of Michael Flatley: \\"Feet of Flames\\" a treat. For the continuation, the analysis is very close to the DVD of \\"Celtic Woman\\": Live At the Helix Center in Dublin, Ireland.  Claude.
B000YABIQ6|5.0|I paid for this show on iTunes, and I'd be more than happy to pay for it again on DVD!  The characters are interesting, the stories are fascinating and watching the show is like time traveling.  Buy a copy for yourself, and more for your friends and family.
B0007M22TI|4.0|Hello !,  This musical DVD have a very good level, the artists own a perfect control of their art, some is very young, for example Chloé, which does not prevent it from magnificiently interpreting the first title of this spectacle. It is really splendid. The technical level, the image is a little worse than for the spectacle \\"Live at Slane Castle, Ireland\\", it is very well to have chosen the format image 16/9, the musical sound is correct. I spent a good moment!.  Claude.
0689865384|5.0|This is part of my favorite series, each book as good  as the other but anyway about Uglies.  I really wasn't into much sci-fi or futuristic kind of books, I mean I'd read a few and it was never really my favorite but this book is amazing.  I'm not really good about summarizing stuff and I'm always afraid to give away too much but it's pretty much about this girl named Tally Youngblood who lives in the future.  In the future you are considered \\"ugly\\" until your 16 when you get a surgery to make you \\"pretty\\" and they have two different towns for the uglies and the pretties.  All Tally's friends have become pretty already except her, so one night she meets this girl Shay who does something that pretty much makes the whole story.  Yeah sorry that wasn't very good (the summary) yeah but the book rocks
B0010358D0|4.0|Well, this movie is great but still the same animation and not a complex history. The features were GREAT and also the audio and subs options were extemely complete... this is a must.

B000YDOOUK|4.0|It's about time that old-school rock makes a comeback and these guys \\"bring it\\"!  I can oly listen to so much copy-cat, new-school rock like Breaking Benjamin, Nickelback, Seether, etc.  These guys rock old-school style -- no-nonsense, straight ahead rock and roll.  Yeah, they resemble AC/DC a bit, but they have their own sound!
B00104QSOM|3.0|Daniel Day-Lewis' Best Actor Oscar was well deserved, as was the film's award for cinematography. But the ending of this film, which is supposedly about the ultimate destruction of a conjoined capitalist/fundamentalist Christian nightmare, could have been handled better. Homicide by bowling pin? On the private bowling alley of a besotted, antisocial oil man?     Yes, this is the viewer's reward after watching two-and-a-half hours of a beautifully-shot, wonderfully-acted tempest between one man and everybody else. I'll have to read Sinclair's novel \\"Oil!\\" before I render my final verdict, but I was a tad disappointed by the film.
0471702188|4.0|A good book when dealing with project or company valuation. However, I feel many of the subjects are not dealt with enough detail. All in all, it is more than enough  for a general knowledge on valuation.
B000002B7O|1.0|First of all, I had both vinyls (blizzard of ozz, diary of a madman) in the eighties, but sadly I sold, trade and/or lost them.<br /><br />Tired of having sucky bad-compressed mp3s in my PC, I decided to order them both by Amazon. Let's have both CDs! I saw that these were the 95 reissues (with Lee Kerslake & Bob Daisley in the rythm section). I says here: original CD reissues from 1995. Good deal because you can't find them anywhere.<br /><br />But - alas! - I received those goddamned 2002 versions with Sharon & Kelly on bass and drums!<br /><br />Like we say in my good ol'town: Punked!
B0010358CG|4.0|The first Appleseed film (from 2004) was quite a treat.  The cell-shaded CG graphics looked very good for the time.  Complementing this obvious standout aspect was an intriguing story and an excellent soundtrack.  It's worth noting that the story, in particular, felt like a genuinely original re-animation of sci-fi concepts.    Fast forward to today and we have the sequel, Ex Machina.  It's pretty simple to separate what works and doesn't in Machina:    GRAPHICS:  The level of detail in the graphics has improved dramatically, and characters look less like geometric objects with textures painted on and more like genuine people.  The cityscapes are even more impressive.  Furthermore, the action is more frequent and looks even slicker.    My two gripes with the visuals are these: First, in what is all too common in action movies like this, the best scene is the first one.  Hands down.  I don't understand why so many directors feel the need to frontload their movies.  I will say that the movie is less guilty of this than its predecessor.  Second, movement outside of action scenes still looks a bit jerky.  Some might fault mo-cap technology, but for my money, Final Fantasy: Advent Children boasted some mighty believable movement.    STORY/WRITING:  Here's where Ex Machina falls apart.  The story here isn't anything you haven't seen executed better in anime/other entertainment.  Compared to the plot of the first movie- which created a unique sci-fi framework, this one felt like a filler episode.  The villain was cliche, the story far less complex/meaningful than the first, and any intrigue or mystery the story might yet have held was ruined by the horrible writing.  The film tasks itself with letting the viewer in on a number of concepts necessary to the plot, but rather than integrate them seamlessly into the dialog, it bashes the viewer over the head with them.    MUSIC:  The soundtrack wasn't bad- I just didn't notice it most of the time.  This constitutes a slight letdown considering how often I return to the soundtrack from the first movie.    OVERALL: Ex Machina is a sight to behold and warrants a blu-ray purchase.  Just don't expect it to expand much on the ideas introduced in the first Appleseed.

B000002UVX|5.0|Before purchasing Band of Gypsys, I was well aware many people have mixed feelings with this live recording.  Many people, specifically huge Hendrix fans who must own everything he did, feel this is a pretty average live performance overall.  However, I have to disagree *strongly*.  I've heard quite a lot of live albums from 60's and 70's rock musicians, and I really feel Band of Gypsys is right up there with the very best of them.    I can't put into words how surprised I was upon first listen just how CLEAR and magnificent the performance sounds.  I don't even have the remastered version!  Seriously, compared to most live albums released during the same time, this one sounds WAY above average.  I'm really happy about that.    As for Hendrix's guitar playing, that was ANOTHER major surprise to me.  I went in expecting just a few guitar solos here and there, because the reviews led me to believe this album was lacking in guitar playing.  That is NOT true.  There's more guitar soloing going on throughout the album than I ever thought was even possible.  The opening track \\"Who Knows\\" and especially \\"Machine Gun\\" are lengthy tracks with funky rhythm sections and lots and lots of guitar soloing.  Together, these two songs make up over 20 minutes of brilliant guitar playing and memorable songwriting.    The other four tracks are more soulful in vocal delivery, and funky and guitar-dominated, but shorter than the first two tracks.  Shorter doesn't mean worse though, and overall we're talking about 45 minutes of a really spectacular concert from Hendrix.  I'm sure there's better live albums out there from this legendary guitarist, but that doesn't make Band of Gypsys a bad recording in any way, shape or form in my opinion.  Even calling it average wouldn't feel right.
B0013XS8A2|5.0|This album immediately separates itself from the rest of the MO discography because it is truly in the classical genre. Being so, the amazing thing I experienced was that I could still tell that it carried the distinctive Mike Oldfield musical \\"stamp.\\" This showed me that Mike has truly succeeded in creating his own identifiable sound, regardless of genre.    I found the work to be highly enjoyable, profoundly moving and emotionally stirring. Mike has always had the ability to make music sing; to take us on a musical journey that crescendos, then receeds, bending and pulsing as it fills the heart, never the mind - THIS IS MUSIC TO FEEL DEEP DOWN IN YOUR SOUL.    I was not bothered by the initial musical reference to the Tubular Bells theme. To those who it bothers - get over it! It was worked in perfectly and expanded so as to feel new again and fresh. I feel that this work fits in easily and justifiably with his other \\"masterworks\\" - namely Tubular Bells, Ommadawn, Incantations, Tubular Bells II & Songs of Distant Earth. Music of the Spheres now joins this select group for me. All of these works have the touch of genius and mastery and elevate Mr. Oldfield to a lofty position in field of modern music.    From here - where? Who knows. Have we ever been able to predict Mike's next musical step? No - he is his own man and has earned the right to be so. All we can do is be grateful for whatever else he graces us with during his time on this earth.
B0013D8LCW|5.0|What a WONDERFULLY romantic film! Like the other reviewers before me, I was besotted by the film. This is definitely one of the best gay themed movie to come in a long while. Production values, acting, actors were all top notch. Definitely something you would keep as a collector.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|I was so pleased to see a version of Persuasion that was more up-to-date than past versions. I found the acting to be superb and I was quite pelased with the actress portraying Anne Eliott.<br />A good version of a great novel.
B000066C6Z|5.0|Frankly, I think this movie was way better than the airplane flicks. If you haven't seen it, you are missing out. Go get it, watch it, and then watch it again. Every time I put this movie in, I end up watching it about five times in a row--at least.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|There comes a point when even a great film can be over-hyped; when even a marvel of cinema, a masterpiece if you will, will get so much attention and accolades that it becomes `that movie that failed to live up'.  On the outset, while watching `There Will Be Blood' you could come to believe that to be true of this film.  Heralded as PT Anderson's finest film to date and regarded as one of the two cinematic masterpieces of this year past, `There Will Be Blood' has an obligation to deliver.  What is sad is that many people are not aware of exactly what it plans to deliver.  I can see now how backlash can begin, but I'm here to say that `backlash' in this case is undoubtedly undeserved.<br /><br />Paul Thomas Anderson's epic masterpiece (there, I said it) `There Will Be Blood' is not the movie many may believe it to be.  It is a slow and conflicted journey through the desperations and frustrations placed upon us by greed and selfishness.  It exposes the similarities between materialism and religious self-righteousness and it proves that nothing good can come of evil.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is loosely based of off Upton Sinclair's novel `Oil!' but truly it serves as Anderson's very own vision.  Anderson pits oilman Daniel Plainview against religious preacher Eli Sunday in a small town of Little Boston during the turn of the century.  Plainview is a greedy man, a selfish man who will do anything he can to get what he wants, but Sunday is not much different.  Sunday is a man consumed with a fire that matches the determination of Plainview himself.  They are a perfect match; thus they are perfect enemies.<br /><br />The film moves at a slow pace, taking it's time to build and flesh out these characters.  Aside from Plainview and Sunday you have Daniel's son, H.W., a young yet oddly mature boy who takes in much more than one would expect.  As his fathers `business partner', young H.W. stands comfortably at his father's side; a sight that is often as chilling as it is heartbreaking.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that opens with such a savage calm, a feeling of unsettled tranquility.  The score blazing in the distance, Plainview mining for gold; not a word spoken and yet so much is being said.  It ends on a completely different note; one of tranquil savagery; a burst of manic violence that leaves the viewer feeling oddly subdued.  It's such a masterful way to open and close a film; opening in such a way that keeps us on edge and closing in such a way that puts us at ease.<br /><br />Yet another reason why PT Anderson should have won that directing Oscar.<br /><br />The film is masterfully crafted; a film that just fits so beautifully together, each facet connecting nicely with the next.  It's beautifully shot; the Oscar winning cinematography is spellbinding to say the least.  The score is also a huge plus here, lending a helping hand in creating the perfect mood for this piece.  I remember falling in love with Greenwood's score when I first heard it, but hearing it within the confines of this film adds a whole new light to its grace and beauty.<br /><br />And then there is the acting...<br /><br />Much credit has been given to Daniel Day-Lewis for his performance as Daniel Plainview.  He's won just about every award imaginable and has received countless amounts of praise and admiration, for which he has received it with the utmost sincerity and gratitude.  I am here to acknowledge once again his magnificence here.  Day-Lewis completely becomes Daniel Plainview.  He doesn't look like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't sound like Daniel Day-Lewis; he doesn't act like Daniel Day-Lewis.  Daniel Day-Lewis does not exist within this character; only Daniel Plainview is present.  He flawlessly boils to the surface this mans flaws and transgressions, his bolstering greed and domination.  There are moments when you know that this man is thinking the worst and yet all we see is that sly grin and his eyes, those eyes that speak volumes.  This is not just one of the finest performances of the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.<br /><br />Daniel is not without good company though.  There are two other performers here that steal scenes and command attention.  Young Dillon Freasier, who plays H.W., delivers a brilliant performance.  He masterfully creates and otherworldly maturity that chills the bones while speaking barely a word.  Pay close attention to the relationship between father and son; there are volumes to be told.  Of course we have Paul Dano who plays the eccentric Eli Sunday.  His performance is mind-bogglingly good.  There is a scene where he proceeds to expel the arthritis from the hands of one of the members of his church.  It's the first scene where we really get a glimpse into this very complex character.  It's brilliant to say the least and it serves as a masterful building block for what is to come.<br /><br />`There Will Be Blood' is a film that everyone should see.  Everyone should know what they are about to witness first; that way they can really embrace it for what it is.  This is not an action film, nor a thriller in your most conventional sense.  `There Will Be Blood' is quite frankly one of the best character studies I've seen in recent years.  It's a film that flawlessly exposes the inhumanity within humanity and forces the audience to accept the `ugly' within our souls.  As many have noted; this is not a film that wants to be liked.  It will not leave you feeling warm and fuzzy on the inside, but it will leave you with much to ponder, much to think about and contemplate and will thus leave you with much to remember.the year, but perhaps in the history of cinema.

B000286RKW|4.0|A long film about \\"Italian\\" crime in New York in the 1950-1980 period, and a good one at that. It shows the brutality and the extreme male chauvinism of these gangsters who are ready to sell anything, steal anything, kill anyone in order to make money, and as for killing, to satisfy their insatiable thirst for blood, to satisfy their unquenchable hunger for violence. It also shows, rather on the side because it is not the main object, how justice and before it the police are managing their gang-spirit, splitting their unity and getting the weaker ones to become protected witnesses, and it works: these criminals prefer being hidden away by the Justice Department for decades rather than going away in  prison for even longer periods of time. The film is well done: Robert de Niro and Joe Pesci are quite acceptable. Ray Liotta on the other hand appears slightly weak when confronted to the other two, and he has to be since he is the side-kick, and an essential one at that, of both of them. One shortcoming though: even if the police managed to more or less bring the Italians back in line, the film is absolutely silent about the fact that the various traffics and particularly drugs were then abandoned to another mafia, probably even more dangerous, i.e. the Blacks and the Porto Ricans and other Latinos.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris Dauphine, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne & University Versailles Saint Quentin en Yvelines
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Well done conclusion to the TV series. It picked up right where the show stopped and moved on seamlessly. The best part of the movie was that it ended but left the door open for other movies to follow. Just another day at SGC. I like that. Well done indeed. They will,however, have to work around Sam being head of Atlantis should other movies follow. But I nitpick. If you like SG-1, you will love this movie.

0452289963|4.0|I was anxious to explore a new area and this book did not let me down.  The book is very interesting and is easy to read, even for a slow reader like me.  I would highly recommend reading it to anyone who is interested in trying to improve their life and become a better person in general.    In it, Mr. Tolle will help you to understand not only who you are, but why you (and others) act the way you (they) do.  Though he is a very good and clear writer, some of the concepts Tolle presents are difficult to grasp at first.  It's not easy to try and explain how the human mind works, but Mr. Tolle does an outstanding job of it.      This book really makes you stop and think about your entire existence in this world - it's bizarre.  I plan to re-read it soon.

0805079831|1.0|Let me summarize: The fact that HUNDREDS of MILLIONS of people around the world have been lifted out of poverty in the last 2 decades thanks to free market ideas spreading all over the world, that fact doesn't matter. In fact, every country that has adapted free market ideas did much better economically than before. But the author's skewed and very poor economic understanding is.<br /><br />What's even more amazing, is that blaming corrupt governments, stupid decisions of politicians and ridiculous government policies on free market economics seems to be the norm in this factually inaccurate book. Buy this book only to see how propaganda worked in the Soviet Union.
B000EHRVP6|2.0|I applaud this film for actually taking the time to establish the characters, which rarely happens in this type of genre. Usually, we get a brief glimpse of their lives before they are ultimately killed off one by one. However, I really wish it didnt waste 3/4 of the film with a boring plot.   If you love the torture/horror genre, then this will be a dissapointment for you. The true action doesn't beging until about 20 minutes from the end of the movie and by then you are already bored out of your mind. The torture scenes are quite brief actually and while effective, they are nothing truly gut wrenchingly grotesque or even flinching, especially if you are used to watching films like this. Any of the Saw films easily beat Hostel in the blood and gore department and they do it in a wicked and tortureous way. Hostel is not even remotely scary or chilling. There are no jumpy moments. There are no spooky or clever moments. For those who are not used to or dislike this genre, then perhaps this film may affect you. Otherwise, its a forgettable and overrated film.

B00138Z97C|5.0|This is a great set, and a nice anniversary issue to coincide with the 75th birthday of the great Spanish soprano, a truly grand diva and unique voice, maybe the last example of a breed of singers directly connected with the Grand Tradition and a vocal art -of purity of tone, breath control, combination of power and agility, musicianship and refined artistry, not to mention breathtaking pianissimi- that seems to be quite forgotten by today's big media opera stars. Sony has issued in their original jackets, like beautiful mini LPs, most of her RCA recordings and some of her Spanish Columbia recordings released between 1965, year of her first LP for the American company (Presenting Montserrat Caball&eacute;), and 1972. Including Montserrat Caball&eacute; Sings Zarzuela, Songs of Enrique Granados, Strauss Lieder Recital, Verdi rarities, Rossini rarities, Zarzuela Love Duets (with husband Bernab&eacute; Mart&iacute;), Donizetti rarities, Great Operatic Heroines, Caball&eacute; & Verret Duets, and two complete operas, Norma and Salome. Missing are, among others, the complete recordings of Lucrezia Borgia and Traviata. Anyway, a wonderful box-set at a bargain price and, though I had already all these recordings in previous CD incarnations, I secured my copy as soon as I knew of it. And so should you, before it is too late, being a limited edition. Now, if Sony gave the same treatment to the 8 LPs recorded for the Spanish Vergara and Columbia labels not included here  (starting with a superb 1963 Toldr&aacute; recital, her very first LP), I would  be eternally grateful. Almost all of them were released in compilations by RCA France to celebrate Caball&eacute;'s 70th birthday. Sony own now the rights and it would be a wonderful sequel to this set.<br /><br />And now that I'm at it, what about her Verdi Requiem with Pl&aacute;cido Domingo, conducted by Metha? Or her live Gemma di Vergy at Carnegie Hall? Both albums were released by Columbia in the Masterworks series on LP and haven't appeared on CD yet. That's a real crime. What is Sony waiting for?is Sony waiting for?

0452289963|4.0|I bought this book because I enjoy the teachings of Oprah and her experts at life, and this was a book she said someone should read to live a truly full existence and quit causing themselves to not have a good life.     Previously I bought \\"The Secret\\" for this same reason, and am not sure if I agree with everything that book preaches - although it is true I thought of being fat and then later became fat, this may also have had something to do with my refrigerator being too close to my living room. Regardless, though, it was my fault, which I think is the point.     Anyway, I read the New Earth book and I appreciated how it took us on a quotation and story tour of religions, like a religion food court (which I like the idea of - churches are too far apart). I liked it pretty well but I'm not fulfilled yet. I think maybe I need to read it again because Oprah is usually right, especially about spirituality, which she knows a lot about, due to her owning multiple homes and her own business (TV show). She has obviously been successful at finding her Spirit Places and locating houses on them, and knowing her her Authentic Self, which she enhances with shopping.     So anyway, I will keep reading the New Earth until it takes and I am Authentic. I will give it another chance and I look forward to seeing the next spiritual guru Oprah decides can make us quit being so stupid and writing the bad scripts of our tragic lives (I made that up, so don't take it). Vive le Oprah and the bell Tolles for you!
B0013FXWU6|1.0|the packaging almost stopped me from buying this product and once i opened it i wish i could return it. the dvd is not protected at all, it is in a cardboard envelope inside a cardboard cover. the packaging allows for scratches to accumuliate every time you use the disk. it is like a book binder with no pages so it does not close square and will eventually warp. i am extremely disappointed and am not willing to pay an extra $5.00 to get a more traditional package. i truly hope this is not the trend in dvd packaging,  if it is why not just use a paper envelope or better yet just wrap the dvd in celophane tape. i know that i don't buy dvd's for their packaging but i do expect the product to have packaging that allows for the protection of my purchase. are dvd/movie companies so hard up they can't afford a decent case for their product or is this an attemp at making a \\"green\\" statement about a movie about the greedy oil business.
0452287588|3.0|Mr. Tolle will lead many to answers in this book.  It has incredible insight and many truths.  From a Christian understanding, all these things are a part of who we were created to be.  Just \\"being\\" is a gift of God where we commune with the Creator and find direction from him.  I, too, write much as Mr. Tolle does, as if a book needed to be written, but all wisdom comes from God, not from ourselves.  We are the created.  The creator is the author of our souls, of the gifts and purpose we have.  This connection with God comes from Holy Spirit who connects and leads us to God. Oprah once said (she is running the online class relating to this book) that she turned off to her Baptist faith when she heard a preacher say God was a \\"jealous God\\".  Can God be loving AND jealous, of course. He is jealous of things that come between our relationship with him.  God IS love. When you ARE love you need beings to love.  This process of self-discovery is incredible if you use it to allow GOD to speak to you. Practice meditation with a few lines of scripture, called Lectio Divina.  It will boost you understanding far more than relying on yourself and your own inner guidance for truth.    A great book to read and compare with this is a light spiritual disciplines book called \\"Sacred Rythms\\".  It was life changing for me in the way this is for many.
B000N3AXQU|4.0|My husband and I had both seen most of the Rocky films.  Actually, I think he saw them all, and I saw the first 3.  I really didn't expect this one to be all that good and mainly got it because (1) our son and his fiance live in Philly where it's filmed and (2) for nostalgic purposes.<br /><br />We were pleasantly surprised!  Stallone is looking a little worse for wear, but he carries off the part of Rocky very well.  As he says, \\"he still has a little junk in the basement.\\"  Against his son's wishes, he decides to come out of retirement and get his license to box.  His timing happens to coincide with a video match between him at his prime and a young boxer who has never really been challenged.  That young boxer's promoter asks Rocky to do an exhibition match....it's not supposed to be real.  But Rocky being Rocky, he trains for real and ends up fighting a legitimate fight against the \\"young gun.\\"  Both walk away better off for the match.  And, of course, we get to hear the Rocky theme music!<br /><br />The film keeps your attention, including one part where the sort-of love interest in his life asks him why he's being so kind to her and her son (who were abandoned by the father)....she says, \\"you don't owe us anything.  Why are you being so nice?\\" and He responds, \\"Why you got to owe somebody to get something?\\"  Typical Rocky.<br /><br />If you liked the earlier Rocky films, I think you'll like this one.  It may not be an Oscar winner, but there are some funny parts, some philisophical parts and some good entertainment.  Definitely worth watching!
B000X7SC1O|1.0|This dvd is of the poorest quality I have ever seen. It was almost unintelligible and it appeared to skip around as well. It was very difficult to see the film and the overall experience was extremely disappointing. I had wanted to see the film again before I saw the new stage play on Broadway and this was most unsatisfactory. While at the theater I purchased a much better version of the same film on dvd which is perfectly legible and which also has extras and is very clear. This particular version should be taken off the market.
0887308589|5.0|Absolutely hysterically tearfully gaspingly chokingly hilarious. But also a very accurate depiction of how the business world can be - now THAT is scary!
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is my absolute favorite, have watched over and over again. Falling for Rupert Penry-Jones over and over again.  Great romantic movie.
192076920X|5.0|This book was completely over-the-top, but fortunately I love that sort of writing. The situations and events which Lin lives through are thrilling, tragic, inspiring and, at times, utterly ridiculous. Beautifully written, although there are moments where the smack or lovesickness-induced philosophising goes a little too far. Highly recommended (probably the most enjoyable novel I've read in the last decade), provided you're able to suspend your disbelief for long enough to get through it.
B000TGCR4C|5.0|Thank you Paul,another blockbuster,who the(beep)  is Spielberg???    Great movie ,superb plot ,just see it!
0375704027|1.0|I can't believe that this is supposed to be one of Murakami's best works. It is extraordinarily dull, even for him. The usual (perhaps \\"original\\", since  it's an early work) self-absorbed Holden Caulfield-esque protaganist, the usual self-conscious references to Western literature and music (is this why Murakami was so popular in Japan, because he refers to painfully often to the \\"exotic\\" West?), the usual UN-selfconsciously misogynistic perspectives of human relationships. I suggest you try Wind Up Bird Chronicle, then give up on this author altogether.
0143038419|1.0|I have never encountered such an astonishingly self-cenetered creature in print before. I was embarrassed for her and for myself during the entire first chapter that anyone would see her mission in life as cutesy commentary on everything in the universe. She really thinks she has discovered Italy and she is very smug about how she is the only one who can adequately describe it. Egocentric? This person shacked up with her lover and destroyed her marriage and and comes out the victim and has to travel all over the world to reward herself - and on and on and on and on. PLEASE save yourself the money and take my book FOR FREE! Just pay the postage.
1400079276|2.0|Don't waste your time reading this tripe. I suggest you try Wind Up Bird Chronicle, which is quite a decent, if rather twisted, read, then give up on Murakami completely.
B00006I53S|5.0|I will not go into detail with any specifications, just the most important information, in my opinion, to most photographers, beginners or advanced.  This lens is superb! The durability, quality, and sleekness of the lens are great! The color quality, the image stabilizer and the clarity of all my photos are beyond my expectations.  I love this lens!!
0061122416|1.0|This book was utterly appalling. The characters were one-dimensional, the dialogue inane, the plot both dull and choppy. I was expecting, at the least, some coherent and consistent philosophy behind the events in the story: as to the nature of personal destiny, the order of the universe, the existence and/or workings of true magic, SOMETHING! But instead, it read as if different authors had written various chapters without even consulting one another - the whole thing didn't really make much sense at all. Abysmal.
B000TGCR38|5.0|I don't watch too many foreign films, but if you can get past the two step thought process of reading AND watching, this is a must see.Even if you are not of Dutch decent(which I am)this movie will keep you at the edge of your futon. C'mon it's Paul Verhoven for garsh sake. Is he gonna let you snooze? NO!!
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Absolutely amazing!!!  This wraps up the major storyline and was thoroughly entertaining.  If you were even remotely interested in the television series and you are familiar with the storyline in the final season, this is a no-brainer must buy.  Unfortunately it leaves a lot of questions that were unaddressed over the years still hanging.  Maybe the next direct to DVD movie will close some of those holes or hopefully they will continue with even more in the future.  That would be nice.
B0016OAUGS|5.0|I can't wait for it to come out. Even tho it was going to be out today :( but anyway i am guessing the wait will be worth it!!
1881273156|4.0|I thought this was an outstanding book that helped me to understand how to better relate to the person I am currently in a relationship with.  I would recommend this to any couple wether they are having problems or not.  A very easy read.
B0013FXWU6|5.0|I have now seen this film twice. It was just as good the second time. The acting, direction, photography and music was flawless. This is one of the best movies I have ever seen, and I've seen plenty. It unfolds like a dream and ends like a nightmare. It pulled me in completely. My faith that good movies are still being made has been restored.
B000BTC5LW|5.0|I watched this concert several times during the several past years and having it on DVD format displayed on a 48\\" LCD screen with a 1,200 watts 5.1 sound system is what I have been waiting for sooooooo long.    This is a must have for Pink Floyd fans.    The presentation, extra features and quality of video and sound is great.    I wanted to rate it 10 stars but 5 was the highest... very well deserved.
0316001821|4.0|I loved this book and couldn't put it down once I started reading it.  Unlike some of the other people who have posted comments here, I must say that I connected with the characters in this novel from the very beginning.  Sebold makes the grief that this family endures, particularly the father's, palpable.  Anyone who has a young child can feel the weight of the father's loss as he sits in his den remembering the moments that he wished he had treasured.  The only reason I did not give the book 5 stars is because the book does get a bit long toward the end.  All in all, however, a terrific read.
8489367116|5.0|i finished reading this book recently after it was recommended by a friend. once i started it, i could not put it down. i was totally absorbed in the story and thought that it was fantastic, relevant and sincere. Anyone who has the slightest interest in humanity, the role and the roots of Islam, the meaning of suffering in the world and the significance of spiritualism has to read this book. i recommend it with my full endorsement.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|Perhaps it's just an editor's/writer's fantasy....I would have removed the characters of Jesus (completely unnecessary) and Delphino (ditto).  I also would have made somewhat more of a coherent narrative, although I might concede the necessity of absurdist scenes like 'Gutterballs.'    There's plenty to like, though:  the chameleon actor Jeff Bridges, a native of L.A., is perfectly suited to the role of the Dude; the Stranger is not totally necessary, either, but he is wonderful; Steve Buscemi and John Goodman are hilarious, especially the latter, with his constant refrains about Vietnam; and then there are the usual hijinks and screw-ups related to kidnapping and other crimes for which the Coen Brothers seem to have a very strong affinity.
B000002JSN|5.0|Physical Graffiti is a great album and it is definitely a classic. Sure, it's overrated but what classic album isn't.   Anyway the first song that should get honorable mention here is `In My Time of Dying'. It is a powerful song traditionally arranged by Zep from the `deep south of America' as Plant puts it. The song is epic, no doubt about that, a bit overlong, yes, but defiantly a great jam session for the boys. This and `Trampled Underfoot' are both great jams. Put this is what people don't understand about Zep. They are a great jam band, and two songs out of the 15 on this album show their love for jamming. To me length in a jam is justified if a band is good.   `Kashmir' is pretentious but it's so hard NOT to like this song. It's epic, it's full of energy and has great hooks courtesy of JPJ on string arrangement and Jimmy Page's classic riff. The drums are powerful. The singing is great too. When Plant wails \\"Ooo Ooo Yeahy-yeah\\" it's a hook is it not!? It's fantastic.    `In the Light' I immediately loved since I first heard it. It's dark but it has a sense of hope toward the end of the song. It's a shame they never played this live. The riff is one of my all time Zep faves, and the way those middle eastern style keyboards are played by JPJ are incredible. `Ten Years Gone' took some time for me to get used to. It lacks a great melody but it does have a good one. The lyrics in the song are a bit odd because Plant tries to incorporate the sexual innuendo with a touching ballad and it doesn't work. But I can get past it.    The best parts of this album to me are actually the so called \\"filler\\" so many people complain about. I love `Bron-Yr-Aur', `Down by the Seaside', and `Black Country Woman'. `They are so much fun to listen to for the most part. Night Flight' is the worse filler on here tough that song sucks.  To me, songs like 'Bron-Yr-Aur' and 'Black Counrty Woman'  seem to be what Led Zep want to play and dabble in, but they're so fixated on pleasing their fans that they didn't want to get away from all the hard rock that made them famous. Which brings us to the bad side of album.   Jimmy Page's production seems to take a turn for the worse when it comes to the new hard rock numbers. `Custard Pie', `The Rover', `The Wanton Song', and `Sick Again' all seem to have the same dirty production quality that make the album consistent, almost too consistent. So consistent that makes this album, more than any other Zep album hard to listen to in one sitting (length too but that's not as big a factor as people seem to think). `Custard Pie' offers nothing new to the Led Zep catalogue other then the fact that the production and the guitar effect is different. This new distortion sounds dirty, but not huge like it once used to be.  Needless to say all the hard rock songs on here are what bring the album down as opposed to songs like `Immigrant Song', `Black Dog' and \\"Whole Lotta Love' which were the highlights of yesteryear. What happened to Led Zep between 73 and 75? How come Page forgot how to produce hard rock songs? So sure, these songs aren't as good as the great epics of Led Zep's first four albums but they aren't that bad for the most part. There's something about `Custard Pie' and `The Rover' that I can't get enough of, and that's the energy. Jimmy may have simply been trying out a new sound, didn't work for me, but it's the energy coming out of these songs that make it bearable. Of all these hard rock songs `The Wanton Song' is my favorite, the energy here is brought up to the fore and it is felt. The song itself is \\"bad@$$\\" for lack of a better term. \\"Sick Again' though is the worse offender. Bonzo's drums are killer here, but the song seems forced like `Night Flight'. The beginning of the song was lazily recorded and it's a bad ending track in general, leaves one feeling under whelmed.   Overall this is a great album and anyone who's a Zep fan should own it no question.
1400082773|5.0|The most amazing thing about this book is that it was written before Barack became a politician so it includes honesty and forthrightness that we aren't always able to see from our politicians.  This is primarily a memoir/autobiography and the reader has an opportunity to learn about the experiences that have helped form Mr. Obama.  This book is often considered to be about race issues in America and while it is that; it is so much more rich.  Issues of American and global poverty play a prominent role.  Family issues come up again and again as Barack seems to always be discovering new family members and discussing their impact on his life.  Barack obama has lived an interesting life; he's a self-made man, but he hasn't done it all alone.  :)   On the down side, this book could be shortened a little (which Mr. Obama readily admits to in his most recent introduction), but even the parts that could be edited have value and are interesting.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|The Ark of Truth wraps up the whole Ori story very nicely. I'm damned glad I purchased it.  If you're a Stargate fan it's a must see/must have DVD...
B0010YSD7M|5.0|When Season 10 of SG1 ended we already knew there was going to be at least one movie, which was good, since the series finale didn't wrap things up very well. The Ark of Truth is like an extended episode of SG1 that wraps up the Ori storyline with a neat little bow. The production quality is higher than the already great job that was done on the series, with better effects and bigger and more sets. My only gripe is the lack of guest appearances by Richard Dean Anderson and Don S. Davis (Jack and Gen. Hammond) but they're going to be in Stargate: Continuum, which is going to be the REAL end of the series. Overall, if you're a Stargate fan you need to see this so you know what happens with the Ori, but don't get your hopes up for a grand finale.
0810993139|5.0|This book is the best book I have ever read. It's like reading somebody's real diary. I think it is a spendid, magnificent, outstanding, extraordinary book. If I could I would give it 100 stars!
B000O77RL4|5.0|As the title implies, many words can be used to describe this movie, including slow (not in a bad way at all), deliberate (in a very good way), contemplative, and more.  Fantastic and fascinating also.<br /><br />Letters from Iwo Jima gives those that watch the film the view from the other side of the battle at Iwo Jima, the side that most U.S. citizens (and other persons not of Asian descent) would likely not be aware of.  Clint Eastwood did this film as a companion piece to his much lauded film Flags of Our Fathers.  Flags is a look at the heroes of Iwo Jima.  I won't go into details about that film other than to say once you've seen it you realize that looking at Flags as a film about heroes is not what you wind up left with at the end.  Watch that film and you'll know what I'm referring to.<br /><br />Flags was a telling of the U.S. and Allied side of the events that happened on Iwo Jima, but also much more, including a good long look at the lives of the people that were fighters at Iwo Jima once those people had returned to the U.S. mainland.  While Flags doesn't demonize the Japanese military that was fighting the U.S. and allied forces at Iwo, it doesn't give any real details into the experiences of the other side.<br /><br />Letters gives us a long look into the Japanese military personnnel that served at Iwo Jima.  We get to see how they prepared for the inevitable battle, and how the people on the island faced a destiny they weren't necessarily happy to have to meet.  While many U.S. citizens may think of the Japanese soldiers in terms of willing to fight to the death and gladly lay down their lives in honor of their emperor, the soldiers that served at Iwo were not necessarily people that wanted to do that.  They had family to think of, had home lives they longed to return to, and had been left with little resources and logistical support as they became the last line of defense against U.S. Naval power on the way to the Japanese homeland.<br /><br />As another reviewer notes in their comments, the vast majority of the dialogue for the soundtrack for this film is in Japanese.  Viewers will most likely be watching this film with subtitles on constantly, with those subtitles in U.S. English translating the dialogue and providing the story for those viewers to understand (without having to learn Japanese first ;-) )  Unlike the reviewer that complained about the pacing of the subtitles, I had no issue with how long they were shown on the screen as the conversations flowed.  There was plenty of time to read the subtitle and also take in the images that were shown, and the subtitles weren't distracting for me at all.<br /><br />Though this film is a companion to Flags of Our Fathers, personally I believe this is the better film, and I would note that you really don't need to see either film in order to enjoy or appreciate the other.  Further, I would have to say that perhaps using the word 'enjoy' here is not quite appropriate.  Letters isn't a film that will bring joy for most viewers.  It's not a depressing film, but it's also not an uplifting film.  It documents, in a documentarian style, the events that happened at Iwo Jima, mostly from the Japanese side, and does so without glorifying or villifying war and it's participants.<br /><br />Letters is, in my opinion, a master work and is well worth owning for me.  While it may not be a film that viewers would want to see more than once or twice, it most certainly should be viewed at least once, and somewhat savored for the fine film that it is.<br /><br />One last comment here, relating to the film style used.  If you watch the film on HD DVD (or perhaps Blu-ray) you may feel somewhat offput by the grainy feel of the image used in many places on the film.  That look is intentional and really seems appropriate (to me) for this film.  That look may bother some, but I think it works well as it's used here.mments, the vast majority of the dialogue for the soundtrack for this film is in Japanese.

B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller rocks!! It is easy to manipulate. The best part about it is--- that it's very durable. This controller has been dropped several times and stepped on. I recommend this controller for all serious gamers!
B000W4KT6E|3.0|Not as good as expected.The star lacks\\"Angel\\", I mean making herself loved by the viewer. Some good songs. Travolta is a good actor, but this role could have been played perfectly by a woman. Nothing justifies otherwise. I know that as a Broadway Show this character was also played by a man. Why????
0380789027|2.0|I was very enthusiastic about this short story collection, the first I was reading by Gaiman. My first book by him was Neverwhere and I just loved it, then I read American Gods and just didn´t get it.......at least given the whole success it had...it just wasn´t for me it seems. But S&M really didn´t get my attention as I thought it would, not one short story really got me going or really made me enjoy it.( Except the one with the black cat and the very short poem about Christmas.) I hope no one gets disappointed like me on it, I just think these stories are from a very early era by Gaiman and have not much to do with his more recent style or his novels. If you´re starting with Gaiman I recommend Neverwhere, I don´t think you´re getting anything much better than that one.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I have watched this film 4 times! Love everything about it! I have never heard anything about this movie until Amazon recommended it when I bought Pride and Prejudice. Thanks for the review from the buyers. After viewing most of your messages, North & South has become one of my favorite movies!
B00006FM77|5.0|A MUST for all of us Chicago fans.  Lots of great music on 4 CD's.
B000RZIGVS|1.0|I didnt heed the warnings about this product before buying it. The cases are indeed flimsy and break too easily. I bought this item, the first 2 discs you could hear every background noise, but not the actors/actresses talking...so i returned it and exchanged it for another set...samething...I dont know what paramount is playing at, but with something that has earned them millions you would think they would have invested in something a bit more substantial, and better programming.
B00005IC2H|5.0|I will never be able to give a review of Sigur Ros that can describe what this music does to my entire universe. It is the universe calling out gently for everyone to slow down, listen, weep if you may but listen. Bring your body to a comfortable couch and lie down as Sigur Ros takes you out of this world and into the truth we left behind when we grew up. Being a mother,I could imagine this being the soundtrack of a baby's journey in the womb from conception to birth. In fact, I would recommend mothers (to be and those who are now) to play this music to get your baby to sleep and just to bring that peace and serenity into your day, your night, your life. Sigur Ros, I love you all so much! This is the music of love and life...did that sound too dramatic? Sorry can't help it...this is awesome music.
B0015AARJI|5.0|Finally the dualshock is back, and this time better than ever (wireless, with sixaxis). There is no doubt the rumble adds alot of fun to gameplay. The controller itself is heavier and feels just right. I didn't notice any problems in battery life, got about 8 hours so far and still has full bars. This also works with all PS1/PS2 games (requires firmware 2.00).  I tried this with uncharted and warhawk so far, both games uses the rumble feature perfectly.  Even though i beat uncharted already, this time i really found it a lot better with rumble. I reccomend this for all PS3 owners, and especially if you're getting the one and only MGS4.
B00003CWN3|2.0|When this movie first starts, it doesn't seem like it is going to be too bad; but as it progresses, it becomes worse and worse.  More violent and more sexually violent.  By the end, I wished I had not watched it.  Hillary Swank did a tremendous acting job, but sometime I think some things are better left not done or known.
B000002B5L|5.0|New Jersey has produced some fantastic musicians. after all we are the second wealthiest state in this country, and yet we have some of the poorest cities. When the Fugees produced this album they gave a voice to the city of Newark., and in the process created a masterpiece. Great Production by Pras. bits of Clefs guitar and Hills vocals make for a nice flow.  Hopefully Hill can overcome her Bi-Polar disorder and reunite.
B0010ZR160|3.0|This movie wasn't the best movie I have ever seen, but wasn't the worst either.  It pretty much kept your interest throughout, but kind of drug in a few places.  It is okay for a Friday night at home.
B00002E23E|5.0|Where to begin?  This is FILM. If you can't tell video from film, you need to do some homework. This film shows peter grant, roy harper, the bands' families, many people whom have passed away, divorced, or just disappeared. If you don't know zep well, this won't help, but if you understand aleister crowley, the arts, the seventies, and magic, this will click unlike the VIDEO TAPE of later shows. Younger fans will probably not understand, but for those of us who were there, nothing like the real thing.  May you find the occulted experience and humor in this film rewarding, it's there, IF you have the eyes/ears for it.

0060273224|5.0|I would love to see a good movie made based on this book. Am I the only one? The book is great, the best of the Trilogy. It has all it needs to become a major movie, if the right people are involved.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|True to life portrayal of what takes place in the \\"underground world\\" while everyone else goes about their suburban business. Here the movie shows us how the \\"arms dealing\\" involves the politician, suburbian housewife, immigrants and poor youths living in developing countries. We get to see who does most of the work, who benefits and the danger it involves for those at the less powerful end of the equation. I can't quite call this entertainment....nothing to laugh about here. The five stars are for the acting (Nicolas Cage rocks) and the story telling.
B000FVQYYK|5.0|To say that this album is diverse would be a bit of an understatement. From the opening track \\"Take a Bow\\" to \\"Knights of Cydonia\\" at its end (incidentally, this was the song that prompted me to buy the album), Black Holes and Revelations takes you on a nearly-fifty-minute musical roller coaster ride, with each track bringing a different, new sound, and yet being done in such a way that it all fits nicely together. All in all I felt that it was extremely well done, and a very pleasant album to listen to. Not having heard much of their previous work, this album has triggered my interest and I'm now intending on exploring what their past albums have to offer.

0393061310|5.0|The Aborigines of Australia built mankind's first known watercraft 40,000 plus years ago, yet today they are the most primitive stone age people of any continent. Why is that?    Did the mother of invention arise from people living in harsh tropical/desert climates forced to invent in order to survive? Or did it arise in colder climates more readily because people were trapped in their warm home with nothing else to do but experiment? Was it both?    Most critics of this book sound to me like they have only read the summary on the back of the book. Their arguments are preconceived.    Even if you are one of those critics, read it. Disagree with it afterwards if you still want to, regardless I think it will add new perspective to human history for you. If you decide you want to write your own book based on how genetics and anthropometry shaped human history, by all means do so. I'd gladly read that too.     But don't just shrug if off before hearing him out. That's selfish cynicism and counterproductive to scientific understanding.
0425210480|4.0|Clive Cussler is now an industry and he pumps out books with regularity and with a certain rythmic quality. Every one of his books has the same pattern: start off with a chapter that looks at an historical event (that is fictional) which normally means that some ungodly secret is hidden. Move to current times when the secret is unearthed by dastardly bad guys who want to take over the world. Next comes the team who uncover the plot by being in the right place at the right time and suffering through some bizarre events. The team figures out what is going on, manages to upstage the bad guys, and kills them. Oh, and the team leader gets the girl - very important part.<br /><br />In this case - Polar Shift - the historical secret is some sort of discovery where you can cause not just a magentic polar shift, but an actualy physical geological shift which will destroy the world. The bad guys are a collection of anarchists - who are brilliant scientists, of course - and a shadowy person who is using the anarchists in his attempt to take over the world.<br /><br />The team is Kurt Austin, Joe Zavala and the Trouts. They happen to come across this plot because Kurt is leading a charity kayak race when the mad scientist happens to run a test that backfires in the exact same waters; the Trouts happen to be right in the center of a several-miles wide whirlpool in a zodiac, and they manage to swirl around the rim of the whirlpool for long enough to have Kurt and Joe pluck them away in a helicopter, seconds from when the whirlpool collapses, etc.<br /><br />The girl is one of the unique twists in this book. She goes after Kurt rather than the other way around as we saw in all the previous books.<br /><br />Throw in some expeditions to islands in northern Siberia, woolly mammoths, tsunamis, ancient crystal cities in the bowels of extinct volcanoes, high tech gadgetry, and murderous thugs and you have a typical Cussler book.<br /><br />So, given that all of this stuff is so generic, why do I give this book 4 stars? Because it is a fun read!!! It is a perfect book for a flight or two. You do not need to think too much about the contents, since you know how things will play out, you can simply enjoy the thrills and spills knowing that the world will be saved in the end!<br /><br />Some of the plot lines were actually more bizzare than normal and I was hoping for resolutions - but was disappointed. What seems like a major idea (the woolly mammoths) completely dissipates and fizzles out at the end as does the whole ancient crystal city. Too bad, there seems to be the idea of a great Clive Cussler story in those ideas!!use it is a fun read!!! It is a perfect book for a flight or two.

B00005QB42|5.0|Great sound for Massage...I am a massage therapist. Also great for yoga or meditation. Nothing to abrupt or intrusive. Such a hypnotic sound!! The chanting is much more condusive to relaxation as opposed to some of her stuff with mitten, which is wonderful, but more for easy listening rather than meditative. The non-englsh (Is that a word?) allows you to not attach to the images evoked by our language.
0321344758|4.0|Many of Krug's findings are very true and helpful to analyzing the effectiveness and usefulness of a website!  I appreciated the short length of the book, but at times still found myself skimming some parts.  Overall a  worthwhile read!
B0001XAPY2|4.0|This was an awesome Miyazaki film. It was racy, adventurous and fully entertaining for the very young to the very old. I loved it. The plot involves the misadventures of a sea plane pilot whose face has been mysteriously turned into a that of a pig. The movie is pretty void of clichés. An excellent choice.
B000ZLFALI|3.0|A movie comprised of somewhat disjointed scenes and circumstances to accomodate the Beatles catalog. Granted it's nice to hear the Fab Four again, albeit by other artists. Entertaining at times, but lacks any continuity of thought. If you're ADD this might be your pick of the year.
B000Z66RSS|5.0|i loved the first step soundtrack, but i think this one is better! i find myself always wanting to listen to it.  i was unsure about all the different peolpe that they had on this cd, but i love every song now that i have listened to it!
1596912855|3.0|This book was such a departure from the usual book by this author.  I did not really enjoy the book.  It was not what I have come to expect from her and I have loved all of her other books.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Another amazing addition by Joss Whedon. Firefly is an amazing show with a wonderful story. It takes us on a journey to another world in the company of very lovable characters that we can't help but form our own connection with.    If you loved watching Buffy and Angel, you will LOVE this! =)
B0013BNY2Q|3.0|3 1/2 stars. I think this album is good in it's own right which is really how it should be judged.  If you are a fan like me(since Fables) you can definitely see odds and ends from previous songs and of different styles from their past.  Nothing really new here.  Definitely not reminiscent of any one album.  Absolutely love the energy of Living Well, Man Sized Wreath, and Accelerate.  Houston, Until the Day is Done are reminiscent of classic slower tempo songs and are very listenable.  Submarine sounds like one of better UP/Reveal songs and Mr. Richards is the closest thing to old IRS R.E.M. (in my opinion).  The last two songs are just ok.  If there were any songs that sounded like attempts to 'sound like R.E.M.' these would be my picks.  That is my first impression anyway.  You can just turn these up for the jam effect.  Also, like many have mentioned the distortion in the recording is a little annoying at first.  In particular the vocals get kind of lost in the distortion on the up tempo songs.  I think Michael's voice has suffered at little through the years but still love it's distinctness and emotion.  It's one of the things that make R.E.M. great.  All in all I'm quite happy with this release.  One more strong song at the end and it would have gotten 4 stars.
B000BNTM96|5.0|I am a huge fan of QOTSA, but I have sadly never made it any of their shows. My friends who have been were not impressed, so I had low expectations. I suppose the venue they saw them at must have sucked, because these discs are freakin priceless! My only complaint is that the CD is lacking Avon, Feel Good Hit, and Fun Machine. The versions of No One Knows and Long, Slow Goodbye are fantastic. If you like QOTSA, there is no excuse for you not to own this.
B00127RAJY|5.0|These workouts are brief but tough.  When the going gets tough, the tough get going.  You will work hard and sweat, but you will be glad you did.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|This album demolishes the expectations laid down by both their previous album and their live show. This album is magnificent from start to finish, working as a complete cycle. Cassandra Gemini gives a close approximation of their live show, yet drags a little in the middle. They should have replaced some of the noodling with the missing title track. That being said, this disc definitely functions as a true \\"album\\", and has the most psychedelic feel to it. Not for the faint of heart, but the most rewarding in my opinion.
B000P12LWY|5.0|From the talented pen of Michael Hirst (Elizabeth, Elizabeth: The Golden Age) comes the Showtime series, 'The Tudors'.    Although not entirely historically accurate, 'The Tudors' is one of the most entertaining adaptations of the early reign of King Henry VIII to grace the small screen.    Set on location in Ireland, the lush countrysides, grand architecture, and lavish costumes provide the perfect setting for the salacious and deliciously decadent life of the Tudor Royal Court and it's cast of characters.    Speaking of characters, the casting is simply divine. With fine performances from all involved. Most notably, Sam Neill as the corrupt, manipulative Cardinal Wolsey, and Maria Doyle Kennedy as the faithful, ever-gracious Queen Katherine. Both deliver the dialogue-heavy script perfectly, adding great depth to their characters, whilst laying the foundation for the main leads of King Henry VIII (Jonathan Rhys-Meyers) and Anne Boleyn (Natalie Dormer) to shine.    Indeed, Rhys-Meyers and Dormer do just that. With their verbal and non-verbal games of cat and mouse, which extend beyond the bedroom into the public arena's of politics, Church, and social convention, the viewer is tantalised and teased every step of the way.    Having seen both adaptations of Gregory's novel, 'The Other Boleyn Girl', I can safely say that Dormer is the best Anne Boleyn hands down. Her portrayal of Anne's veracious ambition and womanly charms complement the rebellious, seemingly untameable King Henry to a tee.    So enough superlatives! If your a lover of period dramas and seductive storylines, I highly recommend 'The Tudors' Season One. I guarantee that it will whet your appetite over and over again.
B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Much has been said of Nick Oliveri's ouster from the group and the reprecussions thereof, but this album reaffirms how unnecessary he is. The opener is a dark, quiet tune with Mark Lanegan providing some of the most haunting vocals I have ever heard. As soon as it has started, it is done, only to initiate the musical carnage. The disc loses momentum halfway through, but closes very well with \\"Long, Slow Goodbye\\". Even though it's not their best disc, it is well worth picking up.
B00008LDPU|3.0|this animated movie didnt add up to my expectations. seems to me at times it let way off the matrix series and wanted to prove to be better. i would have loved to see just a animated version of all matrix movies rolled into this movie. but i expected too much i guess
B00004TH6O|5.0|This disc opens with the monster, \\"Feel Good Hit of the Summer\\", and keeps youy guessing all the way through. My favorite is \\"Into the Fade\\", with vocals courtesy of rock god Mark Lanegan. The only filler is the Oliveri tune \\"Quick and to the Pointless\\", but at least he makes it up with \\"Autopilot\\". Not my favorite QOTSA disc, but also necessary.
0553270435|1.0|This is just a bunch of made up stories!! Don't get this one!! Did not work for me!! Had to trash it.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I think the success of this album is due to its seemless transition from ATDI to what is to come later. There is little that you can fault this album with. It definitely stands out from the rest of TMV's albums due to the tight and slick production. There is nothing wrong with that, but this album only hints at the grand experimentation that is to come. The dueling guitars in Cicatriz ESP alone are worth the price of admission. Everything else is just icing on the cake. If you can survive this album, there is hope for you yet...
B000V6S6V8|5.0|It's always an interesting experience to be able to strip away the layers of what make up a successful band.  To see what each member contributes individually.  After slowly coming into his own as a songwriter with his first solo album, 2003's [[ASIN:B00009KTWU Paper Monsters]], as well as contributing three tracks to Depeche Mode's excellent 2005 release, [[ASIN:B000B2YQX4 Playing the Angel]], DM frontman, Dave Gahan, continues his aspiring legacy with his second solo effort, 2007's  [[ASIN:B000VT6FAO Hourglass]]. Focusing this time on the more electronic elements that he has always been associated with, Mr. Gahan gives listeners a very dark and edgy world, of his own creation, in which to inhabit.  Gone are the more elegantly crafted pieces of music from fellow DM bandmate, Martin Gore, which are replaced by some extremely raw and aggressively edgy material.        Hourglass opens strongly with the orchestral accompanied [[ASIN:B00103BSNO Saw Something]], a track with beautifully haunting melodies combined with Gahan's own alluring vocalizations, with just a bit of cool guitar licks to give it that classic feel.  There's a longing and even slight desperation evoked from Gahan here, trying not to give into the emptiness of life (\\"After the storm had passed, I wondered how long the break in the clouds would last?\\") and instead embrace the possibilities of a much brighter future.  (\\"I sit and I wait and I stare...Still wishing for a divine intervention to lift me from my chair\\")  The song, which became the 2nd single from the album, is easily one of the best tracks here, and one Dave should be very proud of.  A music video, which was shot in slow motion, features Dave waking up from bed, getting dressed and walking out of his hotel.  A sexy brunette (dressed in black) and an elderly woman with a dog are also filmed.  The video transitions from slow motion to real time once Gahan leaves the building.  Strange, yet still interesting.        Next comes [[ASIN:B000VKLS28Kingdom]], the first single from the album, with Gahan, in his element, doing what he does best.  Those heavy electronic chords, fast beats and catchy harmonies, all come together perfectly, showcasing Dave's hypnotically effective and sexually aggressive vocals (\\"I have that desperate feeling and trouble is where I'm going to be...I know you hear me knocking, so open the door and set me free\\") as he ponders the meanings of life (\\"If there's a kingdom behind it all, is there a God who loves us all?) love, (\\"Do we believe in love at all?\\") and his own intellectual insecurities & sensibilities (\\"I'm still pretending I'm not a fool\\") at their most simplistic levels.  It's another fantastic track by Mr. Gahan.  A music video was also made, with Dave, getting out of his car at an indoor parking lot, highlighting his mouth, which is lit up brightly from the inside as he sings.  An empty town is also photographed at dusk with the lights from houses and cars flickering in different colors.  Again, strange, yet still interesting.        Now Dave's aggression is heard full throttle, with the third track and final single from Hourglass, [[ASIN:B0010YD1Z6 Deeper & Deeper]] .  The song is fuelled by a powerfully testosterone (even masochistically) laden dominance in Gahan's need to be strongly sexual and in control of the woman he desires. (\\"I'm gonna have you when I want to...I'm gonna take you, that's what I like...I'm going down now, deeper and deeper, under your skin...You know that it's right\\") This primal, animalistic nature is done to such a degree that some may wonder if Dave has possibly gone too far? (\\"You can't tell me that you don't want it...You know that I like it when you put up a fight...I'm gonna have you when I want to...I'm gonna take you, that's what I like\\")  But this may be entirely the point he is making, that the need for being in complete control (by being completely out of control) will ultimately cost you dearly...losing everything in the end, and controlling nothing. A person's enjoyment of the song may have much to do with their own values and sense of worth. The music itself is also highly fast and aggressive and doesn't let up for a second.          \\"Use You\\" is a cool sounding little tune with an urgency from Gahan involving what appears to be discontentment, manipulation, maybe even claustrophobia, depending on how you look at it. (\\"It's killing me to be in this room, I've gotta get out, I've gotta get out soon...I'm hurting you with everything I do...It's too long, too long in this place\\")  The song may have actually been chosen for the fourth single, but Dave had to cut things short in order to join DM in the studio to start working on their next album.  There are a couple of official remixes of the song floating around that are really good and give some idea of the songs further potential.        \\"Insoluble\\" highlights Dave at one of his most vulnerable moments (just listen to the way in which he sings the line, \\"My Angel\\"), regretting his past actions, which may have ended an important relationship. (\\"I should have listened when you were mine...It could be too late, I've already crossed the line\\") What's interesting about the song is that as Dave confesses his sins, looking for forgiveness, you hear his inner voice as background vocals singing the words \\"Insoluble,\\" which he then cuts off by singing \\"You have nothing to fear.\\"  It's sort of reminiscent of \\"Clean,\\" from 1990's Violator in that respect.  Saying one thing, yet thinking something completely contradictory.  The song then connects to the next track, with the sound of wind blowing, as another wonderful song, \\"Endless,\\" begins to play.  Dave has always succeeded in drawing in his listeners with his seductive voice work, and what he does here on \\"Endless,\\" with it's nicely laid beats and rhythms, is no exception.  (\\"In the cold of the full moon, on this night...Time itself slips away, now you are mine...Slowly the hours pass all through the night...Together we can disappear...for a while\\")  Getting a woman's attention has never been a problem for Mr. Dave Gahan.        Other songs from Hourglass include \\"Miracles,\\" a slow and sombre piece with Gahan reflecting on his beliefs, hopes and fears (\\"I want to accept the truth, I really do...I believe...I'm just afraid of losing you\\"), \\"A Little Lie,\\" which has a bit of an 80s electronic vibe to it, focusing on the passage of time and what really matters (\\"I walk alone, and you know I never felt at home...I'm so hard to please, and I have everything I need\\"), \\"21 Days,\\" which discusses fear and being controlled (\\"Building a tower of fear by the river...Building it up, build it up\\") and \\"Down,\\" which ends the album on a very dark note, settling for any kind of physical intimacy, no matter how meaningless (\\"Take my body and soul, I feel so old\\").        The Japanese CD edition of [[ASIN:B000V6S6V8 Hourglass]] also features a bonus eleventh track:  \\"Kingdom (Digitalism Remix)\\" This is a really great remix and one of the best official mixes of the song available.  It's pretty much everything you could hope to want in a remix dance track.  While it's a nice bonus, it's not integral to the rest of the album the way the b-side, \\"Free,\\" was to the Japan CD release of \\"[[ASIN:B000AU1NYW Playing the Angel]].\\" (I would have liked to have seen the b-sides: \\"Tomorrow\\" & \\"Love Will Leave\\" added instead) So if you can't get it for a decent price, grab the [[ASIN:B000WTNCNQ Kingdom-Pt. 2]] Single CD instead.  Or get your hands on the official Hourglass Remixes LP/CD release, if you can find it.        This is as close to how a dépêche mode album would sound without Martin Gore behind it.  The fact that Dave is also working here with unofficial DM members Christian Eigner (drums) and Andrew Philpott, who helped write and perform these songs with him, only solidifies this idea even more.  Hourglass proves once again that Mr. Gahan has the talent and capability to compose some very impressive music.  He has now raised the bar all by himself for the work ahead of him with Depeche Mode.        Hourglass - Gahan does it again.        Stay Devoted!      \\"When my life stopped, there were no white lights. I didn't see St Peter and the Pearly Gates. It was just darkness. But there was something overwhelmingly much bigger than me. It scared the @#$% out of me. There's a bigger picture. We're all just playing our parts.\\"  - D.Gahan
B000ZK4466|5.0|It seems as though whenever I mention TMV, people tend to say they loved Deloused, but nothing else. I wonder why people expect such an imaginative band to remain static and relevant at the same time. But I digress...<br /><br />Well, for those of you who fall into the aforementioned category, this might be the disc that turns it around for you. This disc has insane energy coursing through it, thanks in no small part to their new drummer, Thomas Pridgen. This album will leave you gasping for breath, but unfortunately, it does so with the stinker \\"Tourniquet Man\\". I can honestly say this is the only song of theirs that I will outright avoid. Despite this misstep, this album includes some of their best songs to date, such as \\"Goliath\\" (my personal fave), as well as \\"Agadez\\" and \\"Ilyena\\". There are some remaining elements of their previous works, but this is their best integration of what makes them work as a band. If their other albums have turned you away, this might bring you back into the fold to show you what you have been missing.
0393316041|5.0|One of the most entertaining biographies I have read to date. Richard P. Feynman is not your stereotypical lab-coat scientist; his relentless curiosity has led him down many adventurous paths and generated hundreds of humorous stories. Don't let the `theoretical physicist' subtitle distract you, this book is as much about the pursuit of science, as it is about the innate curiosity and passion about making the best of your life - through the eyes of Richard P. Feynman. This book is guaranteed to make you laugh. Enjoy it, and make sure to share it with your friends.
B00006F83Y|5.0|This album takes you on a drive through the desert rocking your f'ing socks off even though you are stuck in traffic. If you are new to QOTSA, start here. If you know them, then Satan will torture you for not owning this.
B0010YSD7M|3.0|Not as well written as the series. Seems the writers were too interested in wrapping things up and rushed through the story line. Certain scenes, though breath taking, where too long and seemed to be edited that way just to kill time.
B00000ILDF|3.0|This movie is clearly not the best of the Alien legacy, and is maybe the worst, knowing that we cannot really compare it with \\"Alien\\" that appeared about 10 years before. My preferred movies are clearly \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Alien - Resurrection\\". The screenplay of \\"Alien 3\\" is correct but is disappointing. Indeed, the beginning of \\"Aliens\\" is completely in adequacy with the end of \\"Alien\\" and the beginning of \\"Alien -Resurrection\\" is completely in adequacy with the end of \\"Alien 3\\". For \\"Aliens\\" and \\"Alien - Resurrection\\" the screenplay was constrained to respect some important facts from previous opuses (an unknown planet - with hundreds of eggs - to be explored, the death of Lt Ripley) but the scriptwriter had (in my opinion) much more freedom for \\"Alien 3\\", the only constraint being that Ripley had to be found in a spaceship with her misfortune comrades (see \\"Aliens\\"). So, I was waiting for something really new: the idea of the prison was not too bad but badly exploited in my sense. Something else that was weird: there were 2 parasites in the spaceship, one had impregnated Ripley and the other did nothing !? Was it waiting for the landing ? It should have tried to impregnate Newt or Hicks during their sleep. This is not explained in the movie, where only 1 egg is shown in the spaceship whereas there were 2 creatures ! Something is missing somewhere or I missed something.     Maybe I am a bit too critical, this is an interesting entertainment movie, at least to understand \\"Alien - Resurrection\\". However, I cannot give more than 3 stars to this movie since I think the movie could have been much better and somewhat vitiates the Alien legacy.
B000003TAW|5.0|This album is one of a few albums that holds the most memories of the best times in my life. I was usually having a lot of fun when I was listening to this album.
B000002KKS|5.0|Black Sabbath made a solid comeback after parting with Ozzy and just found a great replacement with Ronnie James Dio.  This is definitely Dio's best work of his career and certainly one of Sabbath's most memorable albums as well.  Anyone who loves metal has to own this album!    Every song on this album rocks!  'Neon Knights', 'Children Of The Sea', and 'Heaven And Hell' are probably the best ones but 'Die Young', 'Wishing Well' and 'Lonely Is The Word' are great too.  'Lady Evil' has a good grungy rythm. 'Walk Away' is probably the weakest song on this album but it's still good.    This is Dio at his best and one of Sabbath's all-time best albums.  This is basically one of the all-time best albums in metal history and is a must-have.
B00008WT5J|4.0|AC/DC's 1986 album, Who Made Who, would help pave the way toward their commercial comeback in the early `90s. Released as the soundtrack for the Stephen King movie, Maximum Overdrive, Who Made Who works well as an introduction to the band. The tracks \\"You Shook Me All Night Long\\", \\"Hells Bells\\", and \\"For Those About to Rock (We Salute You)\\" are three of the most enduring tracks, still receiving steady airplay on album oriented rock radio. The track \\"Ride On\\" was as close as the band got to a ballad and is very good as are \\"Sink the Pink\\" and \\"Shake Your Foundations\\", two of the three best songs from their uneven 1985 release, Fly on the Wall. The three \\"new\\" tracks include the title song, arguably their best single since 1981's \\"Let's Get It Up\\", and two instrumentals, one very good (\\"Chase the Ace\\") and one that is just okay (\\"D.T.\\"). All told, Who Made Who is a good purchase for an AC/DC fan since it has three of their best songs and a few great deep cuts that you'll never hear on the radio.
B0002XMF4Y|4.0|This album is good but pales in comparison with 'Heaven and Hell.'  Neither the music, lyrics, or recording quality is up to par with its predecessor.    It's still a good album with 'Turn Up the Night', 'Voodoo', and 'Mob Rules' probably being the best songs.  Yeah, 'Sign of the Southern Cross' is ok but sounds like an inferior version of 'Heaven and Hell' and there you have Dio's silly magic lyrics starting to slip in.  I like 'Falling off the Edge of the World' better.  'Country Girl', 'Slipping Away' are OK.  Like 'Sign...' with 'Heaven and Hell', 'Over and Over' sounds like an inferior copy of 'Lonely is the Word' from Heaven and Hell.    Dio sounds great as always but this album is just not as good compared to 'Heaven and Hell.' Nevertheless, it's still one of Sabbath's best albums.
B00003CXA2|5.0|Forrest Gump  DVD<br /><br />Tom Hanks stars in this movie about a young man who unwittingly participates in some of the key moments of the twentieth century.  I highly recommend this movie for fans of Tom Hanks and anyone alive in the twentieth century.<br /><br />Gunner  April, 2008
B0000071GA|5.0|Great album by this hard rock band from Switzerland that came along with other New Wave metal greats from Europe such as Def Leppard and Scorpions.    This album is pretty much good old hard rock in the style of Def Leppard's 'High and Dry.'  Every song on this album has good lyrics and music with decent vocals that resemble AC/DC's Bon Scott somewhat but a little more high pitched.  'Headhunter', 'Eat the Rich', 'Night Wolf', 'Ready to Burn', all have a good hard edge.  'Screaming in the Night' is one of the better power ballads from the early 80s too.      All in all, if you like AC/DC, early Def Leppard, or Scorpions, you will almost certainly love this album.
B000TGJ8CQ|5.0|Next  DVD<br /><br />Next starring Nicolas Cage is an action thriller about a magician who can see exactly two minutes into the future.  Julianne Moore plays an FBI agent who recruits him to help prevent a bombing by Terrorist.  Peter Faulk(aka Columbo) has a small part in the movie.  It's nice to see him still working.<br /><br />This movie has an underlying Science Fiction/ Fantasy theme, something that seems to be happening more and more these days.  I was surprised to find this.  I don't recall it being promoted at all.<br /><br />Highly recommended for fans of Nicolas Cage and Julianne Moore and Peter Faulk and Science Fiction/ Fantasy movies.<br /><br />Gunner April, 2008
B0001NBMEE|2.0|I have always been a sucker for a knight-in-shining armour movie, but with this film, even as a child, I had to draw the line.  Robert Wagner is a bad actor, always has been, always will be.  His Aleta, Janet Leigh is beautiful, graceful, and eager, but even she cannot arouse from our Sir Valiant more than his open-mouthed, handsome, vacant stare.  James Mason, the consumate actor, must have wondered what he had done to deserve working with such amateurs.  Still, as a child, I was enthralled and thrilled by the sets, costumes, and derring-go.  It was just the wooden young man as Valiant that set my teeth on edge.  I was much happier to curl on the couch and read  my grandfather's original news paper Sunday comics  collection of the Prince Valiant adventures, along with his passionate and adventurous family, instead!
1594489505|4.0|Great storytelling and an easy, enjoyable read.  The story flows from page one til the end, leaving you wanting even more.  While a little on the heavy side, a perfect escape novel!
0452289963|5.0|I can not read this book for you, or force you to read it.  This is a choice that you make. The only person i can help is myself, and the only person you can help is yourself.  One Love.
0307265730|5.0|Anyone who has been fortunate enough to read Jhumpa Lahiri's previous works like [[ASIN:0618101365 Interpreter of Maladies]] and [[ASIN:0618733965 The Namesake]] already know the lushness of her prose and the emotional depth of her characters when they read her latest collection of short stories. She again focuses on the intractable bridge between old and new cultures and generations in her piercing look at the lives of expatriate Bengalis and their first-generation American-born children. The precarious balance the younger generation discovers they need to maintain is more than recognizing the disparities between Asian and Western cultures. It becomes an introspective struggle between maintaining traditional values and assimilating into the meritocratic American system. Primarily in their thirties and often feeling adrift in this cross-generational quagmire, they are silently ambivalent about their parents, traversing between betrayal and awe in mercurial strokes.<br /><br />Each of the eight stories is meticulously crafted by Lahiri to amplify her unifying theme with a minimum of contrivance. The title story focuses on an aging widower's visit with his daughter Ruma's family in Seattle. He has felt inordinately liberated since his wife's death, and now Ruma wants him to live permanently with her family. They struggle to reach a level of intimacy they have never known before. A similar struggle can be found in \\"Only Goodness\\", in which a rehabilitated alcoholic attempts to return to his estranged family through his elder sister. Even relationships that seem established on the surface such as the cross-cultural marriage at the center of the subtle \\"A Choice of Accommodations\\" unravel in small details as they travel to the wedding of an old friend. A non-Indian perspective is also represented in \\"Nobody's Business\\" where a student named Paul gets involved in the personal affairs of his housemate Sangeeta. A surprising jewel of a tale, \\"Hell-Heaven\\" spells out a housewife's attraction toward a younger man in subtly engrossing terms.<br /><br />My favorite part of the book is the three-part story under the umbrella title of \\"Hema and Kaushik\\" that ends the collection because it best summarizes Lahiri's concept of assimilation, specifically coming to terms with a constant disorientation. The first story, \\"Once in a Lifetime\\", introduces us to the two characters as teens with Kaushik having just returned from India. The middle and best story, \\"Year's End\\", flashes forward with Kaushik having become a globetrotting photojournalist who comes to realize his unaccustomed earth is his own home in Massachusetts where his father's new family has effectively eradicated any trace of late mother's life. Lahiri poignantly shows how his journey is not about fitting in or settling down but embracing one's heritage to forge one's destiny in full. The final story is a bit anticlimactic with Hema and Kaushik meeting again in Italy. Regardless, the author is fully aware of how the world's irrationalities pose a constant challenge to her characters. She knows they remain true to themselves only by keeping vigil on their culture.ttraction toward a younger man in subtly engrossing terms.

B000OPOAM0|4.0|I've always enjoyed this movie. I won't bother reviewing the movie itself aside from the 4 stars I gave it since there are so many other reviews that already touched on what I would say.    Too bad the Lenticular Edition doesn't seem to exist anywhere, though. I ordered it twice from Amazon directly and both times received the original movie without the Lenticular Edition cover. I tried to return it both times and Amazon immediately credited my account without even providing me a return label (I asked for it twice, never received a response). Then I ordered it new from an Amazon marketplace seller, and got exactly the same DVD. On all three DVD's I received, the UPC bar code for the Lenticular Edition DVD is taped over the original printed UPC bar code on the original DVD case.
1881273156|5.0|So many marriages and relationships go bad, not for lack of love, shared interests or committment, but because we don't recognize our partner's efforts to show their love.  This book offers a practical approach to sustaining a long term relationship.  We bought copies for everyone we care about, and we keep hearing  \\"I wish I'd known this a long time ago!\\"
B0000029DD|2.0|To my ear, this is one of the most overrated albums I have heard. Not that it's bad. It's just all right. There is simply nothing here that merits the gushing accolades many of Buckley's fans heap upon it. Or maybe I just don't connect with it. After repeated listenings. If you can get your hands on a copy, you'd do well to listen to it before buying your own based on its hype. You may becomes as enamored as many others have. You find find it so-so as I do. Or you may even fall into the category with several people I know who find it to be unbearably boring.

0307346617|5.0|'World War Z...' was my first zombie book and, to my surprise, I enjoyed it very much.  Rather than one singular story it is a collection of many interviews chronicling mankind's war with the zombies and the successful aftermath.  What are zombies?  Think of the \\"Dawn of the Dead\\" film series or \\"I Am Legend\\" and you have the idea.  The dead become re-animated and feed on live human flesh.  The author does a wonderful job of making the war, complete with all the carnage and ugliness, very believable (...sort of).  Gruesome at times, 'World War Z...' is never a boring read.      Bottom line: who would have thought a book on zombies could be so good??  Strongly recommended.
B0010X745K|4.0|I thought this was a very good movie. I enjoyed the plot, the development of some characters, and the special effects. Overall, the acting was very good, too. Now, can some one please tell me the point in ending the film that way? Usually in movies of this type, you are left with the feeling of hope. You come away with the notion that, yes things are bleak, but the human spirit and desire to live will overcome. But this is a horrible way to end! What is the point?

The weight is so much better than the Sixaxis Controller, I feel like im holding a real controller not a lite weight piece of junk. As for the Rumble Feature.... it's Perfect! It Added so much more of a connection to the game when I was playing Warhawk today, feeling the recoil of the weapons really gave me a rush and also let me know what I was missing without the Rumble Feature. In Short don't waste time, go drop the $55.00 and get what you should of when you first purchased your PS3!
B000ZN802W|5.0|This may be one of the best films that I have seen in the last few years, and Sean Penn may well have directed his masterpiece in this incredibly moving and powerful true story of a young man who seeks him Self in an epic journey.<br /><br />Chris McCandless is a young man who has just graduated from college.  He has nearly $25,000 in savings.  His family is hoping he will use it toward a Harvard education.  Instead, he does the unthinkable: he gives all but a few hundred to charity, sets off on a trek around the country and eventually burns the last bit of money that he has left.  Crazy?  Perhaps...to us, anyway.<br /><br />\\"Life begins OUTSIDE of your comfort zone\\" --Conversations With God. This quote applies to Chris because he's chosen not play life \\"safe.\\" He wants to live, and to engage in new experiences often means taking risks. From the start of his journey, Chris does this nearly every day.<br /><br />The journey of Chris \\"Alexander Supertramp\\" McCandless is one of the most powerful journeys of man: it is the journey of letting go.  He decides to return to a state of simplicity by removing virtually all of his worldly possessions and attachments, except for the basic necessities.  He does not wish to be bogged down by conformity and the hypocrisy of human relationships any longer, and so he leaves his family and everything he knows behind.<br /><br />The irony of letting go is that it is tantamount with healing and with Self discovery.  Chris meets a number of people throughout his journey.  They all seem to be touched by this simple and yet wise young man who brings with him a powerful, healing energy whether those he interacts with are aware of it or not.<br /><br />Perhaps the most touching meeting of all, is the last one shown with Ron Franz (Hal Holbrook in an especially sweet performance) as an old man living in the Anza-Borrego desert of Southern California.  Chris challenges Ron to not give up on life and new experiences just because he's old, and to not give in to the illusion that human relationships are the principle form of happiness.  We see the sparkle of realization in Ron's eyes as the truth sinks in.  Ron is so taken with Chris that he wants to adopt him.  Chris simply tells him that they can talk about it when he returns from Alaska.  It's at this point that Ron realizes that Chris belongs to no one except himself even though he knows that Chris, indeed, loves him.  Chris knows that a truly loving relationship is about letting go, not holding on, and it's evident that this is the only type of relationship that he has with each and every person he meets and comes across.<br /><br />Chris is like a modern day Thoreau (which ironically he read a lot of including Tolstoy, London, and other writers).  He goes into the wilds of Alaska to live deliberately and simply in order to gain further insight and wisdom as to who he is and what life is really all about.  It is no surprise that when he finally passes away, it is with a smile on his face because he knows that he has truly lived.<br /><br />The performance of Emile Hirsch is a fantastic one.  He plays the role simply, much like how the real Chris McCandless must have been.  It's as if he understands what it must have been like to know Chris and he incorporates that knowledge into the role.<br /><br />Jena Malone (as Chris's sister) is equally important as she narrates and chronicles the life of her brother.  She seems to be the only one who truly understood him and why he did what he did, regardless of the fact that she had to heal herself from the loss of her brother.<br /><br />Chris died at the age of 23, and yet I would submit that most people have not lived the happy life that he lived at twice his age.  He truly lived the life he wanted to have.<br /><br />One thing that I found most profound was even though he was helping many people whom he came across on his journey, Chris was always provided for whether it be a pair of boots, a beat up cowboyhat, or some old fishing gear and machete.  Is this not what all of the sacred writings talk about?<br /><br />This is an experience to be treasured, and this film should be required viewing for nearly everyone.  Because through Chris's journey, we might stop and reflect on our own journeys.  Are we living our lives to the fullest?  Are we happening to life or is life happening to us?  Are we happy?  Chris found his answers, and hopefully, we will all find ours since we are all on our own spiritual journey.of the sacred writings talk about?

B000OVLBEO|4.0|This movie was camp even by comic book standards,<br />and some of the dialog was awful and I loved every<br />second of it.<br /><br />Perhaps I liked it because I had no expectations,<br />not having read the comic.<br /><br />I am unaware of films when they are released,<br />learning of them later when I come across them<br />on DVD, in this case at my local library.<br /><br />The plot is great.<br />How could you not like it.<br />Man sells soul and services to devil for favors.<br />Devil collects by turning him into a ghost rider,<br />a monstrous flaming skeleton bounty hunter for souls<br />on a flaming chopped Harley from Hell.<br /><br />Yeah, I think I'll check this one out.<br /><br />I watched it, I loved it, I immediately put it<br />on my Amazon wish list.<br /><br />One huge problem I have with this and many other<br />movies is the complete ignorance of the<br />philosophical and theological foundations of<br />the plot for their films. This film uses the<br />Christian world-view as the foundation for its<br />plot. Why not represent it somewhat accurately.<br /><br />The devil's \\"son\\": \\"I don't have a soul\\"<br />Who came up with that?!<br />The devil is an angel. An angel has a soul.<br />How does an angel have a son?<br />They don't reproduce?<br />If one did,<br />the offspring would certainly have a soul.<br /><br />I know that the story is utterly fantastic,<br />so perhaps I am being too fussy.<br /><br />Why does the elder Ghost Rider<br />ride with the younger<br />only to bail out before the conflict?<br />Perhaps because it's really cool (hot?),<br />which it most definitely is.<br /><br />This meeting of the Monster, Comic, Camp, Biker,<br />Supernatural, Western and Love story<br />is guaranteed mindless entertainment.

B000IOM1YG|5.0|My favorite Alan Parsons Project recording.  It is in my top 10 recordings for all artists.  This release has a feeling of mystery or a theme of a mission.  Recorded at the famous Abbey Road Studios in London between September 1977 and February 1978.  The theme is based on the book, Pyramid Power, by G. Patrick Flanagan, released in 1973.  My favorite songs are One More River, Can't Take It With You, and The Eagle Will Rise Again.  Remastered with bonus material - the bonus material is fair - mainly instrumentals, demos, and backing tracks.
B0002IQNAG|5.0|Wow, I enjoyed \\"Night of the Living Dead\\", but this has got to be the best zombie movie ever (unless you count \\"Planet Terror\\"...) and I have watched this movie over and over and over...The best thing: THIS VERSION COMES WITH THE FIRST ISSUE OF THE COMIC, 3 VERSIONS OF THE FILM, AND A WHOLE UNDEAD MORE!!! This is a must-see if you are a horror fan of any type.
0393324818|4.0|I agree with the reviewer who said this is a good baseball book for the casual baseball fan.  This book gives the best, least complicated explanation of sabermetrics that I've read.  I take this book with me on plane rides, because I find the first two-thirds engaging and relaxing.  (The last third fawns over Beane and his team of undervalued players -- the part about how Ken Williams is hesitant to take Billy Beane's phone calls, for fear of what sneaky trade the wily Billy Beane is going to trick Williams into taking -- a bit annoying, especially to a Sox fan, so I never read that part.)

I loved the way the hero treated our heroine, especially when they were eloping, and later on, even though i hated him a little bit for being so conceited, he turned out so sweet and caring, *sigh*. Cute enough book!!!!
B000ZN8036|5.0|All I can say is wow!     Christopher seemed to be looking for a meaning to his life. He might have found what he was looking for. At the end of Christophers life, Christopher found that true happiness needs to be shared. Shared with others as love is to be shared. It was to late for him as the story goes he was trapped by the very thing that gave him his insight. He was lost. In the wilderness. Even though the wilderness took him. It seems he may have found what he was searching for. How many of us are lost in the wilderness? How many of us are searching for meaning? Will any of us find it before the wilderness takes us too?

I cried in various parts of the story, since i felt very connected with the characters, and such is Mrs. Quinn's writing talents. I just thought Collin would be a little more playful and less serious, but nonetheless, it was beautiful.

I have seen citizen kane, raging bull, psycho, every one of Kubrick's films, 7 samurai among many of Kurosawa's films, to make to a long story short from someone who has seen a great number of movies, there has never been a movie that has moved me like Schindler's List. It is a cinematic MASTERPIECE, and has literally changed me. This is a film every human being on the planet must see.
B000VNMMQG|5.0|Must read, and must see. I really really recommend this book and DVD for those who are in pursuit of reforming our political and governmental systems to make better society. Two words come to my mind: Justice and Freedom. Especially, this book and DVD are highly recommendable to all Christians because William Wiberforce followed what Jesus did for us by saving us from our sins. What Jesus did for Righteousness & Salvation is comparable to what the actor did for Justice & Freedom. Amazing grace ~~~~~

Instead this album has a 70's psycho-funk appeal to it throughout with only a hint of her usual neo-soul which can be found on telephone...  At first I didn't like this album but it grew on me as Erykah is only spreading her horizon and obviously doesn't want to limit herself to other peoples interpretation of what her sounds standard should be, as this time around I can hear some Minnie Riperton influence in some of her sound arrangements...  So listen with a open mind and this album may grow on you... Stand out songs are \\"me, cell, honey, telephone, and twinkle...
B000YD7S26|5.0|This is simply a great DVD - for anyone interested in the music of Anton Bruckner, in the conducting of Herbert von Karajan, and most especially, for anyone interested in the Austrian-German performing tradition in the 20th century.<br /><br />Taped (not filmed) in front of audiences in 1979 at the Stiftskirche St. Florian, Linz (Symphony No. 8) and 1978 at the Musikverein in Vienna (Symphony No. 9 and the Te Deum), the performances have the visual patina of European television of that era, transporting the viewer back to a particular place and time, especially for anyone who was alive then and remembers it.  (By contrast, Deutsche Gramophon's DVDs of the Mahler symphonies, performed much earlier in the 1970s by Leonard Bernstein and the Vienna Philharmonic, have a cleaner look for having been recorded on film, which was restored for the DVD release.)  The sound, however, far from being congested TV audio, is exceptionally spacious and clear, and for the most part, well-defined across the spectrum.  And it's enhanced by being able to see one of the world's greatest orchestras execute these richly-textured scores.  As of my second viewing I couldn't decide whether it was actually that more acoustic information and detail was available here than in the typical audio-only recording, or if it just seemed that way.<br /><br />The performance itself is of a kind that cannot be experienced anywhere today.  Perfectly controlled and beautifully nuanced, Karajan maintains the famous \\"line\\" through the massive structure of the symphonies and the compact, burnished architecture of the Te Deum while wringing astonishing power and intensity from the last works of a composer - and from an orchestra - known for both.  Missing are the coldness and detachment sometimes ascribed to Karajan's music-making by his detractors - not that any review or performance, however remarkable, would persuade them.  Instead what's evident is full, unrestrained commitment from a master then in his last years at the height of his powers, standing in front of an orchestra with whom he had spent decades moving deeper into music that plumbs the depths of human experience.  Even the legendarily controlled playing of the Vienna Philharmonic here feels so unconstrained that inevitably just a few rough, humanizing edges appear in an otherwise seamless fabric.<br /><br />Electrifying and unforgettable, I'll be returning to these discs often, and I can't thank DG enough for making them available.eight of his powers, standing in front of an orchestra with whom he had spent decades moving deeper into music that plumbs the depths of human experience.

0307237702|1.0|If you want to learn how to write good political propaganda, take a look at this book to see how it should be done. This is a masterful propaganda piece.    If you want to find out more about who Barack Obama is, read the Barack Obama book \\"Dreams from My Father\\" instead.    I am rating this down because I wanted to find out more about who this guy is and I got something totally different. What a waste of time.    If you want to learn about Obama's thoughts on popular political issues and see how he spins his position in order to pander to the masses and attempt to win their vote, read this book instead of the \\"Dreams from My Father\\" book.    To his credit, whether or not you agree with his positions, the book is well written and Obama demonstrates a good understanding of the background of the issues he discusses.    However, many of the \\"solutions\\" to the social issues he discusses are completely unworkable and unrealistic from a financial/economic perspective.    I assume that he is not so stupid that he believes all of the things that he proposes and that he is merely presenting an idealistic message that he hopes the masses will eat up and that will get him elected.
B000WQ9UA8|1.0|When I heard all the glowing reviews over this album I thought \\"Gee, maybe she finally released a good album\\" and then I got online and listened to it and all I can say is: what album were you people listening to? All the songs sound the same and it's all generic dance music that any other artist could have put out to stay relevant and that's what she did. \\"Piece of me\\" is supposed to be her middle finger to the media...but she didn't write it. Some other people wrote it! Why is it so hard for her to create music, isn't she supposed to be an artist? \\"Gimme more\\" is probably the best song on the album. Other than that one, the rest of it is all generic. Her voice sounds digitally enhanced as usual and she takes a back seat to excellent production. Instead of rehearsing new dance steps, why doesn't she go get singing lessons to improve the quality of her voice? Cause it's gotten crappier over the years. I will never understand the hype over her, what made her famous were image makers, excellent producers and her ability to roll around half-naked in videos and on stage, cause as an actual musical artist she has no talent! She's no Madonna or Janet. Those two woman actually had control over their images and had creative imput in their music despite the fact they didn't have phenomenal vocals.

0195170776|3.0|CONSIDERATION: go to the Library or bookstore and compare before buying.<br /><br />I was so eager to get a copy of the NOAD, based on one of the reviews in particular and on the generally excellent reviews, that I spent extra money to speed delivery (for a dictionary!).<br /><br />I'm sadly disappointed.<br /><br />I had hoped NOAD would top my old American Heritage Dictionary (AHD). I have loved the AHD for years but hoped to get even more etymologies from the NOAD. That was my main interest - to have the ultimate source for word origins in a reasonable tome, that is in a single manageable volume.<br /><br />The NOAD has several flaws, by my lights:<br /><br />1 - the etymologies are way too HARD to locate! you have to search carefully to find these. WHY??? They are too subtly denoted. ... the AHD etymologies are immediately locatable and pop out nicely without contrasting or competing with the main text. Also, judging from a few I've searched for, the AHD does a better job of summarizing the etymologies, making them more succinct and readable.<br /><br />2 - unexpectedly, I find the too-white paper of the NOAD to be STARK (as in eye-straining) and too contrasty with the cheap-looking print. The over-white paper makes the graphics look cheaper. Also, I don't like the pictures being interspersed with the body of the dictionary; they break up the text in a cluttery way.  ... the AHD has a pleasing off-white paper and the text is totally readable and comfortable on the eyes and the numerous graphics are neatly off to the side in a half column on each page.<br /><br />I was surprised that the NOAD is not an inviting book to look at, as is the AHD. It's a subtle difference, but I definitely prefer the AHD (old one I have, anyway).<br /><br />Perhaps I should have trusted my reaction to the NOAD cover: I was put off by the cold blue cover (red-white-blue motif, mostly blue) design. I had a suspicion that it foretold problems. I was right. But that's just my taste, maybe. I think not; but, I know tastes do vary.<br /><br />I have only perused the NOAD for a half hour. Maybe I'll reassess my views later. But I doubt it.<br /><br />If I put the AHD next to the NOAD, I am slightly repulsed by the NOAD and definitely attracted to the AHD, even with the cover removed. The NOAD coverless book is almost black.<br /><br />A side note: the NOAD has no word roots in the back. Maybe that is way too esoteric for most users. But I kind of liked having those ancient roots available despite almost never using them. They gave the AHD an aura of depth and seriousness which, combined with the inviting and comfortably presented definitions made for a satisfying whole. Actually, they could have left the root section out; but somehow it was nice to know it was there just to remind me that language is sooooo ancient. The NOAD not having such diminishes it in my opinion.used the NOAD for a half hour. Maybe I'll reassess my views later. But I doubt it.

The DVD played superbly and the sound and picture were all great also came with some very interesting and informative special features!

His ideas are refreshing and I believe he has a keen sense about about our world and how people relate to one another. The added bonus was that Barack was the narrator.  I thoroughly enjoyed it and am looking forward to reading Dreams from My Father.
B000050FEN|5.0|When I bought this DVD, I thought it was going to be scary. I thought I wouldn't be able to sleep after seeing it. It wasn't scary but it did make me lose sleep. I was on the edge of my seat the entire time I was watching this and the ending was completely unexpected. I highly recommend this to everyone who loves a good thriller.
6303921248|5.0|This BBC/A&E production is the finest adaptation that I have ever seen of a Jane Austen novel. It is simply magnificent- from its capturing of Austen's razor-sharp wit, to the beautiful cinematography and engaging music, to the fast-moving plot that sweeps its audience in and won't let us go. My first viewing of this miniseries was back during its initial American broadcast on A&E in about '96. That was my introduction to the magical world of Jane Austen (in my early teens), and it was because of this series that I was inspired to read the novel itself for the first time, as well as to discover other Austen books/film adaptations.    The casting was one of its greatest strengths. Jennifer Ehle, as Elizabeth, was lovely and had just the right humor and charisma to carry the film on her shoulders. Colin Firth was outstanding as Mr. Darcy; the incredible depth of emotion he brought to his performance(held just under the surface by Darcy's reserved exterior) was a huge part of my being so deeply moved, romantically, by this film. (I fall in love with Mr. Darcy every time I watch it, and I'm really NOT one of those girls who tends to swoon over romantic movies. I certainly do in this case!) The entire cast was excellent.    It seems that when films are adapted from novels, they're often able to do one of two things well: they either capture the spirit of the book to make for a good movie (while unfortunately leaving out or changing many of the details of the book), OR they follow the book very closely, but as a result come across as somewhat stiff and dull on screen. This film is so brilliant because it manages to achieve both ideals: It is painstakingly faithful to the novel (almost word-for-word in most scenes), while also being as fast-paced and full-of-life as any feature film could ever be. I'm so happy that the creative team allotted nearly 6 hours to tell the whole story, so that it would never feel rushed. It may, in fact, be the most faithful adaptation I've ever seen in capturing the plot, dialogue, and spirit, of any novel.

0385522401|5.0|I am really suprised by the number of reviewers who didn't like this book. I don't quite understand why. Maybe it hit the nerve somewhere?    Some were annoyed by the lack of communication between the couple - but hey, that was the point!!! Otherwise there would be no novel, would there? The feelings they both have are so amazingly realistic, I couldn't put it down. It made me ''nauseus'' (this is for the people who complained about the repetition of this word in the novel). I could totally relate.    For those who complain about the author ignoring the female character - not true! - I rememebr clearly that as I was reading it I was thinking ''how can he know that!''    Better than Saturday, even better than the Cement Garden. A wonderful topic, by a wonderful writer!

0140449337|5.0|Marcus Aurelius was an emperor of Rome, but this is not what he is remembered for.  What really draws us to him is the set of journals which he kept for himself--books which he wrote purely for himself, but which speak to millions even today.  These books contained words of wisdom--words that kept him strong in times of stress and danger.  One of the primary messages that runs through the book is the idea that all that occurs in life is nothing new.  There are many things beyond our control which may cause us stress.  However, he puts forth the idea that what causes the stress is not the things that happen to us, but the way in which we react.  Instead of complaining about the things we cannot change, we should change how we react to the things that happen to us.  In other words, change yourself before you try to change the world.  You'll find it to be much more achievable.    I really recommend this book for everyone.  In particular, if you are going through any stress in your life, this would provide some support in helping you through tough times.  A must-have for every library.
B00005JLD4|5.0|This film is definitely a must see - one of the very best films I've ever seen.  Beautiful, haunting - you won't forget this one.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|Two viewings and I love this resolution of the Ori story arc. Everyone seemed to be having so much fun in the making of this film. I could have done with out the vulgar cursing, but it is more true to the reality of the character(s) who go there.<br /><br />There are two more in the works. Based on this, I will definitely be buying them if the quality retention remains... and I'm sure it will.
B000X1Z0BU|5.0|With its journalistic filming and the amazing songwriting of Dan, this is by far the best movie we've seen in awhile.  Not only did I watch it twice yesterday, but I just now purchased the soundtrack and the roads outgrown.<br />I actually cried at certain times in the movie, the songs were so lovely.
0316548189|5.0|This book recounts the life of Nelson Mandela beginning in childhood up to the present age.  It is written by Mandela himself - it's honest, straightforward style seems to be an honest attempt by Mandela to portray himself objectively, avoiding the tendency to be self-serving.      A fascinating book.  It begins with Mandela in his young childhood living in a pre-industrial society of native Africans in the countryside of South Africa where white settlers have dominated industrialized society.  It is an engaging society, - perhaps more advanced than our own - as one must reconsider what it means to live in harmony and in cooperation;  A true democracy, based on the ideals that all are equal.     Mandela undergoes culture shock when he runs away from his traditional homeland to seek his fortunes in the big city of Johannesberg.  Here is encounters white society up close, and is mortified at the inequity that exists between the native blacks, and the immigrant whites that make every attempt to dominate their country and exploit its indigenous peoples.      Mandela encounters a small group of educated, free-thinking educated blacks, and joins the African National Congress.  Here he encounters several other oppressed peoples: Indians, Communists, and liberal whites.   He slowly makes his life's objective to be a freedom fighter. A fighter for civil rights for all people.   A life of struggle, where one must be willing to pay the ultimate price.  And he nearly does.    He becomes the inspiration for downtrodden average black citizen, nearly enslaved within their own country. He willingly faces grave danger, is tried several times for his political ideals, denounced as \\"treason\\" and is eventually sent to prison \\"for life.\\"      Mandela's life in prison is austere.  But he and his colleagues never yield in their commitment to freedom for all South Africans.  His wife, Winnie is an example of true dedication - equally a woman of integrity and worthy of the highest praise.She undergoes severe hardships being married to a \\"freedom fighter.\\"      Mandela avoids the tendency to give up in the face of severe conditions, showing true mettle as he remains dedicated to the rights for all people to live free in racist South Africa.  27 years later having risked his life and surviving harsh prison conditions, he emerges a national hero.     A must read for anyone - Mandela is history in the making.
0670858048|5.0|My daughter, aged 4, was a little bit confused at the book when it first arrived.  She didn't like that it didn't have words.

B0000549B0|5.0|I have watched this movie a million times over the years and it is never any less endearing then the first time I saw it.  Jimmy Stewart as at his finest in this movie.  He originated the role on the stage and there could never have been a better actor for this role.  If you like Jimmy Stewart, or simply miss the good old days of film, this is a must-have for your collection.

0618918248|2.0|My question for Dawkins and others who argue that there is \\"no evidence\\" for God is: What evidence would you accept?  I don't think a few \\"miracles\\" would do it. ( A voice from the clouds? Better consult my neurologist or psychiatrist.)  I can't think of anything that could change Dawkins' mind short of a complete disruption of science.  But then, the anthropic principle would imply that we wouldn't be here anyway.      A case in point is \\"The great prayer experiment,\\" which yielded a null result.  (I agree that the experiment is foolish.)  Dawkins notes that believers responded that God chose not to participate.  (Presumably, any scientists involved are moving on to more interesting studies.)  Dawkins then says, \\"It could have yielded a positive result. And if it had, could you imagine that a single religious apologist would have dismissed it on the grounds that scientific research has no bearing on religious matters? Of course not.\\"  This is most likely true.     But he does not discuss the response of the scientist.  Let me use the same language:  It could have yielded a positive result. (Does Dawkins really mean this?) Can you imagine that a single scientist would accept this as evidence for God?  Of course not.  A scientist would say this is some physical phenomenon hitherto undetected.  First, we will make sure the result is valid and reproducible.  Then, we will investigate to see what it could be.  What is its range? Can it be shielded by material substances? Etc. etc.  Something like this has happened in cosmology.  The expansion of the universe is unexpectedly accelerating.  Is God pushing the galaxies apart?  No, there is postulated to be some dark energy in the universe.     So, the issue inevitably remains unresolved, which makes me believe the existence of God question lies outside the realm of science.  Those who think otherwise are committed to scientism, i.e., the \\"faith\\" that the physical universe is all there is.  I don't object to this, only to the extreme hostility and scorn Dawkins shows for any other mode of thinking.       Finally, Dawkins includes all religion, even the most moderate or progressive, in his opprobrium, arguing that it sets the stage that allows for extremism.  In my reading he does not document this assertion, for all his examples of horror stories are extreme.  Would he  rip Amish children out of their loving families just as Pius IX did with Edgardo Mortara?
0425220931|5.0|Before you read this book, open your mind to the possibility that the universe may be very different from your version of reality.  This is not a book about music theory or how to play the bass.  It is a wonderful and playful revelation about the relationship between Music and your life.  Both will change for the better if you are willing to leave behind what you already think you know.    Victor weaves an unbelievably believable tale which unites ideas about space, time, numbers, and nature into a new view of Music as a living, breathing being.  Fans of Richard Bach and Tom Brown, Jr., will enjoy this new perspective on their work.    Frankly, music players who are uncomfortable away from the written page of music will be uncomfortable with this book.  Improvisors of all kinds will know you have come home.
B0006VYG62|5.0|Like another reviewer stated, I also took this book at face value and thoroughly enjoyed it. Esther Greenwood fascinated me with the way her thinking and actions gradually became more and more bizarre. It sort of sneaks up on the reader.--Let's put it this way, I read it in 3 days which for me lately, means it was a page turner.  Looking for a good read--this is a good bet.
B000005RS6|5.0|Awesome live show. The sound is clear and loud, and the band are playing great. Nice to see the band still keeping on, and they've really trimmed alot of the excess noodling and extended solos from earlier incarnations to now just rocking and jamming away. The addition of Steve Morse in 1994 really shows how refreshed these aging rockers look and play.  There are alot of selections from their new album at the time, Purpendicular, along side a slew of classic rock chestnuts.  Steve Morse plays the older material gracefully and is playing has invigorated the rest of the band.  5 stars.

0375703861|3.0|I almost dropped this book half way through, but forced myself to go on and found that the second half was much better. It is at times engaging and witty, but at other times difficult to follow and even depressing in the description of some of the shabby lives of these people. I did not like the ending. So I enjoyed bits and pieces of it and suffered though the rest. Overall an OK book.

B0015HS5TA|4.0|I won't reinvent the wheel here by outlining the plot, the summary up above does that quite well.  All I will say that this is not a movie that will change the world, however it is a fun, light cute farse that will make you laugh several times while you are in the theater.  Sometimes that is enough.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Daniel Day Lewis' performance was fantastic, and the movie had the potential to be a great epic, but I don't think it got there. There are obviously many who loved it and will pan my review, but the movie never quite grabbed me like I thought it would.     At times it seemed to be building up to something, then it would fade away. I realize the movie had alot of ground (and time) to cover so there was not alot of time to dwell on one episode of his life, but I think it probably should have tried a little harder.     Don't get me wrong...the movie was good. It just wasn't as good as the hype suggested.    And the ending............? Huh?
B00009W0WM|5.0|... In America, they'd bring only a penny.<br /><br />I can only put it like this:<br /><br />The Good:<br /><br />1. The quality of the film transfer on this edition is excellent and a real pleasure to watch. The shadows, shading and the attention to detail of the enhancement from the previous versions, is stunning.<br /><br />2. This movie has more memorable scenes than probably your own wedding ceremony. Also, this is probably the most quotable movie ever made and one of the greatest.<br /><br />3. The sound is pretty even throughout, there's no drop-out's or places where it comes across to thin.<br /><br />4. The extras on disc 2 are interesting and enough to give first-time viewers a better understanding.<br /><br />5. A really fantastic film for any age, first-timers or repeat offenders. I watch this movie every Sunday, and have done so for about the last 10 years. We look forward to it over here and never tire of it.<br /><br />6. Humphrey Bogart is absolutely magnificent and unforgettable as Richard 'Rick' Blaine, but Claude Rains does have all the best lines.<br /><br />The Bad:<br /><br />1. Roger Ebert's commentary on this is dry, dull and sounds as if he's reading from an essay, rather than speaking about the film candidly as it progresses. I can read this same information on the internet or in a multitude of books, with greater insight. I would've preferred a commentary track from Lauren Bacall over this anytime.<br /><br />2. This sound is only offered in PCM 2.0 and could've been presented in Dolby Digital 5.1 had they wished to invest the time and money. Maybe they will remaster it on the Blu-Ray version when it's released.<br /><br />3. Ingrid Bergman's line \\"Captain, the boy who is playing the piano, somewhere I have seen him ...\\" still bothers a lot of people, and even driven some away, which is too bad. It's a shame that during a period of great inhumanity, a little more humanity couldn't have been more equally distributed. Ingrid Bergman should've have been more aware ... but who's to say?
B000VKJ6VS|5.0|I am a self-admitted Creed fan, so the first Alterbridge album appealed to me bigtime.  I loved the anthems, like \\"Down to My Last\\" and I loved Myles Kennedy's voice!  When I saw them live the first time, they only had the one CD out, had said they would not play any Creed, so I was pretty much guaranteed to hear every song from One Day Remains, which I did.  They showed so much more talent together than was demonstrated on their debut CD, as much as I loved it.<br />What I hear on this one is the breaking away from Creed, Myles taking a bigger part in the songwriting, as well as guitar playing, as I understand it, and Tremonti is at the top of his game!<br />So here you have a completely new sound, still rockin, still awesome, vocals with range and emotion that makes your hair stand on end!  I think we have finally been shown what these four guys were meant to do together.<br />BTW, I did see them play live on this tour, if you can ever catch them- DO IT!!
B0013BNY2Q|4.0|R.E.M. is my second favorite band behind Pearl Jam, just like Neil Young is the godfather of grunge, R.E.M. are the godfathers of indie-rock. My favorite R.E.M. albums are Murmur, Automatic for the People and New Adventures in Hi-Fi. Needless to say I like R.E.M. in ballad mode and not in fast, rock mode. These guys are in their element when Stipe is singing heartfelt ballads. They are out of place when they go all out rock (example: Monster) This record is the latter. Good news though it is their most consistently good record since New Adventures in Hi-Fi. The first half of the album is flawless, however it drags until the last two songs Horse to Water and I'm Gonna Dj. Buy the extended version on mp3 downloads were you get two solid B-sides and some awesome live tracks.

B00127RAJY|5.0|I'm a full-time working mother of a toddler, and I don't have more than 30 minutes a day to work out since I have to work out in the morning before she's awake.  I've been searching for a video that could get the job done in 30 minutes or less, and this is that video.  I get just as much or more out of this video as I do in other videos that are 45 minutes to an hour.  There are 3 different levels: intermediate, intermediate/advanced, and advanced.  Each level has three circuits consisting of 3 minutes of strength training, 2 minutes of cardio, and 1 minute of abs.  I like how the different intervals keep you moving and your heart rate up.  I'm a Biggest Loser fan and have worked out to other videos of Jillian.  She can be very tough and agressive.  In this video, she's a lot more calm and right to the point in her instruction.  A nice feature on this DVD is when you get more advanced and learn the routine, you can play the workout with music only and no instruction.  Other posts have questioned whether you're to do it every day.  The recommendation at the beginning of the DVD is to do it every day; however, it's less than 30 minutes, so it shouldn't be that hard to squeeze it in each day.
B00004W199|5.0|Get ready, `cause this is gonna get complicated (real fast, lol).<br /><br />Okay, so you have both Criterion and Image Entertainment releasing the same movie in the same year; a film that until then, had only known cruddy, \\"Public Domain\\", hell (on TV, $0.99 VHS and $1.99 DVD's) and with pretty much the same remastered picture quality, right?<br /><br />Well here's where it gets very odd; the, Criterion set, has two versions of the film, a 78 minute theatrical version and an 83 minute Director's Cut, where as the Image Entertainment DVD has a running time of 82 minutes (note: all of the actual discs, corroborate, the DVD cases, printed running times).<br /><br />So, one would assume that the Image disc, was culled from the same print used to create the Criterion, Director's Cut, seeing as the run times are so close, and as previously mentioned, the prints look very much the same...<br /><br />...but you would be wrong.<br /><br />The reason being, is that both of the Criterion versions have a scene near the beginning of the film where a police/detective, person, is interviewing the driver of the second car in the opening drag race, asking the driver his version of the events on the bridge, but this scene is absent from the Image version.<br /><br />Now granted, this is a little 10 second scene, but it dose rise the question as to where Image got this pristine print from (as there are no restoration notes on the Image packaging) and why does it very from the theatrical version in this one scene (possibly others as well, but I've yet to do any serious, frame-by-frame, comparisons to all three films because, well, I do have a life, lol).<br /><br />The scene in question is actually quite redundant, as we already have witnessed the events on the bridge, and know what happened, and it's non-inclusion in the Image version is seamlessly done, making it look, for all the world, like the scene was an added scene for the Director's Cut of the, Criterion version, but since this scene is also in the theatrical cut, one has to wonder (once again) where the Image print came from (and how much more is different between the three versions, for that matter).<br /><br />Then there's the running time issues, as you would assume that the Image DVD would be the theatrical cut (possibly licensed from Criterion to provide a cheap alternative to the Criterion set, as was done with the movie, Zombi, which both Blue Underground and Shriek Show paid to have the film restored, and one put out a low priced, movie only DVD at the same time that the other put out a two disc special edition version) but where as the theatrical cut is 78 minutes, and it's Director's Cut is 83 minutes, the Image disc is 82 minutes (and is missing at least one scene that both the theatrical and Director's Cuts have).<br /><br />This is curious, and just thought that fans might want to know, or might even have some ideas, as to the nature of the Image DVD.r (once again) where the Image print came from (and how much more is different between the three versions, for that matter).    Then there's the running time issues, as you would assume that the Image DVD would be the theatrical cut (possibly licensed from Criterion to provide a cheap alternative to the Criterion set, as was done with the movie, Zombi, which both Blue Underground and Shriek Show paid to have the film restored, and one put out a low priced, movie only DVD at the same time that the other put out a two disc special edition version) but where as the theatrical cut is 78 minutes, and it's Director's Cut is 83 minutes, the Image disc is 82 minutes (and is missing at least one scene that both the theatrical and Director's Cuts have).

0452289963|5.0|Read this.  It has helped me to create some peace in my life.  It is very simple.  It takes a different perspective and a willingness to try something new.  He gives you simple exercises to be present in the moment.  I am someone who has anxiety because I over-think things.  His theory is that the majority of people's daily thoughts are on low-level unproductive thinking that is unnecessary and causes undue stress.  His recommendation is not to stop productive thinking, but stop the mindless chatter that takes away so much energy and leaves you enervated and confused.

B0011NVC9I|3.0|I was extremely excited when I heard Beowulf was going to make it to the big screen.  There had been so many failed attempts to do this epic poem justice.  There was Beowulf starring Christopher Lambert in 1999 and Beowulf and Grendel Starring Gerard Butler in 2005.  Both films had such promise, but I was ultimately disappointed with the changes made to the perfectly entertaining epic poem of Beowulf which in my opinion was brooding and mysterious.  Finally we come to the Robert Zemeckis film of Beowulf.  It was entertaining in it's own way, but ultimately fell short of what it could have been.  Don't get me wrong I enjoyed this film to a degree, but it wasn't as entertaining as reading Beowulf the epic poem.  Zemeckis has given us so many great films, but I believe he dropped the ball on this one.  If you like fantasy movies you'll like this movie, but don't expect it to do the poem justice.  I had to disassociate myself with the poem to enjoy this film.
B000002HJD|5.0|I've read in Blender magazine that they suggested to people that \\"this album should be avoided.\\"  How very wrong and sad!  I've owned this album since I was a kid (going on 15 years) and Jim Morrison had talent for evoking imagery in one's mind.  This man was not an amateur writer or poet for that matter.  He had God-given talent that was distinctive.  This is not a poetry reading by Jewel, this is Jim Morrison.  No disrespect to Jewel but here we're speaking of the lead singer for the Doors.  What I enjoy most about this collection is the trip I embark upon when I listen from beginning to end.  It makes me think of so many things such as travelling, music, sex, women, suspense, Latino culture, death, life and love.  The fact is I do not know Jim Morrison as a person.  Therefore, I have no right to judge his personal habits.  What I do know of him is that talent is talent.  Here he is doing what he loves to do with no pressure from a record company, an audience or police.  The accompaniment of the surviving Doors adds a special touch to the readings.  I appreciate owning a little piece of Jim Morrison's mind and for those of you who are just getting into Doors music, listen intently and try not to judge until you've finished the entire record.  If you don't like it, that's why we have return policies and refunds.
B00000JR2A|5.0|I love Tears for Fears. I love their over production, attention to detail, overlayering of tracks, and the general feel of their music. They represent the best of the 80's, of that there is no doubt. Seeds is not their best album, but it is a spectacular blend of many styles and has an overall feeling of otherworldliness. It seems that TFF is so often forgotten by MTV and VH1 when they speak of the eighties. All the hairband trash going down at that time and then you had the beauty and thoughfulness of TFF. I personally think that Everbody Wants To Rule the World was the best video and best song of the eighties (I know it was on Big Chair). Seeds is a very complex Beatles infused outing and worth every penny to own. I just wish these two would keep creating more music in this time of so much stuff being produced that is not worth listening to.
087349976X|3.0|This book seems to want to be a beginner's guide to bead and wire art.  It doesn't come close to achieving that goal.      If you are a bead and wirework novice (like me) do not purchase this book.  Wait until you have picked up a few skills, and have a few projects under your belt.  Then reconsider this book.    The book starts out with tools needed to use this book.  If you are a novice, this section makes a nice \\"to buy\\" list, but does not go into details like what each tool is used for or whether you really need it at all.  For example, it would list \\"round nose pliers\\" with a picture of a round nose plier.  Another example:  it would list a \\"wire twisting machine\\" with a picture of a wire twisting machine.  No discussion of relative merits of the tools, or brands, or any of that helpful stuff.    The book then has roughly 30 pages of \\"how to\\" instructions.  How to create a loop, how to wrap a bead, how to make a chain, how to make a toggle clasp, etcetera etcetera.      The instructions are very very adequate.  For example, a nine step instruction for something will only have four steps illustrated.  And the illustrations will be of the first two and the last two steps, not the complicated stuff in between.  And that's in the \\"how to\\" section, not the \\"project\\" section!  Not helpful.      The pictures that are illustrated, are not well thought out.  If the instructions indicate that a wire must be twisted so that it loops around itself (picture an \\"O\\" with a line across the top), the illustration will be a Microsoft Paint version of a circle, with a Microsoft Paint version of a line on top of it.  It WILL NOT show the loop, or any indication that the wire is of one piece, wrapped around itself.  It will look like two seperate wires.  This sucks for a beginner.  Not helpful.    FYI -- None of the projects require a knowledge of soldering.  It's all bead stringing and bead wrapping.    The projects are all rated by difficulty -- \\"Easy\\", \\"Intermediate\\", \\"Advanced\\".  This is good.  Helpful.    The pictures of the project are nice (in a shopping sort of way, not in a learning to make it sort of a way).  Cute but not helpful.    Each project has a list of tools needed to do the job.  Most seem fairly simple -- pliers, beads, wire, wire cutter.  Some projects require things like jigs and wire twisters and jewelry holders (if you want to braid the wire, there is a machine that holds onto the other end that the author recommends you buy).  She also recommends you have an anvil, a hammer, and a hammering block.  All good, but if you're going to tell people to buy a pile of stuff, knowing a little more about the pile of stuff would help, if not anything else to know how to shop for it.  At least in a book ostensibly geared toward - not just beginners - but novices.      A \\"for example\\" that is NOT in the book and I feel should be:  Why a hammer and hammering block?  To work harden the jewelry.  What does work harden mean?  Well, wire is very pliable.  Work hardening strengthens it and makes it less bendy.  The process can also add texture to a piece.  Caution:  do not over hammer, or the wire will break.    Another \\"for example\\" that would help in a beginner's book:  what type of wire to buy.  (This is also not in the book, but I feel it should be).  The book merely instructs that \\"18G wire\\" should be purchased.  It does not indicate - well, what does \\"G\\" mean?  Gauge.  What is gauge?  How wire is sold, based on numbers by American Society of Something or Other.  The larger the number, the smaller and more bendy the wire.  What type of wire -- copper? silver?  brass?  gold?  Does it make a difference?  How?  Why?    All these questions remain unanswered in this book.  For a true beginner's guide, purchase \\"Creating Wire and Beaded Jewelry: Over 35 beautiful projects using wire and beads\\" by Linda Jones, Paperback $13.59 and \\"Getting Started Making Wire Jewelry and More (Getting Started series)\\" by Linda Chandler, Hardcover, $11.53.Both are available on Amazon.  I purchased both for that hard core beginner's guide to beading and wirework.    Nice things I have to say about this book:    The projects make you want to buy this book.  They are lovely, and would be fun to make and wear.  They are in the trendy style of the bracelet on the cover.  They are creative, but not artsy.  They look like jewelry you could wear to work as a professional.  Some of the styles even an attorney could get away with in the office, though maybe not in the courtroom.  None of that awful big multicolored wire flower garbage, or beads strung on a wire and twisted into a spangled mess with feathers.    Final verdict:  If you are a novice or a beginner, definitely do not buy this book.  Consider the books I suggested above.  If you are an intermediate or advanced beader/wire worker, consider this book for its nice projects.  At that level, holes in instructions and crappy pictures mean less, it's the project ideas themselves that have value.

B000HWXS2S|5.0|I found Amon Amarth while studying the raid positions and battle strat against Illidan Stormrage in World of Warcraft. A guild called \\"Unskilled\\" posted their video of the battle and had \\"Cry of the Black Birds\\" playing in the background. I thought it was an amazing tune and came straight here and searched the song title and got the CD with   only hearing the one track. I never really got into AA in the past because of of all the viking stuff, but considering I love Leaves' Eyes...thats a bit strange; I just have a thing for female vocals I guess.    Anyway amazing work, every song is great.
1932907009|5.0|Blake's book is incredible. It takes the guesswork out of structure. He has made it easy to write. I was lucky enough to have Blake as a teacher in college and pass his teachings on to others at the college classes I teach. \\"Save the Cat\\" is my students' required reading. A true gem! Thank you, Blake.
B000VE439Y|5.0|I thought that Holy Grail was funny, but Life of Brian is funnier and better crafted.  It might offend some people's religious sensibilities, but it's not anti-religion, it's anti-dogma.  Palestine in those times (as now) was a melting pot of people and ideas, and the movie takes a humorous stab at reflecting that.  The immaculate edition adds only a little additional material.
0156027321|4.0|This book is baffling, at least it was to me.  As I was reading, I was pretty bored with the first 100 pages where Pi tells about the zoo animals and his search for God through different religions but once Pi got shipwrecked and found himself on a lifeboat with a tiger and some other wild animals, my interest picked up.  It's quite an adventure story and I enjoyed Pi's fight for survival, even though parts were very gross and at some points it didn't make sense (I wasn't sure if he was hallucinating or if it was just turning into a fantasy book).<br /><br />Then, as I finished the book, I realized it is a metaphor and there was so much to look back at and try to figure out what the author's message really is.  It's quite a book, a challenging read.  I recommend it to anyone who likes a thought-provoking book and strange endings.  It has suspense, adventure, humor and philosophy all mixed into it.<br /><br />--Karen Arlettaz Zemek, author of \\"My Funny Dad, Harry\\"
B0000041Q3|5.0|Siempre he pensado que en la obra maestra de Giacomo Puccini, que por cierto dentro de algunos días completara 82 años de haberse estrenado, abusa un poco del registro agudo y sobreagudo para dar forma a la pauta; igualmente en la modulación de la intensidad y volúmen orquestal; pero hay que pensar que no estaba terminada para cuando murió prematuramente; la embergadura de semejante obra deja pasmado al escucha más docto y exigente; es en si una obra de tales magnitudes que desde su entrada se prevee la exigencia a cada uno de los integrantes del reparto; basta decir que los solistas principales (prima donna e primo uomo) cantan con \\"la integral\\" del registro, al tope de sus posibilidades vocales; es una obra extraordinariamente difícil y exigente para los cantantes; por ende se necesita un equipo como este; nos muestra cosas interesantes y por demás geniales; Joanine canta como nunca antes me la hubiera imaginado, con una canto plano, sin coloratura, con exigencias dramáticas incoercibles; bien era conocido el dominio del reino sobreagudo, pero en esta ocasión fue mas allá de todo lo que imaginé; perfecta!!; el Calaf que apesar de lo que digan sus detractores, Pavarotti también sobrepasa lo esperado, que manera de emitir sus sobreagudos, que manera de mostrarse hasta cierto punto dramático (siendo una voz lírico spinto); un calaf que desde mi punto de vista llena perfectamente su rol; la maravilla de Caballé en su rol de Liú, con magistral dominio del pianissimi y con su perfecto dominio del legatto; corta participación pero perfecta también; el emperador de los Bajos, Nicolai Ghiaurov como Timur, espléndida voz ya también extinta, pero que con un rol pequeño llega hasta la fibras más profundas y sensibles, basta mencionar la escena del suicidio de Liú y de la plañidera voz quebrada por el llanto y la desesperación, saca lágrimas!!; la participación de los roles menores también a su nivel; la orquesta un tanto \\"stacatta\\" pero con una volumen correcto y bien temperada; coros ni que decir.... necesaria y obligada también...

B0000257U0|4.0|I had read that this was an excellent album from Toto, even described by Kerry Livgren (Kansas), as one of his favorites. The first track, Gift of Faith, is awesome. The next five songs are a little to soft for me but all are good songs. Then things heat back up with Turning Point and remain strong till the end with the stirring, The Road Goes On. There is also an awesome instrumental, Daves Gone Skiing. The production is maybe the best I've ever heard. Really stunning to the ears. This album is not quite as hard rocking as early Toto, but I guess you soften with age. Overall, I would recomend this as a must have for Toto fans and for those who appreciate highly talented musicians and excellent music.
B000SX9NAC|4.0|Here is the best electronic album from 07, and definitely LCD's strongest yet. While most of the cd is full of fun/quirky melodies and infectious beats, the highlight of the album - \\"Someone Great\\" - is subdued and melancholy. Possibly the best song of 07. Also, don't get the impression that this is a straight electronic album (The Field this aint), but this is definitely a rock album too. Party rock. Except for \\"Someone Great\\"... Just do yourself a favor and buy it.     Also recommend Battles' 'Mirrored'
B0015AARJI|5.0|This controller I thought was going to be really great. But it is not much better than the regular six axis. It has the rumble feature and is a little bigger and heavier than the six axis. That's pretty much it. I'm not going to  lie. It's a great controller but not the best. Besides, now I have two PS3 controllers. I recommend buying this controller.
B000VNMMR0|1.0|Okay, I know I'm in the very small minority, but this movie was bad. First lesson in story telling; your audience has to care about the characters. Secondly; the story has to be based in reality (unless it's SciFi).<br />This movie takes about two seconds to develop any character lines. The plot is so absurd and far fetched as to be funny. Let's see; the NYPD police officer goes over to Camden, New York to take in a hacker for questioning (without a warrant or probable cause). Apparently Camden has no police force, or county or state police, and the NYPD allows it's officers to drive some 5 hours out of the city outside their jurisdiction on something that doesn't concern them (as far as prosecution is concerned).<br />Now the NYPD officer (Bruce Willis) gets into a extensive gun battle; the apartment where the hacker lives is blown up, numerous people are killed, the apartment building is shot full of holes, but hey, apparently nobody calls police/fire/rescue, and Willis just drives away. I guess checking for anyone else being injured or calling the FD because the building is on fire would just slow the action.<br />Then there's driving an SUV up a parking ramp and thru a glass window into the \\"secure\\" computer control room. Bad building design and security; having the parking ramp and your secure areas only divided by a glass partition. Next you run down the female bad guy with the suv at about 40mph, but wait, she doesn't even get one injury! And the list goes on.<br />This movie is just a bunch of unbelievable special effects and stunts with a terrible story line that was put there as an afterthought.<br />If you like special effects and stunts, see this movie, but check your brain at the door.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|REM owed us an album like Accelerate. It´s simply brilliant, and brings hope to the today´s mediocre world of music.
0064430227|5.0|My five year old son loves this book.  It inspires creativity in kids to create what they can dream up.
0743486285|4.0|I have been a Crue fan since the 80's.  I really enjoyed this book and one of the good things about it is it's a daily diary so you can put it down and pick it up whenever you want and not really lose the thrust of the book.  One thing I learned is that Sixx is basically the entire brainchild of the band.  He wrote the music and the lyrics. If he played all of the instruments he probably could have recorded albums by himself (not taking away from the rest of the band - I think they're great). The fact that everything is coming from his diary gives the wild and crazy stories some credibility. I've read some of other RNR biographies and I just want to know how they can remember stories from 20 years ago in such detail - especially in the state of mind they were in at the time. I can't remember  what I did last week in that kind of detail.<br />The only reason I didn't give this 5 stars is the story gets a little monotonous in the last quarter of the book and the graphics and fonts are very cool, but I found them annoying to read.<br />If you're a Crue fan - buy this - you won't regret it.
B00132D808|3.0|The opening track to this CD, \\"We're So Starving,\\" includes the following lyrics:  \\"We're so sorry we've been gone / We were busy writing songs for you. / You don't have to worry 'cause we're still the same ....\\"  Unfortunately, only this track and the second track (\\"Nine in the Afternoon\\") even remotely begin to capture the \\"same\\" vibe or energy that \\"A Fever You Can't Sweat Out\\" gave.    I agree with previous reviewers that this album is \\"different\\" and that's not necessarily \\"bad,\\" but why mess with a good thing?  \\"A Fever\\" did well, and fans went crazy for their sound, because it had energy and zing.  It made me want to dance and sing along.  It made want to go to their concert and spend the entire time on my feet.    Now I have tickets an upcoming concert of theirs, and I can only imagine that if they play mostly songs from this album, I'll be sitting most of the time.  Maybe with a lighter or cell phone in my hand.  The tunes on this CD are decidedly downbeat and mellow, maybe a little cutesy in its subject matter, but all in all dull.  Fall Out Boy didn't take such a huge direction shift between its first two albums; they were smart.    And the worst part about it is, even if they wanted to go in a different direction, it's not even that good.  Comparisons to The Beatles are apt; the album (track 3 on) is definitely reminiscent of The Beatles, but it's boring.    So yeah, I'm a little disappointed by this album.  \\"Pretty. Odd.\\" and \\"A Fever...\\" are geared toward completely different audiences, or, at the very least, toward one person at two completely different mood periods.  That's fine, but when you're only two albums in, it's a confusing and inconsistent body of work.
B0011FXLCC|5.0|Seventh Tree is definitely a step back for Goldfrapp. Not in quality, only in time. I might have a soft spot for this record, because my love for Goldfrapp started with Felt Mountain, got deeper with Black Cherry, trembled a little bit when Supernature moved to the mainstream direction... With Seventh Tree the duo has returned to their roots, yet through a matured and more sophisticated approach. Many who like to have Goldfrapp on the dancefloor will be disapponted, but those who search for the touch that makes this band unique will love it.     And the artwork of the Deluxe Edition is really outstanding.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|The movie was well done and suspenseful. The characters were well developed, but the ending ruined the entire experience.  With just a little change this could have been excellent, but there is no good reason to make the movie have such a heartwrenching, depressing ending.
B00122M2QU|3.0|If you like Roots era Sepultura, you'll like this one....they really started the whole downtuned groove era with the heavier acts slowing down a bit, however oddly enough bands like Skinlab took the formula and improved on it....the new SkinnedAlive CD from Skinlab is on my must buy list of 2008, and I'm counting down the days until it's 4/29 release.
B000001ELF|5.0|Ace's Kiss solo album is excellent. It's a perfect representation of everything Ace - funny, emotional, genuine, killer riffs, brilliant chord progressions, and blazing guitar solos, and a little on the whacky side throughout.  1. Rip It Out - great opener for the album, sets the tone nicely. KILLER Ace guitar solo. This song rips!  2. Speedin' Back To My Baby - one of the coolest intro licks ever, classic Ace lyrics, it's all rock & roll  3. Snow Blind - a little weird yet great riff and progression, very atmospheric song that fits Ace perfectly  4. Ozone - the oddball yet brilliant partner to \\"Snowblind\\" the previous track. Brilliant riff and nice long intro. Killer guitar solo. Total Ace all around.  5. What's On Your Mind? - My favorite track on the album. Music, lyrics, vocals... all the epitome of Ace to me.  6. New York Groove - cool cover song, but not one of the stronger tracks and I was always surprised this was the big hit single  7. I'm In Need Of Love - heavy with an intense groove, one of the standout tracks for sure  8. Wiped-Out - again a little goofy, but Ace makes it work all the way  9. Fractured Mirror - Brilliant instrumental closer. One of the greatest guitar tracks of all time in my opinion.    Ace's post-Kiss solo albums never captured the same magic of this one from 1978. This is a great Kiss album and really just a great rock album.
B0011NVCO8|5.0|I was eager to see this movie because it's based on a real person, a real story, and because the cast is great. I like a movie that's not afraid to get a little dirty if that's what the story is about. This one is like that. It's not a prettied up, glossed over, there's some real grit there. This movie is also a trip, because of all the cop shows we see nowadays where everything is high-tech slick, this one takes us back to an earlier time in American history where underworld types were trying to carve out a niche. The consequences are real, not hollywood. They also tell you what happened to some of these guys later on. Real interesting, gritty, great actors. Check it out.
B000001ELD|5.0|Gene's is my favorite of the four Kiss solo albums. I just think it has the best songs. I like a lot of the variety and he can write a \\"ballad\\" that's still heavy and has an edge. This is a great \\"Kiss\\" album that any fan of the band's should enjoy.   1. Radioactive - nice opener, straight rocker, fantastic guitar solo  2. Burning Up With Fever - one of my favorite tracks, groovy  3. See You Tonite - Beatle-esque and simple, a true classic to me  4. Tunnel Of Love - another KILLER guitar solo and a real rockin' song  5. True Confessions - I love this song too, and the chior section adds some humor  6. Living In Sin - on the goofy side, but for Gene this kind of song is expected. The intro and phone call are classic.  7. Always Near You / Nowhere To Hide  8. Man Of 1,000 Faces  9. Mr. Make Believe - tracks 7, 8, and 9 for me make up a brilliant trilogy of powerful ballads. I love this triple shot and it's the climax of the album for me  10. See You In Your Dreams - While an unecessary remake of his own song with minimal differences from the previous version, it still rocks.  11. When You Wish Upon A Star - very lame song, very lame inclusion. I always stop after track 10. Thsi song has special sentimental value to Gene but I don't like it one bit    Still a five-star album despite the weak closer.
B0013D8LOK|1.0|blood and more blood.  Johnny Depp I thought was a better actor then to be in a such a bad film.
B000001ELP|3.0|I like The Elder. Note that I am a big Kiss fan, but I know they have their good moments and some serious duds. I think The Elder is about a five out of 10, maybe a six. It's an odd album for Kiss, because even though they dressed in costumes and were very into putting on a spectacle of a concert, a concept album or sort of rock opera release was something I never expected and was not well received at the time. I think this album has grown on people since it came out and is now semi-respected within the Kiss catalog.  1. Fanfare - good song, nice opener  2. Just A Boy - crazy falsetto by Paul, but I do like this song  3. Odyssey - Good song again  4. Only You - eh, not horrid not great either  5. Under The Rose - another \\"eh\\" tune  6. Dark Light - Ace Frehley pulls out a fantastic rocker, thank goodness. What a killer guitar solo!  7. A World Without Heroes - lame ballad  8. The Oath - another \\"eh\\" tune  9. Mr. Blackwell - interesting and different, especially for Kiss. I like this song.  10. Escape From The Island - awesome  11. I - nice closer, I like the music and chorus of this song even though the lyrics are super-weak and cheesy    If you're really into Kiss and picking up most of their stuff, The Elder is at the very least quite interesting and you might even like several of the tracks. It's way better than Unmasked.
B000Z27HLS|2.0|I have loved all the other Austen productions, some better than others, I could not get \\"into\\" this. It was too fast and yet quite boring to watch..will not be watching this time and time again as I do the other DVD's.....the casting was not great for some of the main characters and I think that had a lot to do with the negative opinions I have of this movie..thanks.
0452287588|1.0|I found upon reading the first few chapters, that this is not in keeping with the other metaphysical reading material that I am accustomed to perusing. Since we all have our own pathways, we each follow what resonates with us. I am not in sync with this path. The information is<br />well written.
B000OCXMAE|1.0|This cd is so lame compared to their older music.  I'm probably going to delete it from the computer.  Not recommended at all, unless you like hardcore people singing boring music.
B0014127BO|4.0|Bryan's voice has never sounded better.  This is a great CD, a mix of upbeat and laid back songs.  My favorites are Tonight We Have The Stars, I Thought I'd Seen Everything, Mysterious Ways, and Walk On By.  If you have enjoyed his last few albums, you'll like this one too!
0385486804|1.0|I read this book standing up at a bookstore in Anchorage. \\"That was a waste of time,\\" I mumbled as I walked off to look at the magazines with pictures of pick-up trucks and hot LA senoritas. Why people think this book is a good one is beyond me. I guess I'd be more interested in the psychological problems of trust fund babies if I hadn't spent ten years selling them bicycles in California. Since Sean Penn made the movie I've read the book two more times, and I even bought a copy. I honestly don't see why anybody enjoys reading this lightweight piece of trash. I've heard the movie is great, so I'll buy the DVD one of these days. But the book is a quick read with, as far as I'm concerned, no redeemable qualities.

B00008G9JN|5.0|This is one of the greatest Jethro Tull albums. Along with Aqualung and the live Bursting Out, Songs from the Wood would serve as a perfect introduction to Jethro Tull for kids not already familiar with their work.     For me, the stand out tracks are the \\"Songs from the Wood,\\" \\"Jack-in-the-Green,\\" and \\"Velvet Green.\\"    Songs from the Wood mixes exuberance and a deep respect for ancient music and traditions with a sense of humor. Absent on This album is the more cynical, bitter tone of humor and social satire found in Thick as a Brick and in songs like \\"Hymn 43.\\" It is replaced here with a more jubilant tone, as if saying \\"Life is fun, singing about it is fun, rolling in the grass all night with a young lady is fun!\\" (see \\"Velvet Green\\").    I cannot comment on the quality of this remastered release, as I am still listening to the tapes I made from my now nearly-worn-smooth vinyl LP. I have been reading very high praise for the sound quality of the recent Tull re-releases. This leads me to wonder, what are the producers of these CDs doing right that others are failing to? Perhaps Jethro Tull could also teach the recording industry a lesson in remastering CDs.
B000OV170W|4.0|My Sister's Keeper is a novel about a family struggling to stay together as one of their daughters suffers from leukemia and the other wants to stop being a donor for her sister.  Anna is born only because her older sister, Kate, has leukemia, and she has little hope to survive unless her parents find a perfectly matched donor for her.  Immediately after Anna is born, stem cells are taken out of her spinal cord for her sister, and since then she has had numerous surgeries, blood transfusions, and shots so that Kate can survive.  When the time comes that Kate needs to receive a kidney in order to survive, Anna begins to question who she truly is, and she makes a decision that could threaten the life of the sister that she loves--file a lawsuit for medical emancipation from her parents.  This would mean that Anna would get to decide what medical procedures she had to go through, avoiding those that could harm her.   The author's purpose for writing My Sister's Keeper was to bring out many emotions concerning Kate's suffering, and Anna's too for that matter, and make the reader think about how he or she would feel if he or she had a suffering sibling/child/relative/friend.  This book also demonstrates the fight of a parent for his or her child, and shows that they would do virtually anything they can to save them.  Jodi Picoult definitely accomplished this goal very well, seeing that this book made me think about my relationship with my siblings and realize how good I have it.  I even cried at the end, because of the shocking and extremely sad ending.     This book has many strengths, including the way it draws the reader in, so that he or she doesn't want to stop reading until he or she finds out what happens next.  Also, many of the characters are very easy to relate to, which makes the reader feel as if he or she is involved with the trial.  The only weakness that I can think of for this novel is how it is written with every chapter from a different point of view.  This makes it somewhat hard to follow when starting, but by the middle and end, it just flows like a normal novel would.     Jodi Picoult has received many awards for her novels including the 2003 New England Book Award for her entire body of work and she has also received the American Library Association's Alex Award for My Sister's Keeper.  Jodi Picoult has written twelve other novels, and has made the New York Times bestselling author list.  She currently lives in New Hampshire with her husband and three children.

B0014U4X3U|5.0|Just a quick note to let folks know that the Mobilereference edition illustrated is very nice. Most reviews speak of other publishers editions besides this specific one.<br />There lots of illustrations for all novels but none for Lady Susan.<br /><br />Download a sample of the book as it is quite generous in size.
B00009V7PJ|4.0|I like to listen to Cher, otherwise I would not have purchased this DVD. I prefer seeing the performer along with their music so I really like music DVD's. She is very flashy, but that is just her and you either like it or you don't. Some entertainers would probably look silly trying to do the same thing. She puts on a very entertaining program, but that is what we expect of her. I also benefited from the other reviews which helped me to purchase this DVD. I recommend this DVD although I probably could have done without a couple of her word choices. That kept me from giving it five stars.
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|I've followed the music of REM since their first US top 10 single \\"The one I love\\", but I really became a fan after the release of their 1994 \\"Monster\\" album (with great songs like \\"Tongue\\", \\"What's the frequency Kenneth\\" and \\"Crush with eyeliner\\"). That was about the time I was also getting into The Cranberries, 10,000 Maniacs, and The Smiths, opening my musical palette to include indie music but I digress.<br /><br />Accelerate (their fourteenth album) is a return of sorts to their earlier sound and like its name, is a full throttle ride of jaggedly energetic songs. The album is produced by Garret Lee, who has also produced albums for a pair of my favourite British indie bands; Editors and Bloc Party.<br /><br />At just over thirty minutes, the disc cuts right to the chase, with the exception of the epic ballad \\"Sing for the submarine\\" which is almost 5 minutes long. There's the sweaty shouty opening rocker \\"Living well is the best revenge\\", the sunny yet melancholic lead-off single \\"Supernatural superserious\\", the bouncy \\"Horse to water\\" (with a rapid-fire vocal delivery and a great chorus), the brief \\"Houston\\" (which references what must be the most popular hurricane in music history; Katrina), and the brilliant groovy \\"I'm gonna DJ\\" (with great Woo hoos), my favourite!<br /><br />Title track \\"Accelerate\\" does just that, an urgent indie number, while taking inspiration from George Bush (no less) is \\"Man-sized wreath\\" (taking a dig at a clumsy stage-managed appearance by Bush at last year's Martin Luther King day celebrations - \\"A pageantry of empty gestures, all lined up for me\\" sings Stipe). \\"Until the day is done\\" is a jangly acoustic song that reminds me a bit of John Lennon's \\"Working class hero\\".<br /><br />The album has already topped the UK charts (their seventh #1 There) and given them (at #2) their highest charting US album in almost 12 years. A welcome return from Michael Stipe and the lads.

0974872407|1.0|I've been reading the first 2 chapters in the web page of the author in Spanish and I'm surprised by the simplistic modern languaje used and the topic one direction of characthers. The description of the Books sementary seems from National Treasure III... Sorry but I expected too much from this overhyped book...Kind of Da Vinci Code mixed up with culebron (Latin soap opera TV). The languaje and constructions are too simple.Perhaps this is why is a best seller? I guess you can read it in an airport or some boring wait and throw it to the garbage after.  If you read a lot and like classics; this is not for you.
B000PKG7I4|5.0|I was introduced to Amy Winehouse when I finally purchased [[ASIN:B000N2G3RY Back to Black]] months after the CD had been released.  After hearing \\"You Know I'm No Good\\" and \\"Rehab\\", I still didn't know what to expect from the entire CD, so I decided to wait until a friend of mine finally convinced me to buy it.  The CD had an old school feel to it and my favorite tracks ended up being \\"Back To Black\\", \\"Tears Dry On Their Own\\", \\"Me & Mrs. Jones\\", \\"Love Is A Losing Game\\" and \\"Rehab\\".   I was seacrhing for music one day on amazon and I found out that she was   re-relasing a CD that she had previously released overseas in 2003 entitled \\"Frank\\".       The CD gets off to a nice start with the track \\"Stronger Than Me\\".  Amy speaks about a courtship where while she is 7 years younger, she seems to be the wiser of the 2 and she wants a man that is being just that, a man.  She doesn't feel that she should be the one telling him or advising him to be a man.   She expects him to already know those requirements.   It also seems that he wants a relationship and she just wants him to satisfy her in the bedroom only.   Things get even better with \\"You Sent Me Flying\\".   The track starts off as a piano led slow jam and midway through the track it becomes an uptempo track.   Amy talks about being caught off guard by the man that she was involved with kicking her to the curb.   This track sounds different than anything Amy did on \\"Back To Black\\".   There is no old school 60s or 70s track in the background.  The beat will remind you of a more up to date r&b track.   \\"Know You Now\\" has Amy wanting to get to know the man that she has just met.  Sometimes in relationships people want to take things slow and get to know the person.  In this instance, it seems as if Amy is on the fast track.  \\"F____ Me Pumps\\" is a funny but true tale about a particular type of woman.  This woman wants to achieve a certain type of status by dating and being seen with famous celebrities and/or athletes.   She also has no concept of commitment because they are so eager to live the fast life while they still have their physical attributes to get them what they want.   \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\", \\"Moody's Mood For Love\\" and \\"There Is No Greater Love\\" are all ballads that you heard and have come to love from Amy.  These tracks sound as if they were the blueprint to the ballads that are found on \\"Back To Black\\".   \\"I Heard Love Is Blind\\" is hialrious in some aspects because she is trying to find excuses for why she cheated on the man that she was with by saying since she was left alone for a particular time she had to \\"be\\" with someone.   She says that while she was with the other man, she wasn't cheating because she was thinking of her #1 man.   If you say so, Amy..lol   My favorite track ends up being \\"In My Bed\\".   Amy uses the beat from Nas' \\"Made U Look\\" from his   [[ASIN:B00007FZIJ God's Son]] CD.   Amy uses the track to create her own anthem about not wanting to catch any serious feelings for any particular man.   She still wants the benefits of \\"relations\\" but she doesn't want to be tied down to any 1 man.   The combination of the Nas track and Amy's lyrics and voice blend well together on this song.  \\"Take The Box\\" has Amy frustrated because while she doesn't have to lay her eyes on a man that she broke up with, she doesn't want to be reminded of anything that has to do with him.   She is coming to collect her belongings and in my opinion  she is mad because she had to come by his place & doesn't want to deal with the situation anymore after today.   \\"October Song\\" is an upbeat, midtempo track that is clearly different than anything that I have heard from her.  I am not use to any positive vibes coming from any Amy Winehouse track.   \\"What Is It About Men\\" has Amy questioning her ways when dealing with men in general.  She is trying to understand why she is weak when it comes to certain aspects about men.   \\"Amy Amy Amy\\" has Amy back to her devious ways when it comesto dealing with the opposite sex.   After listening to \\"Amy, Amy, Amy\\" and the Outro, which are both on Track 12, you will find yourself treated to 2 nice bonus tracks that are just as nice as the rest of the tracks on \\"Frank\\".   Track 12 clocks in at over 13 minutes long.    Overall, I feel that \\"Frank\\" is just as nice as [[ASIN:B000N2G3RY Back to Black]].  \\"Frank\\" is the perfect introduction to \\"Back To Black\\".  Once you listen to \\"Frank\\" you will notice certain aspects on \\"Frank\\" that made \\"Back To Black\\" the CD that it was.  The production is different on \\"Frank\\" in some instances because of the traditional r&b sound on some tracks, but the quality is still A+ in my opinion.  If you are a fan of Amy Winehouse then you should have both CDs in your collection.  Let's just hope that she gets her personal life together so we can continue to hear these great CDs.    James' Top 6    1) In My Bed  2) You Sent Me Flying  3) Know You Now  4) There Is No Greater Love  5) Moody's Mood For Love  6) F___ Me Pumps    Honorable Mention:    The rest of the CD (All of the tracks are nice)
B000068PQ0|5.0|For fans of the Flaming Lips this is just about as good as it gets, catchy lines, abstract concepts, and sounds so surreal, you could swear you were on something. The light and airy voice of the lead singer mixed with echoes and synth make for a truly unique experience, the whole album feels like a journey taken through some psychedelic fantasy world where robots and hypnotists rule. This is truly some of the best work by the Flaming Lips, and unless you were a huge fan of their albums from the eighties (those were more in the straight up rock variety), you will surely dig the funky surrealist vibe that radiates from each song on this disc.
B0001I55SS|4.0|The crew of the spaceship Palamino known as Captain Dan Holland (Robert Forster), Dr. Alex Durant (Anthony Perkins), Dr. Kate McCrae (Yvette Mimieux), Harry Booth (Ernest Borgnine) and special robot V.I.N.CENT (Voiced by Roddy Mcdowell) stumbles across a lost spacecraft called Cygnus far from the edge of a mysterious Black Hole. As they investigate, the ship is operated by scientist Dr. Hans Reinhart (Maximillian Schell) and his crew of robots who refused to be rescued because he wants to find the secrets of the mysterious Black Hole and wants to take the crew of Palamino with him.<br /><br />Entertaining Sci-fi thriller from Walt Disney Productions is their first PG rated motion picture, sure some of the effects are kind of cheesy especially the two robot buddies V.I.N.Cent and Bob who look unrealistic and kind of cartoony but some of the effects are very good for their time. It's a fascinating and dark epic into Science Fiction that Disney thought up in the wake of \\"Star Wars\\" since it made Sci-fi and fantasy popular again but bombed in theaters due to competetion against december 1979's other Sci-fi movie \\"Star Trek The Motion Picture\\". As of today, it has built a small cult following due to it's nature and scientific themes, it's worth a fan for fans of stunning cult Science Fiction.<br /><br />This DVD contains good picture and sound quality with two extras like a featurette and a theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Also recommended: \\"Event Horizon\\", \\"Heavy Metal\\", \\"Barbarella\\", \\"Lost in Space\\", \\"Forbidden Planet\\", \\"The Fifth Element\\", \\"Stargate\\", \\"Star Trek Saga\\", \\"Star Wars Saga\\", \\"Flash Gordon\\", \\"Total Recall\\", \\"Armageddon\\", \\"Transformers (1986 and 2007)\\", \\"2001: A Space Odyssey\\", \\"2010: The Year we Make Contact\\", \\"Battlestar Galactica The movie (1979 and 2004)\\", \\"Metropolis (1927 and 2001)\\", \\"Contact\\", \\"The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy (2005)\\", \\"Deep Impact\\", \\"Outland\\", \\"Superman\\", \\"Silent Running\\", \\"Alien Series\\", \\"20,000 Leagues Under The Sea (1954)\\", \\"Dark Star\\", \\"Logan's Run\\", \\"Lifeforce\\", \\"Dune (1984 and 2000)\\", \\"Zathura\\" and \\"Titan A.E.\\".\\"Lifeforce\\", \\"Dune (1984 and 2000)\\", \\"Zathura\\" and \\"Titan A.E.\\".
B00008S2VG|1.0|Probably Madonna's worst album ever, Madonna fails to achieve her concept, which some people tell me she was aiming for.  Okay, so let me preface this by saying that I am a certified Madonna nut...over a thousand Madonna items collected from the beginning, and I've seen Maddy in concert over 20 times.  I was even at the Confessions concert in London that's now out on DVD.  I love Madonna.  For me; however, it's always been the music.  I don't think Madonna has had a good album since ROL, but this is her worst...I mean, it's bad.  So, Madonna wants to make a concept album about the condition of the world (more celebrities preaching to us about the world...blah...blah).      Let's take the title track.  As a song alone, it is horrid.  Why is Madonna rapping in this song?  It falls flat and because it's lost in the nauseating grip of Madonna's rapping, I for one am not really sure what Madonna's message is. Okay, sure, we have the lyrics, but it's a lousy single.  And there is no passion in the song.  Madonna made a fantastic video to the song, and then pulled it for a dumbed down version where she sings in front of world flags so as not to offend.  What?!  The original version reminded me of the Like a Prayer days and it almost conveyed the message of the song, but she pulled it.  Whatever.    Let's move on to other songs...I'm So Stupid is SO stupid as a song, that I'm not even going to give it credence as a song.  Nothing Fails is a good song that stands out on the album.  It belongs on another CD.  Hollywood is another horrible...horrible track.  The problem with this album, as with COADF and Music is that she starts to mix her voice with computers and vocoders that you don't know who is Madonna and who is the imposter.  Why is it appealing to make your voice sound like a computer?  No Madonna fan has ever answered that question for me.  Sorry, I prefer real musical tracks like Like A Prayer over Paradise where her voice sounds like a computer terminal.  This albumsounds like Britney's Blackout in a lot of places...lol...and that's bad.  I thought the world was over when Madonna sang with Britney.  That song, Me Against the Music was the worst piece of trash I'd ever heard, but this album sounds like a Britney album.      Love Profusion is another worthless track...filler really.  I'm not even sure why a video was made for this song.  Nobody Knows Me is as nauseating as I'm So Stupid.  The other tracks aren't as bad, but cohesively, the album doesn't flow well.  It is Madonna's worst album.  Don't waste your time on this one.  You know, there was a time years ago, when I didn't think there could be a bad Madonna album, but I was wrong, and this is it.  Pick up Like a Prayer or Ray of Light instead and stay away from her newer ones.
0061373877|5.0|It is so awesome to hear Neil do the voices for all the characters in this book.  It's an excellent, exciting story, and the audio cd actually made me look forward to my drive to and from work for a while.
B000P12LWY|5.0|I am in love with this show... For Entertainment purposes the show is tons of fun... an amazingly beautiful cast of great actors, gorgeous scenery locations, and beautiful costumes from the time period. It may not be factual to history, but it is a TV Show. Many shows are intended for entertainment value and I believe thats right where this one is, loosely based on facts (but then again who really knows). I am a fan of the Renaissance/Medieval time period, but can enjoy this for what it is. Those that want a show strict to fact will be disappointed. However if you can sit back and enjoy the ride, knowing its extremely loose on facts, I can't see how you wouldn't love it :)
B000023VR6|5.0|The Doc bang's out all the hits on this one. I especially love track #3 featuring Devin the Dude. I fell in love with Devin's laid back flow after he sang the hook and rapped one verse of this track. I'm sure many of you became Dude fans too after hearing his smooth flows. Highly recommend you check out Devin the Dude's \\"Smoke Sessions Volume 1\\".
0743277457|5.0|i bought this book in may of 2007, and intended to write a review. I've been bashing my head trying to figure out how i can explain how much of an impact this book has been in my life. What i can say is that this book was written for all the right reasons.The author is not out to make a quick buck, this book is a revelation from a student of learning who has put these tools to work in high pressure moments from the last round of a chess tournament and the training before,to dealing with dirty refs in martial arts        It does not tell you what the path is but gives you the tools to make your own way. This wonderful book is not a mold for you to put your self in, but a guide, a priceless tool that aids you in your walk toward wherever your heart leads. i have been a victim of the New York City school system. i was told that i have a problem learning because i did not do well on the city wide tests, and the label has stayed       with me until my last days in high school when i dropped out. we don't have to label others anymore this book can help them find their own way to learn and fuel the pursuit of happiness. i have faith that this book has already changed so many lives  because i am one of them and you can be too
0385522401|5.0|On Chesil Beach is the story of the courtship and \\"marriage\\" of Florence Ponting and Edward Mayhew.  Our lovers are star crossed; or rather are crossed by their hang ups,  their milieu, their families, and their culture.  Like so many petty personal disasters, their disaster is really mostly just a result of their youth.   Although there is no violence, no one is even physically injured, like the other McEwan novels I have read, On Chesil Beach is disturbing and even nauseating in some ways. This book is not for children.  It is for adults and is about what an awful struggle it can be to become an adult. The reader should beware that this is not an easy book.      McEwan is a magician with words.  Without any verbal pyrotechnics of the sort we expect from for example John Banville, he conjures a story and characters that are much larger than the 200 pages of this book.  McEwan is a master, a genius of plain, clear English prose, and helps us to appreciate the simple beauty of our mother tongue unembellished with the arcane words and weird grammatical constructions and misconstructions of the sort we find in so much fancy writing of today.  McEwan's style permits us to focus on the characters, the story, and on ourselves, and not on how clever the author is--there's no showing off here (and yet McEwan is clever, very very clever but with a modesty that is so becoming).    In this wonderful novel McEwan deals with much more than failure of communication and the difficulty of growing up.  The topics that he fascinatingly brings to life are the Sexual Revolution and how in many ways things have gotten better for us because of it, the poignancy of aging and lost hopes and missed opportunities, the jungles that we call families, and the way in which problems with our personalities if left to fester will exact their damage.  It is about sex, and love, and marriage.  As with many of McEwan's other novels the swirling life of London is a backdrop and almost another characterin the story.    This novel left me wondering, too.  There are some implusibilities in the plot that never get explained.  There are other issues I do not fathom such as why Chesil Beach?  What is the meaning or symbolism of this title and location?  Is it the barrenness of it?  I wonder if Florence and Edward ever could have found happiness in the way that Edward at the end thinks they might have.  In a way I wish that McEwan had written a longer, more complex novel that confronted these wonderings of mine; but to hold that On Chesil Beach is in any way flawed would be almost a blasphemy.  These wonderings are a gift to the reader because they absorb us as part of the plot which is also about wondering.  On Chesil Beach is a gem, a jewel just as it is.
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|This film is absolutely brilliant. The fast paced movement of this film and the pure sense of claustrophobia it creates amazes me. There are so many good things to say about this that I dont know where to begin. I can only mention a few because my review would take too long.  I really feel that \\"Cloverfield\\" is destined to become a classic giant monster movie. Up there with the ranks of \\"Godzilla\\", and \\"The Host\\". I was on the edge of my seat the whole time due to the non-stop action and pure tension. The special effects are outstanding and the editing is fantastic. People have complained about the movement of the camera creating a nauseating feeling.  I say .. Cool. That is what \\"Cloverfield\\" is about. It's about 4 people who happen to have a camera looking for a way to get out of harms way. Yes, at times it's nauseating to watch because of the movement but that only adds to what the film is. Trust me, this movie is Awesome. Believe all the good reviews that it has received. I only hope that this can be the start of a \\"New wave\\" of horror films featuring giant monsters. \\"The Host\\" Kicked butt and \\"Cloverfield\\" rocked.  Let's do away with the current wave of sadistic torture horror movies and replace it with Kaigu - Giant monsters. I promise you will like this movie. Enjoy!
B000002J1I|5.0|Yes has many classics that are more accessible. Start with those. If you have fallen in love with Yes, try Relayer, Tales and Tormato. These sound awful at first, but will grow to be your favorites.    I would begin with Fragile and The Yes Album (dated but if you can imagine the music of the time, this would have sounded incredible.)    Yessongs is live and accessible and a good next one to try.     The turning point will be \\"Close to the Edge\\". If you love it, you'll be able to listen to it for years. If it is too much for you, skip the rest, and admit you just do not want to put that much effort into music.    If your really getting into it at this point just get the rest of them. Interestingly enough I would say the worst is \\"Going for the One\\", which is good, but made during a period of confusion among the band, whether they should pander to the public and deliver more pop or continue with what made them interesting: progressive rock.    The same issue killed EL&P. It broke up Yes. Musicians who continue to experiment risk losing fan base. For instance Rick Wakeman continued a rich flow of music, much of which eroded his fame.     Successful artists in this vein, like Chick Corea and Pat Metheny have found niche audiences, which is a shame. I once saw Chick Corea play in a  small performance room at the College of DuPage. Literally 50 people showed up for a fantastic show combining Jazz with a small classical orchestra. I also saw Bill Bruford (Yes drummer) play with keyboardist Patrick Moraz in a tour named \\"Music for Piano and Drums\\" which was great fun. Perhaps two hundred showed up for that in Chicago.    Many of these \\"Super Bands\\" continue to look for that sound that will put them back into stadiums. However that was a fad. I was always amazed at the number of casual listeners who showed up. Now that the fad is past, let the casual listeners attend pop concerts, and hope brilliant musicians put music first and forget about mass appeal. If it comes again,great. But don't lose your core audience trying to compete with Brittany or the other Disney-hyped commercial attractions.
6304698682|5.0|Not very original (Clint got some ideas from previous westerns) but probably the coolest Clint Eastwood western of all time. Although \\"Unforgiven\\" was more realistic and \\"The Outlaw Josie Wales\\" had a better story, this one is cooler. The \\"Preacher\\" was also a better character than \\"The Stranger\\" from \\"High Plains Drifter.\\" They should definitely put this one on HD DVD or Blu-ray.
B0014BC3C2|4.0|\\"It is no use to blame the looking glass if your face is awry.\\"<br />~Nikolai Gogol<br />This is one of those movies when you are presented with a different point of view.  So scared of our own shadows that we grasp at straws and assume that those in charge have our best interest at heart.  We assume that they are not only looking out for us, but when attempting to \\"combat the enemy\\" (whomever that might be??) - we like to think that all is on the up and up and that even the assumed guilty will be treated like human beings.<br />Although, this is a work of fiction... I have NO DOUBT that some if not all of these practices occur.  I shutter to think of high ranking officials or people of power trying to get information at any means possible.  I believe as the movie shows that for every 1 person tortured .... many enemies will be made.  It scares me to think of what goes on behind closed doors and gets hidden from us...for our own good (i imagine they tell themselves).<br />I do not know what the answer is to all of this, but after watching this film a knot in my stomach tells me that this can't be the way.<br />The acting was spot on and the script seemed so believable.<br />I think this is a \\"must watch\\"!!!<br />If nothing else...<br />I hope it gets people thinking and talking!<br />e.
B00001X590|4.0|Joe Cocker really takes the crown as the king of Beatle covers with his take on WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS. And it's the perfect title for the album because he had more than a little help cutting these sessions with many of England's top rock musicians. He covers Dylan and others in fine fashion and his singing is just superb. An honest to god soul man. He could have easily showed up at the Stax Records studio in Memphis and made an even a better record than this one. And that's the only reason I don't give this record 5 stars. The playing here is quite good but the production is a little heavy handed. I'm one who actually slightly prefers his self titled follow up album  because there's less of that deep reverb, layered sound. Having said that, this is still a great record. Joe's screamin' howl during the second bridge of the title track, is simply unequaled in the history of Rock 'n Roll.........
B000RF7XYO|4.0|I was interested about English history and this film, along with Elizabeth: The Golden Age, are great for understanding the beginning and continuance of the Elizabethan Age.  Extremely well put together and superb acting make this film a keeper.
B0010ZR160|4.0|This was a very good movie with what I thought was a very disturbing ending. Had I been the one in Ben Afleck's shoes I don't know that I would have done anything differently but you know it wasn't the best decision to make, it ended up costing him everything.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield: The Monster from the Internet    It's been over a week since I took my wife and kids to see Cloverfield at the local cineplex. My wife, who is generally hard to please, liked it. But, she thought the shaky hand held camera work detracted from the overall experience. Both my pre teen children loved it. They seemed generally terrified at all the right parts and ate their popcorn in a most hypnotic manner. My reaction was only slightly more nuanced. I liked the movie, but I just felt like there was too much missing.   My biggest complaint is the camerawork. All the jerky movements and blurred shots got old after the first five minutes. I was bored to tears watching poorly shot asphalt and off kilter shots of running feet. Let's face it, it's a gimmick. The subpar cinematography does not enhance the theatre going experience.   The plot of Cloverfield (or what passes for a plot) revolves around an extremely attractive group of twenty-somethings who brave impossible odds to rescue the male lead's ex-girlfriend. In a major suspension of belief, they head towards the center of the city as a gigantic mutant ravages New York, eating people and knocking down skyscrapers.   This brings me to my next point. Cloverfield's script borders on incoherence because it explains nothing. And, believe it or not, this is what fascinates me the most about this movie.   The main plot points and explanations do not exist in the movie. They exist on the internet.  The producers of Cloverfield have set up a series of internet sites that provide the answers to most of the questions posed in the film. Now these sites all fit into the mythos that the makers of Cloverfield have created. The sites include on line comic books, fake Japanese corporations, soft drink ads and more.   If you visit all these sites and take in all the content provided therein the movie will suddenly come into focus. This is ironic considering how out of focus the actual movie is.   The producers of Cloverfieldhave taken the \\"Blair Witch\\" concept and taken it up a notch.  This is not a film release in the classical sense...this is a true multi media event taking full advantage of the internet. Maybe that's why it is hard for me to like this film. It takes personal time and investment to truly appreciate it. You can't just sit in the theatre and watch the movie, not if you want to understand what's going on. You have to research it. You have to invest time and effort outside of the movie going experience.   It has become clear just how conflicted I am regarding this movie. After visiting the connected internet sites I now understand the movie and what it's about. So I'm enjoying the movie more after the fact. I'll leave it up to you to decide whether or not that's a good thing.  So in the end I will give Cloverfield 4 stars out of five. The film deserves that rating if nothing else for the sheer innovation of its packaging.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|When I saw this film I had actually no idea it was a musical, so I was quite surprised to hear the opening song. Normally I'm not really a musical fan, and I also believe, that this movie could have been done better as a standard, straight (pardon the expression) Tim Burton feature film. Don't get me wrong, it is still a very good film. But not as good as it could be.    The acting is, as you'd expect with this cast, top class, and the direction is beautiful and accomplished. The music, which obviously plays a big part in this film is also very good and the singing is surprisingly not ear shattering (they are actors, not singers after all).     However, the, by far, best thing is the dark, gloomy, sad, corrupt, bleak, forlorn feel that director Tim Burton drapes over this motion picture. It is a thing that only a handful of directors master, and probably none as well as Burton. The imagery, the colours, the looks of the actors. It all combines to create this wonderful murky atmosphere of desolence and despair. Magnificent.    I subtract a star for the singing bits because I honestly think it would've been better as a normal feature film, but it is still highly recommendable and definitely worth watching.
B000N3ST9I|2.0|I agree with the reviews....so incredibly overated....sounds just like 'More things Change'........far too predictable at this point with the changes and the 'spooky sounds' that go to the heavy parts......I should have bought the Fozzy CD sooner, which by the way, is amazing.....
0452289963|1.0|There are some very good points in this book but the Bible is Gods Word and there is only one way to God, through his Son Jesus Christ. To deny the Basics and say there are many ways well all I can say is I burned the book so my copy would not go forth. Don't get caught up in the garbage. Look to God not Man.
0452289963|5.0|Not everyone is able to resonate with what Eckhart Tolle is writing about because Consciousness, Enlightenment, and Awareness cannot be described in words because words do not do justice to the arising calmness, alertness, and serenity ones feels when they've attained that sense of balance.  That is why some will praise the book while few may feel an aversion to it.      If this book can make anyone think twice about their own actions instead of pointing the finger at others, then I believe the author has succeeded in awakening a new level of self consciousness in human beings.  I believe the greatest gift this book can give to the public is the understanding that suffering is created by our own ego with its endless desires and discontentment with what is.      It doesn't matter what religion or spiritual group you belong to, this book unveils a side of YOU that is definitely worth further contemplation and introspection in.  If everyone can learn to look within ourselves first rather than placing judgment on others, we would be living in heaven on earth!
068987474X|5.0|When I first read this book I was amazed at how much crap and excuses I put up with.  Then after some time I started dating someone, who I got really serious with, he showed a lot of \\"into me\\" signs.  But I should of never packed away this book b/c it turned out as time went by this guy started showing the \\"I'm not that into you\\" anymore signs and as I go back and read this book again I wish I had remembered a lot of it.  It would of saved me a lot of wasted time and heartache with a person who was never really right for me.  Thanks Greg! Your Awesome!
0596101996|5.0|Authoritative, very well written, very well structured, complete, a pleasure to read.  The intricacies of Javascirpt are very well explained, it might not be an easy read for the average script kiddie but if you want a book that thoroughly describes the language and its browser integration, events, dom,  css handling ... look no further.
B00005JKQZ|5.0|I LOVE this movie. Russell Crowe gives a wonderful performance. It is the story of one man's battle with mental illness and would be an inspiration for anybody, with or without problems. I highly recomend it to anybody.

B000UR9T8C|2.0|Despite the fact that I own hundreds of spidey comics, really enjoyed the first two movies and nearly staked out the theatre for weeks before its openning night. I found spiderman 3 to be crappy, predictable, and a blackeye to the spiderman franchise.<br /><br />To date, I've yet to see the full ending of this movie, since having walked out of the theatre. To the best of my knowledge, mary janes still stuck in that taxi cab above NYC.
B0002W4SWC|5.0|I wish they had a six star rating... I love this movie.  It is one of a select few that I can watch over and over and not get bored.  (If you really want a treat- read the sequel!  SOOOOOO funny.)  It helps too if you know the storyline for Pride and Prejudice- makes it even more delightful.<br /><br />My friends and I choose this one time and time again- so if you're in need of a  good romantic comedy... reach for Bridget.  With that in mind definitely not for the younger crowd- there is some pretty crass language and content in there at times (there is a reason it's rated R).<br /><br />(On a side note... I actually preferred the movie to the book.  It's rare that I side with the movie... as they usually always butcher the plotline... but in this case their changes/additions really added some flavor that was lacking in the book version.)
B0006J28KU|5.0|Al Pacino and Robert de Niro together. Frankly, I think that's a good enough reason to see any movie, but even if it weren't for those two brilliant actors, Heat is a must-see film. The script is utterly brilliant, full of action and three-dimensional people doing what they must. The shootout scene is quite spectacular and the \\"supporting\\" cast is an embarrassment of riches: Tom Sizemore, Val Kilmer, Ashley Judd, Natalie Portman, Jon Voight, Hank Azaria, etc. This is a long movie (almost three hours) and every scene, shot and minute are utterly riveting.
B000244FDW|5.0|My good friend and I started watching this movie for the first time about six years ago, before I had read the book.  We, who both LOVED the 1995 version- turned this version off about only ten minutes in!  We couldn't stand the 80's way that it was filmed... and didn't like the characters one bit.<br />Well... after now having finished the book- this is my favorite version!  It is so true to the story- and I think that the casting job was extraordinary.  This Elizabeth is more like the girl Jane Austen writes about- not angry and mad at Darcy the way that Kiera Knightley's Elizabeth acts- but a clever and endearing young woman.  So... if you're' like me and at first you didn't like this... first read the book then try again :)
B000XGDO04|5.0|Quality CD from a genuine talent, truly gifted. Song writing needs to match the voice but I'm sure that will come, some great tunes here just not quite up to the vocals which are breathtaking, buy it.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|I had never read, or heard of, this book/movie before.  I saw the optimistic reviews for it though- and was amazed that this movie had a 5-star rating as average!- so I rented it.  WOW!  I was DEFINITELY not disappointed!  I can't wait to read the book now, as it's such a wonderful story line.<br /><br />The actors are wonderful!  The cinematography is wonderful!  The editing and music is wonderful!  All in all it's a terrific period piece well worth the watch.<br /><br />Also, this is available on Netflix as an \\"Instant View\\" movie- so if you have Netflix you can watch it from home w/o waiting for it in the mail :)
B0002XNSY0|5.0|Good example of a 40 years old madness that don't go away. Almost as much significant today as it was in 1964.
0143038419|5.0|I didn't think I would enjoy this author's book as much as I did because in getting to know her within the beginning pages, among other things, here was what I considered a somewhat shallow-souled woman.  It turns out, I did enjoy the book because of Ms. Gilbert's writing style.  She weaves the serious with the quirky, frank and outspoken, making the book fun to read.  The interesting characters she meets on her journeys to Italy, India and Indonesia all come to life as well.  Long before the ending of the book, I came to admire Ms. Gilbert for many of the qualities she possessed, mostly her free spirit. A friend sent me this book in hopes of helping me through my own journey (the heavy-duty journey through the Grief of losing my only and beloved son) and I'll admit this book did give me a reprieve for a few long stretches of time.
B000JBWWBK|4.0|Love the cd but my favorite song from the movie was not on the cd.
0307341550|1.0|I don't understand what all the hype is about. This book was a let down. I was expecting more.   The characters were flat and I don't know if anyone else feels the same, but I just couldn't feel anything for them. Especially, the detective. It was like reading an article about what happened... There was no emotion in the story.The characters seemed detached.   Also, the story didn't have much action building the mystery. From the beginning to the next to the last chapter, it was on a single plane-no building up of clues- then Whammo!! the ending came. And yeah, it had a twist but it wasn't as shocking as it could have been.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I bought this after the reviews in Collage and have not been disappointed, you think yeah a 25 minute workout isn't going to do much then you do the workout.    There are three levels 1, 2, and 3 and the intensity of these goes up according to the level you chose.    The set up for the workout is 3 minutes of strength with combo moves, 2 minutes of cardio and then 1 minute of abs.  You repeat this 3 times with different exercises and moves for all three sections.  This one even includes a beginners option for all three levels, way better then her winning by losing series in my opionon.  It's hard but effective and you can see results such as endurance after only a few workouts.  I like that your are getting the maxium results in this short block of time.  I've been very happy with the 8 pounds I've lost since starting this program.
B000VNMMR0|5.0|As is usual, videos from Amazon arrive quick and in great shape. The movie itself has to be the best sequel in the series. I especially like the hacker as a great sidekick and all around interesting character.
B000O179EK|4.0|Only the Coen brothers could create a wonderfully fantastic, completely improbable film and make it totally engrossing.  From Jeff Bridges' laid back stoner, Dude, to John Goodman's Vietnam veteran, gun tottin', wired for sound character, to Peter Stormare's ferret loving nihilist.    The most impressive scene has to be the bowling musical number during a dream sequence.  Combining bowling with viking imagery is always something one thinks of.  The pull it all off with characteristic wit, charm, and occasional violence.    One of the Coen's best, right up there with Raising Arizona and Fargo.  Don't miss it.
B0010ZR160|1.0|For the most part i've respected Ben Affleck because i felt his movie choices and acting talent were both very impressive. I've always perceived him as a person with integrity of character and with that said i was really looking forward to his directing debut.     But about twenty minutes into gone baby gone, and my senses being assaulted by the incredible amount of vulgarity pouring out of the tv into my livingroom...not to mention finding the story line really confusing, it felt like long enough to want to waste another minute watching this movie.
B0013FBS20|4.0|I love I am Legend, the book.  Richard Matheson's portrayal of loneliness, isolation, and eventual insanity and redemption was always one of my favorite books.    The original movie, The Last Man on Earth, was good and came fairly close.  The Omega Man, the second try, was more of a campy affair, but it's one of my favorite movies.    This one has got to be one of the most faithfull to the core of the book.  Will Smith, in a very poignant performance, captures the core of what the book was about.  This is a very hard movie to carry, even for a star of his caliber, because for most of the movie, he's by himself.      I loved it, from the empty spaces of Manhattan to the wandering animals in the streets, it's eerily portrayed as the aftermath a plague and it works well.  The direction isn't frenetic, characterization is great.  The only complain I had was the creatures.  They look too computer generated.  Minor complaint for an otherwise great movie.    See it, if you haven't seen it already.  The blu-ray version has excellent color definition and the sound punches the experience up greatly.    If you like Will Smith, or just want to see what would happen if you were the only person left on Earth, this is the movie to see.
B0010YSD7M|4.0|What is there to say?  It's SG-1.  You know the stars.  You know the characters.  This DVD does tie up many of the \\"loose ends.\\"  My major problem is that it does so WAY too quickly.  It takes what could have been up to a season's episodes worth of story lines and resolve them about the time of a two-parter.  The budget is clearly higher per minute of on-screen time than the weekly series.  But budget was never a weakness of the series.  \\"Stargate SG-1\\" was consistently great with what it had.    Other than being unsatisfied by the breakneck pace, \\"The Ark of Truth\\" is a useful, if temporary, fix for everyone who lost a major source of entertainment pleasure with the ending of the Stargate SG-1 series.    So, now I want my \\"Continuum.\\"  More importantly, what about after that?  \\"Atlantis\\" is fine in its own right.  But nothing replaces \\"SG-1.\\"
0345479092|4.0|Her plan is not about rigidity.  It is simple to keep a child on a pattern.  To Eat, to have Activity, to sleep and then to find time for You!  Plus, keeping my daughter on this pattern taught me her cues - what her noises meant.  As a first time mom I needed this book to get me through the language barrier.  I put my daughter on this pattern right away and by 2 months she was sleeping through the night and expecting her naps to come when they did.  She is now 6 months and is a breeze to care for.      The plan gives the baby guidelines to work with and I can see how my daughter responds positively to it.    What I took away from this book was the EASY plan and the introducing food/weaning baby off boob plan.  I wasn't sold on her breastfeeding ideologies.  They just didn't work for me.  But those other two lessons have made my life drama-free.
B00132D808|3.0|What struck me most, just as all the other people who've listened to this CD, is that it was so different from its predecessor. And that's really not a bad thing; on the contrary. Yes, A Fever was a brilliant piece of an art. But Pretty. Odd. shows that they can do so much more than make music with a serious undertone and they show that in this album. I have to agree, it doesn't get inside your head and some songs are pretty similar, but I think that also has to do with the 'Curse of the Second Album'. If the first was really good, it's common that the second can't compare. But that's not a reason not to like the album.
B00005ATQ9|1.0|This package promising a \\"New Digital Master\\" widescreen DVD turned out to be an old, washed out fullscreen pan and scan. Buyer beware! These product profiles can be maddeningly incomplete, if not downright deceptive. Customer service has promised a full refund, but I'd been looking forward to seeing the movie again, even if it was only the \\"2000\\" edition. Though I've been a happy book customer for years, this was the first DVD I'd ordered from Amazon, and it'll probably be the last. Who needs the inconvenience?
B000056VJ7|5.0|Love Meatloaf!  Especially Bat Out Of Hell.  last song is a live version!  Must get!
0739313126|1.0|This book is awful. No, really, awful. Just put it down and go read something else. Anything else will certainly be better. And likely less insulting to your intelligence.<br /><br />I understand that the puzzles were supposed to be part of the charm. I suppose if you like the puzzles, you can be forgiven. For me, this book was made up entirely of predictable drivel that lead nowhere I haven't seen handled better elsewhere. I didn't need to spend time on the puzzles as their answers were as predictable as the rest of the plot.
B00008J4P5|3.0|Not great, but good.  There's a few songs on there I'd listen to more than once.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Upon reviewing the DVD, I thought \\"oh this is easy.\\" NOT, although the moves are pretty basic, Jillian gives a great workout.
B000068OSK|3.0|I bought a few of their CDs.  Some songs are good.  Not for everyone.
B000WAGVHE|5.0|Excellent image and sound, very good songs and great dancing. Very good performances by all actors, specially the new girl...charming young lady!<br />Highly recomend this movie, will cheer you up!
006054094X|5.0|Excellent book. This should be publicized more by the media. It should also be recognized by the academic community. There is such a preponderance of supporting material that it is incontrovertible. It should be made part of the historical record in text books.
0307237702|4.0|Oh how I wish the world were as wonderful as he wants it to be...<br /><br />Senator Obama spends a great deal of time laying out the many injustices of our current democratic system.  In fact, he does it so well, that anyone uneducated on the subject matter, could become severly depressed.  As the opening chapters flesh out, there was a time (over 50 years ago) when Democrats and Republicans did not hate each other so much.  When phrases like \\"vast right-wing conspiracy\\" weren't invented yet.<br /><br />He goes on to explain that our assumption that people who disagree with us on one issue are morally different from ourselves is false.  For example, let's say we disagree on abortion , does that mean we also disagree on teh death penalty?  Of course not.  But, as far as many politicians are concerned, they can never see eye-to-eye on any issue if they disagree on even one of them.  In fact, some people have even gone so far as to outright disagree with everything the other candidate says, just because of a deep-seeded hatred.<br /><br />This is Senator Obama's mission: to fix this imbalance and get people to understand that we do agree on several fundamental issues no matter what side of the fence we vote on.  He even says that despite social and economic differences, most Americans agree on the basic principles of family, freedom and life.  His book attempts to prove this by showing both sides of important issues and focusing on the common ground they share.<br /><br />Is this effective?  Well, I gave the book 4 stars, because it's simply ineffective IF because the current politicians he is speaking about are the people who NEED to learn these things.  However, they are not his target audience.  this book is written for Joe Public and reads more as a jab at politics than as a corrections manual.<br /><br />HOWEVER!  I believe that if enough \\"average\\" people read the book, they CAN influence the current political system over time.  It is a democracy, after all.
B000WMFZMY|5.0|I love these big epics from the 30s-60s, and Samuel Bronston was almost as good at churning them out as the master, Cecil B. (besides El Cid, he notably did such classics as Fall of the Roman Empire, 55 Days at Peking and King of Kings), and El Cid is one of his best.    It has awesome production values (a great climactic battle scene and the best one-on-one joust ever filmed, bar none) and a very entertaining story. The acting is first rate, not only from the stars (I think Heston gives one of his best, most restrained (if that is the right word) performances and Sophia Loren never, ever looked more beautiful) but also from the supporting actors, Raf Vallone and Gary Raymond, in particular.  All in all, a very enjoyable way to spend a few hours.    One other thing.  An aspect of films often overlooked is very much in the fore here, the background musical score.  It is an aspect of films, especially epic specataculars, that is absolutely essential to the complete experience and this one is scored by one of the great masters of the genre, Miklos Rozsa (Ben-Hur, Double Indemnity, Julius Caesar and so on ad infinitum), at the absolute top of his form.  I hope someday that someone does a release of the FULL score on CD and gives it full justice, something long overdue.    I'm not one of those folks who necessarily thinks that older is better, but I do think Hollywood either has forgotten how to (or more likely can't afford to) make these spectacular costume epics like they once did.  Epics today are made for the MTV generation, which may not be bad, but it's certainly different and not as much to my taste.    Test it yourself. Watch this movie and say Spartacus or Ben-Hur and then watch Gladiator and say any one of the Superman movies. You might be surprised by which one has more satisfying acting, writing, plot-lines, set pieces and music (although I must admit Williams' score to Superman I is one of the half-dozen best ever composed).    At any rate, thanks for this one Sam.  You'll find it money well spent.  Bring on Fall of the Roman Empire and 55 Days, please!!!
B00004S3AN|4.0|The music itself is very good, but not great I would have liked more sax, horns.  (This is coming from a Steely Dan fanatic)  However, for a recording that is nearly 50 years old, the sound is fantastic, most people couldn't tell the age.   My main comment is that the SACD surround mix is TOO subtle.  I thought my player wasn't working.  I have yet to compare the CD version to the SACD version.  Maybe the SACD version is better, but I was hoping for a better surround mix such as Avalon.
014241011X|5.0|I think this is a really good book. It is mainly about a nine year old boy who has a very sweet grandma and sets off to stop the witches from vanishing all the children. It is not just funny, it is also frightening. The part I like the best if when the witch turns the boy into a mouse.
0321544080|5.0|I enjoyed the pictures, but what kept me reading was the story behind the pictures.  I found the accompanying stories highly entertaining and interesting (Joe McNally has lived a very interesting life).  I also enjoyed the description of the technical aspects of how Joe got the shot.  For those looking for a complete technical guide to photography will be disappointed.  However if you are interested in great photographs with often times hilarious commentary on what it took to \\"get the shot\\" from one who has lived the \\"photog\\" life for 30 years you will be well rewarded.  I look forward to the sequel.
B0013FYTA8|4.0|Though I didn't like this album quite as much as the first two, it is still a good album.  Yes, there are similarities in sound and vocals between Nickelback and TOAD, but one of the greatest distinctions, in my opinion, is whereas Nickelback tends to only have 2, maybe 3 good songs per CD with the rest just filler, virtually every song on a TOAD CD is decent, and there is never a bad song.  Personally, I like TOAD better.  They rise above Nickelback in just about every aspect except fame. I hope they eventually earn the fame they deserve.
B00006NSGX|3.0|I enjoy listening to this set a good deal.  It's a good collection of material from a live performance, good but not great.  There's too much of an emphasis on Cream material whereas I had enough of that when I purchased 24 Nights several years ago.  The whole thing should have been laid back, like in the style of Reptile or Change the World.  I am back to buying all Eric Clapton releases after getting annoyed with him after the release of August back in the 1980s.  I even liked the Road to Escondido.  Glad to have you back, Eric !
0689865384|5.0|I purchased several copies of this book for a Book Club with my 6th grade class - they absolutely LOVED it, and everyone of them is trying to get ahold of the next book in the series, The Pretties.  This is a great science fiction book, especially for girls.  So many Sci-fi books are written for boys, but this book focuses on the future as well as what's important to so many girls today - the way they look.  I truly believe that you should be a different person after you read something, and Westerfield has done an excellent job of changing the way readers look at technology, vanity, and the future.
B000O179EA|5.0|ITEM ARRIVED IN PERFECT CONDITION AND VERY FAST SHIPPING. I WOULD DEFINATELY ORDER FROM SELLER AGAIN!!!!!
B000GW8OAK|5.0|ITEM CAME IN PERFECT CONDITION AND THE SHIPPING WAS PRETTY FAST. I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS SELLER TO ANYONE.
1400082773|5.0|I have not finished reading the book, but I am very happy with what I have read so far. It gives some real personal input into his life and that is refreshing.    It is very well written.
0452289963|5.0|A New Earth is a deeply meaningful book and my spiritual path has not been this sparked since reading a number of Joseph Campbell's books (i.e. Reflections on the Art of Living). Like Campbell, Tolle points to the commonality of the world's religions, that they are metaphors for the same ultimate truth.  The book has an Eastern orientation; that God is both internal and external, and teaches how to cultivate an awareness of this by becoming present and stilling the mind (i.e. meditation).     This is not as woo-woo as you might think. The University of Mass. Medical School has a Stress Reduction Clinic based on these principles. Also, scientific research being done by the Mind & Life Institute shows how beneficial this is on both a physical and emotional level. Tolle's work goes far beyond spirituality. It points to a healthier, less stressful way of living and interacting in the world. My deepest gratitude goes to both Tolle and Oprah for sharing this with the world.
0786860707|5.0|Any artist - animator or otherwise, should read this book. It's not only about the craft of animation, but about the passion of pursuit in illustrating life accurately and in an engaging way.    Told from the perspective of two legends.    Highly recommended.
B000LXHK22|4.0|A GOOD YEAR will probably only be noted in cinematic history as the first time most Americans ever saw 2008 Oscar winner for Best Actress, Marion Cotillard.  Although Tim Burton's BIG FISH (in English) had previously offered Cotillard a small role, this is the first time US audiences really got the full shotgun impact of the actress's charm, playfulness, and startling beauty.  Ridley Scott allegedly told Cotillard that he had cast her opposite Oscar winner Russell Crowe because he felt she could \\"handle him,\\" by which he meant she could stand toe to toe with Crowe in scenes. (In his other films it's easy to see that Scott adores beautiful, intelligent and independent women.) This film didn't hit the mark with audiences or critics; that doesn't mean there's not some fine work going on here. Many viewers have said it's one of their favorite movies. A cheerful and engaging romantic comedy, A GOOD YEAR has some memorable moments, lush cinematography of France, and Marion Cotillard. That's surely worth a look on DVD.
1569242739|5.0|These recipes are great! I have only done the basics so far. Chocolate and vanilla, then I tried them with variation and made the cookies N cream and the lemon versions. There are many recipes in this book, then at the end of each recipe they give you variations. So fun! The frostings are great too! Closest to the \\"real\\" thing then any others I have tried. I made a batch of V & C for easter and they were a hit! Everyone was so impressed that they are better for you than traditional cupcakes and they taste amazing. I reccomend this book for all people. Vegan or not!
0694003611|5.0|I love reading this book to my daughter!  It is definitely a must-own children's book.
B000YABYLA|4.0|The dialouge is quick and witty, the characters are believable, and it's just downright funny.  The plot has a 16 year old girl pregnant after her first time having sex.  she decides to give it up to a loving couple, loving almost to the point where you feel Jennifer Garner might smother the kid as soon as she gets it.  All in all a good film, that got a lot of crap because it \\"glorifies teen pregnancy.\\"  Which by the way is a load of crap.  Watch this movie.
0805047905|5.0|This is my daughter's favorite book of all time.  I read it to her daily.  This is definitely a book that all children should have.  The colorful animals in the book are fun to look at, while the words are pleasant to read and listen to.  Very nice book!
B0002W18MU|5.0|I'm not going to pretend to be musically astute and theoretically compare how this album may have sounded if the Great JRC himself had been around to approve/disapprove the use of cellos in \\"Help Me.\\"    I'm going to tell you that when I thought \\"The Man Comes Around\\" would always be my favorite Cash album, it's only because this one hadn't been made yet.  Each and every cut touches my heart . . . comforts me, delights me, gives me courage.  (Yeah, even \\"Like the 309\\")     So, I'm gonna make this short and sweet.  Thank God, thank God and Rick Rubin for One More Cash.
0441013597|5.0|Dune...Arrakis...Desert Planet...    This is the best book of all time in my opinion. The level of complexity and that every bit of it is pertanent to the story. I'm not a fan of artsy fartsy ambiguous type stuff that to me seems like a cop-out to actual ideas. I have heard this book has received this label as well, and will agree it isnt an easy read. But everything, i mean everything that happens.. if you are paying attention is a reference point to another part of the book, and in some cases serise.     Well enough with that. In my opinion this book explores humanity and what it is to be human better than any other piece of art or literature I have ever read. Although at the beginning (as often times are observations in life) it seems easy to define who is good an evil. If you read this book and continue on you come to realize through amazingly human characters that people and ideals are very complicated.. good and evil is relative and no one is either. Paul is a product of much, as is the Barron, as are all other characters.     Dune may as well be a history book of the future.. it is as useful in exploring human nature. It even has a biblical.. its a messianic story that teaches, for those willing to absorb, an immense ammount about life, humanity, and the world around you. In my opinion (im an athiest) it is far more useful that the bible because it teaches empowerment as opposed to subsurvience.    One last note, and this will probably sound fake, but its not! When i read this, and all 5 other origional Dune books I was in jail, because I was a drug addict. I became obsessed with them and i credit them to where my life is today. I'm almost done with my bachelors degree with a 3.7gpa(in buisness administraction), sober, have an internship and a powerful private investment firm where im learning so much, and will be attending Graduate school next year.    i probably sound like a crazy person lol.. and no i dont think Paul Muad'Dib is my personal savior.. but ido think this book is a must read!
B00003CXBK|5.0|I didn't think I was going to like this lesser known Miyazaki film. I don't know what was wrong with me - I've liked all his others. \\"Spirited Away\\" is my favorite of his more popular movies.  This story didn't look anything like that.<br /><br />And it's not. This story is about the struggle of nature against human civilization, and man against animal, animal against man. Its message is very real today.<br /><br />Beside the underlying story, what really had me taken was the thought put into this tale - all these interesting things you might never think of. A  young girl raised by wolves (and she rides them!), and animal \\"bosses\\" or elders that are enormous compared to their followers (reminds me of typical video games where the boss is huge). The art was beautiful, just beautiful.<br /><br />I've got the urge to watch this movie again, just to \\"live\\" in that world for a couple of hours once more.
B000PFUAO6|5.0|I did go through the reviews, but as for me being an ardent DT fan, this album is a 'killer 2' album after 'Train of thought' killer 1 album...very dark...I love the song called 'Ministry of lost souls', which is so rich in percussive progressive guitar chops. The voice mix of Corey and Mikael is simply stunning on the track 'Repentance'. I believe DT still strongly live up and survive to their progressive ethics.
0312995423|1.0|This is a piece of absolute trash.  Dan Brown's writing skills are exceedingly limited, but at least Angels and Demons, and Da Vinci made a modicum of sense.  Digital Fortress is a trackless waste that starts nowhere and goes nowhere.  Save your money!!!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I must begin by saying that I saw Sweeney with the original cast on Broadway in 1979. I was 14 years old...thanks Mom and Dad for being so progressive!! This musical (and Sondheim) has been my favorite ever since.  Anyway I did have certain preconceived notions about this when I heard it was being made into a movie by Tim Burton. I used to really love Burton, but lately well, not so much. I had visions of Goldberg-esge staging and typical Burton visuals. Burton can't seem to let go of pale-faced dark-eyed make-up, and bit of machinery-gear-type props, but otherwise, he did a great job getting away from this.<br /><br />I am not going to tell the entire plot because (to quote Sondeim): \\"what happens then, well that's the play and he wouldn't want us to give it away...not Sweeney...\\"<br /><br />Anyway, I bought this and actually hesitated for a week before watching it. I was afraid my great experiences with the story would be forever tainted. But, nevertheless, I began. I heard the overture during the opening credits and was very excited that it was performed with an orchestra and lush arrangement (rather than electric guitars or something.) I saw the opening scene (missing the opening ensemble song) and braced myself for Depp's singing. However, when I heard Depp begin, I was pleasantly surprised. See, my first experience with Sweeney was Len Cariou. He played it similarly to Depp. He was not so much over the top, evil-incarnate; but more quiet, vengeful, sorrowful, and wronged. Cariou is also on the original cast-recording, which is available here on Amazon ([[ASIN:B0009941IE Sweeney Todd, the Demon Barber of Fleet Street (1979 Original Broadway Cast)]] and very good!) The DVD I have of the stage-production ([[ASIN:B00005JL6V Sweeney Todd - The Demon Barber of Fleet Street (Broadway) (Snap Case)]]) stars George Hearn who plays the part a little harder, a little angrier. I prefer the softer, more pitiful Sweeney; the villian needs to show a real motivation, Depp makes him real. This works with the score as the music isn't violent-crazy. It has more of an undercurrent of \\"something is going to happen\\"or \\"someone peering around the corner.\\" A thriller--not a slasher.  Cariou's voice and body were more large and haunting than Depp's, but for the feeling itself, Depp seems to have captured it.<br /><br />Helena Bonham Carter has taken the Angela Lansbury role of Mrs. Lovett. Well, any theater fan knows these are huge shoes to fill. She tries, her voice isn't bad, it just is so diminutive. Mrs. Lovett is not a diminutive character! If you haven't heard it, you must listen to \\"the Worst Pies in London\\" by Lansbury. She is fantastic; she nearly steals the show with this song alone; no comparison to Carter. Carter does seem to come alive more as the film continues, plays her version of Lovett well, and does have a nice devious-ness to her! Her interpretation of the character, indeed makes you look at her a different, but effective way. Johanna's song (though shorter) is wonderfully performed  in this version. I actually loved the orginal singer, but it was quite operatic; this portrayal was much more accessible. Anthony is also very good in the movie version (played by Jamie Campbell Bower.) Compared to original cast, he seemed younger and very appropriate for the naive, young-lover character. Pirelli (Baron-Coen) is also surprizingly good in the film. Great casting jobs all around.<br /><br />I am not sure why they changed Lucy's role to not-quite-as-crazy. Toby was also less \\"witted\\" in the stage version, this one was just younger. Maybe not PC anymore to have a mentally-challenged stereotyped character (which isn't a bad thing.) Judge Turpin and the Beadle's roles were slightly different in the stage version (they had a wonderful duet!), but Rickman indeed plays a convincing antagonist (I will always associate him fondly with the movie \\"Die Hard.\\")<br /><br />They did a great job with the \\"A little Priest\\" even though the switch tocomic-relief is a little more effective in a live performance (you get to hear the audience laughing.) There is wonderful orchestration throughout the whole movie, I am so happy they didn't try to reduce it to a bunch of some pop songs and or add some new Top-40 ballad. I do miss the workers' whistle and I sorely miss my favorite ensemble...\\"Attend the tale of sweeney todd, his skin was pale and his eye was odd...\\" but understand why it probably would not work in the movie. I would have liked to hear it over the end credits.<br /><br />I understand that this is not a movie-version of the stage play, it is a movie ~based~ on the the theater play. Still, it is quite similar and it is interesting to compare and appreciate the differences in the two versions. If you have never seen the stage-version or listened to the original cast recording; you owe it to yourself to buy or rent them. If you have never heard of Sweeney Todd before this film, I think you will enjoy this version of the dark tale.<br /><br />I like the 2-disk set as it contains (besides the feature film) interviews with Sondheim, \\"making of\\" feature, history of the story, special effects discussion, and info on the original stage productions.<br /><br />Burton has completely redeemed himself for me with this film. I hope that maybe some folks who think live-theater is not for them, will (after viewing this DVD) give it another chance and raise expectations of its future (I think we have had enough Disney-movie re-hashings, just my opinion.)<br /><br />Sorry this got long, but I really love the musical, and was a doubter about the film. I hoped I could convice others to give it a chance. I gave the film 5 stars out of 5 because they stayed true to the story and the music, for how they reimagined the play for film, but mostly for Depp's surprisingly fine performance.

B000ZK4466|5.0|The Mars Volta are not just one of the most exciting bands to come about since the turn of the millennium, they truly show a new type of music, with intensity and focus not found in modern music since the days of Led Zeppelin. Guided by the eccentric yet brilliant duo of Cedric Bixler-Zavala and Omar Rodriguez-Lopez, The Bedlam in Goliath is their heaviest and most complex work to date.     Exploding out of the gates is Aberinkula, a pounding song with trademark Volta tricks, such as sudden changes, amazing solos, and intricate timing. This immediately transitions into Metatron, (meaning the voice of god, yes we've all seen Dogma). The first half of the album (Aberinkula to Goliath) is hard charging and intense. Every song is a standout, and they build upon each other until reaching the amazing climax at the end of Goliath.    The album then gives you your one and only chance to breathe, with Tourniquet Man. This song gets a lot of flack for being half-baked and sloppy. This, however, is all by design, as this track sets the tense mood that is explored through out the rest of the album.    But before we get to the second half of this amazing album, a bit of back story is needed. This album tells the story of Omar and Co.'s experiences with a Ouija-esqe board he bought from a bazaar in Jerusalem. This board let them communicate to various spirits, one of which called itself Goliath. This spirit shared its story with the band, and they were progressively mesmerized by the magic device. But as Goliath and the Volta because closer, strange things began happening to the band and people around them, such as their producer having a nervous break down, losing 3 drummers (Jon Theodore, Blake Flemming, and Deantoni Parks) before finding the phenomenal Thomas Pridgen, the master tapes of the first recording of this album were lost, and various other things happened to impede the production of the album. Simultaneously, Goliath began to become more agitated and demanding of theband, eventually threatening their lives. Omar and Cedric decided that a curse had been placed upon them by Goliath and they must get rid of this soothsayer before anything else bad happens. Omar ritualistically buried it somewhere, and Cedric asked to not be told where it was buried, in fear of him feeling it would call to him.     The Bedlam in Goliath (Bedlam meaning a Place, Scene or State of uproar and confusion) is based upon this time in the band's life and gives us, the listeners, some of the most chaotic, melodic, and beautiful music ever recorded.     The second half of this album (from Cavelatas to Conjugal Burns) gets more complex and astounding. Every song is a standout, and when Cedric is wailing \\"Calling me...its calling me\\" during Soothsayer, you feel an all too real chill crawl up your spine. Conjugal Burns makes you feel like Goliath was finally defeated and everything may end up ok...until the song plays a mad trick on you and you realize that nothing was defeated...    Sure its a bit heady and you really have to have an open mind about music while listening to this album...but then again, if you know the Volta, you know that they will challenge you, but ultimately you will be rewarded with the best music you've ever heard. If you have never heard of The Mars Volta, you would probably be better to start our with a more accessible album, either De-Loused in the Comatorium, or Amputechture.    The best part of this album is that once you listen to it, it almost sounds like something you've heard before...something you've always known, and the Volta just reveals it to you in a way you didn't think about. Its loud, its intense, and its sometimes unpleasant, but this album shows how The Mars Volta are truly doing something novel in music, and they should be respected and adored by everyone.
0451450523|5.0|I grew up watching the movie, and I was delighted to discover the book.    The book has a lot on common with the movie, but is also very different in tone in a lot of places -- much more humorous, satiric, parodic.  But still beautiful.    Peter Beagle can't really be compared to any other author -- people who write negative reviews of TLU seem to have been expecting something different, more of a standard fantasy, or something like LOTR.  (Don't get me wrong -- I love LOTR.  But just because it's fantasty and TLU is fantasy doesn't mean the two are going to be anything alike.)  The only other author I can think to compare Peter Beagle to at all might be John Crowley.  Very unique, moves at his own pace, has a very distinct style (of writing and of plotting and characterization).  If you love him, you love him, and if you don't like him, well then, you don't.
B001437DMA|5.0|From the first moment I listened to this album, I absolutely loved it. Being a big fan of intrumental rock, I have all of Joe's albums. I can say that this album is the best album he ever did. In fact every album is better than the one he's done before. I can't think of anybody else who can pull this off. I think he wouldn't do a new one if he thought he cannot top the previous one. And by improving I don't mean improving his play, I think there is little to be done on that side. It is just better and better music. His songwriting, which has always set him apart from everybody else, has reached new levels on this album. The first two songs are Satch at his best. \\"Asik Vaysel\\" who was a Turkish homeless poet, musician and who lived at the beginning of last century, is even little known in Turkey. He could not read or write and there is little to be found about him. It is amazing how Joe has managed to hear of him and use some of his tunes on the song he has named after \\"Asik Vaysel\\", which translated from Turkish means \\"Vaysel in Love\\". I think this song is one of the highlights of this album. Five stars for the greatest guitar virtuose ever.

037571457X|4.0|Please take the time to read this striking memoir and its sequel, Persepolis 2. The language is straightforward, as is the graphic style. Satrapi's very personal story speaks to both the difficulties of living in a straight-laced, dogmatically rigid society, and the many different stories and perspectives of those who live there. Iran is often portrayed in a reductionist manner in the West, and a close reading of these books serves to broaden and deepen our understanding.    Additionally, Satrapi is currently near the end of a speaking tour in the U.S. IF you have the opportunity to hear her speak, take advantage of it. She is a cogent and compassionate speaker who will further deepen your understanding of the Iranian people.
0143038419|1.0|I was referred this book by a friend, and looking at the premise I thought it would be up my alley. I mean, what woman doesn't like a life affirming spiritual book with some hot tea on a chilly winter day? Well, maybe not EVERY woman, but I personally do. This book looked like it could meet that requirement, however upon reading chapter one I was completely disappointed.  Reading just the beginning about WHY she left her husband, her complete cowardice in handling the situation, and the vomit inducing rhetoric which I can only assume the author was trying to be cute about made me just want to trash the book on a number of occasions. It was just drivel - whoa is me - sort of anti-feminism thoughts with no real strong character to pull it together.<br /><br />Gilbert seems to be a decent writer, but the way she conveys thoughts, feelings, and her viewpoint on life is just outright sad. There's no better way to put it. And it is almost as though she has taken all her pathetic rationales as to what led her on her not so great journey and cherry picked the most ridiculous and non-thought provoking ideas and put them in a book.<br /><br />Thankfully for her, her publisher bound it up in this chic, hip looking cover with a catchy little title, which is apparently is appealing to the masses. Sadly this little cover is the only interesting thing in the book.
B00008QSA5|4.0|I first bought Super Session (and its semi-sequel \\"The Live Adventures\\") on vinyl at a garage sale for $1, primarily after reading Al Kooper's book \\"Backstage Passes and Backstabbing Bastards\\" detailing the sessions. After 1-2 plays of each I found myself saying \\"I bought these because...?\\" Don't get me wrong, each is full of well played music, but the legend of these albums seems to have overtaken the facts. So years later when I bought the CD's (for whatever reason) I was saying the same things. But a funny thing happened, Super Session seemed to grow on me. And it found a regular place in my bag of CD's (no Ipod just yet). The more you listen, the more you find yourself getting into the groove of the music within.     Super Session was the brainchild of producer Al Kooper. Having been kicked out of Blood Sweat & Tears, frustrated in his job as a staff producer at CBS Records, and without enough material for a solo album he hit upon an idea that had been a mainstay of jazz players. Gather a group of like-minded musicians together and jam on whatever songs were available for a quickie album. But this had never been tried in a rock context. And Kooper was eager to show what his friend Michael Bloomfield was capable of. Bloomfield had been kicked out of his own band Electric Flag, and was game for the idea. They added bassist Harvey Brooks and drummer Eddie Hoh to complete the band, then started recording in California. They knocked off 5 songs the first day and Kooper thought this would be easy. Until the next day when he got a phone call asking if Michael had made his plane home. Bloomfield had left, citing chronic insomnia. Kooper desperately contacted every guitarist he could think of, eventually getting a commitment from another musical orphan, Stephen Stills. Stills' band Buffalo Springfield had just split up and he was a year away from forming CSN.     Super Session was an unlikely success when first released in 1968. No hit singles came from it. Each member of the \\"band\\" remains (except for Stills) a trivia question. Its musical structure starts as hard-edged Chicago blues (courtesy of Bloomfield) then veers in country rock and psychedelics (via Stills & Kooper). And yet it hit #11 on the album charts and became a fixture on underground FM stations that year. Bloomfield turns in some stinging blues on the opener \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" and on \\"Really\\".     The 2nd half belongs to Stills and Kooper as they mix it up on covers of Dylan's \\"It Takes a Lot to Laugh, It Takes a Train to Cry\\", Donovan's \\"Season of the Witch\\". And the blues standard \\"You Don't Love Me\\" gets the phased guitar sound here. (Compare this to the Allman Brothers version on \\"Live at the Fillmore\\"). You can clearly hear Stills' Buffalo Springfield guitar sound here as well as the beginnings of the sound he had later with CSN. In Kooper's book he says that \\"Stills had just gotten his first set of Marshall amps and was chompin' at the bit to blast his Les Paul through 'em\\".     The expanded version of this album adds 4 songs. 2 are alternate mixes of \\"Albert's Shuffle\\" and \\"Season of the Witch\\" that eliminate the horn sections. A live cut called \\"Fat Grey Cloud\\" comes from a 1968 Fillmore West show. And an unreleased instrumental \\"Blues for Nothing\\" that sounds like an alternate \\"Albert's\\".    The legend of this album continued with the \\"Live Adventures\\" album a year later (Bloomfield left again after playing on half this album too) and with the more recently released \\"Lost Fillmore Show\\" disc (which is a complete Kooper/Bloomfield show adding an then-unknown Johnny Winter as a special guest ).    Like I said, this album grows on you. It comes from a time we won't see again when musicians with nothing to lose just met to play and see what might happen.
B000XTLUW0|5.0|This is an absolutely fantastic set. Muse sounds great live, maybe even better than the studio recordings. The song sets are both long and diverse, from old to new. The camera work is the best I have ever seen in a concert DVD, the audio is clear and sounds good, and the video looks great. If you couldn't have been there in person, this is your best option, and after watching it, you just might feel like you had been there.
B0016679JW|3.0|My review of [U]Accelerate[/U]: There's six great rockers--\\"Living Well...\\" \\"Man-Sized Wreath\\" \\"Supernatural Superserious\\" \\"Accelerate\\" \\"Horse To Water\\" \\"I'm Gonna DJ\\" and the remaining 5 should have been saved for the legendary-some-day-we-might-even-beat-Neil-Young-to-the-punch boxed set. Probably the best R.E.M. product since [U]New Adventures[/U]. Don't like the drums buried in the mix on the album, and the overall \\"muffled\\" production, but that's a personal thing. Your mileage may vary. If you like the I.R.S. Years, you'll probably enjoy this release a lot. Recommended repeated listenings. Sounds the best on a cheap stereo or boombox. Maybe that was their intention. Too bad \\"Red Head Walking\\" and \\"Airliner\\" were regulated to b-sides.......either/both are much better than some of the filler that was selected for the album. 6/11.
B0013FXWU6|4.0|Upton Sinclair's epic novel OIL! has been successfully transformed to a film by screen writer/director Paul Thomas Anderson ('Magnolia','Boogie Nights', etc). The film is a long song (158 minutes), covering a fascinating span of time in turn of the century California when oil gained the lure of gold and transformed the land and the people into creatures of capitalism and greed and lust, and were it not for the presence of Daniel Day-Lewis' powerful performance as the man who makes it all happen, the story itself would become tiresome.  It doesn't.<br /><br />Daniel Plainview (Daniel Day-Lewis) is a silver miner in 1898, but soon discovers oil and begins on a mission to become wealthy, owning most of the oil fields from the mountains of central California to the Pacific Ocean. With his medicine man manner of getting people to do what he wants he pursues his greed relentlessly, disrupting small sleepy towns like Little Boston as he gains access to the wealth of the black gold.  There are odd characters along the way, such as the evangelist Eli Sunday (Paul Dano) who become crushable clods beneath Plainview's boots. The progress of the story is well known to most: it is the telling of the tale in the hands of wholly credible, completely physically immersed Daniel Day-Lewis that makes the story seem new.<br /><br />The film's grimy atmosphere is well presented in Robert Elswit's cinematography and the odd musical score by Jonny Greenwood is as ominous as the vantage of Plainview. Greenwood elects to weave classical works into the fabric of the film: when young HW falls deaf after an explosion the silence is partnered by one of Arv&ouml; P&auml;rt's 'Fratres', and the film's credits are displayed over the Anne-Sophie Mutter/von Karajan recording of Brahms' Violin Concerto. Strange bedfellows, yes, but entirely appropriate to the overall mood of the film. The journey is long and depressing, but the power of Day-Lewis' performance is magic.  Grady Harp, April 08
B00005JKL8|5.0|I enjoyed this movie quite a lot. It's basically about what the title says--being left behind enemy lines.     I'm sorry, I don't believe in spoilers too much, so I'm quite limited to what I can say about this. But if you like war movies (or just action movies, since technically the plot is supposed to be during a time of peace or at least a truce), you will most likely enjoy this movie.
B000002JSJ|4.0|Presence is Led Zep's overlooked, underrated, and often hated album. Why? Because of such heavy funk as 'Candy Store Rock' and 'Royal Orleans', not to mention the fact that people argue whether 'Achilles Last Stand' and 'For Your Life' are good or not. My answer to all this is: take the time to listen to the album and listen to it full volume! The album seems to be all about volume and you could hear where the energy is coming from.     First there's 'Achilles Last Stand', a ten minute + epic that only Led Zep could pull off at a time when punk was starting to dominate the scene. People often complain about \\"how long it is\\", and that it could have been \\"shortened to three minutes\\". But here's the thing: there was no possible way of doing that. They had to make it ten minutes  because it wouldn't have built up enough to mean anything otherwise. Sure they've done 3 minute epics before like 'Black Dog' and 'Immigrant Song', but 'Achilles' needed more time for it to build up into something special. We have the two solos, Plant's vocals mimicking Page's guitar, and the lyrics, all of these had to be incorporated into the song because this song defines what Led Zeppelin were all about. That's why it's ten minutes. This song deserves a 10 out 5.      As the opening track one expects the rest of the album to be as epic, but under the circumstances in which the album was recorded, the boys just seemed to tire out.      'For Your Life' at first seemed to be a filler going nowhere, but when the second riff comes along, this songs kicks you right in the face. For the rest of the song the energy is felt and the song is extremely exciting. 5 out of 5.    'Royal Orleans' is the first song on here to showcase the 'pseudo funk' that Zep plays in songs like 'Hots On For Nowhere', and 'Candy Store Rock'. These songs are ugly, no doubt, but the energy is somewhat exciting. But this is Led Zep we're talking about. What the hell are they doing making pseudo funk songs? And for that to bemost of the album? What bugs me the most about these songs is that it seemed like Led Zep were trying too hard to come up with something, but they ran out of ideas.  This is why this album is looked upon in such a bad light. Granted 'Royal Orleans' may be the worse song on the album (and maybe even the entire Zeppelin catalog), but the song is STILL interesting even tough it's bad. Must be the energy. 2 out of 5.     'Hots On' is pretty bad, and that song doesn't even have energy, but it's not as ugly and clumsy as 'Royal'. 3 out of 5.     'Candy Store Rock' is the best one out of the three, with Plant mimicking Elvis, it's kind of funny. The song is still below the Zep standard though. 3.5 out of 5.    That being said, 'Nobody's Fault But Mine' is excellent. This song is said to be about Page's heroin addiction and it is a strong confession. The start-stop structure and Plant's vocals work so well together here, not to mention that distorted harmonica solo! The drums are immense and the energy is massive. When Plant stutters his lines it's as if he's on heroin himself. 5 out of 5.     Then there's 'Tea For One'. Sure it's a rewrite of 'Since I've Been Loving You', but it is slower and more sophisticated, it seems like. I love the way Plant sings this one, it's very heartfelt. The song is a great closer for the album too.  5 out of 5.         So yeah, most of the album is great. Sure its not as good as the untitled album or Physical Graffiti. The album is small, often times feels empty (no keyboards found in the album at all), but Presence seems to have a style of its own. Presence is a good 4 out of 5 in my book.
B00008RWRH|5.0|I'm prompted to write this review by our Haydn fan:    There's a story about Brahms listening to a performance of his first piano concerto, turning to his friend sitting next to him and saying, \\"You can play it that way, too.\\"  Most of us would never think that one conductor would reveal everything there is to reveal in a Beethoven or Mozart symphony; why would we think differently about Haydn?    Haydn's late symphonies are immensely sane and optimistic, unfailingly inventive, full of contrasts and surprises, bold and daring, and multi-dimensional emotionally.  In other words, they are just as complex as the more obviously complex symphonies of the romantic era, despite their seemingly placid surfaces; they are just more subtle.      My standard for \\"great\\" performances are ones that communicate emotionally, hold together structurally, and tell me something new about the piece.  Jochum's performances of the \\"Salomon\\" symphonies are amongst that group.  Jochum clearly loves this music, and his love comes through in every bar.  These are genial, warm, robust performances, recorded live by DGG in a London concert series.  A photo of the orchestra in rehearsal with Jochum shows a slimmed-down version of the London Philharmonic, so textures are relatively transparent.  Tempi are brisk in general, but never rushed and without the waywardness that could creep into Jochum's performances of romantic composers.  Everything feels judiciously considered and spontaneously rendered.  Jochum apparently wanted to record these symphonies with an English orchestra, and the London Philharmonic has that \\"English\\" sound, with slightly nasal woodwinds, smooth but lean strings, and somewhat brash brass.  The sound is DGG's early-70's analog stereo at its best: detailed and warm, with great hall ambience.  The cd transfers, not surprisingly, are excellent.    Should this be your only set of these symphonies?  No.  There is much to learn from Beecham, Bernstein, Scherchen and Szell, amongst others, and amongst the newer generation, Thomas Fey, whose series of Haydn symphonies is generating alot of interest.  Music this complex and this good deserves to be heard several ways; as Brahms would have said, \\"You can perform it that way, too!\\"
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|When this movie was released in theaters in 1979/1980, it was considered to be \\"John Carpenter's worst mistake\\", but today, it is considered as a total horror classic !<br /><br />I don't know what people where thinking back in the 80's when they said this movie was terrible, I mean, from the first moment I saw it, I totally liked it and it scared the hell out of me !<br /><br />I was something about 7 or 8 years old when I first saw it, it scared me a lot, but let me tell you right now I'm 19, almost 20, and it still scares me so much, you never get bored of watching it, specially if it is in a cold, rainy weather at night, besides, the atmosphere of this movie is so great, it has that carpenter's style of horror from Halloween, Halloween 2, and possibly Halloween 3.<br />Go ahead and watch \\"The fog\\" ! !<br /><br />Greetings!
B000ZN8036|5.0|This movie was truely remarkable. Of course every movie or even book calls out to us, this movie called out to me. Perhaps sometimes in life we get to learn the lessons of life through another. Supertramp finds out that happiness is only real if it it shared. This may seem obvious to some but for others they must find out for themselves.
B000002BBY|5.0|Morning Glory is Oasis's best album, and one of my favorites.  All the tracks are great, from Hello to Champagne Supernova.  Every song is perfect Britpop, with Liam's bratty voice going perfectly with the rest of the band's instruments.  The hits Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, and Champagne Supernova are all beautiful songs, and the seven other songs sound very similar to them.  All the songs have great lyrics sung suberbly by Liam and Noel, and great guitar parts by the band.  Every song has a beautiful chorus' like Wonderwall, Don't Look Back In Anger, Some Might Say, She's Electric, Morning Glory, and Champagne Supernova.  This album is a must-have for all ruck n' rull fans, old-school fans, and even pop and punk fans.
B0002I831S|5.0|I bought these to watch with my twelve year old son-\\"The Next Generation\\".  He had never seen any Star Trek series and now he is in love with the original.  They are better than I remember them.  I last watched them in college on a small black and white set, to watch them on a large color sceen makes them better.  Although a little dated, especially the special effects, they were still great stories and to watch and hear the dialogue between Kirk, Spock, and McCoy again is quite a treat.

B000E6UK5K|4.0|Many people will be familiar with the relaxed, zen state that can infuse a listener when listening to some of the classic Pink Floyd tracks. Those that enjoyed that sensation will be pleased by David Gilmour's suitably named offering 'On An Island'.    Even many years after the split of Floyd, Gilmour still puts together quality music with consumate ease. Opening with the classic, howling, solitary guitar in 'Castellorizon', before moving on to the wailing sax of 'Red Sky At Night' that will remind seasoned listeners of a fusion of 'Wish You Were Here' and 'Ummagumma'. 'This Heaven' has a more gruff, jazz house feel and wrenches the album away from it's more mellowed out tones before dropping it gently back down into 'Then I Close My Eyes'.    It will be heartening for fans after so many years, that much of the original magic still remains. Many fans were disappointed with some of the final Floyd offerings. Maybe there is something here that was missing from their last releases.
0452289963|4.0|Eckhart Tolle presents some highly significant insights, but because he has an inadequate map of the psyche, he makes things more obscure than they need to be.      He discusses consciousness or awareness at considerable length, but he does not pinpoint the precise functions of consciousness, which are twofold. First, consciousness receives input from the senses, mind, emotions, instincts, fantasies, intuitions, etc. Second, consciousness chooses what to do with that input: consciousness is the decider. Tolle doesn't deal with this second aspect at all. He believes that if you just pay attention to the present, you can gain some distance from the inputs. I accept that he awakened in this manner, and I grant that paying attention to the present moment can be very deep and very holy. But for most of us, unless you understand the map, you're likely to end up fighting with yourself.      Tolle makes bogeymen out of the ego and what he calls the \\"painbody,\\" and this is a serious mistake. He says that our egos are identifications with our roles or programs that tell us how to act, with what he calls the \\"world of form.\\" It is true that our consciousness is sometimes or in some ways run by our roles or programs if we identify with them, but most of the time we are at least partly conscious, choosing how to act. All we have to do to become awakened is realize that  consciousness does not have to identify with any of its inputs, even those which may be tuning us in to the present moment. It is good to recognize that \\"I am consciousness.\\" Everything else is secondary, and is not \\"I.\\" Then we can strengthen consciousness' ability to evaluate and act on the inputs, and separation from the inputs is achieved.      Tolle lumps all our negative dysfunctional programs together into the painbody, and tells us how subtle and crafty the painbody can be. This is simply giving those dysfunctional programs an extra boost of energy, inviting them to band together and attack us, when whatwe should be doing is draining all the energy out of them and replacing them with more functional programs. Dealing with a particular dysfunctional program is much simpler than blaming the painbody for our negativity. Contrary to his assertion, we do not have a part of ourselves that seeks negative experiences, that \\"feeds on negativity,\\" altho I suppose you can create a painbody for yourself if you want one. We simply have individual dysfunctional programs that we designed ourselves, usually in early childhood, when we weren't clear what our values and objectives are.     Awakening is not just a matter of tuning in to the present moment. Meditating with an appropriate psychedelic can give you all the tuning in to the present moment you could possibly ask for, altho that is a course I am not recommending. No. Awakening is a matter of choosing positive values, choosing to walk the path of love in all ways. It helps to recognize that we are all parts of God, and it most certainly helps to be attentive. Tolle says nothing about choosing the positive values, probably because it's too obvious for him. So this book and Oprah's classes go a ways in the right direction, but we really need an accurate map of the territory to understand where we are and what we need to do. Let us awaken!
B00132D808|5.0|To tell you the truth, when I heard what kind of album this was going to be, I was a little afraid. Having been madly in love with Panic's first album, I'm not too sure what I was hoping for, whether it be new songs in the same type of layout as their first album (As Linkin Park's Hybrid Theory and Meteora were....... Meteora might as well have been \\"Hybrid Theory 2: A Trip Back To The Same Old S***\\") Don't get me wrong, I love Linkin Park, but this review is about Panic, not Linkin Park. Back to the subject, if there's one thing I've always loved it's when everything you here in a song is done by real instruments. That's just what Panic here did, everything was authentic. Brilliant touch. In short, the album sounds nothing like their first, but I'm madly in love with this one too.  Just pure awesome album. 5 stars for sure. I'd like to see someone try and say they sound like Fall Out Boy now. (Love Fall Out Boy too for people's info.)
B001437DMA|4.0|Joe Satriani has been a hero of mine since I heard \\"Surfing With The Alien\\" and was simply blown away....I had no idea you could play like that. Joe was pretty much my hero growing up and learning to play guitar, much like Hendrix was his inspiration. I have subsequently picked up everything the man has released, and have never been disappointed.<br /><br />This album displays all of the elements of his unique style, including his virtuoso soloing and complexity (\\"Musterion\\" and \\"Overdriver\\"), melodic ballads (\\"Come On Baby\\" and \\"Out Of The Sunrise\\"), and his trademark soaring melodicism (\\"Revelation\\"). Although Joe might never go as \\"over-the-top\\" as he used to in the eighties, he remains a superbly talented musician and incredible player who singehandedly popularized instrumental rock music and inspired millions of players (inlcuding myself). After all these years, the man still tears it up and creates amazing and beautiful music that doesn't sound like anyone else. Recommended!
0618918248|4.0|[[ASIN:0618918248 The God Delusion]]  Richard Dawkins has written an intelligent, cogent argument for not believing in a deity.  Prof. Dawkins is a scientist and he presents  his evidence clearly and logically.  The book is not as entertaining  as \\"God is not Great\\" by Christopher Hitchens, which came out about the  same time, with the same argument,  but Dawkins is a good writer, and I found the book compelling and interesting.
B00008BXJF|4.0|Over a span of around thirty years, Robert Fripp has served as the talented mad genius around which the various other (equally talented) members orbit; producing avant-garde progressive musical statements which are often difficult to describe (and occasionally difficult to listen to), much less categorize. \\"The Power To Believe\\" continues in that tradition, while taking a step closer, perhaps, to a more modern prog-rock sound.<br /><br />For those new to King Crimson, this is as good a place as any to start. King Crimson albums are loosely-conceptually themed progressive and experimental rock epics with complex and at times dissonant instrumentation and percussion, subversive and intelligent lyrics and an often satirical, sardonic black sense of humor on display. The lyrics of \\"Happy With What You Have To Be Happy With\\", for example, are an amusing and sarcastic inditement of the music industry...rounding out the package is some excellent and somewhat disturbing artwork and packaging and an equally excellent production. Crimson were extremely influential progenitors of the modern avant-garde/post-rock music scene. For old fans, this album lies somewhere between \\"Discipline\\" and \\"The Construktion Of Light\\", although purists fond of the older Crimson (\\"Court Of The Crimson King\\", \\"Red\\", etc.) might not like the more contemporary-sounding production and tone. Recommended.
0192838679|5.0|I think it was Kierkegaard who advised to be aware of entangling alliances. The web of sin in this book is masterfully woven as letters to frame-up an epistolary novel in which each character's letters speak volumes about the characters themselves. The novel was written in the same period as Rousseau in the Napoleonic era, when the novel as a genre was relatively young. Valmont is the penultimate anti-hero and knave who finds decadent pleasure in conquering, as if it were a military campaign, and then abandoning beautiful, prominent women in high society. His cohort the Marquise de Merteuil must be considered one of the great fiends of this new genre, who earns her just rewards. It's fascinating to witness the noose tightening in the exchange of letters among the characters. The dialogue about the nature of love is beautifully articulated in many places, where it is sincere. \\"And love: does one have it when one wills? Yet one needs it ever.\\" Or \\"Teach me to live where you are not.\\" So often in this novel love is a high-stakes game played for the perverse joy engendered by the spectacle of the demise of one of the lovers. This is a one of a kind epistolary novel worthy of the acclaim it has received over the centuries for its engaging story line as a morality tale told in the decadent high society of France in the time of Napoleon.
B00000DGSN|5.0|With The Band's \\"Rock of Ages\\" and The Allman Brothers \\"At Fillmore East\\" double live albums, it's only fitting to capture another stellar live band in their prime. DP was hitting their peak with the lineup that made them legendary (known as the Mk II lineup). With the success of their biggest selling album \\"Machine Head\\", the boys embarked on an extensive tour culminating with these performances in Japan.    The octane level of these performances is simply immeasurable. No slouchers here at all! Blackmore's guitar just pierces right through your ear. Lord's Hammond organ gives so much weight to the sound, it'll knock your feet off the floor. Glover's bass playing matches both of them easily. As a drummer myself, Paice has always been the bee's-knees for me with his fast and powerful execution. And Gillan's voice just soars to the stratosphere.    This was a time when Rock bands actually played live and NOT just simply duplicate the studio versions of the songs like they do today. Almost all the songs here are extended to double, triple and even five times the length of their studio counterparts! This type of musicianship is getting more scarce than ever today.    I'm not going to go over all the cuts here but highlights are: The opener Highway Star that just doesn't let up. Paice's drum solo on The Mule. Lord's opening Hammond segment on Lazy making you think it's Jimi on keyboards. Gillan and Blackmore's voice/guitar exchange on Strange Kind of Woman and the 20 min. workout on Space Truckin'. And with the newly added bonus tracks of Speed King, Lucille and their earlier hit Black Night, we now have a more complete concert.    MIJ certainly ranks with the previous said albums along with The Who's \\"Live at Leeds\\", Yes' \\"Yessongs\\", ELP's \\"Welcome Back...\\", King Crimson's \\"USA\\", Little Feat's \\"Waiting for Colombus\\" and the countless Grateful Dead live albums. Now if the mindless punks of today would just pay attention to this!

B000JLTRIQ|5.0|This movie is awsome, I am a big fan of Nick Cage  and he played a good part in this movie.
0307387178|4.0|The prolonged and intense self-inquiry (aka soul-searching) that occurs in many people about their existence, has, most probably, its seed in a very early and deep level of deprivation or rejection/betrayal of the self/soul by the very entities that were meant to protect it. It could be a lack of nurture, truth and the like.    So this 22 yr old young man in the book (a major film now) abandoned the comfort and predictability of a modern life in the USA and went into the wilderness in Alaska. And the story captures the details of what led him to this act, this adventure, and how he touched people along the way..    For me, this book had a lot of poignancy in depicting something which can be considered naive and adolescent... McCandless was an intense and intelligent man, so he needed the truth of his existence ( I won't give away the suspense in my review) and he searched for it, in an intense way because that was his style. He stayed true to what he wanted and what he wanted to believe...    The were many powerful moments in the book where I was gripped by an anticipation of something remarkable and unthinkable happening to change the course of events, so McCandless could be saved....because any reader who has ever had the \\"time\\" to challenge themselves or their beliefs, would've felt like McCandless and can relate to what he went through, to some extent..    The most powerful part for me was when he realised that \\"happiness is real when it's shared\\"....that sums up the loneliness and isolation McCandless felt in the middle of nowhere and craved for food, love and human contact...     I would strongly recommend this book to all readers who want to learn about this young man, who actually lived, a very short life, and tried to make sense of it in his own way. This is no fiction. It's now made into a film. Sean Penn is a great director who will only get better and better with each of his attempts, Eddie Vedder's original score just adds that special meaningful touchto every scene.
B0010X73ZG|5.0|This film has not sat well with me. That's a good thing. To like this film I needed it to be controversial. It was that, in spades. Without giving anything away I will say the ending was sad, and somewhat unexpected. It's not that I couldn't see the ending coming if I'd just tried harder to get out of the director's plot, but that's what made the film so riveting. It's a horror story that showcases the fallibility of people, they're lack of faith when the rug's pulled out from under them. Those claiming to have stronger faith turned out to be the ones with the least, capitulating to their fear and clinging to any straw to grasp that was presented.  The sad ending was a noble but ultimately futile and tragic gesture for those with the wits and courage to take a chance.   So, I hate this movie's ending but still find it not only appropriate but it changed my mind about things I was taught since i was a young man, about personal sacrifice and the nature of mercy.  I hope I remember this lesson.     ...just in case......
B000P12LWY|3.0|As many other reviewers have stated, this is not a documentary and should bear the statement \\"any resemblance to individuals living or dead is purely coincidental\\". Yes, there is a king named Henry VIII, a churchman named Cardinal Woolsey, an embattled queen named Catherine ... etc. Some of the events bear some passing resemblance to history. Very passing resemblance.    One major inaccuracy already pointed out is the sister \\"Margaret\\", who is sent off to marry the King of Portugal. In reality, this sister, Mary, was married off to the Louis XII, King of France on 9 Oct 1514, approximately six years prior to the Field of the Cloth of Gold, which was depicted in the show as occurring before \\"Margaret\\" set off on her marriage. The \\"real\\" Margaret was married off to the King of Scotland in 1503. Of course, since the Field of the Cloth of Gold was between Henry and Francis I, who succeeded Louix XII upon his death in 1515 ... well, this meeting could hardly take place if his sister was actually supposed to marry a man who had died five years prior. Also, her name was probably changed to keep her straight from Mary Boleyn and Mary, daughter of Henry VIII, though I believe they sell their audience short on their ability to keep three different Marys straight.     There are other minor juxtapositions. Henry Fitzroy, the son born to Elizabeth Blount, is depicted as having been born after the Field of the Cloth of Gold (June 1520), but in fact was born almost a year prior (July 1519). Anne Boleyn is shown as returning to England two years later, in 1522, but in the show this occurred nearly immediately after, and prior to Henry being declared Defender of the Faith (which really occurred in 1521). The list goes on and on. It was almost as if the historical facts were put into a hat, shaken vigorously, and then presented in whatever order they were drawn out again.    If you get too hung up on these details, it can set your teeth on edge. In many ways this is a disappointment,since the actual story is so much stranger than fiction could ever come up with that it really needed little to no embellishment.     However, if you forget about the historical details, it's an entertaining, rather lightweight costume drama with many good characterizations. Sam Neill is an amazing Cardinal Woolsey. Jonathan Rhys Meyers doesn't make a bad young Henry, though if you buy the date of the Field of the Cloth of Gold, he would be about thirty years old, and he comes off as considerably younger than this, even though the actor too is really about thirty himself. Maria Doyle Kennedy brings the proper gravitas to Catherine of Aragon, without falling into the common mis-characterization of her as nothing but a saintly Spaniard with a heavy accent and a heavier rosary; the real Catherine of Aragon had a keen political sense as well and they do a good job of making her something other than a plaster saint. I will be interested to see how Natalie Dormer's Anne Boleyn develops; early in the show she is doing an excellent job of playing the scheming vixen.    Don't expect history. If you want history, read the many excellent biographies written about this period. If you're just looking for something fun, put the history book down, stop looking up dates on Wikipedia, and put the many screwups aside, and just enjoy.

B0000UJDLM|3.0|When at loss for a movie, pick a comedy I say. It always cheers you up, unless it's a particularly bad comedy. But starting to watch Short Circuit, I wasn't sure what to expect. I didn't know anything apart from what the blurb said on the back. I knew Ally Sheedy from some of the 80s high school movies, and Fisher Stevens was apparently playing Apu from The Simpsons. OK then.<br /><br />Short Circuit is one of those sweet little movies, where the blurb just simply does not do it justice. Reading the blurb, I was not thrilled about watching it - it totally gives the wrong idea about the movie. Rather than a movie about robots (zzzzzz), it's a movie about a robot, who gets human feelings after being struck by lightning. Number 5, or Johnny 5 as he (it?) becomes later known at the end of the movie, is a hilarious little robot, who can mimic anything, and do anything, not believing he's a robot. He's alive!<br /><br />The plot's not THAT terrific. A previously killer robot gets struck by lightning, somehow gets human feelings, learns to drive, reads everything in sight for \\"input\\", watches TV for input, and even gets a female friend in Ally Sheedy. There are two guys chasing him, the only two who seemingly know how to reprogram him to become a killing machine again, when they originally designed him as a marital aid. (How?) There are several funny scenes, one of the stand out scenes for me being dancing to Saturday Night Fever (still a god awful film but never mind), and saying \\"input\\" constantly.<br /><br />Ally Sheedy, Fisher Stevens and the rest of the cast do brilliantly with what little they have to work with - what you'll normally find when an actor has to work opposite something CGI/puppet/animal, and the money's gone on the special effects rather than the script. The special effects were good, considering if Short Circuit was ever remade (heaven forbid) it would be full of CGI and not realistic at all. The way it has been done is good, and believable. Who says robots don't have feelings?<br /><br />Short Circuit was amazing, although having never heard of it before, I was happy to watch it and surprised when it was quite good. Johnny 5 is one of the sweetest robots you will watch in this time, when it has not been touched by CGI or any celebrity voice behind the robot. Genius.ings?

B00104QSOM|3.0|\\"There Will Be Blood,\\" which, if you haven't heard about, or seen, tells the story of an early-20th century oil tycoon, named Daniel Plainview, making his fortune in the American west. The movie tracks Plainview's rise from a lone miner (in the beginning, we see him break his leg going deep underground to grab $3 worth of gold) to a ruthless and powerful millionaire. Plainview eventually conquers a large patch of California oil territory. At the end of the movie, he is a wealthy but bitter, deranged man, shouting at his adopted son like a mad sultan.<br /><br />On a positive note, the movie looks fantastic. The period details--from the dress to the oil rigging to the polished bar wood--are excellent, and the movie won a deserved Oscar for cinematography. Daniel Day-Lewis is good in the role of Daniel Plainview, but familiar. He seems to be playing Bill the Butcher again, only this time on the West rather than East coast. Day-Lewis plays the role as bigger than life, but after a while, the movie needs less grandeur and more subtle humanity.<br /><br />I found the movie challenging, but also disappointing. For one, it's way too long. It might have been a great movie had it been about 100 minutes or so. But it simply doesn't have enough plot to justify its length. And in its two and a half hours, Day-Lewis's character occupies almost all of every scene. We don't like Plainview that much at the beginning. By the end, we loathe him. Most of the supporting cast members simply look on as we watch Day-Lewis dominate the proceedings.<br /><br />All this would be okay, I think, if director Paul Thomas Anderson knew when to let us have enough. Unfortunately, the movie's misanthropy is unrelenting and ultimately self-indulgent. That doesn't make for fun viewing. Some critics, such as Peter Travers and Roger Ebert, have brought up parallels between this movie and Citizen Kane. Kane, however, had a main character we cared about and secondary characters that were well-defined and sympathetic. Here, we see Plainview stomp and shout and threaten and drool, and after a while, we wish someone would put a bullet through his head. Charles Foster Kane could be cruel, but he was more sad than tyrannical. Plainview merely is a greedy sociopath.<br /><br />Citizen Kane also had a goal: we wanted to find out what \\"Rosebud\\" meant. Would Kane's last words solve the mystery of his life? Here, there's no sense of climax. It ends long after we feel it should have ended. And Anderson's handling of the last scene goes horribly wrong. It becomes a farce. Ever see an ending to a movie and feel like your watching the DVD extras--the version that was cut out--but you're not?<br /><br />Anderson is at his best when he doesn't try so hard. His first film, \\"Hard Eight,\\" and his previous one, \\"Punch Drunk Love,\\" are more focused than his more ambitious projects \\"Boogie Nights\\" and \\"Magnolia.\\" Anderson has lots of talent, but like his contemporary Quentin Tarantino, he's erratic. Film buffs should demand of Anderson a movie that's more than just dust, blood, whiskey, and Old Testament bluster. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" starts promisingly, but as its main character descends into madness, the drama gets weaker not stronger. \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is, at its core, about con men, but in the end, we feel like the ones who have been cheated.see Plainview stomp and shout and threaten and drool, and after a while, we wish someone would put a bullet through his head.

B00133KFGW|3.0|Letdown describes my reaction to this movie.  Told by others how much I would like this since they knew of my love for music and music lovers, set me up for this letdown.<br /><br />On the plus side, the photography was nice, and the theme of orphaned boy finally uniting with his parents is nice.<br /><br />On the down side, there was not enough of the classical side of music for me.  Further, the Irish accent of the father was hard to understand.  Overall the plot development seems too unrealistic, not that we all like fantasy now and then, but for some reason, this frustrated me in this film, and I haven't yet been able to articulate it.  Maybe the characters therefore weren't that believable?<br /><br />Compare this with Sandy Bottom Orchestra and too me, there is no comparison.  I can watch this once or twice a month and never tire.  I will not give August Rush another viewing.  The difference between a five star and three star.

The book can be summarized into these few words: the rich buy assets that generate money, and poor buy liabilities that cost them money. Also, the rich don't pay taxes by hiding behind corporations.     Well, that's pretty much it. All the rest in the book is a filler.
B0013FDM7E|5.0|Will Smith stars as scientist Robert Neville in this apocalyptic thriller about viruses and the struggle to survive.    Dr. Neville is a military scientist charged with finding a cure for a terrible virus that has supposedly sprung from a failed cure for cancer.  The virus has a 90% kill rate, and the military is moving to evacuate people from New York City.  Neville rushes his wife and daughter to a waiting helicopter, but he remains in the city; determined to find a cure for the rabid disease.  Neville himself is immune from the virus, but most are not.  To make matters worse, the military has decided to quarantine Manhattan, and soon, bridges are being blasted to prevent infected people from escaping.  Neville only has Sam, his pet German Shepard, as a companion.    Neville spends his days foraging and his nights working on a cure for the virus, using his own immune blood as a component to the vaccine.  He is also forced to deal with the Infected; mutated vampire-like zombies who are roaming the deserted streets of New York in search of prey.  He has also sent out radio messages trying to attract other immune people to come and join him.  He offers food, shelter, and safety to any immune person who can reach him.    One encounter with the Infected leaves Sam near death.  Neville takes his beloved dog home to try to save him, but Sam begins exhibiting traits like the Infected.  Sadly, Neville puts Sam down himself.  However, he isn't alone for long, as a young woman and child show up unexpectedly at his house.  She explains that God brought her to Robert's house, but he is skeptical.  Meanwhile, Robert has been experimenting on one of the Infected that he managed to capture and bring back to his house.  By using his own blood, it appears that the effects of the virus are being reversed, but it might be too late for Robert and his companions, as the other Infected have tracked Robert to his home.  Soon, the others break into the house and begin searching for Robert.  Will he survive, or will the Infected succeed in disposing of him?    This is a first-rate thriller.  Will Smith gives one of his best performances since \\"Independence Day\\" as the dedicated Dr. Neville.  The special effects are excellent as well.  It was somewhat scary looking at a deserted New York City, with weeds growing in the cracks of sidewalks and streets.  Watching lions hunt deer in the city was definitely strange, too.    I rate this movie very highly.  The story is very good, and the acting and special effects will keep the viewer interested until the end.  Watch \\"I Am Legend\\" and experience what it might be like to be the last person on Earth.
B0011FXLCC|3.0|Feels like a belated follow-up to the classic \\"Felt Mountain\\". A very different sound to the two intervening albums. To my ears not in the same league as the debut but pretty good all the same.    I'd give the music four stars - but dock this \\"deluxe\\" package to three stars as I don't think the extras are worth the additional cost. As well as some postcards and an arty little lyric booklet, there's a DVD of the video for A&E, and a sort of rambling home movie by Alison and Will which isn't particularly illuminating - the video is more laughable than anything really, reminding me of a pisstake of the original \\"Wickerman\\" movie, though I'm sure that wasn't the intent. It's the sort of video that can damage your enjoyment of the actual song. The little CD-sized box everything comes in is good quality however.
B000002L9B|4.0|This is one of Prince's richest and most colorful releases.  He covers an awful lot of ground stylistically in a pretty short amount of time, so there's little consistency in tone and sound, and that ends up being both an asset AND a weakness on this album.  The good thing though is that even the weakest material isn't so much bad as it is just mediocre, so the album still ends up making for a pretty solid listen throughout (some people think \\"Venus De Milo\\" and \\"Do U Lie?\\" are really bad, I just think they're, at worst, mediocre--\\"Do U Lie?\\" isn't stellar overall, but it has at least one major redeeming quality).  There's a lot of airy instrumentation and the focus primarily is on bright, bold and colorful chords (that's one thing that's fairly consistent about the album).  Prince really piles it on with the multilayered arrangements on many of the tracks, with rich horn sections being key and multipart harmony also frequently playing a significant part.  He starts things off with the full blown orchestration of \\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\" which features an absolutely magnificent multipart harmony with him, Wendy, Lisa, and Wendy's sister Susannah (who shows up on multipart harmonies throughout the album from what I've read).  He gives a strong nod to Caribbean music here too in part of the horn section, and I think this marks the first time that Prince delved into that area.  He keeps it up on the next track too; a Caribbean style steel drum turns up on \\"New Position\\" (much of this album has a real celebratory feel, and what better way to express \\"celebratory\\" than to focus on parades and the Caribbean Islands :).  \\"New Position\\" is a solid, bare, stripped down Funk number.  Wendy, who seems to have really stepped into the forefront on this album, actually sings the lead on \\"I Wonder U\\"; it isn't as strong as the first two songs, but it at least still has a great groove going for it.  The ballad \\"Under the Cherry Moon\\", with its obvious nod to traditional Frenchmusic, (the movie was based in France so this soundtrack is sprinkled with both subtle and not so subtle French references throughout) is solid.  The Funk track that follows it though is outstanding; \\"Girl and Boys\\" is a fully layered Funk number with a clever reference to the French theme in the chorus.  He then goes from doing a little too much (the somewhat cluttered \\"Life Can Be So Nice\\") to doing a little too little (the flowery and pleasant but borderline insipid instrumental piece \\"Venus De Milo\\").  The next track \\"Mountains\\" is another solid, fully layered Funk number (an interesting note about this track is that the music was actually written by Wendy and Lisa while the lyrics were penned by Prince).  I don't know if Prince was trying to make up for the fact that \\"Mountains\\" is built primarily on a single chord or what, but there are constant changes in key on the follow up, the faux-French music-fest \\"Do U Lie?\\".  This song isn't exactly stellar, but being able to listen to Prince go through almost his entire vocal range in under 3 minutes makes listening to it worth it.  I don't know many people who aren't familiar with \\"Kiss\\", but this stripped down Funk number with the butt-kicking both lead and rhythm guitar work fully deserves to be the big hit that it is.  \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\" is just phenomenal.  The arrangement is just brilliant and the chord progressions, especially in the second verse are just absolutely incredible.  There's a multipart harmony with Wendy and Lisa singing the countermelody towards the end of the 2nd verse that just blows me away every time.  Then he ends the album off on a really high note with the slow, affecting ballad \\"Sometimes It Snows In April\\".  This album was a tough one to rate; it sags a bit in the middle but even the weaker material usually has at least a few interesting ideas, and even the weaker moments don't really detract from it being a generally solid listen all throughout.  So, even with the weaker material, I still think this is essential listening: it really helps in giving you an understanding of Prince's breadth as a composer, even when the results of his experiments aren't exactly staggering.  When the album is good, it's *really* good (\\"Christopher Tracy's Parade\\", \\"Girls & Boys\\", \\"Kiss\\", \\"Anotherloverholenyohead\\", \\"Sometimes it Snows in April\\"...\\"Mountains\\" is really strong too), and even the weak material still at least has something interesting going on.  So, taking the time to dig into this one should prove to be well-worth it.
B000A6T1JU|1.0|This version is a sad joke.  The original movie gets 4 or 5 stars, this \\"ultimate directors cut\\" should get zero.    Here's the original: [[ASIN:B0000541AM The Warriors]]
B00104QSOM|4.0|There isn't much wrong with a movie with no happy ending.  Hollywood almost fetishizes the need for a complete, emotionally uplifting ending, while some of the best products that come out of it (\\"Seven,\\" \\"Resevoir Dogs\\") have very UNHAPPY endings.  \\"There Will Be Blood\\" is that type of movie.  It's beautiful to look at, stunningly acted, luxuriously filmed, and brilliantly directed, yet some folks were upset there was no salvation for Daniel Day Lewis' conniving oilman.  Lewis' Daniel Plainview isn't the type who is looking for salvation in the sense we see it anyway.  He's willing to go and be baptized, but it's for the alternate worldly purpose to get access to a tract for its oil.    The beauty of the movie is in the details.  Day Lewis and Paul Dano play men each in the grips of an obsessive worldview.  For Daniel Plainview, it's the persuit of oil and wealth.  For the man who will be his nemesis, Dana's teen apocalyptic preacher Eli Sunday, it's the salvation of souls.  Each man is ultimately destroyed by their obsessions, but Paul Anderson doesn't hit us over the head with the message.  He is as brilliant letting the actors develop their own take on the characters' doom as he is in the choice of shots which shows modern-day filmgoers the true beauty and bleakness of the west at the turn of the 20th century.    Day Lewis is justifyably praised for his portrayal of the ruthless oilman, with all the delicate soul-searching and dare I say tenderness of the man, mixed in with his calculated huckster's bombasity.  What is often overlooked is Dano's softspoken approach with the ultimately hypocritical Eli.  Dano portrays him as, at first, quietly intense and earnest, if a little consumed by his evangelical zeal.  However, without hammering out what is to become of him, Dano shows us the similarities between Eli and Daniel, including the outrageous \\"driving out of the Devil\\" he trots out at his church.  We expect, and yet are sadly shocked, by Eli's unravelling at theend.  We see it coming, and yet are taken aback at its rapaidity.  Paul Dano certainly deserves some of the credit for carrying \\"Blood.\\"    If there's one disappointment in the film itself, it IS the abruptness of the destruction of these two men.  The film's deliberate pace makes us feel there should have been more.  Instead, we see an explosion of rage and violence, with a denuemont that's too quickly over, leaving us in the audience to say, \\"Wha.....?\\"  A disappointment Anderson and his filmwriter couldn't have been as deliberate with the ending as they were with the rest of the movie.    Still, as I read in another review, home video will make watching \\"Blood\\" repeatedly necessary and enjoyable.  This generation's \\"Blade Runner?\\"  One can hope so.
B0013D8LOU|4.0|It can never replace the original with Angela Lansberry, but this is a very close 2nd. All I can say is TIm Burton must've had an interesting childhood.     Johnny Depp is fantastic, Helen Bonham-Carter is fierce, funny and disturbing. This is a must have.    I wonder what priest taste like. Probably like chicken.
B000002L9M|5.0|I love this album more than any other by Depeche mode, simply because it is the only in their catalogue, where Martin gets to sing a significant proportion of the album. His contributions are outstanding and his best ever. 'A question of lust' has one of the best melodies ever written, same for the exquisite 'It doesn't matter two' and the sublime 'world full of nothing'. These are all ballads with exquisite melodies. 'Sometimes' is also lovely and nothing like 'somebody', except that it is a stripped down ballad. Martin also duets with David on the melodic and catchy 'here is the house'. I also don't understand the opinion that 'dressed in black' is a weak song. I instantly loved this song and like David's dark tones.  A fantastic album more focussed on ballads and this is not a bad thing.
B000P0J0AQ|5.0|The Matrix is a pivotal film in the history of film.  While that may seem overstated, The Matrix deserves every ounce of acclaim it has garnished over the years. Before this film, we didn't truly know action could be so good!<br /><br />Neo (Keanu Reeves) is a mundane computer geek who lives an equally mundane existence. Until he takes an unexpected trip down the rabbit hole.  Morpheus (Laurence Fishburne), the legendary man who is only whispered about by the kind of people Neo knows, contacts him and offers him a choice: Learn what the Matrix is, or stay in your regular old life and remain unfulfilled.<br /><br />He asks, \\"Did you ever have a dream you were so sure was real?\\"  The philosophical influences in the Matrix are obvious to anyone familiar with works of  Descartes.  Neo chooses to learn what the Matrix really is, and that's when the fun really begins. Trinity (Carrie- Ann Moss) kicks some serious butt.  Neo finds out the truth is scarier than fiction, and that reality is never what it seems to be.  Love soon develops between Neo and Trinity, but not before Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving) steps in to try to stop any hope from triumphing in a world dominated by killer machines.  Are you ready for The Matrix?
0802130208|5.0|It's a great book, really funny, makes you laugh all along. The main character is a complete freak that loves to make other people lives a complete joke, but he really means it.<br />Really recommend it, gives you an idea of the life on New Orleans around the 60s.<br />Dont doubt it. Buy it!!!
B000N3T0DW|4.0|Carlos Gardel was a very popular tango singer during the late twenties and early thirties in Argentina. Lost to Hispanics due to a tragic airplane accident at Medellin's (Colombia) airport, he became almost inmediately a myth of the Spanish cult of the dead; and is one of his famous songs Volver, turned into \\"rumba flamenca\\" and performed by Penelope Cruz in one of the scenes of this sentimental movie, which gives to it the main title.     Full of references to the convention, and with characters taken maybe from reality or maybe from Latin television soap operas,[many references to TV programs are present and even a recreation of a popular and actual one in Spain] Volver is an ironic, humorous, and typical Almodovar's farce whose roots may go backwards to very old techniques of Spanish culture.
B000YEUUCK|5.0|Celine Dion: live in Las Vegas is a must have item for Celine's fan...   Crystal clear picture with top sound quality.  And i do like the extra feature \\"A new Day: Secret\\".  It is the same show but with different prespective of view. You can see how is everyone doing backstage while she is singing.   Also there is a feature that show how Celine was almost gave up with her own project, \\"live show in Las Vegas\\", because she is suddenly pregnant, and etc...     End of the line, this is one of my favorite bluray!
B000XA5K48|5.0|O.K., this has to be said.....\\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is by far, the best double entendre laden, cliche' riddled, testosterone drenched film of the year! You can't but laugh all the way through this film. C'mon, where else can you see a bad guy looking good making \\"good\\" guys look bad?! I knew Clive Owen would do good here, if his stint in \\"Sin City\\" was any indicator. For those who didn't like this film, you take yourselves and this film, too seriously! Sure, there were stunts that absolutely defy the laws of physics, armed goons who couldn't hit the broad side of a barn with a machine gun (and some of them DID have machine guns!), not to mention a bulletproof baby with a penchant for headbanging music,along with the ubiquitous hooker with a heart of gold, but hey, what were you expecting? Just by the LOOK of the cover art, this couldn't have been anything else!    All the principles played their parts to the hilt! Clive Owen, it seems, came from the Steve McQueen school of acting. Monica Belucci is as gorgeous as ever, and Paul Giamatti played Owens' foil perfectly! The guns. MY GAAWWD! The guns were all over the place (I bet the Anti-Gunners were beside themselves), and the carrots. I'll bet Owen never wants to see another carrot for the rest of his life!    \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" is a popcorn flick of the first order! For all the haters, go back to watching \\"Mary Poppins\\" or something. In the meantime, I'll be watching \\"Shoot 'Em Up\\" again! You could do worse, but why would you?!
B000BCE918|5.0|These movies are great entertainment....my kids (6,8,19) love these as do I.  Watched them many many times , the price is unbeatable for all 3 in one box set.  Does ANYONE know who is playing the MUSIC during the opening where Universal movie scenes are being shown??  I can't find anything about this music!!
B0013D8LOU|5.0|I love the tale of Sweeney Todd.  I have been since I first saw a recording of the stage production back in the early 90's.  When I heard that Tim Burton was helming a big screen adaptation I was ecstatic.  Finally something to wash away the abomination vomited forth by John Schlesinger that starred Ben Kingsley.<br /><br />My hopes were high and I was not disappointed.  Yes, the film adaptation removed some of the musical scenes found in the Sondheim stage show, but they where scenes that would probably have left a movie going audience feeling that the movie was to long.  We didn't need the scene of Judge Turpin flagellating himself for his impure thoughts to realize he was not a good person.  As much as I would have liked the intro to have the Ballad of Sweeney Todd it wasn't needed to help layout the story.<br /><br />To me this was a well cast, well acted, well directed and truthful adaptation to the stage play.
B0011TQLA2|5.0|When i first listened my intial reaction was \\"OK - another good radiohead album\\".  But the more I listen to this CD the more I realize what a great acheivement it is.  Sonically it has a gorgeous production with plenty of depth and layers tht lure you in.  Sylistically, it may bear the close resemblance to previous efforts; but from beginning to end this the strongest and my favorite.  ********** 10 STARS !!!!!!!!!!!!  ( to make up for the idiot who gave it 1 )
B00026WU9Q|5.0|1965 masterpiece from Bob Dylan marking his transition from folk singer to rocker. Contains not only his greatest song \\"Mr. Tambourine Man\\" but other works of genius \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\", \\"Maggie's Farm\\", \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\" and finishes appropriately with \\"It's All Over Now, Baby Blue\\". Dylan was on fire at this time and was to follow this up just five months later with \\"Highway 61 Revisited\\". Great album cover as well.<br /><br />Trivia: This album has been released in some countries as the more prosaically titled \\"Subterranean Homesick Blues\\".
B00008NRLX|5.0|just a beautiful little album.  my boyfriend bought it for me last spring, and I'm still in love with it.  lovely melodies, simple but beautiful harmonies, country twinged guitar.  not a single song on it that I would skip.    definitely recommended for fans of Wilco (and check out Golden Smog if you like Wilco AND the Jayhawks-- it's a combo-side-project.) and other modern folk-y artists.
B000001EUN|5.0|When this album came out, most people were floored.  Not only did it rock, but it was \\"radio-ready\\" without  sounding too bubbly (if ya catch my drift).  This album is a classic. If I could point out a strong point,   I would, however, this collection of songs in its entirety  IS a strong point.  Classic Scorps with hooks galore!  Don't miss this one!
B0000E5NPZ|3.0|Would've been more captivating had it been the first time I'd seen this kind of movie, but it wasn't. Technical aspects held my interest -- especially the cinematography; the use of black and white for the present and color for flashbacks was effective. The performances were okay.  Jean Seberg is easy on the eyes.  Her real life story is more interesting than any of her film roles.  It's an inkblot.
0307383415|5.0|I bought this book shortly after Barack Obama ran for his Senate seat.  I finished about half of it before I had to set it aside and then forgot about it.  After his recent speech on race in America, which I consider to be the most important public dialogue on the topic since MLK's \\"I have a Dream\\" speech, I picked up this book and finished it. Senator Obama has written an incredibly courageous, incredibly honest, and incredibly insightful commentary on an American life that is at once the story of all of us while still being uniquely his own.  In comparison to Hillary Clinton's memoir, Obama's text didn't feel like it was edited with his future electability in mind.  He was honest about the good and the bad, brutally honest about his father and grandmother.  He was remarkably quiet about his mother.  It was as if she didn't exist in his life.  I don't understand if this is the truth of the matter or if  Obama purposefully ignored that relationship for literary purposes.  Nonetheless, I found the story of his father to be painfully bittersweet.  Who hasn't felt the pain of a relationship unrealized.  I have a new respect for the man.  I highly recommend this book for anyone interested in the role of race in American society, as well as the story of the man who may be President.
B000NVIXDW|1.0|Okay Michael, your irresponsible, that was to easy and this CD is sooooo bad, nothing new here or to hear.  Me and Misses Jones, oh plezzzz, It Had Better Be Tonight was better in A Shot in the Dark. Such a great singer singing trite, boring, and weird material.
B00005221M|4.0|The Last Of The Mohicans  DVD<br /><br />Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe star in this movie loosely based on James Fennimore Cooper's novel,[[ASIN:1593083351 The Last of the Mohicans (Barnes & Noble Classics)]], about a scout, Hakweye ( Daniel Day-Lewis ) in the French and Indian war circa 1757.<br /><br />Recommended for students of the French and Indian war and for fans of Daniel Day-Lewis and Madeleine Stowe.<br /><br />Gunner  April, 2008
0007107927|5.0|It's short, simple and reinforces its main points.  The book is so efficient and well done, there is never a \\"need\\" to reread it, but people do.  That says something.
B000UVT3OI|4.0|This CD has a lot of great songs on it. Some of the songs I preferred on the  Garth Live album, but I haven't been able to find \\"What She's Doin Now\\" anywhere else, so it made me happy. The CD case is a little flimsy (not the most effective design) but most people import their music onto a computer, anyway, so the CD case isn't that important. I'm glad I bought this CD/DVD pack.
B00005JPSM|3.0|Even though I'm a  normal guy, I'm not a reflexive chick-flick hater. Although most are unbearable, a few movies of that genre actually have engaging storylines, humor, likeable characters and portray men as something more than one-dimensional props who say and do abjectly ridiculous things we would never do in real life. \\"No Reservations\\" is not one of those enjoyable chick-flicks, although it's not one of the worst. In fact, in pretty much every way, it's a bland, neutral toned, one-note, white bread, middle of the road, droning hum of a movie- not a disaster, but not very interesting either. There is zero humor, no volcanic conflicts, no earth-shaking passion, no irresistible attraction. What you have to entertain you for an hour and a half is watching a developing relationship between two ordinary, boring people (the male lead is considered \\"zany\\" because he listens to opera) whose romance is temporarily disturbed by a minor misunderstanding towards the end of the movie. Muzak-fans will love it.
B000M3452Y|2.0|I read the reviews of this cd and expected to get something I did not.  My favorite track was \\"Us v. Them\\" which sounds a bit like a poor man's Talking Heads.  The songs tend to get monotonous and the vocals do not seem appropriate to the music at all, in fact they got on my nerves most of the time.  If you want a great electronic/dance/rock cd check out MGMT's first full length LP Oracular Spectacular.  I has everything that Sound of Silver lacks and a lot more.
B00008EY9G|3.0|[SPOILER WARNING]<br /><br />.....<br /><br />the writers didn't pull the cheap trick of telling us that the story we'd been following and the characters we'd been identifying with through the entire movie only existed in some crazy guy's head, and then using their lunatic deus ex machina to tie up their inconsistent plot points. I was enjoying it up until that revelation, at which point I ceased to care.
B000WTLDPU|5.0|This typically isn't the type of movie I'd watch, but since I was in the dog house with the wife I figured I'd watch it with her as a way to get on her good side. As it turned out, I actually like this movie. I'd recommend it to anybody.
0812548094|5.0|Well WOW is in the title because that is how I felt about this book.  I really do not think that I've ever read the second book in a series and thought that it was quite the caliber of the first book and with Wizards First Rule being the amazing book that it was I REALLY didn't expect it here...in two words....pleasantly superfulific!
B000AYEL6U|3.0|plot is good but rather draggy for a plot that can be summarize in less than a minute. This series speaks of slavery and difference in status between the poor and also the powerful and how both depends on each other to survive.  Romance part of it is pretty straight forward and predictable.
B000VWYJ86|5.0|The third part of the series is a mile-a-minute movie!  It hits the ground running and doesn't stop until the credits roll.  A definte must-watch movie that has Matt Damon in the role that defines his career.
B0011HOEY4|4.0|American Gangster was a solid movie all around coming in at a little less than two hours.  It features some excellent acting in Washington, Crowe, Ruby Dee, Common, Cuba Gooding Jr. and sooo many others bring this great movie to life for all to see.  While it might not be anything new to the genre it does what some try and fail to do.  That's keep the audience entertained for the whole movie.  Its based on Frank Lucas and the cop who go toe to toe with each other throughout the movie.  Lucas (Washington) being the head of a very well organized and weathly drug empire and he does it well keeping it within the family.<br /><br />Its a treat to sit down and watch a movie of this caliber and walk away having enjoyed your time with it.  Its better than seeing it at the movie because this 2 Disc version.  It shows how they went about making American Gangster-in detail and some Case Files on this as well.  So it brings a bigger perspective and is worth it to purchase in its own right.  Loads of talent in front of and behind the screen getting down the music of the era, the look of that time and just people's overall mentality was different then than now.  That is shown as well throughout the movie.<br /><br />Enjoyed the movie a lot and would recommend to anyone even if your not a Denzel or Russell fan.  You'll still walk away from this movie pleased to have taken time out to see it.
B00005JPD0|4.0|DejaVu is a ride on a roller-coaster called: creative suspense.  Some very imaginative ideas were interspersed into this plot, which offers glimpses of \\"Minority Report\\"'s futuristic crime solving, but Denzel Washington gives a performance a step (or two) above Tom Cruise's version.  The sequence of events peaks the imagination in DejaVu, and supplies well enough camoflaged leads, that makes the production a progression of links into the climax, transitions that are as smooth as possible, with only a minimal amount of fragmentational scenes which never seem to add-up.  Its a difficult theme to digest, even after the movie.  The whole idea tooses back and forth from being Far-fetched, to anything's possible, and Denzel is a key ingredient for making DejaVu's mysterious premis as believable as it could ever get.  Acting is excellent, Action is adequate, Suspense is sometimes subtle, but always  present.
B0012Q94QW|2.0|This movie was one of the worst I had seen in a long time.  From it's corny love story to it's horrible ending.  Please do not waist your money on this movie.  Wait for it to come out on cable and you will see why.  It seems like now-a-days every movie is worried about the special effects and not about the story it's self.  It's always one or the other.  Either a good story or good special effects.  If the writers of 10,000 B.C need to be fired.  If this movie had been written by a better writter it may have actually been a decent film.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Come on, Lucasfilm. You know we are all waiting for this release.<br /><br />Everybody who thinks the same, please leave a comment.
0143038419|5.0|I absolutely love this book & had so much fun reading it. Liz Gilbert's writing is so charming & entertaining. I loved the honesty about her personal life & all her little neurosis. And as much as the book made me laugh, it also gave me some real little nuggets of wisdom along the way. Her adventures reminded me why I love to travel & inspired me to get out there & embrace the free spirit that lives inside me.
B00005K3OT|5.0|I had never seen this movie before... I watched it & knew I wanted to own it.  I ordered it... received it VERY shortly in MINT condition.  Everything was GREAT!!
B0004Z33G4|5.0|whats to say this collection is awesome all 3 movies in one box set! only regret is there coming out with a 4th one and its not yet included same thing happened to me with my Rocky collection.
B00133KFGW|5.0|This movie is a modern day fairy tale! Sure, it probably would never happen in real life. Isn't that what a fairy tale is anyway? Make-believe? For those people who can let themselves get caught up in, and enjoy the fairy tale of this story, then you will love it! The love story is heart-wrenching and the music is beautiful. I did not want this movie to end!
B001041JLE|5.0|This CD is great the DVD is a great addition as well.  The extra songs will never compare to the originals, come on its Michael Jackson no one can touch him.  however some are exceptional.
B000TEUCFA|5.0|Stacey Kent's \\"Breakfast on the Morning Tram\\" sounds like an audio journal from a global traveler: slightly world-weary but still enthusiastic, still hoping for ... ? Her trademark lyrical clarity combined with confident, understated yet adventuresome musical phrasing makes her singing a delight. For this CD she has moved beyond the American songbook and standards that make up many of her prior recordings. The songs and sound are fresh. Several songs, with lyrics by Japanese novelist Kazuo Ishiguro, ignore \\"songbook-style\\" rhymes for a more modern storytelling mode -- still catchy -- beautifully delivered by Stacey Kent's incomparable voice. This a a GREAT CD -- perhaps her best so far. My wish? Combine Ishiguro lyrics with more Brazilian-influenced melodies (Jobim? Gilberto? Tomlinson?) for a whole \\"Stacey Goes South\\" CD of updated samba and bossanova tunes. My other wish? Just where is that morning tram that serves breakfast?
0312360266|1.0|I have a weakness for books with pretty covers.  The cover lived up to my expectations, but the book most certainly did not.  It was not so very long ago that I was a teenager.  I think a person should be able to indentify with the character, but I would not relate to the cultural cliche that was Zoey.  I've never known anyone surrounding me to talk quite so bubble-headed.  The story was painfully slow and, at times, I thought half of the text useless to the plot.  I always finish a book that I start before beginning another.  I was almost crying with frustration to finish this one and move onto something with more substance.  This should have been a one day read, but it took months for me to claw through.  It was as if all the words were thrown together to form some sort of messy collage to decipher.  This is the simplest and badly written young adult novel I've come across.
B000XTLUW0|3.0|The performance itself is great, but the audio (coming directly from the mixer rather than from an \\"audience perspective\\" set of mics) makes it sound almost like a studio recording rather than a live show.  For live shows 1/2 the fun is in how grand and large the sound is, but this isn't reflected on the DVD.    The editing of the video is ok, but makes it more like a music video (faster cuts, lots of crowd shots, lots of close ups).  But I'd prefer more full-stage shots that show the back drop and effects.     The sound issue annoys me more than the editing issue, but oh well.  Still a good one, just not as good as the absolution tour dvd.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It felt like an extended TV episode but I am a great Stargate fan so they can do no wrong with me. The agent turned bad was a bit predictable but he got his just desserts.  I fully recommend this movie.
B000VBJEEG|4.0|As with most animated films, this really is more for adults than children.  Why do they need to include a scene of a woman trying to shoot her man and then after the struggle for the gun they kiss?!  It wasn't needed.  Other than that and one swearing scene from the bad guy head chef, it's a lot of fun.  Defintely purchase w/ Amazon.  Barnes and Noble prices (in store) are twice as much.  Enjoy!
B0012GMVLM|4.0|The third Alan Parsons Project album was kind of lost in the middle of his Sci-Fi progressive epic [[ASIN:B000JLQSW4 I Robot]] and the hits that started coming once he released [[ASIN:B0012GMWJS Eve]]. It is one of the few APP albums to not notch a top 40 single. It's also the last of his truly old-school free-from FM Radio rock albums, playing heavily with the instrumentations and the concept.<br /><br />For this album, it was the Pyramid Craze and the fascination with King Tut that informed the songs. The unconventional instrumentation of \\"In The Lap Of The Gods\\" was the last time Parsons would enter into that kind of symphonic lustre, and APP's trademark instrumental style makes two appearances with \\"Hyper Gamma Spaces\\" and \\"Voyager.\\" The terrific ballads drop in with \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\" and Colin Blunstone's well sung \\"The Eagle Will Rise Again.\\"<br /><br />The thematic leaning towards making monuments to yourself (\\"What Goes Up\\" and \\"You Can't Take it With You\\") make for intriguing, thoughtful songs, while the goofy \\"Pyramania\\" is the song that actually does fiddle around with the Pyramid theme (and may be the most humorous thing APP ever recorded) the most. But the main theme of the album, man's quest for immortality, is the over-riding purpose of the songs. Be it our desires and doubts toward be the biggest and most noticed (\\"If all things will fall, why build a miracle at all?\\") to our own refusal to acknowledge our folly (\\"The last thing of all that was on my mind was the close at the end of the show\\" from \\"Shadow of a Lonely Man\\"), this was the last Alan Parsons Project to really touch me emotionally. While future and more popular albums ([[ASIN:B000IOM1Y6 Eye in the Sky]], [[ASIN:B000IOM1Z0 Turn of a Friendly Card]]) are still good albums overall, they were more focused on a glossy and streamlined sound. \\"Pyramid\\" was a grandiose goodbye to the 70's, and still holds a special place in my CD collection.<br /><br />So where's the remaster, already?
B0010X73ZG|4.0|Just to add to the already growing reviews on this product.  It is worth the added disc.  The film is worth atleast 1 watch also.  As for the praise it has received I believe those folks get the point.  Those who gave it 1 star I am still trying to figure out if they understand the concept of stars, and averages.  I have read those, and do not see it adding up.  How can it have an average of 3-1/2 stars if there are mostly 5 star ratings across the board?  Not sure about 5 stars, but, definitely worth more than 1 star even if you are blind.
B00006AW2F|2.0|The history of the odds-and-ends package begins on its release date - June 6, 1975 - the same day The Rolling Stones released Made in the Shade. As a means to steal some thunder, former business manager Allen Klein dived into the vast vault of material that he had legal control over for this album on his ABKCO label.<br /><br />The tracks are from 1964-1970, with the CD including three tracks not on the initial U.S. album - (Walkin' Thru The) Sleepy City, Some Things Just Stick in Your Mind and Try a Little Harder. Bill Wyman's Downtown Suzie, the demo of Out of Time and Heart of Stone - featuring then top session guitarist, Jimmy Page - are the interesting cuts in what was an album released for all the wrong reasons.
B0014Z4OQG|3.0|Cloverfield\\" is a J.J. Abrams-produced monster flick shot in \\"The Blair Witch\\" fashion. And I am not just talking about its shaky hand-held camera; its elaborate marketing tactics also reminds me of the 1999 maga-hit horror movie that turned out not so scary after all. I wouldn't be surprised if there is talk of making a sequel to \\"Cloverfield.\\"     The difference is, I think, \\"Cloverfield,\\" in which something huge and ferocious attacks Manhattan, is really scary when it wants to. The film has several nice shots of the monster and its attack with top-notch visual and sound effects. The process of the total destruction of the city is seen from the viewpoint of ordinary people, and some of the shots including the clouds of dust in the street after buildings collapse are realistic, obvious references to 9/11, but frankly I really don't know these references are necessary.    Interestingly, the film's digital camera approach, which is intended to create realism, often makes its images look more artificial. Characters are supposed to be running, but a guy named \\"Hud,\\" obviously not a professional cameraman, manages to get great shots. He never misses a chance to shoot wherever he is, and he is very good at it, not a shot out of focus. And these people including Hud never really try to leave the city under siege.     But I maybe I shouldn't complain. The story of \\"Cloverfield\\" is only borrowing many elements from other numerous B-monster films, where a small group of main characters must do something heroic when the crowd is running for their lives, and the military is brave but always useless, and so on, the formula Spielberg did in \\"War of the World\\" (with the 9/11 references again). Without its digital camera and seasickness, \\"Cloverfield\\" is just a standard monster film with some nice visual effects.
B0001GMIOE|5.0|Don't waste your time with the fake batteries.  I bought a Targus clone for my 20D and the battery died within a year.  Targus support is ignoring me.  I should have just stuck with Canon batteries from the very start.
B00013M6NK|5.0|Just what I was looking for to replace my battery and keep taking pictures when I run out of power in my Nikon Coolpix.
0064430227|5.0|This is a great book to get in hardcover because you will use it alot if you have children of your own. If you are a children's literature collector you will want to look at older hard to find copies to invest in. For the rest of us this is a beloved favorite baby gift, but an even better first grader book. If you have a slow reader this book will help those who are struggling to read the opportunity to read a BIG book and for reasons I do not know it is often a \\"boy\\" favorite. The language is not babyish or unfriendly to adults so it will be a great laptime read for uncles and aunts to read as fill in bedtime readers.
B000IHY9SE|4.0|Alright, I know I have been out of the loop for sometime and I did not get a chance to review the record during the time of its release. But I am gonna do it nearly a year since its release.  This is a good mixtape for the Shady camp, which introduces two new Emcees to the camp - - Bobby Creekwater & Ca$his. Each Emcee has a strength to their lyrical flow which can be displayed throughout the album on tracks like \\"There He Is\\", \\"Everything is Shady\\" &  \\"We're Back\\" just to name a few.  The other Shady artists like D12, 50 Cent & Obie Trice seems to hold their own as well...Obie spits just as good as he did on his sophomore release \\"Second Rounds on Me\\" and D12 remain strong despite the passing of Proof (R.I.P.) on most of the tracks on the album. As for 50...he finally shows his strength on this album lyrically since he doesnt have total control on the album's content...just the way it needs to be.  For Eminem, well...he shows that he can still cut it better than any of these young wipper-snappers in the Rap Industry. On tracks like \\"We're Back\\", \\"Jimmy Crack Corn\\", and the best track \\"No Apologies\\"; Eminem shows his range of lyrical prowess, giving people that doubting him that he slacked off a middle-finger to all.  Production of Eminem has grown drastically and darker and even more bass to it despite a couple of tracks that were produce by The Alchemist, Mr. Porter & Akon.  Overall, \\"The Re-Up\\" is a good \\"Mixtape\\" album and probably would have done well if it stayed in the streets instead of release to the coporate masses. But, regardless, it shows of things to come from the Shady camp...
B000K7VHQE|5.0|CHICK PICK DRAMEDY! If you need a good film to watch and do not want to take the chance on a dud, you can pick this one BUT- this is  a painfully slow at times-with a \\" wait, wait, it gets better\\" kind of flick.  The ending is key because it leaves you with the spirit that ALL of our families are crazy and that we all still have to get along in life and find our own way.  Its characters are a quirky mob of oddities entangled into one car trip to see the youngest family member attend a beauty pageant. It is painfully obvious to only the audience that she is not a beauty pageant kind of girl. The only really SANE people in this cast of antics are the little girl Olive who the movie is titled after and her Mother who holds everyone's straight jackets at bay. You will see a lot of stereotypes of some of the people you have loved and hated in your life: the nutcase adult brother who tried to commit suicide and is moving in, that dope smoking grandfather who is getting laid everyday at the nursing home, the father who wants to be a motivational speaker, the teenager who is living in persecution, AND you will see the story of how hard it is to feel beautiful as a young girl growing up in a madhouse of American-ideal expectations of what is pretty little girl.  RICH CHICKS writes reviews for the public to help you make the right choice for your entertainment dollar.  Check out our other reviews for more straight talk. This is movie is worth buying second hand, it would be a nice gift brand new, and don't forget to wait for the ending...
B000RG1FMO|4.0|Kanye West has always been known for going against the grain of others in the Rap Industry. \\"Graduation\\" seems to solitify him as one of the best for innovation lyrically and productions. Each beat are deeper, darker & bass pounding besides tracks like \\"Good Life (ft. T-Pain)\\" & \\"Homecoming (ft. Chris Martin)\\". Each track has its positive strong points with good lyrical craft from Mr. West. The feature artist on the album are not exactly rapping but more crooning on the hooks from Dwele, Mos-Def, Chris Martin & T-Pain; this allows Kanye to venture into the world of the unknown. The most shocking track on the whole album is \\"Big Brother\\", which he dedicates his whole career to his \\"brother\\" Jay Z; the beat is sick also.  Overall, the ablum is strong regardless it is only thirteen tracks on the album. But, each track is strong and supberb and carries the album to platinum status.
B0010YSD7M|5.0|As a HUGE fan of Stargate SG1; this wrapped up the story nicely.... however, it really made me want more Stargate SG1 - which is a sign of a great ending!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Great film! Very exciting and unique. It felt like a thrill ride. I have noticed that many people are complaining about the style of the film (ie: camerawork). If you don't want something new and different, just stick with the same old 'cookie-cutter' crud. If you like new concepts in film and good horror/sci-fi/action...don't pass this up!
B0013BNY2Q|5.0|Although all the REM CDs are amazing, this one is the BEST in a long time.  I was skeptical at first, given I heard nothing of this until it was released, but it's still worth it.  Every song is unique, strong rocking and one of the best albums of the year.  Get this if you care about good music.
1596912855|5.0|I LOVED this book!  Along with most females in this world, I am a huge Pride & Prejudice nut, so I was very much attracted to the idea of this novel.  Once I started it I could hardly put it down (sorry kids!).  It wasn't just the deliciously romantic plot that I loved.  I also loved Hale's writing style.  This is the first book of hers that I've read, and it was so enjoyable.  Such an easy, lighthearted, laugh-out-loud funny and witty thing to read.  The perfect book for all those hopeless romantics who can't get enough of Austen's masterpiece \\"Pride & Prejudice.\\"  I loved how Hale tapped into the secret desires of every woman- that we're Elizabeth Bennett and someday Mr. Darcy is going to fall madly in love with us.  The character in this book decides she's giving up her fantasy to be with Mr. Darcy because he's not real.  But then she realizes (at least this is how I interprated it) that he is real.  He exists in the man who you fall in love with and who falls in love with you.  For instance me- I have my own Mr. Darcy, and his name is Joel.  Highly recommend this book!
B0014BECF8|5.0|My brother was visiting England while George Michael was touring and picked up the Import CD for me. It is simply delicious! Regardless of how a person feels about his lifestyle choices the music & lyrics are just damn good! His songs have been covered by Joan Baez, Alicia Keys, Michael Buble, and Savage Garden. The man just writes with quality and honesty behind them that is difficult to find this day an age in popular music. In general I am a music lover. Madonna, Prince, Seal, Annie Lennox, Sting, U2, with George Michael at the top of my list!
B0007Y08IS|1.0|What a heap of junk! Look carefully you'll see the strings bouncing around in front of your very eyes.The puppets are cute but come on.South Park was funny this is just stupid.I guess I found this movie as appalling as our candidates running for the presidency.What a waste of time.Sorry folks open up your trash cans and throw it in.....But don't be surprised if the garbage men throw it back on your yard.
0452289963|5.0|I have been on a journey for the past 16 years and have read many many books about enlightenment, meditation, the mind, ego, God, and books on chakras, crystals, herbs, tarot cards. I do Yoga and I meditate. Every single morning I listen to Louis Hay's Morning/Evening meditation on my cassette player.<br /><br />I studied and read A Course in Miracles worked the workbook for two years running. I studied Krishnamurti, Trunpa, Tulku, as a philosophy major in college and continued reading eastern philosophy long after I graduated.<br /><br />In other words, I am no novice to this New Age. What is it all about? Finally, I see clearly what's the journey's purpose; what everything, in its own way, was pointing to.<br /><br />A New Earth, I will say, is the most remarkable book I have ever read. It's a miracle, truly amazing and just exactly what we human beings need right now.

B000Q6GUW0|5.0|Over the last several years, with the proliferation of mindlessly redundant \\"Reality Shows\\" and the overall decline of network programming, much of television has become a vast wasteland.  Polluted with short-lived sitcoms and cheesy, often times over the top dramas - which painfully take themselves much too seriously, - most of today's TV programs are not only hard on the eyes but toxic for the mind. Showtime's \\"Dexter\\", based on the novels by Jeff Lindsay, is a refreshing drink of water, a real oasis! I have to say for the record, \\"this show rocks\\"... two thumbs up to \\"Dexter\\"!     Set in colorful Miami, the use of retro-style clothing, scratchy phonograph musica Cubana, and eye catching scenery, \\"Dexter\\" paints a refreshing picture of Miami, one not seen in other crime dramas sharing the same setting. Perhaps, the premise is a bit fanciful and unlikely - but HEY, it's a TV show.  The story and cast are top notch, accomplishing the task of pure escapism and entertainment. With each episode, I found myself captivated ... wanting to know, \\"what's next?\\"     The cast is well chosen and composed of talented individuals.  Very dynamic in their portrayals, their interactions are fluid and lively. When one thinks \\"serial killer\\", the image conjured is not Dexter Morgan. Although a self-described monster, Dexter is better seen as a \\"troubled hero\\". With his animated and impish facial gestures, coupled with narrated thoughts, Michael C. Hall delivers. His portrayal of Dexter is complex - conflicted, dark, quirky, warm-hearted, yet always likeable.     W.H. Reynolds  Raleigh, NC
B0013FSL0C|5.0|As a psychiatrist, I firmly believe that this series is without equal in the history of film portrayal of the work of a therapist. Despite a few, trivial criticisms one could level at this production, the work as a whole transcends the limits of the therapeutic \\"hour\\" and just as vividly portrays our limitations while bringing absolute realism to what it is like to be \\"In Treatment\\" from a number of perspectives. Yes, therapy is a complex process fraught with pitfalls and misadventures, but it is also a process that can and often does liberate and free the human spirit from the chains and fetters of the dark forces and shadows that plague us all until the final release that occurs at journey's end for each of us. This is the most captivating and compelling series that I have ever seen on television. For anyone contemplating entering therapy or struggling while in therapy or has been in therapy or is thinking about becoming/already is a therapist, psychiatrist, psychologist, or any mental health professional, this series is an absolute must see.
1603121196|5.0|...and well, a case could be made that the British write better than anyone else in the English language as I suppose the language was theirs first.  I almost cannot express how wonderful this book is.  So good in fact, that one should not waste time reading any other books by Forster if this is the first you have read, for one will surely be disappointed.  The language, the characters, the plot.  If you have seen the marvelous movie from some fifteen or so years ago with Anthony Hopkins and Emma Thompson you should still read the book.  The movie does do a better job with the Leonard Bast character, but to get the real full Forster experience of the Schlegels and Wilcoxes please do read the original.  I could not recommend this more, it is one of the best in our language.
B00133KFGW|5.0|Here is one movie you should not miss! It was so easy to get involved that you didn't want the movie to end. I was left with the feeling of \\"please tell me more\\".    It is sad to say movies like this rarely come along, so take advantage of buying this one. You will be glad you did!
