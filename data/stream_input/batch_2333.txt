B00B2V66VS|5.0|Hi my name is ashanti. I love this game. I love the characters. Temple run 2 is better than temple run 1. Temple run 2 has a lot of new helpers and starters. Temple fun 2 is a awesome fun and adventurous game because: 1.it is free 2.it's is fun 3.you don't have to use your own money.<br /><br />That's it for now. Bye. I hope this was helpful.
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|Though these books could be read read separately they are more enjoyable read as a trilogy. Throughout the books the main characters are shown in more complex detail which I found captivating. I also enjoyed the twists and turns the plot takes, could not put it down!

B0090P98Z4|5.0|I was expecting game that i was going to install when i got a hand on my kindle and that was it. No doubt about it. Killing multiple enemies with combo moves. High graphics and nice game play. I am keeping it until whole level ends. Best of all it's free. Deserves . Five star.

B007TNS6JI|1.0|Well first off it takes up about 1.5 gb. Of space which is ridiculous. Second its really boring and for all that space it takes up the graphics sucked.  Third when I tried to play multiplayer no one was on to play with me.  So overall dont get it even though its free
1400069181|4.0|The author of this book believes passionately in what he does, and that passion comes through in his writing. I wish I had his passion...and maybe that says something about my chosen business!<br /><br />Blake's journey is unique. I'm not sure many people will encounter the same challenges that he did, or solve them the same way, but that's what makes starting a business fun. Read this book for the inspirational story of how he succeeded each step of the way. In particular, his commitment to give away one pair of shoes for every pair that they sell is...unconventional, crazy, and SUCCESSFUL!<br /><br />Read this for inspiration. It's too short to contain too much general business advice, but there is plenty to learn from the Tom's example. Enjoyable read.

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I have had the Garmin 405 since 2008.  I am done with this device and recommend to anyone considering it to purchase something else.<br /><br />First off, I was very impressed with the bezel operation.  However, with the least bit of moisture, it is worthless.  Furthermore, if the battery charge connections in the back (contacting your wrist) get wet, the device will lock up, beep, blank out, or combination thereof.<br /><br />Eventually my watch began losing gps signal during runs.  Over the last 3 years, this has happened enough for me to send the watch back to Garmin to receive a refurbished unit back.  This cost me ~$85 each time.  Total of 3 times.  enough so that I could have already purchased a better quality watch.<br /><br />If you want extremely detailed reviews of garmin products, check out [...]  This guy really puts these devices through their paces and provides extremely thorough reviews.<br /><br />From Ray Makers reviews, my next watch will either be Garmin's 310, 610, or 910.  Don't waste your money on this product.  There's a reason why Garmin is discontinuing the 405.

B00B69UQJY|2.0|To give you some idea of my perspective, People Are People was my first DM CD circa 1985, and I've been with them ever since.  The 1990 Violator tour concert still stands among the top 2 or 3 shows I've ever attended.  As a college DJ in 1993, I ranked \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" as THE best track of all time, with \\"Everything Counts\\" and \\"Get the Balance Right\\" in the Top 15.  If I had to rank their studio albums from first to worst, it would go something like this:<br /><br />1. CONSTRUCTION TIME AGAIN (the environmental sensibilities are even more relevant and urgent today -- and disappointingly absent from more recent releases)<br />2. BLACK CELEBRATION (irresistible driving beat almost masks the bleakness of the title track; joy salvaged by \\"Here is the House\\" & \\"But Not Tonight\\")<br />3. VIOLATOR (still a great listen)<br />4. PEOPLE ARE PEOPLE (OK, more of a compilation, but a few new tracks were included)<br />5. ULTRA (perfect music for dusk's transition to darkness)<br />6. SOME GREAT REWARD (the lyrical intensity and musical creativity of \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\" is undeniable)<br />7. SONGS OF FAITH AND DEVOTION (can't get enough of the grinding bass laid down in \\"Walking in My Shoes\\")<br />8. A BROKEN FRAME (\\"The Sun & The Rainfall\\" -- so sweet and subtle)<br />9. MUSIC FOR THE MASSES (strong first half; forgettable second half redeemed by \\"Nothing\\")<br />9. SOUNDS OF THE UNIVERSE (the quintessential mixed bag, but never boring)<br />10. SPEAK & SPELL (happy and boppy thanks to Vince Clark, who soon left to form Erasure)<br />11. PLAYING THE ANGEL (standouts \\"Precious\\" & \\"Suffer Well\\" buffered with a lot of forgettable filler)<br />12. Can't get excited about EXCITER<br />13. Last and certainly least, this most recent release -- DELTA MACHINE<br /><br />Much of DELTA MACHINE is a somewhat new sound for the band, sort of electro-blues, but the lyrics are more unabashedly raunchy than ever.  I have no problem with a band that evolves over time, although it should be noted that DM in many respects has been more consistently true to its trademark sound than most long-running acts.  I agree with those who think that they have never been the same (read: as good) since Alan Wilder left to become Recoil.  I also think DM made a huge mistake in moving away from socially- and politically-relevant themes and instead focusing on \\"love\\" (more like LUST) songs.  Probably the best track on DELTA MACHINE is \\"Alone\\" -- a song more about friendship and redemption than a bawdy roll in the hay.  Overall, though, DELTA MACHINE conjures images of a seedy boudoir -- dusty maroon draperies, faded flower petals, and suspicious stains on the bedspread.  Ew, I need a shower.  DELTA MACHINE could very likely become the first DM CD to not stay in my collection.noted that DM in many respects has been more consistently true to its trademark sound than most long-running acts.

1400067820|5.0|I have Taleb's two other big philosophy books (Fooled by Randomness, The Black Swan --The Bed of Procrustes is a book of aphorisms) and found this one the most interesting and relatively easy to follow, despite its many digressions.  Like his other books, Taleb covers a huge amount of material as he applies his chosen topic (here antifragility) to a very wide range of concepts.  Antifragility is the idea that we gain and benefit from disorder and uncertainty -- the sinking of the Titanic made for safer ship voyages for example.  More to the present, the book talks about how we can learn and adapt from mistake/accidents in all settings, including business.<br /><br />The book really covers a lot of material and includes evolutionary biology, finance, politics, and quite interestingly medicine (and also exercise).  I found the book to be a difficult but rewarding read.  The difficulty comes in part from the depth and range of material covered but also the \\"nonlinearity\\" of Taleb's writing.  He tends to jump around a lot and has many very interesting digressions.  This, like his other books, is not something one plows through - there is a lot of stopping on the way for contemplation.  Still basic ideas are easy to follow.<br /><br />Highly recommended with many rewards - take your time to read it though!
0891419195|5.0|Eugene Sledge was a source for Ken Burns documentary and featured in the HBO Pacific series. His memoir tells of the guts without the phony glory or maudlin sentimentality and conveys the comradeship but also the stupidity of some decision-makers.

B00AKFG15S|4.0|'Best Kept Secret' is the best of the trilogy. After the first enjoyable book and the second disappointing book, which I felt was more of an interlude between first and third, I looked forward to the third. And was not disappointed as it was a really good read. I now look forward to the fourth in the series!

B007FJFDXS|5.0|I can't think of anything bad to say about this.  It gets very hard at times, but that's part of what makes it great.  The controls are simple and fluid, the graphics are just cubes, but can really set the tone of the level.  The techno soundtrack is perfect.  If this costed $20, it would be worth every cent.  It's just that awesome.

B0068MNNOE|5.0|It's a great blu-ray transfer; and it's a fascinating film about who actually wrote Shakespear's plays. I'm not going to bite into the controversy of whether he did/didn't/couldn't (even though I have my doubts), but ANONYMOUS offers much food for thought. As a production no expense has been spared and the settings have (what I take to be) an authentic look and feel about them, and director Roland Emmerich directs with great gusto and skill.This is one of the few contemporary films that I keep coming back to: it offers spectacle; information about the Elizbethan court; a way to view the plays; and one of history's greatest mysteries. For me this disc is money well spent.
B007MAETA8|4.0|Born and Raised is a good cd, but compared to some of his past work, it's not quite as good.
0345803493|4.0|James pens a suspenseful erotic tale with \\"Fifty Shades Darker.\\" Businessman Christian Grey falls to pieces when Ana leaves him. Can he earn her love despite his past?<br /><br />The novel opens with Anastasia committed to her choice of leaving Christian, but soon she challenges herself. Despite Christian's dark background, the attraction between them is undeniable. Dare Anastasia give him her heart once she learns his all-consuming dark past?<br /><br />James delves into the depths of Christian's demons and splays them before Ana for her to accept or reject. James' writing is easy to read, but her style can be jarring at times as the story is told in the present tense through Ana's perspective. The characterization is the best part of the novel. Christian bares his dark, haunted soul to Ana. The story challenges the reader to hope like Ana, that Christian can let his demons go.<br /><br />50 Shades Darker is an erotic romance. The sexual scenes are intense, and intended  for a mature audience. While intimacy grows the trust between Christian and Ana, the sexual scenes feel excessive at times. This book is not for those readers who would easily be offended by the graphic sexual content.<br /><br />Overall, the novel strips away barriers and challenges readers to go outside their comfort zone with Ana and Christian. \\"50 Shades Darker\\" will leave you breathless and on the edge of your seat, daring the reader to believe that the seeds of love can bloom in darkness.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Not quite as fast paced as the trailer makes it out to be, but, unbelievable true story here ... most of the actors outside of Ben Affleck are no names, however, they have great chemistry with one another and you truly get wrapped into the intensity of the situation they are dealing with.

B00AZNEW5G|1.0|This film is essentially a revenge western along the lines of \\"the searchers\\" or \\"true grit\\". Its problem is that it is by turns, long, boring and ultimately pointless. A good portion of the film consists of repetitive scenes of torture followed by capsule terrorists attacks. The film keeps hammering on the same obvious points for what seems like hours. Unlike most revenge westerns, it has no greater point to make than to just grind out the motions of the characters.<br /><br />The center of the film is Maya. Having no life and being passive-aggressive does not make for an interesting character. Most of the other people in the film are reduced to ciphers. The seal team, for example, is reduced to being treated like a pick-up basketball team of dumb jocks. We don't see their prepartions. We don't see the extensive planning, rehearsals and training that are well known to have went into the mission. Rather than anything real, we are given dumb unrealistic scenes like the one when they go to \\"area 51\\" to pick up their stealth helicopters. The politicians and hierarchy of the intelligence agencies are completely absent as well. The chain of command is maya, weak boss, obnoxous boss and apparently the president. Rather than reality, we are presented with a view of the world through the eyes of an angry child.<br /><br />The film also has the sense of being designed by committee with an objective of not offending anyone. The film avoids controversy by often trying to stay on all sides of an issue. This is particularly true of the torture scenes which have been designed seemingly to give everyone what they want. Of course the lack of any point of view on the torture makes the sheer volume of torture presented in the film all the more pointless.<br /><br />As with the worst sort of propaganda, the film gets people worked up about an issue thats in the past (torture) while not saying one word about what it was replaced with. If you wanted realism, post-torture \\"Maya\\" would have been shown spending most of her time writing up death lists for the \\"star chamber\\" to approve. What replaced torture is death by drone. But \\"responsible\\" people can't talk about that. At least not in a major motion picture.<br /><br />The raid is the opposite of thrilling. I don't find anything particularly dramatic about POV soldiers kicking down doors and going through rooms full of women and children to ultimately shoot up a bedroom.<br /><br />I suppose the film will appeal to the crowd who likes ultra-detailed police procedurals. But I've never liked that sort of thing myself. Its all the worse here because its a \\"lone\\" character procedural. Maya does everything. Maya is everywhere. When the team returns from Pakistan, almost nobody is there except for Maya. They don't even give us the natural epilogue of the burial at sea of OBL.<br /><br />The film is around 160 minutes but it feels like four hours. After a while, you could see the terrorism scenes coming from a mile away. But after a while, anything other than repetitive torture scenes seemed like a positive.<br /><br />The film is badly written and badly directed. I can't say anything bad about Chastain's performance because it appears that she was given nothing to work with in terms of the script. How a film this bad was nominated for the highest awards is beyond me. There were points to be made about revenge in a film like this but the film managed to touch not one of them.

B004LOMB2Q|2.0|First the good things.  There are Evernote apps available in just about all the app stores, including Amazon, so it's easy to find and install.  It works well with notes you create, and doesn't require installing an application on your computer to view and manage them.<br /><br />The bad news is it does a terrible job with attachments to notes.  The equation editor on my Kindle Fire HD can be backed up to Evernote, but it changes the file name to an internal Evernote GUID, and even changes the file extension to something completely random.  Their competitor Dropbox has no problem with this, so I would recommend using that if you're backing up or sharing anything other than simple text notes.  You'll need to install it from the Dropbox web site because the Android app isn't in Amazon's app store, but it's worth the extra step.

B004JK61K0|5.0|I use this as the primary email app on my Kindle Fire HD to access my GMail account, and it works perfectly.  I use it in preference to the built-in email client because it handles sending attachments without any issue, whereas the Kindle Fire version will sometimes report an attachment of as small as a few hundred bytes as being beyond the 5MB limit (I didn't even know there was a limit - what's the point of that).

B008MWBY6W|5.0|There's not a lot to say here: This is a big, solid, spacious camera case that holds everything you'd need to carry for your photography needs. It's also pretty handy for other things. The construction is solid and sturdy. The zippers all work well and don't catch.<br /><br />The bag itself isn't too heavy or big, but your needs may vary. I find it to be just about perfect for my needs. There's a lot of space here, and it's managed well.<br /><br />For the price, you can't go wrong. Give it a shot.

B005LAIHZE|4.0|Rating 3.5/5<br />Abraham Lincoln Vampire Hunter is directed by Timur Bekmambetov(Wanted,Daywatch,Nightwatch).<br /><br />Based on the book(which I have not read).It is a time piece during the civil war and the young days of young Abraham Lincoln.He befriends a vampire hunter,Henry Sturges(Devil's Double,Captain America) and teaches him the art of slaying vampires with an axe.After all the twilight movies and the crappy Blade Trinity.ALVH brings back the violence and gore in vampire slaying.The best performance is probably by Adam(Rufus Sewell).He is a great charming villian who cannot be stopped,along with his lover Vadoma(Erin Wasson).Benjamin Walker might look the part of Lincoln but he has trouble carrying the movie as a leading man.While there's downtime from Lincoln growing up from a kid to an adult it is rather slow,but he moves to Springfield to hunt down vampires that Henry has appointed him so he can find his mother's killer.

B00AB0Z88S|2.0|I only bought this thing because the ad was calling it the next Avatar.  Uh, not even close. Putting that masterpiece's title and the name of this...movie in the same sentence together is criminal.<br /><br />Trying to think what I like about this movie.  The glow in the dark water and the cool whale breaching.  I love tigers and it hurt my eyes watching even an animated tiger slowly starve (or nearly starve to death).  The zebra would have been screaming in agony and should have been destroyed.  At once.  Instead of being put through even more trauma by the rocking pitching motion of the boat.<br /><br />Oh, but that would be realism...showing the resulting pain that would come from a broken leg.<br /><br />Criminy. Sorry.  I could be on a deserted island with nothing but a DVD player and this movie lying there, and I'd still rather play tick tack toe in the sand than watch this film a second time.

B004TI5N38|3.0|If one were a Baldacci fan, ZERO would possibly be considered great.  I have found it duller than dull but slogged through it.  It did succeed in putting me to sleep and (mercifully) the chapters are short. I suppose I felt compelled to finish it since I'd bought it. A major portion of the plot begged credibility.  Grisham and others can pull unlikely scenarios off but in my opinion, Baldacci can't.  He needs to read some Hemmingway and learn to economize so that he doesn't bore his audience to death.

0062082353|5.0|well written, couldn't put it down. Read the book in two days. His style of writing gives you a feeling of being there.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|I bought this for my wife's kindle and it works great.  A sturdy case with the flip over cover that protects the screen when not in use.  The straps stretches easily  and keeps the cover firmly in place.  Also nice if you want to have the kindle stand -alone for watching movies, etc.  It does not block any of the ports for power or USB connection.  Definitely recommend.

B009IEXKXI|4.0|I liked the book but the profanity was not necessary nor appreciated. I would have given it 5 stars had it not been for the inappropriate language.

B00BVMXBVG|5.0|Orphan Black on BBC America is created by John Fawcett (Xenia Warrior Prince, Lost Girl) and Graeme Manson (Flashpoint, Endgame) and centers around a troubled single mother Sarah, played beautifully by the beautiful Tatiana Maslany (Defendor, The Vow). Her range in acting is evident immediately, her eyes smolder with intensity and with fear and anger and sadness, and whatever else the scene may require. Almost immediately we are thrown in to Sarah's plight and just as confused as she is. A strong series opening episode, albeit confusing, I think that is the point. This show is told from Sarah's view point and the idea is to figure out the plot of the show with Sarah as she figures it out for herself.<br /><br />*Episode Review*<br /><br />\\"Natural Selection\\" written by John Fawcett and Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett starts out with Sarah, a street smart estranged single mother witnessing the suicide of a woman on a train platform in Canada who happens to look exactly like her. Felix played by Jordan Gavaris (Degrassi: The Next Generation) plays Sarah's foster brother who helps her escape her life by assuming the newly dead doppelgangers identity. In an attempt to take over this persons life and emptying her bank account, Sarah inadvertently inherits all the problems that come along with taking over someone elses identity. The denouement of the episode answers some lingering questions and also flips everything on it head and poses even more questions with a very intense awesome action scene that comes way out of left field from an otherwise very methodically paced episode. For a first episode, I was immediately drawn in and intrigued, this show is a great pairing with Doctor Who on the Supernatural Saturday's on BBC America. Side note, there was a decent amount of nudity in this episode which I thought was great because I think Tatiana Maslany is sexy. Some may think this was unnecessary but I think it was meant to show how Sarah uses her sexuality to her advantage, and how quick she can think on her toes. So this show is not super kid friendly, but I think adults will enjoy this sexy, smart thriller. Can't wait to see where the next 9 episodes take this show.<br /><br />\\"Instinct\\" written by Graeme Manson and directed by John Fawcett has our main character Sarah on the run from an assassin who killed the German at the end of last weeks episode \\"Natural Selection\\". Sarah buries the body, gets a call from another identical who tells her to go to the Germans hotel room and retrieve her briefcase. Meanwhile Sarah continues her con as Beth, (the dead identical who's identity Sarah has taken over) and has realized that Beth's police partner Art, has taken the $75,000 that Sarah emptied from Beth's bank account (kind of confusing I know). After using info taken from the German's briefcase, Sarah tracks down another identical, Alison, who happens to be a soccer mom. They set up a rendezvous for a later time, Sarah brings Felix as her back up and more secrets and questions are answered and at the same time more questions are posed. This show is still very intriguing and I am very curious what direction this show is going to go, because at this point it could go in a lot of different directions.<br /><br />\\"Variation Under Nature\\" written by Graeme Manson and directed by David Frazee (Continuum, Flashpoint) starts with Sarah face to face with Alison and Cosima, who waste no time breaking the news that they are all clones and being killed off. Cosima will give Sarah more details when Sarah gives her the Germans brief case. Meanwhile Sarah still has to play at being Beth so Art will give her the money he took from her that she emptied from Beth's account. Sarah finds herself reinstated as an on duty officer after passing the hearing from an accidental shooting. Soon Sarah is answering a call with Art and finds herself at the exact site she buried the assassinated German, not realizing it was an active quarry site. The body ischewed up but prints have been found, and Cosima maybe her only help to get her out of this tight spot. Sarah gives Cosima the case and Cosima tells Sarah she has to keep pretending to be Beth so that they can use police intel to stay safe and dig for clues. While at the police station, a mysterious caller (the killer targeting the clones) gives Art some vague info about his activities. Sarah deletes some incriminating pictures off of the Evidence Tech's computer. Afterward she meets with Mrs. S. to set up a visit with her daughter Kira. Meanwhile Art pieces together more of the Germans murder while at the murder scene. Felix gets some great and comedic screen time in this episode. We find out that the $75,000 that Sarah took from Beth's bank account didn't exactly belong to her, which makes it even more imperative that Sarah gets it back from Art. Sarah and Art get a lead on a stolen motorcycle that may be a match to tire tracks at the scene of the Germans murder, this lands Sarah and Art in the line of fire. Like the first episode, this episode ends with some intense action. This show is shaping up nicely and answering enough questions to keep it interesting and leaving enough unanswered to keep it intriguing. We find out who the killer is in this episode, and it's heavy man. Can't wait to see what happens in next weeks episode \\"Effects of External Conditions\\".<br /><br />\\"Effects of External Conditions\\" written by Karen Walton (Ginger Snaps, Flashpoint) and directed by Grant Harvey (Gone, Heartland) starts with the killer cleaning the wound Sarah inflicted on her. A young boy walks in on her and she grabs his hand and walks him into the bathroom where she is cleaning up and closes the door behind them, presumably to kill him. Meanwhile Sarah and Alison talk about the events that just happened. Sarah gives Alison her $75,000 back and tells her about her plan to run off with it but gives it back because she too has a family. After a text from Art, Sarah meets him at a crime scene where the Killer ditched her bike. Luckily the little boy was not murdered. When they ask the boy what the Killer looked like, he points to Sarah/Beth. The Killer left a clue in the form of a cootie catcher. Sarah struggles again to get along with Mrs. S. who threatens to not let Sarah see her daughter Kira if she misses their meeting. Back at the police station they reveal that the body found at the quarry was killed by gunshot. Sarah/Beth gets a phone call from the Killer who wants to meet. The Killer knows she is not Beth and threatens to expose Sarah's lie if she doesn't meet with her. The Killer infiltrates the police station and learns how close they are to catching her. Sarah, Art and other officers search a place they believe the Killer maybe. Sarah realizes she won't be able to make the meeting with Mrs. S so she asks Felix to get Alison to pretend to be her and meet with Mrs. S. and Kira. When Sarah and Art get back to the station, they realize the Killer has been there. The scenes between Felix and Alison are great, extremely funny. Tatiana Maslany's ability to play multiple characters gets better and better each episode. Paul shows up after the Killer called him and pretended to be Sarah. The killer calls Sarah again at the station, who still wants to meet. Sarah finds a video on her computer that the Killer made, confessing to the murder of Maggie Chen that Beth \\"accidentally\\" killed. Alison and Felix arrive at Mrs. S.'s, meanwhile Art and Angela seem to question Sarah's story about the Killer. Kira knows that Alison is not he mother Sarah, while Sarah follows the trail to meet with the Killer. Unlike my review which seems to be all over the place, the show isn't. The first episode was a bit confusing but as the show progresses and questions are answered, this show has great pacing. It's tense and intriguing. I cannot wait for next weeks episode \\"Conditions of Existence\\".<br /><br />\\"Conditions Of Existence\\" written by Alex Levine (Flashpoint, Stargate SG-1) and directed by T.J. Scott (Spartacus: War of The Damned, and the forthcoming Black Sails on STARZ which looks awesome) focuses on Sarah, Alison and Cosima realizing that they are being watched as some part of ongoing experiment. Sarah suspects Paul is watching her, Alison suspects her husband has been assigned to watch her, and Cosima is unsure of who is looking after her. Sarah thanks Alison for filling in as her so she can now pick her daughter Kira up from school and take her home to Mrs. S's. As Sarah probes further into what Paul does for a living, she triggers him to start putting together the pieces of his own puzzle because of her strange behavior. Alison finds a case in the garage that her husband rips from her hands to keep her from opening. Things are getting tense for these two couples as secrets are starting to bubble to the service. Cosima seems to have met a new friend in the lab, or has she? After Sarah visits Paul's work to bug it, her and Felix listen in on what is being said, here some big news is revealed. This leads to a phone call to Sarah where Paul plays a move to convince her to meet him, this is where things get really tense. Meanwhile Vic spots Alison at a shopping center after getting the hurt put on him by some local drug thugs. Thinking Alison is Sarah, he confronts her and demands to know what she did with the cocaine she stole from him and tells her the thugs will kill him if he cannot furnish the $15,000 he now owes them.  He is promptly pepper sprayed and tased which is hilarious. A lot of big stuff happens this episode, some major plot points are revealed, there are some good laughs and sentimental moments as well. And excellently balanced episode and well-crafted all around. Next week's episode \\"Variations Under Domestication\\" looks insane, and looks as if a lot of big stuff is going to go down.t a crime scene where the Killer ditched her bike.

B0006PV5U8|5.0|I've had my doubts about Heifetz -- and I don't mean to suggest that I'm alone. Heifetz divided opinion for half a century, between those who believed him to represent the acme of violinistic musicality and others who felt that he evinced a sore lack of emotional involvement in his artistry. I personally incline to the second of these opinions, but not altogether. It may be that Heifetz responds more deeply to some music. It seems that particular works affect him, rather than general categories of music. For example, his recordings of Elgar and Rozsa, Bruch's Scottish Fantasy and the SIbelius Concerto seem to me to bring out the best of the musician, rather than just the virtuoso.<br />So now I have mentioned Sibelius, I still have to bring up the virtuosic feature of his playing first. All other recordings I own, evince signs of stress in the opening cadenza; and even in some of the best digital recordings, the fiddle can sound painfully hard. Not here. Whatever his secret was, Heifetz has no trouble surmounting the impediments to a clean delivery. The same considerations apply, naturally to the two other longish episodes when the violin holds the fort. However, by itself this would not move me -- his tone is the same in Beethoven, Brahms and Mendelssohn, where it leaves me quite cold.<br />This is the point where words should come to the rescue -- where the crucial issue comes up. What does this man communicate? And all I can say (as my very subjective impression) that Heifetz just manages to get under the skin of this music in a way that none other can. This is not a technical issue, because it has relevance to the soul of the work. It strikes me that Heifetz projects the yearning, the reaching out of the violin to your heart, but also the gloom that intervenes every so often, with rare fidelity. The slow movement is songful and passionate in an unobtrusive way (too many performers become over-rhetorical here); the \\"polonaise for a polar bear\\", as one critic called it, is discharging with flying colours and really quite exciting.<br />I am of the view that with music it is impossible to call any performance on record \\"the best\\". It always annoys me when I see those silly words in the heading of a review, as if we were dealing with a well-made chair or a new model motor car. And so I will refrain here, except to say that I have not ever heard a recorded performance \\"better\\" than this.<br />The sound is very good, too; and the Chicago Symphony discharge their duty with accustomed precision, even though it was Hendl rather than Reiner in charge that day.<br />When this album first hit the market on LP, in 1960, you paid full price for just the Sibelius. Today you get Prokofiev and Glazunov thrown in. So lucky we are today!<br />The Prokofiev is a \\"typical\\" Heifetz performance -- meaning, undoubtedly a superior rendering, but not as conspicuously sympathetic as the Sibelius. But it will not leave you asking for \\"better\\", only (perhaps) for \\"different\\". I frankly don't love this concerto so much as to look for another (I also have Milstein playing it, nowhere near as good). The third concerto here, by Glazunov, fares very badly. To judge by his playing, Heifetz must really dislike it. It is a tuneful, elegant and sad little oeuvre, but Heifetz rushes through as if he couldn't wait to get it over and done with.<br />No matter. Think of it as a fill-up. The other two works are worth having whatever the price.

B005KELQEU|5.0|Since we travel a lot, this is a very handy item to have. I don't eat or drink around my Kindle.
B00BCZU8WM|2.0|I have not heard the album yet, but I will comment on the CD.  It's QUITE similar in name and design to one from a favorite band of mine - Saga.  Check out their latest release from August 2012.  Coincidence?
B009NH6AOQ|5.0|Love the picture on the dvd case too.  This is the second season and I already received my first season...I now have my pre-ordered request in for the third season.  I love the show and love my dvd's.  I've also ordered 2 more of the second season for my adult kids...they are hooked also.
B000S1M9LY|5.0|It is rare to find satisfaction of such high order on a novel these days. While I admit to skimming a section on the minutiae of adolescent tennis competitions, most of the riffs are hilariously entertaining. Vivid descriptions of family life either in drug rehab or an unconventional upper class home simply amaze.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|I have season 1 and season 2 I loce masterpiece classic this is something you can rewatch serval times. recommend it.
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I found this to be very uplifting, and confirms what I have always believed. I found this to be a masterly job well done. Kathryn Punton
B002RT2BXQ|5.0|It seems that each time I watch this movie (just once every few years) I appreciate it more.  I'm grateful to Any Rand and the case for freedom that she continually strove to make in her work.  Are material accomplishments the pinnacle of existence?  Certainly not.  But living according to one's highest sense of right, seeing the insanity of collectivism, and resisting the incessant social pressure to conform and appease -- I believe THAT may be the pinnacle of all human achievement, reachable by every living individual, regardless of how it is outwardly expressed.  This movie is a testament to that grand, eternal idea.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|Same with this one. His voice is unbelievable. I have always been a fan of Josh Groban, and I still am. I liked how he mixed in some old songs with the new. Kathryn Punton
B006LSZECO|1.0|I started reading this book while on a trip to China and it started out strong (so strong that despite desperately wanting to get back home I almost missed my flight because I was so engrossed in the book).  This book, which starts out believably, deteriorates into this fantastical cat and mouse game that is beyond implausible. It's like the author made a bet to see how long she could string people along. NO ONE could believe this story.  The ending of this book is beyond unsatisfying I actually felt robbed of my time and money when I finished it.  I read this book in December, it's now April and I'm writing the review because I haven't forgotten how much I hated it.  Save your money.
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I think this was very well done. It appealed to my artistic sense and to my Scottish heritage. It was wonderful. I see it got the Oscar for best animation. Very nice. Kathryn Punton
B004NELBPC|5.0|This is the place for everyone to get your fix of political stories and also many other types of information
B009AMANBA|5.0|I found this to be very inspiring. I have always admired Abraham Lincoln, and Spielberg and Lewis both did a good job.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Who can go a day without checking facebook of course.  Facebook is Facebook.  Not much more to say about it.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|it is an awsome off the huck  game you would love how much it takes your mind away<br /><br />by scout
1451695195|5.0|Ive read other books relating people's near-death experiences<br />this is different because the author is a well-respected neurosurgeon who, by his own admission,<br />did NOT believe in an &#34;afterlife.&#34;  By his own admission, what happened to  him, what he experienced,<br />should not have been possible. . . but it DID happen. Everyone should read this. Riveting. Inspiring.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is fun.I love how there are new themes every once and a while.I love the themes they come up with. The new themes are just like your in the place it takes place.
B004J09ONG|5.0|Watched this thinking it was a documentary. I was pleasantly surprised! Such a beautiful film and I truly enjoyed watching it. Amazing to see how an animal could really have such a close bond with its owner.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|Very good keyboard alternative to the hit-or-miss Touchwiz stock keyboard. Occasionally the predictions can be off the mark, though. I highly recommend you try the free version first, at least.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Yeah; love the program.  Downton Abbey gets 5 stars and I wholeheartedly recommend it.  But Amazon Streaming has been a huge disappointment for me.  I have a very fast (50mbps) internet connection, and I can stream HD content from all of the other streaming services (iTunes, NetFlix, HBO Go, etc.) just fine.  But video from Amazon frequently stalls, stutters, loses audio quality, etc.  The only thing I use Amazon Streaming for anymore is to watch the first 5 minutes of free programing I've never seen, to see if I like it.  If I do like it, then I go find it somewhere else.
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|This book has been incredibly helpful. It really opens up a new way of thinking. A must read for those who want to make life easier on and better fir themselves.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|The first two books are by far two of the best books I have read in along time. One more
B007REV4T8|5.0|This new Bond story is one of the best in awhile.  Daniel Craig is great although there are some inconsistencies, but the surprises make up for it.  A good addition to the Bond series.
B00AO2P3GA|4.0|When i play multiplayer and i goto local wifi and create a game my son cant find that game at all, the issue is the same if he creates the game i cannot find it when searching! We both have kindle fire 2nd gen. When my other son creates a match using his galaxy tab 2 7.0 both me and my son can find it straight away & play no problem. After searching on the net it seems to be a widespread problem, 2 kindle fires 2nd gen cannot connect with each other to play multiplayer over local wifi, \\"FACT\\"!!!!!!!! Please fix as the game is worth 5 stars all day long apart from this (for us) major issue as its cost us the best part of £10 between us.
B0050SYS5A|1.0|Bought this because I have a small space to play with kinect.  After carefully following instructions on how to snap on to kinect and also what seemed like an eternity to calibrate, all that resulted was a black screen in the corner where the kinect sensor showed video.  I recalibrated 3 or 4 times with same results.  This product does not work at all.  Hopefully Kinect will be upgraded to negate the purchase of such a device but for now I rather do without it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I couldn't put the book down, and then with an ending like that!!! It was completely shocking!  I would love to read a sequel if there is one....
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game sucks....no I'm just kidding this game is totally awesome and I would recommend it to anyone that likes Temple Run they are pretty alike but personally I think Subway Surfers is much much better!!!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I couldn't put the first book down. Very erotic but with a good underlining love story, the ens of 3rd book was a bit of a letdown

0307383415|2.0|Not an biograpy but a book about the theory and background of his motives for doing the things he does.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Where has Weir been? He is a gifted writer and should be much better known. I am going to look for more of his books.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Really enjoyed reading this book. I got my copy as soon as it came out, and then had it read in 2 days.
B00979CS50|5.0|As Neil would say, you can really \\"smell the horse\\" on this one.  Neil has been criticized for self indulgent ramblings in every album he has done with Crazy Horse, going back to Everybody Knows This Is Nowhere, and if that side of Neil doesn't appeal to you, this album is definitely not for you.  But for my money, I'd rather listen to half an hour of Neil Young noodling on his guitar with Crazy Horse in the background than most of what passes for rock music these days.  Maybe I'm biased, and I admit that I'm 40 years past the twenty-something demographic that the mainstream music industry targets, but this is everything I'd have wanted from a new Neil Young album, and more.  Highly recommended.
B0034G4P8A|5.0|Eu sempre digo que o que é bom volta! Então das manhas de sábado acordávamos as seis da manha para assistir os desenhos ainda em tv preto e branco, assisto e recomendo.
B003ES61EE|5.0|Every well equipped camera bag has to have materials to keep the camera and lenses clean if you're shooting SLRs with interchangeable lenses.<br /><br />This little \\"pen\\" is easy to store, very functional, and very easy and intuitive to use, and at only about 7 bucks is cheap insurance to keep your camera system producing the sharpest possible images.<br /><br />Well done!
B003PIUC02|5.0|Mostra uma roma devassa, e uma sociedade de prazeres e morte, agradeço a chance de lembrar e retomar o Spartacus como referencia histórica, sem esquecer que em termos gerais tudo passa a ser ficção quando não ha contextualização.<br />Boa serie, assista se puder, ou se não for fraco gladiador!
B00021HBGS|5.0|Kids in my household love playing with this set in the tub (boys and girls age group 2 - 9 years  old).
B004EPZ07U|5.0|Um bom filme de ficção, ate lembrei dos velhos tempos de leitura de gibis, nas sextas feiras, na biblioteca do colegio, um bom entretenimento, recomendo.
0307960471|4.0|Let's face it - \\"Harry Hole\\" is a horrible name for anybody, even for a rough and tumble homicide detective.  Hopefully it's just a lousy translation.<br /><br />I won't give anything away here, but if you liked \\"The Snowman\\" and can get past calling someone Hairy Hole, then this is a taut thriller and you should just read it.
B003EYVXT6|5.0|Quero ver se vão produzir a continuação, com  os mesmos recursos técnicos, e os bons atores, mas certamente um bom entretenimento.
B00AA0TZTW|1.0|Not to good. If Jimi thought it was good he would hav e released it 45 years ago. People, and Hell & Angels is not very good..
B005IZLPMY|5.0|Um dos meus brinquedos prediletos de infância, o Capitão America o escudo e a moto, fazer o que?; Se o que é bom volta

B005G4TJI4|5.0|É mas eu sou suspeito, ainda tenho alguns dos meus Transformers da adolescência, e com certeza não perco a chance de ver minhas referencias de ação e aventura de infância.<br />Quando o bumblebee ainda era um fusca, tudo bem ficou melhor afinal agora é um Camaro.
B0087EACJK|4.0|Firstly I taught that this game is absolutely too easy but going further on higher levels it gets really challenging.
B000ICXQS8|5.0|Director show us a kind of noble and true love in human. The end is great which last in my memorary long time.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|I bought this so my wife could watch it at her leisure.  It is already one of the best series I have ever seen.  It's right up there with Deadwood and The Wire.
B000W9399S|4.0|Really enjoyable read but you will have to be a sci fi / fantasy fan. If so you'll love this book.
B00AQKEPMI|4.0|We bought this because 1) we had not yet seen it; 2) we have a 3d tv but there are very few good 3d movies out there; and, 3) a local actually wrote and produced this and we wanted to support it.  While the story line is a good one, the 3d aspect of it did not live up to our expectations.  We enjoyed watching as a family, however.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a fun and wonderful app I love how it changes places it's really fun to play to!!!! I love this game
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|Its Indiana Jones on Blue Ray what more can you ask for. If your an Indiana Jones Fan you will love it.

B0086700CM|5.0|This is a fun game and any age can play it. It's not so easy that you get bored..would recommend
B004UID2LC|1.0|Do not get this app it is a waste of your time and  effort I am glad it is free.
B0063GORYU|5.0|The graphics and instruction were great. It is enjoyable and easy to use . I spend a lot of time on airplanes trips using it and passing the time.
B002XMGJHG|5.0|If you like Europe like I do get this song you will love this song. great in concert trust me.
B002VPE1WK|1.0|It's a really nice bag, but way too small especially for someone my size. If you're 200 lbs or more...do not purchase this bag, trust me. I read it and didn't believe it and had to learn the hard way. I returned it with no problems.
B008FRFN7A|5.0|If you have a all in one printer from HP it is a app to have for any one do it.
B00AZL3PBK|3.0|This game is fun but it is also really really irritating and hard.  You always die at the begaining of the level. Also these annoying ads pop up every where. This game is not for kids under the age of six, due to irritation (they might throw your device or break it) and nasty adds (blood, zombies, and Gore)  This game is manet a two and a half because of that.
B008M87GJK|5.0|If you like new like me this is a app to have. Story are easy to read and under stand.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is brilliant, really addictive. My daughter loves it and is much better than me. It has been great helping her with her hand,eye co-ordination. I would highly recommend this game as it is a great time filler.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|This app should be on the Kindle Fire. It is easy to use and under stand and the lay out is good.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really. Like this game. I love the updates.<br />I have tagbot, Lucy, and fresh. I am almost able to get the rocker.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|Great app to have and understand. Easy to use and pleasing to the eyes to see. Get the app trust me.
1616550414|5.0|My 7 year old Grandson requested this book. It looks a little advanced for him, but it is very comprehensive and I imagine he will spend hours lookin at it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|If you have EBay is a must have. Everything you can do on computer you can do on the Fire
B00BFUC8RC|5.0|it is the most amazing game I have. you would love it to. I told my friend about it and she got it to. we both play it together on the bus.
B00BUVPIRS|5.0|This game is literally pocket skyrim. It has everything from bandits to enchantment s. This is a great game for all pocket rpg enthusiasts.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Spoiler ... a little bit.<br />Winter of the World is like a pack of ketchup. Some people have to have it for their burger or fries and some can do without it. Fall of Giants was a delightful read compared to Winter of the World. I suppose this book suffers from the Middle Child Syndrome. Being the second in a trilogy, I felt like it was a necessary book if only to get to the third book. So I must admit that I am a little bit annoyed anout how some of Fall of the Giants' nobler characters were treated in this pack of ketchup.<br />But, thank you, Mr. Follett, you are still, by far, one of the best out there.
B00AEK9BKQ|4.0|I chose it for Helen Hunt's nude scenes. But I found it to be a touching movie about a disabled man getting to experience having sex for the first time in his life. I would recommend this movie.
0765356139|4.0|I devoured this book and enjoyed it a lot--until I got near the end. One of the characters has a piece of information in front of him and then for no plausible reason doesn't comprehend it. Yeah, the author tries to give us a reason, but it wasn't adequate to convince me. I felt duped at the end. Too bad, after loving the book.
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|I use it on Kindle Fire.<br />-the music is echoing itself. I had to turn it off completely.<br />-can't play if you use your 5 lives. To play more you have to wait for them to regenerate (at least 7 minutes) , or ask your fb friends to send you some. I don't want a game I can't play whenever I please. I find myself checking every couple minutes, if the lives have regenerated. Frustrating.
B000006OS2|5.0|I know that this one is more fun than most of his films but, I just love it! I look forward to watching it another 50 times!
B0092MKFIY|4.0|I read an interview of the group, where they were flattered to be compared to the Killers. But they do have a great vocal quality and similar sound. I very much look forward to more albums from the group and see what they come up with. The Killers are my favorite band, and Imagine Dragons has a good start with Night Visions.They have been getting great exposure with recent movie soundtracks, and tv commercials. All in all good album, and each song has quality lyrics and a separate sound. I certainly recommend Night Visions.

0316123587|4.0|I enjoy this book. The pictures show the Glee kids at various times during the show. Best of all - it drives my co-workers crazy who do not appreciate Glee as much as I do.
B008OOYALE|5.0|game rox I like how u can help and get help from your neighbors if u need something like a map or gold
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great app and game. This is a must buy. It is free but, they ask you to update the app so, Don't mind about that. Buy this!
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Definitely leaves open plot lines but all and all a great read.  Kept me up late at night wanting to read \\"just a little bit more\\"
B007HC3LHS|4.0|I enjoyed the book. It was very exciting in spots and frustrating in others. You really felt sad for Catherine. As soon as she met Stuart you kind of knew all was going to be alright.
0802473156|5.0|Bought 5...for shower gifts.  A great book for any couple at any age.  Wish I had it when I were first married.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very entertaining. Wish I could get more players. But that is the reason you wAnt to play more.
B0091REZMW|5.0|I really enjoy the game me but I don't like being forced to need jems. it would be perfect if u could win them more readily.
B004LROUNG|4.0|If you liked  his other lawyers you will like this one. Nothing much new, but an enjoyable quick beach read.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|I use to feel guilty about stealing from my favorite artist. I already knew what I'd make would be some how different because I made it but there was always a bit of gilt there. I now understand how &#34;stealing&#34; from everyone and everything I love can make my art better. Thanks for that!
B002L5GQGY|5.0|From the opening notes to the final chord, this disc shows the best of Bonamassa as well as his very talented band. Sound and camera work are both excellent as well. Some of his best songs are on these 2 discs and the 2 drummers really bring out additional excitement. Awesome disc set!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Great series overall! Nothing to complain about! I'd definitely read it again without a doubt! Once again, very good read.
B005CRQ4GU|3.0|It won't let me get past page 34so I have to write a review to get past it so yeah
B007IXWL2C|4.0|The last in the series is okay, I feel like it could've ended at the second book, but hey....still a happy ending.
B002QRWJA4|3.0|I could not watch this online.  I ordered the DVD and received a free online view of it.  I tried watching the free online video and was unable to do so.  The error message was ambiguous and the &#34;help tab&#34; was completely unhelpful.  The 3 star rating above is for the &#34;help&#34;, not the movie.  I should receive the DVD in the next few days and will watch the movie at that time, so this is no big deal.  However, it was still a frustrating experience.
B0029LHW68|5.0|I bought this cd for my mother, who is a huge fan. She loved the cd. I don't know if she still listens to it. I bought it for her like 4 years ago.
1401937268|5.0|these cards are awesome at first i was thrown off from the fact that they switched the minor arcana for elements (instead of swords, air) because i was so used to the rider waite deck but once you get used to it and get the system down its awesome. the deck is bodered in silver and altogether lovely. a great choice!
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This is a great book.  Page turner for sure.  A must read.  Just when you think it's about to end.... watch out!
B007ZYJT1U|5.0|Peter Mullen can pull off true anger in a movie with more realism then anyone else ever on film.<br />Ever see Session 9? His roles seem real and very gritty and he brings disturbing life to them.<br />However all the acting was very good in this movie. The story has a disturbing twist of fate<br />that makes you think, life just isn't fair.
B00021HBGS|5.0|I recently purchased these for a 2 years old birthday gift. The theme was 'bath time' and I included this and the kids love it! Nice durable storage and the pieces work great in the water!
B002LC8HF0|5.0|Very intense conclusion to a great series.  Never even heard of Brandon Sanderson until he took over The Wheel of Time after Robert Jordan died, but he has quickly become one of my favorite authors.
146500632X|5.0|Bought this for Christmas for my daughter.<br />She was extremely happy with it.<br />Large dates and good pictures.<br />Would recommend for 1D fans.
B004VMVTNU|4.0|I have tried others &amp; this one seems to be the best one out there. My only suggestion... eliminate settings under &quot;Add +,&quot; and just have &quot;Settings&quot; as you now have to change sounds under both for it to take (if you change it).
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|loved the first game and this one is even better.  only wish you could earn more glue credits like in the first game.
B004LZFWJO|5.0|I love this game. A warning. Very addicting. Everytime I get any free time I'm playing this game. Love it
0399226907|5.0|This is by far the best book we've bought for my daughter. She loves it. The condition of the book is very good too!
B007UW9WOQ|4.0|It was very interesting. I think I'm going to make my own version of sushi and sashimi. I'm inspired to be creative.
0394800184|5.0|My 2 year old loves the book. The condition was also good! Totally recommend it if you have a little toddler!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Immersive, suspenseful, heart-breaking, funny, brilliant. Even though there are thousands of reviews here on Amazon alone, try your best to go in cold on this astounding story. A remarkable book by a self-published author at a great price. Stop reading reviews and start reading this book.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I purchased this mouse less then a month ago and its quality never ceases to amaze. Its easy to set up and customize, it looks great, and most importantly it works. Iv had a gaming mouse in the past that costs triple what the anker gaming mouse costs and i honestly cant find a differance in quality. I whole heartetly reccomend this gaming mouse for anyone in the market for one especially for the price. Im currently using this to play W.O.W. and its amazing
B001LA3LYU|5.0|Master of the axe. If you've ever had any inclination to play the guitar, this video would inspire anyone to run out and purchase one immediately.
B00B69UQEO|2.0|This album is crap. I will not take advantage of the pre-sale to see a band that's so built on hype and marketing bulls*** at this point of their career. What happened to their talent? Why haven't they built on it and created a credible new album? The marketing was 1st class with the slammering of online ads that appeared virtually everywhere I visited on the internet, and the promise of an advanced sale opportunity for the local live show was enticing, but the supreme lameness of the new cd forces me to abandon the idea of putting out for a concert with such a high ticket cost. PISS OFF Depeche Mode!
B00BEZTMFY|3.0|As many have said, telling the Bilbo Baggins story to kill the dragon Smaug could have been one movie.  Instead, we are left with vignettes down dead alleyways that do not truly progress the story.  The beginning could have been dramatically shortened with Bilbo starting his book (Frodo in passing was okay), but there are so many back stories going it was hard to keep track of the real story.  Great visual presentations, althought he Goblin king was poorly done and reminded one of a cartoon character or theft of Jabba The Hut.  And now, two more movies are coming down the pike.  Yawn.  It's just one lousy dragon they're going after.
B000024IK0|4.0|I liked &#34;the door&#34; better but some good guitar playing and good original songs.  I am always disapointed when musicians do songs others have allready done.  They always seem to murder them
B001AQO3QA|5.0|If you're an &#34;Alien&#34; fan you will love this product, it's just that simple. The hours of extras alone will make it worth it.
B000068C3U|4.0|Was a good movie and interesting to watch after seeing a play on Caberet.  Always interesting to see what the actors are up to now.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Safe Haven is  a fast read and very enjoyable. I would definitely recommend it to my friends and to you.
B006LSZECO|4.0|Flynn does a good job of keeping your attention from the very beginning.Her writing style is easy to follow...even though the story is told by two different perspectives. I have to admit that I had a difficult time putting the book down. Even so, I felt the ending was not up to par with the rest of the book.
B001B6PBBK|3.0|If you've seen fewer than fifteen movies in your entire life, maybe something in here will be fresh for you. The movie itself is as tired and rotten as the ironic-bad-artwork in the cliche' \\"artists are nuts\\" scene. Especially heinous is the soundtrack which tries to single-handedly make the fake, fantasy, cheezy characters and lifestyles portrayed appear wacky, yet exciting! Oh! And Classic! Ditto what everyone else said about Britany Murphy. I'm a fan but she must have really been in a bad state making this. Her worst work ever.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Dragged on a bit and I'd rank it 3rd in the series but it wrapped up well is a must read to finish the trilogy
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Great entertainment.  Takes you to a wonderfully large estate in England that many of us would never have a chance to even get near, enjoy a different culture, different lifestyle and a different time.
B005HJ6MRO|5.0|Great product.  Can use easily from another laptop, iPad, iPhone, Windows phone.  Makes setting up a personal storage cloud a breeze.
B0091REZMW|3.0|some of it is challenging - but there is little info to help you with the game.  it seems they would prefer you buy points and diamonds rather than earn them.  not in favor of that.  just want to enjoy the challenge - not have to keep feeding the pot to continue playing.
B009S33I68|4.0|Very good description of the first major combat operations of the Vietnam war. Obviously much more descriptive than the movie and discusses a lot of of the even worse battles that happened after what was described in the movie. The last part of the book (which actually was in the movie as well) is very sad, discussing what the families of the lost went through and where they are at.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This book is full of twists and turns....I loved part 1  in this book...part 2  was just as good if only it ended a little sooner....I did not like the ending...Truely a love story gone wrong...horribly wrong...the characters were easy to love or hate....I still don't know who my favorite character was...
B00BLGXL3U|3.0|CLASSY MOVIE THAT DOESN'T GO ANYWHERE. GREAT ACTING BUT THAT DOESN'T CHANGE<br /><br /> THE FACT THAT YOUR LEFT IN THE SAME PLACE YOU WERE IN AT THE START.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I have a new kindle fire and this is my 1st download and it has taken me 2 days to get it open.  I'M  still in the learning mode and have not had the time to learn. My grand kids are coming next week to help me.
0553801473|4.0|I like this book. No need to talk about the story, it is great. The book binding is very good, hope this one will not break like the massmarket version.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|can't put this game down hooked all the time everyone plays this game a must download this for people that wanna kill time and still have fun and link it to facebook and beat your friends
B006CHML4I|4.0|Nice but to small for me. I have large wrists and I am custom to a larger dial and band. Other than that it seems to be a very nice watch.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The view points of the Germans living with the fear of the war around them and the desperation of so many to earn a living any way possible.  Another view point so well defined in the personalities was very thought provoking.<br /><br />Readers interested in history would not be disappointed in this book.
B009PMEEY2|4.0|This is a connect-the-symbols-to-make-them-disappear game (like Bejewled).  It's got a story behind the levels - but you don't have to read the story to play.  Problem is - it's hard to navigate around the game.  Sometimes it just skips- throws you back to a previous level.  If you don't score well, you don't have the option to play that level again to get a better score. Once I went through the game I had an even harder time opening it and finding the menu with the level options.<br /><br />It's a lot of addictive fun but you have to have patience to negotiate the game.
B00BF11STU|2.0|There was so much hype around this film I expected it to be much better than it was. Besides the fact that this film doesn't really tell you anything you haven't already heard from the mainstream media nor does it go so far as to explore anything as they did in \\"Body of Lies\\" it actually makes Americans look like a bunch of ruthless myopic wankers. Here's the  basic run down: Hard nosed ambitious CIA chick is obsessed with finding Bin Laden, its her job and she's passionate about it yada yada yada. They torture a few people at Gitmo or some US black site to get the intel yada  yada yada and then she has a hunch follows the hunch and she finds & kills OBL, she's then seen crying on the plane leaving Afghanistan screen goes to black. Why? It doesn't matter why because we really don't care that much about her anyway. And no there isn't really anything much more in between. This lacked the character development seen in say \\"Black Hawk Down\\" and it doesn't deeply explore anything as did \\"Body of Lies\\" and frankly I found the leading character (or maybe its the actress) to be a bore.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Great movie. I recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the LotR movies. The colors are beautiful and Martin Freeman is amazing as Bilbo Baggins. I've probably watched it 8 times already.
1419705849|5.0|My son love this book and the movies. I bought this book to add to his collection. Now he have all seven books.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|I  was COMPLETELY sucked into this book,  read it in a  few hours!  cannot wait until the next one comes out!!
B00AMBLDEE|4.0|needed my action , good guy, bad guy, hero, that continue's the Borne legacy, well done and doesn't disappoint and even the wife loved it - win win
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|There is so much to do and explore with your shark!  It is fun dressing your shark up and having them eat people on the beach, that sounded kinda weird. Anyway, it is fun to discover under water caves and stuff like dat!  But,  I too am someone who reads the reviews before downloading an app,  it works good on kindle fire!  Plus it is free, so download this app Cuz it is loads of fun and you will love it like I do! And they give you dailey rewards In a pirates chest. And your shark has to eat enough or they will die, so ya Download dis app!  its funzee!
B00B5HQKNI|4.0|doesn't disappoint, even my wife enjoyed it, not as cool as past since they use some fake graphics and images, but that's todays film...still Good
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I loved the story and I found it to be very well written.  My book club enjoyed the discussion on many levels.
1400069742|5.0|Lynne Olson delivers a wonderful book on the history of how America entered World War II.  This book offers a broad survey that covers a wide range of factors from Lindberg, to the British to Wendell Willkie on what allowed FDR to declare war on Nazi Germany and come to the aid of the British.  The book looks through the lens of American popular opinion as the interventionists and isolationists battled back and forth.  With Lindbergh and conservative republicans leading the isolationist charge to the Century Group that was working to sway public opinion towards war and intervention all sides are given a fair look.  Olson is fairly critical of FDR accusing him of not being able to lead the American public and of waiting for public opinion to change before initiating a course of action.  Although my first book by Olson on this subject (of her many that she has on similarly topics) I found her writing to be engaging and hitting on the key points with solid arguments.  She marshals a wide array of sources and looks at how the public opinion was being shaped by the major players at the time.  For those looking for an in-depth account of Lindbergh in this book you will probably find it fall short as it focuses on a much broader array of issues related to America's entry into the war beyond just the Lindbergh and Roosevelt intellectual fight.  Still it is a well written book that does a great job of looking at America's long and tumultuous road to World War II.
B001ILFUDM|5.0|All 4 of my grandchildren loved it.  Their ages are 5 1/2, 5, 3, and too.  Great buy for kids all all ages.
B006LSZECO|1.0|In the beginning, this book grabbed my attention as I read the husband's account.  However, it quickly became a nightmare that I felt I had to endure in order to find an ending with some sort of redemption.  There was not one character in this story that I connected with nor even remotely liked.  I did not enjoy the read at all, so it was a painful journey to get to the end.  And then, surprise!  The story ended when, it appeared, the author simply ran out of ideas or steam and became weary of her own tale.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is spool addictive!!!!! I play this game practically all day, no matter what!! If you like Temple Run, you need to get this app!!!
B008Y6WF8W|5.0|Gritty, sometimes funny, gory thriller with an all-star cast. Wasn't sure if this would be good but I definitely wasn't disappointed!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I've used this for the past two years on my phone and find it even more beneficial on a tablet.
B0031RS2HC|5.0|i absolutely loved it.The story line was good.This is the second jack reacher book so far can't wait to read another one
B00821OX98|4.0|It Spielberg on the small screen. Done well, heis versatile enough to make it work very well. Noah Wylie is a good but underrated actor. His lead is strong. Good supoorting cast as well lead by Moon Bloodgood. Straight drama and action with levity. Some cheers and some tears but do look for the occasional one liner thrown in.
B0037Z8SLI|5.0|Atul Gawande writes well and makes a clear argument for using check lists. As a practising surgeon, I've seen checklists introduced by dictat in the<br />UK, modified by people who clearly haven't read this book, and become dangerous. In my current practice we use them, but reading this extended essay enthuses me to use them more effectively. This book should be required reading for surgeons in training.
B0000DZ3EA|4.0|Great music and collection-only cd I have found that has both Sledgehammer and in Your Eyes on it. CD in very good condition as well.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|Every song on the album is a winner.  This is far from a one-hit wonder.  It's infectious and will stick with you for days, if not weeks, on end.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love this game, reminds me of my old horse could sit for hours and play this game. T11942479c in c.f. hvyvyvhv
B0064MGU98|5.0|I've heard great things about this show for a few years. Watched the pilot episode on Sunday night. 14 episodes later (it's only Friday) I'm addicted to this show!!  All the characters are Multi-faceted, not like usual shows where there's the villain, the good girl, the best friend, the dutiful side kick, etc.  It's just good writing & acting.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game but I can't stand losing and I love the tunnels.I play this a lot and I'm better than my mummy, daddy and grandad at it. By Jack, aged 6
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game subway surfers is amazing. It is hard fun and interesting. Subway surfers changes their theme every 27 days. My brother and I always play it.  We always compete. But I always win Almost.  Have a great time playing!!!  <3.  =-D
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Why use any of the rest when google is the best?i will only use the best available to me period
B00B5JBZGS|4.0|I have listened to it three times now and I seem to like it more each time.  I love the guitar solos they have incorporated into the songs this time around.  The instrumentals sound incredibly clean along with the vocals.  I'm glad that if they had to replace Howard it was with the original singer.  I loved the original self titled all they way through As Daylight Dies (not a fan of the second self titled).  And this one is right up there.  My only gripe was that it seemed like the vocals at times softened what started as a heavy track.  Hard to explain, but I just wish they included a couple pure relentless, gritty tracks like Temple from the Within or To the Sons of Man.  Maybe just wishful thinking.  Great album though.  Easy 4/5.
B004H6G0TI|5.0|I thought I would just give this one a try and it became the game I wanted to play all the time. Great variety and as the difficulty rises it is just challenging enough to keep me interested without feeling impossible
B0040HO01Y|5.0|It is so easy to get hooked into the Lark Rise/Candleford families, their woes and joys, their learning and growing up.  Makes me want to move to Candleford!
0393088774|5.0|Until I read this book, I knew Krugman only as a talking head on Sunday Morning talk shows. I thought of him as just another fuzzy thinking liberal. I was born during the depression and remember WWII well; my father and two uncles were in it. His arguments for a massive stimulus, short of war, make sense in that context. But, in view of all of our free trade agreements, how do we keep the spending in the US where it is needed.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Awesome show. (Spoiler Alert!) i personally think that Merle should have lived onto the 4rth season and that the governor shouldn't have slaughtered all his men. It's fine with me that the governor lived, though. Although, a more interesting ending to the 3rd season could have been something live: the governor doesn't kill all his men and he returns for a second go at the prison, and then someone who really hates him ends up killing him(for example, Michonne, Merle if he was still alive, or Daryl if he knew that he had killed Merle) You may have noticed that I have a lot of negative things in this comment. I'm not a hater, though and it's still the best show ever.
B002VPE1WK|4.0|Good for the average SRL camera.  enough room for a camcorder also.  Appears to be well built......... ...... .... ...
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I really enjoyed the Martian. I liked the format and the fast pace and was impressed with the detail given to problem solving on the characters journey.

B00785P2QC|3.0|fun game, but a little too tutorial like for my taste. wish it was like sim city<br />more, but still funmore
B00A9V2JSG|5.0|great dystopian series, one of the first that i have ever read. would recomend this to my friends and family.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this book, the storyline is amazing and the author proves that August Pullman truly is a wonder. August is a kid with not exactly a normal face, but the kids that he meets prove to overlook that.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I liked this game. I've played a lot and this one was pretty good. Only thing is......<br />!!!!*spoiler alert*!!!!<br /><br />Wish it had a better ending. Like what happened to jim
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I am particular about the books I read.  The story can be ridiculous, but if the writing is good, I'll enjoy it.  The imagery was vivid, the characters were well-developed and the dystopia was well thought out.  I didn't really expect to enjoy it and resisted reading it for a long time.  I devoured all three books in under two weeks.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is a fun and easy way to spend your time! I find myself playing for long periods of time!  It's the better version of Temple Run, hands down.
0345529057|3.0|The books are somewhat small and when they arrived to my apartment their sides were damaged.<br />Other than that this is a great addition to your library.
B0031RSATC|4.0|Sarcastically exposes much that is wrong with the world of medicine. Takes the traditional heroic image of doctors and turns it upside down.

B004V9J3HM|5.0|Buying everything this guy had his hands on!!! Buy it now and see for yourself!!! Great guitar work - excellent!!!
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I wanted to read the book before seeing the movie. It took me far away from reality into pat people's world. Can't wait to see the movie.
B00BJS7LHC|3.0|Great acting by all four main characters, but what was with so much blood flying all over the place.  Tarintino must have been trying out some new technique to simulate real gun shots.  Hard to watch.  Liked the movie, but would not watch it again because of the graphic violence.  It was good to see the slaves come out on top, and overcome and rise above their oppression.  Too bad there wasn't more of that in real life, or was there?  Did not stream as HD to my t.v. as advertised.
B008220DGE|4.0|The Master is a compelling movie, even if it took me several watches to try and figure out what I was supposed to be taking away from it.  And even now, I do not think I know.<br /><br />Joaquin Phoenix and Philip Seymour Hoffman make this movie worth watching.  They are intense and real, yes crude and despicable, but oh so real and flawed!  Amy Adams is just as damaged and stoic, yet so interesting.  I loved watching them interact.<br /><br />The plot was slow are points and jarringly disjointed.  These men journey through a discovery of the world, of life, of each other and themselves, but in the end I think Hoffman's character misses the point due to greed and ambition. Phoenix is enlightened, but still lost and hurt.  Maybe that is why so many people found this movie so disagreeable.<br /><br />It is by no means a perfect movie.  Like all PTA films, it is a compelling tale of strong acting and unlikely characters.  Watch it for the acting if nothing else.
B00632HWOG|2.0|I don't like having to click every email to delete it. I miss your old page that had a &#34;check all&#34; button. If I could go back I would!
B005K17RU0|4.0|seems accurate, easy to use. I like the layout and my daughter enjoys the preset locations. I don't use it every day
B007Q0OUKS|5.0|My 8 y/o grandson loves this!  He has thanked me by phone twice now.  Can't wait to visit to see his assembly.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|Best game I've ever played<br />I'm 30 hours in and still completely enthralled by the story.<br />The graphics aren't amazing or spectacular; however, the story is second only to metal gear (IMO), and the uniqueness and openness of the game is one in a million. I feel this game is definitely worth the price. I rate games on whether or not it is worth purchasing; being that you can easily get 40 hours of playing time out of this (meaning roughly $0.75 cents an hour) it's a great value
B003KK6GOQ|5.0|A truly delightful book with an unusual way of depicting the historic events that took place in Guernsey during and after WWII and of how its residents coped with the Nazi occupation and made the best of things. The title might be off-putting to some - but don't let it put you off. I admit that in the early stages of the book I found the epistolary method  a bit strange but it didn't take long and I was hooked. After a chance encounter by letter with a resident of Guernsey, Juliet in London is soon corresponding regularly with a circle of people in the Island's literary society. The author uses the epistolary method expertly to bring out the varying characters of her correspondents and the events in Guernsey during the war. I began the book with doubts that I would enjoy it but quickly discovered what a truly delightful book it really was. I thoroughly recommend it.
B000FC1AGG|3.0|I used to love her books, but they all follow the same pattern.  Spoiler alert:  this one is no different.
B00C1BU7V8|4.0|DDL played a great Lincoln! Definitely a must see. Gonna watch it again to see what historical references I may have missed.
6305428352|5.0|Prompt delivery and great packaging<br />I have watched this movie over and over and it never fails to  make me laugh and cry.  A heart warming story.
B005ZCXPP0|4.0|This is a solid action movie on par with iron man in my opinion. Definitely worth a watch. Word up!
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|Very intriguing game. This game was on the easy side and only had trouble trying to pick things up. would reccomend any of the big fish games like these very entertaining.
B008TRUDAS|4.0|This book is young adult and I loved it. Any book that makes me experience so many emotions has my vote.
0783235380|5.0|I watched the whole disc there and there were no problems with the disc as of yet.  The product is in good condition and as described.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|If you are searching for an inexpensive but very useful faux Christmas tree storage cover...this is the one for you.  It stores my two thin trees (6' and 7') with extra room!  And the plastic is thick enough that you don't have to worry that the trees will puncture the cover.  Perfect affordable product.
B0002F6BRE|5.0|I was able to watch through the entire movie (and laugh and laugh and laugh) without any problems with the disc.  I love this movie and I always find new parts that make me laugh.  I would recommend it unless you are person who doesn't like Will Ferrell which I personally cannot relate. :)
B00A8ECU24|2.0|Amazon hasn't put in updAtes!! My kids game on iPod has had 3 updAtes since I started playing and Amazon hasn't approved the updAtes yet so we get non. Missing  lots of limited items and ponies because of it. Better to play using Apple or Android! Would chance but have to much time in my town now
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I love this game, I've been playing it for about a year now and I love it! I own 3 horses, one of which I won:)
B00BW5K5DO|5.0|I really like this game. I would recommend the purchase of this game. It has several levels that are challenging.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|this is one show that has been a favorite since the beginning will continue to buy as it becomes available..fun watching the characters grow up as the relationships change
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Every body been talking about this game so I hare to get it. When I got it I was in Rome I got all of the specials for Rome to.
B005WUHAX8|3.0|This case has held up well against my clumsiness. Pros: is definitely water resistant, keeps phone from breaking when dropped on concrete (multiple times). Cons: hard to change the side button that controls whether the volume is on or not, cannot use headphones without the adapter (this keeps the case water resistant, hard to  maneuver your charger around the case, hard to get the case on, the sides aren't flush with the screen so texting is more difficult. Overall I would recommend this product.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|A very fun game with daily challenges and mission to keep it interesting. He periodic chages in location also make the game good for long term enjoyment.
B0094BB4TW|1.0|This new update is having a lot of problems it won't let me see my friends who are are online
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Great show. Not just about zombies, but the human condition in extreme circumstances.  Great actors. So happy amazon lets me buy the episodes to keep, I will watch this over and over!
B004SUWR2C|5.0|I love this game it is just like uno but as a game on your own electronic. I love this game!!!
B00BTLSURE|5.0|This album is great. the music is Fresh and New yet it still has their distinct sound. I definitely recommend this album.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is really fun but sometimes it is a little boring and you deal as if you wish this company made more of these kind of games.
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|I cannot say enough about this book.  Phenomenal story that's actually true.  Very surprised Hollywood hasn't jumped on this one.  Just hope they don't try to mess it up by putting more drama than it already has.
B004XVN1T4|5.0|I can't say enough how much I like his books. Historical fiction at its best...compelling stories, great characters. I'll read them all!
0767834739|5.0|I bought this as part of completing the series. I hadn't seen it since it first came out & watching it I saw many things I had apparently missed the first time I watched. I've watched it a few times since I got this DVD and love it. It has lots of action, keeps you engaged throughout the whole movie.
B00028HBKC|5.0|Mel Gibson, in spite of his checkered past, made a wonderful contribution to Christians everywhere with this product.  The pain and torture suffered by Jesus is too often diminished with easy words like scourge and hit.  They don't begin to describe the horrible treatment that Jesus received on the Friday that he died.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Keanu was great in this movie. While it has religious overtones it also has alot of action scenes. I've watched it about 12 times so far.
B009FZHYKU|2.0|this is a totally different show now, personally liked the 1 and 2 season better. will wait for it to come on netflix before buying anymore episodes
B003Y5H5EW|5.0|If you like any of the Underworld Movies you'll like this one. I bought it because I had seen it on TV and loved it. Now I have the series.
B007SGLZP8|3.0|I have read most of Grisham's books and until this one, have always been thrilled.  this one is almost 100% writtin in the first person and really boring.  like I said, I am struggling to get thru.  so If you want to read a story that is all in the first person you will like this.  if you're looking for some narrative and story telling - get another
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Great reading in light of what is going on in our world today. It is a little concerning to think that this can really happen.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's an awsome game but make it like temple run 2 add something so when u<br />Die u can be brought to life that will make it better -jessie ,stay awsome
B001O1O71C|5.0|I love it ,it's been a thrilling friendship of Bruno and Shmuel and ended as a confusing and sad one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 4yr old loves this. We \\"take care\\" of her horse at least twice a day.Great for teaching how much work it takes to keep a horse.
B008CJ0KBU|5.0|who wouldn't what to be fae and be part of that lovely family make you feel at home and safe and sound
B004MKLRYC|4.0|This was an amusing read but not as sharp or witty as I was hoping it would be. Ultimately however it is much more subversive than expected and this is what elevated it from 3 to 4 stars for me.<br /><br />On discovering a latent love of literature, the queen also discovers that despite being considered one of the most powerful women in the world she has no voice of her own. She is merely a figurehead who is trotted out to open hospitals, chat with the common folk and give occasional speeches, but it soon dawns on her that no one really listens to what she says. She becomes increasingly interested in discussing authors and ideas, but the only person she has to share her thoughts with is Norman, a young man who she meets on her visit to a mobile library parked in the palace grounds. Most people around her are hostile to her new-found passion for the written word and they do not want to see the queen expressing an opinion or stepping beyond the boundaries set for her by history and tradition. She begins to rebel against these restrictions, first in very subtle ways and then more openly.<br /><br />One of the great strengths of the book is its potrayal of the cultural backwardness of the political leaders of today which I feel is very realistic. The ignorant prime minster whose eyes glaze over whenever the queen tries to discuss literature with him is a thinly veiled portrayal of Tony Blair. I loved the ending when she announces to her Privy Council that she is going to write a book of her own and quickly disabuses them of the hope that it will be something uncontroversial. \\"I was thinking of something more radical. More.....challenging.\\"<br /><br />She later tells the gathered minsters: \\"One has met and indeed entertained many visiting heads of state, some of them unspeakable crooks and blackguards....One has given one's white-gloved hand to hands that were steeped in blood and conversed politely with men who have personally slaughtered children. One has waded through excrement and gore....Sometimes one has felt like a scented candle, sent in to perfume a regime, or aerate a policy, monarchy these days just a government-issue deoderant.\\"<br /><br />Yes indeed! One can only hope the real queen has an opportunity to peruse this quirky little book with a deep message at its heart.excrement and gore....Sometimes one has felt like a scented candle, sent in to perfume a regime, or aerate a policy, monarchy these days just a government-issue deoderant.\\"<br /><br />Yes indeed! One can only hope the real queen has an opportunity to peruse this quirky little book with a deep message at its heart.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I had read the Notebook prior to this and I loved it.  I felt that Safe Haven was as good as the Notebook because the style was the same and the ending was an interesting switch.  It was romantic and lite and  welcome change from the heavier books that I have been reading lately.  I could relax and enjoy.  I would recommend this book anyone, especially women.
B005S9EKCW|5.0|As my headline states. I will be watching this frequently. Outstanding movie. Outstanding actors. The music was tremendous. It's another work recognizing what people go through when dealing with Monarchy in various countries.
B00BI745AA|3.0|I was disappointed with this production that has been highly hyped in the press. Two aspects that I did not like.<br />1. The main actors/actresses were primarily actor not singers. I was interested in see Les Mis as a musical production.<br />2. I did not like the opera format where all dialogue was sung, not spoken.<br /><br />But that's just me. Other may love it.
030758836X|3.0|This mystery shows just how awful people can get. The author absolutely did his job. I didn't care for the villian in this story but I believe this could and probably does happen in some cases.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I like this program because it offers daily reading and yearly plans.  I rate it a number 5 out of 5.
B008FYZIVY|3.0|It went too long. I kind of lost the interest to finish it. It is not as good as other period dramas I watched before.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|This book kept me reading it because I wanted to know what happened to the boy.  Too much detail was given in the beginning and not enough in the end.  We really wanted to know the good things that happened to him along the way.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|I'm writing this review right after I watched this movie (and ordered part 2). All I can say is this DVD is totally worth the price.  But as other reviewers have said this is not for the young children due to the violence.<br />  I got so into the plot almost as much as I did  animated Spawn. And it even has me pulling out my old &#34;Batman The Animated&#34; series dvds until my next order arrives.  Well written, well voiced.  I'm a happy fan indeed.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I think this is the best role playing game for kindle hands down. Every thing you could want and portable. I recommend trying it to anyone who likes role play games.
B002BI6SMI|5.0|If you are thinking about the risks of travel consider this as a primer.  Unsupervised youths are at risk beyond their knowledge and wisdom. A single adult in the mix would have made a difference in the risk.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway Surfers is AWESOME! I love how the theme changes each month<br /> And i like how there's limited time characters and boards!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Page-turning easy reading. The characters are well developed so that the reader feels as if they are real people, flawed and complex but realistic.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|this game is awesome its realistic and enjoyable and there's so many things to do and everything has its own unique strategy its so worth the money
B0099PCUIC|5.0|For the price, they can't be beat. They are extremely comfortable, They direct the sound right to your ear drum.
B00BGZ8TVA|5.0|WoooooWhooooo, Ang Lee...I like most the longing you put into your movies...give me another such experience...give us that experience of coming to long for another that makes life/living so vivid and real.....Thank you
B001FVV2X2|5.0|Great show.  I'm so glad I found it on Amazon.  This is the best sight for streaming so many shows.
B003UMW69I|5.0|I've read the reviews bashing this film as a set piece full of cliches.  Sorry, but I find this to be a very funny film due to the acting talents of Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds who work perfectly together.
B0050PYNOY|5.0|I believe enjoying this movie requires a knowledge and appreciation of fantasy movies, as it is a loving farce.<br /><br />Hilarious from start to finish with thousands of low-brow laughs.
B0036BK6MW|4.0|Sandra Bullock did a great job, but the screenplay itself is too sparse.  I've got a feeling that the subject matter influenced many to rate this movie higher than it deserves.
B00AN0KBJC|5.0|Wish I had HBO, but I'm looking forward to getting Season 3. I thought Season 2 kinda dragged there a bit in the middle episodes, but it ended strongly and still has me on the hook.
B00BHU9DUK|1.0|Great epic love story that was destroyed by a concept to bring in theater on the screen.  There is to much moving in the screen for someone to pay attention to the story.  Also, it may be hard to understand the story if you have not read the book.  Flop!
B00AY5B9QA|4.0|The ending is a bit cheesy, alas! but I thoroughly enjoyed the film.<br /><br />Why do I need to type x# of words?
B00B8WXFWE|3.0|I personally thought NKOTB's comeback album, \\"The Block,\\" was much more true to their typical \\"boy band\\" style, while still being fresh and modern.  This album seems very heavy on the dance beats, and not in a good way.  Almost every song on the album has a similar dance beat in the background.  I did really love the song \\"Remix\\" as it seems very fresh and modern, without being overly \\"Euro pop.\\"  In general, I thought the instrumentals were a bit overdone.  Some of NKOTB's biggest hits (I'll be loving you) were nothing but a keyboard and light percussion through most of the song.  Its a bit disappointing that they have gotten away from this, even if it has been 25 years.  I do think the production quality on this album was very good and the vocals seem to be more \\"belty\\" than on that last album.  It did have a bit of an \\"auto tune\\" feel though at times, once again, disappointing.<br /><br />My guess is that there are a ton of positive reviews on this album because the die hard fans that were anxiously awaiting a new album would have given a pile of crap a glowing review.  This is not a pile of crap, lol, but it is entirely different than the last album, so if you loved the sound of the last album, you may not like this one, or if you weren't sure about the last album, you may like this one.
B002361MLA|5.0|every one on this planet should read this book. It take practice, but it works. it is a difficult book to read. i had to read it couple of times to get the point.
B003ZMF26W|4.0|This is a great gaming mouse.  However, this isn't a 'plug and play' mouse.  It does require some setup.  I made the mistake of assuming I could use it immediately after plugging it into my computer (like most mice).  Wrong. There is an installation CD hidden inside the box, mine was behind a cardboard flap.  Also, make sure and read the directions.  My mouse will randomly go out of sync since I haven't set it up properly.  I simply unplug it, and plug it back in and everything is fine.<br /><br />Pros:<br />It has convenient extra buttons all over the mouse for gaming<br />Laser sensor is super smooth<br />Easy interface to change mouse settings<br />Up to 4000 DPI<br /><br />Cons:<br />Initial setup is very difficult for users new to using a gaming mouse<br />Requires reading the instructions prior to use<br />Options are a tad overwhelming<br />The DPI button on the mouse can be bumped occasionally and change your settings<br /><br />Once you figure everything out it is a great mouse!
B0076HNMU0|5.0|Although there is a lot of violence and murder, the show is so confusing and full of twists it is a great watch. The varieties of personalities and interactions going on alone with the mystical, magical aspects make this very intriguing. I loved it, and think it is one of the best shows ever.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|I'm a frequent reader, and a huge critic. John green is my favorite author, and everything he writes is perfection to me.<br /><br />This book is no exception.<br /><br />It will make you laugh, it will make you cry. & it brings something new to the table every time you read it. I should know, considering I've read it seven times.<br /><br />You would be wasting your time reading a book other than this- unless it is another of John greens. Then, you're in the clear.<br /><br />Read it. You won't regret it.
B001Q9J4PG|5.0|Excellent writing as well as fast moving plot.  The characters were believable like someone who lives next door.  The only question regarding the plot was one piece of technology at the end.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|I love this movie! The acting was excellent and the cast was well chosen. I love the plot and the I my thing I would add is a shot with Wolverine when they stoned the beach together in the comic.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|Gooo oo oo oo oo oo ooo oo ooo oo oo ooo ooo oo ooo od game goo oo ood
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Fun game to play whenever you have any spare time, I got it as one of first games and haven't stopped playing it. Overall a very entertaining game which I recommend greatly.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|Ken Follett really gets you involved in all the characters and makes you LIKE reading about history. Would recommend any of his books for a good read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Better then the first two!! Great story! You want to know what happens next! A real page turner, with lots of surprises
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|I feel this story was written more for a &#34;young&#34; adult (under 25) vs. a mature one (over 50), but it flowed well.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is a movie that must be watched over and over for little bits of information. How cool would it be to have been able to participate in the production of a movie that brought together three very unique and hugely talented musicians.<br /><br />Absolutely loved watching it as I grew up in the 70's with Led Zeppelin and later U2 music. There are segments of the movie which the artists explain their playing techniques or settings for some of their equipment.<br /><br />Highly recommend this movie and you'll be loving every moment of it, provided you like listening to rock-n-roll.
1250006341|5.0|I am totally addicted to Downton Abbey.  I am fascinated with the time period and wish today's society had the same respect and manners so desperately needed with human intervention. This makes the TV program more fun, but I love the history revealed in this book.  I'm not expecting society to adopt a separate class. Just have respect for people and our individual gifts: everyone matters.
B0035XVVDY|5.0|An excellent movie with Jamie Fox and Gerard Butler.  Both give excellent performances of intelligent men and a great dark portrayal by Mr. Butler.  A great who did that, then HOW did he do it.

B000002H6C|5.0|I don't know why they need so many review words for an album. It's just great, amazing and you love it. that's all.
B00A6PD9I4|5.0|If, like me, you are always on the prowl for movies w/out a flimsy tittering princess, then this the movie for you. Great voices, as always, (spoiler alert!) who doesn't love a movie where the girl puts a curse on her mom? And, yes, a happy ending for all. Typical 2-3 dark 'n scary scenes, but the triplets make up for it.
B000000OQF|5.0|I don't know why they need so many review words for an album. It's just great, amazing and you love it. that's all.

B004J4WKTW|1.0|This box seemed very interesting for a casual read and was ordered by my 19 year old.  who promptly called me to inform me that the language is unbearable and wanted to order a different book.
B00594XOZU|4.0|It works great on my KINDLE FIRE HD, but it didn't works great on my ANDROID cellphone device. I don't know why?
B0074JODP8|5.0|He is starting to emerge on the scene as a premier guitar player. His best work yet! Must have for guitar players.
B007RI56NY|4.0|I bought it because of a good deal and having only known and liked 50 ways to say goodbye. I am liking the other songs too now.
B001R0CY9M|4.0|Lifetime fan of UFO & Paul Chapman era sometimes is criminally over looked, Why?<br /><br />No reason to go into great detail just buy this remaster you will not be disapointed.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I made the mistake of buying cuz my (female) friend was raving about it. I don't get it. I think you need a uterus to understand how this book is anything but juvenile and boring.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|Just like the others, this was a good read.  Lee Child always comes through.  Great description and entertaining story line.
B00BI73CVI|1.0|This movie is full of filth! Me and my husband had been wanted to see this since it came out in the theater and it was horrible! There is so much trash talk and very inappropriate scenes. If you have any values at all stay away from this movie.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This os a great game I sit around and nolife this game whether I'm at school home or with friends
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Grandchildren loves it even put it on my iPad for them so there is no fighting or no crying anymor
B008Y73940|5.0|Excellent acting and very good plot. Well worth watching. This movie reminded me of a John Grisham story but acting was better then most Grisham movies.
B009RH9HDS|5.0|I love this case! It's perfect for reading at all angles and the color is exactly like it looks online!
B003TTCURU|5.0|I like the characters and how they keep evolving.  This is the only show I make sure I am home to watch all week
B004DLPXAO|4.0|All good.  I'd like to see a bookshelf or folder system on Kindle fro Android and the Amazon web site to allow you to organise books by category.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I love this show! Its hilarious, dramatic and singing!!! I love it its amazing watch it! Awesome, I promise yupp!
B006LSZECO|3.0|This had a lot of twists and turns but it was a little long. I didn't live how it ended but I couldn't not finish it.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This is an awesome, addictive game.  These train &quot;puzzles&quot; are vrry challenging and loads of fun.  You will love it!
B00BBW16HW|5.0|Really enjoyed this film. Witty, heart warming (not in a cheesy way!). Just really good. Recommend, recommend, recommend!  Even my husband liked it - touching without being drippy
B0064QNS62|1.0|I thought this stunk.  The controls put your thumbs right in the way.  The graphics aren't good, the sound is irritating, and the gameplay is only hood enough to put me in the mood to play a better game.  Like Paplinko.  Also, it's really hard to clean spaghetti sauce off the ceiling, in case you're wondering.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|All that echoes continues to replay in my mind, reverberating with such purity i am mesmerized. I am new to Josh Groban and now a convert. This eclectic collection showcases his talent as a dynamic songwriter alongwith his powerful voice.  For the uninitiated listener \\"All That Echoes\\"' is a wonderful introduction to the many talented Groban.  If i was an addict, he would be my fix.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|awesome this app is really super trooper dooper awesome gh bh hv vggg f g c x d c f g g g
B0074VA2T2|4.0|This is a great starter program for pre-school and kinder kids. It goes right along with the book. My Grandkids love it
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|Decent game but like others better. Works fine on my Kindle Fire HD. Just not as much fun as Jewels.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|I couldn't get this book out of my head,  i am not sure if I love it or hate it!<br />It is disturbing, but i had to keep reminding myself it was fiction. So in saying that it demonstrates it is a well written book
B0098460O4|5.0|My husband and I saw a video of them on Youtube when they were trying out on some tv show. We instantly went to Amazon to order the cd. Very talented pair.
B005H0CBZ0|3.0|I zipped through book 1 and 2, couldn't wait to get this one but struggled through it. Maybe I am getting bored with them? I do want to finish the series though.
0805092447|5.0|I bought this for my 2 year old boy and he loves it. All three of my kids get into this book when we read it. It's a staple in our daily reading.
B0084AXZK0|4.0|Oscar Wilde , a very good author, but at times has a rambling present. It is a good read tho, and very good for recommendation to be read.
1844256383|4.0|I have pllayed the Tenor Sax on and off for 40 years, but really have never had much technical information about how all the parts work together. This is a great guide. Well written. Some of the sections on tuning and troubleshooting and adjusting the action are a bit too techie for just reading through (you get lost in the details), but would be invaluable if you were trying to troubleshoot or tune your own action. Overall a great investment.
B0026P3G12|5.0|This was ordered  as a Christmas gift for a very dear friend.  It was just what she wanted and she was pleased.
B005COO1X6|5.0|Very well written suspenseful  and unbelievable. The Emotional people are very  scared  for Good reason  They're  smart to be frightened.
B003HARV3Y|4.0|This was ordered at the request of a grandchild as a Christmas gift.  It was just what they wanted and pleased the parents too.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Such a great story. Hard to put the book down. I've read another books by this author and she is a really good storyteller.
B005G4TJUC|5.0|Ordered this for my grandson for Christmas.  It was just what he wanted.  what more can I say but thanks!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|I love subway surfers, but since the beginning of March, it wouldn't tell me how to update the app. In January and February, the app updated on its own and I would be able to play the new cities but now I can't because of this problem. Uggh!!!
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This replacement cord works perfectly and really saved me.  Was on a trip and left my charger cord 1600 mi away at home.  I was amazed when I received this replacement in only 3 days!  .  What can I say?<br />I am VERY satisfied with product AND service!
B003YGSLDA|5.0|Dudley Moore was great and John lithgow a hoot. Should have been more of Huddleston.That's all ther is to say.
B003UYUQZW|4.0|This was ordered at the request of a grandchild as a Christmas gift.  It was just what they wanted and pleased the parents too.
B000000TDH|5.0|This new record has very great quality! I could not be any happier with my purchase!!  Thank you very much!
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|Who am i to judge this...the book speaks for itself ......<br />Mystery, Fantasy, Fiction,,,everything in balance though Piper and Jason wanna make me puke....
B000003BDI|5.0|This new record has very great quality! I could not be any happier with my purchase!!  Thank you very much!
B0037W5NIC|1.0|Big ZERO on my rating scale.  It was advertized as being written in French. I received the book, but in English.  I re-ordered the book and again received it again in English!  Bye Bye.
B003QTUQGU|4.0|I rented this for my 6 year old grandson and he loved it.  At first I thought it might be too scary but it wasn't.  I was reluctant to rent due to the strange Burton vision of the tale but my grandson really wanted to see it so I gave it a try.  Worked out just fine.  As an adult, I didn't care for it much.  It was an interesting presentation of this story but, as usual, Burton is too quirky for me.
B00BFUC8RC|2.0|l like this game but it Is so  slow sometime when it is not slow it will be a good game
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Tried others but this one seems to do the best at what it does.  I downloaded it but noted that it came already installed on a new tablet.  Haven't used it long, but after what I have used it for, I think this one's a keeper.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Very spooky, intense!  I love this show, but its almost too intense at times, yet there are humorous aspects also.
B0085PFG1U|4.0|Just a neophite math student, but like what this does.  Is a little slow drawing the graph sometimes, but handles things like the graph of tan x better than most.  Haven't tried the derivative functions, and couldn't locate an antiderivative function, but haven't looked at the help web page much so might be more there.  The larger your range (set by thumb and forfinger expansion and contraction) the slower it is.  This is actually a good sign as it means the program is taking the larger area it is drawing into consideration, and trying to figure out all the values therein.  At least I think that is what is happening.  For most typical formulas I inputed there was no problems using this calculator.
B003HARV7A|3.0|Yeah, sure the film is bad, but it has some redeeming moments. Naomi really put a lot of effort into this flick, and she convinced me she had the stuff to be a real showgirl if she wanted (but who would want it?).  In it's entirety the film comes off as a kind of skewered comedy.  But, I did learn a few things about the fiercely competitive efforts among the dancers to be the lead or shuffle for a better position.  The stuff that goes on backstage is unsavory but seemingly realistic.  My favorite scene comes near the end when Naomi kicks the crap out of a famed superstar singer -- for having her best friend gang-raped and sent to the hospital.  As Naomi has no trouble kick boxing the low-life around the room (in her stiletto shoes), you do feel a sense of some satisfaction.  If you are expecting a taut, realistic drama, you won't be interested, but as a pure fantasy, it's not as bad as critics and others describe it.
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I couldn't wait to get this CD open to listen to it.  It did not disappoint.  Cohen's voice has the ability to alter slightly as the song requires. I was lulled by &#34;Lover Lover, Lover&#34;, swept up and pulled to my feet with &#34;Closing Time&#34;. I loved the entire CD and was happy that I had bought TWO so I will be able to introduce my son-in-law to Leonard Cohen for his birthday this month.
B001XUPH9K|3.0|Never was a Star Trek fan, still not.  Tried and didnt like the movie. Didnt realize how special effects have changed over the past 30 years
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Great for kids who want a horse. Good quality pictures and pretty interactive.  Competing is fun to do and there are some cool tack and horses to choose from
B004GUSG4M|5.0|It was really hard to predict where the story was going...I like that.  As an avid reader, it was pleasant to be surprised by each turn of the plot.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I think I have read all of Grisham's books and have enjoyed every one. This one was no exception. Lawyer Malcome Bannister has been wrongfully incarcerated( accused of racketeering). While helping his fellow inmates with their cases he figures out a scheme to get himself out of prison and to do a little pay back. Well written it keeps you guessing there a lot of twists and turns that keep to guessing up to the very end.
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|[[ASIN:B004ZMWUCU The Misremembered Man]]  This book started out a bit slow for me and I wasn't sure I wanted to finish it.  However, once I really got into it, I had to keep reading.  It is well written with a mix of happy, sad, funny, poignant, and tragic. There are some laugh-out-loud moments as well as some horrific scenes of life in the orphanage.  This story will linger in your mind long after finishing the book.
B002BFBAWO|5.0|This film isolates a silce of Americana so beautifully; it's very, very rich, Eisenberg and Stewart (who was also good in &#34;Into the Wild&#34;) had great chemistry, with a great supporting cast, it all fell together and pulled me in.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I am in LOVE!! This is an amazing app, seriously!<br /><br />I'm using it on my Kindle Fire, and have experienced no issues with download/opening/operating the app, whatsoever. Slight negative is there are no directions upon opening the app, but it's pretty basic when it comes to use. If you're able to download the app, you'll easily be able to figure out how to use the app.<br /><br />My only complaint? I can't buy this in a version for tidying my house, and easily eliminating clutter!! ;^)
B002M5E2DW|5.0|I've read this book a dozen times and I keep coming back to it. Each time I learn something new about myself.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the book and had a hard time putting it down until the very end.  I absolutely hated the end of the bodk.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|This book makes you proud to be an American. I live 3 miles from Dam Neck base in Virginia Beach, and having this level of patriotism down the street gives me goosebumps. Highly recommended!!
034580404X|5.0|Very pleased with the items purchased. They came in perfect time, even before expected. I would def recommed youbto buy more items from this person.
B005GY0Y8S|5.0|Murder is bad enough that I have been editing movies that are not allowed to Brooklyn bridge and the dolphin and the death of his own site is this really good and the death medal eagles andwwe to Brooklyn bridge the death penalty for your business. This is stuff that's not
B0086700CM|5.0|It is pretty freaking fun and recommend it to all others. It's so fun<br />People. It's a game I played for hours
B009S33I68|5.0|Good book , too bad it was never declared a war ! All the men from that war should have fitting a HERO'S  welcome home.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It`s a good game, but I don't like when I get a new phone or tablet that my charaters have to be bought again and I lose my special ones.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Loved this book could not put it down I am such  SUCKER for love I would highly recommend this book
B009JZTOG8|5.0|I think that this is a wonderful show and I cannot wait till the next season comes out.  Just watch it and you will see too.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|I like it but it doesn't let u choose but it might at the ending because I really wanted to play as the zombies because I like the zombies more than the samurai :(
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I thought this was an amazing book that kept me on the tip of my toes! I absolutely loved the movie also, but the book is always always always better than the movie!!!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|In really good shape and quality!<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />I recommend anyone this product!<br /><br />Thank you so much!<br /><br />Sincerely, Kayla
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Seriously, I watched all three seasons in two weeks after all the kiddos went to bed and looked forward to it each night.  Now that it's over, I still miss it as my nightly ritual!  I'll just have to wait for season 4 to come out....patiently.  If anyone liked Deadwood (short lived but amazing!!) you'll like this too.  It's wonderful.
B004LWZW42|5.0|In really good shape and quality!<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />I recommend anyone this product!<br /><br />Thank you so much!<br /><br />Sincerely, Kayla
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I've loved each season so far, and this one is no different. It's wonderful - it's like the 'old days' when we could watch our &#34;stories-&#34;  get into the plot lines, invested in each character and in this case learn a little bit about the traditions of a time gone by.
B0054SMIH6|5.0|great, well written and plot was demonstrated very well actors were well prepared and showed there input well; by the attention they gave.the story.
1442444053|5.0|This is a very beautiful special edition of the classic Watership Down.  My God son had requested this book to read after he had seen the movie of Watership Down.  He said that he read the book straight through on Spring break.  He is 16 years old and loved this book.  I think that is the best recommendation.  The binding is excellent and the size of the letters are larger than most books and there is plenty of space between the lines and letters on the printed pages.  That makes the book especially easier to read for all reading abilities.  Thank you for carrying this special edition of the Watership Down.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Two thumbs up! Among the more transparent examples  of adolescent wish fulfillment I have ever read, but the author sure had my number. Bumps Fool on the Hill by Matt Ruff (set on Cornell's campus) from its perch atop the novels that spark the most nostalgia for my youth.<br /><br />Despite being a somewhat predictable exercise in adolescent geek wish fulfillment, Ready Player One is enlivened with an incredible number of 80s computer geek/gaming culture references that had me laughing out loud. Not quite as polished, erudite or mind-blowingly original as Neal Stephenson, Ernest Cline unfortunately feels compelled to over explain most of the references he introduces, as if striving to interpret \\"computer geek culture\\" for an audience of cultural anthropologists. It reminded me of the Deckard voice overs in the non-Director's Cut version of Blade Runner.. Ironically, Ready Player One references the Director's Cut of Blade Runner, which is the version that omits the annoying voice over, respecting its audiences ability to interpret the actions of the characters.<br /><br />An entertaining read especially for fellow survivors of growing up a computer geek in 80s and perhaps for those with computer geeks in their lives.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|We love this game. Me and my grandson play it all of the time. It gives us something to do when we go on the bus or subway. Great fun.
B000FBJHZS|4.0|I love brown's story telling ability and really enjoyed the book, however, it was a little far out in believability.
B006IYG5HE|5.0|As a connoisseur of Scandanavian police procedurals, I can declare this my favorite so far. Ranked up there with Scandanavian authors like Peter Hoeg, John Ajvide Lindqvist and Stieg Larsson. Harry Hole is a nicely flawed but brilliant hero.
1592537251|5.0|This wonderful book has influenced me and my art.  I see things differently now and want to sketch everything imsee.
0061733199|5.0|Haven't read the whole book yet - set up with easy-to-find info you want. The book is constructed like field-guides, with almost card-stock-like pages. This edition is not the pocket edition, but still fits just as easily, and not that heavy, into a BOB. This full-size is better for me since I need reading glasses anyway, and want a little larger print to see.  The vendor quickly delivered this to me in excellent condition. If I needed just one book on survival - this would be it.
B007THA4FI|4.0|J.K. ROWLING is an exceptional writer.  This first adult novel of hers proved her unique ability to draw the reader in through her detailed descriptions of characters and her talent for sucking you into her story.  While completely different from the Harry Potter series, it was one that I would definitely recommend!
034580404X|5.0|I had all three of these read within the week. Sad that its over, I should have read slower :( Missing Mr. Grey now.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really fun to play if u have a Facebook or not. If you have a Facebook you have to log in and u get to race all your friends that do play. If you don't have a Facebook it's still really ,awesome,fun,exciting,etc. So I recommend you get this app RIGHT NOW!!!!
B008LG6SXS|1.0|It keeps crashing no matter how many times I try it. If it gets fixed I'll come back and update my review.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|I had to reinstall the game 2 times. finally got to play n when it said social friends it died. then I had to re down load it again. then it froze up my kindle fire. just uninstalled it and gave up. I hope other people have better luck with it. it was a nice game while it lasted.
B004GCPJDQ|5.0|It is a must buy for me. I bought this as a gift, and this was two years ago. It is still working, it is still holding a good charge and the fact that it wirelessly charged is so cool. If you would like to give a gift to an Apple Fan, this would be a great gift.
B00785P2QC|3.0|Great awesome game but to play fast you need to buy the coins and investing g dollars other than that the game is pretty much easy
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I looked this book. It was such an emotional story and I was always cheering for Pat to get his life figured out, wondering all the while if he could. So many characters made the book so believable. I could hardly put it down.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|Alaska is an unforgiving state where one must be strong to live and survive. It is a beautiful state but it is full of dangers as well. This movie portrays those dangers and how one must be smart, aware, and prepared to face any of those dangers or to avoid them to live.<br /><br />The characters were well developed while some were typical.  The movie kept me on the edge of my seat and on an emotional roller coaster.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|This game has been extremely addicting and I find myself lost for awhile when playing. Graphics are decent for being a phone game. I downloaded it on a kindle as well, and it lags quite a bit. Still fun overall.<br /><br />For anyone looking to get the T-Rex, it appeared in my menu to buy at lvl 17 for 490 \\"bucks\\" (game bucks). If you download tapjoy and do all the free downloads for \\"bucks,\\" u don't have to drop a dime for the T-Rex!
B008602KQI|5.0|This movie was adapted from the book of the title and they did a good job of keeping fairly close to the book. One can never include everything. The movie and the book were originally meant for the teenage group but became an all ages overnight success. The story is original and riveting. It mirrors what could happen here in the United States but it reminded me of Russia, Bosnia, and other Slavic countries.<br />The character development was done slowly with surprises leaving the viewer to surmise answers. They left the ending open as to whether they will continue with the other two books into movies. Woodie's character needed more history. I wanted more only because I had read all the books.<br />The games, costumes, and the differences between the districts were well done. It was a very good movie but a sad one because of its topic. It left one with a lot to think about.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Fun game ; but , I suggest the parents don't hog all the action.  If you think its easy , play the higher levels.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love this series.  I got hooked on the characters right away.  Always anticipating what is happening next.  Reminds me of day time Soaps many years ago but more cleverly done and interesting.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|This is seriously the best show I have ever watched in my entire life.  It is one of the most epic shows I have ever seen.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|Clint Eastwood is not a great actor (very limited range), and here he surrounds himself mostly with amateurs and first-time actors (unlike in, say, Unforgiven in which he surrounded himself with great actors).  The acting is good enough, though.  The story in Gran Torino is so strong and so powerful that only the worst acting in history could possibly have hurt this movie.  I watched it two nights in a row and would gladly watch it again.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|*** Not For Family Night, too much skin is shown!  Also not for anyone who is under age - it's very graphic in it's adult content. ***<br /><br />Over all, yes, I give it 5 stars - they put alot of heart and soul into this movie and it shows.<br />  Our family holds \\"Les Miserables\\" high in our estimation and even have the Focus On The Family Radio Theatre Audio Drama of it.<br /><br />Reasons I would not watch this 2012 Movie Version again:<br />1. It may be accurate for the time in history...<br />However, We felt that the *low necklines, *bare bottoms and *sensuousness where a bit too much and over the top.<br />2. The Thénardier family has a lot to do with objectionable content found in the movie.  They almost made me want to quit watching the movie completely, but I forced myself to wait for a better part to come along.<br />3. Not Enough Dialog<br />Everything was a song - yes, it's a musical, but a lot of the excellent dialog was left out.  It is a beautiful story that deserved more talking.<br /><br />For these reasons, I will not be buying the DVD.
0439023513|4.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is absolutely amazing--a MUST read! Ms. Collins is a brilliant author. However, Mockingjay wasn't as gratifying as the other two books in the series... Don't get me wrong, I understand why certain things needed to occur in this book, but it seems as though Katniss always managed to have hope and/or something positive in her life in the other two books. This one was full of disappointments (for her) and not enough positive to balance them out. As for the ending, well, I feel somewhat cheated. It was rather vague and sort of rushed. Such an intricate plot, with so much going on throughout the series, only to have it end abruptly, without a feeling of true closure. All of what she went through would have been more worthwhile, if we would have gotten an all-inclusive, abundant ending... Nevertheless, I did enjoy reading this book-- but just not as much as The Hunger Games & Catching Fire...<br /><br />As a matter of fact, why cant' we have a 4th sequel with a more substantial ending? You know how they give us the bonus scenes that were cut in DVD's-- well maybe Ms. Collins could give us something like that in 'book form'... The Unabridged Mockingjay (there's your title!)

B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book starts slow as it builds it characters, but it becomes wonderfully engaging. Worth the read. Think I could pick this up in years to come and read again
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I also own her other book as well! Both her books have changed my life for the better!  I highly recommend this book to anyone wanting to declutter not just organize but actually declutter this book is for you!
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|I've looked for a kindle edition like league of legends for a long time and I found this one .Best game ever!!!
B001UGB1X8|2.0|I expected more from Tommy Lee Jones and John Goodman.  It was hard to follow and slow.  I would not recommend it.
B004Q3QRWC|3.0|I am an old man and I don't appreciate the unconventional way of telling this story .<br /><br />I like a story that develops along a straight line .  I don't like to make an effort at every chapter to meet new persons and to place them in a chronological order .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you need something to keep your mind busy for awhile then this is the game. Trying to collect things for your missions will keep you busy for hours.
B006ID01OS|5.0|This book gives a great grounding in the essential aspects of business strategy, though more experienced strategists would probably want a little more depth. It included some great case studies, though I found that some of the case studies (Apple and Ikea in particular) have already been studied extensively in the business press. Despite this, the book was definitely worth reading and I would recommend if to others.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|When people cluster together and issues raises between different groups, the story became more interesting than just zombie horror TV series
0425263908|5.0|Book received on time and in great condition.  Finished it already and just loved it.  Started next book and have the third one pre-ordered.

1439152802|5.0|Author: Kate Morton<br />Published by: Atria<br />Age Recommended: Adult<br />Reviewed By: Arlena Dean<br />Book Blog For: GMTA<br />Rating: 5<br /><br />Review:<br /><br />\\"The Secret Keeper\\" by Kate Morton was a very good long mystery, historical and romance read. But it was worth it. It was a good well written read with all of its history and its characters being very well developed, drawned,\\"sometimes sympathetic, maddening and not at all forgotten.\\" There will be many twist and turns so you will have to keep up with the storyline. Be ready to be taken from the present to the past and back as this mystery unfolds with this is taking place in London. We find that Laurel Nicholson who is now in her sixties will reflect back to 1960's in her teen years where a crime was committed by her mother, Dorothy who is now ninety and is dying. This was commited outside their 'Greenacres farmhouse.' Now this story will picks up from here going back and forth from the past to the present to where Laurel is driven to find answers to this crime. Laurel will seek answers from her scientist brother, who was a toddler at the time of this crime, to help solve this answer to their mother's secret. Be ready for family saga along with some historical drama in this murder mystery. You will be kept guessing till the end, at least it was for me, which makes this such a good well written story. Wow! what a surpise ending!<br /><br />Would I recommend? YES, especially if you are into a good historical mystery read...then this read would be for you.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Best series I have seen in a long time. Even my husband loves it and he is a rough critic. Would highly recommend.
B003KJ7GE6|5.0|Lots of chemistry among the actors. Lots of talent within the group. The plot subplots and carrying out these parts...amazing!!!<br />If you're a Colin Firth Fan, you will appreciate the subtle and not so subtle &#34;drops&#34; encompassing some of his previous works~This is a GREAT movie and I am SO happy I bought it so I can re-watch it ;) ...and it's STILL funny~ I loved the characters and its fast pace and the side plots and the actors! ABSOLUTELY BRILLIANT!! :)
B0058VW36U|5.0|What a wonderful game. Will keep you entertained for hours.....very addictive. A great game for all ages to play.  I find that I can't put my kindle down once I start.
B00BOLE7X0|5.0|While there were a few errors in fact (for example, Lincoln was laid cross-wise on the bed that was too short for him after the assassination), this was a wonderful portrayal of Lincoln. As a person who actually LIVES in the Lincoln areas, we chuckled at the famous story of the old woman who murdered her husband and was tried in the Metamora courts. If you have visited the Lincoln sites in Springfield, especially the new museum, this film brings to life the history that is preserved there. Great story, great acting, and I even could get over Sally Field playing Mary Todd Lincoln (although I have to admit, her characterization of Sybil sometimes came to mind!)
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Rocks and is way easier to use than iTunes. Most of the time is much cheaper as well. Love amazon
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|This is not an unbiased review. The musical is definitely my favorite so I was pleasantly disposed to begin with. That being said, this adaptation succeed where others (say &#34;Mama Mia&#34;) failed in bringing the &#34;feel&#34; of the stage to the screen. While my music friends were disappointed with the emphasis on close-ups, I really liked that because the lyrics were much more understandable. Loved the cast and kudos to Anne Hathaway. I don't understand the animus people have for her. She did a great job. Actually, everyone did because at the end of the film, you walk away with the same feeling in your gut that you felt when you saw the stage production. Bravo.
B000MQC9H4|5.0|One of the best movies I have seen in a long time.  I would reccomment this book to anyone wishing to buy it.
B00BHU2A7I|4.0|I personally love Marnie North by Northwest Rear Window Vertigo but Paycho is most riveting love iceberg blondes casting  Hitchcock collaboration galore
B00BESJYAY|5.0|Just a great movie.  Nothing about it was unbelievable yet it was inspiring.  I especially enjoy the lack of computer generated special effects.  If they were there, I didn't notice them.  Frosty is someone we middle-age men can all inspire to be like.  Disciplined but still trying to put all of life's pieces together in a way those who love us can understand and be proud of.
0425263908|4.0|This book was awesome. Can't wait to read the rest of the series. Finished the book in one day. Was so much better and more realistic than Fifty Shades.
1452101248|5.0|So far we have randomly tried 5-6 meals from this cookbook.  So far they have all exceeded our expectations.  The ingredients can be tough to find, but it is definitely worth the hunt. Best cookbook I have ever purchased,
B005LAIIHG|5.0|Great movie, the storyline was neat liked the way it was told. Liked the fact that they didn't go overboard with the GCI effects and when they were used they were awesome.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I was intrigued with all 3 of The Hunger Games books,this particular book I think was  the best. I couldn't stop reading!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Completely fun game for all ages. Can't get enough of this, I actually found a game I'm good at currently ranking first place with over two million points.
0765322889|5.0|Gardens of the Moon is your first gateway into the Malazan universe, one as rich and varied as any in fantasy literature, a portal to a world crushed under the weight of untold pasts - one forged from immense magical clashes, falling civilizations, and innumerable battles - all brought to life through a superbly complex tale told from multiple character perspectives.<br /><br />From top to bottom the entire world of Malazan is carefully crafted from an artist's hand, revealing unique nuances and unexpected surprises at every turn.
0307951529|5.0|A great read from start to finish.Not a fluff piece, actual good story examples and ideas.Would recomend to anyone looking to start their own busines
B009AMANBA|5.0|This film contains many layers of complexity and moral depth, and the performances were up to the task.  Each of the characters faces excruciating dilemmas, moral choices that give us a far more complex view of this time than the simple view of history about which we are accustomed to hearing.  This is a serious grown-up film, and unlike Argo, it is 95% accurate.
B004021J68|4.0|I love the versatility--these are great as church shoes as well as to play in the dirt (and wash well).  These fit my daughter with a normal foot, but my other daughter has a narrow foot and they are too loose, even though she has worn the clog style for years with no problem.  Nearly a 5 star due to the fit.
B00BEIN9VO|4.0|I genuinely love the album.  As a child of the '80s who grew up with Michael Jackson and synthpop this is right down my alley.  This review is more a critique of the vinyl packaging than the music itself.<br />Obviously with the length it is a double.  The cover on the vinyl is a bit different.  When the gatefold is opened there is only a black and white photo on the inside.  Deep down I was hoping for some sort of inner booklet, like the one in \\"The Sound Remains the Same,\\" but that would be pretty costly in this day and age.<br />The vinyl itself is nice and heavy.  Not fully sure if it is the proper 180 gram stuff, but it feels more like a vintage album from the '60s than the cheap flimsy stuff they were pressing in the '80s.<br />The inner sleeves have the big holes in the center that allow you to read the labels without pulling the records out.  I could see this being handy with a double album like this, but I would really rather have full sleeves with some printing on them.  I find the holes in the middle tend to catch the vinyl when taking them in and out, which is irritating to me.<br />The sound is proper, it sounds nice and rich on my record player.  The bass is good and deep.  My treble is a bit off, but the cartridge I am using is original to my equipment and over 30 years old, so I'd blame that before the record.<br />All in all I simply love it.  There may be a few things I would rather have with the vinyl packaging, but when it comes down to it the music is simply enjoyable.  Being able to play it on my dads old record player, and watching my two year old daughter dance to it is a very special treat indeed.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|its only the best and thats all i will use.<br />been building machines for 25+ years.<br />AGAIN ARTIC SILVER IS THE BEST !!
0307949486|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this series of books.  Stieg Larsson did a great job with this and his other books.  The characters are believable, tough and gritty.  The plot is intriguing and will keep the reader wondering what's next throughout the story.  Great work!
B002MQYOFW|3.0|This is a fast read even for young readers. The story is similar to many sci-fi stories from the early 1950s - a post apocalyptic society emerges. In this story that society might be worse than the prior one. The theme of his story does not really hold up to scrutiny. There are too many things wrong with the premise and it annoys you that they are not addressed.<br /><br />The writing itself is not all that bad. The author makes the story skip along.but it quickly become apparent what the ending will be.<br />I am not driven to read the second volume.
0470474874|5.0|I really depend on this series of technical manuals.  I have used this series of Office books and found them to be invaluable.  They are written well enough that a novice user can understand them while at the same time being helpful to a power user.  If you are doing hardcore Microsoft Office work, having a separate book for each product is definitely worthwhile and worth the expense.  I definitely recommend this product!
B001ANSSDC|3.0|Hoping the movie lives up to all of the hype!!  Was expecting more I guess.  Easy read for a rainy day

B0064X7FVE|5.0|Wonderful, great program use the program every day. Good information for different zip codes. Love the warning system.it will be wonderful for hurricane season.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|This DVD would not play on my sony DVD player.  I had to view the DVD on my computer.  None of the English words that were displayed to tell what the foreigners were saying,  did not display on the screen.
B0019N8P2W|5.0|Daria its probably one of the greatest animated series of all times<br />These dvds include all the sarcasm and humor double sense (not sexual)<br />But dont include the original sound track of the mtv broadcasting, but you really dont miss it
B00499QUK2|5.0|If you enjoy Sherlock Holmes at all you will absolutely love this version.  Benedict Cumberbatch and Martin Freeman are magnificent and Moriarty is played with an edge that steals the show when he's on screen.  I can't recommend this series enough!
B001QTXM5Y|5.0|This movie mix very well all the darkness of the comic history with the Hollywood requirements (movie time, budget, efx etc)<br />I like it very much; I read the comic and this movie reflex the writers idea<br /><br />recommended to the watchmen readers and the people to want to find something more in a movie that some efx and explotions
B008133MDK|5.0|Season 1 was brilliant.  Season 2 is even better!  The story of Holmes has been told in so many different ways and this version very well may be the best of them all.  The writing is just brilliant and the acting is as good as it gets!  I can't wait for Season 3!
B002N5N4M6|5.0|All the season sarcasm and science in a few DVDs<br />great purchase!<br />A must have for the Big Bang Theory fans
B00AREIAI8|5.0|The graphics on this game are amazing way better than any otherhorsegame I found. This is a must for all horse lovers
B0025KVLTM|5.0|Only the best LP in the history<br />the remastered sound its really good; I own the old cd, and this remastered sound its really superior; I dare to say that is better that the vinyl LP (I own it too)
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Martin delivers again. I just hope we dont have to wait too long for the next books. Not many people liked the last two books butni thought they were great. This is just the icing on the cake
B00AGOGOLE|2.0|I really didn't like this App, I thought it would be a better quality picture being an HD camera. But the pictures were very pixelated.
B0013FSL3E|5.0|This movie can be watched by anyone and they will love it. Glad to have my own copy to watch whenever I feel like watching a great film.
B00C10N3EW|5.0|another great by joe--wish he played more in the USA--i have seen live only two times-great show man-worth seeing his music covers so many wide ranges of music
B009IEXKXI|5.0|I hate writing reviews. Not good at it. Hate doing it. But - this book really is the best that I have read in years, better than even some of my old favorites (for example Ender's game).  The book is fascinating in the same way that Apollo 13 (the movie) is, where engineers are actually the \\"heros\\" and good old human innovation is at the forefront. The main character seems very real and the humor is awesome -  had me laughing out loud at points.  Just a unique combination.  Please, write more! I will be a buyer!!! I was very disappointed when I found this was your only book....
B002DW92T8|5.0|I read this book in the fall of 2011, but I need to go back and re-read it. Dan Pink explores what really motivates people and then applies it to multiple settings (business, education, research, etc). The book is easy to read and, more importantly, easy to connect to as a reader. I could definitely relate to some of the motivational signposts he explores and I was able to apply some of those thoughts to my classroom as a teacher.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I already loved the story and musical. I've enjoyed the other movie adaptations. But the live singing in this version sets it apart from the rest.
B002IKLNW4|4.0|Bill Bryson became a favorite of mine after I read &#34;A Walk in the Woods.&#34; I love his narrative style and witty humor as he describes his adventures. The Lost Continent wasn't as memorable as some of the others, but it was still fun to read.
B009IF8CH6|5.0|It's not easy to develop a show that is funny, smart, well written, and well acted but The Big Bang Theory does it!  Take any two characters from the show and put them together.  Bang!  You've got comedy!  Add new characters and, Bazinga!  More comedy without diminishing the original stars of the show!!  Watch this show!  It's one of the best!!!
B0081J9OWC|3.0|This is a good buy, but personally, I'm not as into this album as I was into their debut. The music is even more folky (gritty?), but it didn't resonate as much.
B00785P2QC|3.0|I would recommend this app for anyone that needs to be involved oj their game. the one thing I would have them change is the goal popup. it gets annoying to look at.
B00BK5D95C|5.0|I heard of Alt-J from my brother, and I have to say, this is one of the best albums I've heard in a very long time. The groove they manage to build into each song is phenomenal and they carry the energy through the whole album. Definitely worth the buy.
B008Y1KQEW|4.0|Loved the recipes, not so much the designs, but got the greatest cookie ideas from this book, not the internet! If you're a cookie decorator, read it!
B005FISBTO|5.0|Gave as a gift for christmas to my cousin.  She is the Dexter fan.  Don't watch the show myself. Good
B000YJ54DU|5.0|Reacher never disappoints the reader. The heart of the story is always fresh and moves fast.  No. 13 here I come.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I have really enjoyed playing this. It is easy for all ages. it is very close to the state fair game that I use to play as a child. It's entertaining, fun and easy!
B0001V6ZJ8|5.0|I remember watching this movie as a small child.<br /><br />Even then I could appreciate a touching movie. Even then I could understand his pain and suffering caused because he was different after suffering his childhood accident.<br /><br />I would recommend this movie to anybody, especially younger people who may not have had the chance to see it otherwise.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Such a good game for all ages. Dont have to buy anything its all free. Should make another kind of subway surfers, its so good!
B005K17RU0|5.0|Great app,! I recommend it. I check the app for my golf days and for when we plan for the beach. It seems to be pretty accurate so far.
B005CRQ3NY|5.0|This book is better than the first three. It was one of the funniest books I ever read,and I bet the rest are going to be just as funny!!!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway Surfers is a great game, because it is very fun and it is a bit challenging for moving to trains and rolling and jumping.I am really enjoying this game and many others would agree.
B003Y5H5HO|5.0|Excellent  american adaptation of the Swedish series, can't wait for the next 2 chapters in the series as it is rumored to be in the works.
B00B4804KS|5.0|Surely you're familiar with Steven Spielberg's \\"Jurassic Park\\" by now. It pretty much brought dinosaurs to life for the current 21-30 year old demographic all across the globe. A man named John Hammond (Richard Attenborough) has created a theme park full of cloned dinosaurs called Jurassic Park on an island near Costa Rica. Hammond invites paleontologist Dr. Alan Grant (Sam Neill), paleobotanist Dr. Ellie Sattler (Laura Dern), and chaos theorist Dr. Ian Malcolm (Jeff Goldblum) to the island in hopes of getting their endorsement for the park to be safe for the public to keep lawyers like Donald Gennaro (Martin Ferrero) off his back. Naturally, a park full of freaking dinosaurs wasn't the best idea and things don't go according to plan. \\"Jurassic Park\\" is being released in theaters in 3D to commemorate the film's 20th anniversary.<br /><br />Maybe it's because there's memories bouncing around in the back of this old brain of seeing this film originally in theaters at the ripe young age of nine or that revisiting the film on Blu-ray last year was just as spectacular as seeing it all those years ago, but personally speaking \\"Jurassic Park\\" never gets old. Seeing the film on a gigantic IMAX screen, with a modern movie theater quality surround sound system, and in 3D is almost like seeing the film again for the first time.<br /><br />John Williams score is as epic as ever. It seems to gleefully boom out of the movie theater speakers. All of the emotional, breathtaking, and memorable sequences still have the same impact after 20 years; Dr. Grant's scene where he confronts the kid who called a raptor a \\"six foot turkey\\" with a retractable talon is still fantastic, Dr. Grant's awesome view of children, the way the film made Barbasol cans seem cool, Samuel L. Jackson having most of his hair, mountains of dinosaur droppings, \\"You didn't say the magic word,\\" Robert Muldoon being a complete bad ass in short shorts, adding a new meaning to a \\"Danger 10,000 Volts\\" sign, and still getting choked up on their initial arrival to the park (\\"They're moving in herds!\\").<br /><br />Hearing the raptors screech in an IMAX theater is one thing, but the T-Rex scenes are just incredible. That immense roar and its massive footsteps are even more amazing in this atmosphere. It is worth the price of admission for the T-Rex scenes alone. Even though the film has been around for 20 years, it's amazing that the special effects are still quite good even by today's standards.<br /><br />\\"Jurassic Park 3D\\" is like being reunited with an old friend; an old friend that wants to eat you and maul you to death, but still. A classic is reborn in glorious IMAX with a vibrantly stunning use of 3D. \\"Jurassic Park\\" is one of those special films that can stand the test of time.getting choked up on their initial arrival to the park (\\"They're moving in herds!\\").<br /><br />Hearing the raptors screech in an IMAX theater is one thing, but the T-Rex scenes are just incredible.

B005I64U5C|5.0|If you like super hero movies you will enjoy Green Lantern! Ryan Reynolds and Blake Lively were charismatic together. This is not super suspenseful but still a great movie with brilliant colors. The 3D is amazing too!
B0018J2QB8|5.0|Season 2 was even better than Season 1.  I can't wait to see Season 3.  Twists and turns on every episode.
B00ATPVA78|4.0|This was a great adventure game, with not a lot of hidden object puzzles, but the ones they did have tied into the story very well.  The only drawback was it wasn't very long.
B009GX6SSK|4.0|I realize NCIS:LA is about &#34;Special Projects&#34; but I've never understood what it has to do with the US Navy. The original NCIS always deals with justice within the Armed Forces.  I find many of the plots of NCIS:LA too involved in espionage and world terrorism and very little to do with justice for members of the US Navy or Marine Corps and therefore my interest often wanes.  And doesn't Deeks ever get a haircut or shave? However the presence of Linda Hunt, LL Cool J and especially Chris O'Donnell manage to breathe enough life into some of the more tedious plots.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|This movie is \\"based on a true story\\".  That does not mean it needs to follow the true story and follow the events as they actually unfolded.  I read the 1 star reviews and that seemed to be the most common complaint. I lived thru the hostage period and the Dateline countdown.  It was a frightening period for the US and the hostages.  The anger displayed in the movie against the US by the Iranians is simmering in the same manner in the mid east now.<br />I think that Ben Affleck did a very good job in releasing the tension that was building with the angry scenes by using small humor with Alan Arkin and John Goodman.  Just a little lightheartedness, nothing over the top. I am surprised this movie received the Best Movie Oscar.  But, I guess, he and George had paid their dues according to the Academy and it was their \\"time\\".  Don't get me wrong, it was a really good movie, I'm just not sure it was a Best Picture Movie.
0316228532|2.0|While the characters in this book were well developed there was not one of them that was likeable or relatable.  There are a lot of good books out there containing tremendous sadness and little to redeem it, but most contain at least one character that the reader can appreciate or relate to.  The Casual Vacancy has none of that.  The characters were all so self absorbed and ignorant of how their lives and feelings impacted those around them that I really didn't care what happened to any of them, even little Robbie.  One reviewer likened this story to Peyton Place.  While I can see the parallel, Peyton Place was a much better story overall.  I'm glad I received this book as a gift and didn't spend the money on it myself.  It will not remain part of my library, I will donate it to a library book sale.
1439190275|5.0|Great book.  The  Diet has changed somewhat from the original Atkins. Great for anyone considering a low carb life style.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Expertly written, with plenty of explanation for legal twists and turns, kept me interested non-top.  Couldn't put it down.  The characters were so well-defined, I couldn't help but identify with them and their emotions.  Highly recommended.
B000ID3KU6|1.0|Only made it through the first 40 minutes of this movie before I couldn't stand to watch it any longer.  Those 40 minutes were very boring and pointless - I figure if a movie can't catch my interest after 40 minutes it's not worth my time. Maybe you'll have more patience and at some point it will get interesting, but I wouldn't hold my breath.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|Great game works well on my kindle fire would recommend to anyone. playing this game on touch screen is fun and is almost easier then on anon touch screen computer.
1451675046|5.0|well written, clear and simple explanations for curious young people, and adults with no science experience. Evidence based answers for common questions about the world around us.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I did love the book & it kept me wanting to continue to read until I was done. Nothing like the movie though. Probably 10% like the movie. Definitely reading the rest of the series.
034580404X|5.0|I write a local book review about once a month. I had heard this book described as \\"porno\\" and never once considered reading it. Just wasnt my cup of tea. But flash to December 2012 and our end of year paper was due and my colleague kept pressuring me to read it and write an honest review. She finally said \\"read ten pages and if you really hate it - say so in your review\\". I dont care.<br /><br />So, I started reading the first book and just fell in love in Ana. She is like so many young girls - shy and have no idea of their real value. After page ten I was hooked. The books do have a lot of sex but from memory and my first lover - so did we. But this book is about so much more than the sex - it is a love story. Two people who met and literally could not stay away from each other. Would risk anything for the other and only want to make that one person  happy. The fairy tale we all search for. And throw in friends and a few bad guys and Ms. James has written the \\"perfect\\" novel.<br /><br />I gave this book the number 1 slot on our small review for 2012. Hope she continues this story. Would love to know what happens to Christian and Ana through the years.
B009G78EE2|5.0|I've never been a huge fan of rap and hip-hop; it's just not the genre that fits me best. That being said, Macklemore could make any hip-hop/rap hater an ecstatic fan. His words are so meaningful. Not only can you hear the pain and struggle he's gone through in his life, but you can also easily relate to the words he speaks. Each song is so unique and no two sound like copy-cats of each other. Macklemore and Ryan Lewis are an amazing duo that fill songs with an infectious beat and inspiring lyrics. Unlike some popular albums these days, The Heist has many stand out songs other than the singles that everyone hears on the radio such as \\"Thrift Shop\\" and \\"Same Love\\". The entire album is so deep and cohesive and no one song is a turn off. Macklemore is a true artist and Lewis helps make this gorgeous art come to life.

B00A3NQNUU|4.0|its a fun addictive game that I highly suggest for everyone. I love to control what I'm doing and how it looks and this game is great for that. but it only allows 3 friends and you don't get to chose what friends it is.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I got this game for free and, while they're sometimes hit or miss, this game is great! It's not terribly complicated and doesn't require a lot of skill, but it really passes the time. Think I'm hooked!
B0064MPXFA|5.0|The cast, level of acting, plots. They always show the good side of Chicago weather.<br />Very credible story line and the writers of the story line clearly wanted to jab the judishial<br />(Judges) system. FUNNY!
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Could not put this book down. I laughed and cried at many points in this book. Heart breaking storyline, definitely worth reading.
B008602KQI|5.0|So sit down, thinking this will be some teenage drivel - and halfway into the movie I realize two things; an hour just zipped by and I'm riveted by this little girl (Jennifer). It's still Running Man-meets-1984-meets-Logan's Run, but oh, so much better.
0446343129|5.0|I just got done reading Sugar Blues in two sittings and I have to say that it was much more informative and insightful than I originally thought it was going to be. I knew of course that it was going to be about how sugar isn't good for you and what can happen if you consume too much. But this book is about so much more than that. It covers the history of our love/hate relationship with this product, how the outcries of those who learned about its true effects were suppressed by those selling it to the masses, and how it was able to make its way into nearly every facet of our eating lives despite the negative effects of it that so many people are feeling today. This is one of those books that the average person would not want to read because it presents undeniable truth that demands real long-term change.
B007R3AZNK|5.0|Highly recommend this CD.from J. Bonamassa.  Great songs, many original.  You can't go wrong with any Bonamassa CD.  He's quite the artist.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|I can't think of a single bad thing to say about The Beatles' amazing debut album. After their first chart topping single proved them worthy (\\"Please Please Me\\"),EMI Records demanded that they release their first long player. Producer George Martin booked a day long session at EMI on February 11, 1963, and the plan was to record ten songs for this album. The industry standard was 14 songs per album, 7 on each side. Since the plan was to capitalize on their big hit song \\"Please Please Me\\", it was decided that both sides of their first two singles would be included. With the exception of a couple of George Martin piano overdubs, the remainder of the album would be recorded in this day long session.<br /><br />The resulting album is what you have here. A potent mixture of rockers (\\"I Saw Her Standing There\\", \\"Boys\\") and ballads (\\"A Taste Of Honey\\". \\"Baby It's You\\"), The final song recorded for the album was saved for last for a reason. \\"Twist And Shout\\" was one on which John Lennon had to scream his vocals. John had a terrible cold that day, and they knew that recording \\"Twist And Shout\\" would be a problem for him unless they saved it for last.<br /><br />Many Beatles fans disagree over which mix of the album is better. The mono mix (only available in the boxed set \\"The Beatles In Mono\\") is thought to be superior to the stereo mix. I prefer the stereo mix, probably because this is the mix I grew up listening to. Mono or stereo, this is among the greatest debut albums of all time.
B00280LYIC|5.0|It was very existing. There was always some kind of Acton it was even existing at the they way the author wrote it.

B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My 17 year old daughter loves this movie. It is just an encouraging story about when you don't fit like everyone else or you want to change your life in some way. Good movie.
B001MVYUPC|5.0|Classic ,true life account of a man who literally died for non violent disobedience, a Hindu man who set the example for the world in modern times, emulating a man of more distant times who taught turning the other cheek. Gandhi has changed this world for the better, and this movie explains how it all happened.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|I'll admit I gave into the hype. I read all three...just to make sure I didn't miss the point where the story line and the writing got better.  Call me a fool but at least I can say with certainty that this book, along with the rest of the &#34;trilogy&#34;,is absolutely HORRIBLE.  I'm sorry I did as it's time I will never get that time (or money) back.  Soft porn written for 12 year olds.  Ghastly writing.  I'm not sure how it was able to get published.  I guess the target audience didn't care that the author wrote this for their daughters. If you're thinking about reading this...don't.  Please.  You'll end up doing the same thing I did, shaking your head in disbelief and disappointment that you're actually reading this piece of crap.
1419705849|5.0|He enjoyed this book. According to him, &#34;the characters are interesting and story is very funny.&#34;  I would suggest this book to a parent who wants their child to read comedy that is still considered 'clean.'
B008F9T76Q|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series.  My 8 year old son also enjoyed listening to the books on cd. So I also got it for my nephew
B00BESCJII|5.0|This movie very closely followed the book. A few scenes were cut out, most likely due to controversy and the fact that some people might find them offensive (the abortion scene and when you find out what's wrong with Charlie). Although these were omitted, the movie is still very close to the book. I highly recommend this movie.

0439023521|1.0|This must be an unexpected review with the opposite tone to most the good review here about the book. I think it just my mistake to buy the book coz I was tempted by the hype and the WOM about this book.. Unfortunately this is not the book for me, not my kind of book and more for younger readers, can't finish it, and sadly I cant have it to be traded-in here at Amazon..

0062014536|4.0|Originally Reviewed At: Mother/Gamer/Writer<br />Rating: 4.5 out of 5 Controllers<br />Review Source: Audible purchase<br />Reviewer: Me<br /><br />Well, I am so sad to see this series end. Especially since I discovered it so late. I loved being inside Lena's head. Hearing her thoughts and feeling her pain, I truly believed she was a real person and her troubles had become my hardships. She was a wonderful protagonist. Fun to watch. Entertaining to listen to. Moreover, her story was compelling and now that she's gone I miss her like a heartbeat.<br /><br />In Requiem, we are given a taste of Lena's continued struggle with losing Alex and the Invalids battle towards freedom. Told from dual perspectives of both Lena and Hana, we see how each girl adjusts to their new lives. Hana's story was both sad and inspiring. Even though she's cured, she is still fighting to find herself among people who only want her to shut up and do as she's told. Her pair Fred, was a complete jerk (although that's not really what I want to call him) and I loved how she learns to deal with him on the outside while secretly thinking of ways to get herself out of the situation on the inside. I think her character growth was something I didn't see coming and it slowly became one of my favorite parts of the novel.<br /><br />We also get a few surprise guests in the novel, which I won't spoil, and a few revelations for our characters to come to terms with. The only negative I have for the overall book is that there is no resolution to the love triangle. This, I think should have been resolved. I think for readers it would have given us more closure to the entire series instead leaving us panting and wanting more. I can understand though why it ended without her choosing but I still can't help but feel like something is missing. The whole novel is about love and the loss of love. And at the end, it should have ended with love. True love prevailing or new love winning. But that's just my opinion.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this series. The audiobooks are phenomenal and the narrators' voice engages you every second. I am thrilled this will become a TV show and I hope that Hollywood does it justice because as a trilogy, Delirium is EPIC./><br />Overall, I highly recommend this series.

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I liked this book and how it ended.  I can't put what I really think as it will spoil everything.
B004HW7JMO|4.0|Spartacus: Gods of the Arena was my first exposure to the larger Spartacus shows on Starz, and I have to say this series has a lot going for it. The main characteristic is that the episodes are entertaining, as there is almost nonstop fighting (that's what gladiators do, right?), sex (that's what gladiators and their masters do), and treachery (that's what the masters do best). Some of the dialogue was a little overdone and tended to pull me out of the story, but I didn't have to wait long before I was pulled back in again. Overall, best not to think too much--just sit back and prepare to be entertained.
B0031RS542|5.0|Good pace of the story and narrated very nice. The idea of the story is original and well developed throughout the book.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|I saw the name of the book in the credits of the  movie, Lincoln and knew I had to read it. It is very easy to read for a history book and am happy to have it on my Kindle.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|My 10 year old daughter loves this game.  She enjoys going to shows and playing with her horse!  It nice she has to take care of the horse before she can show it.
B00BEPVAV8|2.0|For starters (pun intended) it starts out way too fast.  The brakes don't work reliably and the stearring is much worse.
B0079XPUOW|4.0|A lot of reviews on here for this book complain that the story is too straightforward, doesn't come off as funny, is a rip-off of a rip-off of a bad idea, and just basically wasn't good.  Those reviews are wrong.  It's not often I am glad I spent money on a book, but after reading the first few chapters, I had to get the rest of the story, and I was not disappointed.  Yes, it's a ridiculous concept, but it's supposed to be.  Like the over-the-top acting of Captain Kirk, Redshirts goes even farther over-the-top to detail the life of the lowly expendable characters that surround us every day.  If you take the story too seriously, then you're reading it wrong.  It's fun, it's funny, it's full of plot holes (because it's supposed to be), and it's just a good, fun, fast read.  This story isn't about a space plot.  It's about a bunch of characters.  Just enjoy your time with them.  If you want a serious story with serious plot points, you're in the wrong place.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Can be confusing to get the hang of gameplay and goals. There's a help section but you kinda have to blindly navigate yourself through play. Just a fun little game to cure boredom.
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Diana Gabaldon is a mesmerizing, skilled writer whose vocabulary and imagery goes far beyond most modern authors.  She has researched not only Scottish history from the 1700s, but Scottish expressions, mannerisms, customs, accents, and Scots Gaelic.  The central love story is always compelling and the adventures are nail biters.  Love this hero and heroine, love this series!

B00000DG1R|4.0|The English quintet Duran Duran made their debut in 1981, around the time when music channel MTV was just taking off. While their debut single \\"Girls On Film\\" gave them significant exposure, they would hit paydirt with their song and album of the same name \\"Rio\\". Over the next decade, they racked up numerous pop hits, became teen idols and respected artists in one fell swoop. Depsite being looked at as pretty boys of the new wave era, their music has held up surprisingly well. To drive that point home, Capitol Records issued a greatest hits album- simply called \\"Greatest\\". The collection featured nineteen songs- most of which were their best known hits- that was released a couple of years after celebrating their fifteenth anniversary as a band. Despite a few personnel changes, the band still revolved around lead singer Simon LeBon, keyboardist Nick Rhodes and bassist John Taylor.<br /><br />On this greatest hits package, all the bases are covered. Starting with their work with Alex Sadkin (\\"Is There Something I Should Know\\", \\"The Reflex\\", \\"New Moon On Monday\\") and Colin Thurston (\\"Save A Prayer\\", \\"Rio\\", \\"Hungry Like The Wolf\\", \\"Girls On Film\\"). They also worked with the members of Chic- provided on separate occasions. Bernard Edwards produces the title track to the 1987 James Bond film \\"A View To A Kill\\", while Nile Rodgers oversees the production of the songs \\"Skin Trade\\", \\"Notorious\\" and \\"Wild Boys\\". Also included are the songs released from their underrated 1988 album \\"Big Thing\\"- \\"I Don't Want Your Love\\" as well as \\"All She Wants Is\\". Also on here are their comeback singles from 1993- \\"Ordinary World\\" and \\"Come Undone\\". Oddly enough, the only song that wasn't on here was their cover of Grandmaster Flash & The Furious Five's \\"White Lines\\" from their covers album \\"Thank You\\". Overall, Duran Duran's \\"Greatest\\" is a compilation that serves as a chronicle of a band that made music fun and enjoyable. While most of their creative risks would take place on their side projects (Arcadia, The Power Station), in the end they are still front and center when it comes to talking about legendary pop-rock bands.ojects (Arcadia, The Power Station), in the end they are still front and center when it comes to talking about legendary pop-rock bands.
B00992CF6W|5.0|the only thing I don't get is how to create the nether spanner thing I liked alpha beacause its almost neon green.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|Loved the characters, the drama the wit. Special effects are awesome. But what I liked the most is that the episodes are<br />self contained. You do not need to have watch the previous ones to enjoy each one. Although, all have a beginning and an end,<br />I couldn't stop watching one after the other.
8866130915|2.0|It has a softcover and does'nt has an address book.<br />I'm quite dissatisfied of the thing, but it probably was written somewhere.

B0092MKFIY|3.0|Got it because the song Radioactive is on a Pittsburgh Penguins hockey commercial & liked that song. The rest of the album isn't terrible just not mostly my type of music. Some of the other songs are good and I'm sure someone more into that type of music would like the entire album more. GO PENS!!!! I really do like Radioactive though....
B001RTP3YQ|5.0|I caught myself patting my hand on the table at the shop the other day when his music was playing in my head.  To me that says the music was great.
B00BWJ7LYG|4.0|Overall, it was better than the first movie of The Lord of the Rings Trilogy. And a I believe a broader audience will enjoy this more than LOTR.<br />Details:<br />This is a \\"must see\\" for LOTR and Tollkien fans, as for the rest of you, you will enjoy it to. There are significant reminders and similarities to the \\"Lord of the Rings: Fellowship of the Ring\\", but not enough to turn me away. There is a lighthearted whimsey and underlying/subtle humor to this movie that only Martin Freeman (Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy, 2005) can deliver. Freeman, in my option, was the perfect choice for the young Bilbo Baggins. This movie definitely lacks the \\"whininess\\" that Elija Wood brought to the LOTR series. The additional humor definitely opens this movie up to a broader audience than the LOTR series did but, so far, it still sticks to the epic storyline that Tollkien is famous for and won't leave his fans, like me, disappointed.<br />I must admit that I did not see this movie in the theater and that I was not highly anticipating it as I was with LOTR. Now I am kicking myself for that because, in my opinion, \\"The Hobbit: an Unexpected Journey\\" is off to a better start to The Hobbit series than The Fellowship was. Don't get me wrong.... The LOTR movies were fabulous, but I am definitely liking this one better. Mostly because I can only take Elija Wood for so long (9 hours pushes my threshold). But since Martin, as Bilbo Baggins, is a bit more adaptable and versatile an actor (and not whiney and pathetic like Elija Wood was as Frodo) makes it an easier more enjoyable movie to watch.<br />I would have given it 5 Stars if Jackson had not included Wood in the beginning. That is where the storyline strays and it was totally unnecessary. But I suppose Jackson did not have a choice in the matter and at least he kept Woods' cameo to a minimum.<br />Again, as he did with the LOTR trilogy, Peter Jackson delivers a visually stunning movie. But, In my opinion, the scenery in LOTR took thelead roll whereas, in this movie, the story line is more pronounced and you aren't distracted by the visuals.
B000TEUSJK|3.0|I ordered the unrated version as it is the only x-&#34;unrated&#34; motion picture produced with major actors in recent times. O'Toole, Mirren, Gielgud have &#34;disavowed&#34; their  parts in this film but here it is. Only McDowell acknowledges his part saying &#34;I performed as best I could and I'm not embarrassed &#34; (he played the part perfectly).<br />It's a cult classic.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|I am still completely dumbfounded that this film got bad reviews. The critics must have taken the brown acid. This was a great flick! It deserves more than a sequel .... it deservies a series of sequels. Action, great acting, great writing, and John Carter's CGI effects made Avatar look like a bad flip book animation. If you didn't see it, you missed out big time. And if you're a sci-fi geek who didn't see it, then you're not a sci-fi geek! The Edgar Rice Burroughs series of books that this film was based upon were the basis for ALL of the modern sci-fi we have today ... and the first book was published over one hundred years ago! John Carter did it all way before Captain Kirk and Luke Skywalker. Hollywood just wasn't advanced enough to recreate the world of Barsoom. Buy it, watch it, dig it! And watch it again, and again!

B0073COMUW|5.0|Being an EE, with a fascination for LED lighting in general, I've tried several brands and types of LED lights, and this is the best one I've tried yet. It's the brightest one I've seen by a pretty fair margin (I got the &#34;daylight white&#34;, which is a bit brighter but a bit bluer than the &#34;warm white&#34;). True, it does draw 10 watts, which is also quite high for an LED bulb, but the payoff is terrific. I've got three of these in my kitchen, which has one double-bulb fixture and a single-bulb fixture, and 30 watts worth of these bulbs is almost too much light, even for a kitchen.<br /><br />As other people have noted, the light dispersion pattern is fairly asymmetric, with quite a bit more light coming out from the top than from the bottom, but that hasn't been a problem. I've installed two of them in table lamps, and they do cast a lot more light upwards than down, but there's still a fair amount of light illuminating the tables. In downward-facing fixtures the light distribution pattern is a big advantage -- not much light is wasted by going upward into the fixture. Overall I think it's a very good design compromise...some light comes out the bottom, but the majority of the light goes upward (or vice versa if installed in a down-lighting situation).<br /><br />For just over ten bucks, it's hard to argue with the value. They aren't dimmable, but they're a lot cheaper and brighter than any dimmable LED bulb I've seen so far. Some people have apparently gotten defective units, but I ordered ten, I've installed eight of them so far and haven't had a single failure yet. DO NOT make the mistake of thinking that because they're not glass, they're not fragile -- they don't like being dropped any more than any other light bulb (they're electronic devices with PCBs and components similar to your iPod -- how would you feel if you dropped that on the floor?). And take the overheating warnings seriously too -- don't install them in fully-enclosed fixtures.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|it is really fun butt it won't let me updates it on my kindle fire for a while butt other that it is fun
B003NS2T9G|5.0|As the review says it is CSI meets the X Files  The chemistry with the characters is great! Aliens, Time Travelers but no goverment cover-ups!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Once I started reading, I could not put it down! What a beautiful ending, it actually made me tear. I definitely recommend this book.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|I'm only about halfway through but I can't put this book down.  I love historical fiction and this book is written in such a way that ties history in with the dynamic lives of several individuals.  Extremely well written.  I can't wait to read the entire trilogy!

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game sure does entertain me and lots more and its just really fun. Ill play this on the bus in the car at school everywhere.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|Great show, addictive themes and characters that keep you engaged and wanting to watch more.  Obviously we did, as we purchased this episode since it's no longer available On Demand anymore.  One more episode of Season 1 and we're on to Season 2.  A show of intrigue, suspense, in-fighting between feuding families and so much more.  Game of Thrones is terrific!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Very happy with being able to watch the entire season in one sitting. The series is very entertaining for me.
B00AKFG15S|5.0|Just as I anticipated this third in the Clifton Chronicles saga was right on the money.  The saga rolls on just as interestingly as many on the established canaon.  J.A. keeps the suspense sizzling and I love it.

1878424319|5.0|I learned about this book after watching the author on Opah.  It makes you think, look deeper inside yourself and enlightened me about things stuck in my mind way of thinking.  It is a process to keep the 4 agreements, I keep them posted nearby to remind me and encourage me to be a better person and love me.  Wonderful
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I love this movie.  This is the only movie I have seem so many times and never tire of it.  Th added scenes in the 3 disc is fantastic.  it really brings it together.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Its a lot like temple run and is way fun! Being able to compete against your friends just makes ot even better
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a great game, it is very addictive. I like the way that they update it to another country on the tour each month or so. Very fun. The only annoying thing is that the boards and characters are really expensive. Good graphics as well. I would recommend this game to everyone.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|love it! great jewel game. wish there was more to the ' story's Took me awhile to figure out I could use the items at the bottom to help!
B00AH8FTT2|5.0|never disappointed in Jeffrey Archers books. I am sure there will be more of the Clifton family written about, As Seb and Jessica are growing up into interesting chadacters I do hope so.
B004GUSG4M|5.0|Great book! Easy read, but still full of suspense and surprise! I would love to see this as a movie!
B001NLKT60|5.0|Very nice book. The first of its kind. I like many of the problems that are available to remember. Salamander is my favourite character.
B008G12ERC|5.0|1) I have never taken music appreciation and I grew up in the 80's<br />2) Music in itself is not just audio but the memories that we attach to is subconsciously and unconsciously that make it unique.  So each viewpoint can skewed by the perception of the reviewer.<br />Here are my two cents.<br /><br />If you are buying this because Muse is &#34;The best group Ever&#34; than you will be happy.  They change from album to album like most growing and changing in taste and refining a style of art that they enjoy but once again they do not disappoint with this newest album.<br /><br /> If you are buying this album because you heard the song Madness and you found yourself singing it in the car or  music fills your home while you do other things and you need to 'connect' to feel that it's a good song then you might feel yourself going to skip tracks.  You might be the type of person that ends up not playing the whole album.  aka.  a person that needs to sing along to the music while they clean. Perhaps listen to each track preview before committing to the album.<br /><br />If you treat  an album like an opera that must be heard in its entirety to be enjoyed with each song being a new act in the flow of the record than you will most likely enjoy this album.  Muse has always done a wonderful job of creating flow in there albums.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's a ton of fun recommended to all ages above seven. The most exciting part is when your flying over the cool sites in a jetpack.
B000SZK41M|5.0|I am not a critic by any means.<br /><br />The storyline fits well with the hook in the first 10 minutes and the rise and fall of the story is very well done.  I did not lose interest or come out of the submersion of the movie.  Bruce Willis did a wonderful acting job particularly in his ability to portray the element of overcoming all odds. Reginald VelJohnson was also brilliant in his role as the Sgt. Al Powell.  The connection between the two is right in line with the way friends are forged in times of battle.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I loved Fringe from beginning to end.  What else can I say?  Highly recommend to anybody who likes science fiction.
B00BDZV9M4|4.0|I actually like the album, it was better than \\"Tha Carter IV\\" and definitely better than \\"I am not a Human Being 1\\". I\\"m a huge Wayne fan and to be honest I really didn't expect this to be as good as it is. Most of the beats were GREAT and it seems like his metaphors and snap lines are coming back to him...from his first 3 Carter albums !!! Watch out world, the martian has landed !
B008ZDC7M8|4.0|I liked the depth and comprehensiveness of the coverage. The interviews, though, varied a lot in quality of information. Overall it's a bargain.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|I was hesitant to buy until I finally saw on the full Amazon website that the latest update has fixed the bug causing crashes on many 8.9&quot; KFHDs. I am loving this game so far! Just what I was looking for!
B005HJWWW8|1.0|I bought this unit to use with an iPod nano that I use at work. About the only good thing I can say about this is that it functions. But it does not function very well.<br /><br />Tested with 2 different headsets: Audio Technica ATH M40's, and Sony MDR-NC40's. Yes, they are very different.<br /><br />The Audio Technica is a circumaural flat response studio headset, and the Sony is a light weight on-ear noise cancelling headset, with its own built-in noise cancelling preamp. The AT headset doesn't need noise cancellation; it is closed back, and just putting it on cancels a lot of ambient sound (more than the Sony). However, what the Sony lacks in ambient sound cancellation, it makes up for with light weight, and a really nice preamp/EQ. It requires a triple-A battery, a minor annoyance if you prefer everything to be rechargeable.<br /><br />The Sony headset does a far better job of tweaking the sound of an Ipod nano than any of the EQ settings on the Fiio amp, EVEN if I use the Fiio inline with the Sony headset. I mean, its not even a close comparison. The two usable EQ settings on the Fiio? EQ1 muffles the high end and is too boomy, without really amplifying the low end. EQ2 is a better low-high balance, but is still lacking on the bottom end response. There is just one setting on the Sony, and it blows the Fiio away.<br /><br />Certainly, the Audio Technica sounds much better plugged into a computer. Even using Media Player, I can tweak the sound and bring the volume up so the music is much better quality (blowing the Sony away). But that wasn't really the point of this exercise. It is also a larger headset, something you don't want to walk around with (pretty hilarious walking to the restroom with an 11 foot cord in tow).<br /><br />Amplification? Not so much. I heard about 1-2 dB improvement with the volume cranked all the way up. I had to take the Fiio out of line and put it back in a few times to really make sure, but it really doesn't put out a lot of volume. And that is true for both headsets (not just the Audio Technica, which is arguably power hungry).<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a waste of 30 bucks. Don't bother.And that is true for both headsets (not just the Audio Technica, which is arguably power hungry).<br /><br />Bottom line: This is a waste of 30 bucks. Don't bother.

B00A1EOBJQ|1.0|Nice of Mr Burnett to care so much. Apart from that is his UK customers who can't even download the mp3 of Fade into you, even though I bought the US version for that very reason.<br /><br />Its actually a 4 star album.
B00APJLY0Q|4.0|I liked it, my fiance really liked it, and our 2 children watched it many times. Def some LOL moments in it for the adults and a good moral.
0375842209|4.0|\\"She was a girl.<br />In Nazi Germany.<br />How fit­ting that she was dis­cov­er­ing the power of words.\\"<br /><br />The Book Thief by Aus­trian author Markus Zusak is a novel tak­ing place in Nazi Ger­many. The book was pub­lished in 2006, since then it has won many awards and spent over 230 weeks on the New York Times Best­seller list.<br /><br />Liesel Meminger meets Death at the age of 9 when she attends the funeral of  her brother.  Werner died on a long train trip them to Molch­ing, Ger­many to a fos­ter fam­ily which will dis­tance the chil­dren from their Com­mu­nist par­ents. At the funeral is when Liesel, an une­d­u­cated illit­er­ate, steals her first book.<br /><br />Death con­tin­ues to nar­rate the book, he sees Liesel's rela­tion­ship with her fos­ter par­ents, her neigh­bor­hood, a Jew­ish fist fighter and Rudy Steiner, a boy her own age. Along the way Liesel stum­bles on more books, many of which she steals and become a sooth­ing voice dur­ing the Allies bombardments.<br /><br />The Book Thief by Markus Zusak is a very pop­u­lar novel, mainly among the YA crowd, and I can cer­tainly see why. The book cel­e­brates the power of the writ­ten word, of lan­guage, encour­ages peo­ple to read has an inter­est­ing twist in the narration.<br /><br />The book approach to the Holo­caust, not straight on but look­ing from the side­lines, will appeal to teens as well as adults. The young hero­ine, Liesel Meminger who is a feisty girl who nav­i­gates through the claus­tro­pho­bic and schiz­o­phrenic world of adults in Nazi Ger­many is both smart and tough, with admir­ers and haters. All the char­ac­ters occupy Molch­ing, a small town which tries to keep out of the huge events sur­round­ing it, the near­est city (Munich) and the near­est con­cen­tra­tion camp (Dachau), both rich and poor strug­gle through their daily chores, hop­ing to have enough money for a few bites at the end of a long day.<br /><br />The book itself is geared toward young adults on the cusp of full fledged adult­hood. The book's nar­ra­tor, Death, is sorry for what he has to do, his \\"boss\\" expects him to do the impos­si­ble and mankind keeps feed­ing him \\"clients\\". Most of the vio­lence and blood­shed we asso­ciate with the Nazis is masked by sym­bol­ism or metaphors.<br /><br />As I'm sure any intel­li­gent reader have already fig­ured out, books play an impor­tant part in the story. How­ever, the one book the pro­tag­o­nist didn't steal plays a very impor­tant and unex­pected part - Mein Kampf. Hitler's book helps to save a Jew­ish man, Max Van­den­burg and it is then used to make an entirely new book.  The con­nec­tion between the lit­tle girl and the Jew­ish out­cast is forged on a new book built and writ­ten on the pages of Mein Kampf.<br /><br />The strength of the book is its wit and under­stated hor­ror. Death has a sense of humor, a keen eye and a lit­er­ary out­look (\\"For me, the sky was the color of Jews\\").  It is an impres­sive book and I appre­ci­ate Mr. Zusak's abil­ity, but a few lesser moments of the author try­ing to get the audi­ence to tear would have worked for its favor..<br /><br />The book itself is geared toward young adults on the cusp of full fledged adult­hood.

B00B2DSK06|3.0|Took other kids wanting to see it for my son to want to see it again. He is 3. Even the 8 yr old only kind of likes it. If you are an adult that has played video games, arcade or console, there are lots of time you will smile relating to old time and modern games. But kids wont get it.
B00BWJ7LYG|3.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I loved the book as a child, but honestly, I am not sure it took me 9 hours to read!  I appreciate the attention to detail in the movie, but 3 movies at almost 3 hours each somehow feels like a drag.  I put off watching this one BUT I loved it.
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Didn't like it because I couldn't turn off the sound!  Couldn't find an option for this.  Deleted it right away.

The adjustable dpi, weights so you can adjust how heavy it is, the software is a little ehhh...and the one issue i have currently and i sent a message to support about is that the scroll wheel doesnt scroll...when i click scroll wheel and move mouse it scrolls the page but just turning it does nothing...reason this is a gripe for me is that alot of the games i play use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out...so for me yes this is an issue, but hopefully support will contact me and have a resolution for this....other than that awsome mouse, greta price...and im also surprised at how customer satisfaction team reached out to ask my opinion, not alot of companies do that any more.<br /><br />Edit-4/17/2013- Shortly after writing this review i was contacted by email by anker and they are sending me a replacement mouse and even sent me return address label...very pleased with there customer service, like i isaid before not many companies actually care about their customers any more..this one does :-)
0385535147|4.0|The Racketeer is yet another outstanding book from John Grisham. It may not be among his best, but it is still a great book. Malcolm Bannister is a lawyer who finds himself in jail for crimes he didn't commit, caught up in a wide net around a big corruption sting. Five years into his incarceration, a federal judge is brutally murdered, and Malcolm knows who did it and why. This catches him up in an uneasy relationship with the feds, even as he wins his release. But there's more here than meets the eye, and readers are left to slowly unravel the layers of reality as the pages turn.<br /><br />Grisham does a great job of keeping the reader a bit off balance, and Malcolm makes for a great main character. Through Malcolm, Grisham explores the federal incarceration system and the experiences of prisoners, unveiling a wasteful and often arbitrary system crying out for reform. Grisham also plants the seeds of a healthy skepticism (maybe bordering on distrust) of federal agencies and the government as a whole, something essential to a healthy and accountable government. This is another thoughtful and enjoyable read from Grisham. I'd give it 4.5 stars if I could.
B008U7ZPHS|5.0|It all started with bedtime stories for my 7 year old- and a way to introduce him to a little mythology and history... It's become my favourite book series and set of characters ever... Funny, spot on mythology, fantastic characterisation, and the perfect way to learn and explore history...
B0061S073A|4.0|I love that it disables in-app purchases, and is easy to set up. The menu makes the app icons look blurry sometimes, and I wish the icons were bigger, but it does exactly what I need, so I am happy!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|This game might be good for tweens, but it isn't one that I would recommend to anyone over 20. I'm sorry to have it on my Kindle.
B008AX1HD8|5.0|I really enjoyed this. There is a good plot, the aboriginal bits were interesting and the opportunity to read the first Harry in english much appreciated. There are some reviewers here who do not agree. As a first book in a series perhaps the characters are a bit light. But the story is original and it stacks up well against your average thriller. I always feel bad reviewing something  by reference to the authors other work. A book should be able to stand alone. Its inevitable you will do this for books forming part of a series. Judged this way then its not a 5 star entry. However if you compare it to other thrillers out there then it is. Read it if you enjoy scandanavian thrillers. Dont expect it to be the best Nesbo. Do expect it to be a good read. Especially on the beach.
B002AKPECW|4.0|I've read Alastair Reynolds' \\"Galactic North\\" and now \\"House of Suns\\" is my second novel by him. It really was a fascinating world he depicts, both realistic and many steps removed from our own. I would definately recommend this to fans of hard and epic science fiction.
B000UUF69A|5.0|One thing I really like about anime done right is that it works on many levels.  Both adults and kids will enjoy this movie.  Personally, I really like it when a story really commits to the world it lives in.  In this version of TMNT we get a more serious side of the story focusing on a post-hayday team that's on the rocks with each other from the start.  If you ever wondered what happened to the turtles after the movies and TV shows in the 90', this movie won't disappoint.
B0091REZMW|3.0|this is a fairly good game id suggest it to others if you're into mysteries as well as search and find ordeals.
0385535139|4.0|If you happen to be an avid reader, and if you've read Grisham avidly, you are probably well aware how hit and miss he can truly get! Sometimes the New York Times hits it right on the head when they call him a #1 Bestselling author. Other times, you can't disagree more, and you're even reluctant to let anybody else borrow certain titles, just to spare them the poo-poo scoop that Grisham can dish out. My personal favorites are \\"The Runaway Jury,\\" \\"The Testament,\\" \\"The Street Lawyer,\\" and \\"The Firm.\\" I suppose such a selection just goes to show that not everybody's going to love the same Grisham title with such vigor, but he isn't exactly the most hated bestseller out there either. He's good! And \\"The Litigators\\" proves that he isn't always so easy to bust chops on. Grisham obviously thought this one through, and I appreciate this effort!<br /><br />If you walk into the law firm of Finley & Figg, you might just run into Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau, eh, you know, about 20 years before the beloved \\"Grumpy\\" movies hit the scene. These 2 go at it just the same as Max and John, although you really don't see them resorting to saying, \\"Putz and moron,\\" with every other word to each other. But hey, they go at it, and they have a secretary, and she more than likely resembles an over-aged Queen Latifah, but she fits in just the same. Walter Figg isn't beyond rushing to the nearest emergency room on an ambulance chase, just to sign up a client. Now, on the other hand, Oscar Finley probably thinks of Figg as a moron most of the time, but we never see that said within the pages! But these guys want to make it big. Will it ever happen? Oscar has his issues outside of the firm, and Walter has his demons that threaten to come out swinging when the pressure is on. But that's Finley & Figg!<br /><br />But then one day, out of the blue, a young man finds his way bumbling into the law offices of Finlee & Figg, and he's drunk as a skunk. His name is David Zinc, and he just said \\"Screw you,\\" to a law firm that is quite successful, but he was dead sick of them. And to celebrate, he decided to drink all day. On top of that? He wants to join these crazy coots, and possibly make a difference himself.<br /><br />With a case that may actually get these guys some recognition, good or bad, the game is on, and it's time to play with the big boys. Somebody might even get to do some cross-examining this time. And oh, by the way, for a story with in this story, there are some Nasty Teeth included. And they just might make this story all the more interesting!<br /><br />Grisham makes this interesting, for the most part. You just have some of those moments where you wonder if you'll constantly be dragging your feet. The answer is no. Grisham put together a winner this time! And that's why he's always worth going back to, good or bad. Because, like a good reader, I can always compare, and come back to when I read \\"The Litigators,\\" a story that features some grumpy old men, a young man named Dave, and a story worth reading!!you,\\" to a law firm that is quite successful, but he was dead sick of them.

The fade in feature is really cool and the high \\"beep\\" that starts at a whisper amazingly wakes you up better than most alarms that sound like a fog horn.

You're Awake....thanks for it...

B000YJ54DU|1.0|Lee Child apparently had a bad experience with a Christian once and now Jack Reacher fans are paying for it, it's a typical ignorant view of American Christians brought to you by an anti-Christian writer. It he views first appeared on his disparaging remarks about airlines providing Bible verses with their meals. Now he goes nuts with a nutty end times preacher. We then find Jack agreeing with an anti-war movement and deserters?<br /><br />Watch out the next Reacher book will have Jack uncovering the conspiracy that the Twin Towers were built by the military for the purpose of creating a terrorist event. I'm now officially an anti-Lee Child fan and wish someone else had the rights to develop Jack Reacher. It was an interesting series at one time, but now it's just another branch of wacko, leftist anti-Christian, progressive rhetoric.<br /><br />The title should be re-named the &#34;Death of Jack Reacher,&#34;
B00000JQ0E|3.0|While these LP's sound much better than the CD due to improved mastering the vinyl itself is much noisier than it ought to be for records this price.  Played soft they sound great but up loud (like they ought to be) sides 2 and 3 have a constant \\"whosh\\" noise through most of the side.  I didn't bother to send them back because I didn't think the replacements would be any better.  Definitely not what they should be though.<br />The overall sound IS far better than the CD release, which is one of the worst mastering jobs ever on one of their best albums

B006CHML4I|4.0|Ok! This is my third Seiko watch, and first Seiko automatic watch. For the price, this is a very solid automatic watch (loses about 10 seconds max a day according to my observance).<br /><br />I have no complaints on how the watch functions, or looks, BUT it has one tiny, or major FLAW depending on how you look at it! The band, has a leather strip down the side of the strap where the holes are for the clasps. It is blue, and looks good! Unfortunately, if you get this wet, say... washing your hands, the color bleeds!! I was in the office and had blue/black marks all over my pants because I sat down and had my wrist on my leg! It all comes off fine, but it has bee over my shirts and pants for a good 2 days before I found out what it was. It's really easy to not realize and just get blue on everything. So if you are careful, you're fine! But if you aren't it can get marks all over everything! Either way, I still love this watch!

B004SJ3AXI|5.0|Always a great game and never any problems . My whole family loves the angry bird series. You won't regret getting this addictive fun and good quality
B004SB60OC|3.0|i love christina perri, and especially jar of hearts, but was dissapointed with the other songs on this cd. i wish i could have bought the single song.
B009X01C64|5.0|I bought this for my hd 8.9. I bought the kindle fire 8.9 HDX. I am not happy with any other cases very disappointed that I can't get it now for my hdx 8.9. any one have a cove like this one?
B008XNZMOU|5.0|my daughter listens to this so much, she knows almost every song, and is five years old. love this cd
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I'm very happy with this purchase.  I've loved ST: TOS  since it first aired on television.  Now I have the complete set!  In cool packaging too.  WooHoo!!!  It is a little difficult to get the DVDs out of the holder inside the plastic box, but worth it for the collectability factor.<br /><br />Now, all I need is a really long weekend to indulge in a marathon of vintage Trek.  I love the costumes, the story lines and all of the creative future tech as seen though their eyes at the time.  Some of which has become a daily reality.<br /><br />Phasers will be set on stun to anyone that bothers me during my marathon....
B007KOYEOC|5.0|Get past the Dom/Sub 'thing' and you will LOVE these books. The love story is just mind blowing. I loved every word and nearly cried when I finished it!!!
B0070Y46UY|5.0|I love this book so much. I can't stop reading it over and over. Simply fascinating and heartbreaking. I love it.
B00BHMF578|2.0|This would have been a good TV mini series. But a blockbuster movie? Not in my opinion! Wait until it airs for free on TV!
B002VPE1WK|5.0|I shopped around and finally settled on this and oh man am I glad I did. This thing is great--plenty of room for all my lenses and accessories, sturdy, and inexpensive but doesn't feel cheap at all. You can't go wrong with it. It holds everything you need it to and more and costs half--or less--what LowePro, Nikon, Canon, or anyone else charges for a much smaller bag. Made me look at AmazonBasics brand for other stuff, too.<br /><br />Update: someone mentioned the sturdiness, i.e., the handle breaking with mild to normal use. I just took this thing, fully loaded, cross country on a train (50 hours one way), lugged it around God's creation at my destination, then took it back across the country on a train. Pulled it by the top handle, straps--you name it--with about 35-40 pounds of gear and stuff in it, and attached it by the back straps and side tripod straps to a rolling piece of luggage and dragged it through two train stations (even had someone trip over the luggage and knock it out of my hand and about five feet across the concourse at one point) to make connections and it handled all that lugging around, manhandling, and abuse like a champ. It doesn't even show any fraying anywhere, the zippers aren't pulling or giving any difficulty, and all straps and handles are still attached, show no signs of fraying or breakage, and support the fully-loaded pack with my camera, lenses, flashes, and other gear in it perfectly just as they did when I took it out of the box. I can only presume the other reviewer got a singular bad pack, which does sometimes happen.
B00192IV9U|5.0|love it .ship fast. great price as well. exactly what i want and i am looking for it for a while.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|A great read! I will read them all again! I have never read a love story that was so strong!
B000063DIR|5.0|Wow Ozzy!  This is such a good musical collectable for those that love a heavier sound.  Some songs were not played on the radio much so you need this one.
B007W8S2MG|5.0|This was the first game in the Persona/Shin Megami Tensei series that I've experienced, and I am so glad that I picked it up.<br /><br />Pros:<br />The characters are all extremely likable, and have English voice actors for pretty much all of their dialogue. I was surprised by the quality of the voice acting and it actually added to the experience. This isn't limited to the main characters either. Even sub-characters who you meet and interact with via social links are voiced, and they're of equal quality to the main group of characters.<br /><br />The storyline is engaging, and while it does take a little time to ramp up at the outset, it is interesting enough that it captures and holds your attention the whole way through.<br /><br />The persona fusion system is extremely deep, with 150+ individual personas to create and find. You'll have to play through the game more than once to obtain them all (I'm actually on my second play through already).<br /><br />Cons:<br />The cons are few and far between, but I noticed that the actual dungeons are rather boring. Most of them are just pallet swaps.<br /><br />And my other gripe kind of depends on how you play the game. There was a point in the middle of the school year where there were no new story developments for about a month because I had cleared the dungeon so quickly. This didn't bother me much since I had other things to do anyway, but I did notice it.<br /><br />If you're looking for a reason to blow the dust off your Vita, this is the number 1 reason to do so. I highly recommend this game for any fan of RPGs.
B004IQMXD4|5.0|Yes!  This is a great CD.  Stevie Nicks has another HIT on her hands here.  Great music by a fantastic artist.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|I was finally able to delete downloaded files and bunch of extra junk that I had on the Kindle.  I am very happy and I now have some free data space.
B0050CJNJ2|5.0|Lady Antiebellum has another hit CD.  There are some really great songs on this one.  I think it is a fantastic CD and would suggest it to anyone that loves good country or cross over music.
B002L3ARRU|4.0|Fun fun fun and an 80s must! It's no earth-shattering movie, but is a must see for children of the 80s, teens and pre-teens, and Matthew Broderick fans.
B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|An up and coming band that has some great music all in one fantastic CD.  I would say if you like country music this is a very good addition to any country music collection.
B0095P3ULC|4.0|I enjoy watching the transformers change back and forth. The graphics were just great so much detail to each transformer.
B000N3ST7A|5.0|Stevie Nicks is such a intriguing individual.  And this musical variety is so her style.  Love it and love to hear the voice of yesteryear still bringing depth to the songs.
B001KDQ4KQ|3.0|Good storyline, interesting characterization,  I am not a big fan of then and now and like this novel it required some back referencing,
B000063DGC|5.0|My son loves this CD.  It is one he listens too often so I would recommend it for those folks that love Ozzy's music.
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|I liked this game, it has clear graphics. I would have liked more rooms and more hidden doors open and such.
B00BI745AA|1.0|This movie was an absolute disgrace to any of the other versions. It was so bad that I actually asked for a refund when I walked out after watching maybe 20 minutes of it. Other than Anne Hathaway...it is the worst attempt at a movie/musical that I have watched. Under no circumstances would I recommend this to any person on the planet.
B009AMANBA|4.0|Have to pay attention to get all of the information supplied, but definitely worth watching.  Looked forward to it coming out in DVD.
B00BDAP66E|5.0|I have been using this for a few days, and it is doing very well. I haven't had any problems with it.
B008YWY0HK|4.0|Great animation and the story is really good.  Brings back all of the memories of growing teenage girls and the influence adults have on their lives and the power of free will.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|I have my Kindle Fire HD, My cell phone, and my husband's cell phone all linked up and keep our schedules for work, and for appointments.  Since using this app on all of our things, we keep everything right an in order, it is wonderful! No more searching for each other scehedules and wondering if the Cats appointment was on the 2nd or 3rd.
B007REV4YI|5.0|Something goes wrong with Bond's assignment and it appears that he gets severely wounded and physically damaged or killed, whatever is worse. Secret agents around the world are being exposed, the location of MI6 is discovered, and \\"M\\" has to relocate the agency, but the worst happens when Javier Bardem hits on Bond... it's love at first sight.
B005HSL626|3.0|This is fun for a little while.  But I am not the main user, my husband uses mostly, with our cats.
0743454537|4.0|this book was not predictable at all.....  Very good read....  great twist at the ending.  Kept my interest throut the book
B00957T6X6|5.0|Since buying this for my kindle at the end of December, I have been able to read so much more, still on the first book, but it is such a wonderful series, I take my time reading.  I had hoped I would have the first book down by now, but I am a slow reader!
B0007MWZEK|1.0|This works alright, not the best. Its good for a quick pick up of dirt but does not do a througho job like a real vacuum does.
B005EGXNLS|5.0|Great story telling with significant historical facts backing it up.  Well done, Mr. Cornwell, well done in deed, sir.<br />I can't wait for another one.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|the slipcover and the case are excellent and elegant for a magnificent movie, making it a worth product to have for my own collection. About the movie itself, I think everything was wrote it already.
B0086700CM|2.0|It is too dark,too boring,it only has three obstacles...<br />But it is fun if you don't have temple run 2.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I LOVE THIS GAME, IT'S  Lots of fun and addicting, I usually play daily. Highly recommend this game, so start playing today as nd so what the hap is about
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is a really good and addictive game. I love it.I would recommend this game to all my friends.I think it is extremely fun and very easy.
B001N4RORE|5.0|We love musicals so this was a good addition to our library. . . . . . . . .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It doesn't matter if you can't buy coins because you can earn them easily and have fun doing it. I totally recommend this game to anyone who's doesn't want to waste time for stupid games.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I missed the first 2 seasons on FX but now I'm all caught up and hooked. Great show!!! ,! ,
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is fun game to play with your friends and family. You could compete or just have a good time.
B009ICQ6KO|5.0|I thoroughly enjoy all of Ben Harper's music, and this CD is no exception. I enjoyed the DVD that came with it, but I'll probably only watch it once.  So I would've been satisfied with just the CD.  Two great artists working together to create some original, one-of-a-kind music.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Okay ?<br />Okay.<br />This is an absolutely brilliant book by an awesome author, the one and only John Green. It's soo good. Just but it okay ?<br />WARNING: If you do not like crying for hours on end for the intense regards you have for fictional characters; I do not suggest this book to you.
B00296A4F4|5.0|I love the first season of this show.  The songs are excellent, I love the<br />mash-ups!  Not real fond of the wife/false pregnancy theme,  seemed a little<br />too stupid for this show.  The actors are excellent, but they would not be in<br />a  &#34;real&#34; high school, this is a fantasy show.  I've only seen a few episodes of the 2nd<br /> season, but that looked excellent also.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I absolutely love this app!! It is fun, and probably the most realistic horse app. Although most horses are bought with gems, some cost playing coins. Very fun!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome and very fun plus it is a great time waster when you have nothing to do and it is challengeing.
B008PNBU30|3.0|It was not what I expected. Most of the songs on this album are not really what I am used to hearing out of TDG. There are only a few songs I can listen to all the way to the end.
B009HQ9UHC|3.0|I got the bad pigs after I had angry birds .I found that some of the  carts and  design  not to my liking.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I bought this CD after having seen these guys in concert a week before. I havent been able to listen to anything else since then. This album is absolutely amazing!!! BUY IT!!
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I loved that you have four games to choose from and  that they start out easy and then slowly got harder as you go.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is very fun and mostly for memory of the course that you run and it keeps you busy . So I just love this game and it upgrades you to different places .
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I like subway surfer it's a fun game to play when you have nothing to do. The time I usually play it is when I have time when I'm on the bus going to school or play it at school.I rally enjoy playing it I'm addicted to the game I had spring break for a whole week and I played it until I was tired. Play it have fun and really enjoy it
B004ZNA5JO|5.0|Gilmour is awesome.  His influence on this LP is quite evident.  A good album even without Waters on it.  It seems Floyds division only helped the artists figure out who they were and where their styles were headed.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game that's all I play now get this game it's awesome and add me on ps3 SpAzZ_TrIckSta hi I have to type 20 words
B004ZNA7WY|3.0|Not a bad album.  I wanted to hear some of Floyds earlier stuff.  This just isn't my cup of tea.  I got a little bored listening to it.  It doesn't seem to have what I personally am looking for.  For others it might be great, but I am a rocker and this was a little too mellow for me.
B00AYATBP6|5.0|I would recommend any of Steven's work.....a true artist with music as his brush. I have seen him twice once solo and the other with Porcupine Tree. As a matter of fact going this May to see Steven Wilson in SF on the Raven That Refused To Sing tour..
B004ZN9YNC|5.0|Raw emotion runs throughout this album and is bolstered by soulful guitar leads and mournful sax solos.  If you were wondering what The Wall was about this album helps explain it.  I think I know every word to every song.  Roger Waters influence on this LP was overwhelming and may likely have been the final straw in the breakup of Pink Floyd.
B007DJUO8O|5.0|Love this music by Steven and Michael.....I would say they are in their own league when it comes to creative minds and music.
B0036TGSIK|4.0|This movie pays major homage to the 80s Brat Pack movies- Breakfast Club, Sixteen Candles, Ferris Bueller, etc. I fell in love with the characters, and all their witty remarks. Its a modern day classic sure to live on for many generations to come. Would buy this movie again for a friend or family member.
B004MYF4SS|5.0|This mystery takes place in northern Scotland on the Isle of Lewis. The Gaelic culture was cleverly woven throughout this book. Our hero returned to the Isle where he was brought up after 20 years. This was very well written. I am looking forward to the next volume in this trilogy.
B0014H32MG|4.0|Cool book. Lots of crazy violence and action. A bit heavy-handed in its anti-media message, but still good. Also darkly funny. 69 stars.
B004L0NGEC|5.0|I open my albums once using this ap,  then have my pictures on my kindle to show people even when offline.  Like a gramma 's brag book only electronic and with hundreds of pics.  If you have both a Kindle Fire and a Picasa account this ap is a must have ap.
B001A7X0WM|5.0|Fun to watch movie and speedy service.  I'm happy to find product available and so quickly and so easily and so inexpensive.
B0053O89KG|4.0|because Captain Roy Montgomery had been eliminated.and I did not like the dark turn season 4 was taking.  I had to wait until I saw how the characters were developing and decide to continue buying the series.  Now that several seasons have shown that the humor has returned I can continue watching the series.
B00BDZV7WQ|5.0|First thang first this CD is fire ya heard me,it reminds me of my favorite lil wayne CD The Block is Hot,the beats are fire so are the lyrics too,and if you got bookoo bass in the trunk like me ur gonna love this CD even more these are my favorites,Gunwalk feat Gudda Gudda & Trippy feat Juicy j the bass on these two songs are bananas over all its worth checking out make sure u get the deluxe version
B0018LMZOE|4.0|This is another great reissue of a classic Moody Blues album. Like the others in the series, it contains very detailed liner notes on both the history of the band and of the recording sessions that resulted in this release. This CD reissue contains all of the tracks from the original vinyl release, plus two bonus tracks. One of those bonus tracks is an alternate version of The Story In Your Eyes, which is quite different from the version that was released as a single. All in all, of you are a fan of the Moody Blues then you will want this CD in your collection.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|101 is the best game ever. It's cool and amazing.I love the car game. I love the shushi game most. L.OV.E THIS GAME;)
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Such an  amazing author.  This last book in the series was everything I expected it to be.  The characters are strong and well defined and there is an interesting story line.  I did not want it to end!  I waited a long time to read knowing it would be the end of the story.  I am sorry that there will not be further adventures with these characters.
0811868419|4.0|I LOVE THIS BOOK and bought it as a gift but when i received it it was not in the condition that it said it was by description
0062238868|5.0|The author does a great job of relating his journey from a young kid in Texas to becoming a highly regarded member of an already highly regarded team. Mr. Kyle does a great job of telling us about not only the training of Seals and the general methods by which they were deployed in Iraq; but gives a window into their community... how Seals interact. You hear from , Taya, Mrs. Kyle, so you get some perspective on Seal life at home.  Lastly, the author brings home the realities of combat, confusion, sound, the interaction between services (Army, Navy, Marines, Airforce), death, administration.  Read this book.
B00BGIBVP8|1.0|Tgis movie should not have been advertised as a comedy. It's more depressing than funny. Also, there was a funny scene in the preview that I was looking forward to seeing, and it wasn't even in the movie!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is awesome i love playing it and i love the world tour its so fun and really addicting so get this  game really theres nothing bad about it
B001F12J0C|5.0|This is such a great trilogy!!!  Every movie is so great, intense, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. A great buy!!
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I thought that it would be boring but it is very addicting!I love this app!I would recemend this game to all of you reading this!I hope that you enjoy the game!
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|A Bad Day To Go To The Movies.<br /><br />This travesty is a slur on the Die Hard franchise that is so far from the brilliance of the classic original, it's hard to even think of it as a a Die Hard movie. Plot? Nonsensical and pathetic, more like a rejected idea for Bond or Mission:Impossible movie. Direction? Baaad. A lazy, crappy Tony Scott impersonator. And the cast? Who cares! Bruce certainly doesn't. He's nothing like the McClane we've come to know and love, he's just a belligerent knucklehead who really is in the wrong place at the wrong time (ie this movie). Bruce is almost bizarrely immobile compared to other installments, getting older or maybe he just didn't give a damn. Jai Courtney as his son is like Sam Worthington's younger, surlier brother. He and Willis have zero chemistry, not helped by the sub moronic screenplay.<br /><br />For sheer eye popping destruction with minimal CGI, there's a car chase early on but even that's poorly handled by a director, that for some reason, chose not to shoot this movie in widescreen.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Love love love this show! Excellent acting, excellent writing. The twists in the stories keep me surprised every episode. So happy that I discovered this show even if I was a bit late to the party.
B007N5YJYS|5.0|I will never tier of this movie classic. Alfred never disappoints!! If you are one who likes the twists and turns of his movies you must start here.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|Another Dr. Suez classical with lots of silliness, bright colors, engaging characters and fun music.  You just can't go wrong with Dr. Suez classics
1428155937|5.0|This book will give you pause to think of the possiblities of an event like this could happen. Read the book then listen to it.
B00AMBK0X4|3.0|&#34;Ted&#34; had some laugh-out-loud moments but the humor was somewhat raunchy.  My kids loved this movie so maybe I'm just getting old.
B0043RGY60|5.0|Love 30 Seconds to Mars and this Deluxe Edition!!! Excellent product!! I would highly recommend this to everyone!! Exceeded expectations!
B001DPHDCY|5.0|You can't go wrong with Dr. Suez who makes silly even sillier!  This is a fun, bright and colorful adventure in total silliness!
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I loved the books, but I also really love the visually appealing movies. I love that you become part of the story because of the vivid imagry and well laid plot!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I have alwaysl ike temple run. but bated the other temple run love love love temple run love love me
B003L77FYS|5.0|With Castle, I am continually surprised by what they pull out of their creative hats! Absolutely an amazing show to watch!
B000W25JUW|5.0|Rock music simply never, ever recovered. And NOBODY rocked blue denim like the boys on the cover of this album. And people think Clapton was God... they have no clue.
B004529NKC|5.0|Being a dance fanatic, I loved this. What made it even better for me was Twitch from &#34;So You Think You Can Dance&#34; in it!
071815780X|4.0|I bought this for my girlfriend, but I've been using it as well. I'm traditionally no good with cooking, but Jamie's books (not only this one) have been of much help.<br /><br />In this book, Jamie gives not only useful recipes, but full courses; the way the recipes are written enable to cook everything at once with ease. As with all cooking books, though, getting the precise ingredients can be a bit of a challenge sometimes.  I'd appreciate a slightly bigger font size, too.
B0053O89KG|5.0|I am obsessed with Castle! The witty duo that keep the fun coming while solving murders too. I love it!
B009LMTDL0|5.0|Very well written and the material is very relative.  Sheryl really shares her personal experiences both good and bad in her career and family and how they intertwine together.  The book encourages women to be their true persona at work for all of us to enjoy a better work experience. My friends and I are what we consider &#34;power-working mommies&#34; and this book is a great guide for us as well and validates a lot of our feelings and experiences while challenging things we should be working on.  Great book! Buy it and read it!
B000J3OTSM|5.0|I'm an avid dancer, and love dance movies. I loved the story and the romance, but loved the dancing even more! Channing Tatum is so HOT in this movie!!!
B0038BBA4I|1.0|Doubtless this act was deliberately cooked up for the significant U.S. population of faux-folk-lovin' middle-aged Anglo- &  Celto-philes. At its best, it's wussified Pogues.<br /><br />And I bet you a pint of warm lager drink that the band members wear vests.
B001F12J0C|4.0|Jam packed with nonstop action and thrills. Matt Damon gives an incredible performance in each movie and has you hanging on the edge of your seat.
B004HWT6DO|5.0|Great movie. It inspires you to think of the next big idea while also making you feel you have accomplished very little in your life.
B003F3NDWG|5.0|The writers of Castle continue the hi-jinks and detective work. I can truthfully say this is My favorite TV series!
B0001Z52RU|4.0|It was alright. I had to watch it twice to understand what confused me the first time. Good story. Disc was in good shape and packaged well.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|I am in love with this! It has a brilliant mix of whit, suspense, romantic tension, and mystery... My favorite case solving show!
1595825045|5.0|This book is very detailed in which it talks about before they made avatar, to the idea, the production, the pilot, the series, and its end. It covers every little corner in which a viewer would want to know. It also has drawing of the main character from their pilot form to when their drawing them on the story board. I would recomend it to any fan of the series.
B0012QCZ54|4.0|A fun movie with sass, amazing dance choreography, and a story that sucks you in! I love a good dance movie, but love one that makes you think even more!
0071771263|5.0|This book have some real test practices and it helped me to improve my test scores.<br />I really liked the speaking section.
B005LAII3U|1.0|Wished I had not bought it.<br /><br />It was a non-stop action sequence.  Very lame.  Did not leive up to it's name sake.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|great game love it. I usually do it when Im bored and have nothing better to do. good occupier. You should get it.
B0069G5Z9K|4.0|It is really intense towards the end of the game. So many things happening at once. Makes it even better. The story line is werid, but i guess that really doesnt matter. You can get a lot of gadets whilw you play this game as well. My favortie part by far. ^_^
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Buy this app it is amazing you can get many players and different boards...different levels and everything.... they always have updates and new characters
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|Three words Awesome. Game. Ever!! It really is. Love having the fact that you must eat and eat. O ly thing is your health/hunger gets low too quickly. Other than that its really fun. (:
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|movie was effing awesome, i watched it about 3 times, once for myself, and 2 other times because ppl who walked by in my house ended up getting sucked into the well done drama. It also helps that Erica Bana is in it lol
B005H9B44A|5.0|I love this movie.  I have watched it at least 8x since it's been in out.  Boo to all critics who dislike this movie.
B004E547D8|5.0|Helen and Bruce team up to make this an action pack movie.  Really enjoy one of these  types of movie every once in awhile.
B001ECQ4DA|2.0|I was very dissapointed to see that the image quality is not good, not even is it HD. And to have castillian spanish instead of latin spanish, sort of makes this a bad acquisition.
0061122416|5.0|This book is fantastic. The story begins with a love for the main character and later builds into an amazing story which makes it hard to put down.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I always did love to play solitaire and now on Amazon it's even better.  I'm not to good at it but it's fun any way.  Betty
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn put together a great page turner. My first of her novels.  I'm hooked got Dark Places next and it was even better than Gone Girl.  If you like a good mystery with twists and turns and characters that you want to believe in till the end - you will not be disappointed.  I just loaded her other novel to my kindle app after I was up till 3am finishing Dark Places.  Im hooked!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|You definitely need to read this last book to find the &#34;good News&#34; in the Hunger Games trilogy...it is mostly bad news before that
B00B99KJR0|5.0|For the bejeweled fans out there this presents a fun alternative with a silly story. Excellent graphics and smooth game play grants hours of gaming.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|The Weather Channel is very helpful in alerting us of the local weather conditions and in my planning our outdoor activities.
B002SR2PKG|5.0|Love this book, its one of my favorite Stephen King books of all time. I would give more then five stars if i could.
B00B5A9FLY|5.0|I have loved every season of Merlin & this one is no exception, you've got Arthur whose been King for 3 peaceful years with Guinevere along side him, Merlin who is always looking out for Arthur & Morgana who is her usual vengeful self. The arrival of Mordred as a grown man played by Alexander Vlahos has added even more depth to the series. This final season has had the usual mixture of drama & laughter but also a tinge of sadness that this to be the end of Merlin. I will miss him & all his adventures.<br /><br />I wish they had had the big reveal early in the series or even at the end of the last one. I'm sure the plots could have been even more enthralling than they were with Merlin using his magic & Arthur knowing about it, & the pair of them trying to defeat Morgana once & for all. Having said that, this season has lived up to the usual high standards of the BBC.  Well done BBC.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is the best Bible ap that I have found yet! It's easy to use and the best part is that I can even listen to the Word while I'm driving which is what I do most of the time. I would highly recommend it to anyone!
B0061S0A64|5.0|Nodebeat is quite uniqye in the music app world. As an ambient composer for nearly 20 years now, i have a fair amount of experience in the electronic music genre - and Nodebeat makes me want to create and to play! Its better for ambient than even Eno's app is....i love it!
142313866X|5.0|Inspire, inspire, inspire, page after page is nothing but great stuff and that`s what it`s all about.<br />This book gets an &#34;A &#34; :-)
B007URVZJ6|4.0|An excellent resource guide for those who haven't yet placed their book on kindle.  I would highly recommend this book for the novice who wants to publish  but don't know how to go about it. Loaded with valuable step by step information.
B000SJJCX4|5.0|Works great for me, no issues. Easy to use, the battery can be a pain to change out, but thats true for all pedals. I use the power adapter and have a battery inside in case I cant get power.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I cant stand bejeweled but i love this game. It is very fluid to swap peices. There is strategy involved and plenty of levels and challenges. I like the power ups. I dont like when it suggests moves though and clears pieces automatically after they drop down
B000QXDED6|4.0|This version was taken from the comic series but captures the valor of the Spartans.  Xeres and his massive army are formidable which make the bravery and skill of the Sparatans even more memorable.
B007REV4YI|4.0|I think Daniel Craig makes a great James Bond.The version of these movies seem more believable .I thought this movie was great.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|So I loved the singing, it was so amazing I literally wanted to get up my seat and dance and sing along with them. I wish they would have added more songs to this movie, because I'm thirsty for more of their amazing music. This movie was very fun, and I literally wanted to scream when they weren't singing. I thought this movie was a lot better then Glee, the characters where very likable. I loved Fat Amy and Gale, their personalities were the only things that could make me go on when there wasn't any singing. Now the comedy, the only really funny person was Fat Amy, but I really only found myself giggling throughout this movie, but the singing makes up for that. This will be one of my favorite movies. Elzabeth Banks, Anna, and Rebel Wilson were all great and amazing in this movie, this is defenitly a must see movie for all musical fans.<br /><br />The Barden Bellas are a collegiate, all-girls a cappella singing group thriving on female pop songs and their perfect looks. After a disastrous failing at last year's finals, they are forced to regroup. Among the new recruits is freshman Beca, an independent, aspiring DJ with no interest in the college life. But after she meets Jesse, from the rival all-male a cappella group, Beca has a new outlook and takes it upon herself to help the Bellas find their new look and sound and get back into the competition.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|My son loves this game.  It tends to run my battery down a little faster than the other games. But I guess all games are different.
B0052RDHTM|5.0|It was great to read Follet again. I can't wait to read his next book, which I have purchased already
B007FTZDN8|5.0|Clean, easy to use, easy to navigate, and I love the bookmark feature. We have this installed on four devices in our home, from a very early smartphone to the kindle HD. It works well with no hiccups on all of them.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Tttttttt5tttttttt type t t t t t t think I was a good thing about this page not a try and his name of drugs to wreck your own project management and his name was a jew to think about your programmer does not have angry sex and alcohol consumption of drugs to wreck your programmer does not have angry sex with men
B006SMLAMQ|3.0|It's okay. But does not distinguish it's self from the rest of the similar apps. Chews up a lot of memory.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|It's . Cool but sometimes . It has . To refresh very often but it oily s B-) petty addicting.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the Wool Omnibus Edition because the description looked interesting and hey, it was cheap!!<br />The price ended up being the least of this book's benefits - the Wool books grab your interest from the first page and keep you wanting to find out what happens next, even after you finish the last page.<br />The Omnibus edition is really the best way to read these books, since some of the books don't really stand as whole books on their own.  Reading the Omnibus, you just flow seamlessly into the next book.<br /><br />After you read these books, make sure you get the prequels:  Shift Omnibus Edition.  They add a whole new dimension of backstory - after I read the Shift books, I went back & re-read Wool to get the whole flow of the story.<br />I can't wait to see what Howey comes up with next!
B004Q7CIFI|5.0|I only started reading Stephen King last year and have very quickly become a great admirer of his work. As with his other stories, a unique blend of imagination and methodical approach yield a suspense-filled story that is completely ... well, difficult to remember is fiction.  Moreover, his fantastic attention to historical detail - both actual and fictionalized - drove me not only to reflect upon the period, but to research it.
B008YCMM2A|5.0|Live in Europe 1969 is suberb! I love the music, and want everybode to experience the unike Mike Davis. Love this music.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|this game is soooooo addicting you will never regret  istalling it . its. like temple run but a whole different reason. the thing that I don't like is that it wont let me update it to he next version.
B001U9BRNE|5.0|This DVD has so many artists on it that it is hard to describe.  From Josh Groban to Blake Shelton, from Bottecelli to Boz Scaggs all the hits are well known.  When I'm down, I put the DVD on and by the time I hear a few songs I'm feeling much better.  Not to be confused with the later versions...this is the one that does it for me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game keeps my little girl entertained for hours. I also play it. I like the missions and daily challenges.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game lots of fun but has WAY too many adds. And it could use more horse breeds.<br />Thanks for reading
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|After reading the book Tom Cruize did a great job at pulling of his character. While not being his best work he did do a good job.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It's an awesome game, but I can't update to the new version. HELP ME .. I highly recommended this game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The app works great.I would totally buy this app if I were you if you haven`t already.If this is your first time playing or actually any time, then I got to tell you this is WAY better than temple run ,one or two. You can play this in the car or at home. Even when your on a bumpy road -you do not need to tilt your devise to collect coins and you won't get eaten.This is a family orientated app that won't give the little sibling nightmares and will let you buy boosts with money you earn in the game. The only downside is the adds,they big you all the time but you get used to it.:) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :) :)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game it's so fun when I am board I play this game :)!!!!!;) it's the coolest game ever. Love it
B000N6U0E2|5.0|First of all, I am a true Will Smith fan.  He and his son did an amazing job with this movie.  Also, it happens to be a true story.  It started off rather sad because the main character couldn't sell his bone scanning machines.  But then because he loved his son so much, he would do anything not only to take care of his son, but also was studying for the job he finally earned.  It was a very inspiring story and it is a true story.
B0013TTLDE|4.0|Just finished! Couldn't put it down. The characters and the suspense increases as the story begin to unravel.<br />Totally recommended.
B000FC13UE|3.0|This is one of Gaiman's collections of short stories. Keeping this in mind going into it, the stories are typically good. Characterization was solid, plots flowed well for the most part, a d the dialogue was good. My only complaint is that many of the stories were more sexual than they needed to be. It felt rare that the sexualization added anything to the story, and indeed often felt superfluous. On the whole the collection is good, but that rather lowered my enjoyment of the stories. Of course, as always with books and stories, your mileage may vary.
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I bought this book based on the description and the reviews.  It made me remember what young desperate love felt like.<br /><br />Eleanor & Park is set in Omaha, in 1986. Eleanor is the new girl, \\"big and awkward, with crazy hair, bright red on top of curly...with half a dozen weird necklaces hanging around her neck and scarves wrapped around her wrists. She reminded Park of a scarecrow...\\".  He is a \\"weird Asian kid. He had green eyes. And skin the color of sunshine through honey\\". They are opposites in every way, and fall in love in spite of themselves.  Eleanor has a secret life from Park and then from her messed up family after Park and Eleanor are in a  relationship.  And Park wants to be apart of everything Eleanor does and is.<br /><br />I really loved the book, I hated when I had to put it down. I wanted more with every page.  It was not a typical sappy love story (which I hate).  It has depth and emotion beyond the characters ages.  I loved every page until I got to the end - and then I stopped loving it.  I am all for ambiguity and open endings, but when I got to the last page and read the final words, I did not see this coming.  I stopped for a moment and flipped the pages forward and backward looking for something I must have missed.  It can't end like this.  It was not enough.  I wanted more.  I would recommend the book for all its great plots and words, it is a wonderful story, but beware the ending.  It may catch you off guard, like it did me.  I am still sad about it :(
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|works just as it says.  Has many different alarms your sure to find 1 that will make you jump outages bed &iexcl;!!!!!!!
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Was really glad to get this movie. Would recommend it to any who liked the first and the Avengers series. Glad to have it on Blu-ray and the DVD and digital will probably come in handy at some point.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Wonderful read. Great pace and very accurate from a science and policy perspective. I work at NASA JSC and I could see many of the exchanges! And a &#34;that's what she said&#34; joke is perfectly used here!
B000BNX4MC|4.0|This movie was a blast from the past. It was fun to see the special features and interviews. Definately for the 80's child.
B00ANYJ3NI|5.0|Much like Lewis' original character analysis of the Masters of the Universe on Wall Street in his acclaimed best-seller Liar's Poker, Michael focuses again on the story behind the big winners in the Sub-Prime meltdown. Once again readers are left scratching their heads about the anointed coporate leaders of the insurance and financial world and wondering, \\"Who the heck is minding the store?\\" Believe me - you'll want to read this book and you won't have to wrap your head around the complex financial securities that made the story reality. Just enjoy learning about the people that found themselves sitting on a gold mine of biblical proportions - and mined it for every last dollar.
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This series, based on Martin's &#34;A Song of Fire and Ice&#34; double trilogy, is unparalleled in just about every category one would look for in a show.  Be it the writing, directing, casting, acting, wardrobe, or set production, you won't be let down.  In fact, not only won't you be let down, but you're in for a visual treat, and one that grips you emotionally.  You'll laugh, cry, and in every way blown away by how well the show is put together.<br /><br />Very basically, the show is about the King's throne, and who will out maneuver whom to get their family, or someone in their family to the top, to be King. You'll watch with rapt attention how the choices each of the 10 or so major characters affect the rest of the world.  Peter Linklage absolutely dominates his role as &#34;the Imp&#34;--the youngest son of the richest family in what they refer to as &#34;the 7 Kingdoms,&#34; and just dares you to root against him as he is the dwarf son of the patriarch of the Lannister family.<br /><br />As amazingly acted as this show is, it's hard to find even a single flaw in the entire show.  If the show has any weaknesses, it would be in trying to pass 20 something year old actors as 14 and 15 year olds, and, if you want to call it a weakness, there are only 10 shows per season and as the show keeps delivering one of the most epic, addictive performances, I've found it hard, personally, not to watch the 20+ episodes which have been made because you'll always be yearning for more.<br /><br />For the parents, I would strongly suggest you watch an episode before allowing anyone under the age of 13 from watching as you might find yourself forced into having &#34;the talk&#34; with them long before you want to. When they warn you about the sex, nudity, and violence, they're not kidding.  There's plenty of each, however none are used gratuitously.  They're used as needed to show the character of each, well, each character.<br /><br />So, pros would be: Acting, Directing, Production, Writing, Costuming/Wardrobe, make-up, special effects.<br />The negatives would be: only 10 shows a season, only available through either pay-cable, or pay-amazon, though quite honestly, it's worth every penny, and, for those who've read the books, the age-inappropriate casting.  Since the very first episode I was highly dubious when I saw 2 characters who, in the books, are only 14 and 15, but both arrive sporting beards any 30 year old would envy, and a girl who's supposed to be 12 looking closer to 20 than 12.  With that being its worst flaw (and quite explicable by saying, quite simply, the show was never meant to be exactly the same as the books.  Those who haven't read the books won't even notice it), again, it's a show without equal.<br /><br />To sum up, it's as I said in the title.  In my opinion, to date, this is the very best show ever made for the small screen.  The scope of the story, and the glorious visuals just beg you to watch the show with a projector so you can watch it on a 120&#34; screen.  The producers spared no expense in making this show everything it could be.  Other than giving us 20 hours of viewing per season instead of 10, I'm not altogether certain there's anything which could've been done better.ction, Writing, Costuming/Wardrobe, make-up, special effects.<br />The negatives would be: only 10 shows a season, only available through either pay-cable, or pay-amazon, though quite honestly, it's worth every penny, and, for those who've read the books, the age-inappropriate casting.

B009FZHYKU|5.0|The Walking Dead continues to produce nonstop action, drama and connection.  Connection with the characters on the screen.  The Walking Dead is amazingly wrote and executed.  The writers give you people to love people to hate, they give you hope and rip away just as quickly.  It is a thrill ride from the first episode throughout the last, and undisputedly one of the single best television shows on currently, and for the most part in a long while.  AMC has crushed the competition with the fan base they are cultivating using this show.  This show has earned itself a generals rank amongst the television world anyone not watching this needs to get with the program, enjoy season three everyone.  Daryl Dixon Rules.
B00BI5IXL4|5.0|I can't say enough good things about this film. Well done, well acted, well sung. If you fail to cry tears of joy, you ain't human...LOL
B000Q6GUW0|5.0|I love movies and television.  I have watched every good show that's been on television for the last 10 years and I have watched numerous that were considered \\"B\\" rated or inferior to.  I have seen the work of true amateurs shine and I have seen the work of legends crumble to the ground.  I have seen unfiltered talent and I have seen levels of mediocracy that should have never hit the screen.  But I have never seen a show like Dexter.  Masterfully wrote and executed, Michael C Hall is stunning in his role as a serial killer that is also the blood splatter analysis for Miami Metro PD.  Watch as the layers of Dexter's past are peeled away and the story of how his darkness was born emerges.
B00992CF6W|5.0|it is so awesome get inveditor and you can get zombie pigman mobs and tons of other items its awesome
B004AUGJS8|2.0|I thought this movie was gonna be wayyyyy different than it actually was. My friend and I wanted a nice rom com, and we thought with Kirsten Dunst and Ryan Gosling plus romance, that's what this would be. BOY were we wrong.<br /><br />It was a good movie, yes, but it FREAKED us out. It is very suspenseful, so don't be fooled because they are married. This movie gets real dark, real quick.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Downton Abby was recommended by a few friends so I thought I would watch a few episodes to check out the fuss. I enjoyed ep1 but fell in love by ep2. The storyline is fantastic, characters are brilliant, the set and costumes are gorgeous and now have a complete understand as to why it won awards. DA is now one of my all time favorites!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Not for the faint of heart. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. During some scenes you have to remember to breath.
B008S4YZCO|2.0|This game while cute was hard for my 6 year old to catch on, he had trouble playing and ended up wanted to delete it
B00AMBK0X4|1.0|Not a funny feel good movie. Mean story line. I'm glad I didn't waste money seeing this in the theater.
B0092ZEIN4|1.0|If you're comparing this controller to another controller on the market, please disregard this controller entirely. It's got compatibility issues beyond the app. My Pantech Burst refused to pair with this device, and the app just made things worse for the controller and the phone. I finally got it working on the computer, and let me tell you this: It's STILL terrible. The analog pads are terribly designed and you'll just blister your thumbs trying to stand Nyko's attempts at \\"traction\\": the plastic raised bumps will make it impossible to hold it. As for the D-pad, it's ALSO terrible. Think an XBOX 360's d-pad, but one that occasionally locks up and will have your character occasionally duck for too long or walk right off a cliff when you meant to stop at it.<br /><br />In general, if you're looking for an Android controller, wait until a quality one comes out. If you're looking for a computer controller, LOOK FOR A COMPUTER CONTROLLER. By Logitech or something. Much better idea than this terrible thing.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I wait each week for this and am glad I can catch the episodes I may have missed using Amazon Prime.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this app. I also like how you can update it!!!! This is addictive. You Will never find a better app.
B00BU8RNCE|5.0|Very intense right from the beginning. What a way to conquer such tragedy of mother nature and come out stronger as a family in the end.
B0095ZMMCK|4.0|I ad not read any Clancy for a while and this was recommended by a friend and I enjoyed the storyline.

B0063IH60K|5.0|We Love this game.  It gets addicting! I play it everyday. If you love soltiare you will absolutely must get this.  You will not be sorry.
B00023GGFI|5.0|I had the original vinyl of this until my house was burglarized a couple years ago; Couldn't wait to hear it again! Thanks.
B00499QUK2|4.0|Good acting and production.  However, periodically the volume was too low.  I'm not sure if the problem was the WiFi connection, the kindle, or the streaming. The volume, however, was the only negative.
B001GZ6QEC|5.0|Its was alright... lots of Hollywood special effects. some of the violence was a bit overdone. showing the sadistic sides of the bad guys. not a movie for small children.. too violent for my gf.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|All of the other five star reviews are a good indication that this Blu Ray is one of the best around in all categories that matter namely Sound,Vision and Performance.If you like the Eagles then all the hits are here faithfully reproduced in concert with impeccable harmonies and all those memorable guitar riffs played note perfect.This is not to say that the concert is without any fun or spontaneity.Joe Walsh lightens things up throughout and Glen Frey adds some witty remarks when introducing some songs.Would be good to have had Don Felder still with them on guitar but Stuert Smith played all the Felder riffs beautifully so most fans wouldn't hear the difference.<br /><br />The bonus material is confined to interviews with the band members which are interesting and they make a point in saying that all this perfection doesn't happen by accident.They work hard and rehearse a lot to get everything just right,especially the vocal harmonies.A recommended purchase and region free.
1480111724|5.0|An engaging and informative history of the law that shows the quirks of our legal system. An enjoyable collection of vignettes that range from humorous stories to the foundations of modern liberty. Worth a read!
B0052U6JLC|3.0|These may be OK if you can get them on your feet, but they are hard to slip on if you are using something like Lock Laces to keep from having to tie/untie shoes.  It is hard to slide your foot forward in them because of the nature of the material of the inner sole.  It seems like a non skid surface. I also got a good blister on the back of my left foot.  That may be because they weren't on tightly enough because of using elastic laces.  They do feel good when they are on though.  I have to do some more testing.  I won't be using them on any more long runs for the foreseeable future though.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|I luv this game except for the fact that sometimes people say rude stuff to each other and it makes me feel bad to have technology. Bullying someone in person is one thing but bullying someone on the Internet is another./
1597801585|4.0|I really liked this book. The author is great at painting a very detailed world. While the story itself was alright, I mostly found myself finishing it quickly because I loved all the details that he included, and I could imagine what was going on, and potentially write some fanfics in this universe :). I recommend it.
B000WCN8SC|5.0|You must buy this for the excellent 5.1 soundtrack alone.But the extra and bonus tracks are very good too.Never before sounded The Doors this good.Highly recommended
B006MW3V6U|5.0|LOVE, LOVE, LOVE this series. I highly recommend it to everyone! If you love period pieces and British history, you won't be disappointed by Downton Abbey
B004GHNIRK|5.0|After seeing the movie, there are new faces to the characters for imaging the story.  Enjoyed the read and you will too.
B004DI7HZ6|4.0|Good book. Kept me interested from the beginning. I can't wait to read the next one. I just wish it cost less.
B003YFIUW8|4.0|I couldn't get used to the &#34;kid speak&#34; in the beginning.  Maybe because I work with kids all day?  But by the second half I was used to it and really enjoyed it.  Interesting premise and an all together good read.
B0034DGPEU|4.0|I found that I was immediately caught up in the characters in this book.  Once I began, I couldn't put this book down.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app will not update and I believe that they should fix the glitch because it will scare a lot of people off but overall good game have fun people the update is the only reason I left out one star
B0002KZAKS|4.0|Nice audio range, excellent balance and weight....it's hard to complain about a nice product!  Packaging is very nice, although I do wish it would have been clearer that the included microphone stand clip was a Euro thread.
B009HEJXFS|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  Excellent story from start to finish.  It was both funny and exciting and worth watching again.
1455502758|4.0|It would have been a privilege to have known the incomparable \\"Hitch.\\" This was his last book, penned between his diagnosis in 2010 of esophageal cancer and his demise on December 15, 2011. His work output remained prodigious throughout those 18 months. He approached his inevitable death by making it a topic for journalistic investigation. He had investigated thousands of topics (except for sports) for Vanity Fair over the years.<br />Friends as well as enemies wondered whether Hitchens would make peace with God before his death. He did not and remained unconvinced to the end, despite the best efforts of well-known evangelicals. He was a worthy adversary.<br />Christopher Hitchens lived heartily and in the moment. He was a heavy drinker and smoker who, according to his widow, never missed deadline. She concludes this book with her reminiscences of his notes, letters, and emails to her and thereby allows us a peek into what must have been an exceptional marriage.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I have now viewed the first 2 seasons and found that I was always eager to see the next episode. For anyone interested in English history and World War I, this series is both entertaining and educational. The characters seemed real. The actors and the story line are superb.
B0058SNKRY|5.0|Most comfortable shoes I have ever worn! Great value for crocs...........wish they would make some for summer! Love Love Love!
B0097EWK3A|4.0|Some of the back and forth between locations was a bit tedious,  but overall enjoyed playing. Looking forward to the sequel.
0375842209|5.0|Let me say, Leisel Meminger is an amazing character that, because of the narration, you find yourself completely loving. You see the full humanity of every character, Hans and Rosa Hubermann, Rudy, and Max. You even see the narrator, Death's full perspective and humanity. It paints a picture of Nazi Germany, its oppression, and how a few people managed to find themselves in a dictatorial society. I found myself attached to the characters, and many tears were shed over this book.
B001UHOWXI|5.0|This movie is absolutely one of the finest movies ever made. Classic James Stewart. This is no finer movie made for Christmas. Thought provoking.
B00AE2I4B6|5.0|The story line is ok, but the dancing is amazing.  Just like the other step ups, the dancing is the best part of the movie.  I'm in awe of these very talented people.  Don't expect any meaningful or enlightening dialogue, but who cares, I'm mesmerized by the movement.  I could watch that type of dancing all day long.  It's so creative.  I recommend it!
B000VBIGD6|5.0|This is another classic Christmas Movie. The comedy is outstanding. If you have had family Christmas gatherings like we have had, you will recognize family members in the cast.
098478280X|5.0|I am using this to prepare for a set of interviews with google along with a bunch of other resources, this one might be the best
6305535264|4.0|This is a great movie, although I am not a big fan of Farrah's acting abilities. My wife thinks the robot is one of the scariest robots in any SciFi movie.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|This game allows you to have fun while using good logical skills.  It is good for young and old.  I recommend it
B000641D2Y|3.0|This movie is cute, but not as good as the first Home Alone. It is well produced and directed. The acting is well done, but the premise is just too silly for me. However, my aging mother and a lot of kids love it.
B00B69UQEO|5.0|I have been a die-hard fan of Depeche Mode my adolescent/adult life (from 1987 onwards). This is an honest review, not that the other reviews aren't honest. STOP COMPARING albums! As any band of this magnitude and time spent together is going to either reinvent their sound or change up the style a bit (but keep their Depeche-ness).<br /><br />There are certain DM albums I like more than others, and as a TRUE fan, you have to take away differences from all albums. Of course my all time fave album is Black Celebration. There will NEVER be another Black Celebration, and that's why it's a classic and has cult status with any DM fan.<br /><br />Delta Machine however is TRUE DM. Dave's heart-felt and deep sexy baritone voice, Classic dark backbeats, Martin's high pitched melodies along with Dave's deep huskiness/sexiness. This album is a real grower. I know many people think that albums should not have to grow on you. However, I completely disagree with that. The reason is because each time I listen to it, I am falling more and more in love with it.<br /><br />From the time Alan Wilder left, I didn't really love Martin's solo songs (except Home). Before Wilder left, Martin's solos were truly beautiful (my personal faves are Sometimes and World Full of Nothing). However, \\"The Child Inside\\", is one of the most poignant and deep songs on this album. As I recently listened, it resonated with me. This speaks of so many of the tragedies in the world (like Newtown and Aurora). It actually almost made me cry.<br /><br />The second half of the album is definitely better than the beginning, but it's all good. If you are a true DM fan, please don't listen to any negative reviews and really give this album a chance. It will be on your constant playlists.
B0019NB9A2|5.0|This movie has everything for a SciFi buff. The ideas of the future back in the 50's and 60's were mind stirring. This is another classic SciFi movie that brings back a lot of memories.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Touching story of strength and love.....a must read for every woman.  Written very well..cannot wait to see the movie now.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|Love, love this CD/MP3.  Bruno Mars is a major talent. His songs range from sorrowful to soulful to vengeful to joyful. It's unusual to like every single song on an album but I absolutely do on Unorthodox Jukebox.  I play this in my car more than any other CD (except possibly Adele). Everyone should listen to Bruno Mars music.
B004I8WD6E|2.0|okay i guess for price but for a Clint Eastwood few dollars more better quality can be found.  Great for kids iPod pass down.
B004PHSTY8|5.0|My best friend talked me into watching this show, and I'm so glad she did. I became an instant fan! This show is very smartly portrayed. It has had an amazing cast and writters over the years. Everyone on the show does such a great job. A must own for anyone looking for a great tv show to watch!
B00AU15HPC|5.0|This CD is for the consummate Justin Hayward fan. Once again, he shows just how gifted he is at writing and playing a variety of genres. It's more of an acoustic sound with some songs having bluegrass overtones. Superb!
B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I love the Brits. They're so funny, and this movie is spot on. Don't confuse it with the American knock-off version with the same name. This movie is much better in every way.
B007SGM084|5.0|I found these books to be extremely interesting, chronicling the sexual maturity of a newly graduated college student through the next several years of her life.  These books point out that there are a myriad of ways people derive sexual pleasure, and Fifty Shades delves deeply into one of them.  I applaud the author for the depth to which she takes her readers into the lives of the characters of these books.  I am waiting to see what she comes up with next.  These books require readers with an open mind, so open yours up and enjoy..........
B00APUYWYA|5.0|I was &#34;forced&#34; to watch this movie. And by &#34;forced&#34; I mean my friend was recovering from surgery and she wanted to watch it and I couldn't say no. I'm glad I did. I love this movie. LOVE! It's great! The singing, and dancing, and who doesn't love Skylar Astin. I mean how adorable is he? I thought everyone did a great job singing...and Rebel Wilson is a scream! Bought it, love it. I even bought the soundtrack.
0739378112|4.0|Henning Mankell got me off on Scandinavian Crime Fiction to the extent that it has dominated my pleasure reading for the last three years.  I have met so many great authors and read so many wonderful books.  Thanks for this.  Mankell has been too successful in the Wallander series and just gave up to escape that success.  In this book he shows what he knows about people and life in general.  Crime in Scandinavia is different that in England and the US and is interesting
B0017YDPI2|5.0|My best friend talked me into watching this show, and I'm so glad she did. I became an instant fan! This show is very smartly portrayed. It has had an amazing cast and writters over the years. Everyone on the show does such a great job. A must own for anyone looking for a great tv show to watch!
0316069434|3.0|Michael Connelly has gotten comfortable being a success.  He is a good writer and has well though out plots.  His books are all about one person Detective Bosch.  We don't really have any deep thoughts or discussions of society or politics.  There is very little passion in these books and one feels as if Connelly is trying to be careful to be mainstream so that he does not lose his faithful readers (buyers)  The ending just fell flat after a pretty good book.  All in all you just can't get mad at Connelly and his books are a good way to pass time.
B001ECQ4AS|5.0|My best friend talked me into watching this show, and I'm so glad she did. I became an instant fan! This show is very smartly portrayed.

B0012GTZC0|5.0|The suspense kept me reading as fast as I could. Although the plot moved through a few different parties, it helped to keep the story line flowing.  Well done!
B0098VXBIA|3.0|Whatever your preconceived idea about this movie is, you're probably right. It's predictable, but it's not bad. There were some laughable moments throughout the movie.
B0056C6XIA|5.0|The best multi tool that I have ever owned.......the torch comes in handy and the multi tool it's self has been well made and finished, I would highly recommend this product 10/10
B00BHMETKC|5.0|I was completely floored after watching this movie. Ben Affleck did an amazing job with all the hats he wore for this film. He has definitely shown how far he can stretch his creative wings. I found the whole movie from start to finish to be gripping. A must see!
B006M9NJFG|5.0|Very strong container......the steel cup comes in handy for a small cook out......and it holds a lot of water....The lid holds nice and tight as I've had a couple where I;ve had probs with the lid but this works well.
B006DHASYM|4.0|I'm not a big Anna Faris fan at all, but I do love Chris Evans. This movie is pretty funny. They play off of each other very well.
B005COO1X6|3.0|I am always, and will likely continue to be sucked in to anything King writes. This is a decent book to fill up your lunch break. The story moves quickly, though the ending left me a bit unfulfilled.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|I thought this movie was great. I rented it, and then went out and bought it a couple days later. It kept me on the edge and wanting more. I was completely surprised by the ending, and I'm very excited to see what's next for the Bond franchise. A very thrilling movie to watch!
B0013ND30M|5.0|I just received this movie and saw it in the theater when I was a kid. It is not only<br />a good movie, but the cinematography is beautiful. Any age can enjoy this movie
B007BFSYMS|5.0|I got this to mask background sounds and found it to be very relaxing and a good way to escape stressful mind sets!
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This collection was a great value and also a ton of fun to play. It really has beautiful graphics and I would highly recommend to play it.
B00139W3NE|4.0|Loved the movie.  A great family movie, everyone will enjoy it.  Nicole Kidman is great in every movie I've seen of her.
B007KQI1NA|5.0|I have used GPS devices for many years and this receiver uses the latest revision of the leading chip system. Outstanding sensitivity.
B0015ABRE2|4.0|I can hardly wait for the next season to be available on DVD.  Have purchased all of the series to date and enjoy watching them all.  (don't have cable TV)
B008YU0AOE|3.0|I don't really think you should have to BUY the full thing to get the skins. But that's just me being stingy. I know it's only 99 cents, but I don't see it being worth it when I could buy a favorite song for that much.
B0000DD79B|4.0|Great music...so happy to add this to my library.  Have always enjoyed the music from Simon & Garfunkel...great harmony, great singing voices.
B005HSL626|2.0|Not working properly.<br /><br />no no no noo non non non nononnononon nonon no non no non non no no no
B000OVLBGC|4.0|Quirky story...but it held my interest.  Sad that this guy dedicated so much time and effort to recording everything from others.
B0092S4WLY|2.0|Not that great, but okay if you have low expectations.<br /><br />words words words words words words words words words words
B00005JNQA|4.0|This movie kept my interest throughout.  Am happy with the purchase.  Nicole Kidman is a great performer and &#34;The Interpreter&#34;<br />Will not disappoint you.
B006YC74E8|4.0|It's alright for quick little fix ups and such. I love old Polaroid photos so the effect on here made my life.
B001PPLJIQ|4.0|This movie held my interest from beginning to end.  It's the kind of story you can watch again and again.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I suppose it is quite obvious why I love this game. Even though I doubt most bronies find this game worth their time, I've always been a fan of wasting time I need to use for doing important essays with by playing games like Cityville, yoville and this. Though It's been kinda buggy lately.
B000002UZ1|4.0|Oh, the Beattles were great songsters.  I'm very glad I purchased this album and intend to enjoy it on my long rides to wherever my car takes me.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfers is a fun and original game which is appropriate for all ages<br /><br />It is really fun and it is both easy and difficult amazing game family friendly also you can compare scores with friends via Facebook
B003M7BLOW|5.0|This was just what I needed to breath new life into my system. I thought about getting the 965 BE, but opted for this. No regrets. I play a lot of games including GW2, ST:TOR and TF2. Performance has improved a lot. Shipping was great. Install was easy.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game is very important to a big group of people and if this game would leave we would not have anything to play
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is AWESOME!  It's fun for kids and I enjoy playing it sooooooo<br /> much!  I can never quit this game!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I read all the time.  I love to be able to take my books with me in my pocket note an extra bag. I do love the feel of a book in my hand too. This is more convenient.
B00013M6NK|5.0|This OEM battery is a great accessory to my Nikon COOLPix P510. It provides additional time to shoot so that you don't have to feel rushed or worry about running out of power. It's so small that it takes up little or no space in your camera bag, fitting in any small pouch. Since it's OEM, I have confidence that it shares the same high level of quality that one expects from Nikon.
B0041QSZJM|4.0|One of the most popular bands of late. Great to see live for all audiences. Songs are fresh and fun. 12-piece little orchestra from Oregon keeps on entertaining.
B002SR2PKG|4.0|This book will take you their.  I`ve read, watched and most certainly felt many of King`s other titles available here in the jungle.<br /><br />I choose a 4 star, because right now I really dig this number.  I read this story very young, I`m 37 and read his work in the 80`s.  This arrangement of words forms that world of Macob.<br /><br />Follow the little boy and his sail boat, The wild smashing of the bashing.<br />It is just one of those beasts.<br />If your looking for bunnies find a petting zoo, Ya dig;<br /><br />Cause what`s good 4 the bacon,<br />Usually stinks 4 The Pig,
B007BVMVDU|5.0|This is a great series, full of drama, action, and intrigue.  It is geared for adults, so censorship hasn't ruined the reality of certain situation.  Check out the first episode and you will be hooked.
067003830X|5.0|I bought this book as a close friend had a stroke at a young age. This book not only helped me to understand in laymans terms what was going on in her brain, it also gave us hope -  that the brain is not &#34;static&#34; as Doctors 1st believed, but is &#34;plastic&#34; and can be changed. The examples in the book were remarkable stories of recovery, not complete but certainly enough to have a much better quality of life. I have passed this book on to another friend who has developed Motor Neurone Disease. I would recommend anyone and everyone to read it, even small parts of it, as no-one is immune to brain injury and hope is the most important thing in life. The brain is truly an amazing organ.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|Great continuation of the first season.  This series is top notch.  The next season can't be released fast enough for me.
B001KDQ4KQ|4.0|I particularly enjoyed the legal drama.  The direct examination and cross examination in the courtroom was thrilling.  One has to contemplate a whole host of emotion brought about by  hairpin turns in the plot.  I took a break from reading historical nonfiction and this was a perfect change of pace for me.  All in all, very well written, unusual story line--I recommend it.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|This movie shows one of the reasons I like dogs. Its a well made film, though I'll warn you, it might bring a tear to your eye.
0634022296|5.0|No one can ever top the Beatles in all time, all around music production. Their music will live on long after they and myself are gone. There are so many of the songs that are just plain fun to sing and perform. Thanks for again brightening my life with music of john, paul, ringo and george.
B008JFUO0Y|4.0|I think it is safe to say that Evil Dead is one of the best horror remakes ever. It is similar enough to the original (although much more serious, with little humor), but feels like more of a sequel instead of a copy. It does start off a little slow with some less than realistic dialogue, but it picks up as soon as they find that twisted brown book. From then to the end it is non-stop gore, gore and more gore. I don't know how they got away with some of this stuff. I've seen much worse, but it doesn't hold anything back. For a lower budget film, the make-up and thankfully non-CGI effects are some of the best in recent memory. There are a few creepy moments, but I wouldn't call this movie scary. The cast is good for this genre, but the only real standout is Jane Levy as the main girl who gets possessed. She goes through every emotion and is very believable.<br /><br />They showed the new trailer for the remake of Carrie and it looks to be another good stab at a classic.<br /><br />Evil Dead is worthy of my Blu-ray horror collection.
034580404X|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this trilogy. Will read again and again!  I loved the characters and could feel what they were feeling. Its a must read!!!!
B009GED3HS|5.0|I am a big fan of How I Met Your Mother. Truthfully, one of the funniest comedies on television today.
B008KYOCA2|1.0|I just needed a simple calendar. This actually makes it harder! It has nothing of what i needed. This is absolutely ridiculous they need to take this off the market!!!!!!!!!!!!! IMMEDIATELY
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This started out as my 4yr old son's game. When he asked me if I wanted to play, I had no idea that it was fun & addictive. Now we help each other get coins to get stuff. I also like how they update it for the season &/or holiday.  Last update has a few glitches where it sticks for a second but still all over good app.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|This book was the best of all three it had it all makes you laugh,cry,mad,and laugh some moor great job E L James

B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I hadn't heard much about this movie before watching it and I was pleasantly surprised. It is very funny and the voices pack real star-power. My 7 year old son loved it, as did my teenage niece and nephews and all the adults in the room. great family entertainment.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|Una gran película muy disfrutable, un verdadero clasico, por eso quise conseguirla en blu ray.<br />Gran trabajo d elos actores y muy buenos maquillajes<br />La película merece la pena tenerla en mi colección personal
B00A757EFW|3.0|It was not like the original game, because there was no way to control the direction of the yellow men.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|Comfortable to hold and easy to position. Lightweight and protective. Makes the kindle easy to carry, hold and store. I love it.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Was it the singing? was it the acting? was it the awesome setting and costumes? Or was it just the power of the story line itself.  So human, but so divine.  Seldom have I been moved to tears, but I wept.  Seven stars!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|I love Gillian Flynn's work and really enjoyed this book.  It hooks you in and grips you until the end!
B005H9B44A|4.0|It was enjoyable. It was a good movie for a night when we just wanted to watch something that didn't make us think too much.

B00BI5IXL4|1.0|Would have loved to watch this movie on a flight, but as a first time movie buyer from Amazon, found their library management, instructions and representations about devices supported to be terrible.  Every time I go to &#34;Want to download this video&#34; it takes me to Kindle instructions with impossible to find detail on my Samsung mobile device.  Will be using another service.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I enjoy this game so much! There are so many things you can unlock and try that it doesn't get boring. And it's free so it's even better!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It is the best way better than temple run I love it I would give it more than a million stars for this app or game!
B007N85POS|4.0|I must admit i was caught playig for alot longer than i ever expect myself ( a non gamer) i just think this is simple and a mind rester that is ok for all ages.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game. It's a great way to pass the time. The graphics are bright and colorful. All in all it's a good game
B003EY7IRC|5.0|Awesomeness..... that would be my one  word to describe it... but they make you put more... what a shame, they should allow one word reviews! lol
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This is seriously one of the best books ever. You learn about Greek and Roman history. This book is also jammed packed full of adventure. This is also probably the best book in the series.
