B000002ILG|4.0|Awesome album. Im 33 Years old and a first time listener to White Lion. I heard of them for a number of years but for some reason or another, I never bought their album. But man i'm sure glad I did. Get the album. It's good time Heavy Metal, party rock songs about love and rockin' the night. A1 grade for guitar players as this album has awesome guitar work with vocals that match perfectlly.
B000009ED0|5.0|every song on her rules right up till you get to fist of rage but after that one it's all good again. everything is pieced together perfect. one country song and the rest are a combo of rap/hiphop/rock/hard rock/metal/techno. he is awesome and this is his debut so you gotta love that no matter what! he features Eminem, Joe C., Twisted Trucker Band, Misty Love and TIno all in this masterpiece. <br /> <br />2 best songs: cowboy & f*** off! <br /> <br />2 worst songs: fist of rage & where u at rock
B000000YIQ|5.0|Sonny Rollins, one of the most influential tenor saxophonists in the history of jazz. His deep tone, influenced by Coleman Hawkins and Ben Webster. Sonny Rollins is my favorite tenor saxophonist.  <br /> <br />Sonny is a very unique musician. Some of his ideas are very experimental, but his overall message, just swing! In this interesting format, tenor sax-bass-drums, Sonny shows his stuff, and plays his heart out. <br /> <br />In jazz, tenor sax trios are fairly rare. Here, Ray Brown on bass and Shelly Manne on drums help Sonny out by delivering this swinging session. <br /> <br />Obviously, the theme of this album was westerns. The old western standard I'm an Old Cowhand, is done here by Newk and the gang. Rollins' original Wagon Wheels is very catchy.  <br /> <br />Sonny Rollins had some great albums in his career, and this one should be considered to be among the best.

B0007TKNL0|3.0|Some musicals were meant to be transformed to the silver screen (Chicago was excellant, the classic Rodgers & Hammerstein shows, and several others).  Unfortunately, not Phantom.  The movie just took away too much from the experience of seeing the phenomenon on stage where you actually sit in front of the performers as it happens night after night live.  The magic is lost on the screen.  However, that being said, there was some good in the movie.  The background scene in which Madame Giri tells Raoul about the young child who became the Phantom was nice.  Since the beginning, I have always felt that the casting of the title character was way off.  Why cast a young, handsome man when everyone knows that he is to be portrayed much older than Christine and be disfigured.  He is supposed to be a substitute for her dead father.  I have often wondered why Michael Crawford was not offered the role.  However, Emmy Rossum does do a fine job as Christine.  Patrick Wilson is fine as Raoul; I never liked the part...too boring.  I do not know if a different casting would have helped at all, but if you really want the Phantom experience, make the trip to see the magic of the \\"Music of the Night\\" on stage.

B00005AXEL|4.0|In 2001, seven years after releasing her sixth album, STREET ANGEL, Stevie Nicks released her seventh album entitled, TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA. When I first listen to this albumm, I was not all too impressed with this album, prompting me to give it only four stars, the same way I had treated Stevie's 1989 album, THE OTHER SIDE OF THE MIRROR. But, I had to hear the album a second time, just like her 1989 album. I had listened to it with an even more opened mind and I fell in love with the album. Unfortunately, I can't go back and change my four-star rating to a five-star rating, but this edited review should tell you all that I changed my opinion.    TROUBLE IN SHANGRI-LA    The album's title track. At first, when I heard this song, I thought to myself that the album was off to great start, since I really favor this song on this album.    CANDLEBRIGHT    I love the title to this song, along with Stevie's excellent vocals.    SORCERER    This one is just excellent, with an excellent music video.    PLANETS OF THE UNIVERSE    Great song.    EVERYDAY    Another amazing song.    TOO FAR FROM TEXAS    Awesome tune.    THAT MADE ME STRONGER    I was not too crazy about this, until I gave it a second chance. There are many things that can make us all stronger.    IT'S ONLY LOVE    Another great song.    LOVE CHANGES    Great.    I MISS YOU    Amazing.    BOMBAY SAPPHIRE    I really enjoy this song in every way possible.     FALL FROM GRACE    At first, I thought Stevie might have covered Heart's song entitled \\"Fallen From Grace\\", which can be found on their 1990 album, BRIGADE. But I realized that Stevie's song is entitled, \\"Fall From Grace\\", not \\"Fallen From Grace\\", thus making it a Stevie Nicks original, with a slight similarity in the title, as Heart's song. This is another highlight from this album.    LOVE IS    Unbelievable. Words cannot really describe any of the songs on this album, which is why I haven't given too much info on them.         As I said before, I wasnot too thrilled with this album, when I heard this album for the first time. But things in life deserve second chances, and that is why I changed my opinion on this album. Great buy here.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|There are not 2 other people on the planet that could have played the parts of Heathcliff and Cathy better than Ralph Fiennes and Juliette Binoche.  I was moved to tears.  The movie stayed with me after watching it.  Ralph Fiennes is one of the most amazing actors of our time, possible ever.  He has an innate ability to express emotion and meaning with his eyes and he has never been better at it than in this classic movie. <br />This is truly one of the best movies ever made. <br />10 STARS!!!!!!!

B000005IU2|5.0|This album is like an already demented carnival bottling itself up into pure visceral rage and then nose-diving on a quick descent to hell. By the time you've reached the last song you hear Iggy leopard growling, the carnival barker being burnt by the flames. I'm not quite sure what Wolk is talking about in his editorial review saying the sound is slow and thuddy. To my ears the first Stooges album sounds that way, this album immediately explodes with raw power. The first three tracks are, in my opinion, the finest opening tracks to a hard rock album ever, my personal favorite being the shredding pogo-drum proto-punk \\"TV Eye.\\" After those three tracks things somehow go even crazier. After the spectral, calming creepiness of \\"Dirt\\" the fur really begins flying again, this time devolving even more furiously into primitive howls and animalistic gut-wrenching. Dissonant saxophones get thrown into the molten cauldron mix, piling the madness to its breaking point until finally Iggy drags the whole damned circus right down into the bowels of hell via \\"L.A. Blues.\\" Listening to this album, or any album by the Stooges for that matter, will cure you forever of any unfortunate urge you may have had to listen to a Guns n' Roses album.

0143034901|5.0|This lovely book reflects the author's expertise in bringing characters to life, portraying mood, and presenting an impossible-to-put-down story.  Zafon is an excellent writer, luring the reader along through a fascinating plot that weaves in, out, under and over the lives of his characters.  The evil antagonist is a match for any of the great evildoers presented in novels, reminding me of the good-evil contest in Les Miserables.  I am so glad I discovered this author and hope to see more of his books in translation.
B00004Z459|2.0|This was really annoying. I know that these guys are good musiciansbut they're such wannabes. None of them are black which would be a good excuse and furthermore they suck at rapping. People like Kid Rock and Fred Durst out-white-rapped these guys. The metal parts are the only parts i could stand. hopefully their other cds are better but after this i don't think i could take it.
B0000001PW|4.0|This is one of the best fusion albums to come out in the past twenty years. My only critism is that the synth's and electric guitar become a little to thick at times.  Those of you who are die hard Chick Corea fans will love it. For people who have never listened to him before, this is a great place to start. Great compostions, and great players. As always Chick's incredible musicianship comes shining through all of the electronics. As for me though I still prefer hearing Chick Corea playing in an acoustic setting.
B000002UB6|3.0|Wow.....good CD, what's with the 4 less than one minute songs though. that was the only thing i didn't like. other than that this album is really cool. you should buy it if you love the beatles <br /> <br />2 best songs- let it be & the long and winding road <br /> <br />2 worst songs-one after 909 & dig it

B0000B1OFL|4.0|Extremely well done heist/buddy flick in the vein of, but not as good as THE BOURNE and OCEANS series.  This could be due to the casting.  Mark Wahlberg, who showed such promise in BOOGIE NIGHTS, is unfortunately best suited to beefcake roles.  The uber talented Edward Norton seems woefully unhappy to be in this one (nor does he appear in any of the press materials recut into \\"special features\\") and phones in his most disappointing performance as the turncoat bad guy.  Donald Sutherland pops up to compete with Michael Caine and Charles Durning for the most over-used \\"icon\\" of his generation.  Charlize Theron & Seth Green, however, bring surplus talent and humor to their roles and manage to keep the iffy-ensemble together.  Thank goodness for the stunt work and locations (especially evidenced when you see the ghastly and gratefully deleted scenes)!<br /><br />The music, too, is especially noteworthy and adds greatly to the excitement of this \\"summer\\" movie.<br /><br />The special features are negligible and only reinforce the stereotype that it's best not to let the actors speak anything other than their scripted lines.
B0002OERI0|2.0|they put a lot of effort into this. the whole f***ing CD they're talking about some retard named jimmy. who cares if he died??? this was very annoying. another thing i hated was that only the first 6 songs were really good then the rest sucked. you don't need this one, save ur money. <br /> <br />2 best songs: american idiot & holiday <br /> <br />2 worst songs: wake me up when september ends & st. jimmy
B000002UUX|5.0|What do you get when you mix the songwriting skills of Dave Mustaine with Marty Friedman's (former Cacophony member) ability to play leads of the most scorching sort? You get the single greatest metal album ever (perhaps tied with Stained Class). Rust in Peace is not only Megadeth's finest moment, but it was the pinnacle of speed/thrash metal. The dazzling solos, the headbanging and varied riffs (not just a bunch of e-string progressions), and the poigant lyrics mesh perfectly to form the finished product. Hottest tracks include Holy Wars and Hangar 18.
B00004Y6NP|5.0|During the 1985 Live Aid concert, Dire Straits' live performances of \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Sultans of Swing\\" would become one of the highlights of the Live Aid Concert.    It was also the momentum from Live Aid that propelled \\"Money For Nothing\\" to #1 song status.   It was the success of this song that would also launch 1985's \\"Brothers in Arms\\" to #1 album status.   Throughout their career, Dire Straits, they would do things much differently than many of the other bands during the \\"British Invasion\\" that was taking place.   In an era where Punk and New Wave were taking center stage, Dire Straits were doing things the old-fashioned way:  a combination of Classic Rock, Blues, Folk, and even some Country.     \\"Brothers in Arms\\" would utilize this unique blend of genres that has been a staple of their musical careers.     Not only would \\"Brothers in Arms\\" become a huge commercial success - it would also be a high quality effort. <br /> <br />For the most part, Dire Straits is the brainchild of its lead guitarist and vocalist - Mark Knopfler.   Throughout his career, Knopfler would assemble a group of musicians that would comprise Dire Straits.   While the only constant besides Knopfler has been Bassist John Illsley,  Knopfler would succeed at bringing in high quality musicians to support the unique blend of music he would write.    Knopfler is widely considered one of music's legendary guitarists.  While \\"Brothers in Arms\\" showcases why Knopfler is worthy of this honor, there are also many high quality instrumentation efforts by the other members of the band.   In addition to an album that is well written from both and musical and lyrical standpoint, it is going to be the great performances by Dire Straits as a whole that is going to make this a very special album. <br /> <br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\" is also a famous album because it was one of the first albums to be released in an \\"all digital format\\".   Back in 1985, \\"Brothers in Arms\\" was one of the best sounding albums around from a recording standpoint.   Now, add the fact that \\"Brothers in Arms\\" has been remastered and you really hear the difference.   The music on this collection is going to reflect this quality - having an almost \\"three dimensional effect\\". <br /> <br />While \\"Money for Nothing\\" is probably the band's best-known song, there are many other tracks on this album.   While one can make the argument that \\"Brothers in Arms\\" shows a lack of contuinity from a musical standpoint,  Dire Straits gives \\"A1\\" performances on just about every track.   What the album lacks in musical continuity, it makes up for in musical depth.    Here is a track by track review. <br /> <br />\\"So Far Away\\":  When this song was played on the radio, it didn't blow me away.   Listening to this remastered version gives me a new appreciation.  Here is a song where Knopfler is not the star - John Islley provides some terrific Bass work (especially the opener) while Guy Fletcher and Alan Clark provide some terrific Keyboard work. <br /> <br />\\"Money For Nothing\\":  This is the legendary song co-written and co-performed by Sting.  This is the full version of the song - not the badly butchered radio-edit that was heard on radio (and unfortunately was included on the Dire Straits compilation \\"Sultans of Swing: The Very Best of Dire Straits\\").   Several factors are going to highlight this very complete song:   The unique blend of vocals between Knopfler and Sting; the legendary guitar work by Knopfler;  some outstanding drum work (particularly right before Knopfler's legendary guitar solo), and of course, the humorous lyrics from the standpoint of two blue-collar workers making fun of Rock Stars (this song seems to have stood the test of time). <br /> <br />\\"Walk of Life\\":  This is the one \\"pop\\" song on the album.  Many criticize this song because of the use of the electric organ, but I think it blends well with Knopfler's guitar chords.  While it isn't the best track on the collection, it does provide a bit of a retro sound and show Dire Straits' versatility. <br /> <br />\\"Your Latest Trick\\":  This has become a legendary song by Dire Straits.  Knopfler's guitar won't be the star here.  The horn work is going to really distinguish this song - combined with Knopfler's vocals of course.  It has an R&B feel to open the song.  This is also a well written song as well. <br /> <br />\\"Why Worry\\": Knopfler's guitar work is outstanding - you can almost pick it out note by note.  This is the album's longest track - and well worth the 8+ minutes of music - particularly the instrumental to close this song. This is really good stuff. <br /> <br />\\"Ride Across the River\\":  This is a very underrated song.  The song opens with a cross of an African and Latin sound.   Knopfler's guitar takes on almost a \\"Carlos Santana\\" feel in this song.  There are also some clever use of horns in this song. <br /> <br />\\"The Man's Too Strong\\":  This is a song where Dire Straits show some of the Folk Music influence.   Knopfler's guitar work is again outstanding. <br /> <br />\\"One World\\":  This is a Bluesy track with a touch of Country.  Nice guitar work by Knopfler and nice Bass work by Illsley. <br /> <br />\\"Brothers in Arms\\": At first I asked myself how this song ever became the title track for such a great album - I felt it was too \\"soft\\".   However, the more I listen to it - the more I liked it.  Once again, Knopfler's guitar almost has a \\"Carlos Santana\\" feel to it.  The song has a bit of a dark side to it when you compare it to the upbeat \\"Money for Nothing\\" and \\"Walk of Life\\" <br /> <br />The liner notes contain all of the lyrics to it.  Some of the credits are incomplete (namely the horn credits).   Overall, this is not just a great recording, but a great body of work.  It is one of the album's you will appreciate more each time you hear it.  Highly recommended.
B000001ESP|5.0|Moving Pictures is nothing short of epic. It showcases Peart's intelligent, individualistic lyrics and a trio of technical skills yet to be matched in the genre or any other. In no other band is there such a dense concentration of songwriting and technical skills. It's this virtuosity that sets this album apart from other prog offerings. Solos, fills, and riffs of the highest calibur are showcased here. Garage bands don't refrain from covering Rush songs because they don't like the prog trio, but rather because they can't. There are few bands that have the skills to play YYZ live note for note. At any rate, this is an album worth an intent listen at the very least.

B00070Q7VO|5.0|The DreamTeam of Tony LiPuma, David Foster and Michael Buble have combined to create a treasure on It's Time. Each brought their own special talent to the fore and the result is this spectacular album. It's fresh, vibrant and a dream catcher.  <br /> <br />Given the vocal talent and appeal of Michael it should come as no surprise that his second major label album has succeeded worldwide and appealed to audiences of all ages. His current USA tour will solidify an already significant fan base and hopefully his label (Warner Brothers) will see fit to encourage him to record many more albums and allow him the freedom to use his song writing gift to create more songs in the vein of his number one heart, and chart topper song, \\"Home\\".  <br /> <br />It's Michael Buble's Time, that's for sure.
B0007OY2MG|5.0|For the third season in a row, THE GILMORE GIRLS excelled as the show in which absolutely nothing happened and yet in which everything happened. The show at times seems like the work of illusionists. The main plot of one early season episode? Lorelai is asked to water the yard of a new neighbor. Not a lot of seeming potential in that, and in fact there is minimal exploitation of the situation. The tone of the show is definitely that of a comedy, yet it is never a situational one. If you could time warp the writers of I LOVE LUCY into the future to see the show, they would be baffled.<br /><br />As always, the show is driven by the great dialogue and talk, but it is also structured around a number of long-to-resolve issues. Will Rory get into Harvard? Will she go there? Will Rory end up with Dean or Jess? Will Lorelai end up with anyone? Will Lorelai and Sookie get their inn? All of these questions get answered, not always in the ways that we anticipated. But this is one of those shows where what happens is of interest only because we like and care about the characters. \\"What will happen next?\\" is not a question that tortures the viewers of the show. 24 and THE GILMORE GIRLS inhabit different television universes.<br /><br />By Season Three we have come to love all the ritualistic aspects of the show. Ritual has always played a crucial role in great comedy, from the always-repeating antics of Laurel and Hardy to the never-ending adventures of the Roadrunner and Coyote to Kenny's tendency to die over and over. On THE GILMORE GIRLS we have grown to anticipate a new maid each week at the Gilmore residence in Hartford. And a new crusade by Taylor, as well as a new occupation or obsession by Kirk each week. Structurally, things like these are necessities on a show such as this one that is not driven by plot.<br /><br />While I thoroughly love the show, I do have to utter a couple of words of complaint. As someone who got a graduate degree at Yale (and therefore lack somewhat the love that undergraduates feel for their alma maters), and decided to go to Yale over Harvard, I was always perplexed by the Harvard mono-mania. The folks I knew at Yale always considered Yale to be the better school, though most of us would have swapped New Haven for Cambridge. But I want to object to a couple of other details that were a tad off. First, in \\"Let the Games Begin\\" they visit \\"Yale,\\" which was apparently a public park in California in which they put a fake \\"Yale University\\" sign to make the unsuspecting imagine that Yale might look like that. In fact, the fictional Yale bears utterly no resemblance to the actual Yale. There were statues on this campus, and although my memory could be playing tricks, I can recall no statues on campus apart from the very famous one of Nathan Hale (of which imitations exist in front of the Chicago Tribune Building on North Michigan Avenue and in front of the CIA Headquarters, which was largely founded by Yale graduates--well, Skull and Bones members to be even more precise) that stands in front of Connecticut Hall, where I used to take philosophy classes. Also, a good deal of the plot at one part turns on Rory getting a financial aid offer a few months after getting into Yale. Anyone who has gotten into a major university knows that financial aid offers almost always arrive at the time of the admission offer.<br /><br />Still, carping aside, another great season. I'd like to point out as I have in previous reviews that several people have told me how Lorelai and Rory remind them of my daughter and me. But the imp in me has to point out that my daughter's SATs were much higher than Rory's :) Anyone thinking such parental boasting inappropriate need only think of the season finale, where Lorelai intentionally goes hunting for Rory, asking for her daughter the class valedictorian. The end of the year, however, clearly marks a transition point. Rory will be off to Yale in Season Four, and Lorelai will be leaving the fire-damaged Independence Inn for her and Sookie's new Dragonfly Inn. Clearly, great things await!ing the fire-damaged Independence Inn for her and Sookie's new Dragonfly Inn. Clearly, great things await!
B000AARKOO|5.0|This is something else all togehter. It will not be what you expect, because no expecation can match the power this movie delivers. Who knew Orlando Bloom could act, much less be so powerful next to Liam Neeson and Jeremy Irons . Save your $4 at blockbuster becasue after renting it you will want to buy it. The greatest story about becoming a man, since El Cid. For those of you struggling through with gaining your fathers approval or meeting your parents expectations, see this movie with them.
B000068FUM|5.0|Marc Olson's last album with the Jayhawks turned out to be their finest, and while Gary Louris and the others in the band would continue to turn out amazingly decent music, there is no question that there was something magical about the collaboration between Olson and Louris.  If one turns from TOMORROW THE GREEN GRASS to the almost equally superb SOUND LIES, the first following the departure of Olson for a solo career, one notices immediately the lack of several things.  For one thing, Olson brought a far rootsier, country edge to the band, and while there is nothing wrong with Louris's more pop-oriented take on things, it is a difference.  Also, SOUND OF LIES lacks completely the marvelous vocal harmonies that Olson and Louris managed together.  After this album, one notices how nicely Louris sings, but there is nothing quite as exciting as hearing Olson and Louris knocking out the lyrics together.  All in all, while I continued to enjoy the Jayhawks after Olson left, I would have greatly preferred that he had stayed.<br /><br />The songs on this album are so good that it is almost impossible for one to stand out on its own.  The weakest cuts would stand out on most other albums, and the strongest are strong indeed.  They manage to create both a number of stellar upbeat songs.  They also one amazing slow number in the beautiful \\"Two Hearts,\\" but turn it around to rock very hard on the edgy \\"Real Light.\\"  On the other hand, \\"See Him On the Street,\\" one of the strongest cuts on the album, is as alt-country as one could hope, while \\"Blue,\\" that starts off the album, presages the more pop-oriented feel of post-Olson albums.  All of which is to say that the Jayhawks had at this point reach a versatility in their playing that could be both exhilarating.<br /><br />The songwriting of Marc Olson and Gary Louris sometimes overshadowed just how outstanding these guys were as musicians.  This is an amazingly tight band, both instrumentally and vocally.  Karen Grotberg joined the band on this one as keyboards, and added a dimension missing on previous albums, while the use of strings (!) embellishes a number of songs, including the great song \\"I'd Run Away,\\" which I'd have to admit--if someone really pushed me--is my favorite cut on the album.<br /><br />All good things come to an end, and unfortunately Marc Olson's time with the band he founded came to an end.  Although I'm delighted with what Gary Louris was able to achieve with the band following the departure of Olson, I still wish the guys had found a way to collaborate for a couple of more albums first.  As it is, this album ought to belong on any list of the essential albums to own.joined the band on this one as keyboards, and added a dimension missing on previous albums, while the use of strings (!) embellishes a number of songs, including the great song \\"I'd Run Away,\\" which I'd have to admit--if someone really pushed me--is my favorite cut on the album. <br /> <br />All good things come to an end, and unfortunately Marc Olson's time with the band he founded came to an end.

B0000931QR|5.0|I LOVE THIS CD!!! I was in a music store looking for a Nek cd, an Italian singer (check him out if you don't know who he is--he's italian but also sings in spanish), but they had never heard of Nek. So I was determined to get SOMETHING. I nearly got a cd in Arabic (I have a thing for languages) but it was between that and this. They had those things where you can scan a cd and listen to clips of songs, so I was doing that by picking up random cds from the World Music rack. When I came across La Oreja de Van Gogh, I thought, well this sounds pretty good; I'll take a risk and get it.<br /><br />I am sooo glad that I bought it! It's such a great group--the tunes really stay in your head. My favs are: Puedes Contar Conmigo, Rosas, Geografia, Tu y Yo, Vestido Azul, Perdoname, and La Paz de Tus Ojos.<br /><br />Really, ALL of them are great. The last track is a little weird because it doesn't have many lyrics and it's just like a dance number, but it's not bad.<br /><br />Buy this cd, you will not regret it! It's one of my favorite cds right now, I love it!!
0446608955|2.0|Having read all of Nicholas Sparks' books, I was excited to read A Walk To Remember.  I was very disappointed in the predictability and language used in this book.  I agree with some of the other reviewers when they say they were sick of Landon saying, \\"if you know what I mean.\\"  The plot was just ok; very cliche.  This wasn't typical of the writing of Sparks--it was more \\"basic.\\"  What I like about his books are the surprises.  A Walk To Remember lacked that element of surprise, and that's the main reason for my low rating.  Another reason for the 2 stars is that I have high expectations of Nicholas Sparks' books.  This one was a disappointment.
B00006LHYC|3.0|First of all, Laura is soooo much better in Italian and Spanish!!! Although I do like a few tracks on this cd: Without You, Surrender, I Need Love, If That's Love, and It's Not Goodbye, you can really tell that Laura did not write these songs--especially in \\"Love Comes from the Inside\\"--it just doesn't make any sense!! Everyday is a Monday has the same tune as Il Mio Sbaglio Piu Grande/Un Error de Los Grandes, but the lyrics are completely different and it's better in italian/spanish. It's Not Goodbye also has the same tune as En Ausencia de Ti/In assenza di Te, but I like it about the same in English.<br /><br />My favorite tracks are I Need Love and Without You. I Need Love is just great all over, and Without You is so beautiful you just melt into Laura's voice.<br /><br />If you're thinking about getting this CD, go for it because despite some bad spots it is a good cd, but she is a much stronger singer in Italian/Spanish. Try out some of her other cds, you won't be disappointed!
0895260131|5.0|This is a great book that everyone in the West should read. It is easy to read and the chapters are short enough to read one or two at a time if you don't have hours to spend each day reading. It covers everything from treatment of non muslims under muslim rule, treatment of and ideas about women in islam, to why we can't make peace with the muslims (not because of our attitude but theirs). Then the book gives a great account of the Crusades and why they were fought and how it was the muslims that nearly took Europe by force 100s of years before the Crusades began.  <br /> <br />It has side bars that range from comparisons between Jesus and muhammed (the Bible and the qur'an). The side bars also show current or recent events in the muslim world that support the main text. These show that those following the religion are following it the same way it is explained in the book. This means that the readings from the qur'an or other islamic sources used are not just taking the verses out of context. They are being practiced in the real world exactly how they are written and shown in the book. The text and side bars even give quotes from islamic scholars and writings (from both shi'a and sunni schools of thought) that show their full support of the verses cited. This would indicate that the verses are the basis for islamic law and behavior and not misquotes by the author.  <br /> <br />Finally the side bars also give other books and works to read if you want to get deeper into the problem of islam. These include the qur'an itself to islamic law manuals that are used today that again support how the verses are quoted in the book.  <br /> <br />The only downside to the book is that it's only a basic book and skips a lot of detail and therefore easy to read. The book is a very good start if you want to know the truth but don't have time for in depth research. Its also good if you want a starting point to begin research especially with the references to other reading material.This book is not islamophobic but a great read as to the problems we face today including our own PC stupidity and rewriting of history to demonize ourselves.

B00004Y6O7|4.0|Thoughts about Fair Warning after listening to it for the first time in roughly 10 years... <br /> <br />A few months ago I found myself ravenously hungry for Fair Warning.  I hadn't given the album much thought over the past decade, but for some reason it found its way back into my head recently and I just couldn't be satisfied until I heard it again.  Fifteen years ago, I used to own Fair Warning on LP and have long considered it to be my favorite Van Halen album.  However, since I no longer own a record player, I recently found myself needing Fair Warning on CD and needing it fast.  I hurried over to Best Buy and was pleased to see that a remastered version of the cd retailed for 11 bucks.  I barely stopped long enough to pay the cashier on my way out and expertly slid the cd into my car stereo.   <br /> <br />The intro to \\"Mean Streets\\" blasted out of my speakers and a smile crept across my face.  Could the song always have been this good?  By the conclusion of \\"Mean Streets\\", I had a feeling Fair Warning was going to be even better than I remembered it.  Then came \\"Dirty Movies\\" and I was reminded that Van Halen sometimes favored lasciviously cheesy lyrics.  To call \\"Dirty Movies\\" disposable would be generous.  When \\"Sinners Swing!\\" came on, I grimaced again.  Did I ever really like this drek?  What sort of chorus is \\"Get, get, get, get, get out and push\\"?  \\"Hear About it Later\\" is Van Halen toning down the rawk and trying to sound sensitive.  Instead, they end up sounding like crap for the third straight song.  At least \\"Unchained\\" musically continues to live up to its classic reputation, though that whole \\"come on Dave, give me a break\\" nonsense lays on a cheese veneer that's gone stale over time.  \\"Push Comes to Shove\\" and especially \\"So This is Love\\" make a respectable attempt at rescuing the album from banality.  However, \\"Sunday Afternoon in the Park\\" and \\"One Foot Out the Door\\" have to come along and drag it back down again.   <br /> <br />Hungry as I was for Fair Warning when I bought it, I found myself quite full after only a single helping.  If I made a practice of selling my disappointing cds, my copy of Fair Warning would be a strong candidate for appearing in a used cd bin near you.  However, luckily for you, I don't sell my cds so you can ignore that ridiculous urge you have to buy my copy.  I told you, Fair Warning really isn't much good.  Someone said Fair Warning - oh yeah, that was me - don't buy this cd! <br /> <br />Thoughts about Fair Warning after listening to it for a second time in about 10 years... <br /> <br />Hmm, now I'm starting to worry about the review I wrote above.  Maybe one's opinion of Fair Warning depends on one's mood.  I listened to it again this afternoon and found myself really enjoying it.  The guitar playing and overall production sound are both very pleasing.  I think what the album suffers from is a dearth of catchy hooks and a surfeit of uninspired lyrics.  Fallen prom queens, nights out chasing tail, lots of patented David Lee Roth squawks - pretty standard fare for Van Halen.  My initial inclination had been to give Fair Warning 2 stars and shake my head in disbelief at my musical tastes in high school.  However, having listened to it again and finding myself genuinely enjoying it despite its lyrical juvenilia, I'm starting to think 4 stars might not be too generous.  Especially if you find yourself in the same mood for guitar-shredding 80s party rock I unexpectedly found myself in this afternoon.     <br /> <br />The third time's the charm... <br /> <br />OK, after a third listen, I'm finally ready to confirm Fair Warning as a highly enjoyable 4 star album. I apologize to any band members or fans whom I may have offended with my initial impressions, but leave my earlier comments in this review as a cautionary tale to those myriad Amazon reviewers who are overly eager to review albums. Knee-jerk reviewers are a plague on this site and are ready to proclaim a new album a masterpiece or a colossal failure within days of its release. It's taken me 20 years to pinpoint exactly how I feel about Fair Warning - the least we amateur reviewers can do is live with a new album for a few months before passing judgement.
B00066R4T8|4.0|Touching the Void will take you on an incredible journey with the author as he struggles to overcome a disasterous accident in the Peruvian Andes.  From when he arrives in the area and begins with day hikes to the accident and through to the end, the author paints such a realistic picture that it easy to imagine yourself there.  That makes this a hard book to put down.
0552149519|3.0|With all the talk about the Da Vinci Code, I decided to pick it up and have a read. I personally prefer Brown's Angels and Demons to this book. Dan Brown is a convincing writer, and I am surprised at how many people take the Da Vinci Code as truths and rejects the Bible. There are enough books and coumentaries to counter the claims of the Da Vinci Code, and the concept that Brown brought up that Jesus had a wife in Mary Magdalene and they had children are not new. It was brought forth in another fictional book marketed as historical \\"The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail\\" by Michael Baigent, Richard Leigh, Henry Lincoln.<br /><br />The acclaim that this book is getting is like the movie \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" years ago. Know that when you read the Da Vinci Code, it is fictional, and it was not marketed as fiction for nothing! It is a fun read, none the less, and what keeps the book moving is not only the plot, but that the whole book is written almost as a minute to minute account of what was happening, displaying in full view for the reader the action and suspense that it brings.
0385338686|5.0|I was so excited when I saw the new Sophie Kinsella book was out...I bought it and saved it to take on vacation.  My only problem with it was that it was over too fast...I read it in one and a half days.   <br /> <br />I was a little worried how Sophie would realistically get a city lawyer into a situation where she would willingly be a housekeeper but I was pleasantly surprised at the turn of events.  If you have ever found a late bill or unknowingly missed a huge deadline then you can relate to the state of shock and stupification that Samantha Sweeting found herself in.   <br /> <br />Her adventures in housekeeping were hilarious.  I am now looking to buy my own Nimbus 2000 model ironing board! <br /> <br />I thought this story was Kinsella's best one since the Shopaholic series.
B0002IQHZM|5.0|Sunshine Superman morphs into Bohemian Batman on this superb outing by Donovan. When I heard about the concept of this album -- Donovan trying to recreate the sound and ambiance of Soho beat cafe circa 1962 -- I thought it sounded like a desperate gimmick by a fading rock superstar. But it works big time, thanks in no small part to the dream-team support of accoustic bassist Danny Thompson (Richard Thompson, Pentangle) and solo-Beatles drummer Jim Keltner, who swing and sizzle along with Donovan's acoustic guitar grooves. The only thing that doesn't really work is the recitation of Dylan Thomas' \\"Do Not Go Gentle,\\" (but it is a great theme for the record and one that Donovan seems to be taking to heart). Every other track on the album is a gem. This is Don's best album since the criminally overlooked Cosmic Wheels back in the early 1970s, and possibly the best of his 40-year career. I can't think of a single one my many favorite rock artists from the 1960s or 1970s (many of whom are still recording and performing) of whom I can say they trumped their catalog at close to age 60! Watch out world -- The Hurdy Gurdy Man is still crankin'!
0140557741|5.0|I learned about this book a few years ago in a teambuilding workshop and finally decided to get a copy for myself.  It still blows my mind.  A great aide for getting people to \\"think outside the box\\".    For teambuilding, I plan to remove each page and have them all laminated.  then, pass them out to a group, each person getting one page.  They may not show their page to anyone, but must talk to others in the group to figure out what all the pages have in common. It gets groups started talking and everyone ends up having to interact with everyone else!
0895260131|5.0|Just like his others I had become very familier with Islamic.<br /><br /> scripoture long before I ever read Spencer or visited Jihadwatch.<br /><br />Some reviewers have misreprestented The book  and are practing  Taqiyya  lying with a purpose.<br /><br />I recommend studying Islamic scripture  this book is a good guide and offers suggested reading material including the Quran.<br /><br />Noble Qur'an 2:190 Footnote: \\"Jihad is holy fighting in Allah's Cause with full force of numbers and weaponry. It is given the utmost importance in Islam and is one of its pillars. By Jihad Islam is established, Allah's Word is made superior (which means only Allah has the right to be worshiped), and Islam is propagated. By abandoning Jihad Islam is destroyed and Muslims fall into an inferior position; their honor is lost, their lands are stolen, their rule and authority vanish. Jihad is an obligatory duty in Islam on every Muslim. He who tries to escape from this duty, or does not fulfill this duty, dies as a hypocrite.\\"<br /><br />The passage itself can be found in two places. It is on page 39 of the Noble Qur'an translation by Muhammad Khan and distributed by \\"King Fahd Complex for the Printing of the Holy Qur'an-The Custodian of the Two Holy Mosques. It is a footnote to Qur'an 2.190 and is designed to explain Jihad according to Allah as this is the first time the word is used.<br /><br />And it can be found on page 580 of the Islamic University of Medina's translation of Sahih al-Bukhari's Hadith. There it opens Bukhari's Book of Jihad.<br /><br /> In both cases, the Islamic scholars are condensing Allah's and Muhammad's teachings on Jihad to a single paragraph.
B000089RV6|5.0|I remember when I was learning how to play rock guitar, this album was the one I was constantly jamming to to learn the art of bending and vibrato and the blues cliches and I owe these guys a great debt for that.<br /><br />Angus Young is still one of my favourite guitarists after all these years and if you ever wanted to know what Chuck Berry would sound had he been born 20 years later, this would be it.  Listen to all the great double-stop bending Angus does here and all without any guitar effects; just the amp distortion!<br /><br />With all the flash and on-stage persona and antics of the band, it's easy to overlook just how good this band is as a group of musicians in their own right as well.  Guitarists can tell you just how hard it is to play with great feel but Angus seems to do so effortlessly.<br /><br />Now with this remastered version, the tracks seem to have been given a new lease of life and with John \\"Mutt\\" Lange (Shania Twain's husband)the great producer behind the sound engineering of this album, the result is unsurprisingly a very good rock classic destined to stand the test of time.  Probably AC/DC's best ever album and one of my all-time favourites.
0156027321|4.0|This book is a little treasure, full of witty thoughts about religion, zoo-animals and surviving (fictionally) on a lifeboat. Please reread the last part over and over till all the pieces fall in place. It's worth the effort. To my opinion even the strange island can be explained. So what's bad about this book? There must be something. For example, it's quite a long read. But we want good books to be long. Secondly it's terribly unrealistic. A little boy and tiger being able to survive on a boat in the middle of an ocean. But ask yourself this when finished: what's the tiger? Things will become understandable in quite a harsh way. Some readers may be dissappointed though. It is after all a strange book. The storyline is pretty twisted at times.
B00005NGZX|5.0|When i first heard of this band, there was alot of hype. And like when any band has so much hype surrounding them, there is always doubts before hearing them. I recently bought this CD, my first of theirs, after deciding that it's time i truly gave them a chance. After listening to this album, i've been kicking myself for not getting into them any earlier. The intensity is just unbelievable. Musicianship is amazing. Riffs are brutal and relentless. The vocals underneath the chaos are just awesome, fitting the music perfectly i think. <br /> <br />Song after song after song on this album, just leaves you wanting more, more, more..especially (!) the last song, \\"Jane Doe\\". Going for at least 11 minutes, it is THE coolest (new..to me) song i have heard in a long time. It seems to stretch on for ages and ages, but you don't get restless while listening to it, instead you kinda..(well, i did)..get excited. Then the album finally finishes, the last song floating away into the distance and you're left going..\\"Like..Whoa\\". <br /> <br />As for my favorite tracks, i just can't pick a favorite really. Except for the final song, which is totally outstanding, every song is just as listenable as the previous one. Not one song on this CD i can skip, nor want to skip at all. It all makes for around 45 minutes of astonishing chaos. Converge remind me alot of bands like the Dillinger Escape Plan, Buried Inside, Black Dice and even Pig Destroyer to a lesser extent. Converge are just a punishingly brutal band, with total intensity and fantastic musicianship being some of their excellent trademarks. <br /> <br />One thing is for sure, when it comes to this band..Believe the Hype. Absolutely 5/5.
B0006L16N8|5.0|The first time that I heard X&Y I have to admit I was a bit disappointed.  I had waited patiently for its release and purchased it the first day it came out.  When I pressed play I was not immediately impressed.  \\"A Rush of Blood to the Head\\" was instantly engaging and while I knew that X&Y was a different album, it did not have that same effect.  I put it back onto the shelf and let it sit for a bit.  I even contemplated returning it for the new Oasis.  Needless to say, I did not and am very grateful for that decision.   <br /> <br />  Two weeks later while cleaning the house I decided to put on a bit of background music and opted for X&Y.  It lept out from the speakers in a way which startled me.  I had heard these songs before, but they had a profundity that I did not notice upon the first few listens.  The album ran its entirety and I played it again.  I have been playing the album about every day since and can honestly say that this is a wonderful album and my favorite in their catalogue.  Every single song is a gem, the melodies fascinating, and lyrics uplifting, inspiring, and thought provoking.  This is definitely a group operating at the top of their game.  Not since Pink Floyd's \\"Dark Side\\" have four people come together in a sonic marriage that appears to have divine help.  My proof is \\"What If\\".  Check how seamless the transition is from verse to first chorus.  The title track is like a midnight lover's dream, \\"Speed of Sound\\" is pure magic, and at the same time that \\"Low\\" exposes itself as the heart of the record, it signals the triumphant return of the greatest group on the planet.  Worth repeated listens.
B0009NSE1K|5.0|Bought this a few days ago and have yet to stop listening to it. I love basically ever minute of it. It's got blues, funk, and even country(Gravel Road) fused with some good hard rock/metal. It may not be like their previous albums(and who wants that anyway?) but it's still a damn good album in its own right. Highly recommended if you're a Clutch fan.
B0002VKZL6|5.0|After 25+ years of listening to Dire Straits and, then, Mark Knopfler's solo output, I am finally prepared to make a statement: <br /> <br />Dude is incapable of writing a bad song. <br /> <br />When so much of what passes for popular music is so resolutely UN-melodic, Knopfler continues to craft tunes that are beautiful, haunting, and nuanced. <br /> <br />\\"Shangri-la\\" doesn't teem with lavish production values (and guest artist appearances) like \\"Sailing to Philadelphia,\\" nor does it have the raw feel of several of the tracks on \\"The Ragpicker's Dream.\\"  But, by now we ought to know: if we expect a Mark Knopfler release to sound like the LAST Mark Knopfler release, we're doomed to disappointment.  The man is getting older, and his music is evolving. <br /> <br />If his guitar is less evident than it has been, his voice has never been more expressive.  And, if the current collection doesn't necessarily \\"rock,\\" it might be because he's writing about things that don't WANT to be addressed at high volume. <br /> <br />I was fortunate enough to catch Mark's show on the current tour, where he played a fabulous blend of the old and the new.  Here's a guy who brought us to tears with a lovely rendition of the title track from \\"Shangri-la\\"...but he still gets a kick out of belting out \\"Sultans of Swing.\\" <br /> <br />I can't wait to hear what he does next.
0553278398|4.0|In his later novels, ASimov attempted to tie together his Robot, Empire and Foundation series into a cohesive whole.  THis book is one of the main links in the chain.  In the Foundation books written previously, Seldon was a legendary figure revered by the people who owed him their existence.  In this story, the early adulthod of Seldon is revealed as he sets out on the path that will lead to his refinement of his psychohistory system.  Asimov brings in several recurring themes from his books to unite the works.  We see the legend of a mythical homeworld of humanity, the stories of robots and the myth of a unique long-lived robot dedicated to protecting humanity.  All are linked with Seldon in this masterful story.  He shows his ability to create a world of various cultures in Trantor.  I try to read the series every few years and each reading rewards with a new insight each time.
630460291X|1.0|This is one of the worst films I've ever seen.  Fans of the great Morgan Freeman or Alan Rickman may be tempted to buy or rent this film, but it is my duty to warn you to resist.  Morgan Freeman plays it straight and can't give a poor performance anyway, but we don't really care much about his character.  Alan Rickman, though, goes way past camp.  He's over the top without being entertaining.  But camp was a logical choice, given the unbelievably bad script. Rickman's associate is a witch, Morgana, and that whole storyline is jaw-droppingly bad. It's not even clear if it's supposed to be scary or funny or campy or what.  The witch seems to be popping in from some high school production of MacBeth and has nothing to do with the rest of the movie, which wants to be taken seriously.  Maybe Rickman's performance would have worked if the direction weren't so bad and the director had cut the film differently.  The worst thing about the film is Kevin Costner, who appears to be trying to win the award for worst performance of the 1990s.  He's got my vote.  I had no idea he was such a terrible actor. I had seen trailers of this movie and avoided it for years, but it's much worse than I even thought possible.  Some of the supporting players are appealing--Nick Brimble as Little John is good--but the acting is generally very bad.  The script is abyssmal, and, although the director can shoot arrows flying towards the camera, he manages to make it boring. If you enjoy Freeman's or Rickman's acting, try Amistad or The Shawshank Redemption with Freeman and Something the Lord Made or The Barchester Chronicles with Rickman.
0380789035|4.0|I bought this book, just by looking at it on a \\"Best Seller\\" display set.  I had never heard of it, nor of Neil Gaiman.  I bought it and began to read it, just by chance.<br /><br />I tell you, at first it was weird and just not my type of book.  By the end of the book, I wanted more and I was thrilled to have read this book.  The journey \\"Shadow\\" (the main character) goes through is quite awesome and well put together.  Everything in the story is just very well written.  The book only gets better with every page and just gives off this unique feeling as your eyes move along with the text.<br /><br />The Book is also divided into four parts, so I decided to judge like this.<br /><br />Part One - Decent<br /><br />Part Two - Good<br /><br />Parts Three & Four - AWESOME!!<br /><br />My overrall rating for American Gods is...<br /><br />8.6 out of 10
B00008S2VG|1.0|Chicken? how gross. This Manny cd has hardly hit Gold Status since its release in April 2003. If you're looking at US sales charts, where it counts, that's how poorly it fared.

0805079076|5.0|The author calls language an \\"uninvented invention\\". This very engaging book is an attempt to uncover at least some of the secrets of language and to dismantle the stated paradox. By drawing on recent discoveries in linguistics, Deutscher explores the elusive forces of creation, change and the innate structure of language. In addition, he investigates the way that the elaborate conventions of communication develop in human society. This cultural evolution means the emergence of behavioural codes that are passed on from generation to generation.<br /><br />Chapter One: Castles In The Air, takes a close look at the structure of language, whilst the following chapter: Perpetual Motion, demonstrates linguistic development and change with particular reference to English, German, French and the Indo-European language family as a whole. Chapter Three: Forces Of Destruction, is a further investigation of how and why changes in sound and meaning take place, with many examples from Indo-European. Chapter Four examines interesting verbs like \\"To have/to hold\\" and the concepts of space and time in linguistic expression.<br /><br />Chapter Five: Forces Of Creation, is a discussion of how new words and structures arise, how meanings change and how languages are enriched by these developments. Chapter Six looks at the need for order in languages and contains lots of interesting information on the Semitic family and its intricate verbal system. In essence, the effects of erosion interact with the mind's craving for order. There is thus a constant search for regular patterns and spontaneous analogical innovations arise. This is based on erosion + expressiveness and erosion + analogy.<br /><br />The final chapter brings it all together and includes detailed discussions of possessives, quantifiers, plural markers, articles and the various interactions of verbs and nouns. This highly entertaining read is accessible to the non-linguist and explains many fascinating features of language and its structure. There are five appendices, copious notes, a bibliography and glossary of terms. The book concludes with an index.<br /><br />I also recommend On The Origin Of Languages by Merritt Ruhlen, The Power of Babel by John McWhorter, How To Kill A Dragon by Calvert Watkins, and the work of that great pioneer of language classification, Professor Joseph Greenberg.here are five appendices, copious notes, a bibliography and glossary of terms.

B000002J1S|5.0|Gabriel's lyrics are bizarre, obscure and fascinating. This is one of the most obscurely twisted Christian musical works ever written; a story of the somewhat uncertain and difficult conversion of a street thug into a follower of the Lamb, almost despite himself. Riddled with New Testament allusions (just about everything from \\"broad way\\" to \\"lamb\\" ties in, using Gabriel's uncontrollable love of subtle puns and word-play), you get a peek (and not more) at Gabriel's own struggles and beliefs. This isn't the only time he's drawn from Christian sources - Solsbury Hill and Supper's Ready come to mind. <br /> <br />Gabriel mentioned \\"Pilgrim's Progress\\" as the template for the piece's story, and despite the hint, you can scarcely find a write-up anywhere that mentions the fundamentally religious essence of what's going on here. Apparently there weren't too many New Testament readers in the Progressive Rock scene... <br /> <br />Highly recommended mind trip. Play it in a dark room and prepared to be weirded.  <br /> <br />Production values could have been better (drums in particular are badly recorded), and the fact that Genesis loved to hack at the sounds of their instruments was given full play here: everything sounds other-worldy and hazy except the voices, and strangeness is tucked everywhere (listen for the subtle and annoying fly buzz underlying the opening at 0:16).  <br /> <br />\\"Something inside me has just begun... Lord knows what I have done...\\" <br />

B000008L90|5.0|`Cats without claws' was a continuation of Donna Summer's 80s experimentation. Produced by Michael Omartian, it was the follow up to the hit `She works hard for the money' also produced by Omartian.<br /><br />The album featured a diverse array of musical styles; Rock, Pop, R&B and gospel.<br /><br />The album made the US top 40 and the song `Forgive me' won Donna her second Grammy for best inspirational (Gospel) song. Not bad at all.<br /><br />Opening track `Supernatural love' is a rock/dance number which had a great video and features Summer belting out to a staccato of drums, heavy synths and lashings of vocoder.<br /><br />`It's not the way' is an energetic rock/R&B dance song featuring some of her most soulful vocals to date.<br /><br />The lead off single was the delicate syhthesized remake of the Drifter's hit `There goes my baby which made #21 in the US. Featuring Donna really pouring out her heart (really belting out) against a forlorn synthesizer backdrop, and mournful backing vocoder. Awesome! Also featuring a fab video available on `20th Century Masters - The Best of Donna Summer: The DVD Collection' (see my review).<br /><br />`Suzanna' is a slight Caribbean tinged number with a very precise delivery from Donna.<br /><br />Title track `Cats without claws' is a mysterious sound effect laden pop/rock number with very creative lyrics which I still can't fathom to date, LOL! Featuring excellent do wop-ish backing vocals to a rocking beat.<br /><br />My absolute favourite song is the brilliant `Oh Billy please', a rock/dance number. Very catchy and powerful vocals and fantastic guitar work. The dying minute features Donna's voice dueling with the guitars. Needs to be heard to be believed.<br /><br />Next up is the mid tempo psychedelic rocker `Eyes' featuring a lower register half spoken delivery from Donna against a shimmery guitar/synth backdrop. Another standout.<br /><br />`Maybe its over' is a beautiful ballad where Donna gets to really belt out about a romance which has come to a sad end. It sounds similar to her 70s Casablanca ballads. It was actually penned by Donna in the 70s for her backing group Sunshine (comprising her sisters).<br /><br />`I'm free' is yet another stellar performance. A semi calypso R&B number with excellent percussion, delicate echo-ey falsetto, and backing vocoder. With lyrics reflecting her Christianity. Excellent.<br /><br />Closing track is the gospel piano ballad `Forgive me', featuring a really passionate delivery from Donna.<br /><br />The CD artwork is also very colorful and arty, with Donna trying, in an abstract way, to portray the image of a cat.<br /><br />For those wondering if this brilliant album was ever issued on CD, yes it was.

B000002BSV|5.0|After the gloomy and sprawling sounds of \\"Dog Man Star\\", and the new addition of guitarist Richard Oakes and keyboardist Neil Codling, most were concerned on how the \\"new Suede\\" would fare without departed guitarist Bernard Butler.    When the first single, \\"Trash\\", hit the airwaves, all doubts went out through the window. Few bands have the ability to change their image and sounds as rapid and effectively as Suede can. Richard Oakes fills in nicely for Butler here with more simplistic, riff-based guitar work that contrasts nicely with Anderson's nasally vocals. Codling also help fills the band's sound with bubbly synths that keeps things flowing.    Featuring five top 10 singles and five other songs equally worthy of being singles, \\"Coming Up\\" is how mainstream records should be done. Normally I would give this album a 4 star because in respect to intelligence, this album is sleazy and dumb fun which was missing in the first two classic albums.     It gets 5 stars, however, because as a stand alone pop record, it pleases in every way. The up-tempo tracks like \\"Beautiful Ones\\", \\"Filmstar\\", \\"Starcrazy\\", and \\"Lazy\\" are all drenched in catchy guitar riffs, singalong choruses, and thumping bass lines that will have you dancing through it all.    \\"Coming Up\\" was the high that Suede needed to bring them the attention they deserved. Sure, \\"Starcrazy\\" and \\"The Chemistry Between Us\\" may not be lyrically thoughtful, but the music and tone help carry it.    To keep things organic, the bouncy numbers are matched with equally stunning ballads like \\"By the Sea\\", \\"Saturday Night\\" and \\"Picnic by the Motorway\\", that will continue to tug on your emotional strings just as the previous releases did.    Suede did what other Britpop bands failed to do in the mid-90's, and that is to keep the public guessing and the fanbase enthralled with releases that defied their presumed image.     To sum things up, if you like pop, there is a good amount of it here, and chances are this will be the perfect soundtrack to your emotional highs and lows.
B00004U8JV|5.0|Though I like all the Jurassic Park movies, this one is my favorite so far.
B0001MDPVS|5.0|This album just blows your mind...Its easily one of the best 3 rap albums ever realesed..My personal ranking is at 3 behind \\"Ready To Die\\" and \\"It takes a nation of millions to hold us back\\" but u can argue any of the 3 in any order..heres my review <br />1.Genesis 10/10 nice intro..I like how it leads into the 1st song <br /> <br />2.N.Y. State of Mind 10/10 This aint a billy joel song people.. this track will blow your mind lyrically he spits it all like its one verse..and the hook is all said twice and the lyrics change for that too <br /> <br />3. Life's a B**** 10/10 one of the best tracks on the album.. the only track with a guest..the hook is sick as hell and AZ and the piano loops make it sound amazing <br /> <br />4.The World is Yours 10/10 My favorite track on here..The hook is bangin..the beats crazy..one of the lines in this song was sampled in Jay-z's song \\"dead presidents\\" <br /> <br />5.Halftime 10/10 my favorite metaphor on this album= \\"with more kicks than a baby in a mother's stomach\\" <br /> <br />6.Memory Lane(sittin in da park) 9.5/10 its a masterpiece but it just feels a little depressing when u listen to it <br /> <br />7.One Love 9.5/10 this aint bob marley but Nas tears it up here <br /> <br />8.One time 4 your Mind 10/10 my second favorite track here..sooo gooood <br />9.Represent 9/10 again he tears it up <br />10.It ain't hard to tell 9.5/10 great way to end it <br /> <br />Again theres too many classics on this album to ignore it... easily one of the 3 best albums ever..its hip hop in its truest form w/o the bling bling and materialistic things on T.V. that give the genre a negative image..U know hip hop is an art form after listening to this..Its groundbreaking in a different way then \\"Ready To Die\\" or \\"It takes a nation of millions to hold us back\\" but its still original and does not dissapoint.. a masterpiece
B00003CXXS|4.0|Yes, this one is the worst of the three, but it is still very good!
6305633177|5.0|This DVD is one of the best collection of Metallica if you are truelly fan you will see the routs of Heavy Metal back in the eithys!!!!
B000089RVX|5.0|This is a must buy! My favorite song on it is, Going Under.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Linkin Park remains one of my favorite bands to mix rock and metal rap together. This album builds on the strengths of the previous one, and adds new factors to lift it a standard higher. <br /> <br />I particularly liked 'Numb' and 'Somewhere I belong.' The vocals and rapping go nicely together with the rockish and sometimes techno tune. 'Breaking the habit' was good, though it could use some of Shinoda's rapping. <br /> <br />But the main thing is, that the lyrics are all about negative things, such as giving up, or being rejected. It would benefit from some deeper lyrics, and perhaps a quieter, more melodious song. <br /> <br />Song music blend is fantastic 5/5, but is pulled down by the good but insufficient range of lyrics 3/5. Overall a good effort, and I do recommend it to rock fans
B00006879E|4.0|This CD is a must buy! I only dislike one song on it.
B00005IC2H|5.0|For me, this is an achievement, a mind-exploring and expanding emotional/musical achievement.  This album can take headaches away, make me feel whole, or make me want to cry, and in any combinations of those three.  I have no idea what they're saying, nor do I ever want to know for fear it will ruin my thoughts about the songs.  Listen to it while watching snow fall at night, it's amazing.
B00003CXAT|5.0|This is the one that started it all. If you haven't seen it yet, you are missing out!
B000069KE0|4.0|I was lucky enough to be driving a car with 5.1 channel sound, and felt curious to hear this. WOW! I can't comment about the CD, but in multichannel, the tunes just BREATHE with more room than I ever remember. John Kellog does a fabulous job making a wide but not hokey or fake sounding mix. I had to play \\"25 or 6 to 4\\" a half dozen times, I couldn't believe there was so much going on and it had so much punch to it. <br /> <br />As for the music, well, to me they all pale a bit compared to \\"Chicago Transit Authority\\" but this one I think will grow on me a lot.
0812550706|3.0|The reason to read this is because your teenage kids are reading it and they're enjoying the idea of children saving the world. Doesn't that pique your curiosity? That got me interested all by itself.  <br /> <br />Preposterous stuff; in a world of geniuses, the protagonist (pre-teen) is a hyper-standout beyond all comparison; we know him as a compassionate kid and a boy who just wants to play, but he kills more that once. As he wends his way through the \\"games\\" that he thinks will prepare him in case of an other-worldly attack from a species called Buggers, he is curiously slow to appreciate the machinations of the adults that are teeing him up for an intergalactic showdown.  <br /> <br />Meanwhile, back on earth, his siblings (teenagers) are virtually controlling all critical thought with opinion pieces that are contrived to stir the opposing viewpoints and personality types of the foolish adults who don't seem to challenge or understand this manipulation, but then they're such background characters you don't know for sure.  <br /> <br />Disbelief comes roaring back whenever I try to suspend it.  <br /> <br />But a sweetness emerges as they just still want to be kids, despite their genetically engineered superiority. Let's give this book a break; as intense as it is, it's essentially young adult fare.  <br /> <br />If it's stirring up real emotions in our kids, let's take heed. If in fact they are so willing to eat up a worldview where their age group is critical for the salvation of humankind, perhaps they're weary of being so short-shrifted in adult patronization through most of their school-age existence. Taking a look at that issue alone is worth the price of admission.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|Ok, i watched this movie for 45 minutes and i got so bored i tured on Dora the Explorer and watched benny the bull fall down a hill. (This is a show on a baby channal). My friends say i didn't understand the humor of this movie. They say it is so stupid it was funny. I think its so stupid...its stupid. I don't care if a guy wants a \\"quesidiilla\\" or if he rides on rollar skates on the back of a guys bike. I didn't feel the characters, and i couldn't connect with the character. How? Well, i have never tied a string to an action figure and thrown it out my bus window, or put tater tots in my pocket for later. This movie teaches nothing has no moral, makeds no sense, about as entertaining as a lightswitch, and seems as if the produces, script writers, and cienimatographers and the casting was all done by freakish German monkeys. DON'T BUY THIS MOVIE!!!! THE BOTTOM LINE:(drumroll) It stinks. (duh!)
0887306667|1.0|The writing in my opinion was poor. Way too much subject matter left out in book.
B00005A0N5|4.0|This CD IS really awesome. The metal parts blend perfectly with the operaitc style of vocals. This is the perfect CD to pop in after a stress full day or in my case night of work. I plan to buy all the other nightwish releases in the future. I would even see them in concert and for me that is saying a lot because I do not like crowds. Buy this it will help u relax.
B0009AM5JA|3.0|this was the 1st coldplay cd i ever purchased, just bought their other 2 cds for amazing price (9.49) each at futureshop.!=]  sadly, as much i hoped this cd to be outstanding, it was justtt OKAY. the 1st song i listened to obviously was fix you. i was already sick of speed of sound. and even that being the 1st release was just okay. nothing impressive, i still haven't managed to listen to the whole cd...<br />1) square one/ ehhh. it was good the first couple times<BR>2) what if/ ECK only listened to whole song once<BR>3) white shadows/ friend liked it but bleh for me<BR>4/ fix you. typical coldplay song . loved it but it didn't stick<BR>5/ talk/ BLEH!!!! <BR>6) x&amp;y/ didn't stick the first couple times but then still like it now<BR>7) speed of sound/ ...<BR>8)  a message/ 1st couple times nehh. but really like it now although i skip it after halfway<BR>9) low/ hmmm never finished it<BR>10) the hardest part/ BLEH!!<BR>11) swallowed in the sea/ good at first but now annoying<BR>12) twisted logic/ same as 11<BR>13) BEAUTIFUL BUT SINCE THEY DIDN'T REALLY WRITE IT CREDIT GOES ALL TO CASH. (written by johnny cash b4 he died)  but chris does do a nice job singing. <br />hmmm that's quite a lot of blehs and ehhh.  and has anyone else noticed how annoying it is that almost 70% of their songs on x&amp;y either start with a slowwwwww intro that sucks orrrr solo guitar with sorta talking/singing over...=annoying<br />OVERALL it was almost 2.75/5  chris' voice is still nice, songs are nice ballads, overall again: nice =[ and hey i wanted it to be good.  still their previous albums beat this one.  nonetheless you should buy this to SUPPORT THEM. WHO KNOWS MB THEIR NEXT ONE WILL AWE US ALL . but SERIOUSLY. WHAT IS UP WITH THE WEIRD LOOKING STICKERS OR TATS ON CHRIS'HAND???
B000053VAF|1.0|Not clever, not funny.  With the amount of talent in this movie, how could someone miss so badly?  This movie is aboslutely one of the worst I have ever seen.
B00068NVI4|3.0|I saw this 2004 tour twice (Ft. Laud. and MSG) and both shows were plaged by a weak and underpowered sound system.  Jon's voice was way louder than the rest of the instrumentation and the drums were barely audible most of the times.  And this DVD sounds the same.  There is a terrible imbalance in the sound mix.  When Jon sings I have to turn the audio down, and then turn it back up for the instrumental sections.  And you still can't barely hear drummer Alan White.  Most of the times the instruments sound tiny.  Even the much maligned House of Blues DVD had a BIG SOUND. <br /> <br />It is a good, but not great, show but it simply pales next to the Symphonic DVD.
B0007YBMA6|5.0|I picked this Korean version for $14.90(that was with the shipping) from another site. The quality is top notch. The movie is spoken in english and it plays just fine here in America. It's good to see Kong again in all his glory !

B00009V7RF|3.0|I know this album could have been iller than this, I mean, its the Black Eyed Peas! Some songs were undoubtedly good, but theres something missing about the songs. Weird..I dont what it is though. <br />I don't really like it, but if you do buy it you won't hate it either.
B000002JSP|5.0|This is a very good album. I can't understand why it is treated with so much disrespect. <br /> <br />In The Evening 10/10 this is a great rocker <br /> <br />South Bound Saurez 7/10 This is fun but not my favorite song on the album <br /> <br />Fool In The Rain 11/10 Calypso.

1573223026|5.0|Nick Hornby has proven himself to be adept at expressing the neuroses of adult males in ABOUT A BOY and HIGH FIDELITY, but he outdoes himself four times in A LONG WAY DOWN. Writing from four perspectives, Hornby makes convincing portraits of very different characters who bond awkwardly after a bizarre pre-suicidal encounter. <br /> <br />Even the female characters in this book are voiced expertly; Hornby proves that his understanding of women is better than that of his heroes. Though the story may sound, when summarized, like boilerplate light fiction, Hornby sprinkles it with sparkling details and his usual witty point of view. <br /> <br />I recommend this book highly to fans of Hornby's previous work, but there's plenty here for people who didn't like the subject matter of High Fidelity or the style of About A Boy. This is an accessible, enjoyable book.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I find this to be  beautiful !! I tell my granddaughter(3) we are listening to the voices of angels
B0009I7NNA|4.0|Lots of people are going on about how this album is the worst because there is no screaming and why isnt there any. Well the reason is M. Shadows popped a vein in his throat and the fact that he was still able to sing this good is pretty freaking amazing. The lyrics are still heavy, just because they aren't being screamed it doesnt make them any softer. If u listen to Thrashed and Scattered, or Bat Country there pretty crazy songs. Not to many people should complain about the screaming seeing that many people liked I Wont See You Tonight Pt. 1 the best on Waking the Fallen which had no screaming what so ever. Also vocals isnt the only thing people should be listening to, the music is pretty freaking amazing too. Unlike most metal(mixed with many other types of music) bands they put alot of effort into there music, the music in Sidewinder and The Wicked End is pretty crazy. Heres a list of ratings for the songs on this CD <br /> <br />1. Beast and the Harlot-9/10 - this is a pretty amazing song, the music to start it off and finish it is awesome and the lyrics are written about the name City of Evil <br /> <br />2. Burn it down-7/10 - not one of my favorites but a good song none the less. <br /> <br />3. Blinded in chains-7/10 <br /> <br />4. Bat country-9/10 - my fourth favorite on the CD. A awesome song with a heavy start, but two slow parts. One after the second chorus and one at the end. <br /> <br />5. Thrashed and Scattered-10/10 - my second favorite. The lyrics are probably some of the hardest on the entire CD and i think that it couldnt have been sung better... even with screaming. <br /> <br />6. Seize the day-9.5/10 - my third favorite. Every CD A7X has made has always had a slow song on it. For Sounding of the Seven Trumpets it was Warmness on the soul.Waking the fallen- I Wont See You Tonight Pt. 1, and Seize the Day is the slow song for City of Evil. Nice calm lyrics with soothing music to go with it. The most relaxing song on the CD. <br /> <br />7. Sidewinder-8/10 <br /> <br />8. The Wicked End-8/10 <br /> <br />9.Strength of the World-10/10 - This is my all-time favorite song on the CD. After listening to it about 3 times i loved it. it starts off pretty slow, nothing big, then about a minute in the music builds and the lyrics start. The lyrics are so dark and sad it makes me calm. <br /> <br />10. Betrayed-9/10 <br /> <br />11.  M.I.A-8/10 <br /> <br />I seriously suggest buying this album. It takes a while too get use to the lack of screaming after hearing Waking the Fallen and Sounding of the Seven Trumpets, but once you do you quickly grow attached to it
B000050FEN|5.0|There are just too many things needed to be said about Se7en.  It's one of my favorite movies of all time and will most likely remain there for a long, long time.  All the actors do marvelous jobs.  All the camera angles and lighting are fantastic, and bring an element of Film Noir (if you don't know what that film term is, then I suggest you look it up) to a film from 1995.  The originality and creativity displayed here is really what takes a hold of me personally.  For those who do not know what this movie is about I will sum it up with this: Se7en is about two Police Officers (Morgan Freeman and Brad Pitt) who probe the murders of a serial killer (Kevin Spacey) who chooses his victims based on the seven deadly sins.  There isn't a single flaw in this movie that I have noticed and believe me; I've watched this plenty of times.  There are no plot holes, no annoying things, no bad acting, and no rip-offs, nothing that brings this movie down.      People complain about the ending in that it is a bit of a downer.  I thought that too the first time I watched it, but afterwards I found myself drawn to the play button on my remote again and again.  Several people complain that this movie is too gruesome or of bad taste.  These people are ignorant and are clearly in denial of the darks spots of society that exist every day.  When you see this movie you realize that things like this happen, maybe not as intense as this, but they happen.  Bad things happen to good people.  We have Richard \\"The Night Stalker\\" Ramirez, Rape, Aids, Arson, Police Brutality, Cults, the Jonestown Massacre, etc. Listen, if you thought that this movie was too gory, then you seriously need to toughen up your stomach and sense of reality.  If anything this movie is not gory enough (it leaves a lot of it to your imagination, and you never actually see anybody killed).      There are gorehounds who complain that this movie wasn't gory enough.  If you want to complain about \\"sick people\\" then why don'tyou go and attack the film makers that bring us the great horror classics like \\"the Evil Dead\\" or \\"the Halloween movies or why not go so far as to attack \\"Dead Alive\\" (The Goriest Movie ever made, oddley enough it's a dark comedy directed by Peter Jackson).  Labeling Se7en as a sick movie only supports the idea that it is sick because you don't like it and choose to look away.  It is that very idea that the killer John Doe tried to point out that \\"we see a deadly sin on every street corner and we tolerate it, because it is common.\\"  I'm not sure if I have that quote exactly but it's the same overall message.  I could go further but I feel I have made my point.      This movie is disgustingly beautiful.  It's crude, but effective and there are just so many things about it that scream perfection.  Everything including the incredible opening credits scene with the disturbing Nine Inch Nails music (the song is called Closer (Precursor Remix)) is done to such a degree of perfection, that it is impossible to ignore.  The DVD box artwork is really cool to look at and on the second disc with the bonus features, we are shown that this one guy actually wrote out every single one of John Doe's journals and handmade it himself.  That is something you will not find happening behind the sets of most movies, rarely is that mush effort put into one.  And of course let's not forget the acting.  It's fabulous; Morgan Freeman only enforces his brilliance and his title as my favorite actor.  A movie like this only comes along once in a while, so therefore you must see this movie and if you like it, then go ahead and buy it.   It's understandable that this film is not for everyone, but hopefully it will open your eyes or pry them open.  Open way or another it may change you in some way, even if it's the smallest degree.  Well, hoped you found this review helpful and that you will enjoy this movie if you haven't already.
B00005JMXX|2.0|Okay, we've all heard about global warming by now, but this movie seriously blows it way out of proportion.  Realistically, ice ages take place over the course of several thousand years of gradual climate shifts, not in what? 9 days?  Please... This film will likely be seen as a great heralding warning to humanity by the enviromental kooks, a warning of a threat that is not at all even existant. But if you check REAL science at the door and put on your pseudo-scientific eyeglasses, the movie is good fun, and what a resemblance that vice president has to VP Cheney--gee golly whiz-I wonder what THAT was implying? These evil Bambi-killing conservatives--we're all out to get you! Anyhow, the real save for this movie is the majestic score.  Herald Kloser never fails to blow me away with his compositions. My advice is to buy the soundtrack, rent the movie.
0399103422|5.0|It took a week to read this book and I thought this was the best book I ever read.  I could'nt put the book down.  It does'nt matter if you saw the movie first.  There is so much story in the Godfather book, you will enjoy reading.   <br /> <br />Mario Puzo is a great writter.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves mafia movies more then me. <br /> <br />
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Stevens has several albums behind him, but this one is by far the most fully realized, accessible and interesting.  If you like this, you'll like his other work.  Stevens has been compared to Elliot Smith quite a bit, probably for his breathy singing style and the fact that he masterminds all aspects of his music.  Sufjan Stevens has a little more of an experimental side to him, though, and this album has a real cinematic feel.<br /><br />There are quite a few awesome choral choruses throughout the album you can hear some of them using the Amazon samples for tracks 9 (Chicago) and 16 (They are Night Zombies.)<br /><br />He also has a kooky sense of humor -- check out his song titles!  But this isn't Weird Al Yankovic humor, it's more like the TV show Northern Exposure in spirit.<br /><br />As an aside, I have to disagree with the reviewers who claim the song about Gacy makes you feel empathy for a serial killer.  I think it's actually Sufjan Stevens, with his delicate horrified voice, for whom you feel empathy.
0812550706|5.0|This book by Card really brings out the child in us all.  He weaves his story about a genius boy whose very birth was permitted only because he was expected to be a super weapon, and should have otherwise not have been born at all.  Everything that is expected from him is great, and he has lead nothing short of a deformed childhood. <br /> <br />In this book we get to watch as adult-level problems are placed upon the weight of children, either to show us how child-like we all can be or how genuine our feelings are, no matter what age. <br /> <br />Though sometimes the idea that these kids are hardly capable of such advanced thought at ages as young as 7 years old, I think that if you can overlook that one thing then you can enjoy this book to its outer limits. <br /> <br />The one beef I have with the way Card writes is that sometimes, to make a character seem smart, he makes them just 'know' what is happening or what is going to happen.  They see it coming a mile away and predict it and have perfect explanations and it just doesn't fit in with the rationale of reality sometimes.  Other than that, a near-perfect sci-fi book that has all the tell-tale signs of greatness.  Highly recommended, especially for younger readers.
B0000009RT|5.0|\\"We're Only In It For the Money\\" may be his best technically, but I find that the Zappa album I listen to the most is this one. Its strange how an artist with as many albums as Zappa produced a debut that is one of his greatest works. Every track is unique, and they all come together to form a concept, making this one of Rock's first concept albums (the first was Joe Meek's \\"I Hear A New World\\"), and this subsequently made Paul McCartney decided he wanted to make his \\"own 'Freak Out'\\" (\\"Sgt. Peppers\\"). And like all great concept albums, its tought to pick out a favorite because they are all part of a certain vision. There are social criticisms (\\"Hungry Freaks Daddy\\", \\"Trouble Every Day\\"), surrealism (the last three tracks), and pop songs (\\"Motherly Love\\", \\"Wowie Zowie\\"). Like every release by Zappa, the songs have an underlying sense of humor, making the pop songs more like parodies of pop song conventions. One of rock's best debuts, and a must-buy for fans of 60's music.
B00005JNTX|3.0|For two-thirds of its running time - the first half hour and the last half hour - this is great, revolutionary filmmaking, the ultimate film noir comic book come to life. But the whole thing judders to a dead stop when Clive Owen appears. I've no idea who he's sleeping with or who he's got the goods on, but it's obvious he hasn't got as far as he has on talent: the man simply cannot act to save his life. He looks bored, he sounds bored, and dammit, he IS bored throughout his section, dragging the movie down with his inertia and lack of talent. <br /> <br />But definitely buy this DVD. Why? Well, it could be because Mickey Rourke gives the performance of a lifetime in his section. Or it could be because Bruce Willis shows how even only one gear away from autopilot star quality can carry noir to the heights. But mostly it's because you can skip through Clive Owen's dead weight scenes and get to the good stuff in a way you couldn't in the cinema, leaving you with a great 70 minute movie instead of a compromised 100 minute one.  <br /> <br />66/100% proof!
B0002DB50E|5.0|This movie actually is just as disturbing today as it was in 1983. This film has rightly been called prophetic. The story centering around a sleazy cable programmer who stumbles across a snuff show called Videodrome who quickly becomes mesmerized by it and begins to lose his mind and hallucinate is very thought provoking stuff. We truly are an age obssessed by the media, so much so many of us can hardly tell where reality and fantasy break anymore. Television and video games draw us into alternate worlds and perhaps lodge into our sense of what is real more than we realize. Cronenberg is the king of true terror, he can get under your skin better than any filmmaker I can think of. The greatest visionary of our age, and a genius of the screen. The new flesh has come, go back in time and be reminded of the days when it had just been born with Videodrome. The Criterion Edition of this film is a very nice edition to any collection.
0060751967|5.0|I loved this book! And I'm betting it's the start of a new series. In fact, I demand that it be! The secondary charcters were so charming and well written that you couldn't help falling in love with them. <br /> <br />Roman is your typical alpha male bored, rich, playboy vampire. But like all vampires who are worth their cravable books, Roman has hidden depths and secrets from his past that way heavily upon him. In fact he was a human monk, a healer half a milllenium ago, who was kidnapped by evil vamps and transformed. He was tortured for years before breaking free and forming what is now an extremely powerful group of vampires, many of which he transformed. Because of his original vows to God, Roman takes the burden of his fellow vampires damned soles personal.  <br /> <br />These days he is a brilliant scientist. He developed synthetic blood for the benefits of his species and human kind. And he's on the verge of a formula that will allow him to stay awake during daylight.However, thanks to two of his slightly bumblesome but extremely lovable vampire employees he now finds one of his fangs stuck in a sex toy. If he doesn't get the tooth fixed before dawn. the wound will heal sans tooth and he'll be a lopsided eater and laughingstock for eternity. What he needs is an all night dentist... <br /> <br />Shanna's life is boring. well atleast it is now. Stuck in the witness protection program after witnessing a mafia hit gone bad, Shanna has no one and no life. But what little existance she has left is in jeopardy when one night at her dentistry practise the mafia decides to silence her for good. Lucky for her a sexy man carrying what looks like a wolf fang comes to carry her to safety.  <br /> <br />It's weird that he has a staff of Highlander security guards (were those really tartan covered coffins she saw them sleeping in?), a harem of woman in the parlor watching the DVN channel on the tv ( Digital Vampire Network - their joking right?), and the ability to have telepathic sex (yummy!) but whose complaning? <br /> <br />This book is a laughing rollercoaster of fun that will leave you craving more! Read it today! <br /> <br />
B00005OM4N|2.0|Britney Spears was very popular when I was a kid. My sister gave me her first 2 albums (which by the way were great!) They were fun, had good songs, and  good albums for a young girl. When I got this album I was to young to understand some things. Now I understand everything clearly. When I listen to this CD today, I think to myself \\"What kind of a song is BOYS?! That is  the most stupidest, weirdest song on her album!\\" Along with I'm a slave 4 u. Uh, get real, Britney. Those are inappropriate songs that I don't think kids parents would want them listening to. I know my parents aren't a fan of them. It's kinda like rap. It's not the best music  out there. Even though it's everywhere..you don't need to like it. So, you dont need to like Britney and some of her songs because it's not all that good. But if you like her, I don't care . Go ahead and buy her CD!
B0009SS00A|5.0|The plot is simple, yet exciting (thanks to the well formulated  series of technical backdrops). The reading is fast-paced. The computer (database/virus/NSA/virus filters/worms) descriptions are truly entertaining! Overall, I'am very satisfied with Digital Fortress; I'am looking forward to a fun-filled future reading Dan Brown's novels.
630438551X|1.0|I sat through fifteen minutes of this movie before I declared it one of the worst creations I had ever seen.  <br /> <br />At first, I thought maybe there was a twist... and that once we got through the gun fight of the first scene, it would get better. It didn't. By the time the second scene began, I was considering my own bottle of poison just to escape the possibility that this might go on. <br /> <br />This movie may be one of the worst I have ever had the misfortune to watch. If you plan to rent it, save your money. The movie on the shelf next to this one is better... guarenteed.
B000002BFZ|5.0|No Code is an absolutely amazing album.  A great departure from the heavier rock on their first three albums.  I'll just go over the songs themselves and what's good about them. <br /> <br />1. Sometimes - Great slow beginning, with awesome lyrics.  Works well as an opener for live shows, too. <br />2. Hail Hail - Awesome rocker.  Actually does really well without any real solo. <br />3. Who You Are - Fun, almost beachy kinda song.  The words are wonderful and upbeat.  The drum build up is great. <br />4. In My Tree - Great drum beat, which is lost in all of the 2003 bootleg recordings.  Mike's solo at the end comes through better when it's played live. <br />5. Smile - The harmonica totally fits this one.  Apparently Jeff and Stone switch guitars, but maybe they did that just that one time I heard Eddie mention it on a bootleg... <br />6. Off He Goes - Wonderful song about someone you love dying, and he goes away, until you want him back. <br />7. Habit - Severely underrated, the whole ending solo is great, and so is the little empty part in the middle with Eddie's one sentence. <br />8. Red Mosquito - Absolutely amazing slide guitar, all held down with a nice drum rhythym, and a trademark Stone Gossard riff. <br />9. Lukin - Great song about a drunk.  Or at least that's the message I get. <br />10. Present Tense - Some of the best lyrics ever.  Mike's fuzz box or phaser or whatever he uses sounds fantastic. <br />11. Mankind - Great almost pop punk kinda song, sung by Stone Gossard.  Only Stone could sing this one.  Eddie just would not sound right. <br />12. I'm Open - My least favorite on the album, though the words are good.  Too strange for me. <br />13. Around The Bend - Great closer.  Awesome little acoustic riff from Eddie, with some of the sweetest lyrics I think I've heard from them, besides maybe Bee Girl. <br /> <br />Great album, and never a bore to listen to.
B0002EXH5E|2.0|Killing is my Business throught Countdown to Extinction were great albums.  Even Youthanasia and Cryptic Writings had their great moments.   <br /> <br />But Risk??  What happened?  They went way too commercial with this album.   <br /> <br />I'm a Megadeth fan, but sorry Dave.  I hope you were right when you stated you had confrontations with the record labels and the band memebers because this album definately was a drop off from the past albums.
B00004T8RK|4.0|I'm not too sure why I don't hear or read too much good stuff about this album.  It is an absolute dynamo!  'Breakerfall' is a great beginning, with an exceptional song called 'Gods' Dice' following it.  Once you take the time to read them, you see that the lyrics for these two openers are absolutely amazing.  Next is 'Evacuation', Matt Cameron's first song for Pearl Jam, and it fits in very well, showing that he's here to stay.  The album then really slows down, almost too much, with 'Light Years', with good guitar contribution from Eddie, a great long solo called 'Nothing As It Seems', and a lyrical masterpiece from Stone Gossard called 'Thin Air'.  'Insignificance' sort of builds the album back up, though it is actually a downer song.  But I think the albums best ballad comes after this, 'Of The Girl'.  Matt Cameron's steady bass drum stays constant with the great little rhythym riff from Stone and a bluesy lead guitar played by Mike McCready.  All these lead the way for a great story told by Eddie that just happens to be a great song.  'Grievance' follows up, and it sounds a little more stripped down than when compared to the live recordings of Binaural's support tour.  'Rival' is a funky track with some strong vocals from Eddie, even if the lyrics aren't that great.  Next is one of the album's most downer tracks, 'Sleight of Hand'. This is a wonderful ballad that seems to tell the story of a cop or something that made a mistake and is forever changed.  'Soon Forget' is a great little fun track that really contrasts with the album's ending, 'Parting Ways', which starts off loudly and crescendoes well to end the album.  Until you realize that everything is still going and your song timer hits 6:50, where you get 28 seconds of Eddie tapping out a rhythym on his typewriter.  And that's the actual ending.  A great album, with a couple tracks that can be skipped when I'm not in the mood.  But the rest of them are absolute gems, and are wrongfully underappreciated.
B000002H97|2.0|This is where Metallica went commercial.  It's not the best, but not the worst.  This album gets 2 1/2 stars.   <br /> <br />I liked half of it.  It was a big change, but in some case it was a good change.  I did like Nothing Else Matters and I would dare say it was one of their best songs.  <br /> <br />I prefer the old school Metallica and I still laugh when people say this \\"was the first Metallica album\\".  It holds no candle to Ride the Lightning, Master of Puppets, & And Justice for All.   <br /> <br />I even prefer Kill them All over the Black album.  Anestasia-Pulling Teeth.  Need I say more?? <br /> <br />I will say that it's no worse than Load, Reload, and St. Anger.  I still scratch my head wondering what the hell happened when they put those three albums out.  I guess they're still making   layaway payments for their chin peircings, black fingernail polish and mascara.
1400032717|2.0|I have to admit that the book is very different. The funny illustrations throughout the book, and the story being told by an autistic boy. I was intrigued as to who killed the dog, but the answer was given away so quickly in the book.  After a few chapters, I find the endless mathematical problems, and the run-on sentences irritating. I find myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the interesting part.  I understand that what Christopher did is triamphant to autistic patients everywhere, but I really could care less.  Some intersting storylines, but oversall there's really nothing to the book.
B00003CXD5|5.0|I first saw this movie as teenager on broadcast TV - a long time ago.  Being a Bogart fan, I was all set for a classic, iconic performance. However, as Bogart's Fred C. Dobbs spiraled down into the depths of greed and despair, I wanted to look away - this wasn't the Bogie I knew and loved. But the story was so compelling, the acting so spot-on, the timing absolutely perfect that I stayed connected.  In the end, I was shaken and emotionally drained.  How many movies can you name that have that kind of emotional power?  Don't watch this movie if you are in a bad mood or even a little depressed. But if you love great films and great acting, grab this treasure for your collection.
B0009A1AS2|4.0|and I have been trying to decide what I thought about it ever since. <br /> <br />Let me start by highlighting the unique parts of the album.  I really liked ToT, but I was hoping (but not expecting) that they would get back to their early 90's metal (IAW-like) DT sound in this album.  Unfortunately, I think that era of DT has passed. <br /> <br />I would characterize the sound of the album as being a quite varied mix of sounds.  The first and seventh track have that distinct ToT \\"00's metal\\" sound, and both tracks are very good.  <br /> <br />The second track is the low-point of the album.  DT turns off the distortion and shoots for a sonically/lyrically inspiring tune.  Unfortunately, the lyrics are so shallow and bland that by the time it's all over you want to injure yourself to make sure that you can still feel.  The only thing cool about the song is rudess' use of acoustic piano. <br /> <br />The fourth track, some reviewers have noted, sounds like U2.  I have to be honest, the first time I heard the track that's exactly what I thought.  Now, before everyone attacks me, let me say one thing.  I don't believe that DT was trying to be U2.  The fact of the matter is this (and if you learn nothing else from my review, remember this): at some point with any band, people will inevitably classify an album(s) as that band's sound.  Once the band has distinguished itself with an 'original' composition, people want to believe that that composition IS the band.  When people think of the 'DT' sound, they think IAW and SFAM.  There is no doubt that various influences can be heard in the band's sound.  I was watching the Budokan dvd and my mom came in the room and said 'oh I almost thought you were watching a YES dvd'!?!  To be a realist, you must realize that ANY departure from what is accepted as the DT sound can be compared to another band.  That's just the facts.  There is entirely too much music out there to be entirely different from every band in every second of every song, and with all the talent in DT you can rest assured that they will not rest on what people want to believe is 'their sound'.  I also believe that DT fans would stop listening if they sounded the same on every album.  So if someone says 'hey this track kinda sounds like U2,' be happy because it means that DT is still trying to innovate.  Furthermore, if several people all had the same initial reaction to the song, maybe there's something to it.  Frankly, I think that Petrucci sounds very U2 edge-esque on track 4. <br /> <br />On to the epic... <br />The last track (the title track) is 24 minutes long.  Obviously, DT had to draw a little on MP's experience in Transatlantic.  One reviewer noted the concluding lyrical refrences to the opening track, and for that I award some points; however, I typically pay more attention to instrumentals and would like to give attention there.  The start of the epic is very nice with spacy keyboards that drop off into a very cool flute solo.  Then about 5 minutes in, the guitar starts a darker, gentler progression as labrie enters relaxedly with vocals making every effort to hit the 'odd note'.  At 8 minutes, the song picks up a little into a what seems to be an actual melody, but still digresses every now and then out of direction.  And just as you think they are getting to a melody in from behind comes the jazz note and throws everything off.  Then at 12 minutes rudess comes in with some awesome IQ/ Tony Banks Genesis keyboards.  The song straightens out at 13 or 14 minutes with some truly melodic sections of heavier instrumentals, leads, vocals and backups.  A really cool instrumental section comes up next with some sweet guitar riffs again drawing on some newer IQ-like sounds around 18:15.  Unfortunately, altough the instrumentals are really interesting and enjoyable, they don't push the direction of the song, and only at 20 minutes is the true sense of the epic realized. <br /> <br />Now, I have listened to progressive rockand metal extensively and have owned this album since the day it came out.  I have probably heard this track over 30 times by now and yet I still can't find any continuity from one part of the song to the next.  The epic seems to explore new territory all the way through, and while the music is really really cool, 20 minutes of music do any justice to driving home the climax of the song at the end. For that reason, I have to give this album a 4 (and because track 2 is almost unbearable). <br /> <br />If are new to the epic track, I recommend buying IQ's newest album Dark matter (btw for those of you who listen to metal exclusively dont buy it -- it's definitely not metal).  They do a breath-taking job putting together an epic track. <br /> <br />Sorry I couldn't give a 5.  For those of you considering purchasing the album, keep in mind that I still did listen through the album over 30 times in about 2 months!  It's worth every penny so go ahead and get it.  I will definitely buy their next album when it comes out because these guys probably have more talent than any other band out there right now.
B0000024ZI|5.0|It's a mystery as to why Mott the Hoople had such a hard time breaking through in the music industry before \\"All the Young Dudes,\\" especially considering they had albums such as their eponymous debut and the hard driving \\"Brain Capers.\\" Nevertheless, it's easy to see why this particular album DID finally break them through. It's a glam rock (and perhaps even 70's in general) classic. <br /> <br />The opening cover \\"Sweet Jane\\" is pretty basic, not straying too far from the original Lou Reed composition (probably because he was in the studio working with them, and he and Ian Hunter did not get along).  <br /> <br />It's followed up with one of the most unique sounding rock songs of the 70's, \\"Momma's Little Jewel\\". With Mick Ralph's driving guitar, Ian Hunter's sneering vocals and witty lyrics it defined the sound that Mott the Hoople would become famous for. <br /> <br />Next is the Bowie penned \\"All the Young Dudes,\\" the homosexual ballad that made them famous, and for good reason. It's melodic, it's often campy, it deals with controversial issues: it's a perfect glam rock gem, and the band pulled it off perfectly. <br /> <br />\\"Sucker\\" is another unique Mott the Hoople gem that's one of my personal favorites. Hunter's witty, sarcastic lyrics are complimented by an unusual beat and a crunchy guitar. The guitar solo near the middle adds power and fills a gap in the music that wouldn't have been filled otherwise. <br /> <br />\\"Jerkin' Crocus\\" (another one of my favorites) is a straight ahead rocker, but with Hunter's signature sarcastic lyrics and sneering vocals. Even with their latter efforts in \\"Mott\\" this stands as one of the best rockers they recorded.  <br /> <br />\\"One of the Boys\\" is another hard rocker, but doesn't quite sit as well as \\"Jerkin' Crocus.\\" It's probably because the last half of the song is plagued by some ear wrenching screaming from Hunter. It adds nothing to the song, and actually almost makes that half unlistenable. The first half, however,is great hard rock in the vein of Bad Company. <br /> <br />\\"Soft Ground\\" is a pulsing hard rock masterpiece, but is surprisingly not penned by either Hunter or Ralphs, but rather the organist Verden Allen. The vocals are intentionally exaggerated and the organ is loud and rolling. It's sad, after hearing this number, that they didn't use Mr. Allen more often. <br /> <br />That brings us to \\"Ready for Love/After Lights\\" a song that Mick Ralphs later used for his 70's arena rock group Bad Company. I can honestly (and happily) say that the original is better than the one Bad Company did. It's faster, more raw, and Mick Ralphs vocals don't sound entirely safe, giving it an edge the Bad Company version couldn't obtain with Paul Rodger's as the singer. \\"After Lights\\" also stands as one of the best guitar solos Mick Ralphs has recorded. <br /> <br />And finally \\"Sea Diver\\" crawls by with intense feeling and some well used orchestration. Hunter has always been good at creating slow ballads of deep meaning and signifigance, and this one is no different. It does it's job by ending the album on an emotional high note, compelling people to listen to the album again. <br /> <br />What makes this album unique is all the feeling that went into every one of the songs; the same feeling that is eventually spit back out at the listener when he/she hears them. Mott the Hoople has always been brilliant. This album just made people aware of it.
B000001Y2U|1.0|Marilyn Manson. The name brings many images and many things to many minds. This album came out when I was in grade 7. I remember everyone I hung out with being totally in love with this album. I myself listened to it on a very constant basis.  <br />But that was then. My views have changed in many ways since.  <br />'Antichrist Superstar' is no longer an album with anything to offer me. I am a fan of Nine Inch Nails, I think Trent Reznor is the most ingenius man in music right now. I'm sure he had more than to do with this album than anyone wants to admit.  <br />In the years since grade 7, I have become a born-again Christian. I like to think I keep a pretty open mind about things. I don't dismiss music, movies, books, or television, just because it isn't Christian and don't judge anyone based on their lifestyle or the things they listen to. To be honest, I don't think MM is a satanist at all. I never have. I think it was a way for him to sell his image. A character he became in public to shock people into buying his crap. Regardless of how much of the lyrics on this album are real or not, they're still sick, twisted garbage. Whether it was his intention or not, Manson is playing with fire here. Songs like The Refecting God, Wormboy and a handful of others are an invitation to satan to enter the soul and the home. This album may be an industrial music masterpiece, but keep in mind that whenever you listen to this disc, demons are dancing all around you.
B00003CXE7|5.0|Short and simple: this movie is brilliant.  Russell Crowe's flashbacks in the film are especially beautiful and touching.  Overall, the entire movie is extremely well done.  Definitely a must-have.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|I have to give System Of A Down credit. They're doing exactly what they wanna do and making the same music they were almost 10 years ago. Any band that finds itself amassed in sudden popularity and dosen't buckle to the pressures of a major label shaping their sound to fit a certain 'radio-friendly' mould, deserves credit.   I have listened to every SOAD album and have, for the most part, enjoyed them. Although I wouldn't call their albums masterpieces by any means, they are well done and the vocal work certainly gives the band an original sound.   This album is a step up and a step down from their previous releases. Fistly, the music and musicianship, is superb. These are definatly guys who know how to play their instruments and play them well. However, the vocals are so erratic I found myself beginning to feel annoyed at them. I think on this album, they might've gone a little over-the-top with them.  What System also does well with here is the quiet-loud verse, chorus, verse dynamic that was made popular in the early 90's by Nirvana. Actually they take that formula to such an exteme, its almost funny.   I gave this album 3 stars, 1 for vocals, 2 for music.  Standout tracks: Violent Pornography, Old School Hollywood
0895260131|5.0|This is a book that certainly changes our misconceptions regarding history, and how things are connected. Although it is something that people are not used to hearing, it is a must read, and has evidence to back up its claim.
B00025ETIW|5.0|Like most people, the first song i heard was Im Not Okay(I promise), and i loved it.  Finally, i decided to pick up the album, and was amazed by it.

B0007P3582|3.0|Several of the songs on this album are much better than his first album, but not all of them, some of them out right suck, still better than JA.
B000001DTM|5.0|Admittedly, U2's older stuff is still classic, and untouchable. However, this particular album has some of their best stuff, ever. Not much more to say about it.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|These CDs are great.  I think the Foo Fighters are awesome.   <br /> <br />I must say I'm ticked about the inability to put the music on my Ipod like others.  I don't have a CD burner, so I can't make a copy of my CD.  I think it's wild that you have to do this to get around the issue.  If people have this extra copy of the CD they had to make, I think they're more likely to just give the copy to a friend.
B000055Y0X|2.0|This movie is lame.  There isn't one good laugh in it.  It is tiresome.  The only good thing about it is that it warns us against right wing lunatics who might start a nuclear war because they are crazy.  Fine.  It is politically correct.  But that doesn't mean that the movie is any good, and it isn't.  I have hated almost every Stanley Kubrick film I have ever seen.  His work is terrible.  The best of the sorry lot is Barry Lyndon, which is too long, too slow paced, has no characters who aren't annoying and despicable, but is worth three stars, which is more than I can say for the rest of his garbage.
B00006JOBC|5.0|Parachutes has a distinct sound that can only come from coldplay.  The sound producer did an excellent job, as he also did on A Rush of Blood to the Head (which why I'm sad that coldplay parted ways with him during the recording of X&Y).  I have been playing music for almost my whole life and the rhythm section (Will and Guy) does an awesome job of getting everybody on the same page without oversimplifying their sound.  They are the ones that really set the stage with compound rhythms.  Jonny and Chris's expertise are showcased in all of these songs, which are more acoustically whole than I thought a band could make.  If you are a new fan to coldplay, then take this album for what it is.  It doesn't have the simple poppy beats and lyrics of their current lineup (which is still pretty good).  Every band goes thru phases during their tenure and Parachutes was made when ALL members of the band were in snyc and worked towards a balanced sound.  This album is a masterpiece and will always be the best album to introduce new listeners to coldplay.
B000002H6C|5.0|Ok, Cliff isnt on bass but this album kicks some major butt with Newstead. The whole cd is heavy, fast, talented, and well produced and recorded (no fuzz like Kill em all here.) The lyrics are well thought of and kirks solos are outstanding. Metallica scored huge with this one!! Here's a review on the songs:<br /><br />Blackened: An awesome song with a catchy chorus and the only one that Jason helped with. Out of 10 it probably deserves a 9.8.<br /><br />...And justice for All: The title song and very long I might add (9.44) The intro is awesome and the solos are sweet, but I will admit that it gets repetitive. Still makes a great song!(10)<br /><br />Eye of the Beholder: This is a sweet song! Not to long not to short. It has great lyrics and it makes you think alot! I love how James' voice is morphed in the verses. (9.7)<br /><br />One: A hit single with power, drive, and an excellent intro. It is one of Metallica's best slower songs and never gets old! (10)<br /><br />Shortest Straw: This song is pretty cool too! James really growls those lyrics out on this one! A little repetitive but then again it clocks in 3 minutes before justice!  This one gets a 9!<br /><br />Harvest of Sorrow: A greastest hit I beleive and well deserved. The way it goes from hard pounding to a quiet rythem and then back steadily (with the drums leading the way) to heavy is very sweet! It is not close to being repetitive and has sweet solos. (10)<br /><br />The Frayed Ends of Sanity: Ohh-ee-ohh ohhhh! That is how the song starts and it only gets better! It sounds like a Lord of the Rings chant at the beginning then turns into pounding, driving lyrics and music. A great sports anthem! (9.5)<br /><br />To Live is To Die: Though this song has only one paragraph of words and clocks in at 9.48 it is a great \\"instrumental\\" and is powerful for the true metallca because it is one of Cliff's songs. Thats right, metallica put it in their cd in memory of Cliff. Very Cool. (9)<br /><br />Dyers Eve: MY FAVORITE FREAKIN SONG ON THE WHOLE CD! This song was put on last because it is the best. At 5.12 this ode to children being treated like crap by their parents is heavy, pounding, driving, talented, and any other words that describe Metallica. The solo is amazing and one of my favorites done by Metallica. (12)<br /><br />Hoped you liked my review even tough it was long. I hope it helps in your desision with buying this great cd./>Dyers Eve: MY FAVORITE FREAKIN SONG ON THE WHOLE CD! This song was put on last because it is the best.

0060263857|5.0|My 4 yr old daughter absolutely adored this book.  It began as a story read at bedtime, but after the second chapter my daughter begged to have it read at breakfast, in the afternoon and after dinner!  It was a fast and easy read with plenty of opportunity to discuss the principle themes of friendship, love, loyalty, and the 'circle of life'.  Enjoy!
0792844890|5.0|Yes, you heard the title. This movie has so many funny lines, it's impossible to say them all! (Unless you've seen this movie 15 times, like I have.) <br /> <br />Basically, this movie is a spoof off of mostly Star Wars and Star Trek. If I were to compare the characters from Star Wars with the characters from Spaceballs, it would be something like this: <br /> <br />Lone Star = A mix of Han Solo and Luke Skywalker <br />Princess Vespa = Princess Leia <br />Barf = Uhh...R2D2? That's the closest thing I can think of, there is no dog...err...mog (half man, half dog) in Star Wars. <br />Dot = C3PO <br />Dark Helmet = Darth Vader <br />Yogurt = Yoda <br />Pizza the Hutt = Jabba the Hutt (Pizza's really gross looking, I sometimes fastforward the part that's he's in.) <br /> <br />Anyway, what this movie is about.  <br /> <br />Princess Vespa comes from the planet Druidia, and she is forced to marry Prince Valium, being a princess, she can only marry a prince, and this guy is the last prince on the planet. He's a really boring, sleepy kind of prince, too. So, Princess Vespa drives away in her expensive space car thing, with her robot, Dot, to outer space, to run away from it all. <br /> <br />Little does she know she is being kidnapped by Dark Helmet and his minions. He plans to kidnap her, in order to destroy Druidia. Planet Spaceball is running out of oxygen, so Dark Helmet plans to kidnap Princess Vespa, and either give her a hidious nose job and save the air on Druidia, or leave her nose the way it is, and suck all the air from Druidia, and ship it to planet Spaceball. <br /> <br />Luckily, that's where heroes come in. King Roland, father of Vespa, has asked Lone Star and Barf, his sidekick, to find Princess Vespa, and then he will pay him 1,000,000 spacebucks. Which is what Lonestar and Barf need to pay off their debt to Pizza the Hutt, the gross looking guy. Who dies later. Yay. <br /> <br />So, in order not to spoil the rest of the movie, I'll just say that it is really, really funny, and there are funny lines being said every 20 seconds. You'll love it.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|I can't wait for this DVD to come out! I'm especially looking forward to the alternate ending called \\"Brock's Epiphany.\\" There will also be 29 deleted scenes, a new making-of documentary, commentaries by director James Cameron, Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart, and producer Jon Landau and executive producer Rae Sanchini, as well as the music video of \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" by Celine Dion. There's also more special features, and, not to mention, the academy-award-winning masterpiece in a new better-than-ever DVD format. I can't wait!!
B000003TA4|1.0|Idolize the collective middle finger all music lovers with good taste are giving you right now, kid. You'll see it a lot more frequently since you like to tout Cobain the voice of a \\"needy\\" generation looking for someone to latch onto. In reality, he spoke for a generation that could speak for themselves. And what did we say? Well, it was a resounding \\"Fu*ck You\\". He acted like he had the same problems as us, but he was just a multi-millionaire exploiting the 'homeless teen runaway' image. He was the Crowned Prince of Grunge in pauper's clothing (literally). He was a total fake. Kurt Cobain profited off the misery of millions of teens. For the REAL Nirvana, listen to (but for the love of God, do not buy) With the Lights Out. It's the most laughable excuse for music I've ever heard. Better yet, watch the footage of Kurt singing to a wall in a basement! Funny stuff. Afterwards, fans will realize they were worshipping a false idol. And for the non-fans, well, it just solidifies what we already knew; that Cobain was nothing worth admiring.

Garth Nix opens a world to readers of all ages, he creates characters that we love, a quest for a loved one, and a hope that everything has an almost happy ending.  But this is only the first book, the first tale, and Garth Nix has many tricks up his sleeve to captivate readers and drag them, whether they like it or not, into a world they will never forget.

B0009VCSXW|5.0|\\"Sin City\\" is a black and white world, except when the blood is being sprayed around and then be prepared for lots of red or white or even yellow. Based on three of the first four \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels by Frank Miller (\\"The Hard Good-Bye,\\" \\"The Big Fat Kill,\\" and \\"That Yellow Bastard\\") and \\"The Customer Is Always Right\\" short-story from \\"Babe Wore Red\\" that was the test run for this project, this 2005 film sets the standard for what film noir will be in the 21st century and advances the cause of digital filmmaker even more than \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow.\\" That film was pure eye candy, but \\"Sin City\\" is much too gritty to be that sweet. You are going to wince at some of what happens in this film and you might even turn away once or twice as the over the top violence hits you in the gut as hard as it hits some of the characters in the side of the head. But chances are you are going to love this movie to death.<br /><br />Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" is a world where the heroes can take a whole series of punches as well as deliver them, where justice has nothing to do with either mercy or the cops, and the system is crooked from top down to pretty near the bottom of the barrel. The dames are still worth dying for and some of them might even be goddesses, but others can defend themselves quite well, thank you. This is a world where protecting women is hard-wired into the psyches of guys like John Hartigan (Bruce Willis), Marv (Mickey Rourke), and Dwight (Clive Owen). If you fail to protect a dame, then somebody has to pay and in a way that will make the scum bucket think Hell is heaven when you finally let them go there. This movie is rated R for sustained strong stylized violence, nudity and sexual content including dialogue, but that is an R that is a lot closer to NC-17 than it is to PG-13.<br /><br />Ang Lee tried to have parts of \\"The Hulk\\" look like a comic book, but that meant throwing several frames on the screen at the same time. But with \\"Sin City\\" director Robert Rodriguez knows that a comic book panel can be like a frame in a motion picture and visa-versa, so his solution was to embrace Miller's visual style and make him the co-director of the film (and give him a small role as a priest hearing his final confession). The \\"Sin City\\" were done largely in black and white, although sometimes white and black, and other times when the strategic addition of a single color as in the red of a woman's lips, the yellow of her hair, or the blue of her eyes. Sometimes the red is a cool looking car.<br /><br />This is the bloodiest film noir of my experience, so it is a good thing that when there is a lot of blood is it just as likely to appear as bright white or neon yellow as globs of the red stuff. But it is also evokes more bursts of laughter at the audacious violence and the perfectly timed one-liners, most of which will never work uttered in Dirty Harry fashion out of the context of the film. This is film noir in the tradition of Mickey Spillane updated for the Quentin Tarantino generation.<br /><br />The standout performance in \\"Sin City\\" is clearly Mickey Rourke as Marv, who is buried under so much makeup you keep assuring yourself that he is really in there somewhere. In keeping with the formula of the film Marv is both the most violent of the protagonists, giving taking somebody for a ride a whole new meaning, and the funniest, in both word and deed. Willis and Owen are both fine as the other two protagonists, but they are more the strong and silent types, neither as reflective nor as sardonic as Marv. Willis definitely has the world weary act honed down to perfection, but Owen seems a bit too mannered in his detachment in his story line and ends up finishing third in the hero sweepstakes. Elijah Wood as Kevin does not get to speak but still creeps you out as Frodo gone over to the Dark Side. Benicio Del Toro shows some nice comic timing as Jack Rafferty and Michael Madsen has not changed a bit as Bob, whileNick Stahl is scum of two different colors. Rutger Hauer, Powers Booth and Michael Clarke Duncan all take turns playing heavies and it becomes pretty clear Rodriguez could get just about anybody he wanted to do this movie.<br /><br />Of the women of \\"Sin City\\" it is Devon Aoki as Miho who stands out although she never says a word (she does not have to). Jessica Alba's best moments as Nancy are silent, although there is a change in why that is the case as we go through the movie. Rosario Dawson has fun going over the top as Gail, Brittany Murphy goes slumming as Shellie, and Jaime King plays two sides of the same coin as Goldie and Wendy. Alexis Bledel is certainly trying to get as far away from Rory Gilmore as possible by playing Becky, but I am afraid she does not get far in that regard. Then again, if you have read Miller's graphic novels you will be impressed by how Rodriguez has brought the stark black and white images of Becky, Hartigan, the Yellow Bastard and the rest of them to life on the screen. This movie is going to make a ton of money, Miller is going to sell a lot of copies of the new editions of his \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels, and hopefully it will not be too long before we get the next cinematic installment, which should have Johnny Depp playing Wallace in the \\"To Hell and Back\\" segment.Bob, while Nick Stahl is scum of two different colors.

0618526412|4.0|Sixtyfive years after its publication, Carson McCullers' first novel clearly deserves the label of classic literature.  The Heart is a Lonely Hunter is primarily a novel of voice and characterization, and Ms. McCullers demonstrates virtuosity and originality in both.  The ensemble of characters is amazingly diverse, with no hint of stereotyping.  The evocation of southern life in the thirties is convincing and surprisingly insightful.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the book fails to achieve its goal of portraying the tragic gulf that separates people who need each other.  It fails because Ms. McCullers' characters don't speak to themselves.  They act, react, feel, and struggle.  But we are left with the impression that the town is inhabited by idiots savant who (with the exception of a listless restaurant owner whose observations pile up like a stack of old newspapers) are incapable of reflecting on their own thoughts and feelings.  It is obvious that people who won't try to know themselves cannot expect to be recognized by others.  Thus the characters' various failures are not tragic, but merely pathetic.
B00006JL1Z|3.0|The term \\"very best of\\" is often misused in the record industry.  It is someone's opinion, and in this case, Warner Bros.  This compilation includes most of their impressive works but wastes valuable space with fillers such as \\"Family Man\\", and the live \\"Big Love\\".  In UK and Australia, a single disc edition has been released which also features three of the original Fleetwood Mac songs (Man of the world, Albatross and Black Magic Woman) - these are welcome additions and demonstrate an important part of the history of the band well before Nicks and Buckingham came on board.  There are a few fillers even on the single disc which could have been better used for classics such as \\"Silver Springs\\" and \\"Hold Me\\" (these two appear on the 2-disc edition).    What I do like about both compilations is the inclusion of the radio edits of \\"Rhiannon\\" and \\"Over my head\\".  These were previously hard to find, and I must say I prefer these versions.  I have the album versions already so this is a real bonus to me. I would have liked to see the radio edit of \\"Say you love me\\" thrown in too, but I guess Rhino couldn't get their hands on it.    Overall summary:  I would recommend users importing the single disc edition which is a fine collection (although like the 2-disc version, not perfect).  As always, listeners owe it to themselves to check out the original source material ie. the studio albums (Rumours, Mirage, Fleetwood Mac and to a lesser extent \\"Tango in the night\\").
B00005JMJ4|5.0|So, if you are one of those sheep that enjoys the mindless crappola that comes out every summer, you will not get it. <br />Actually, a lot of people don't get it, because they don't understand a movie about people.   <br />They don't get anything that is character driven, or at the least, don't get characters that are not bigger than life good guys or bad guys. <br />Maybe one has to have been at a point in life at some time feeling out of place, lost, looking for something and not sure what, to be able to understand this. <br />Unfortunately, so many mindless sheep go through their lives in a consumerist haze of job, mall, couch, tanning salon, repeat, that they don't even know they are wandering aimlessly.   <br />The 21 inch rims they bought made their year.
B00003CXB4|2.0|There is no denying that money can buy craftsmanship. The Lion King contains some of the most beautiful animation ever seen on the big screen. From the single aspect of making animated drawings, there are some lovely things to watch in this film. Until you get to the lions' faces. Most recent Disney films are done in the style of past Disney films, as if the corporation decided to hedge their bets--'we'll do it like we did it back then, because we know it worked'. The Lion King's character designs are based on Disney's Jungle Book, which had some of the most un-cat-like cat faces ever drawn. So, after all the talk about realism in the making of this movie, I just cannot get into the way the characters look. There seems to be a touch of \\"Cabaret\\"-style makeup on their faces, and I have avoided seeing \\"Cabaret\\" because the makeup style creeps me out. <br /> <br />So, is there a good story to save this film? Ummmm.... no. Oh, I know things happen, but why do they happen? How does Simba manage the turnaround that allows him to save the day? There is no character development for the main character of this movie! <br /> <br />In typical Disney fashion, we get more insight into the villain's character. The villain also gets plenty of juicy screen time, and gets the most intense images, both in his character design (greater contrast in the visual elements = greater impact) and in his environment and supporting characters. This movie is really about evil, and how powerful evil is. Simba's overthrow of the evil elements is confusing and inexplicable in the universe of this movie. <br /> <br />No wonder I hear so many reports of small children waking up screaming in the middle of the night after watching The Lion King. <br /> <br />I will always consider The Lion King as a must-to-avoid when it comes to picking a movie to show to children. For someone old enough to view it as an example of high craftsmanship in the physical art of animation, it is fine. As entertainment... no,there is no merit in the storytelling in this film. <br /> <br />As is all the rage of late, the movie on this DVD has been altered in several places from its original theatrical version. Why? Don't ask me.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This Cd is absolutely Brilliant...Brilliantly produced, intelligently sung and written. Mariah's spectacular voice makes Madonna sound as if she's still struggling to win a place in an amateur talent contest. <br />Live Aid was Mariah's show along with McCartney and U2. <br />She proved the skeptics wrong and has had the #1 song for 8 weeks straight on Billboard. This album will garner a string of Grammy award noms for next year.  <br />I'm also a big Cyndi L. fan. And hope that the fun girl will have a huge successful comeback, ala Mariah, with her new cd come this October.  <br /> <br />
1401201911|5.0|Overall, I liked this graphic novel. In did seem odd to me, however, that, not just Superman, but none of America's superheroes came to being without Luthor's help. An earlier reader was correct in his assessment that the entire DC Universe in rewritten in this story. But it seems to fit this dark and moody story that seemingly without Superman, America's heroes ceased to come into being. I do, however, think the story accurately portrayed the dark feeling of the Cold War. I also like the depiction of Josef Stalin. Pick up this graphic novel for the complexity of the story, Stalin, the ingenious use of \\"grey areas\\", and the shocking secret revealed at the end!
B0001XALTG|5.0|Being too young to have seen this when it first came out, I was able to watch it on a cable channel that did not feel the need to edit anything.<br />Let me say this: Trainspotting is most definitely not for everyone. It's entertaining on a sick level, and, of course, Ewan McGreggor fans might be somewhat surprised at what the cheeky-grinned Scot is up to, but for those who can take it, Trainspotting is very, very good.<br />The thick Scottish accents, and the British slang may have been thick to cut through a decade ago, but in our world of Harry Potter, Bridget Jones and Austin Powers, if you don't know what &quot;football&quot; &quot;Jumper&quot; and &quot;wanker&quot; mean, you've been hiding under a rock.<br />The movie at its base is not about the herion addiction around which the story takes place, but about friendship, and more often than not, the lack thereof.
B000AP04FG|5.0|Personally I like dark comedies.  Up until Mr. And Mrs. Smith, My all time favorite was Grosse Pointe Blank.  But when this movie came out, I said to myself \\"THIS MOVIE ROCKS!!!\\" it's dark but not so dark that it puts people to sleep.  This movie has outstanding Action sequences, great humorous lines, a good looking actor, and the most beautiful actress of all time.  You can't go wrong with these factors plus a soundtrack with nothing but love songs and the director of \\"The Bourne Identity\\". This movie is at the very least a must see.

0224071262|1.0|This is a fiction rather than a biography which it pretends to be. I managed to read the first 10 chapters hoping this book might provide a new perspective on Mao's life. However, this book turned out to be a completely biased joke. It seems to me what happened was the authors decided Mao was a devil and then started collecting or more accurately distorting the fact to fit the view. In these ten chapters I have read, most of the critical claims cannot be substantiated and most of \\"facts\\" either cannot be verified or can be interpreted in a completely different way. This book certainly should be read as a conspiracy book or a pure fiction.
B0006GAOBI|4.0|This movie kept me till the end with endless curiosity and wonder and I can tell others were too for it seems this movie provoked a strong following. It is worth its fans though it is a very good and fascinating film with truly, as they say behind the scenes, a universal meaning. The whole plot though is something so amazing but mind- boggling that you just feel you need to talk to your friends or your parents about it right away after you watch it. This movie raised so many questions honestly and probably made a lot of people expand their thoughts just a little more for a little while about possibility and how limitless it truly is.   Why this movie is not five stars readers may wonder? The ending itself, though understandable and satisfying, may not be easily understood the first time you watch it. I know it didn't for me. I was a bit confused the first time I watched the ending, so it was lucky for me that I waited until it came out on DVD so I could go back to the ending once or twice and put the pieces together more slowly. Yet it only takes once or twice glance at the ending again to get it. The point is though the ending isn't exactly a sure thing for most when they watch it for the first time, so I guess that is why they lose one star. After looking back once or twice though in the last few moments of the film, it all eventually comes together into again like I said a satisfying and good ending.   Overall I liked this movie a lot, and I do think this year it is one of the best films I have seen. I'm glad I took a chance on it. I'm just terribly afraid of rabbits now... I don't want to explain too much of the film because it is just so exciting and also creepy, so I'll just leave you with an exciting mystery.  Oh yes and watch the second disc if you can on Donnie Darko and watch the ultimate number one fan guy. He is very obsessed with this movie; it's so funny! And watching Jake G. dance behind the scenes? Priceless.
B00004Z459|2.0|There are two different types of listeners out there.  Those who listen to music they connect with via lyrics and those who appreciate a good beat.  If your in the latter category, add one star.  Linkin Park never really tries anything overly complicated, but their guitarist does the job. After hearing songs like A Cure For The Itch, I personally think they'd be better of without the DJ, but occasionally, he does add some nice atmosphere to songs like Crawling.   <br />    Now, if your like me, and listen to songs for their lyrics, then take away a star.  Most of the songs are very similar dealing with typical angsty teen issues. Running away, Being lonely, Having Social anxiety are all to common themes in Linkin Park's music.  Songs like A Place For My Head and One Step Closer are so similar, I actually mix them up on occasion.  Meteora is slightly better than Hybrid Theory because they tend experiment with different sounds.  Really, Don't waste your time with Linkin Park if your above the age of 13.  In time, you'll be too ashamed of owning one of their CDs and have to end up selling in anyway (i did).

B0002KQNZO|5.0|the first time i heard the jazz messengers i was in my car listening to some public radio jazz show. a minute into the tune \\"free for all\\" and i began to stare at the radio in disbelief. i actually became nervous because the song i was hearing was so great i was sure that the dj would not bother to mention who i was hearing or would mumble something incoherent like, that was owhiubuigwugw. add into the mix my wife and three kids along for the ride, were all babling away. so the song ends, and  about three more other songs were played. finally the dj starts mumbling like i knew he would and i kept hearing all these names - cannonball adderly, thad jones/mel lewis orchestra and a couple of other artist i dont remember, and im yelling at my wife write that down! write that down! so i took that napkin list to the cd store and bought all of them. just because free for all is such an amazing tune. but wait! the rest of the album is just as good! as a matter of fact the tune \\"the core\\" actually matches it in intensity. all of the musicians on this cd are just amazing, in fact i was so smitten with the trumpet playing by freedie hubbard on this cd (the trumpet solo in the core is just stunning)i went and picked up a whole bunch of his cd's and now im getting into wayne shorter as well. and of course let me not forget the awesome drumming of art blakey and the stellar musicianship of bassist reg workman, pianist cedar walton and trombonist curt fuller. just a terrific album and the others i had to buy with it were great as well! as a side note if you like the last song on this cd \\"pensativa\\" you can hear an absolutely killer live version of it on freddie hubbards the night of the cookers cd. its 22:15 long and contains one of the most awesome trumpet duals between freedie and lee morgan! lee of course was the trumpet player for the jazz messengers after freddie. also i would like to add that for all the intensity this collection of tunes has, it is one of the most melodic jazz cd's i have ever heard. i frequently find myself whistling these tunes to myself. just a great, great cd. highly recommended.
B0007GAERG|5.0|This cd can definitely be added to the list of Mariah's best. All the tracks have hot beats, and she really does her thing lyrically and vocally as well.

B0000029GA|5.0|\\"Illmatic\\" is the perfect rap album. This is the one album ever made that bridged the old school to the new school, the best producers to the greatest MC, real world lyrics to straight fun. Nas introduced himself as the world's greatest rapper here, and although he would defend this title for years to come, he would never match the quality of \\"Illmatic\\". He paints stories of life in Queensbridge, his beloved project, makes philosophies on the state of the world, reminisces over his younger days, and obviously has a lot of fun. What's so beautiful about \\"Illmatic\\", however, is that Nas could never have done it alone. It's totally a group effort, because Nas recruited only the greatest producers of 1994 for this album. Put it in the CD player and treat yourself to the productions of Large Professor, Pete Rock, Q-Tip, L.E.S., and DJ Premier. \\"Illmatic\\" is probably the only hip hop album ever to have immortal lyrics matched by such immortal production, which is why it is widely considered hip hop's bible.<br /><br />The album starts with an intro, where Nas and his friend AZ have a conversation about the state of current rap and life over a dope beat. If it weren't for \\"The Genesis\\", I doubt that albums would have intros like they always do today. \\"NY State of Mind\\", Primo's first track, is the first song that Nas paints a ghetto portrait for the listener. \\"Life's a B**ch\\" is one of the greatest hip hop collaborations of all time. AZ leads in with one of my favorite verses (\\"Visualizin' the realism...\\") and they give their young philosophies on life. Large Professor produced that excellent beat. \\"The World Is Yours\\" was revolutionary, and is the reason Nas is regarded as a ghetto prophet. The piano and bass beat is done by the one and only Pete Rock, and Nas is still recycling lyrics from this song to this day. \\"Halftime\\"'s technique changed hip hop for good, and it's jazzy beat only enhanced it. \\"Memory Lane\\" might be my favorite song on \\"Illmatic\\". Primo's toned down beat with keyboard and vocals is perfect, and Nas takes time to reminisce and think. \\"One Love\\" is Nas's classic talk to a friend in jail, produced by Q-Tip. \\"One Time 4 Your Mind\\" and \\"Represent\\" are both legendary storytellers with great beats and hooks. \\"It Ain't Hard to Tell\\" is one of my favorite songs ever, with it's ultra-jazzy and souled-out beat, it's the most purely old school track here.<br /><br />\\"Illmatic\\" was successful in melding the quickly progressing hip hop world to its early nineties styles, and in so revolutionized rap in itself.

B00000IQC8|2.0|I saw this on cable. It was mildly amusing. I was able to pass the time pleasantly for 2 hours watching \\"Clerks\\". But I really can not understand why anyone would think it was a great movie or hilarious. Jay and Silent Bob were much funnier in \\"Dogma\\". I also could not understand why any young woman would consider the main character serious boyfriend material. All the characters except maybe the lasagne girl are losers.
B0007GAERG|1.0|Riding on the coattails of Beyonce's success, this opportunist has copied Beyonce's signature look right down to the very hue of her skin complexion. Man, what a good photo-editing software can't do these days.  <br /> <br />Also to be noted is the shift from the one-word project titles. Following in the lines of Rainbow, Glitter, and Charmbracelet, this one should rightfully have been called Trash. Though escaping it's pre-determined title, the content certainly lived up to it.  <br /> <br />The songs are lyrically ill-fated, predictable, and melodically weak. Looking at this singer's (and I use the term loosely)tracking record, this album should fizzle out all together within a month or so. Then there will be the imminent dry-spell period lasting 5-6 years of which there will be numerous flops and failures. But fear not; with the advent of the new Beyonce, she will also ride in the afterglow of this new \\"it\\" girl's success, but at 43 years of age it will prove a tad difficult to pull off.
B000929AJQ|5.0|With_Teeth is awsome! It appeals to old fans and new fans as well. I was plesntly surprised, but it took me a few times listening to it before I knew for sure how much I liked it. I was prepaired to be disapointed as I was w/ the Fragile, but now through the years that is one of my favorite albums as well. <br /> <br />You can tell that Trent wanted to see if he could do something different. And he pulled it off well. There are few heavier songs and some more mellow than what he's done for awhile. Whether your favorite NIN ablum is Pretty Hate Machine or the Downward Spiral you will like this album. <br /> <br />If you are a die hard fan, like I am, then you will surely love the new twist in the NIN legacy. I love every nails song from \\"Purest Feeling\\" to \\"Screaming Slave\\". This is something in between, but still just as great.
B0009353IW|4.0|El Maestro Ry Cooder somehow brings the literary genre of magical realism to music in this enthralling portrayal of a long-vanished L.A. community.  He creates his own magical landscape where an alien vato in a low-rider UFO crash-lands in the barrio, a City employee is pursued by the House Un-American Activities Committee, Fifi and Smiley hit all the hot spots, and where all the while, three cool cats do three big flips.      This isn't the effortless, fun music of \\"Buena Vista\\" - the listener has to pay attention and think about the lyrics.  But the rewards are many for the engaged listener.  Cooder maps out a landscape using music and spoken word as his paints.  It is magical, gritty and tragic, and the valedictory song \\"Soy Luz y Sombra\\" leaves us with a plea for healing and understanding.    Listen carefully.
0671867369|5.0|This extremely well researched and excellently written book will raise the awareness of the uninitiated and evoke the reader's every human emotion.  Reflecting on the training rigors these heroes subjected themselves to, for the purpose of preparing themselves to face the possibility of death in combat, left me with an even greater appreciation and admiration for these men and their service  to our country.
B0000669JL|5.0|this cd is great. The music reverbs and takes you uo and transports you to a place beyond where spirituality and wisdom reigns. All these words coming out of his mouth are whispered from Gos's mouth to his ear. How can you explain a man coming out of the ghetto and being so articulate and expressive and wise and spiritual. Bob's lyrics ring relevant and true today.  <br />every time i listen to bob's music it's like prayers from God. I feel very blessed to have heard, seen, and witnessed this prophet's presence.

0345350472|5.0|+++++<br /><br />The essence of this science fiction novel, by Philip K. Dick, is about bounty hunter Rick Deckard finding and \\"retiring\\" several sophisticated rogue androids or \\"andys\\" that look and act like humans.  His assignment is not that simple.  Why?  Because these androids don't want to be found.  As the story proceeds, Deckard develops a relationship with an even more sophisticated android.<br /><br />This is just the \\"essence\\" of this novel.  It is really a philosophical, introspective story and as a result action is kept to a minimum.  This story deals with a wide range of themes, the main one being: what does it mean to be human?  As well, there are twists and turns along the way that kept me interested and surprised.<br /><br />Unlike some of the other reviewers, I found the actual writing fantastic.  Dick thoroughly convinced me that his story was taking place in the year 2021.  He superbly creates a portrait of the Earth devastated by a nuclear war and how humans cope in this now new world.  The science and science fiction were also well presented as were characterization and dialogue.<br /><br />Here is an example of Dick's writing where he describes the more sophisticated android, Rachael:<br /><br />\\"Rachael's proportions...were odd; with her heavy mass of dark hair her head seemed large, and because of her diminutive breasts her body assumed a lank, almost childlike stance.  But her great eyes, with their elaborate lashes, could only be those of a grown woman; there the resemblance to adolescence ended.  Rachael rested very slightly on the forepart of her feet, and her arms, as they hung, bent at the joint: the stance, he [Deckard] reflected, of a wary hunter of perhaps the Cro-Magnon persuasion.  The race of tall hunters, he [Deckard] said to himself.  No excess flesh, a flat belly, small behind, and smaller bosom-Rachael had been modeled on the Celtic type of build, anachronistic and attractive.  Below [her] brief shorts her legs, slender, had a neutral, nonsexual quality, not much rounded off in nubile curves.  The total impression was good, however.  Although definitely that of a girl, not a woman.  Except for the restless, shrewd eyes.\\"<br /><br />The original title of this novel is \\"Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?\\"  It is also sold under the title of \\"Blade Runner\\" because the 1982 movie of the same name was based on this novel.  I definitely agree with the publisher when he/she says:<br /><br />\\"Though the novel's characters and backgrounds differ in some respects from those of the [movie], readers who enjoy the latter will discover an added dimension on encountering the original work.\\"<br /><br />This was what happened to me.  I saw many years ago the original, theatrical movie first, read this novel, then saw the original movie again.  From my experience, reading the novel does add another dimension to the movie.  (Note that the movie is the original, theatrical release, not the cut up and, in my opinion, bad \\"Director's Cut.\\")  Be aware that Deckard in the movie is called a \\"Blade Runner\\" but in the novel he is only referred to as a bounty hunter.  As well, in the movie the androids are called \\"Replicants\\" but in the novel they are only called androids.<br /><br />Thus, I am puzzled when some of the other reviewers say that this novel and the movie are totally different.  Did they actually read this novel?<br /><br />Finally, the only problem I had with this novel is that occasionally the author goes into talking about things that I had a difficult time following.  This was sometimes frustrating.  But, like I said, this only occurs occasionally and so I was able to tolerate this.  Also, some readers may find that the androids were not as ferocious and cunning as they were in the movie.  This is because this novel is more philosophical while the movie is more action-orientated.<br /><br />In conclusion, this novel is, in my opinion, a masterpiece of science fiction that really makes you think.This is truly an intelligent, science fiction novel!!<br /><br />(first published 1968;  22 chapters;  main narrative 215 pages)<br /><br />+++++This is truly an intelligent, science fiction novel!!<br /><br />(first published 1968;  22 chapters;  main narrative 215 pages)<br /><br />+++++

B00005JNZ4|1.0|#1 - For starters, the two leads must fall into one of two categories (A) that they have waited almost too long for the right person, and are about to miss their chance to love forever!  Or (B) they have both been hurt before and must learn to love again - (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!!) <br /> <br />#2 - Be sure the female comes from a large extended family that is insuffarably close-knit, are all generically interchangable with one another, and can each come up with witty lines for EVERY situation! (MUST LOVE DOGS? CHECK!!) <br /> <br />#3 - Be sure the male lead is emotionally sensitive and has a passion for something obscure - like hand-carving wooden row boats, for example. (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!) <br /> <br />#4 - Ensure that the female lead has a gay best friend to have \\"girl talk\\" with!  This role was previously filled by a more ambiguous guy friend who was a sharp dresser but never got girls (the 80s), then by a female friend who was a whore (late 80s, early 90s), then a female friend who never got any guys (early 90s), then a flamboyently gay man (late 90s, early 2000s), and now it would seem to be a gay COUPLE that is throroughly fulfilled in their monogamous, sexually non-threatening relationship. - (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!!) <br /> <br />#5 - Ensure that the female characters at some point spontaneously burst into a singing-and-dancing moment to the tune of some classic old song - (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!!) <br /> <br />#6 - Have one of the main characters obsessed with an obscure classic film from the 40s, 50s, or 60s that no one has watched for the last two generations! - (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!!) <br /> <br />#7 - Finally, and most importantly, the girl must waver between one of at least two choices for her one-true love - and then decide in the last minute of the movie to dramatically and romantically run to catch the one she had rejected all along - but in doing so, she must suddenly overcome some obstacle - a river, a traffic jam, a train speeding away! - (MUST LOVE DOGS?  CHECK!!!) <br /> <br />So, in short, MUST LOVE DOGS is a cookie-cutter, by the book amalgamation of every Romantic Chick Flick you've seen for the last 20 years.  There is nothing original here - it is boring and annoying - and I hope all of you will avoid it in droves!!
B00004WLXZ|4.0|Triumph of the Will, is a great documentary especially for the time  it was created.  Its masterfully created, and puts into prospective how the German people followed such a murederous regime through brain washing and excellent propganda.  Some may find this film to be boring, but true WWII enthusiasts will absoultly love the authenticity of the product.  The film included excellent footage of Adolf Hitler and his \\"goons\\" as each regime member makes statements at the Nuremburg Nazi Rally which include Hess, Goebbles,etc.  The english commentary in my opinion is awful, as there is no enthusiasm in the narration.  If the narrator, was at all good I would have given the review a 5 ***** rating however, you can always turn the narration off using the DVD film options. <br /> <br />If your interested in Hitler, the Nazi regime, or WWII you will LOVE this film.  Moreover, be sure to watch this with an open mind and remember the era it was created in.  Excellent film for WWII movie collections......

B0000AQS0F|4.0|Whedon has always been a high-concept man, summing up the gist of his shows in one sentence is staggeringly easy.  Buffy is the valley girl as world savior.  Firefly is the Wild West in Space.  Others have done this Wild West in space thing before but never this explicitly.  I am still on the fence about the soundtrack which still clashes no matter how much I see it.  Whedon's most daring dramatic exploit as well as his trademark is to combine extreme emotional situations with sarcastic skewering comedy, shown most ingeniously with the fake death in the Pilot episode.  His filmmaking pedigree has always been surprisingly avant-garde for television.  His directing on all of his series is singular.  Here he is incorporating jump cuts, fractured scene structures, and overall a more somber mood.  The hand-held CGI was jacked by Battlestar Galactica.  (A good show in its own right, but far more serious and heavy-handed)  All said, Whedon's guidance is impressive, and just adds to the anticipation for the Firefly movie where he has hopefully the budget and power to do what he wishes to do.  I still don't get why Firefly was cancelled, this is the network that lets lowbrow base entertainment like Joe Millionaire co-exist with intelligent well-written dramas and comedies like 24 and Arrested Development.  Firefly definitely had cult show written all over it, but so did X-Files and that lasted for 9 years and made Fox untold millions.  But they had to have some regrets otherwise they wouldn't have greenlit the movie.  Maybe the movies will be a better medium for this story, probably not, but I'll hope.
B0002DRDBE|2.0|Boy, that Kevin Smith fella sure is clever. Or that's what he'd have us believe, anyway. His forte is painting cruel caricatures of people and having us laugh at these one-dimensional representations of human beings as they do improbably cruel things to each other. I guess you could glean some sort of philosophical staement from this, but don't try. Just know that in every Smith film there is a lot of intellectual jerking off and bad acting. I mean, Jesus, the acting in this film was cringe-inducing. The only redeeming aspect of the flick was Jason Mewes delightful performance as a caustic, foul-mouthed drug peddler.
B00003CXCD|5.0|My girlfriend recently went on a trip to Rome and we decided to pick this up as a memento of her adventures. Rome is a star equal to Gregory Peck and Audrey Hepburn. Visits to the Colisseum, the Face of Truth, and a motorcycle ride through outdoor shops are some of the adventures that would make one long to visit Rome or reminisce about times there. The story is charmingly romantic with the rough reporter finding a soft spot for the princess seeking to escape her golden chains for a day. Hepburn is stunning and I was surprised to learn that this was a breakout role for her, so confident and assured does she appear as an actress even this early in her career. I can see how she won an Oscar for this performance. As much as we peek into the life of an imaginary princess, this movie marks the coronation of one of Hollywood's true royals.<br /><br />4.5 stars<br /><br />--SD
6304765789|5.0|This is another thrill ride you can't afford to miss! If you like \\"The Usual Suspects\\", then I highly recommend this film to you. I cannot imagine another great picture in years after this on. With a tag and cast/crew like this; it is well written, well scripted and above all, well performed! Again, my tape's worn out due to many viewings and I need to get the DVD.
B00005ABX0|4.0|...but it's OK. As a twofer, this is a great buy. If you put Smiley Smile on its own, you'd probably be an angry consumer. Wild Honey rounds out the purchase with some very ebullient songs of love and devotion to augment the snippets of Smiley Smile that are worth hearing.  <br /> <br />Smiley is more a set of musical ideas than a collection of songs. It's as if they had some great harmonized bridges but didn't have any songs to put them to.  Brian Wilson's naturalistic/spiritualist bent is no longer hidden in teenage symphonies to God; rather, there are overt references to the importance of health, food and exercise-which makes for odd pop, to say the least. It is also interesting as a psychedelic/dope document, just to see how whacked out even America's squeaky cleanest band had become due to drugs. The only cuts which hint at improvements/continuances of the \\"Pet Sounds\\" pop symphony approach are \\"Heroes And Villains\\" and \\"Good Vibrations\\". Other than that, it's a stripped down home recording of the Beach Boys getting wasted and occasionally sounding breathtakingly together and beautiful. <br /> <br />Wild Honey is yet another album of home recordings, but done with so much soul that it really does fill you up with optimism and sunshine at its finest moments. A new direction for the Beach Boys, and a great one. Still earthy and odd in places(it's still Brian at the helm, what would we expect),but the killer cuts like \\"Aren't You Glad\\", and \\"Darlin'\\" are straight up pop masterpieces. Evidently Brian tired of being a rock vanguard and just wanted to get back to doing songs. Released in 1967, part of it has that hippie stamp on it that signals that something comes from the late 60's era, but the other half is an anticipation of the early 70s' return to three minute radio gold. They strike it about 4 or 5 times on Wild Honey. <br /> <br />Good stuff, many reasons to get this.
B0000004V2|5.0|Beautiful songcraft. Every track on this album is a spine tingler, especially the jam out session at the end of I am The Resurrection. Its a timeless classic.

KEVIN IS AN AVERAGE KID WITH NO SUPER POWERS NO SPECIAL TELEKENETICS, HES JUST A WISE ASS AND THAT IS WHATS GOOD ABOUT THE HOME ALONE MOVIES, MY FAVORITE PART IS WHEN HE IS WATCHING THAT OLD MOVIE WHEN THE ROBBERS KNOCK ON THE DOOR \\"KEEP THE CHANGE YOU FILTHY ANIMAL\\" DOES ANYONE KNOW WHAT IS THE NAME OF THAT MOVIE? I WOULD LOVE TO KNOW.
6303908306|5.0|This picture is totally mind boggling! Five cool actors manipulated themselves into the \\"film of the century\\" to the world of Kaiser Soze. It is an ingenious plot which took control and influenced every character in many, many devious ways. The whole picture is full of grip, I was waiting to see what's next scene-by-scene...Kevin Spacey is incredible, the whole cast is incredible!!! Indeed my favorite film of all time. My tape is worned out due to numerous previews, now I need to get the DVD version.
B00005MAM2|4.0|This film is a great sci/fi animation film that helped make America aware of some of the best talents wern't all from here or Europe but, also in the East. By todays standards this film is finally looking old yet, unlike todays animated films this was painstackingly all done by hand and trick freeze film cel photography. Like star wars this film pulled some nice tricks that just made you go wow how the hell did they draw that and make it look just like how it'd be in the real world. Plus this film had some of the best orgional music score unlike a lot of todays animated films which just feature crappy pop hits either from japan or the united states. The very beginning where the bikes are racing through tokyo to the end where kenada leaves our realm the music fits perfectly and moves the story in such a way.... The only thing i've never been able to figure out is why Pioneer felt the origional voice dubbing in english was in need of redubbing?  Some of the new voice characters on the new one are plain flat wrong for the characters.  Also, they changed up the dialoge cause like crappy star wars remakes they felt people didn't totally grab the concept of the film so they dumb it a bit for those who couldn't figure out what was going on... Pick up an old VHS copy and you'll see what i mean.... The only fault i ever thought this film was rather weak on was the middle part of where the captian fights with the city council members on what to do with Akira and the situation that was spiriling out of control. It's rather weak for what it was trying to show and a little bit too wordy with no substance.....Course for how this went down in the graphic novels and how big it was it's rather hard to press it all into a 2hr film without some content being lost... Regardless if you saw this film for the first time back in the eighties or just last week this film is the Citzen Cane of animation.  Not all can stomach this film just like citzen cane....The film itself is worthy of a five star rating but, it gets a four cause of pioneer failing to also give us the origional dub version....Strangly the LaserDisc version had all three versions of this film so, not sure why they felt not compelled to do it again on dvd....
0393312836|5.0|I first became familiar with A Clockwork Orange in 1972 as a 20 year old in Northern California going to the movies with my sisters and friends to see what it was all about.  I was first struck by the brilliance of the soundtract but immediately next by the comedic violence that quickly lost its humor.  I found the film a witty satire, but I missed the meaning of the Mechanical Orange for a long time.  I thought of it as reflecting the circular journey of Alex and all the uselessness of the system and all its bizarre, hypocrites along the way, ending up where he began.  Perhaps there was some logic in that view?   <br /> <br />Most of all, I loved the music.  I recall feeling highly critical of people who condemned the film because of the violence in it.  The violence wasn't the point but an illustration I thought.  I still ocassionally listen to the soundtract, it is as brilliant as ever, but I rarely view the movie.  Once you understand the point, this is not a film for entertainment, but for re-exploration of the themes.  I was disturbed to hear that copycat gangs had sprung up and were going around actually hurting people.  Anyone who argues that movies and video games do not produce copycat behavior in some people should be reminded of this.   <br /> <br />I still think the movie (and book) has value.  But it may be very different now.  In a time when our society has gangs everywhere and even the MS13 running around seemingly at will, the idea that at a point young men (mostly) grow out of it may be our only hope. But how DO we deal with it?  The film (and book)has an important message couched in the question; \\"What makes a person truly good? However, it does seem that only people concerned with higher values care.  Current gangs are not concerned with intellectualizing their lives at all.   <br /> <br />I always thought that the film made the point that even religion was manipulative in this sense.  In the film when the reverend claims \\"The boy has no choice.He is forced to be good by mechanical programing rather than a conscious moral choice.\\"  (This is a paraphrase, not a real quote).  But what struck me in the film is that the reverend was earlier threatening Alex and all the other prisoners during a preaching sermon with horrible torture in Hell.  Myself, I see no difference in Behavior Modification methods as the \\"Ludovico Technique\\" represented or the religious brand of what turns out to be the same proposition.  Perhaps a political compromise where a prayer could be said during the subjects treatmemnt would have made the reverend and the Church happy because the Church was being involved in a State mandated intrusion into questions of moral conduct via the consciousness of an individual?  \\"As the PM said, who cares about the details, the fact is that it works!\\"  We would try whatever we thought would suceed in ending the cycle of youth gang violence if we had the chance, I'm guessing. <br /> <br />I have read many reviews of the book and the movie and no one I have read has mentioned this problem.  I read that A. Burgess himself a religious man was attempting to convey that moral choice is important.  But how does anyone reconcile this when entire cultures all over the world seem to depend on some form of moral programing from birth?  Is anyone really free to choose?  I am reminded of the exploration of inherent good and evil in books like \\"Lord of the Flies,\\" and \\"Heart of Darkness.\\" <br /> <br />Perhaps the true message of a book and film like this could be that we need to explore the question of thought freedom.  Free thought and action as opposed to programed thought and action like the \\"chicken and the egg\\" may in the end be locked in an odd circulum of contradictions - A Clockwork Orange?
B0009A40ES|4.0|Great movie! Christian Bale gives a convincing, chilling, dead on performance of Patrick Bateman. I couldn't picture anyone else playing this part but him! Overall it is a great movie (i also suggest the book) with comic relief from the disturbing killing scenes, and I highly recommend it! (especially if you are a Christian Bale freak like myself!)
B0000017CA|5.0|I haven't been impressed much by anything recent so I just listen to some of the old stuff, like this album, which for some reason not too many people are familiar with. It's southern-tinged sludgy doom metal with some death/thrash metal riffs, psychedelic solos, distorted hardcore shouts, and a grunge attitude, especially in the laid-back harmonic vocals and poetic lyrics. To call this a combination of Melvins, Morbid Angel, Neurosis, Eyehategod, and Alice in Chains wouldn't be too far off. There are quick death metal bursts that slip in, but overall it's an atmospheric album. Even though the powerful doom riffs are heavy and aggressive, they're calming in its slow-pace. The mood this album creates is a dark, pissed off, insane, and nihilistic one while you're in a tranquil state, something not many albums could pull off. Every song needs to be listened to from beginning to end. Acid Bath pulls an influence from many metal sub-genres so smoothly, yet they aren't unbelievably technical or wildly experimental. It's an easy album to listen to from first to last track where every song has its own identity. A true classic.
630469654X|4.0|This is a fantasy so it takes great libertys with thing but overall it is an enjoyble movie. The Mouse played by Matthew Bordrick escapes from a dungeon and meets up with two people. who are lovers but a cursed by an evil Bishop. Who lusted for Ladyhawke. Her and her Lover are cursed she to be a hawke in the day and human at night her lover a wolf at night and a human by day. So they spend though they are always together they are never together as humanbeing at the same time. The double whammy of the curse. There is action suspence and love in the movie. It is overall and enjoyable movie. I have only seen the VHS mode of this show.
B0006L16N8|5.0|One evening in the Spring of 1998, over a four-hour drive across the Maritimes that was essentially comprised of me squeezed into the backseat of a friend's older brother's car, my eleven-year-old ears found themselves tuned to the small speaker on the lefthand side passenger-door, which poured out a fast, raw, yet melodic kind of music that I had never before heard in my lifetime. I eventually mustered up the courage to ask the Older Brother what was playing, and within a few hours the twenty-five dollars my parents had given me for \\"emergency expenses\\" had found a purpose: Making Friends, by San Jos-based punk rockers No Use For A Name. It's safe to say that, if not for this group's existence, my taste in music would likely have been forever altered-a scary thought when you consider the current state of mainstream bands.  <br /> <br />I begin with that digression because my introduction to independent music through NUFAN also provided me with an everlasting gratitude towards them. This gratitude would soon come in handy, because I got into the band at a point in their career where they were about to make considerable changes to their sound and, by consequence, their fanbase. Let us remember that their glory days are thought by the vast majority to have been between 1995 and 1997. At the time Fat was a respected but modest-sized label, with only NUFAN, Lagwagon, and possibly Good Riddance selling any considerable amounts of records. Of course, the label's popularity dramatically increased over the years. Fat got bigger and wealthier, and eventually could afford to carry this bigness and wealth into the albums that they released. Nowadays all of the bands on Fat, regardless of their folk leanings or deliberately overpowering guitars, sound clean, crisp, and professional. The signature Fat-sound has been taken in stride by pretty much everybody; rarely will you see someone criticizing, say, the crystal-clear acoustic beginning of a Larry Arms song. Unlike their FatWreck peers, however, NUFAN hasn't received the same generous treatment. The main reason is that the band decided to rely on a more accessible, mellowed-down sound. But a deeper reason, I think, is that the band also decided to discard their image as one of the 90s prime raw skatepunk acts: the rough-edged torch-bearers had thrown away their torches and begun to play nice, and people took offense to that. More Betterness!, with its clean/poppy guitar tone and vocal style, brought detractors to say that the band had \\"sold out,\\" a ridiculous assertion if there ever was one. Its equally accessible successor, Hard Rock Bottom, fared well with critics and open-minded listeners, but not with most of the old-time fans. However, my immense gratitude towards the band made me overlook all of this criticism, and I was able to see that, rather than softening their sound, NUFAN were putting an emphasis on melody instead of energy, and, rather than going nu-emo by writing acoustic ditties, they were merely incorporating new elements into their sound to ensure freshness and longevity.  <br /> <br />So, after seven years of losing and gaining fans due to change, NUFAN have dropped their ninth full-length, Keep Them Confused. Does it revert to the sound found on their mid-90s album? Has the band become even poppier than before? Well, yes and no, and both answers apply to both questions. Keep Them Confused essentially marks a progression into a more rock-based territory, with nonetheless a few strong nods to their early skatepunk roots that were perhaps overlooked in the last two studio albums.  <br /> <br />First, the rock. By design rock is slower than punk, and many of the songs on this album are effectively mid-tempo in speed. However, the crunchy and buoyant guitars call to mind the anthemic, no-nonsense brand of rock from acts such as Duvall and Jawbox. As far as melodies are concerned, this is easily the most accomplished album NUFAN have ever recorded. They are mainly pop innature, though I use \\"pop\\" in the same way that I refer to the summer-bright harmonies of groups like the New Pornographers and the Shins-begging to be sung-along to, but possessing plenty enough of substance and depth to endure countless listens. The chorus of \\"There Will Be Revenge\\" borrows the finest parts from Jawbreaker's \\"Sluttering\\" to be addictive upon first listen, but the band transforms the remainder of a song into a punky romp that will cause many bodies to move when played live. The soft verses of \\"Black Box,\\" which consist of an array of violins, synths, and acoustic guitars, explode into a mesmerizing chorus that would dominate the airwaves were it ever made available on commercial radio.  <br /> <br />Then there are the nods to the past. For starters, the production on here is much beefier than their last two studio albums, giving the songs the same loud (if cleaner) sound of Making Friends. Tony Sly's voice hasn't reverted to its early rawness, but he sings quite aggressively throughout most of the record. Though they have been reduced in numbers, there are still some fast moments on this album. \\"Part Two,\\" \\"Check For A Pulse,\\" \\"Bullets,\\" and \\"Killing Time\\" all showcase NUFAN at their fastest; there also appears to have been a special emphasis on the band's part to give these fast songs more bite than they've had on the past two albums. A special note about \\"Bullets\\": it's their hardest since \\"The Answer Is Still No.\\" Purists rejoice: Tony even screams!  <br />Sly's lyrical repertoire continues to improve with each release. It should be noted that Keep Them Confused is more political than anything they've done in the past. The fallacy of religion and its role in the ongoing war presents itself in \\"Divine Let Down\\": Guilt is an entity of its own fall from grace/And self-worth is their reminder/To feel out of place in your own home. Yes, the relationship songs that have irked so many maintain their presence, but Sly has constantly steered clear of sounding cheesy. Take the aforementioned \\"Black Box,\\" with its poignant metaphoric lines: \\"Our worlds collide in new beginnings/It's an emergency permission to bail out/So when the heart crash lands/What memories will survive?/I thank my black box that I'm alive.\\" And in \\"Killing Time\\" Sly combines political commentary and relationship together to describe a mother's hopelessness at the face of her son's defection to Iraq: I feel like I'm lost, drowning out at sea/Surrounded by space with no regard for sympathy/She sees the parade for victory and war that wasn't won/\\"I'm not coming home; he's my only son.\\"  <br /> <br />Keep Them Confused is both an amazing and an interesting album. It's amazing in that it provides us with twelve melodic songs that rank near the top of NUFAN's extensive catalogue, and it's interesting in that it leaves us with one pressing question: what next? Will the band venture deeper into the mid-tempo rock territory showcased here? Will the fans' response to \\"Bullets\\" spark the band to revisit their sound of yore? Regardless of the direction NUFAN eventually choose to take, the variety of material presented on this record is so great that people should look forward to whatever choice the band makes.  <br /> <br />To summarize Keep Them Confused, I'll say that it finally marks a point in which the band has found an original sound. As great as they were (and still are), NUFAN's mid-period albums won't ever be included among the most original recordings of the 90s. This record, however, brings a truly original brand of rock, pop, and skate-fueled punk that I've yet to hear from any other band. My one complaint about Keep Them Confused is that it's nowhere near as life-changing as Making Friends. But then, to me, no other album is or ever will be.  <br /> <br />

Secondly, parts were extrememly hard to believe.  I dealt with it though, because the beginning of the novel said it was a true story.  So I treated it as one.  I even told countless things from this book to people thinking that it was true.  And maybe it was, but at the end of the novel, suddenly you find yourself unsure.  I felt cheated.  Overall, I thought this book was boring and disappointing.  Pick up a different best seller.

For the machines to win, they will need to grow, to end their perfect, static existence.    Choice and free will are constantly highlighted in the Matrix trilogy.  Initially, machines only obey, and humans disobey.  Can machines evolve to be more like humans, or can machines be \\"compelled to disobey\\"?    In Genesis God forbids the Tree of Knowledge and puts an exit door to the Garden of Eden so that Adam and Eve will disobey and leave. This is why God creates a Serpent to tempt Adam and Eve, and why God put an exit to the borders of the Garden of Eden.  The goal is not endless happiness in paradise, but growth through change and suffering.    Can the machines grow like humans and return to the Garden of Eden?

0767814037|5.0|Led by an all-star cast, Silverado takes the viewer back in time to the classic wild west western, complete with barroom brawls, gunfights, stampedes, and wagon trains. <br /> <br />Emmett (Scott Glenn) has just been released from prison after serving five years for a \\"crime\\" committed in self-defense.  While on his way to Silverado, he's attacked by a group of outlaws.  He's unsure why he was attacked, but as time goes by, he realizes they were hired guns of Ethan McKendrick (Ray Baker).  Ethan's father was the one Emmett killed in self-defense. <br /> <br />Soon, Emmett comes across Paden (Kevin Kline): a man left to die in the desert after being ambused by his own group of outlaws.  After freeing Paden, the two ride to Turley to bust Emmett's kid brother Jake (Kevin Costner) out of jail.  He has also killed in self-defense. <br /> <br />The last rider of the group is Mal (Danny Glover), a meat packer from Chicago who's heading back to Silverado to help his family out on their farm.  During the course of the movie, Mal saves the group on several occasions. <br /> <br />Upon arriving in Silverado, the foursome finds out that the McKendrick clan has a firm grip on the town and have even instilled thier own sheriff, Cobb (Brian Dennehy), a former friend and riding companion of Paden.  Emmett and Jake realize that the longer they stay in Silverado, the more danger they are getting into.  What will happen between Paden and Cobb?  Will Emmett and Jake make it to California safely? <br /> <br />This is a movie that has all of the elements of the classic western from the 50s and 60s.  Loaded with gunfights, brawls, horses, and bad guys, this movie has everything that the western fan will enjoy.  There's even a showdown on the main street at high noon!  I give this movie my highest recommendation.  Although I'm not a real big western fan, this movie really caught my attention, and I thoroughly enjoyed  every minute of it.  Watch this great film and get a sense of what thewild west was really like.
B00005R2IS|5.0|`Mad Max', an Australian flick and one of the very first movies to feature Mel Gibson has probably been seen by most people after they saw the two sequels, `The Road Warrior' and `Mad Max, Beyond Thunderdome'. This circumstance has probably lead to a lot of misunderstandings about the circumstances of the original `Mad Max' plot.<br /><br />Basicly, the story is about the failure of an organized system of justice, leading to a downward spiral of individual, outlaw revenge and retribution. Unlike the relatively new post-apocalyptic genres exemplified by the latter two movies, the issues of revenge are as old as the classic Greek playwrights, all the way up through Eugene O'Neill's take on the old Greek story of revenge in `Mourning Becomes Electra'.<br /><br />There is but one little clue that this is a post nuclear war scenario. This is when we see a rusty and delapidated sign warning of a `Forbidden Area'. The only corroboration is the relatively poor condition of the sign over the entrance to the police station. Balanced against these minor visual clues is the spanking new sign over the door to the service station indicating that this is a licensed auto mechanic and the very clean and efficient looking hospital room and building.<br /><br />So, if there is any failure of civilization, it is largely metaphorical and seen in the failure of the constraints of lawful behavior to prevent a series of events based on unbridled libido and revenge.<br /><br />Of the `Mad Max' trilogy, the second, `The Road Warrior' is probably the best for many reasons, and it's connection to our current subject is loose at best and it's production values are far superior, but our original has an odd rawness about it which should not be confused with poor quality. TV stations would not be running this flick regularly if it did not have something special to offer.<br /><br />By far the most valuable currency offered up by `Mad Max' is the anxiety created for Max's wife and child in the last third of the movie. The fear is about as raw as it comes, with an odd similarity, based on the crude cinematic technique all the way around, with the terror of the original `Texas Chain Saw Massacre'. The horror movie is much less artfully done and draws a lot of it's impact from pure quantity of gore, but there is a strong sense that both movies gain from a lack of polish.<br /><br />Oddly, I think most of the juice in this movie comes less from Gibson's performance as that of the heavies. Unlike Harrison Ford's early appearances in `Star Wars', for example, I see little of the promise which Gibson shows in the second and third films in this series.<br /><br />I will go out of my way to watch the second and third movies, but the first, this `Mad Max' is really something of a guilty pleasure which survives rewatching and grows in stature as time goes by.n the last third of the movie.

0790729628|5.0|`Blade Runner', directed by Ridley Scott and starring, in one of his most important roles, Harrison Ford, is quite probably one of the best science fiction movies ever. I would easily put it in the top five with Fritz Lang's `Metropolis', Forbidden Planet', `2001 A Space Odyssey', and another Phillip K. Dick inspired story, `Minority Report'.<br /><br />I was originally disappointed with this movie when I saw it in the theatre, as it was based on one of Dick's most famous stories, `Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?' and the screenwriters took significant liberties with the story. But one of the surest ways of identifying a high quality movie is when it `grows' on you after repeated viewings. I have probably seen the original theatrical release on VCR and DVD and on broadcast TV at least five times, and I look forward to every viewing. The things which grow in my appreciation of the film as time goes by are Ford's performance and Ridley Scott's great invention of a very dark Los Angles some fifty years (from the time of the filming) in the future. The dark settings are a Ridley Scott trademark and they show up most dramaticly in `Alien', `G.I.Jane', and `Black Sun'. While the effect is great in the Sci-fi and Horror flicks, it really doesn't work in `G.I.Jane', but that's another movie.<br /><br />`Blade Runner' seems to have embedded itself into our collective unconsciousness. I happened to see an Alton Brown / Food Network special on TV yesterday where our golden boy, AB quoted a line from Sebastian's geneticly engineered minatures in `Blade Runner'.<br /><br />This movie seems to be the sort of work where everything just seems to hang together very, very well, from the set design to the music to the acting. Virtually all the roles in the movie are small compared to Ford's character, the Blade Runner, Deckard, but there are some which make one wish they had larger parts. Joe Turkel fits his part perfectly as the founder of the Tyrell Corporation. M. Emmet Walsh is also perfectly cast as Deckard's former captain of the Blade Runner unit who calls him back into service. Sean Young does well as Tyrell's closet replicant. The greatest little pleasure outside Ford's role is the performance of William Peterson, much better known as the Larry of the three brothers, Larry, Darryl, and Darryl on the `Newhart' TV show. Brion James, a lesser character actor similarly carries his part well. The two most difficult parts to assess are those by Rutger Hauer and Edward James Olmos. I suspect Olmos is given a major visibility in the credits for this movie more due to his widely recognized part in `Miami Vice' than to his role in this movie itself. Regarding Hauer, I often thought this was by far his best performance and that his whole career is based on the recognition he got from doing this movie. But, having recently seen `The Hitcher' again, I sense that while Hauer does well in these very sinister roles, his acting range is really limited and, like Whoopie Goldberg in `Ghost', the acclaim should go not to the actor but to the casting director.<br /><br />Oddly, I suspect one of the biggest differences between the theatrical release and the director's cut is to make just a little more of Olmos' role in the movie. The theatrical release doesn't even add any lines for Olmos, just a few more for Ford / Deckard to explain Olmos' character. In general, the theatrical release added just a little more voiceover dialogue to explain things early in the movie and to give the ending a slightly more upbeat resolution.<br /><br />I was really disappointed with the extras on these DVDs, as missing is my favorite feature, a voiceover commentary by director which explains the scenes in the movie. I suspect that unlike Kevin Smith's movies which make more money in DVD release than in the theatre (and who therefore puts a lot of effort into DVD extras) `Blade Runner' is so good, the DVD producers feel no need to pile on the goodies.<br /><br />This is atruly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis./>This is a truly great movie whose value increases as time goes by and other filmmakers are unable to top it's story and great atmospheric interpretation of a classic Sci-Fi hypothesis. <br />
B00097A5I6|5.0|With glimpses of brilliance on 2002's Heathen Chemistry, anticipation for Oasis' next record was very high.  The boys from Manchester do not dissapoint.  This is a shocking record that shows Oasis never really went away.  This truly sounds like a record from 1966. While everyone else is trying to modernize to fit with the times, Oasis goes back in time to create the best record of the year thus far.   With the opener, you can already tell that this is not the same Oasis from Standing on the Shoulder of Giants and Heathen Chemistry.  The massive swagger is back and Oasis is again in top form.  On the opening chords of the organ on Turn Up the Sun the listener is wondering where is Oasis, then the guitar kicks in and the madness begins.  Liam snarls \\"I carry a madness everywhere I go,\\" which epitomizes the Oasis ideology and shows that Oasis never really left.  Other highlights include Liam's gentle shocker \\"Guess God Thinks I'm Abel\\", Gem's \\"Revolver\\" era Beatles tribute \\"A Bell Will Ring\\", and Noel's whimsical masterwork \\"The Importance of Being Idle\\".  But the true shocker is the bookend of the record \\"Let There Be Love.\\"  The Gallaghers share vocal honors on this haunting and brilliant closer.  Oasis has always ended their records with classic songs, but with Let There Be Love they present their only closer that comes anywhere near the anthemic \\"Champagne Supernova.\\"    Oasis never left and this records proves it.  Oasis has created the best record of 2005 thus far, and show that they are once again one of the most important (and best) bands on the planet.  Excellent.****1/2
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|This made-for-TV movie is based on a best-selling Robert B. Parker novel and features Tom Selleck as a former Los Angeles detective who has semi-retired and become the chief of police in Paradise, Massachusetts. He is faced with two seemingly unrelated crimes that end up being related by the end of the story.     First is the gang rape of a young high school girl, which Tom handles particularly well in an audience-pleasing scene in which he allows the girl's father to beat the living heck out of one of the cocky-punk rapists and his father....probably not a realistic scene, but (let's face it) it's just what we all wanted to see.    Second is a series of seemingly unrelated murders perpetrated by (and this is not a spoiler, since the information is given very early in the movie) a self-proclaimed ultra-cool, jet set couple who apparently murder for fun and sport. If you are familiar with the old \\"Thin Man\\" series, they will remind you of Nick and Nora Charles, except, of course, they are repulsive psychopaths. They sip martinis, talk about the nightlife in Miami Beach, and look down their noses at the riff raff upon whom they prey. You become quite anxious for them to receive the same treatment as the rapist and his father, but old Tom has an even more special plan in mind for them.    Tom Selleck does what he does best....he plays Tom Selleck. Much like John Wayne, he is just one of those actors who never seems to disappear into his character. But that is OK, because it works perfectly in this story. He is tough, laconic, painfully honest, and just the kind of guy you would want on your side if your daughter had been raped, or deranged serial killers were stalking your small town. Like good wine, he just gets better with age.    This was made-for-TV and shown on CBS, probably in an edited form. The DVD version has an \\"R\\" rating (for no good reason that I can see, it should have been \\"GP\\"), but there is really no intense nudity, cursing, or violence. The productionand cinematography quality is excellent, the plot is clear and well presented, the acting is very good, the villains are hateful (a necessity), and the overall viewing experience is quite enjoyable. There is a possibility that it may become a television series. I recommend it.
B000002UD0|4.0|John Lennon has written some of the greatest music ever recorded, but with this 1974 release John Lennon creates what inevitably was his weakest album (I don't consider Sometime in New York City or Double Fantasy John Lennon albums.  Yoko ruins those.)  But what makes Lennon so good is that he can take weak material and make it sound amazing.  His vocals save many throwaway tracks and makes this album listenable.  Though there are weak tracks, stronger tracks overcome them and create a genuinely enjoyable listen.  \\"What You Got\\" has Lennon rocking with the some of the most passion of his career, \\"Steel and Glass\\" is one John's more haunting numbers, while \\"#9 Dream\\" encapsulates Lennon's stargazing ability and proves to be the best track on the record. <br />This record was not meant to change the world, and it didn't, but John Lennon writes music that is enjoyable to listen to.  Don't expect too much from this record, just listen and enjoy. Very Good. ****
B00001OH7P|5.0|Bowie's follow up to Hunky Dory is a great concept album. Under the persona of Ziggy Stardust, Bowie sings songs about society through the eyes of Ziggy, an alien rock star. A more rock album than Hunky Dory also has some great lyrics about society and the music business. Favorites include Five Years, Moonage Daydream, Starman, Lady Stardust, Hang on to Yourself, Ziggy Stardust, Suffragette City, and Rock & Roll Suicide. A great rock album with some great messages. Highly Highly Recommended.
B000000WF0|5.0|Few records have been made with so much tension in the group. (\\"Let it Be\\" being one that comes to mind)  For all the tension, this record is very cohesive and indeed proves to be one of the best rock albums I've ever listened to.        With the opening grandiose epic \\"Bittersweet Symphony\\", Richard Ashcroft's genious is instantly visable.  The song flows and intertwines so well, it is one of the more memorable tracks ever recorded.  But the record doesn't merely stop after the opening track, instead it flourishes into the gentle \\"Sonnet\\", then erupts into the souring \\"The Rolling People\\".  But for me, the album reaches epic heights with fourth track \\"The Drugs Don't Work\\".  This is a shocking number that puts Ashcroft into a select tier of songwriters.  The execution is prefect, while the lyrics are some of the more haunting and perfect to be recorded in quite some time.  Now this is the point of the record that indeed solidifies it as one of the greatest.  None of the following tracks are weak by any means.  In truth, \\"Space and Time\\", \\"Weeping Willow\\", and \\"Velvet Morning\\" coexist with the strong opening tracks and hold their own to create absolutely no let down at any point during the record.    To me this record stands alongside \\"Definitely Maybe\\" (Oasis) as the predominant records of the 1990's.  An amazing experience to listen to. Classic. *****
0790744295|5.0|The collabaration between Stephen King and George A. Romero really works in this horror classic. King's screenplay with Romero's direction makes this a fine piece of work or works if you want to call it that. The dvd is terrible, but I'm reviewing the movie not the dvd. The first story is a good revenge story. Ed Harris plays one of the victims. The second is kind of depressing. King is great as an actor and this role was meant to be played by him. The third story is a really good revenge story but with a twist. Leslie Nielsen and Ted Danson are great in their role especially Nielsen adding his funny charm to a more dramatic role. The fourth story is the longest and is good but is a little drawn out at times. Hal Holbrook is great as a man who would do anything to get rid of his wife. Adrienne Barbeau is also good as his wife. The fifth is a weird story about a millionaire who puts people down his whole life but is about to pay from the littlest of visitors. E.G. Marshall is great as the millionaire. This movie does have some scary parts but also has alot of funny moments in it. Highly Highly Recommended.
B000002AS3|5.0|Definitely Maybe is quite simply one of the greatest Rock 'n' Roll records of all-time.  Oasis presents the songs with such swagger and confidence that you can't help but enjoy the album.  The record kicks off with the massive Rock 'n' Roll Star.  This is the best example of the Oasis swagger.  They are claiming to be stars even though they had yet to even sell one record.  More highlights include the psycadelic political statement \\"Up in the Sky\\", the amazing anthem \\"Live Forever\\", and their tribute to the Sex Pistols \\"Bring it on Down\\".   For me the best track of the record is the groovy and trippy \\"Columbia.\\"  Originally supposed to be an instrumental track, Liam takes on a world of his own with Lennonesque vocals.  This is one of the few Oasis tracks that instigates the slide guitar.  Truly a brilliant listen.  What more can I say, their are really no flaws or weak tracks on this record.  To me, this and \\"Revolver\\" by the Beatles stand alone as the essential rock 'n' roll records.  Classic. *****
B0006A9FKA|5.0|When I saw this I couldn't stop laughing. It was like Dawn of the Dead mixed with a british comedy like Four Weddings and a Funeral. This movie is a much better zombie movie than that remake of Dawn of the Dead(horrible horrible how could they do Romero like that). Simon Pegg is great as the titled character Shaun whose life goes dull until the undead start coming. Though a comedy this film does have some dramatic points, one includes a spoof of a classic scene from Reservoir Dogs. Nick Frost is really funny as Shaun's friend Ed and the soundtrack is great and has alot of funny moments in it. Romero loved this film so much he asked Pegg and director Edgar Wright to appear in his new film Land of the Dead as zombies. I haven't seen it but heard good things about it so I will get it when it comes out. Until then I will enjoy this good zombie movie. Highly Highly Recommended.
B00006HBUA|2.0|This movie is about how scooby doo and the  <br />gang solved A mystery and blah blah blah. <br />The only reason I watched this movie was because me and <br />my sister could not find anything else to watch <br />Well It was A bad idea.It was dumb and stupied A 6 year <br />old would probably like it.The Reason I gave it two <br />stars was because it was kinda funny in parts and when <br />shaggys girlfriends eyes turned green my sister <br />looked scared so I laughed about that.This movie is <br />ok if your watching it on tv but dont buy it.
B00001OH7O|5.0|This is Bowie at his musical best. At first I didn't like this album, but after a few listens I see these are some some of Bowie's best thought up lyrics. Though a less rocky album the music is beautiful. The piano and guitar are both great. Favorites include Changes, Oh! You Pretty Things, Life on Mars?, Kooks, Quicksand, Queen B***h, and Bewlay Brothers. Highly Recommended.
0684833395|5.0|When my father told me to read this book, I was 13 years old.  I moaned and groaned but just said \\"to hell with it\\" and began to read.  From Chapter one, \\"The Texan\\" to Chapter forty-two, \\"Yossarian\\", this book held my interest for the whole ride.  Heller has produced not only a hilarious but an intelligent and well-thought scenario to place Yossarian into an inescapable paradox of authority and his own discombobulated resolve.  This novel also carries an excellent anti-war and anti-authority message, and will motivate a reader to stand up for what they believe in, not to conform to someone else's beliefs.  A must-read for anyone in their right mind.
0895260131|5.0|Robert Spencer's latest book; The Politically Incorrect Guide to Islam (And the Crusades) is what Islamic religious figures and organizations don't want you to see. It is a must read for anyone who has ever wanted to know the truth about, and the reason for the Christians Crusades, as well as what continues to truly motivate Allah's servants.  <br />  <br />This book is easy to understand, and keeps you interested, as Spencer lays it all out on the table. From the tumultuous days of Islam's founder, Muhammad, to today's Islamic leaders, and everything in between, this book exposes the truth about the Islamic faith that until now, very few have had the courage to speak openly about. It is much more than a book about the Crusades, it is a survival guide for the West.  <br />
0385338686|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was funny and entertaining- a quick read.  The plot was somewhat predictable (Girl meets gardener-Girl falls in love with gardener- Girl breaks up with gardener- Girl makes up with gardener) The heroine is a lawyer who makes a huge mistake and leave her job to work as a housekeeper- never having done any housework in her life.   <br /> <br />I am a huge fan of the Shopaholic books and Kinsella's other books have not quite come up to par.  Don't get me wrong- its good just not as good.  Although how can any other character really compete with Becky Bloomwood?
B00005JL78|2.0|Way too long, way too blue, way too nothing like the original Philip Dick story (far superior), way too formula Hollywood, way too much crap. Two stars for a couple interesting visuals, but that's about it. If you want Philip Dick done right, go Blade Runner, go Screamers, and then go Total Recall (yes, big budet Hollywood action, but it still retains a good Philip Dick core). Minority Report just sucked.
0783225725|4.0|A stranger rides into town, appearing as if out of nothing through the haze.  This town is called &#34;Lago&#34;, and is owned primarily by a mining company.  Nobody in town seems to have seen a stranger in quite some time.  The mining company has had quite some difficulty in the past with its hired guns.  A year or so earlier, they had three hired gunslingers protecting the town and the mine, but those had turned on a marshall to protect the mine's secret and been incarcerated.  The three replacements meet a quick end when they confront the stranger.  So, of course, the logical thing to do is enlist this strange drifter to protect the town from the first three gunslingers, now due to be released from prison.<br /><br />Eastwood's first western as a director is dark, sinister and mysterious.  This is a very atypical western, and is soaked in the cynical pessimism of 1970's cinema.  The stranger promises the townspeople that he can show them how to defend themselves, but when it comes down to it they have very little interest in defending themselves.  Flashback scenes show the townspeople hiding in shadow as the marshall was mercilessly whipped to death by the mining company's hired goons.  This is a town that has truly turned its back on the light, cowardly embracing the darkness.<br /><br />Truth and justice are the themes of all great westerns.  This film portrays a town so weakened by its own abandonment of those values that when faced with its own destruction it lacks the moral conviction to save itself from the lawless gunslingers who aspire to take what they feel is their due.  The townspeople are destroyed by their own moral corruption, and are impotent to defend themselves against evil because they have lost the ability to see themselves as the good.<br /><br />Is the stranger the old marshall?  The flashback scnes have Eastwood playing the role, as the marshall is bullwhipped for having discovered the mine's secret.  But the marshall has a grave, a fact the stranger remarks upon at the close of the film.  Is he a ghost of the marshall, an agent of justice visited upon the people of Lago to exact penance?  The film leaves this question open for the viewer.<br /><br />The stranger himself commits an act of sexual violence in an early scene, one which would be viewed with much more controversy these days.  A woman takes an interest in the stranger, a woman who had stood calmly and watched the old marshall die.  She endeavors to bump into him, and he sees right through the charade.  He takes her to a stable and has his way with her.  It is never quite clear whether this was rape.  She later claims it to be, but she embraced him during the sexual act.  In the metaphorical landscape of this film, the sexual act itself has no moral value, because the stranger is simply allowing the lack of morality in the townspeople to become manifest in the way the community responds to any act of wrongdoing.  He is reflecting the town's soul back upon itself, and I think this scene is part of that higher concept, but any scene depicting a rape or alleged rape is touchy, so just be aware that this content is in here.<br /><br />This is a dark western that shows much of the brilliance Eastwood would later receive acknowledgement of in his long career directing dramatic works.  If you are considering purchasing this DVD, which has no extra features to boast about, I would recommend it to anyone who is an Eastwood fan or otherwise considers themselves open to the limitless possibilities of the western film genre.close of the film.

B0009KA7BS|4.0|This seems to be the new inspiration for movies, comics. Now i've read my share of comics, and though I have never read this one, it stays true to the basic ideal of all movies, entertain. It does give you what you want, action, horror, great digital effects, and even the age old classic brush with mortality, Heaven and Hell. Though i'm sure there could have been better candidates to play Constantine, Keanu still played a good banished from Heaven and damed to Hell, demon slaying anti-hero. With Rachel Weisz playing a good counter to Keanu, the generic cop that asks to many questions and ends up with the same basic curse that Keanu is facing, but Heaven is a little more welcoming to her. As I understand, hardcore fans of the Hellblazer series will most likely not be a fan of this movie, but if your looking for a good movie to watch when your feeling a little bored and could use a thrill or two, this is a good movie to look into.
B0000AQS6R|4.0|The third and best of the Chevy Chase-National Lampoon series kicks off with Clark Griswold hosting this year's Christmas celebration.  Of course, that means lots of family, welcome or otherwise, showing up at his door.  Randy Quaid, playing cousin Eddie, shows up at Clark's home with his R.V., a total heap.  Clark does his best to have a good time, but nothing goes right.  He's brought to the breaking point with annoying relatives, Chistmas lights that refuse to work, and a bonus that causes him to flip out.    Christmas Vacation is a laugh a minute.  You know people liked the movie when they keep repeating some of the one-liners.  Here's some of my favorites:    \\"You couldn't hear a dump truck driving through a nitro-glycerin plant.\\"  \\"We're going to have the hap, hap, happiest Christmas since Bing Crosby tap-danced with Danny F-n Kay.\\"  \\"That there's a quality item.\\"    I watch this movie every year, usually right after Planes, Trains and Automobiles.  Not to be missed.

0425129608|5.0|Hercule Poirot, Belgian mystery solver extroindinare, seems to be a magnet for non-violent murders. At a fun seaside resort, Poirot is in the midst of relaxing among the gossiping guests (what else have they got to do?), with the main subject being stunning ex actor Arlena Marshall, who beguiles men and sucks them dry. Cruel and gorgeous, she may be useless, but that doesn't mean she had to die. So Poirot begins investigating the death of the strangled woman (she really was drop-dead gorgeous). And thus begins my first ever Christie novel, and I enjoyed it through and through. Christie gives dozen of red herrings and has you guessing who-dun-it constantly, each time differently, and by the time it was over, I was still wrong. Really, really enjoyable.
0783226837|5.0|i love the movie tremors, it brings back the great 50's monster movies but without cheesy dialoge, bad special effects, and hollow characters, not to mention i LOVE the graboids (thats what there called). anyway this story takes place in the isolated small town of perfection nevada. here the towns folk are under attack by giant worm like creatures with snake like tounges that grab you and pull you under. now they must make there way out of perfection and into the mountains (they can't go through solid rock). this is a real cult favorite and deserves to be reconized as a classic.
B00006HBUA|1.0|My 2 kids (ages 3 and 5) thought this was pretty great entertainment when we caught it on Nickelodeon tonight.  <br /> <br />Me, I liked it about as much as I liked 'The Phantom Menace'. At least I didn't drop $15 to see 'Scooby Doo'.  <br /> <br />Like Star Wars I, this movie packs plenty of action and stuff to look at, with almost zero chemistry or humor (except for you adult aficionados of fart jokes, you know who you are). Unlike SW1, the graphics here are pretty terrible.  <br /> <br />To be fair, Lillard (Shaggy) is great and Cardellini (Velma) has the voice down pat and is oh-so-easy on the eyes. But that's not going to be enough to make me watch this again

B000AP04FG|5.0|Mr & Mrs. Smith is one of the summers most entertaining movies. I have to say this movie was far better than i expected it to be. What makes this movie so awesome is the attatchment you get to the characters. Brad Pitt is awesome in this movie and hilareous as well. Angelina Jolie did a wonderful job as well. The chemistry between these two is intense and at times very believable. The movie does start out slow and is over the top at times, but it is really a great movie. I have always liked Brad Pitts (Fight Club, Troy) movies but with this movie you see more of a three dimentional character and not just some one dimentional hot looking guy on screen. If you like entertaining and awesome movies then check out Mr. & Mrs. Smith. The DVD will be released Tuesday, November 29th, 2005 and will be loaded with extras!
B00007M5CO|3.0|Latin rock producer Gustavo Santaolalla, founder of Surco records, home of Molotov, Juanes, Orishas, Erica Garcia and many others, sets the scene for another innovative move in Latin music with the new label Vibra, which will become home to acts blending Latin music and electronica. And if Bajofondo Tango Club is look at what's to come, we're in for something that's going to turn heads in the International music scene. While not for Tango purists, the tracks on Bajofondo Tango Club blend in key Tango trademarks such as minor keys, adept bandonen melodies, and sexy violin runs, with a refreshing electronica punch and groove. The key for this album is in the blending -- it's like blends of wine, if the merlot overpowers the cabernet, for example, the mlange doesn't work, it tastes like merlot with some cabernet in it. And this CD is not Tango with some electronica splattered in, it's a true mixture of styles (except for sometimes, where dance beats tend to overpower). Some of the finest blends include: \\"Montserrat,\\" \\"Perfume,\\" \\"Esperndote,\\" \\"Duro y Parejo\\" and \\"Ese Cielo Azul [*]\\"

1558908846|1.0|I had great difficulty even finishing this movie.  Maybe I would have enjoyed it more if I had been familiar with the comic series it was adapted from, but I found it lacking in almost anything a movie CAN lack.  The acting felt stiff in most cases, the plot was simplistic, and nothing really caught my attention.  It had an interesting enough premise that I'm pretty disappointed that I found the movie to be this terrible.
0380002930|5.0|. . . it might be.  It's all right for children, but is not a children's book.  A novel involving a society of rabbits.  They interact with other rabbits, other animals, and people.  As you would guess, the behavior of the rabbits is metaphorical for the ways in which people often interact with and treat each other.  A masterpiece.  If you haven't read it, you've got a gaping hole in your reading resume.  You won't be disappointed.
B0002OERI0|2.0|In case you thought otherwise, this is a bad thing. The fact that 50 year old Bush-hating soccer moms keep American Idiot in their Volvos doesn't help Green Day's credibility. <br /> <br />There are two catchy songs off American Idiot: \\"Holiday\\" and \\"Boulevard\\", but even those have lost their charm due to their sickening overexposure (FUSE'S 100% Green Day, VH-1's Storytellers, and Live 8). Most of the songs are nothing special, and have none of the short blasts of ardreneline that Dookie and Insomniac had. There are so many sluggish points on this album that one listen was enough for me. I hate \\"Wake Me Up\\" and \\"St. Jimmy\\". The fact that Green Day chose a 'theme' for American Idiot makes this CD even more unbearable, because Billie and co. were working from a predetermined formula of incorporating references to the recently-deceased Jimmy Ramone (of the Ramones), who I don't give two sh*ts about. That formula really ruined any chance of spontinaity Green Day became famous for over a decade ago. Stick to their Lookout material, as well as Dookie and Insomniac.

It's pure Badfinger, and masterfully wrought too.  My favorite track on the album.  Pete Ham comes back to life.
0385474547|5.0|Not only was this book interesting from start to end, it was more thought-provoking and deep than all but very few books that I have ever read.  The story of Okonkwo as he endured the trials of colonial changes and the rigors of his own tribal culture is one that has meaning for everyone because we all encounter and are forced to deal with trials and changes that we have no control over.  This book also vividly describes the great injustices that colonialism forced on many primitive cultures.  It does all this with a very even hand:  Okonkwo's village life is not portrayed as an idyllic Eden, but as a harsh and often cruel culture that will appall most readers.  Okonkwo, himself, is not the sympathetic victim we expect him to be.  In fact he would be considered a cruel monster by our standards. Yet, because of his dedication to his culture and tribe, and his complete lack of comprehension of anything foreign to that way of life, we are able to understand and feel what he feels.  His experiences, in certain ways, are metaphors of our own lives as we, with all our imperfections, deal the forces of change that are beyond our control.

B000A0GP0Y|2.0|This year there's some remakes that didnt make the cut (The Amityville Horror which was like the boring original) and there's one in mind that did (Assault On Precinct 13 which wasnt that bad) and unpcoming one's (The Pink Panther, King Kong...etc). The Longest Yard is one of the ones that didnt make the cut and which is utterly stupid with some funny one liners in it but otherwise its a Adam Sandler/Peter Segal failure. Sandler (Spanglish) plays ex-quaterback Paul Crewe who's career went down the toilet after he shaved points on a football game...so, he takes his bitchy girlfriends car, that would be Courtney Cox Arquette (Friends), in a drunken manner he piles 5 or 7 police cars ontop of one another and winds up going to prison...a country prison which a footballl fanatic Warden, played by James Cromwell (Babe). The guards are real nasty to its inmates and Sandler finds that out the hard way as he fights and gets into mischief. So, Warden Cromwell tells Sandler to make a team of inmates to play football against his guards and so Sandler does so with the help of the caretaker, played by Chris Rock (Madagascar) in a throwaway role and old timer Coach, played by Burt Reynolds (Dukes Of Hazzard) who played Sandler's part in the 1974 original. Not much fun here, with the usual Sandler raunchiness this comedy tries to take itself serious in some parts but its all too laughable when it does and most of the cast is rendered dumb. Also starring Rapper Nelly (Snipes) who cant act worth crap, Dallas Cowboy Wide Reciever Michael Irvin who is right along with Nelly, William Fichtner (Armageddon), Brian Bosworth (One Man's Justice), Bill Goldberg (Universal Soldier 2), Stone Cold Steve Austin, Tracy Morgan (SNL), Nicholas Tuturro (NYPD Blue) and a cameo by Rob Schneider (Deuce Bigalow Movies). Some people might find this entertaining but I certainly dont. Stick with the original people....hey Burt, what the hell man?
B00005JMJ4|2.0|This is what happens when Hollywood imitates an indie/art house cinematic effort.  In that respect the film is so lucky, because it has an instant defense to all who criticize it: if you don't like this film, obviously you'd rather be watching \\"Dukes of Hazzard\\".   <br /> <br />This film takes a formulaic Hollywood sensibility and gives it a languid, arty presentation.  The slow, slow pace would be okay if it were used to probe into the depths of the character's personalities, but it doesn't--maybe because there's nothing to the characters.  The girl lays around trying to figure out what she wants to do with her life, and the guy is having a mid-life crisis.  Nothing much more than that gets revealed, but compared to all the cardboard supporting characters, the stars seem like real 3-D personalities.  <br /> <br />The film does even worse with its \\"exploration\\" of life in a foreign culture.  I checked out this film because one review praised it for its look at the problems of dealing with life in another culture.  Since I've lived overseas for a number of years now, this sounded interesting.  Instead, one gets a series of boilerplate yuks about strange foreign cultures: everyone speaks a bewildering language (imagine!), the interpreter translates 45 foreign words into 3 English words, the Japanese people are short, etc. etc.  Look, the main characters of this movie are in Tokyo for a week or two and they seem completely alienated and devastated by it all--these people should definitely have stayed home!!   <br /> <br />Another comment about the glacial speed of this movie: was it really necessary for the karaoke scene to go on for so long?  You get the idea after the first song, that these are people in Tokyo amusing themselves with karaoke, that's what Japanese people do, after all (isn't it?).  After the second song, you figure that the point has been even better made, but by the third song, when Bill Murray starts to launch into the Roxy Music tune, barely able to keep from slipping into his Saturday Night Live lounge-crooner mode, you have to wonder what the point is. <br /> <br />If you like slow films, check out something by Bergman or Tarkovsky instead.  This one's just dull. <br /> <br />  <br />
B00069L0XG|4.0|<br /> <br />From all the reviews I've read for this movie, they're pretty mixed in opinion. Some people Have been ranging on about how the movie sucked and how \\"scantly dressed\\" the female characters (I.E., Jill Valentine and Alice) are and ect. But really, the reviews --- for the most part--- could not be more far from the truth than the Miami Dolphins lost in Baltimore. \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse\\" is the coolest movie of late summer 2004, only second to \\"Spider-Man II.\\" It's that great of a movie. Contrary to belief, \\"Resident Evil\\" had a major scare factor for me, I still cannot will myself to watch the Claustrophobic-filmed movie that left me with a sense of hopelessness for the characters as they were attacked by the former \\"Hive\\" employees of the Umbrella Corporation. So you can believe that when I heard \\"RE:A\\" was on Television (7-2-05) I had a pretty hard time willing myself to watch it. I was that scared of it. I had watched enough for the first movie to understand the sequel:  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />- [The Umbrella CORP. has reopened the hive after capturing Matt (Eric Malbus) and Alice from their narrow escape from the hive upon sealing it to prevent further contamination. Both have been subjected to laboratory experiments with the T-Virus under the orders of men named Dr. Isaacs (Iain Glen - Tomb Raider), but only Alice is left partially unscathed through the entire incident. However, Alice's attempts to keep the T-virus from escaping the underground facility were foiled by the Umbrella CORP when they reopen the HIVE and released the T-Virus and the lickers along with it. Thus creating mass hysteria within the walls of Raccoon City whose citizens have fallen prey to the deadly virus and are locked inside the city when it reaches the city limits.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Jill Valentine (from CAPCOM's Resident Evil game series, played by Sienna Guillory) a S.T.A.R.S. operative who was suspended for her accusations against the Umbrella CORP., her partner Pyeton Wells (Razaaq Adoti), along with whether reporter Terri Morales (Sandrine Holt), take refuge in a church after Pyeton is bitten by one of the recently undead at the city gate and are met with more trouble. Their saving grace happens to be \\"PROGRAM\\" Alice (Milla Jovovich!!) who has been genetically enhanced by the T-virus and Anti-virus, armed to the teeth with guns of every kind and superhuman strength to boot.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />The newfound group of survivors make their way through the city toward a hopeful exit before Raccoon City is sanitized by a Nuclear Missile strong enough to reradiate the virus and everything else. They're then contacted by Dr. Charles Ashford (Jared Harris), the creator of the T-virus, who wants them to head to the school where his daughter Angela \\"Angie\\" Ashford (Sophie Vavasseur; \\"Evelyn - 2001\\") --- whom he designed the \\"RED QUEEN\\" after ---- is hiding out after the van she was in was hit with a Semi truck. Right behind them S.T.A.R.S. elite Carlos Olivera (Oded Fehr) and Nicholai Sokolov (whom was a villain in the game. ---- played by Zack Ward) and the wandering Raccoon City resident pimp L.J. (Mike Epps) who also get a call from the so-called \\"Dr. Doom. Unbeknownst to the group as they approach the school, the Umbrella CORP. has unleashed their ultimate Bio-weapon \\"PROGRAM\\" Nemesis (from Resident Evil 3: Nemesis. Played by Matthew G. Taylor and not Eric Malbus) monitored by Major Cain (Thomas Kretschmann), whose primary objective is to kill all the S.T.A.R.S. members that were still alive and battle Alice for superiority of sorts.]\\" <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />---------- Apocalypse deals heavily with Alice regaining her forgotten memory after she is captured and subjected to tests and the secondary star of the movie \\"Nemesis\\" who was her friend, Matt Addison. While the movie deals with the subject of the undead, the plot is strictly character driven in theevery way possible; You actual care about what will happen to all the people who survived the outbreak in Raccoon City. The scare factor in the movie for me has diminished somewhat after I conquered my fear of watching it but it still holds some kind of fear over me when it comes to all the Undead scenes which are truly something to be scared about for the \\"most\\" part. Milla Jovovich's character Alice kicks Jill Valentine (who really isn't given much to do in the movie) to the passengers seat and really kicks major ass in this movie, the action scenes in this movie are a sight to behold, its practically nonstop through out the entire movie but does nothing to dissipate the movie's twisting plot.  <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />Alice's stunts are the coolest ever--- from the graveyard battle, the 100-Foot dash down City Hall (which Milla did the last of the stunt herself) to her battle with Nemesis, the action for this character is undeniably the best ever and better than her exploits in the first movie. Jill Valentine, however, manages to hold a special place in my heart and basically gets to do some pretty awesome things herself (Fighting the undead to some wicked handgun fights) but her range is basically limited since the movie is focused on Alice. The comic Relief provided by Mike Epps' character \\"L.J. ,\\" is actually pretty funny and does not kill the atmosphere of horror/action in the movie. <br /> <br />Oded Fehr does pretty a pretty good job with the limited character Carlos Olivera, he's never too macho and his character is quite likable (much like Nicholai was). Most of all the music is well fitted and plays best on the most important parts of movie overall. Best of all, Resident Evil: Apocalypse deals heavily with the video games in only a way the fanboys of the games would recognize. All in all this movie was up-to-specs and majorly different from the horde of Horror movies concerning the Undead that came out in 2004. There are indeed, plot holes big enough to stick your finger through but this does nothing to diminish the movie's high-rate enjoyment. Purchase this movie if your a fan of Milla Jovovich or the Resident Evil series, but consider this movie with an open mind. This movie contains brief scenes of nudity, mild-swearing, gory scenes, frightening images, and nonstop action violence (Written by Paul Anderson, Directed by Alexander Witt). FYI: The female protagonists, Jill and Alice are not \\"scantly dressed\\" they're quite covered with clothing for combat and easy mobility -----[a 5 out of 5]

0743454537|3.0|A child is conceived to save her sister. Chronic illness is a challenge to families.  This one has a mega-loaded issue of a genetically-matched sibling to serve as a spare parts facility.  The child, teenager Anna Fitzgerald, goes out to obtain an attorney who seeks her medical emancipation at age thirteen.   <br /> <br />As the sick sister, age sixteen, says, something is always falling apart in her.  The match was for the purpose of cord blood.  Things happened and failed to happen and so events moved on through several procedures to a bone-marrow transplant.  At present the sick child's kidneys are failing.   <br /> <br />The family, remarkably, is appealing and normal.  The oldest child, a male, is alienated.  The mother, a nonpracticing lawyer, has turned into a ditz under the strain.  The father has his job as a fire fighter to keep him more or less sane.  The writer has done a good job of making the reader believe in the reality of the characters and the reader is brought to the point of caring about their fates.   <br /> <br />A guardian ad litem is appointed who had a former relationship with Anna's attorney when they attended a ritzy private school in Providence, Wheeler.  The guardian ad litem was a scholarship student and she, Julia, had pink hair at the time.  Campbell Alexander's parents did not like his selection of a friend. <br /> <br />Jesse, the alienated son, remarks that no one in his family covers up mistakes.  Anna goes to stay in her father's room at the fire station when the emotions at home are at their peak.  That every family has problems is a cliche, but unfortunately this family has more problems than most.  One of the problems is that since the couple elected to create a designer child, the sick child has had more opportunities to get well and overcome various crises through the use of the body parts of her sister, and the family system has been in a dysfunctional mode for a very long time.   <br /> <br />There is a surprise ending.  Iwill not disclose it and spoil the reader's fun.
B00000DQSV|5.0|The bottom line on this album is that it's probably one of the most consistent Duran Duran albums out there, along with their debut album DURAN DURAN, RIO, and ASTRONAUT.  I've recently rediscovered NOTORIOUS and found it much better off than when I last left it.      Unfortunately, drummer Roger Taylor left Duran Duran right before the sessions for this 1986 album started, so he is sorely missed.  Though Roger could never be replaced, ace session drummer and ex-Average White Band member Steve Ferrone is fantastic (he currently drums for Tom Petty and The Heartbreakers) and lends some very forceful work on the skins.  Duran guitarist Andy Taylor actually left during sessions for the album, but his work can be heard on \\"American Science\\" and \\"A Matter of Feeling.\\"  Two other tracks feature Andy, though nobody in the know can recollect which, but most think it's probably parts on \\"Skin Trade\\" and \\"Proposition\\".      Duran tinkered with their sound on this album produced by ex-Chic member Nile Rodgers (who adds a lot of guitar on the album as well), with a decidedly more funk-like groove incorporated into almost every song.  Even so, some of Duran's finest recorded work appears on NOTORIOUS, and Simon Lebon has never sounded better.  Classic cuts include the addictive title track (#2 in 1986), the mysterious \\"American Science\\", the reflective \\"A Matter of Feeling\\" (supposedly written for the departed Roger Taylor), the rocking \\"Vertigo\\" and the funky \\"Skin Trade\\" (#39 in early 1987).  Honorable mention goes to \\"Hold Me\\", the cold and dark \\"Winter Marches On\\" and \\"Proposition\\".  Even the funkified \\"Meet El Presidente\\" and \\"So Misled\\", though the weakest tracks on the album, seem to sound better in hindsight than they did in 1986.      NOTORIOUS is an intriguing album because of its back story---Andy leaving in the middle of its recording, the slinky and awesome bass lines by John Taylor on almost every song, the addition of session guitarist Warren Cuccurullo who laterbecame a permanent member of the band through 2001, Nick Rhodes and his subtle yet effective keyboard work, and the artistic risk of Lebon, Rhodes and John Taylor altering their sound while trying to retain past glories.  All this notwithstanding, NOTORIOUS was still able to move over a million copies upon its release.    Of course, the Duran story has come full circle, with Andy and Roger back in the band and a top 20 album (ASTRONAUT) and sold out arena tour already behind them in 2005.  The song \\"Notorious\\" has been featured in the reunited original lineup's concerts, and continues to shine, even more so with Andy and Roger playing on the track in a live setting.  Even Puff Daddy himself, P. Diddy, sampled the title track.  Here's hoping that the Fab Five tackle more NOTORIOUS-era songs on future concert tours.    Highly recommended and hoping for a remastered edition soon.
B000002H4C|4.0|Okay, so the 'Heavy Metal' cartoon hasn't aged well. The soundtrack fares a lot better, once you get past the fact that aside from a few tunes (such as Sabbath's \\"Mob Rules\\") there isn't a whole lot of heavy metal music here. Instead, most of the songs on the CD are better thought of as late 1970s FM rock songs. This is the type of music AOR used to play before it mutated into classic rock and stopped playing anything recorded after 1973. All of the songs here are vaguely trippy hard rock, some with fusion aspirations, and some trying out for progressive. It's fitting music, because the original 'Heavy Metal' magazine was full of post-1970 psychedelic artwork. <br /> <br />Strong points include Journey's best ballad \\"Open Arms,\\" Blue Oyster Cult's \\"Veteran of the Psychic Wars,\\" a couple of former Eagle Don Felder songs, and Cheap Trick's \\"Reach Out.\\" The heavier side is represented by Sammy Hagar, Sabbath, and Grand Funk Railroad. I've no idea how Devo got in here, and I wish they didn't. For the most part, however, this is a very solid CD. <br /> <br />Music like this was swept aside by punk on the one hand and MTV on the other. At least until trip hop managed to sneak some of the laid-back grooviness in through the back door!

B0000844I8|4.0|Do 2005's summer blockbusters bore you? Are you tired of people defending weak, unimaginative retreads as \\"popcorn flicks\\"? Then sit back and enjoy one of the least pretentious and most entertaining science fiction films of the early 1990s. <br /> <br />\\"Stargate\\" is as far-fetched as they come, but it's far-fetched in a good-natured, Flash Gordon style. If you can accept that not only were the Ancient Egyptians actually lorded over by aliens but also that said aliens travelled to and from Earth via a teleportation device known as the \\"Stargate\\" then you know exactly what to expect from a movie like this. The effects, costumes and action are excellent, coming from a time just before the dominance of computer graphics. The plot moves forward cleanly and neatly in its Marvel Comics-kind of way and more than once the visuals and storytelling will remind you of the mood behind the original \\"Star Wars\\" trilogy. This is a fun sci-fi movie that doesn't pretend to be anything but a great time. <br /> <br />Above-average characterization is the most important ingredient in \\"Stargate.\\" Sure, James Spader was a bit too young to play the Egyptologist Dr. Jackson but he perfectly captured the idealism and naiviete of an academic out of step with his more experienced colleagues. Kurt Russell was absolutely fantastic as Colonel O'Neill; he gives a performance that is comparable to those John Wayne gave in his best-known films, and even looks a little like Wayne in some scenes. The two characters play well off each other, and we're never asked to swallow an overly warm relationship between the nonconformist Jackson and the career military hero O'Neill. <br /> <br />If you haven't seen \\"Stargate\\" before, I envy you. You're in for a treat!

0553213105|5.0|In my opinion, \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is Jane Austen's best work.  I think it is one of the best books ever written, and one of the very few perfectly told stories I have ever had the pleasure of reading.<br /><br />\\"Pride and Prejudice\\" focuses on the Bennett family --- Jane, a quiet and demure woman whose angelic countenance matches her sweet and giving personality; Elizabeth, a level-headed lady with slightly more temper than her older sister, and a level of good judgment that sets her apart from other women of her set; Mary, a bookish girl with little talent to speak of; Kitty, a weak-minded creature who allows her flighty youngest sister to rule her life; Lydia, a hopeless flirt with no thought for anything other than fun and men; Mr. Bennett, who likes to retreat into his library and bury his nose in books; and Mrs. Bennett, a foolish woman whose primary goal in life is to get all her daughters married off to rich and handsome men.  A simple family living in the country whose lives are turned upside down by the arrival of a wealthy young man into their neighborhood.<br /><br />Mr. Bingley, their new neighbor, instantly takes a liking to Jane, the oldest sister, while his best friend, the proud Mr. Darcy, spends his time trying NOT to like Elizabeth.  As Mr. Bingley gently pursues Jane, he finds he gets little or no help from his friend Mr. Darcy or his own sisters, Louisa and Caroline --- who schemes for Mr. Darcy's hand herself.<br /><br />Set against a vivid backdrop in various locations around the country, Austen covers all kinds of English society.  Her colorful, lively characters take this story all over the place, having their own adventures and learning about themselves and about life.  Jane learns that not EVERYONE is sweet and charming.  Elizabeth learns that first impressions can be misleading.  And Lydia experiences a dangerous kind of life that should never have been embarked upon, and which lands her in a very sticky situation.<br /><br />Jane Austen has a keen sense of the ridiculous and loves to poke fun at her characters.  \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" has one of the most delightful array of interesting characters ever to grace the pages of a novel --- the oh-so-charming Mr. Wickham, whose past is a mystery; the Gardiners, Elizabeth's aunt and uncle, who see much more than they let on, and understand its significance; Charlotte Lucas, Elizabeth's friend; Mr. Collins, the Bennetts' cousin, an oily clergyman who marries Miss Lucas after Elizabeth categorically refuses him; Lady Catherine de Bourgh, aunt of Mr. Darcy, a proud and unpleasant woman who likes to rule over and frighten others.<br /><br />Austen tells her story with the best mix of drama, wit, charm, humor, intrigue, and romance I have ever seen.  The story is writted seamlessly, unfolds brilliantly and ends perfectly.  The entire novel is beautifully written, with an elegant, charming style as only Austen can write.  It's the perfect addition to any library!
B00004X01U|4.0|This is another strong album by Madonna.  It is electro-pop, with a lot of good songs.  Of course, everyone knows the hits \\"Music\\", \\"Don't Tell Me\\" and \\"What It Feels Like For a Girl\\".  But there are other fine songs, like \\"Runaway Lover\\" and \\"Nobody's Perfect\\".  Madonna fans are sure to enjoy this album.
0451526384|5.0|\\"Persuasion\\" is one of Austen's shorter, simpler pieces, sweet and charming without as much intrigue as her other novels.  It tells the story of sweet, quiet, even-tempered Anne Elliot, a plain spinster disregarded by her family because she is not attractive enough for them.  Anne's only share of romance had been years before, with a naval man deemed beneath her --- a man named Wentworth, who she was persuaded to reject because of his lower connections. <br /> <br />Anne's father is a lazy spender who cares more for his vanity and title than his family, and spends them all to the point of bankruptcy and they are forced to move to Bath, giving up their long-time home of Kellynch Hall.  While the rest of the family moves, Anne is left to take care of the more menial tasks and visit her sister --- a woman who delights in \\"fancying herself ill.\\"  While visiting Mary and her family, Anne is once again thrown into the company of Wentworth --- now CAPTAIN Wentworth. <br /> <br />As is typical of Jane Austen, this novel is filled with charm, wit, and humor.  The story is perfectly thought-out, with just enough twists to keep it interesting, and enough romance to make you sigh.  The characters are flawlessly designed. <br /> <br />I laughed and I cried in this novel.  After \\"Pride and Prejudice,\\" this is my favorite of hers.
6305537321|4.0|If Helen of Troy possessed the face that launched a thousand ships, the young Audrey Hepburn must have been good for, say, nine hundred?<br /><br />From the moment she steps out of the yellow New York cab in front of Tiffany's, Hepburn dazzles, supported by the sturdy performance of George Peppard, who is the sensible foil to her zany role as Holly Golightly.  Peppard's Paul also makes his entrance by alighting from a yellow cab, but that is the last time he and Holly have anything in common in this film.  'Good thing opposites attract.<br /><br />I bought this DVD because I was born too late to know Hepburn in her glory days, and I wanted to understand her mystique.  Glory endures, and Breakfast at Tiffany's showcases not only Hepburn's flair for romantic comedy and witty one-liners, but also her darker side.  In spite of the fact that the genre assures you that things will turn out well, Holly Golightly's self-destructive side is authentically troubling as you make your way to the predictable d&eacute;nouement.<br /><br />Holly can't think of anything she's never done.  Still, her light touch and random quirks - she leaves her apartment's mailbox slight ajar, for it warehouses the perfume and the mirror she needs as she leaves to fulfill her duties as what today we would describe as a call girl - make her more than a workaday social climber.  'I do not accept drinks from disapproving gentlemen' is one of her tenuous claims to dignity as she strives to figure out who she really is, now that she's 'not Lula Mae any more'.<br /><br />Peppard's performance falls short of great acting, but if Hepburn needed a solid backdrop for her star turn, she found it in Peppard.  Half-way through the film, one finds oneself liking both of these characters: the safe, stolid one who is indeed a man that's 'kept by a woman' and the crazy 'real phony' - that's a good thing, in light of the alternatives - who is Hepburn's Holly.<br /><br />Hepburn has a lighter touch elsewhere, but Breakfast is worth anybody's viewing as a standard piece in an immortal actress' repertoire and a period piece of 1960s Americana.  I recommend it heartily.rd piece in an immortal actress' repertoire and a period piece of 1960s Americana.  I recommend it heartily.
B0009KA7BS|1.0|Constantine is a very bad adaptation of the Comic book called Hellblazer and when I say bad, I do mean bad. It really desecrates what the comic book stood for and shows that Hollywood only cares about themselves, not the fans. Keanu Reeves literally gives the worse performance of his career in this film and most of the actors around him follow his path. Only Rachel Weisz and Djimon Hounsou gives good performances in this heap of junk because they at the very least tries their best with the very bad script that they had to work with while Keanu and the rest of the actors ham it up to the hill.  <br /> <br />See it for their performances alone  <br />
B000068CNX|4.0|Season Two is still not the big machine humming at full throttle, but it was evident that Jennifer Aniston and crew were definitely on the way to something big.  The writing and acting is a bit more confident than the debut season, and Chandler comes into his own in a strong supporting role.<br /><br />'Mr. Heckles' emerges as one of the delightful cameos of the show, just in time to die.  We learn some basic background about several of the characters as the show's writers feel their oats.  Phoebe, for example, is from time to time tormented not only by the memory of her late mother, but also by her very much alive husband - surprise! - and father.<br /><br />Joey and Chandler fight it out like good roommates do, but find a way to put the pieces back together again, leaving us all grateful that Eddie is gone for good.  Ross and Rachel find each other in a serious way.  Carol and Susan tie the knot, so we end the season as convinced as we can be that Carol is a mere sidelight and is not coming back to Ross.<br /><br />Oh, and family dysfunction?  Can any group of human beings have a less promising family background, as Chandler might ask it?  The more we know about the homes that Phebes, Rachel, Chandler, and Monica come from, the more amazing it seems that these human beings can still stand erect?<br /><br />Maybe that goes as far as any single element to explain the growing appeal of these six friends.  In a generation of badly gutted family experience, these six individuals pursue some semblance of normality in spite of everything, and - with a little help from their friends - look almost set to achieve it.<br /><br />The patterns they seem intent on establishing for their own lives don't lead to optimism, but we sure did love them as they tried to figure stuff out.

B000000OQF|5.0|This is, along with Van Halen's first album, probably the best debut album of all-time. I recommend this 100%. But it's not just \\"Welcome to the Jungle,\\" \\"Sweet Child 'O Mine,\\" and \\"Paradise City\\" that make this a 15x platinum album. It's the supporting cast, such as \\"It's So Easy,\\" \\"Nightrain,\\" \\"Mr. Brownstone,\\" \\"My Michelle,\\" and \\"Rocket Queen.\\" I really can't pick out one bad song here; they're all hardcore, super-charged songs. This covers everything that a hardcore rock album needs: dancing with Mr. Brownstone, telling of a girl w/ a dad in porno and a mom that was a heroine-addict, etc. Lastly, I really stress the fact that Slash is the most underrated guitarist around. Take one listen to this album and you'll hear some nasty riffs and crazy noises coming from his ax. This is the ultimate album, no question!

0792164903|5.0|Sleepy Hollow is in my opinion Tim Burton and Johnny Depp's best movies. It was excellent! It is a dark movie putting Washington Irving's classic story to the big screen. The movie is therefore about Ichobod Crane (Johnny Depp) sent to Sleepy Hollow from New York to investigate a series of murders. The murders all have one thing in common. The murdered people all have been decapitated and their heads are missing. Everyone in the town thinks that the headless horseman is the murderer. Crane thinks that they are joking until he has an encounter with him.  <br />The movie is fascinating with a haunting score by Danny Elfman, gorgeous visuals, wonderful acting and an awesome ending. The movie also has awesome fights and adventure scenes.  <br />This movie is definitely on my top 25 films of all time. It's a movie that everyone should see. The visuals alone make this a must see. It's a movie that I will definitely rewatch soon and a lot in the future. This isn't worth a rent. NO, BUY IT!!!!!! YOU WON'T REGRET IT! You rock Tim Burton!
B0002KVUKM|3.0|When I first saw this movie, I was flabbergasted at the non-stop action, the INCREDIBLE art direction, (which will boggle your mind!) and some of the acting and writing, specifically Richard Roxburgh as Dracula and the women playing his \\"brides\\", who truly seem to relish their roles.<br /><br />However, I can tell you that this movie does NOT hold the same impressiveness on successive viewings. It, in fact, looks like a crazy quilt of CGI work, furious jump-cutting, and a constant aesthetic that is WAY too grim after seeing it only the second time! There should be some respite from all the ghoul-chasing so that a good contrast can be set, instead of a steady diet of lab-OR-atories, gothic architecture. lightning bolts and bloodletting. This worked with \\"Ghostbusters\\" and \\"Aliens\\", it should have been used here.<br /><br />That said, it does have some redeeming aspects, not the least of which is the wizard art direction, which must have driven the miniature people bazoomies! The intricate castles, furniture, room embellishments, and various devices that Van Helsing uses put you in mind of a high-budget version of the \\"The Wild Wild West\\" meets \\"Indiana Jones\\" meets \\"The Name of the Rose\\" meets \\"Ghostbusters\\". The writing, too, warrants some kudos....Jackman himself speaks a litany of James Bondian wisecracks all through the movie, but it is Roxburgh who gets the really good lines, along with David Wenham, playing Van Helsing's friar sidekick.<br /><br />I think I'm beginning to notice a pattern, though, in Hugh Jackman's movies....In X-Men 2, Deathstrike, a Japanese mutant that has a duel with Wolverine, played by Jackman, meets a GRUESOME death at the hands of the feral X-Man, having molten lead forced through her body by a berserker Jackman. In THIS movie, the Kate Beckinsale character, Van Helsing's potential love interest through the whole movie, dies....AT VAN HELSING'S HAND!! Granted, he was a werewolf at the time, but STILL...!! What does Hugh Jackman have against young women, anyway??<br /><br />Still this movie is going to come in awfully handy at Halloween, a season that it was made for!<br /><br />And as far as a ghoulishly-themed movies are concerned, you could do LOTS worse in today's market.??

6305718954|1.0|I was looking forward to watching this movie but I really dissliked it. First off, I found this movie to be terribly boring and the acting to be poor, notably by Patricia Arquette. I almost dozed off because of how boring it was. I swear tht it's got to be one of the most boring movies of all time. <br />Also, the scenes where Arquette suffers the wounds of Christ are strange and over dramatic. Oh, and then, like a couple hours later, she's fine. After she suffers Christ's wounds, she's fine. I mean, come on! She'd take a while to recuperate from it. She'd suffer pretty bad.  <br />You don't like any of the characters, especially the character suffering stigmata, who on top of it has a man's name, Frankie.  <br />But, the worst is the relationship between Father Kiernan and Frankie. They fall in love. I mean come on, that's idiotic! Seriously! The movie plays off other movies, copying off them basically and has many lame scenes, notably the lame and terrible ending.  <br />This movie deals with an interesting topic, but doesn't go anywhere and instead is boring, pointless, lame and idiotic. This movie is one that everyone should run away from and hide from.

The operatic lyrics the vivd vocals.....to die for.<br />Screenager:7/10<BR>Decent but something is missing, and it doesnt flow well after microcuts.<br />Darkshines:8.75/10<BR>Very good, catchy and delivers a good sound.<br />Feeling good:6/10<BR>The songs good but i dont see why they bothered to cover it. It doesnt suit their album or style.<br />Megalomania:7.5/10<BR>Good it would have gotten higher but this songs leave you hanging for more until u realize its the end...
0449002632|5.0|After reading this book you will have a great appreciation for the history of London and England in general.  This book traces the history of London since its beginnings as Londinium, a Roman outpost, until modern times. <br /> <br />The author weaves an intricate tale of characters that make this novel engrossing.  I was at no point bored with this book and finished it within a few days.  It is a well researched piece of historical fiction that anyone interested in that genre will like. <br /> <br />If you are heading to London then read this book.  It will give  you a better appreciation of the city.
B00082IJ08|4.0|Anyone who has seriously listened to Gorillaz first release realizes it is very difficult to enjoy the whole album.  While it has some brilliant hits like 19-2000 and of course, Clint Eastwood, it is marred by a schizophrenic nature and some real clunkers (like Punk and Suzuki Method).  An after-effect of too many different musicians spoiling the broth, I suppose. <br /> <br />Gorillaz new album, Demon Days, had less musicians writing the actual music (just Damon Albarn and Danger Mouse), and it shows: this album has a coherent feel and is brilliantly paced, which is certainly my favorite aspect of it.  Oh the whole, this new effort is more \\"chill\\" than the previous album: while some songs like Feel Good Inc and All Alone really cook, this CD is less likely to get your blood pumping than their previous album.  However, this is not at all a bad thing.  Albarn and Danger Mouse manage to inject unexpected and wonderful beauty, such as choirs and string ensembles, into almost every song. <br /> <br />Ignoring the strange introduction (which I usually skip), the album starts out with the nice and chill songs Last Living Souls and Kids With Guns.  Last Living Souls at first sounds sort of conventional, but suddenly the song breaks into an amazing string  solo, and Kids With Guns, while also starting out sort of conventional, has some great high-pitched wailing from Albarn which gives the song a jazzy edge.  As I've already mentioned, the pacing on this CD is absolutely brilliant: Albarn and Mouse step things up a little with the next song, O Green World, which is a little faster than the previous two songs.  It IS a very repetitive song, but in a good way I'd say.  Dirty Harry (a song I personally dont like so much) steps it up even more with light rap and some clever use of a children's choir.  The album reaches its first climax with Feel Good Inc, a song many of you have undoubtedly heard on the radio.  This is a cool club-style song with guest appearances from the great 80s rap duo De La Soul, and some really maniacal laughing. <br /> <br />After Feel Good, the album drops back to chill with El Manana, which is a little boring but nonetheless a nice transition from the previous track.  Every Planet We Reach has the potential to be a little overbearing with its very heavy chords, but is saved by some cool jazz piano from Ike Turner (!).  Like Dirty Harry, November Has Come is a relatively chill song with some light rap in it, and while I dont find the song terribly engaging, it still works as a transition piece.  Albarn ramps up again with three truly intense songs: All Alone is a clubby sort of song with a really fast and great rap segment, followed by the heavy industrial-style song White Light.  The album climaxes a second time with the really hip and dancy Dare, which I would guess will become their second single, with its fun beats.   <br /> <br />And finally, we get to the truly bizarre: Fire Coming Out Of The Monkey's Head.  Yes, that is Dennis Hopper reading a story to the beat.  Yes, the story is rather unhappy.  If you really take this track (can't justify calling it a song) in, you find that its deeply disturbing on a lot of levels.  Which again feeds into the brilliant pacing of this album: after this somewhat upsetting track, the beautiful first chords of Don't Get Lost in Heaven come as an amazing relief.  Heaven has an ethereal and relaxing quality to it, and neatly segways into the final track, Demon Days.  Incidentally, I dont really know why these two songs are separate, they transition so subtly that they really should be the same song (and Heaven isnt really strong enough to stand on its own).  Demon Days is a glorious song.  It starts out light and delicate, and then suddenly and rather unexpectedly blossoms with the unbelievably brilliant use of a female choir underlined by a vaguely reggae beat.  I know other reviewers have complained about this song, but I really love it.  You just have to hear it to believe it.  If you just listen to the music of Demon Days, it sounds like a very positive song, a relief from the darkness and negativity of some of the interior songs of the album.  However, the lyrics tell a different, much more negative story, one of being resigned to a bad fate.  I absolutely love when musicians do this: positive music and negative lyrics or vice versa.  For a great example of this, check out I Choose by The Offspring, an extremely upbeat-sounding song about a kid committing suicide. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a great album and a fantastic second effort from Gorillaz.  I can't give it five stars because I don't love the whole album.  However, if you read other reviews, you'll discover that other people like a completely different set of songs than I do, and dislike some of my favorites on the album.  The bottom line of this is that it is certainly worth your time for a listen, as a project this unique should not be missed.
B0002Z0EYK|4.0|I actually really liked this film.  It was fun to watch even having read the Iliad several times when I was younger and knowing it is quite flawed compared to it.  That is why it is called Troy and not The Iliad.   <br /> <br />The producers of this film make no attempt to present this as actual history.  They try to stick to the Iliad as much as possible but there are several realities that cause departure from this.  First off making this a 10 year war would have been very confusing and hard to do. Second hollywood does not know how to stick to a timeless classic and undoubtedly believes it can improve upon one.  <br /> <br />Despite knowing exactly what was supposed to happen I felt drawn in at every point.  I didn't want people to die that I knew had to.  The only thing I didn't like is that they let Paris live.  I may be mistaken but I am almost certain he was killed.   <br /> <br />I also wish they would have introduced Odysseus a little more.  That way if they ever wanted to do the Odyssey viewers would have more to go on. <br /> <br />As for the prop work it was pretty much as I imagined it would be compared to writngs from the Iliad as well as what was known about that historical period. <br /> <br />Good film, worth watching.
B0001L3MI0|5.0|What can I say? I love blow-'em-up movies. And you can't get this one on Columbia House! ;)
B0000028PI|5.0|Alice's greatest album by far!  The classic stuff was great I agree but the Last Temptation is the biggie.  It's perfect there's not much else to say.  The song writing, music and the production are all amazing.  And to top it off it is a concept album!  Truly amazing that someone can get stuck within a concept and still make every song awesome! <br /> <br />If you don't have this... get it!
B000002WYT|5.0|Some of our favorite hits are here to enjoy, such as So Much To Say, Crash Into Me, Two Step, and Too Much.  When this album came out, it sure made a dent in the industry.  I love Dave Matthews' upbeat positive sound.  A welcome addition to your music collection.
B0006IIPIK|1.0|Someone called this eye candy. Are they blind? Consistently bad photography and poor lighting do not constitute eye candy. If you actually want to be able to SEE any of the stars in this movie you will need to watch them in a different movie. The dreary visuals of this movie will drag you down sooner or later. By the way, I enjoyed the brown tinting in \\"O Brother, Where Art Thou?\\" which was masterfully done, so I'm not simply someone who dislikes any attempt to manipulate color or film. But in this movie, the attempt was poorly done and failed miserably. <br /> <br />As for the plot, I'm not the best one to evaluate it. It was so slow and so boring and so unfocused that I lost interest quickly. I couldn't make it to the end of the movie. <br /> <br />The characters? I don't know them as people and thus I don't care. And I always had the feeling that the actors were not sure about what they were doing or were not committed to the movie. <br /> <br />Once of the worst movies I've tried to watch in a very long time.
B000001Y79|5.0|Don't speak while I am playing this album because I want to hear every second of it.  Gwen Stefani's voice is awesome and unlike anyone else's that I know.  It is no surprise that she made it big.  And the format for the music is great too.  She has excellent support from her band.  It all comes together to make very good music, and a very enjoyable album.
B0009MDPYM|4.0|Constantine is the story of a demonologist/exorcist who was born with the unique and uncanny abilities to see and combat demons(and angels), and other creatures from hell. The story begins with the finding of the \\"Sword of Destiny\\" - the sword that was used to spear Jesus Christ on the Cross at Calvary - and ends with John Constantine battled none other than Lucifer himself.<br /><br />Constantine moves along at a good pace and provides an immersive story that will keep you engrossed. There are grand battles with flying demons, and a good working chemistry between Keanu Reeves and Rachal Weisz. Overall, you will walk away from Constantine having been entertained as well as glad you stepped into the fictional world of the \\"Hellblazer.\\"<br /><br />There are some weak spots to the film. Keanu Reeves was generally very convining, but had moments (especially when he was smoking cigarettes) where he seemed a little off. There were also some blatant inconsistancies that can leave the audience scratching their collective heads. For example: in the first 45 minutes of Constantine, John Constantine is continuously smoking cigarettes, and we are shown (quite often) the severity of his lung cancer. Then, for seemingly no reason, this character issue is forgotten. There is no hint of cigarettes or lung cancer until one of the last scenes.<br /><br />Despite these odd defects, Constantine is worth viewing.<br /><br />Total Score (out of 100) = 71<br /><br />38 (out of 50). Enjoyment. A rating based on my overall enjoyment of the film.<br />6 (out of 10). Acting. How good was the acting?<br />7 (out of 10). Immersion. Did the movie suck me into the story?<br />7 (out of 10). Intangibles. Special effects. Movie pace. Is the movie forgettable, or something you will talk about and remember for weeks? Years?<br />8 (out of 10). Must see. Is this movie worth seeing/renting?<br />5 (out of 10). Must buy. Is this movie a must buy/purchase?
B000002U82|5.0|If you don't already own this album, you should get it.  It was a milestone when it came out, and it still commands respect.  Not just that, it also is amazing music.  I once saw a Pink Floyd 3D lightshow, and it was AWESOME.  Great music for that sort of thing, and more.  Enjoy!
B00006EXL5|2.0|If you haven't heard this album, you're not missing much. It takes some \\"soul-searching\\" for every band to find a particular style they want to stick to, so you'll often notice that a band's first album is at least slightly different from their third or fourth (if they even survive that long). MCR is by far no exception. I was hardly a slobbering fan over their second album (I'll call it \\"Three Cheers\\" for short, 'cause I'm lazy today), but it wasn't the beating it could've been. A few songs were actually pretty catchy (i.e. 'Helena', 'The Ghost of You', 'Thank You for the Venom', 'Jetset') despite being about as complex as 2+2. \\"Three Cheers\\" wasn't all that bad. All in all, it wouldn't have been one of those albums I'd have regretted buying (if I had bought it).<br /><br />\\"I Brought You My Bullets\\" (again, shortening it because I'm unenlightened), however, is a few pages behind \\"Three Cheers\\" in the book of MCR. Not much of a surprise, right? The album - when it came out in 2002 - didn't propagate much attention; it was just one of those unremarkable things that happened to fall through the cracks in the sidewalk. It happens a lot. \\"Three Cheers\\" boosted its record sales, but had that release not come along, well... Really, \\"I Brought You My Bullets\\" isn't that great of an album (in my humble opinion). Here's my dissection of it:<br /><br />It's not exactly audio-vomit - it's just, well, unsatisfying. Each song will frustrate you by leaving you feeling as though the 5-minute fillerfest you just listened to really had no climax to it at all ('Demolition Lovers', 'Early Sunsets Over Monroeville', 'Vampires Will Never Hurt You', for example - made even more gruelling because they were WAY too long). I honestly can't name one song that didn't bore me to death at some point. That's right. You know how in stories, the plot is supposed to start on an even level and then begin to build up and up and up to one point? These songs never even get off the first step of the stairs. 'Our Lady of Sorrows' was okay, 'Skylines and Turnstiles' was okay, maybe even 'Cubicles', but I sure know that I haven't listened to 'Demolition Lovers' once without being annoyed not only by the pace of the song, but to the point of looking at the Winamp window in frustration only to groan, realizing that there were still at least three minutes or so left to go. Total yawnfest...not all the songs are exceptionally long, but there are a few seriously drawn out ones that will really test your patience. Maybe a hardcore MCR fan could see something special in this album, but I can't. The term \\"empty filler\\" might be a paradoxal phrase, but it definitely applies in this case. Other noteworthy points are that Gerard sounds a bit different (not much of a surprise - James Hetfield himself made me laugh like crazy the first time I heard \\"Kill 'em All\\", and the first time I heard Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\", I thought Dave sounded like a demented munchkin), and the volume of his voice also seems to be moderately lower than all the noise around him - you'll be inclined to turn the music up louder, even though it doesn't help much. All right...is that it? I think it is.<br /><br />All in all, it's okay, but it's by far not something to scream over. It's no \\"Three Cheers\\", either. I never thought I'd ever be saying this, but compared to this album, I actually prefer \\"Three Cheers\\" - that's very, very shocking. But by all means, don't take my opinion for it.e stairs.

B000000OU0|5.0|The Eagles are a kick ass band.  If you don't already own some Eagles, get with the program!  This album is a great place to start.  You long time Eagles fans know what I am talking about.
B00005JCAA|4.0|Sadly, this is the only DVD you can purchase of the most excellent \\"Death Takes a Holiday\\" starring the delectable Fredric March as Death.  Brad Pitt cannot hold a candle to Freddie March.  It should be a crime to tack Fredric March onto a Brad Pitt DVD as if Freddie were a mere afterthought.  On the other hand, if this is the only way I can get DTAH on DVD, then I'll take it!
B00005RFAI|5.0|Pink has got a really special voice.  It is not opera quality, nor is it angelic, but there is something about it that makes you want to hear what she has to say.  There is no shortage of good songs on this album.  If you don't have any Pink, this is a great place to start.
B0007GAERG|5.0|What can I say, Mariah has still got the voice and the music and writing surrounds the Voice is just Pure Amazing ,Brilliant & Joy to listen through the whole album.  No Blemishes here.  Some songs grow on you but, when you listen to the album you get inspire and feel Mariah and her Voice.  For a Comeback Kid-Mariah proves she is Truly a Survivor every sense of the Word.  This is a reflection of her innermost thoughts and talent that match amazing.  A VERY, VERY STRONG COMEBACK.  I must admit I wasn't always in love with Mariah music.  With Maturity and Relentless Focus on her strengths she proves that she Is a Force to Reckon With.  I am happy for Mimi.  By, the way Beyonce is way out of her leaques she can't touch Mariah.  Mariah has the perfect gift Talent along with Amazing Voice and lyrics and music that reflects Maturity.  By, the way my I love each songs.  Especially \\"We Belong Together\\" Simply the Best.    My Favorites Songs Highest Rating 5-1 being the lowest.      1. It's Like That - 5 Stars  2. We Belong Together -   5 Stars - Amazing - I just love this song- G0 Mimi Go!  3. Shake It Off  -  5 Stars - Another Amazing Song - It is Hot!  4. Mine Again   - 4 Stars  5.

I would encourage anyone and everyone to buy this album.  This a Wonderful and Brilliant Lyrics and Vocals to Match.  The songs really reflect a Spirit that is in touch with her innerself and such a Positive way.  No cursing or Explict Lyrics.  Nothing to be ashamed to listen too.   Very Easy listen album.  If you just get \\"We Belong Together\\"  itself is worth it. This album was inspiring to me.    Mariah Rules and Rightfully So!  This Woman got it and some of these young female vocalist can take a lesson from Mariah the One of Few Great Female Vocalist.  Especially Beyonce, Teeari Mari, Destiny Child, just to name a few.   Go Mimi Go !
B000001OAA|5.0|Garbage is a very strong first album.  A great majority of the tracks are good songs.  A bit dark at times.  Definitely worth the money.
0425188809|4.0|This book is outstanding. I loved the little anecdotes and strange behavior of the dog.  It was so well described, I could literally see it in my head as I was reading it.  Koontz expains every character so well, I could identify with each of them, so much so, I was sometimes unsure who I wanted to see succeed.  But in the end, I knew I wanted the dog to win.   <br /> <br />If you love animals, if you can relate at all to dogs, this is a must read.  The behavior of the dog will charm you and wiggle a way into your heart and a smile on your lips.  Many times, I laughed out right.  Beware, though the book jumps around to other characters.  I found myself a little disappointed and wanting more of the life of the dog.  But it is a necessary evil to move the story forward.  <br /> <br />Without giving away the ending, I found myself taking pity on all the characters, including the monstrous ones.  Enjoy.
B0000CAXID|5.0|There are a couple of excellent tracks here.  Some of it is heavier than the rest, which is also good.  The Foo Fighters mix it up a bit.  Nice variety.  A five star effort.

B000002I8D|5.0|In 1981, Phil Collins, lead singer & drummer for the rock band, Gensis, had released his first solo debut album entitled, FACE VALUE. After hearing this album for the first time, I realized that Phil Collins is much better as a solo artist than he is when with Genesis. Don't get me wrong, there are a few songs I like from Genesis, like \\"Invisible Touch\\", \\"In Too Deep\\", \\"No Son Of Mine\\", & \\"Land Of Confusion\\", but Phil Collins had displayed himself to be more talent as a solo artist, and it was proven right here with FACE VALE. <br /> <br />IN THE AIR TONIGHT <br />  This song is my favorite off of this album. Hearing the first 2 and a half to 3 minutes are amazing, and then enter the drums. This is a fresh rock out track with Phil's excellent drumming. This song seems to be the only hit from this album. <br /> <br />THIS MUST BE LOVE <br />  Not a bad song. <br /> <br />BEHIND THE LINES <br />  This song blew me away. This song was actually a Genesis song, with Phil Collins on Lead Vocals, where they had recorded it for the album, DUKE. Here, Phil Collins actually covered his own song, which would be the first, last, & only time Phil Collins would ever cover a Genesis song. <br /> <br />THE ROOF IS LEAKING <br />  Love that piano on this one. A great song. <br /> <br />DRONED <br />  This one starts off with a really strange vibe, but the song heats up and become another great song for Phil off of this album. <br /> <br />HAND IN HAND <br />  This is a really great song. There's just something about it the had me instantly drawn to it. <br /> <br />I MISSED AGAIN <br />  Another great song. <br /> <br />YOU KNOW WHAT I MEAN <br />  This is such a beautiful ballad and I think it set the stages for Phil's future ballads, such as \\"Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)\\", \\"One More Night\\", \\"Separate Lives\\" (Duet with Marilyn Martin), \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\", & his rendition of \\"A Groovy Kind Of Love\\". <br /> <br />THUNDER AND LIGHTNING <br />  Another great song. <br /> <br />I'M NOT MOVING <br />  I love the sound to this one. This is my second favorite song off of this song. <br /> <br />IF LEAVING ME IS EASY <br />  Another beautiful Phil Collins ballad that can't stop listening to. <br /> <br />TOMORROW NEVER KNOWS <br />  Think back to 1966 when The Beatles had recorded their album, REVOLVER. Well, on that album, they had recorded a song entitled, \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\", which had featured Beatles member John Lennon in lead vocals. That song has always been one of my favorite Beatles songs. Phil Collins had decided to cover the song and include it on his first album. Phil had sang this song and had the music sounding very, very close to The Beatles' rendition. He had done it so well that I think that Paul McCartney & Ringo Starr, with the spirits of John Lennon & George Harrison, are more than pleased with it. <br /> <br />    Phil Collins is definitely a legend in the genre of Rock & Roll/Rock. We all know that The Beatles were the real start of Rock & Roll. Phil Collins wanted to prove that he can just as outstanding as The Beatles are. I know The Beatles have long since broken up, but their music still has an impact on us, which is why  I said The Beatles are still popular, not \\"Were Popular\\". Anyway, Phil Collins' first album is just outstanding and you can have your very own copy when buy one from here.

B0009W5JS2|3.0|I won't beleager the plot or the criticism. Watch the film for Dafoe and Jackson and you won't be disappointed.   <br /> <br />These two actors continue to astound me and for their performances alone, \\"State of the Union\\" is at least worth watching once.  Dafoe's portrayal of a meglomaniac Secretary of Defense is one of his best bad boys.  I prefer Vin Diesel as XXX, but Ice Cube did show a little more depth than he did in \\"Barbershop.\\"   <br /> <br />They're planning on getting a different Agent X (according to the script) so Ice Cube probably will not be in the next show.  If they keep Jackson as Gibbons, I think it'll be worth watching.

B00007G207|5.0|This disc has two sides: <br />One contains a sort of director's cut (or something to that effect) in which there are long sequences that did not appear in the original release. Frankly, I think those scenes should have stayed where they belonged: on the floor of the cutting room. <br />On the other side you find the original version intact and more awesomely beautiful and well written then you remember. And definitely a shining star for your movie collection.
B000002J2D|4.0|THIS IS A SURPRISE ! THE SO CALLED \\"THREE PIECE\\" VERSION OF GENESIS IS BORN ! (ACTUALLY IT WAS AT THIS POINT THAT GENESIS REALLY JUST REBECAME A FIVE PIECE AGAIN (AGAIN) FOR LIVE TOURS ...BUT YES...IN THE STUDIO , THEY WERE JUST A THREESOME !) THIS ALBUM IS VERY INVOLVED AND STILL VERY PROG ! THE VERY FIRST TRACK IS A COMPLICATED DIDDY INDEED CALLED 'DOWN AND OUT' THAT SCREWS ALONG IN A VERY DIFFICULT TIME SIGNATURE AND ALMOST FALLS APART BUT NEVER QUITE DOES...THE ABSENSE OF STEVE HACKET IS EVIDENT YET HE IS SOMEHOW NOT MISSED (YET)...GENESIS DOUBTERS AT THE TIME MIGHT HAVE BEEN PLEASED WITH THIS ALBUM WHICH SORT OF SIGNALS 'THE END'...BUT INDEED AS HISTORY PROVED , IT CERTAINLY DID NOT ! THE NEXT ALBUM AFTER THIS \\"DUKE\\" IS ALMOST A GENESIS CLASSIC IF NOT FOR THE REALLY LAME CORPORATE DIRECTION EEKING IN SLOWLY...THIS WHOLE ALBUM IS RATHER ENJOYABLE AND SOMEWHAT OF A SHOCK...ITS REALLY GOOD ! NOT QUITE COMMERCIAL YET AND THE INSTRUMENT PLAYING IS REALLY IN YOUR FACE ESPECIALLY ON BURNING ROPE. BALLAD OF BIG, SCENES FROM A NIGHT'S DREAM AND THE A TRICK OF A TAIL LIKE SNOWBOUND.  I RECOMMEND THIS.
B00005B36H|2.0|This is the kind of record that kids who don't listen to that much music declare \\"the best record of all time,\\" \\"a masterpiece,\\" \\"the most beautiful thing I've ever heard,\\" and other ridiculous hyperboles.  This is really basic (and really boring) progressive metal.<br /><br />Now, if you're a serious music fan, the term \\"progressive metal\\" should've immediately turned you off, because that's just something that shouldn't exist.  Metal should be brutal and badass, like Cryptopsy and Pantera, and prog should sound like Pink Floyd.  Combining the two makes (to borrow a term from Spinal Tap) a complete s**t sandwich.  You get all the shortcomings from both genres and none of the benefits.  Tool sucks!<br /><br />I mean, for God's sake, there's a track called \\"Faaip De Oiad\\" that consists of a bunch of ambient noodling and loud static with a sample of some guy nervously talking about secret government conspiracies to cover up alien encounters.  Wow!  Art!!  There's also plenty of stupid, pointless, noodly \\"interludes,\\" which are quiet and really annoying, but fortunately very short.  I still don't understand why artists feel the need to include \\"interludes\\" anyway; it doesn't help \\"overall album cohesiveness\\" or any crap like that.  It's just annoying.  Call me old-fashioned, but I like SONGS.  I'm not saying they have to be conventional verse-chorus-verse, but I still like to hear REAL SONGS when I'm listening to a record.  Tool is just the kind of band for kids who think bands with noodly interludes and 8-minute songs are automatically more profound and intelligent than anything else.  I don't buy it.  I'll take punk over this jargon any day.<br /><br />To be fair, the lyrics are actually pretty cool, and some of the songs even kinda rip (\\"Ticks and Leeches,\\" \\"Parabola\\"), so it's sort of easy to understand where their rabid fan base comes from.  I also have to respect any popular band willing to take an absolute commercial risk, which this album definitely does.  However, I still wouldn't mind Tool going back to the earlier, heavier, and more song-driven days of Opiate.  That's the record I'd recommend over this overblown mess any day.  Or, even better, pick up some Black Flag, you pseudo-intellectual pansies.<br /><br />Later!However, I still wouldn't mind Tool going back to the earlier, heavier, and more song-driven days of Opiate.

B000002KKS|5.0|ITS HARD TO FIGURE SABBATH OUT SOMETIMES...THE FINAL THREE OZZY SABBATH ALBUMS WERE SHAKEY ESPECIALLY TECHNICAL EXSTICY,..THEY WERE GOOD ALBUMS INDEED BUT NOWHERE NEAR PARANOID AND MASTER...WHEN OZZY LEFT THE BAND, THAT WAS PROBOBLY PRETTY MUCH IT IN THE MINDS OF ALOT OF THE PUBLIC...THEN ALL OF A SUDDEN THEY PUT OUT THIS !!!!  WOW !!! THIS RONNIE JAMES DIO CHARACTER CAN REALLY SING AND THESE SONGS ARE WAY BEYOND ANYTHING SABBATH HAD EVER DONE...THE LYRICS ARE REALLY GOOD...THE BAND WAS TIGHTER THAN EVER AND INFACT, THEY DID NOT SOUND LIKE SABBATH AT ALL' ; THEY WERE MUCH BETTER...MUCH IMPROVED PROBOBLY BECAUSE IN LARGE PART OF EXCELLENT PRODUCER MARTIN BURCH..WHO PRODUCED ALOT OF GOOD RECORDS IN HIS DAY , THIS ALBUM IS AN ABSOLUTE CLASSIC...OZZY MAY BE THE REAL MCCOY FOR SABBATH BUT DIO IS THE SH***...AND EVERYBODY KNOWS IT ! THIS IS A CLASSIC !!
B0006L16N8|5.0|After a few years of waiting, X&Y finally emerge. And i must admit that this is the best album of Coldplay. <br /> <br />Starting by \\"Square One\\", follow by the \\"White Shadows\\", and if you  think this is the best song they have? You're wrong. \\"Fix You\\" will  immediately blow you off and you will be flying like the \\"Speed of Sound\\"-Something you never experienced before. <br /> <br />Lastly, i think THIS is the One- that makes the difference.Must Buy.Recomended.
B000002J09|4.0|This cd is great i would listen to it alot more if only rock radio did not play these songs to death with the exception of four sticks which is quite forgetable. Just listen to classic rock radio if you a fan of this band and save your money because that is all they do on classic rock radio is play led zepplin songs to death. They play other music to death that makes you not want to buy a cd of classic rock becasue you feel like you are getting rip off. Personly i like the songs on albums that were not hits or singles they are more interesting and fresh.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Jack Black and Kyle Gass (Jables and Kage) have formed one of Rock's most awesome bands, and they have named themselves Tenacious D. I have been a fan of the D for years but only recently have I purchased this CD and it was a long time overdue.<br /><br />When it's not rockin' my socks of, it's splitting my sides. This album contains songs like \\"Karate\\", \\"Explosivo\\" and the singles \\"Wonderboy\\" and \\"Tribute\\". These songs will be stuck in your head, demanding that you put in the CD one more time so you can listen to those songs again. They also show that they can have a rockin' ballad \\"Friendship\\".<br /><br />The funniest song on here is track 6 \\"FHG\\" and the funniest skit on here is by far track 19 \\"Drive-Thru\\". It's easy to see why this album made it into Spin Magazine's top 40 albums list. This is great music with comedy added in-between. You're doing an injustice to yourself by not picking up this record.<br /><br />True, the D ain't for everyone, but the sweet thing is that it's probably for you. There's no denying Mr. Jack Black's Rock status after listening to this record, the D aren't just funny, but they are full fledge Rock Gods with catchy tunes that will have you rockin' for years to come.<br /><br />It's an addiction to which there is no cure
B0001LJC2K|3.0|Of course people compare this band to radiohead it does sound like b sides to the bends but acutally the b sides to the bends are alot better and more interesting. This singer needs to know that there are more singers out there than Jeff Buckley and Tom Yorke. The music all sounds the same with the pounding of the piano and guitars. It seems to me that the piano player on this cd just does not know how to play the dam thing with the exception of butterflies and hurricanes i like the piano interlude it sounds like liberace. So if this band does not want to be think of as a radiohead clone they should experiment more and try to develop a sound that is all there own i know that can be hard. Come on really is there any band out today that sounds original or different from what is on the radio. I would sell this cd on amazon but it is not worth munch with the cost of the bubble mailer and shipping the dam thing it is just not worth it.
B000268QB2|2.0|When i listen to this cd i can picture some male figureskater skating to it. I am a fan of skating and i know what they skate to and it sounds very similar to this. This is music for people who think Coldplay is too edgey and for people who want something a tinny bit more edgey than Josh Gorban. I heard from somewhere that the singer had to take some breaths in a oxygen max after singing the song bend and break how lame it is not like the song is Judas Priest song. I bought this cd because it was like 6 dollars and i tend to like dudes who sound like chicks the singer has a innocent type voice like Nick Drake but drake was a good songwriter that even when he wrote corny lyrics you really do not care becasue his music is good and he performed his songs well. This band does not write good lyrics and there songs all sound the same it is like listenting to a 40 plus minute song. Long story short who cares if you have a good singing voice which this singer does if your songs suck. Actually i rather listen to Bob Dylan crappy voice but a great songwriter.
B000000OAN|3.0|I have this the two best of's classic queen, greatest hits and news of the world the only reason i have these cds is because of freddy mecury's voice. The one big complanit about queens lps is that freddy does not sing lead on all the songs. Brian May is ok he sounds like a weaker freddy but Rodger Taylors voice blows he sounds like a crappy version of Rob Halford to bad the song I'm in love me my car would be good if Freddy sang it. I really only remeber like 3 songs on this the two that everyone has heard a millon times of rock radio and love of my life which is so pretty. Manily i like the fact that this band can rock but i tend to like the ballads even the chessey ballads from the 80s that this band did well maybe except the song miracle and It's a kind of magic. Long story short would anyone like this band if it was not for Freddy Mecury he is the band Queen.
B00026W82U|3.0|I bought this becasue i heard good things about it and it was compared to nick drake, simon and garnfunckel and i really like folk music. This is a pleasent cd very relaxing but very dull. I really cant remeber any songs from this it all sounds the same. For one thing the duos voices is very evenilly match unlike simon and garnfucnkle when one had the better voice then the other one and it blended well together. if you like this music try out belle and sebastain the songs are good and a rareity now of days in music the lyrics are very good as well.
B00005JM4Z|4.0|This was a cool and action packed film. I loved the car racing and intense fight scenes, as well as the hot babes and strong men. It also had some funny parts, and I liked the final fight with the big boat and car and gun thing. It had plenty of swears, and of course lots of cool and colorful cars. Guns, too. I liked this movie a lot  not just because of that, but also because it showed the importance  of teamwork and friendship. Anyone who likes racing, fighting, or both should see this movie. It's well worth the money you'll spend.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|Even though I loved the first XXX, I loved this one even more! I mean, what can I say? There is more fighting, shooting, and cursing  which by the way is all more intense than the first one, Ice Cube plays one of the best heroes ever, and there are quotes, like in the first, that are cool, funny, or both. Plus, Willem Dafoe, the guy who played my # 1 favorite Spidey villain, the Green Goblin, & therefore is one of my favorite actors, was in it, too! I give the first XXX a 9 out of 10. I give this one a 10 out of 10, and I just  so highly think that anyone who liked the first should see this one without a moment's thought or hesitation. End of story.
B00008H2LB|1.0|Up to 1995 the Rock musis in general was awesome. Then one day you and another gay-ass fakers like you (Limp Bizkit, Blink182, Good Charlotte, Creed and etc.) came and ruined it, arn't yo ashamed?! Many morons tell me you are so talented, but there is no one talented in your band but that nerd that sits all the day on the computer and mixes your bad music. BTW DJ in a rock band?!?! What the f**k?!?! Anyway the vocals are awful and sound like rap (This Mix of rock and rap sucks), The guitarist  espcially sucks, did he ever took guitar lessons?? He always play the same chords and he plays only in the choruses. Oh yeah.. the bass, I found that he knows to play only 4 sounds on his bass guitar, he repeats the on every song.    BTW since you made a discrace to the rock music and rap music, the best thing you can do is to get on the 10th floor of a building and jump (Without Parachute!!) Please do it, I and a lot of people will be soooooooo happy. THANK YOU    (...)
006072448X|5.0|Undoubtedly, the best piece of fiction I have read in many a year. Wrenching, intelligent, emotional and frightening all at the same time.
B00003CX8N|5.0|When I received my copy of the DVD I was at first dismayed to realize it was not a Widescreen edition.  Then I discovered that a panned-and-scanned edition is all that is available.  On further thought, considering that the film is essentially Bancroft and Hopkins talking to each other through the mail, the absence of sweeping panoramas isn't a fatal flaw.   <br /> <br />As a book lover, this film is one of my all-time favorites.  The joy of reading, touching, smelling finely bound and printed texts comes palpably through the screen.  If you love books you must see this film. <br /> <br />
B00006G8G1|5.0|Now that's a real live Metal DVD! Obviously Iron Maiden's not your fly-by-night 80's head-baggin' rockers, they lived and breathe Metal and more to come for sure. This release includes some serious new tracks that sounded like classics. The live recording's great, it captured every instrument that was played, down to the niftiest rhythm guitar parts, not to mention Bruce Dickinson's soaring octaves on \\"Run To The Hills\\"!
B00005JL0I|5.0|This is by no means the typical Bond, James Bond movie. Even though it is only in name the same as an Ian Fleming book, it is a zany comedy. It is an absolute riot to watch. The cast includes such notables as David Niven, Peter Sellers, and Woody Allen. Fans of the off the wall comedies of the Sixties and Seventies should love it. In fact fans of the Austin Powers movies should enjoy it too. A nice mixture of comedy and action. Will the real James Bond please stand up? Good quality DVD but nothing special about extras. Well worth the price. A must have for any fan of the James Bond movies, that know what a parody is and how it is considered a comedy. I have seen people actually review this like it was suppose to be the normal serious Bond movie.
B00006LI4S|4.0|Gilmour delivers in this setting with great acoustic with a little electric thrown in renditions of classic songs. Even after all these years he can still sing Fat Old Sun pretty close to the album version. He sounded great and to the reviewer who comented on his appearence since when was Pink Floyd's music judged on looks and not merits. Such comments reminded me when people comented on David's greasy hair. The music matters here and David Gimour in concert delivers. Shine on.
0735619670|5.0|I would recommend this book for beginning programmers and software engineers as well as for anyone in the field who wants a set of standards and guidelines. This is a good book to have as part of a team to establish good coding practices and procedures.
B00003CXAA|5.0|I must say I love these movies (even the 3rd installment, yes). These are the ultimate mafia movies and anyone should have a copy of this box in their collection. From the awesome performances of Al Pacino in the entire saga, to the memorable Marlon Brando character of Don Vito Corleone as well as a very memorable Robert de Niro (among a whole cast of great actors and actresses), you live the life of the Corleone family. And, on top of that, you get shootings, plotting, betrayal, italian wedding humming tunes, unforgetable quotes... (very) Long story short, get this and you won't regret it! :)
B0009IW98O|5.0|SMOKIN' O.P.'S presents a side of Bob Seger that many people might not know. On this CD, all but the last two songs are written by other people, and Seger has a sound much more rooted in the 60s than the one we've come to know. Still, this is a great album, and the fact that it was reissued just as Seger was advocating sanctions against Indonesia for that country's trumped-up drug-smuggling conviction of a young Australian tourist is as good a reason to buy this CD as are his great covers of such compositions as \\"Hummingbird\\" and his own \\"Heavy Music.\\"

B000060P79|5.0|The music and songs are upbeat and GREAT! They seem to appeal most to kids in the age range of eleven to fourteen. I borrowed it form a freind and instantly fell in love with it. I say BUY IT! The songs seem to actually target teens and pre-teens by giving them songs they can easily relate to. This is a great CD and I think all adolescents should get one. BUY IT NOW!!!

THEY INSPIRE YOU LIKE RELIGION AND YOU HUNGER FOR MORE...THE GREATEST ROCK AND ROLL BAND ON THE PLANET !
B0002OERI0|4.0|Reading a lot of the reviews remind me of when I was a teen and thought that anyone who listened to stuff that was played on the radio was shallow and stupid.     Kiss was for people who didn't understand music. Cool people listened to the Ramones and X and the Clash and the Pretenders. And don't get me started about Fleetwood Mac or the Eagles.    Now that I'm 41 I still think those albums are great and get them out every now and then. But I also listen to the Eagles and Fleetwood Mac as well. I realize that just because something is popular does not mean it is not good.     This is a very good album. Very good. I don't listen to a lot of bands anymore. The most contemporary CDs that I have are Coldplay, Dave Mathews, and Dishwalla. I was beginning to think I was too old to appreciate modern music. But I like this album. I like it a lot. I think these guys are all very talented. The lyrics, the melodies, and the playing are all spectacular.    This album is a classic in the vein of Dark Side of the Moon, Rumours, Physical Graffiti, Cosmos Factory, and London Calling. This album will be listened to 20 years from now.     A lot of you guys who are too cool to listen to this album will be listening to it 20 years from now as well.    Trust me.    BTW, something else you wont care about 20 years from now is debating whether this is punk, pop, or blue grass. To me, it sounds more like a cross between the Ramones and the Who. I guess that makes them psychidellic-quasi-punk-pop-garage. Anyone who disagrees is a complete moron.    You people crack me up.

B00005BKZJ|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be good, but it turned out to defy my expectations and was terrific.  Two apparently different women meet, transform each other's lives and form a strong relationship based on their similarities.  I laughed out loud and sympathized with Jasmin and Brenda, although I have to admit that it wasn't until a full 60 minutes had passed that I began to warm to Brenda. <br /> <br />Anyways, you will enjoy this movie, which says something about the interconnectedness of human beings, no matter how superficially we appear to be miles apart.  And let's not forget the beautiful song, \\"Calling You\\", which I had on tape but never knew it was from this great movie.

B000A1KY7I|5.0|This is one of the best and most creative films ever made. Totally inventive in concept, the story revolves around an exuberant and romantic Italian man named Guido, who also happens to be Jewish. He sweeps the woman of his dreams,his \\"Principessa\\", off her feet. They marry and have an adorable little boy whom they dearly love. Unfortunately, this all happens during World War II in fascist Italy.<br /><br />Ultimately, Guido and their son are whisked away to a concentration/work camp on their young son's birthday. Meanwhile, his wife and the boy's mother, coming home and expecting to find a birthday celebration in progress, discovers, instead, that the inevitable has occurred. She tracks them down to the train that is taking prisoners to a work camp and, after confirming that they are on board, insists upon boarding the train herself, so that she may remain close to them. They see her board the train and know that she is with them.<br /><br />In order to get his son through this horror as best he can, Guido tells his son that they are involved in a real life game to win a tank, knowing that the boy had wanted a toy tank for his birthday. Talk about a reality survival game! In any case, his son is young enough to fall for it and gets with the program as only the very young can. What follows is a series of inventive scenarios which tells the viewer of the lengths that the father goes in order to keep his son quiet, obedient, entertained, and safe from harm. All along, the father has his son believing in the game and playing to win, to the point that the boy believes that they are actually in first place to win the tank.<br /><br />While this may sound like an odd venue in which to find oneself laughing, that is exactly what the viewer does. At the same time, the film is achingly poignant, and the end is infinitely sad. Guido is played to perfection by comedic star and filmmaker Roberto Benigni, who also directed this masterpiece. His on screen wife and comedic foil is played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying. It is simply a great movie. Bravo!played by his real life main squeeze, Nicoletta Braschi. The son is played with wondrous innocence by the totally adorable Giorgio Cantarini. This is an award caliber film that saw Benigni deservedly capture Oscars for Best Actor and Best Foreign Language Film.<br /><br />All in all, this film will leave the viewer both laughing and crying. It is simply a great movie. Bravo!

B000002KYR|5.0|Eliminator(1983). ZZ Top's Ninth Album.<br /><br />In 1983, ZZ Top was beginning to slide back into mainstream popularity, as their previous albums, 'Deguello' and 'Tejas', had both gone platinum. When 'Eliminator' arrived, the album instantly rocketed to the top of the charts, thanks to the massively popular music videos \\"Legs\\" and \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\". Thanks to MTV, 'Eliminator' became ZZ Top's best-selling album, and it remains a rock classic to this day. To this day, \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\", \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\", \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\", \\"I Need You Tonight\\", and \\"Legs\\" are all rotated constantly on the radio. So, do I think this album lives up to the hype? Read on to find out!<br /><br />After 'Eliminator', ZZ Top became less and less of a rock band and more of a pop band, but here they managed to create the perfect balance. ZZ Top made an album that still retained the bluesy, gritty rock sound that they're known for, but managed to appeal to almost everybody. ZZ Top is a very percussive band, and Frank Beard's drumming is truly amazing here. On almost every song, I found myself tapping my feet to the beat... truly, he did an amazing job here. Billy Gibbons guitar work here is spectacular! He can make catchy power chords one second, and rip out a bluesy solo the next. He truly is a great rock n' roll guitarist.<br /><br />From the dirty, boozy rock of \\"Gimme All Your Lovin\\" and \\"Legs\\" to the blues of \\"I Got The Six\\" and \\"TV Dinners\\", ZZ Top kept me interested. While all the hits are instant classics, \\"Sharp Dressed Man\\" is the absolute best ZZ Top song, basically defining and rewriting the definition of \\"cool\\". \\"I Need You Tonight\\" is ZZ Top's strongest ballad, a percussive, guitar-laden classic that never gets boring, unlike some of their later material. \\"Legs\\" is the most identifiable song on 'Eliminator', a song that would be the beginning of ZZ Top blending synthesizers more and more into their music, but still stands out as one of their best. \\"Got Me Under Pressure\\" is sort of a dark view of peer pressure that contains some of Billy Gibbons' best guitar work. While the later half of the album is not nearly as good as the first half, it still can hold it's own. \\"Thug\\" is a very smooth, cool song that has some funky slap bass and great drumming. \\"TV Dinners\\" is a rather repetitive blues song, but Gibbons' guitar work is very inspired here. \\"Dirty Dog\\", \\"If I Could Only Flag Her Down\\", and \\"Bad Girl\\" are all bluesy rockers that any ZZ Top fan can identify with.<br /><br />What's to say? 'Eliminator' is one of those albums that never gets old. The first half of this album is flawless, a perfect example of what blues-rock should sound like. ZZ Top would never be this good again, and 'Eliminator' remains a very powerful album to this day. Although maybe not my favorite ZZ Top album, it's hard to say it's not. A very well-produced and cohesive record, the band sounds fantastic and the songwriting is clever and imaginative. Please, don't claim you have a complete classic rock album unless you have this classic.<br /><br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED TO FANS OF ZZ TOP, BLUES, ROCK, AND 80'S MUSIC! ZZ TOPS' LAST GREAT ALBUM...

0156027321|5.0|Although some readers have found this book to be too \\"far-fetched\\" or not \\"believeable\\", I believe the point of the entire book was completely missed. The book took readers on a journey that may or may not have been real, but that's not the point. The point is that Pi got from here to there and had to deal with loss, confusion, isolation, etc, before reaching the safety of land. The point is not which story of his you believe, but that, like religion, basically each one leads to the same ending. I found this book incredibally original and inspiring as well as spiritually awakening. It's a book that I would recommend to anyone who has the ability to be open-minded.
B00080ZG10|2.0|I rented this because i like old hollywood and i heard it was good boy was i wrong. This movie is well made and directed well it should be it sure cost a lot to make but it is rather dull. I kept thinking as i watch this movie that the actors playing the real life people do not look or act like the person they are playing. Some of the story is wrong like that Ava Gardner stuck by him after he cheated on her that was wrong Ava never did that she never put up with any crap her men did to her. Actually i am not a Leo fan but he was good in it considering he looks to much like a sissy to play Howard Hughes. The Howard Hughes story is very interesting but you be better of watching a good documantary which this 2 cd set comes with. One more thing i am sick and tired of Miramax promoting boring movies to death for oscar consideration. All of these movies are forgetable the only one that people like and remeber today is Pulp Fiction. Thankfully the Oscars came to there senses and this movie did not win best picture or director, just becasue scoresse is a great director that has not won before that does not mean he deserves it for this movie which is probably one of his worst. And by the way Millon Dollar baby deserved to win best picture it is very moveing and well acted and made and stays with you long after you seen it i cant say that to this movie.
B000002H97|5.0|The \\"black album\\", in my opinion, is a \\"new life\\" for Metallica. Their previous cds were all thrown into the speed/thrash metal category, while this more rock (not easy to mosh to.) It has been said that Metallica worked too hard on this cd, but I think thats bull! There are at least 5 greastest hits on this cd and the others are just as good. Ok, the drumming isnt as fast as Lars' previous stuff but its not like Phill Rudd's basic crap either. The many guitar solos are amazing and the catchy, sing-along lyrics are awesome! Like justice Jason only helps out with one song on this one (my friend of misery) but its a great song. Nothing else matters is one of their best slower songs and had a sweet solo. Sad But True is probably the heaviest song on the cd and awesome. Dont tread on me, the struggle within, through the never, holier than thou, and of wolf and man are the fastest songs on the cd and very fun to listen to and jump around to! Enter Sandman and the Unforgiven are outstanding. The God that failed is somewhat confusing but very heavy and a sweet song. This cd still has its sweet solos, its pounding drums, James' growling voice, and the bobbing bass so it can only get a 10!!! Just buy it
B00000ILDF|4.0|Overall, I liked this movie. There was a lot of supsense, blood, & fighting, just like the first two, and I liked the way Ellen Ripley sacrificed herself so no one else would be attacked by Aliens. It was a noble and gallant thing for her to do. I also liked the many times the other crew members swore at each other, and the final and deciding fight with the final Alien. The reason it doesn't get 5 stars is because though it was good all in all, there was too much chit-chat and not enough intensity and battle. But it was still a pretty good movie. It gets 7 points out of 10. If you are bored and  have nothing to do, rent and watch this film.
B000002H33|5.0|I had this cd burned for me by a friend and when I listened to it I wished had had bought it sooner! MUCH SOONER! Master of Puppets is an 8-track cd and is as fast and as heavy as metal gets. From beginning to end this cd kicks huge butt and has the Big-4 at the helm. At first the Black album was my favorite cd, but when I heard this the tables turned. Battery has an insane acoustic intro that leads into pounding drums and riffs through the entire song. It is extremely fast, heavy, and a great mosher. The solos are outstanding and the vocals are driving. Master of puppets is an 8:30 or so song that never gets boring and never dies down. After 3:30 the song gets very slow and you cant even tell its the same song (thats a good thing!) Its very heavy and also a great song to mosh to. The thing that should not Be is also a great song. It isnt as fast as the two previous ones but it sure is heavy and a great Metallica hit. The lyrics are hard to understand but very cool at that. Sanitarium is probably the best song on the cd. It has an amazing intro and never stops as this slower but heavy song gets going. It makes you want to burn down all insane asylums for Metallica! Disposable Heroes is a fast, long, and outstandingly talented song by Metallcia! It is my favorite song on the cd and is very controlling. Leper Messiah is also a great song. It isnt fast, it isnt catchy, but its heavy and has a sweet solo! Bow to Leper Messiah! Orion is the worst song on the whole cd! This 8 minute instrumental is nowhere near as cool as The call of ktulu or To Live is To Die. It starts off really good but then goes into a stupid \\"space-like\\" song that is nauseating. Dont let the 1:00 intro to Damage inc fool you into thinking that this is a stupid song. It is very heavy and fast. Lars has alot of sweet drum parts in here and the lyrics are awesome! OBEY YOUR MASTER AND BUY THIS WORK OF ART FROM METALLICA!
0895260131|5.0|Spencer has outlined and compiled the most comprehensive primer on Islam - easily digestible by those new to the study of politics and Islam. <br /> <br />My only concern is not the content of the book but the lack of publicity to the fact that many retail outlets (esp B and N) <br />DO NOT display the book on the 'new release' or 'best seller'  <br />racks but hidden away in either 'religion' or 'politics' racks! <br /> <br />
0553213105|5.0|While any book as widely lauded as this one will also find its detractors, especially from among the ranks of students forced to read it, it is worth noting the number of reviewers (count me among them) who cite PRIDE AND PREJUDICE as their favorite work of literature. I love this book and have read it more times than any other work of fiction.<br /><br />For me the greatest pleasure comes from savoring the many colorful characters, not only Elizabeth Bennet and Mr. Darcy, who surpass even Shakespeare's Benedick and Beatrice as the thinking person's ideal romantic match, but also Miss Bingley, Mr. and Mrs. Bennet, Mr. Collins and all the others. Austen employs the vices and virtues of this cast of characters to great effect -- for comedy, drama, suspense, and especially dramatic irony. Individual scenes that come to mind are Elizabeth's rejection of her first marriage proposal, one of the most memorable comic scenes in English literature, and her rejection of a second offer of marriage, a scene that may very well prompt the reader to shout at the heroine in a futile attempt to intervene.<br /><br />With each re-reading I discover more to understand and love about PRIDE AND PREJUDICE. Not only do the individual characters serve as foils to each other, but relationships between characters serve as foils to other relationships. On first reading, I saw how much love and respect there exists between Elizabeth and her father. I saw how similar Mr. Darcy is to Mr. Bennet and understood the perfectness of a match between Darcy and Elizabeth.  On subsequent readings I discovered that Miss Bingley, who is so critical and so mocking of the Bennetts' humble position in society, is more like Mrs. Bennett than any other character, and a chapter in which Darcy seems to arrive at this conclusion himself came alive for me, and I now recognize it as a pivotal moment in the story whereas previously it had seemed like a duller chapter to skim over.<br /><br />All of this sounds very dry and intellectual I suppose, but the experience of reading the novel is anything but. What propels the reader through the book is the apprehension that Elizabeth and Darcy have gotten off on the wrong foot, and while at odds are clearly made for each other in every possible respect. This tension makes it a highly enjoyable page-turner. Nor is PRIDE AND PREJUDICE a fluffy romance novel or a \\"chick flick.\\" Given the economic realities of the times, Elizabeth is risking not only spinsterhood but also economic disaster by not seizing on opportunities to marry any man with a decent income or place in society. By refusing to settle, Elizabeth is a very brave character in her own arena, and for that reason we recognize her as a hero, a noble soul who honors responsibilties, stands fearless in the face of snobbery and oppression, laughs at folly (while exhibiting some of her own as well), and aches for true love. Who cannot root for such a character or rejoice at the happy conclusion of her quest?
B0007GAEW6|2.0|It's no secret that At The Drive-In ruled (especially their swansong Relationship Of Command), and that The Mars Volta were clearly the more inspired of the two bands that evolved from its demise. With Cedric Bixler's wild vocals and obtuse conceptual lyrics, Omar Rodriguez-Lopez's Latin/jazz-inspired guitarwork and songwriting, and the guiding hand of producer Rick Rubin 2003's Deloused In The Comatorium was truly a great album, and showed this outfit going places.<br /><br />And the direction and drive that was a hallmark of their last record is rarely to be found here.<br /><br />It's not that the sophomore Mars Volta release is a BAD album; when Frances The Mute cooks, it REALLY cooks. The opener Cygnus... Vismund Cygnus tears out of the gates with an awesome prog-metal verve, full of jazzy time changes and a strong performance by both Cedric and Omar. L'Via L'Viaquez brings the band's Latin vibe to the fore with bilingual lyrics (still just as inscrutable and cryptic as before) and driving salsa rhythms. Also notable are the added jazz instrumentation (including Flea of The Red Hot Chili Peppers on trumpet--w00t!) on Miranda That Ghost Just Isn't Holy Anymore and Jon Theodore's amazing drumming.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the band's self-indulgence has become way over-the-top on this release. For every bit of good and geniunely rocking music, you have to suffer through a half-arsed Tangerine Dream-esque \\"ambient soundscape\\" (read: pointless noodling) or a disjointed Omar solo. For example, radio single The Widow is only 3 minutes of ballad accompanied by several minutes of pointless and tacked-on ambience that fails to serve the song, and the weirdly tracked, tiring behemoth of an epic Cassandra Gemini could've been cut down to about half its half-hour span. Methinks Rubin contributed a sense of direction to Deloused that the band sorely misses here. The rambling reminds me of Yes, and that's never good.<br /><br />I'll give Frances The Mute points for taking risks. Not many bands have the cojones to write 10+ minute songs on only their second album, nevermind a Cassandra Gemini. The Mars Volta are ambitious and clearly very talented, but Frances The Mute can't overcome its lack of coherence. Buy Deloused In The Comatorium and Tremulant first; leave this one to the fans.for taking risks.

B0002XVQNU|3.0|Make no mistakes, the director's cut is geared towards fans of the first version and will not win any converts.  Although a lot of additional scenes have been added, the characters are still not fleshed out enough and the plot holes remain unanswered. <br /> <br />But the biggest cause for disappointment is the horrible video transfer.  On a regular 4:3 TV, the encoding problems are not as noticeable, but viewed on a widescreen television in anamorphic, the heavy pixelation or blurred pixels become distracting.  With so many dark scenes and fast action, the bitrate should have been increased, or a better encoding method used.
B0000025F7|5.0|The 70s was chock full of brilliant albums released; `Songs in the key of life' and 'Innervisions' by Stevie Wonder, `What's going on' and 'Let's get it on' by Marvin Gaye, `Bad Girls' and `Once upon a time' by Donna Summer, `Parallel lines' by Blondie and the `Grease' soundtrack to name a few.<br /><br />Add Michael Jackson's `Off the wall' to that elite list.<br /><br />Michael's first proper solo album, showing his coming of age as a singer, dancer and songwriter. Where he started his trick of multiple layers of his vocals, as well as his hiccups and yelps. Oh, and those white socks!<br /><br />This was the first album by a solo act to have 4 top ten US hits; `Don't stop till you get enough' and `Rock with you' (both #1's) and `Off the wall' and `She's out of my life' (both #10's).<br /><br />Right from the foldaway cover of the original vinyl LP showing a smiling, tuxedo wearing MJ against a wall, you knew you were in for a great time!<br /><br />The opening Grammy winning track `Don't stop till you get enough' (penned by MJ) is an energetic, percussion rich R&B/dance number, with Michael singing in falsetto. In a similar vein is `Workin' day and night' (also self penned) which to me is just as good. These songs are in a similar vein to The Jacksons `Shake your body' and Michael's upcoming `Wanna be startin' something'.<br /><br />`Rock with you' is more mellow, a Rod Temperton penned track. Brandy has done a cover.<br /><br />Title track `Off the wall' (again penned by Temperton) is a delightful disco number, very catchy with beautiful backing vocals.<br /><br />`Girlfriend' is a midtempo pop/dance track written for Michael by Paul McCartney.<br /><br />The tender piano/string ballad `She's out of my life' features a very passionate delivery from MJ. In interviews I read at the time of release, he said he was so moved, he cried at the end of the song.<br /><br />`I can't help it' is a delicate dreamy sounding mid tempo Stevie Wonder composition. Beautiful! Sampled by Mary J Blige on `Sexy' from her 'Mary' album.<br /><br />`It's the falling in love' is a beautiful mid tempo duet with Patti Austin. At the time this album came out, I was a kid and didn't know for years there were 2 people on this song. Their voices blend too well.<br /><br />Produced by Quincy Jones, the album went on to sell 8 million copies in the US alone.

B00005A46T|1.0|I don't even know where to begin, so I'm just going to fire away blindly:<br /><br />- completely standard guitar riffs and nothing new or great sounding<br /><br />- lyrics as boring as hell that are actually about nothing at all if you think about it (seriously people, if you want aggessive or deep lyirics try Krieg or Behemoth or something)<br /><br />- boring and standard drumming (best drummer? BEST DRUMMER?? what is the matter with you people?? 1 word: CRYPTOPSY)<br /><br />- don't say I should stop comparing slipknot to \\"my\\" kind of metal, I'm just comparing real music to... eh... lesser music<br /><br />- anyone thinking that Slipknots guitars are great and talented should consider the fact that they play in open tuning (aka drop, something that real metal guitar players (like me) will  ALLWAYS avoid, cause if you don't, you don't deserve the title guitar player (unless you play in Rammstein, but that's industrial hard rock anyway))<br /><br />- now for a friendly word of advice, stop listening to slipknot, hang around at a lot of metal forums (the more underground ones) and you will behold the light<br /><br />- now face that slipknot is a weak excuse for metal, slipknot is not metal, slipknot is some mtv sponsored clown act with stuff to make music they can't even handle properly<br /><br />enough, if you're not willing to listen to me after this, you deserve to remain and rot in your crappy hot topic dump
B000002N3N|5.0|What an enchanting collection this is. I fell in love with Enya's music right from her first hit `Orinocco flow' and have been a fan ever since.<br /><br />Enya's haunting and ethereal voice, coupled with rich, magical musical arrangements, layered dreamy sounding backing vocals, and lyrics sung in English, Latin, and Gaelic, set her aside form all other new age artists.<br /><br />Opening track `Memory of trees' is a beautiful instrumental with angelic voices flitting in and out.<br /><br />`Anywhere is' has an upbeat tempo, cutting strings, lush instrumentation, and poetic lyrics.<br /><br />`Tea-house moon' is an instrumental with a Chinese sound. Magical keyboards (I think) set against a delicate backdrop. Beautiful! Just as delicate is `La So&ntilde;adora' with very ethereal vocals against a gently brooding soundscape. Then there's the tender piano instrumental `From where I am'.<br /><br />`Pax deorum' (sung in latin) will have you checking to see you're not in a monastery. Very religious sounding!<br /><br />The absolute standout has got to be `Athair ar nearmh' (sung in Gaelic). This song is stunning! Angelic vocals, delicate piano, with delicate strings sweeping in and out. Mournful sounding but outstanding!<br /><br />A magical, delicate, angelic experience!
B00001QEE8|5.0|This was the last Disney movie in which Walt himself participated directly. This is one of those movies you can watch once and again, and never ger tired of, the type of movie Disney stopped making after \\"The Lion King\\". The story is very simple, but highly enjoyable nonetheless, and the characters are so well defined and have so much personality that they are extremely easy to relate with. Funny how almost anyone you ask will side with either Baloo or Bagheera, depending on their personality.<br /><br />\\"The Jungle Book\\" wasn't one that I grew up watching, but I LOVE it every time my son, my wife and I sit down and enjoy it together. If you haven't seen it, you should.

Ramotswe's detective agency was the only agency in town until another agency owned by a man who had CID experience in Johannesburg and New York showed up and threathened their business.

Makutsi, hoping to earn extra money set up the Kalahari Typing School for Men, which became a hit.<br /><br />I have enjoyed the other books in this series and this was equally delightful. The author focused more on the main characters' daily lives and their problems as opposed to actual cases. It's great that the readers get to learn more about the characters but at the same time, it would be better if the author had provided more cases for Mma. Ramotswe and her assistant to solve. Nevetheless, this is still a great book; it's easy to read, the characters are likeable and it's basically a fun read.

B00006JU7T|4.0|\\"Serpico\\" is the true story of a New York City cop who refused to join his colleagues on the force and accept bribes and kickbacks.  Serpico was so disgusted by the way in which the system was corrupt, that he decided to do something about it.  This meant he had to risk his own well-being as roughly 85% of the police force in NY was crooked. <br /> <br />This movie is really entertaining because of how real it feels.  THe actors are no-names and the scenary is very raw and all shot on location.  Director Sidney Lumet portrays the police oficers as regular people and does not get into any shoot-outs or truly heroic moments that so many other cop films depict.  There are no car chases and there are no true moments of valor in this film, unless you count Serpico's epic battle to bring the whole corrupt system to an end. <br /> <br />Al Pacino's performance in this film is fabulous and is very convincing.   <br /> <br />This is a really entertaining movie about a man who believed in his ideals of honesty, dignity and trust and is inspirational in the sense that it makes the viewer want to act on their ideals in the same way. <br /> <br />
B00005JNEI|4.0|****1/2<br /><br />When Michael Moore`s controversial documentary \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" was released in the summer of 2004, it hit a readiness reaction with a large segment of the American public, people who found themselves increasingly dissatisfied with the direction the country was taking under the Bush administration and who believed that, in this film, someone for the first time was finally giving voice, in a mass media outlet, to their deepest held fears and concerns.  Let's face it; no fiction writer could have concocted a more bizarre and surrealistic series of events than what actually occurred in the United States in the first few years of this millennium:  a contested Presidential election followed by a terrorist attack of unprecedented proportions followed by a \\"retaliatory\\" war aimed at the wrong country and based almost entirely on faulty intelligence.  These three incidents converged to create a near \\"perfect storm\\" for Moore's documentary.  It also didn't hurt, from a commercial point of view, that the film was released in the heat of a bruising Presidential campaign, one in which the stakes never seemed higher for both ends of the political spectrum in the country.  The 2004 Presidential election would be a fight to the death, one whose motto was clearly: may the better ideology win.<br /><br />Well, it has been a year since Moore's film hit the streets and almost as long a time since Bush won reelection for a second term as president.  The question to be asked now is, with the passions on both sides cooled down to at least some extent (or are they?), how does \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" play in a post-election world?  The answer is pretty damn well actually, mainly because most of the issues Moore raises are still as valid after the election as they were before (mainly because Bush WAS reelected).<br /><br />Moore is, of course, an unapologetic liberal and a self-appointed gadfly for the powers-that-be in our society.  As such, he aims his sights directly at the Bush administration and all those who support it.  He starts off brilliantly by recalling the horrors of 9/11 in a unique way: showing us a black screen while the sounds of the planes crashing into the buildings are heard on the soundtrack.  With memories of that horror still lingering in our heads, Moore then proceeds to expose the Bush family's long standing connections with the Saudi royal family, a fact that few people seemed aware of before this film was released.  Moore then goes on to criticize the way in which the Bush administration has exploited the \\"War on Terror\\" for maximum political effectiveness, culminating in the Patriot Act which, he argues, has had a draconian impact on the civil rights of ordinary American citizens.<br /><br />But the greatest part of Moore's wrath is saved for the second half of the film, when he confronts what he sees as the wholly unjustifiable war in Iraq.  Moore is to be given credit for being one of the first and only people to have shown us actual on-the-ground pictures of the death and carnage that occurred in that country immediately after the initial bombings.  Watching these gruesome images, we are immediately struck by just how antiseptic the media's coverage of the war has been here in the United States - a fact that Moore blames not only on the Bush administration but on a press that has allowed itself to become little more than an extension of the rah-rah, war-rallying propaganda machine set up by the government (a government, for instance, that refused to allow any pictures to be taken of flag-draped coffins coming back from the war zone).<br /><br />The section dealing with the Iraq War is the most emotionally devastating section of the film, mainly because Moore is able to bring it home to us personally through the ordinary individuals who have been most directly affected by it - soldiers on the field, amputees in the hospital and, most heartbreakingly, the mother of a boy killed in a helicopter crash in April,2003.  Her unbearable grief, so nakedly exposed on camera for all to see, becomes an emblem for a war that not only need not have happened, but has, as Moore points out in various ways, been largely bought and paid for with the blood of brave men and women from the lower, underprivileged tier of society.  He ends his film by confronting a number of congressmen who voted for the war but who seem reluctant to send their own children over to do the actual fighting.  Actually, there is so much going on in this film that it becomes virtually impossible to convey even half of it in a short review such as this one.<br /><br />As with his previous films, Moore once again proves himself the master of facile irony, pointing out, in darkly humorous fashion, the absurd inconsistencies and blatant hypocrisies that abound in the world around us.  These moments are what keep Moore's films from becoming dry-as-dust jeremiads against what he sees as a corrupt system.  He makes us laugh even when we know we should be crying, but this is the way a polemicist reaches his audience.  And no one understands that better than Michael Moore.<br /><br />Is the film \\"fair,\\" \\"balanced,\\" \\"nonpartisan\\" in its approach?  Absolutely not.  Does it need to be?  Well, I can certainly see where people of the opposite political persuasion might find themselves wanting to yell back at the screen or lob a few well chosen projectiles where they feel it would do the most good.  And that's fine too.  After all, it's a free country and the Bush supporters have every right to launch their own rebuttal against this film if they so choose.  I would truly love to see it.  But until that time both liberals and conservatives will have to be content with kicking the set every time \\"Fahrenheit 9/11\\" is appearing on the screen.  The funny thing is that they'll be doing so for entirely different reasons.ter crash in April, 2003.

2266144340|5.0|I could not put this book down.  And every time I had too, I couldn't wait to get back to where I left off.  Because I didn't want to miss any details.<br />This book was great.  It had all the things that make a great thriller of a novel -- a great plot, gripping details, intrigue, and it moved at a pace where it was comfortable enough for the reader to keep track of what was happening.<br />If you enjoy mystery novels of all kinds, and love a &quot;Bourne Identity&quot; type of plot, than this novel is an absolute must read.  Your collection would be incomplete without it.
B00008973A|3.0|The musical on stage was perfect in every way, however, due to the fact that it did not have a main character (everyone in the show gets their own division of small, but equal, spotlight), it did not appeal to everyone.  So they changed it around a bit and made the story behind Zach and Cassie center-ring in this circus.  And because so, the movie had lost much of it's appeal.  It still is a good story, but a true fan of A Chorus Line will find this movie disappointing.
B00005JN2Z|4.0|Michael Mann has a unique directorial style that seduces the viewer into casual interest in the characters, then sucks us into the building suspense till we can't escape. Jamie Foxx's portrayal of Max, the cabbie, is first-rate as an unassuming likeable, honest guy, while Cruise's portrayal of Vincent is a more accurate depiction of his real-life persona than the average fan would easily decipher. I especially enjoyed Jada Pinkett-Smith's portrayal of a prosecutor, underplayed by the fast-moving script, but seemingly perfectly appropriate for the plot shifts. The average viewer with any ethical sensibility would easily root for Max, caught in a whirlwind of Vincent's profit-centered crimes. Without spoiling the suspense, suffice to say IMHO that this film presents Tom Cruise as his true self, the role he was born to play, particularly as such a hell-bent advocate of the Scientology cult, whose raison d'etre revolves around profit and power for its own sake, and literally to Hell with anyone who would dare attempt to stop them, including the U.S. federal government. Cruise's Vincent is a sheer mercenary, a role that L. Ron Hubbard would relish in watching one of his own disciples portraying, wishing that he, Hubbard himself, had been talented enough to be assigned such a role in a feature film, rather than remaining a mediocre con-man throughout his life, founding a capitalist cult rooted in Satanism a la Aleister Crowley, his personal mentor. If not for the risk of spoiling the film, I would specify my favorite scene, but I wish no personal harm to anyone as depicted therein. Just beware of Scientology, since your life truly depends on it. Don't fall for their Satanic scam! I look forward to watching Jamie Foxx in similar roles in the future, even if only defeating Scientology by fictitious implication.
0765301598|3.0|The Battle of Corrin is the final book in the prequel trilogy by Brian Herbert & Kevin Anderson.  Overall, the book fits in well with the other books in the series.  However, the book has a huge amount of ground to tie up all the plot lines introduced in the other two books.  The conclusion to the various major plotlines are fairly predictable but written with sufficent detail and style to make it worth reading. <br /> <br />The background material on folding space, Bene Gesserit (sp?) and hatred between the Atreides and the Harkonnens are interesting.  I liked the way the Luddite religious extremists are done; a nice social commentary on blind faith combined with a lack of knowledge or thought.  It has an interesting perspective when considered with the recent events in Iraq. <br /> <br />The book is a fairly quick read and worth it if you enjoy the Dune Galaxy.
0895260131|5.0|Islam as an ideology is every bit as evil as Nazism or Communism, make no mistake about it.  That is certainly not to say that Muslim people as a whole are bad, because the vast majority would just as soon live their own lives and be left alone.  But, from its very inception the Islamic way has been coversion by the sword.  Robert Spencer points out that there is no equivalent of the \\"Golden Rule\\" that you find in every other major religion.  Everything done in the name of Islam is acceptable, to include lying, killing, and stealing.   <br /> <br />For those Islamic apologists that say we are taking all of the Koran's and the hadith verses out of context when it comes to conversion to Islam, how do they explain Islamic treatment of women?  Spencer points out in this book just how vile of treatment is allowed toward women. <br /> <br />America, and Europe, though it may be too late for them, needs to wake up and stop buying into this idea that Islam is a \\"religion of peace\\" as our president so PCly put it after 9-11.
B0001XAPZ6|2.0|I rented this movie. Thank God I didn't buy it. The story sounded like it was written by an eight year old. It was long and boring at times. If you would like to see a better one I would suggest my neighbor totoro, spirited away, kiki's delivery service, and the cat returns. These are far better graphics, and great story plots. If you want to waste your time and money then watch it!

B00003CXRM|5.0|This film passes almost like a dream - if dreams were spiked with slapstick humor.  It evokes, more powerfully than anything I have ever seen, the essence of an America that is no more.  Which is both a good and a bad thing. <br /> <br />It's a good thing because no one in their right mind would want to go back to the era before the Civil Rights Movement changed the face of the south and put old Jim Crow to rest. <br /> <br />It's a bad thing because television, air conditioning and sealed up cars have basically ended society, and left us with a thin, fragile shell of a community.   <br /> <br />In 1930's America, there was nothing to do on a hot summer night but sit on the front porch, drink lemonade, and talk with your neighbors who were out walking, looking for a breeze.   <br /> <br />On Saturday, there was nothing to do but go into town with your children and see everyone out walking around downtown, going from store to store on the sidewalk (imagine that...) <br /> <br />On Sunday, you went to the church of your choice, where you tried to worship the Lord over the rustling sound of whispered gossip, some of it about you and yours. <br /> <br />It was a socially tight, often restrictive world; but it was a world that was focused and centered around people relating to each other; not around gameboys, X-boxes, PC's, cellphone IM's, or sitting alone in your house on a beautiful summer night with all the windows down tight, the AC on full blast and the TV making that flickering, eerie blue light in your curtains. <br /> <br />\\"Oh Brother Where Art Thou\\" reminds us both of what we are so glad is over, and of what almost all of us miss on some subconscious level in our hearts; the feeling of being a part of a community.
B000002H97|5.0|Most fans think Metallica joined the mainstream with this, their 1991 self-titled album. But, if you look further back into the band's history, I think they inched closer towards the mainstream with their 1986 landmark, \\"Master of Puppets.\\" Since it went multi-platinum and had several hit singles, that album definitely made heavy metal more accessible. Plus, their next album, 1989's \\"...And Justice for All,\\" featured a song (\\"One\\") that was the first music video Metallica ever made. So, this C.D. (\\"The Black Album\\") may have shorter songs and slower song tempos, but I don't think this album was Metallica's first mainstream move. Plus, these songs may be shorter, but they are still, on average, five minutes long.<br /><br />This C.D. is, from front to back, great and nearly flawless. It features some of Metallica's best songwriting and some of James' and Kirk's best riffs. Every song on here is a hit, and nearly as good as the one that came before it. Granted, there are about as many fast songs as there are tunes which are mid-tempo or even slow, but those slower songs don't kill the album's momentum.<br /><br />1. \\"Enter Sandman\\" is the first of five hit singles, here. This song is one of Metallica's best of all time, and the intro, which is quite long, features one of the best and catchiest riffs of all time. The music fades in at the beginning and, as another reviewer said, when this song kicks into high gear, you know this is going a great record. The riff is ascending, chugging, occasionally wah-wah-ing, and, around three minutes in, there's a very cool guitar solo which is trademark Kirk. But with lyrics like \\"Sleep with one eye open\\" and \\"If I die before I wake...,\\" there's sort of a dark vibe to this song.<br />2. \\"Sad But True\\" is also very catchy, partially due to some good vocal hooks. It also has lurching-almost grinding-riffs.<br />3. \\"Holier than Thou\\" opens with a riff which is much speedier than the track that came before it. Also included is a thumping beat and a two part guitar solo.<br />4. \\"Unforgiven\\" has a very laid back tempo, some soft singing, and even a few acoustic strums.<br />5. \\"Wherever I May Roam\\" has another slow beginning, but then Lars gives his drums a good thumping and the actual song begins. This song is kind of repetitive, but it's another up-tempo `Tallica tune, with a great, long, guitar solo that flares up.<br />6. \\"Don't Tread on Me\\" is similar to track two, \\"Sad But True.\\" It's stop-start riffs create a very rhythmic beat, and (like track two) it also has a guitar solo. (But this solo is much better; it both ascends and descends.)<br />7. \\"Through the Never\\" has very catchy and fast chugging and churning riffs, with a good give and take between the guitars and drums. This song occasionally becomes a bobbing/slow skipping beat.<br />8. \\"Nothing Else Matters\\" is a semi ballad. It doesn't have any riffs, and the guitar picking is so soft, it almost sounds acoustic. This song's lyrics and mood are so depressing and slow, some audience members actually hug when Metallica play this song in concert.<br />9. \\"Of Wolf and Man\\" begins with bobbing, pounding riffs. This song-like this album-is full of great hooks (both musical and vocal).<br />10. \\"God that Failed\\" has more grooving guitars and another guitar solo. (This one is the best solo on the album; it has four parts to it.)<br />11. \\"My Friend of Misery\\" doesn't really present anything new to the album, but there's a slow tempo change around the four minute mark, and three wailing guitar solos are also included (the first two are rather short, but the third one is great.)<br />12. \\"Struggle Within\\" begins with a drum beat that sounds like an Irish parade or a marching band or something. The fast, moderately heavy chugging guitars kick in, and the rhythm becomes a toe-tapper. One last, fast, guitar solo (with several parts to it) also highlights this track, and the song (and the album) end with a pounding rhythm.<br /><br />So, \\"The BlackAlbum\\" may be somewhat more commercial and mainstream, but it is another perfect Metallica disc which stands up to classic metal albums like Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid,\\" Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" To those of you who thought Cliff Burton was Metallica's brains and talent, you obviously haven't heard this, because if you don't like this album, you don't like good heavy metal! And if you are a heavy metal fan, you should buy this album... then, if you have enough money left, buy food, water, shelter, and clothes.another perfect Metallica disc which stands up to classic metal albums like Black Sabbath's \\"Paranoid,\\" Metallica's \\"Master of Puppets,\\" and Pantera's \\"Vulgar Display of Power.\\" To those of you who thought Cliff Burton was Metallica's brains and talent, you obviously haven't heard this, because if you don't like this album, you don't like good heavy metal!

B00024ZAWM|4.0|I'm a big fan of great guitar albums and this one is no exception.  The guitar work on \\"Walk this Way\\" is just fabulous. Perry and Whitford's other work on the rest of the album is great too.  \\"Sweet Emotion\\" is another classic track while the title track is a great opener to the album.<br /><br />Why just 4 stars?  Well, other than the 3 songs just mentioned, I thought the album was pretty short at less than 40 minutes for one and the album didn't flow quite as well for my liking.<br /><br />Indeed, the dreaded word 'filler' comes to mind for at least a couple of the tracks.  But this miniature LP cardboard case remastered version of the album is just great!  The improvement on the sound is very obvious and I just love the cool look of the cover.<br /><br />I started years back with the cassette and then the cd but I've worn them all out. I'm glad I got this Japanese cardboard cover version though.  You will too....
0784011176|5.0|The Piano is a heavy drama that is filled with splendid performances and an awesome score.  Holly Hunter deservedly received the Oscar for her convincing portrayal of Ada.  Ada floating above her piano at the bottom of the dark and silent sea is quite haunting and peaceful to see.  Attached to her piano by the rope around her foot, the blue of the water is glowing deep and light, everything is barely visible, only dark shadows with her, the piano, a few fish and some swaying vegetation.
B00006LI26|4.0|Surely , this was Helloween's heaviest album where there were more   negative lyrics.  Kai Hansen,(Gamma Ray's leader today) if you don't know,he was the man who helped give name for this band , but the main idea  came from Ingo Schiwchtenberg ( dead drummer now ).  He was a guitarist and lead singer in this work. Many people say that  he didn't sing so well.   Yes, his deep voice wasn't so developed if we compare  it to his tuning in Gamma Ray ballads ( Farewell from Land of the free;  Pray from Somewhere out in space for instance)  There were more trebles.  However, he mantained his singing style in this cd in away that doesn't  harm. Hard rock vocalists have no obligation to be so tuned.  The exception is in \\"Starlight\\", where he was pretty flat:  1-\\"But a junkie was something to beEEeeEEeeEEeee!\\"  2- \\"StAAaarlieeghtt!\\"    Starlight talks about a tramp buddy that uses drugs and lives in a fantasy   world. At the start,we can hear him swaping radio stations . He finds  that Halloween song: \\"Happy , happy halloween, halloween,halloween...\\"  A burp is heard, Hansen shrieks \\"AAAAAAAHHHHH\\" and the rock starts.      The drums are the same in these tracks : Murderer, Guardians , Metal invaders  Heavy metal is the law , Judas, How many tears?, Cry for freedom   Ignore this and appreciate the guitar work:   Hansen doesn't make the same number of distortions like in Keeper of the seven keys  but does the job well with his pal, Michael Weikath.  My favourite songs that are 10/10:    Ride the sky - Here's where Kai sings better. This part has a beautiful  melody: \\" Set me free,ooooooh set me free; Send me a sign,wanna leave it all behind... Rearrange the masterplan,  take the future in my hands, to be free and not trapped anymoooore\\"  There's a pleasant harmony solo (The two guitars together at same note)  in the midway.    Gorgar - This piece is funny. The lyrics show the evils of getting addicted to  videogames and spending all money in arcades. Weikath plays a horror filmsolo too.  The chorus makes me laugh : Gorgar will eat you , Gooorgaarr (the others singing in  back, to show that the pinball moster is frightening).  The monster states in the end: TILT!!    Warrior - What a strong sentence: \\"Your prayers won't be heard, so die!\\"  Kai sings it almost shouting, but it's good. The guitaring is fast.    Guardians - Another of the best melodies.    Phantoms of death - It describes the heartless and dangerous people in general  (The phantoms of death). My favourite guitar solos are here; when the beat  changes and in the bridge (Something like Te -leinleinleinleinleinleinleinleinleinlaloum)    My evaluation of the others:  Starlight- 7,5/10  ; Murderer- 9/10 , Cry for freedom- 9.5/10  Victim of fate - 8/10 ; Reptile - 6/10 ; Metal invaders - 8.5/10  Heavy metal is the law - 7/10 (metal can't be beaten by any dynasty,according to Kai)  ; Judas- 8/10  How many tears? - 6/10    Don't afraid to buy it, its rock and roll won't be so bad as you may think.
B000AARKW6|5.0|The first collaboration between director Brian De Palma and Al Pacino since Scarface, Carlito's Way boasts one of the best performances to ever be captured from legendary actor Pacino.  The storyline can be summed up as a \\"what if Tony Montana wanted to go straight\\" kind of deal, and it works exceptionally. When Carlito (Pacino) is released from prison at the beginning of the film, he vows to go straight and forever leave behind his criminal past.  He dreams of retiring to the islands with his estranged girlfriend (Penelope Ann Miller), but that's easier said than done as he finds that not many people can leave a life of crime behind alive, and his loyalties may prove to be his undoing.  Carlito's Way is one of De Palma's best films, riding on Pacino's shoulders as he gives a knockout performance, while Sean Penn is perfectly cast as his sleaze ball lawyer.  All in all, if you've never seen this film, I strongly recommend it, and seeing a modern day acting legend like Pacino give his best is enough reason to see this.

B00025ETIW|5.0|This is the best CD Ive purchased in a long time.  Absolutely every song is awesome.  It hasn't been out of my CD player in a month and a half.  This band is the most original thing out there - nothing at all that Ive listen to/purchased within the last SEVERAL years even holds a candle to this CD.  If you buy it and like it, I would suggest buying their first CD (I Brought You My Bullets, You Brought Me Your Love). And they are great live.  Alot of energy!
B000096I9G|5.0|Many reviewers here complain about the boring visuals, the subtle differences in arrangements, and the mix of the songs on this DVD. Bottom line (there's that dreaded bottom line again )this is ESSENTIAL viewing/listening experience of the Cure. The live set of Pornography blows the studio version  completely out of the water ( listen to the live versions of these songs on the recent reissue of Pornography and tell me I'm wrong). The Disintegration set is faithful to a fault - I was in Atlanta for the Prayer Tour in 1990 - and I don't hear anything out of place or off key ( as others are saying ) in the performance or the mix. As for the Bloodflowers set, I didn't see the shows, but I can assure anyone on the fence that the live versions here  are quite on par with the studio versions. Overall, this is a real treat for Cure fans, the sound mix  is fantastic, the visuals are subtle but very effective, and the experience as a whole is the next best thing to \\"being there.\\" Sure, some songs are performed slower than the original studio versions, some a bit faster, but that's what makes a concert. Enough said. Buy it. Five stars, absolutely.
0385720920|3.0|Palahniuk extends his shocking tendencies a bit too far with this novel.  The writing is unnecessarily lude, although he is known for that.  I had to crawl through this book at times, it was difficult to finish, and the ending was certainly not that impressive.  His religious symbolism is overrated and a reach. Sorry Chuck, I've read better from you!
0767830555|5.0|The masterpiece \\"Taxi Driver\\" tells the tragic story of a certain Travis Bickle, an ex-Marine who gets a night job as cabby driver to while away his sleepless nights. His lonely work makes him aware of an array of bizarre and vicious characters, and he feels the urgent need of a big rain that would wash away \\"all this scum\\", like a deluge. Living an aimless life, he comes across a woman, Betsy, that stands out in the wasteland of the big city as a promise of redemption. But his best hopes are disappointed by the revulsion Betsy feels for his strange ways. In his quest for a meaningful life, he turns to a young prostitute, tries to rescue her, and finally plays the avenger of outraged innocense in the bloody end of the story, which is not for every taste. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is about loneliness, the sense of purity which it breeds, and the desire to chastise the corrupt world, embodied in the \\"low life pimp\\" that Bickle hates so much. The blood bath at the end seems to stand for a purifying ritual. I utterly agree with those who consider the very end of the story, so incongruent with the rest, as Bickle's delirium in the verge of death. The mood of self-justification is only too obvious and fits perfectly with the character. \\"Taxi Driver\\" is a movie to be studied, one of the finest examples of cinematic art.
B00005R2IS|4.0|Mad Max is a interesting little piece of movie history. While the script isn't all that compelling and the movie itself is obviously in the low budget arena Mad Max still stands out. Why? Because the movie for one doesn't try to be more than what it is. It's about fast moving vehicles and the heroes/villians who ride them. Move just a step above that and you get character development from both sides. Not much beyond that, but again the movie doesn't pretend to have more.  <br /> <br />This is Mel Gibson's first starring movie role and he took the world by storm. This movie was a perfect vehicle to launch Mel's career. It gave him a chance to play the hansome hero with a full range of emotions (which he pulls off quite well). If it weren't for Gibson this movie wouldn't be anywhere near as good. Sure you get some good supporting actors, but lets face it. This movie is about Max, and Max has to carry the story.  <br /> <br />The supporting cast for Mel isn't just the actors, but the vehicles as well. The police in this destopic future ride in fast interceptor cars. The bad guys are a nomad bike gang riding in various motor bikes. Max gets a really sweet car that becomes his trademark in not just this movie but the sequel as well. The cars definitely have character and the way they are filmed shows it. The chase scenes are fast and furious. No speeding up the cameras  to make it look fast here. This is the sort of excitement the movie excels at.  <br /> <br />My only complaint is that Mad Max ends up just being a series of events that happen one after the other. The tie ins are sparse and the script is weak because of it. Then again this isn't Gone with the Wind. Still I have to at least mention it.  <br /> <br />This DVD is a must have for any MM fans. Not only do you get the American released english version, but you also get the original Australian dub. Of the two the original comes out on top. Not because the \\"American\\" dub is bad. It's actually pretty good in thesense that the voice actors did a good job of it. The problem is the American version was done in mono and you don't get nearly as much environmental sounds and background noises as you do in the original. Also the Aussie dub is in stereo, which beats out mono anyday.  <br /> <br />The DVD also comes with a couple featurettes that really hit home for the fans. One is more about Gibson and one is more about the movie. Both are very informative documentaries. I think even longstanding fans of Mad Max would find some new info in these.  <br /> <br />To be honest Mad Max is not for everyone. If you demand blockbuster budget Hollywood style movies this isn't it. If you demand high art or deep stories you won't get it here either. However if you can get into a low budget movie that did one heck of a job in the car chasing department or are a fan of Mel Gibson then this is the movie for you.
006441034X|5.0|I approached Howl's Moving Castle with a little bit of skepticism.  It had been a long time since I had read any \\"young adult\\" books, and I worried about the quality of the writing and the story.  Plus, this was my first Diana Wynne Jones book.  Turns out all my fears were misplaced.  Howl's Moving Castle, like Jones' other works, is pure magic.  The characters glow with a life and truth that is lacking in many other \\"adult\\" novels.  The story is at once gripping and hilarious, moving and light-hearted.   <br /> <br />Howl is the true star of this story.  His self-absorbed personality and overly-sensitive antics are absolutely brilliant.    <br /> <br />Classic.
B00005JO9J|5.0|Not being a huge fan of medical shows and working all night in a hospital, I think that Grey's Anatomy, not only shows the dynamics of relationships between interns and residents, but eachother as well.  I work graveyard shifts and usually have to tape it to see it when I get home.  I love the way the show was done.  A great look into the life of relationships, stress, and how to deal with everyday life.
0440180295|5.0|I wonder whether this book would be published today. It is funny without being cynical or sarcastic. It is an anti-war novel that manages to avoid being preachy or heavy-handed. It is like a perfectly balanced house of cards or souffle, any more or any less would bring the whole thing crashing down.  It is one of those books that makes you feel like the author is a close, personal friend. <br /> <br />By now, you probably know the plot.  Billy Pilgrim lives his life in out-of-sequence snippets that include alien abductions, marriage and career, and a naughty picture of a woman with a horse. But, of course, all roads lead to Dresden. This is ultimately, a book about the author's experiences as a POW during the Allied fire bombing of the German city (I'm not sure, but I suspect that the term \\"fire bombing\\" was coined for this particular massacre). <br /> <br />There are two ways to read this book.  You can read it literally so that Billy was really unstuck in time, kidnapped by aliens, and displayed in an inter-planetary zoo.  Or the book can be intrepreted as the attempts of an unhinged man to cope with his experience in one of the most horrific (but ignored) events in human history. Either way, the story will both break your heart and make you smile.  <br /> <br />One of the key themes is perspective.  The truth and the way one feels about the truth can change depending on the angle at which things are viewed.  Particularly if one is a Tralfamadorian. <br /> <br />One of the best things about this book is the writing style.  Vonnegut's easy-going, straight-ahead style is the key to this book.  Both the author and the protagonist manage to avoid inserting their opinions about the unfolding events.  Instead, they let the facts of the story speak for themselves.  The horrors of Dresden are all the more horrific when stated matter-of-factly.  Billy Pilgrim is a very passive character.  He seldom initiates action, but, instead, responds to events as they unfold. This isthe role that just about all us are stuck with when it comes to global events like war, time, and fate. <br /> <br />In a way, this book reminded me of Steinbeck's Monterey trilogy.  The plot, characters, and themes of the Slaughterhouse Five have nothing in common with those of Cannary Row.  But in each case, there is an unapologetic love of humanity that bubbles through the pages.  That is something that one finds only in the work of the best author's and the best people.
0062502182|5.0|I just had to post here because I am recently reading a book called Dope by Robert J. Escandon that is in part, a very similar story to the Alchemist. The Alchemist is such a great story that it has influenced many authors and readers alike to think about life differently. The alchemist shows and tells us, of a very aggressive world, where hope is still found and irony is completely drenching everything around us. This book is simply good, a very good read for anyone. Now, to my next portion of this review. Anyone that likes the Alchemist will love Dope written by Robert J. Escandon. I wante to share this with everyone because i never post on Amazon, but just had to do it once i read a couple of Chapters of Dope. Pick it up and read it, it's one of the best books you';ll ever read.
B000002H6C|2.0|Yes, the recording is great even years later and the songwriting is Metallica's most complex but there isnt a trace, snouch, thump or fizz of a bass guitar anywhere on this album. It's nonexsistent!!! Hopefully they'll remaster \\"And Justice For All\\" and fix the bass guitar once and for all...
0895260131|5.0|This is quite a book. It is divided into three sections, of which I found the first to be the most interestiing. This part, simply titled Islam is about 120 pages and uses quotes from the Qur'an to illustrate his contention that Islam is a very militant war-like religion.     Being a skeptic, and not very familiar with the Qur'an I went to my favorite on line card catalog of free books on the web - [...]and went looking for a copy of the Qur'an to see if he was at least quoting it correctly. I didn't check every reference, but the ones I did check he was quoting absolutely correctly. Specifically he used the Picthal translation.     This part of the book is pretty scary. While he has deliberately inflamatory sections of the Qur'an to discuss, it seems that a bunch of the radical Islamic folk have picked the same sections to justify their actions. This doesn't bode well for the future.     The second section of the book is on the Crusades. He says that the Crusades are being used as justification for some of the more radical elements. I suspect that this is true. He says that the politically correct people in the US are picking up on this and using it to blame us for the whole thing. They forget that the forces of Islam took over Spain, sacked Rome, etc. etc. Yes, a thousand years ago there was a lot of fighting. But there is little we can do about that today. If the extremists want to justify their actions based on events from that long ago, there is nothing we can do about it.     The last section in the book, only about fifty pages long is on today's Jihad. All I can say is that it's damn scary.
B00005JMXX|1.0|This one is so politically correct they even recycled the plot.  If the director had spent as much time developing the story as he did on the special effects, it might have been worth more than one star.  As it is, I'd have given it zero, but that's not an option here. <br /> <br />I haven't laughed so much at a disaster flick since \\"Armageddon\\".
B000002GYR|5.0|This work is somewhat unusual for Mr. Waits, and undoubtedly many people will prefer his more raucous and experimental works, but for my money Closing Time is his best album by far.  Not a bad song or wrong note on the entire album.  Sad, plaintive, sweet, nostalgic, warm, not what you normally associate with Mr. Waits, but the kind of music you can listen to alone when you are depressed and lonely (not that that ever happens to me), or when you are with someone and you feel like something quiet and mellow.<br /><br />In the hopeless love ballad \\"I Hope that I don't Fall in Love with You\\" the narrator is trying hard not to, but....  In \\"Old Shoes (& Picture Postcards) it is time to go and he is leaving \\"the girl with the sun in her eyes\\" for the road, and the song makes me wanna cry (or it would if I weren't so damn macho).  It is one of the most beautiful songs anyone has ever sung.  Mr. Waits is not trying to be funny here.  He's not trying to bend the conventions, or make a musical statement beyond just good, plain, unadorned sweet and lovely singing, and some magnificent accompaniment.  The final song is instrumental and the perfect close for a perfect album.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|The bulk of these reviews consist of people saying how this album is bad because of the lack of screaming, due to M. Shadows' injury.  They obviously cant sound like they used to, and contrary to most people's opinions, i like this album much better than the other records.   <br /> <br />All in all, this is not a diehard A7X fan's album.  If you didnt like the excessive screaming in Waking The Fallen, or the apparent lack of solos, then you will probably like this album.  For metalheads and punkers alike, I highly reccomend this album.
B00005JN0T|4.0|In 1940, Issac Asimov wrote I, Robot.  I, Robot was a series of short stories about the Three Laws of Robotics.  The movie version of \\"I, Robot\\" does a good job of updating the stories.  Del Spooner is a detective that hates robots, and he is called to solve a mystery surrounding U.S.R.  I would like to think that Asimov would like this movie.  However, look at what happend to Robert A. Heinlein  on \\"Destintion Moon\\"
B0009A1AS2|5.0|These Walls - The most mainstream, quickly ear-catching song on the album.  The first one I latched onto and listened to until I burned out.    Octavarium - A long, amazing listen with some strange flower-child throwback sounds    Root of all evil, Panic Attack, Never Enough - have a very interesting Baroque quality, with some strange voice effects and spooky rhythm and lyrics.  Very enjoyable to listen to.    The other two tracks, I didn't much care for:    Answer lies within - Accoustic, but not too melodic.  Interesting lyrics, but flat musically.  Actually rather boring.    I walk Beside You - Not sure what this song is about, perhaps a strange attempt at radio-esque music.  Actually, I really like the verse and bridge - The chorus really just doesn't fit.
0393317552|5.0|This book did for me exactly what the author hoped it would: took my racist* world-view and gave me a compelling alternative explanation that has now replaced it.   <br /> <br />Previous reviewers on this site seem to be criticizing the thesis of \\"geography as destiny.\\"  Maybe there is room to debate about whether some individuals or cultures have themselves been (or are, or will be) the ultimate agents of some long-term changes in the story of humanity.  But you can't deny that facts such as that black Africans had hardly any domesticatable crop species and no domesticable large animal species go a long way towards explaining why they never produced the kind of agricultural surpluses required to start conquering white people, rather than vice-versa.  For all I knew before reading Guns, Germs & Steel, black Africans were sitting on as many agricultural resources as white Europeans but simply never developed them to a fuller potential. <br /> <br />Other reviewers have criticized bias in the book, citing as examples Diamond's positive statements about some native persons.  Nevertheless, Diamond has an avalanche of data to support his arguments.  Maybe he has a bias, but, if so, it sure is an educated one with a huge and impressive collection of empirical support. <br /> <br />Another critic said that Diamond's book is nothing new.  Diamond is the first to say in his book that all human contributions and innovations build on the work of others.  To Diamond and his publisher's credit, it is this book that reached my layperson eyes, was written in an accessible and convincing way, and changed my world-view. <br /> <br />I recall other detractors saying the book was repetitive.  This is true sometimes, but it seems to stem from Diamond approaching his investigation from multiple perspectives in differently themed chapters.  The repetition reinforces the main points and also allows people who don't want to read all 400 pages to select a single chapter and nonetheless obtain a good picture of how the topic of that chapter supports Diamond's thesis. <br /> <br />For such a marvelous, world-view changing achievement, I cannot believe how many people have lined up to take a swing!  In my eyes, their criticisms pale in comparison to the fact that I started the book as a racist and finished it as someone who knows better and can now tell my children and others about it.   <br /> <br />*I thought the differences in how history has and is turning out for persons of different colors had to do mostly with cultural or genetic differences between the people themselves.  I am no longer so terribly unenlightened.
B00006RINF|5.0|Of all the bands in this arena, I have found that Lacuna Coil has a sound that is unique.  The musical deversity is perhaps the Italian nature of the band.  Missing is some of the American radio frendly production, and that can be a good thing.  The American band Evanescence is good, and has done well for a debue album,  but Lacuna Coil has already demonstrated more staying power.  All 4 albums are works of art, and show a musical style that has been handcrafted over time.
B0000DD7LC|4.0|If you like soulful music and true singing get this album. Alicia keys is truly talented and she will continue to be a driving force in female R&B.
0385336810|4.0|As I stated in the title of this review, I am a little disappointed with Can You Keep A Secret?.  I am a huge fan of the Shopoholic Series, but Secret? was too similar for my tastes.  It is always a good, fun read.  Kinsella's characters cannot be beat, I would love to have any of them in my repetoire of friends, but new material/storyline would be great.  On that note, I love Kinsella's new book Undomestic Goddess - had me on the hook and loving the story unfold the entire time.
B0000027I6|2.0|Roger Waters... a awesome singer/songwriter, dont get me wrong but this album \\"Amused to Death\\" is far from what I expected from Roger Waters. The thing that annoys me the most from this cd is the background singers, boring lyrics besides a couple songs, I mean when I listen to this cd I dont hear the same Roger Waters I grew to like, and when I listen to this cd it just makes me think of how this wouldve sounded if Roger was still in Pink Floyd and how all of the creative talents couldve made a true masterpiece. This album is no comparison to the Wall or anything from Pink Floyd.
0385338686|5.0|I am a big fan of the Shopoholic series, but by Shopoholic & Sister the stories were getting repetitive, Undomestic Goddess is fresh and great!  I read in it the span of 12 hours.  I couldn't sleep until I finished it the very same day I bought it.  The new characters and storyline and funny way that life flows in Kinsella's books are clever and creative and almost impossible to refute.  It is a perfect summer read and I would highly recommend to friends. (I've already lent my copy to one friend and promised it to another!)
B000002J1U|5.0|This got a lot of heat in it's day but I think it's better than Led Zeppelin II: <br /> <br />Immigrant Song 10/10 <br /> <br />Friends 10/10 <br /> <br />Celebration Day 10/10 <br /> <br />Since I've Been Loving You 11/10 <br /> <br />Out On The Tiles 9/10 <br /> <br />Gallows Pole 8/10 <br /> <br />Tangerine 9/10 <br /> <br />That's The Way 9/10 <br /> <br />Bron-Y-Aur Stomp 8/10 <br /> <br />Hats Off To (Roy) Harper 7/10 <br /> <br />You should definitely get this but not before all the other Led Zeppelin albums
B00025ETIW|5.0|Like most people who like to embrace the dark side of life from time to time, I like to use great music as a soundtrack. Mostly this has consisted of Joy Division, Zeromancer, the Sex Pistols, and HIM. Thank goodness I have discovered MKR, most importantly, this new release. <br /> <br />  If you love the above bands, go for this CD! You will not be disappointed! <br /> <br />

B000000OQF|5.0|Apetite for destruction is amongst the greatest rock albums to come out of the eighties.This fantastic album contains anthems like paradise city and sweet child of mine.hugely recommended.
B000002J03|5.0|First of all, this is actually my least favorite Zeppelin album, even than Presence (I don't include Coda becaue those are ouuttakes). The deal is... <br /> <br />Whole Lotta Love 10/10 ok the best on the album <br /> <br />What Is and What Should Never Be 8/10 I never dug this song much <br /> <br />The Lemon Song 9/10 While outstanding work on the bass it's the same thing as Whole Lotta Love, blues riff. <br /> <br />Thank You 8/10 Sounds like the beatles (which is good when you have a case of Beatlemania but when you don't it's tiring) <br /> <br />Heartbreaker 9/10 Great guitar work but still sounds like Whole Lotta Love <br /> <br />Livin Lovin Maid 7/10 Heartbreaker without the amazing guitar work <br /> <br />Ramble On 10/10 This song is genius I will give you that <br /> <br />Moby Dick 8/10 While the beginning is just awesome the drum solo is tiring <br /> <br />Bring It On Home 10/10 This is just great <br /> <br /> <br />See?? Led Zeppelin is amazing. Even the worst IMO is better than anyone else's best. The problem with this album was lack of variation, which was Presence's problem. It was also rushed, Presence's other problem. This one doesnt have an epic masterpiece surrounded with beauty as Presence does (Achilles' Last Stand). Presence was underrated cuz of Physical Graffiti's shadow. Though I prefer Led Zeppelin to Physical Graffiti, it didn't cast a shadow cuz it was a single and a debut. <br /> <br />Still, get this. I think you should get the fourth, Houses, Graffiti, and Out Door first though.
0345475674|5.0|There is a genre of books that adopts one tiny idea, some very narrow topic, and makes it entirely its own. Pompeii does this for the subject of waterworks in the Roman Empire. From this unpromising subject grows one of the most fascinating books about Rome that I have ever read. The masterstroke is to combine a wealth of minutia and esoteric detail about waterworks with the broad canvas of Pompeii just before and during the eruption of Mt Vesuvius in 79 AD. The result is a moving story of love, courage and extraordinary dedication to duty against the magnificent backdrop of the eruption, populated by historical characters like the Plinys (Younger and Elder) among others. The best parallel is the one with James Cameron's Oscar winning Titanic. What that love story starring Leonardo DiCaprio and Kate Winslet did for our knowledge of the Titanic, this book will do for the eruption that buried Pompeii. It is primarily a human story that lends immediacy to the known historical events. I bought the book in anticipation of an upcoming visit to the ruins of Pompeii. Being armed with a wealth of information about life in the city and its environs from the book, I now expect to better enjoy the trip. This is so much better than reading a dry guidebook (of which I have several; a good one is 'Pompeii' by Pier Giovanni Guzzo available at Amazon.com) that I strongly recommend this book to anyone planning to visit the Naples area.
B00005LQ04|1.0|I love all the lofty, psuedo-intellectual babble praising this movie's cinematic \\"genius\\".  You know, you don't have to be in love with CRAP to be intellectual.  That's what these people don't understand.  Let's call a spade a spade here, folks.  This is an absolutely abysmal movie.  \\"Creepy music\\"?  Comical, yes. Creepy does not come to mind.  My roommate and I laughed incessantly everytime that silly theme started up.  (Oh, I suppose that is a sign of Argento's brilliance, that we can laugh at our own fear or some psycho-garbage like that)  God Almighty, the barbed wire looks like a freaking giant Slinky!  The sets are ridiculous.  (We couldn't stop laughing at the interesting decor)  The cultists will say you \\"don't get it\\" if you don't like it.  The truth is, it's just a terrible movie.  And the problem is that it's not even funny enough just to enjoy laughing at, other than the few moments I mentioned.  It's just dull, not the least bit frightening, and based on an utterly absurd premise... <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />p.s.  This is ZERO stars but I was not able to submit a review unless I chose from 1-5...
B0006L16N8|5.0|This is the first Coldplay album I've purchased. I first heard them on Saturday Night Live this past year.  i instantly fell in love with 'Speed of Sound.'  I am making a point of getting everything they put out.  I would definitely recommend this CD to anyone looking for a refreshing change of pace.
0440242576|5.0|In a chapter called \\"on certain modern writers and the institution of the family,\\" G. K. Chesterton wrote: \\"The thing which keeps life romantic and full of fiery possibilities is the existence of these great plain limitations which force all of us to meet the things we do not like or do not expect.  To be in a romance is to be in uncongenial circumstances.  To be born into this earth is to be born into uncongenial circumstances, hence to be born into a romance.\\"<br /><br />Skipping Christmas is a romance, hence about uncongenial circumstances.  Of course Grisham lays it on thick (This is a satire, critics.  In satires, one exagerates.  Got that?), both about the dark side of Christmas, and about the Kranks' neighbors. (Whose ideosyncracies, along with the schmaltzy and exploitative elements of Christmas that Grisham so over-does, define the limitations that entrap the Kranks, and create romance.)<br /><br />Personally, I love Christmas, and have never had intrusive neighbors.  But I recognized just enough truth to enjoy the exagerations, and the dry, slightly dark humor, and \\"ho-ho-hoed\\" my way to the end.  (Listening to the tape, read with just the right, slightly bitter, edge.)  And being a romantic at heart, I was also pleased with the highly romantic, though this-worldly (this is not a fairy tale, as another critic seems to expect) ending, an apocalypse of goofy good will to all.<br /><br />Maybe this book is not for all Grisham fans, or all fans of Christmas; perhaps it takes a certain humor.  But I also appreciate the way Grisham explores the romance of limits, even the romance of a \\"hum drum\\" middle class neighborhood. To quote Chesterton again: \\"We make our friends; we make our enemies; but God makes our next-door neighbor.  Hence he comes to us clad in al the careless terrors of nature; he is as strange as the stars, as reckless and indifferent as the rain.  He is Man, the most terrible of beasts.\\"<br /><br />author, Jesus and the Religions of Manof Man
B0009K7QZ8|5.0|season 3 starts in a couple weeks - sept 8th i think - so watch this fast.  you wont believe how it ends and you'll need to see it before season 3 which sounds like the best season yet.  also the music totally is amazing.  even if you were disappointed by season 2, it's still better than 99 percent of everything on tv.  i personally thought it was great.  the last half of the year especially were hard core.  trey is the best chracter yet. <br /> <br />with all teen movies (mostly) sucking, this show is like all your favorite 80s teen movies - every week!  buy it.  and its got way better features then season 1 dvd.
0679416781|4.0|The English Patient is a beautiful novel. One of the reason is  much more detail. The passages of dialogue between the english patient and the other characters are excellent. And his recollections of the desert. While I read this novel I can feel the taste, smell, touch and sound and I can imagine the characters and situations. <br /> <br />When World War 2, a women who name is Hana, the nurse is very tired by the death of her important people. She decided to take care the last of the English patient who forget his name and his past. Caravaggio is a thief. He tries to set the patient to recall his past, what he did, and what happened because of him. Caravaggio has lost both of thumbs. Kip who dismantles bombs, fall in love with Hana. But the accident which Hardy died divided them.Almacy recalls his past, his passionate love for Katharine who is married became a big tragedy for them. Also it made some big tragedies around them. <br /> <br />This novel is difficult to read because of the two stories, Almasy and Katharine, Hana and Kip. For me, as Japanese, more difficult. I can not understand the meaning, just one phrase. <br />There are many meanings include. I need knowledges about them to read. For example dominanse of England and geographic knowledge. <br /> <br />I am impressed descriptions of this novel. Michael Ondaatje described the view of the desert as a women's body. According to Almasy, a hollow of women's thorat is Bosporus. I am fascinated by his beautiful work. <br /> <br />He wrote this novel very poetic. So sometime it is hard to recognize the pronoun. \\" who is he?\\" or \\" who is she?\\"  <br /> <br />I also want to write about wonderful character,Count Almacy. He is a most enchanted character I have ever read. Before he got burned he didn't like to talk. But after that, he used to talk. As if he is a different person. He has a lot of attractions. He is  knowledgeable. He can speak many language. He likes to sing a song. Even he is a gerous man. His character still continue to exert a powerful hold on me.  <br /> <br />\\"The English Patient\\" is the most hauntingly beautiful book in my mind. <br />
B000002L9W|5.0|Great solo album why don't Warners re-release this as a remastered disc with the Spanish version of the album included as an extra disc.
B000002JPA|5.0|I just read some very disturbing comments on this band. I decided to look at reviews that people wrote bad (under like 3 stars) about this album. I found that mostly everyone absolutly hated the vocals, and thought that the members of DT were all too concerned about how good they are, and just put on a show that annoys people to no end.  <br />Well, personally i have to say that every musician in this band are amazing at their instruments. there is no denying that they are probably the most advanced musicians of our time. people who have anything bad to say about them are just jealous about the pure skill behind DT. If you are a guitarist and listen to petrucci, you will cry yourself to sleep every night. Singers will want to rip their vocal chords out after hearing the different notes that labrie can pull off, myung just rocks, plain and simple...keyboards...damn. half the time you cant even tell who is soloing, guitar or keys, and finally drums. god damn. even though portnoy has been on the front cover of all different kinds of musicians magazines, i still dont think that he gets enough credit for how intense he makes every part of every song they have put together.  <br />in any case, I&M is one of their all time best albums..along with scenes from a memory. i have to admit that it is more focused towards people who can actually appreciate music for what it really is. rather than the crap people listen to today. growling \\"metal\\" music, hardcore 1 chord songs, rap?? and freakin brittany spears kinds of music. oh sure, i will give it all a listen, but when you need a drum machine and you have to pay a million dollars that you daddy gives you just to pay off someone to put 3 chords together just to make a pop song that will come and go and you just sing over top of it, you dont belong in the music biz...cause you suck. lets face it. only real musicians like these guys should be on the top.  <br />well thats all i have to say.  <br /> <br />buy this album <br /> <br/>dream theater kicks ass <br /> <br />bye
B000022TSF|1.0|I don't get why Chinatown is such a well respected movie.  It is slooooow. Jack Nicholson plays Jack Nicholson.  Every scene is long and drawn out often with no dialogue to keep it interesting. Half an hour could have been shaved off this with no real loss. I mean do we really have to watch him climbing over a chainlink fence for 5 minutes.  No!  But the biggest beef I have is with the direction.  The filming of the ending scene which everyone always says is so great is all jumbly and amateur looking.<br /><br />I never really got to form an attachment to any of the main characters, they seemed more like modern actors self-consciously trying to embody certain film noir types.<br /><br />If you really want film noir go to the true source-- forties and fifties films like Panic in the Streets, the Asphalt Jungle, An Ace in the Hole or Laura.<br /><br />The only true heir to the film noir mantle in modern cinema is \\"The Usual Suspects.\\"  (Damn I wish Bryan Singer would make another movie like that one, but I digress)
B0009YA37W|4.0|3-4 years ago, any of the bands like Editors, Departure, Interpol, Bravery, and a number of others in that line of music, would be simply ignored on the premise \\"who'd want to listen to 80s goth pop revived\\"? Interestingly, many of these bands DID exist 3-4 years ago, albeit with no contract and not much looking uppy in their future. <br /> <br />Suddenly they're all handed contracts and are all revered as the saviours of rock. Must be pure coincidence huh? After all, the music industry's history is full of such amazing coincidences. <br /> <br />But to the band itself, the Editors, in my opinion, have the misfortune to have appeared after Interpol and those that followed them. And i say \\"misfortune\\" but it is quite plausible that the Editors are actually better than the rest of the lot. <br /> <br />Some might rightfully ask \\"why\\", and the answer might lay in the fact that the Editors weren't spooked to go darker than their \\"competitors\\", not to mention, that they've got everything the rest of their genre has, possibly even in better quality. <br /> <br />If you've heard all the aforementioned bands there would be no need here to describe the Editors' music as it follows exactly in that line. <br /> <br />But if i were to recommend you one of all these groups i wouldn't hesitate much to name the Editors.  <br /> <br />As it usually goes in cases like that, some will be unjustfully propelled to the top, and some unjustfully ignored to oblivion. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
1577314808|5.0|This book was recommended to me by my therapist, who is also a spiritual teacher much in the manner of Tolle. I was coping with chronic, lifelong depression and was on an antidepressant when I began working with her. Her approach of mindfulness and awareness was completely different from anything I had ever experienced. I eventually stopped the medication and later felt moved [totally of my own accord] to meditate for a few minutes each morning. I noticed immediately that my days were easier, more peaceful when I meditated, and less so when I didn't. This was a miracle to  me that -- as someone who had often struggled just to make it through each day -- such a simple thing could make my life completely different. As such, I was eager to do more and asked my teacher for some readings. She immediately recommended \\"The Power of Now.\\" <br /> <br />When I picked up this book I had been actively pursuing awareness/consciousness with her guidance for several months. My independent meditation practice was a few months old. My practice was [and is]: ten minutes each morning, and a periodic returning to the present throughout the day.  <br /> <br />I have been fortunate to have had some glorious moments over the past few months where I have been in meditation or in therapy and have felt a connection to something indescribable, an energy of some kind, something beyond that which we can see. I credit my therapist/teacher for helping me do this, and I highly recommend this type of assistance for those who are keen on furthering their awareness. Tolle also makes this same recommendation in the book, using the analogy of a log burning brightly making it easier for a nearby log to burn more brightly. I have found this to be very true in my work with my therapist/teacher. <br /> <br />As Tolle says in the introduction, those who haven't yet experienced connectedness [through meditation or life experience] may find the book interesting, but highly repetitive. He also says that thosewho have experienced connectedness will instead see a myriad of stepping-off points to go deeper into awareness. This was definitely my experience, as I found myself time and again feeling the connectedness he was describing. At points I found it so moving it made me cry -- not in sadness, but with joy at the beauty of the world. Reading this book was a powerful experience. <br /> <br />The moments of connectedness I've had have been brief, but life changing. Tolle brings that experience alive again in his writing. However, if you are not actively pursuing awareness on a regular basis, you might find reading this book merely intriguing, but no more. And it may then seem like many other books out there that promise more than they deliver. <br /> <br />I have been actively meditating for about three months. A year ago I would have laughed at you if you told me I was soon going to have a daily meditation practice. However, I am living proof that if you put in the effort, you will be amazed at what you receive from the experience. And I found this book an invaluable guide to that process.
B00005JNNZ|4.0|This was a good movie. Truly inspirational. A dedicated coach tries to lead his team to victory on the court AND in the classroom.  <br /> <br />As oppose to most sports movies--Coach Carter isn't all about victory. It's about something much deeper. The movie does, however, have its imperfections. I agree with a previous reviewer. The subplot with a player and his pregnant girlfriend took away from the story a little. And although most of the games were exciting to watch--they got to be repetitive after a while. I found myself drifting off a little during the championship game at the end. And the whole 'life is tough in the hood' scenario gets old after a while. They played that out as well. But other than that, I thought the movie was great. Good to see some fresh new faces on screen.
B0009HLDFU|1.0|Sorry Foo Fighters. This CD will never be in my collection. I will stop buying CDs altogether if this draconian measure becomes an industry wide standard. Long live vinyl.
0783225733|5.0|Love this movie, would recommend it to anyone who would like to be grossly entertained for 220 minutes.  Both acting and direction are great.  My favorite Ron Howard movie.  Gary Sinise and Ed Harris shine.
1401206905|5.0|I thought this one was excellant. Especially since they included Gordon's point of view.  I could've done without the presence of Catwoman but it didn't detract from the story. The pages were done well and Gotham looked just like it should.  I can't believe how much Wayne looked like Gregory Peck!
B00002MZ2C|5.0|Well first off idiot, they are not claiming to be from Los Angeles, the title is referring to how Los Angeles keeps going downhill and the battle never ends. They have been \\"raging against the machine\\" that pays them, do you really think they care? Unlike yourself, they are not ignorant whiny pieces of dookie. Funny how you make the assumption that they are rich boys from Irvine, yes but do you believe that rich boys would actually be in a great political band such as RATM? If so then you are stupider than I thought, don't comment anymore till you grow a brain...
B00006JJ1O|5.0|As said in other countless reviews, many believe that the only reason people buy this album is because of the controversy that t.A.T.u has created. They may have confessed their lesbian image but the chemistry is still there. The album is indeed all about them, love or no love. You don't have to be sexually in love when you say you love someone. It's all about chemistry and Lena and Yulia certainly have it.  <br />And after almost 3 years of silence, no my dear readers they have not disappeared into the icky world of one hit wonders, Lena and Yulia are back with their long awaited sophomore Dangerous and Moving in which the new single All About Us will hit the airwavews this month or on the 1st of September. This time it's just them and the music, with no chauvinisitic producer/manager Ivan Shapovalov to drag around.

B0009K7QZ8|5.0|i luv the OC!  and i know this year it got popular, and mischa was on every cover of every magazine ever and so a backlash was going to happen.  and the beginning of the season was i guess a little slow (except i loved the first episode, and chrismukkah, and when seth gets drunk, and the snowC ball so it couldnt have been so slow) but after that its awesome.   <br />a lot of people hated on the show too 'cuz they wanted all their faves together (R/M forever) but they didnt get their way so they complained.  im glad theyre all together now (arent they real people?  aw, man they're just on tv) and i cant wait for the new season (when does it start?)  the more you watch the show, the more you like the eppies, at least i do.  i think a lot of people will rewatch the season and say oops, this is great and so much better then OTH or LagunaB or any other teen show.  if you like this buy Freaks and Geeks, and Undeclared too.  the best cast on tv since those shows.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I especially enjoy cranking this album up loud (to eleven) when I search for car batteries to lick. I also play it whenever I engage in a bit of \\"meat puppetry\\", the hard edged sound offsets the cutesy looks of my puppets.
B0009K7QZ8|4.0|The second season of the O.C. attempts to build on the first while forcing its viewers not to take every character at face value.  Ryan becomes a \\"good boy\\" while Marissa has a fling with a girl, Sandy and Kirsten become the antithesis of the perfect couple, and Julie shows she has more depth than her perfectly crafted facade admits.  Sometimes these changes work.  It's facinating to watch Marissa navigate through her bourgeoning sexuality and rebellion, and Sandy and Kirsten's marriage problems make the adults much more interesting than they ever have been.  However, Ryan's new good boy routine makes him lose most of his appeal, and many of the plot lines were either dropped between seasons or changed in a way that makes them completely unbelievable.  It's still fun, and I'm still buying it, but if you're debating between the first two seasons, I would definitely go for season 1.
B0009XNUK0|5.0|Why there had to be another Michael Jackson Best of-album with a similar tracklist as \\"History\\", \\"Greatest Hits\\", \\"Number Ones\\" and \\"The Ultimate Collection\\" remains an open question. But in contrast to the Box Set this album is a lot less expensive. So if you like \\"The Jackson 5\\", \\"The Jacksons\\" and Michael as a solo artist this is the ideal collection of songs. <br />The first CD starts off peppy with \\"I want you back\\", \\"ABC\\" and \\"The love you save\\" which are without a doubt the three best songs of the \\"Jackson 5\\" and will surely put you in a good mood. <br />\\"Got to be there\\" and \\"Ben\\" are two timeless ballads which show young Michael's enormous volume. After that the album is taken to another level by a row of sensational dancefloor tracks like \\"Shake Your Body\\" and Michael's first ultimate worldwide hit \\"Don't stop 'til you get enough\\", which will truly get every party going. Nevertheless the album even manages to beat this with the never-to-be-beaten baseline of \\"Billie Jean\\" and the immensely powerful \\"Beat It\\". <br />The second CD presents eight hits from \\"Bad\\" including the fantastic No. 1 \\"Man in the Mirror\\" which could not be found on \\"Number Ones\\" and the catchy \\"Smooth Criminal\\". <br />This is followed by Michael's biggest hit of the 90s \\"Black or White\\" and further great songs from the \\"Dangerous\\"-album. Among them classics like the tremendously groovy \\"Who is it\\" and the bombast-ballade \\"Will you be there\\". <br />To sum it up, on this album every great song is followed by another smash and it thereby shows an immense variety of music. The two CDs undenieably demonstrate that most of Jackson's songs are surely timeless. Therefore \\"The Essential Michael Jackson\\" is the ultimate album for everyone who likes good music. There is no better.
B0009HLDFU|5.0|So it appears that this is more than likely the last Foo disk for a long time, if ever.  If it is the final chapter of the Foo's now 11 year run as a band (ridiculous to think that Dave Grohl has been a singer on more major label records than he has been a drummer), then it is a fitting exit.  <br /> <br />Highlights: <br />1) Disc 1: Best of You, DOA, and In Your Honor.  In a recent interview, Dave said that half this record was written in his head while on John Kerry's tour bus.  He gets two gold stars from me for this.  One for writing a hell of a rock record, the other for being a Democrat.  Ok, basically the music is on point here.  The first 3 songs fill the air with the harder edge of the Foo's sound, and the album mellows only slightly towards the end, as the more top 40 sound comes out after 'Hell'.  Great musicianship by new guitarist Chris Shifflet, while Nate Mendel (who's work with SDRE is classic) and a now sober Taylor Hawkins hold up the low end sound with their incredible sense of timing and structure.  Never overpowering with solos and extras, this disc thankfully features no rapping or other 'wtf's?'.  Lyrically, Dave is writing well and being purposely abstract/transparent with his singing. <br /> <br />2) Disc 2: Friend of a Friend, Razor. Intended to be a solo record or soundtrack, this disc is possibly the most personal Grohl we'll ever see.  He finally admits to writing about Kurt (Friend of a Friend) and even has JPJ of Led Zepplin and Norah Jones guest on one track apiece.  His lyrics are remniscent of 'walking after you' from TCATS, stalker-esque with a hint of genuine passion.  Great stuff.  To me, the duet with Norah Jones is a nice little foray into jazz-blues for the two, who handle the song quite nicely.  Personally, it doesn't get better than the final song, 'razor'.  Just turn the lights off and put this disk on and wander off in thought for a while.   <br /> <br />Lowlights: <br />Copy protection sucks, so do autodrivers.  But hell, I don't really care.   <br /> <br />I personally DON'T reccomend this album for fans of TNLTL or even OBO.  This is a disc for fans of TCTS and for fans who actually appreciate artistic growth and expression.
080012166X|4.0|\\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" or, more properly, \\"Francis Ford Coppola's Dracula\\"? The assumption was that the title was chosen to stake a claim to being the film adaptation closest to Bram Stoker's original gothic novel, but the reason was more mundane. Another studio had the rights to the title \\"Dracula,\\" so a qualification was necessary. Since this 1992 horror film would have the same characters along with the same general plotline as the novel, this seemed reasonable enough. But screenwriter James V. Hart added a significant element to Stoker's novel that justified the movie's potent tagline, \\"Love Never Dies.\\" As director, Francis Ford Coppola provides the stylistic flourishes, which are this movie's best parts, but Hart is the one who is responsible for the derivations.<br /><br />In the novel Count Dracula only makes vague reference to the historical Vlad the Impaler, son of the prince known as Dracul (the Dragon), hence the name Dracula (son of the Dragon), when he tells his guest Jonathan Harker of the history of his family. Hart takes advantage of what we know about the historical figure to craft the film's prologue. Vlad (Gary Oldman) is fighting the Turkish invaders, not simply as a prince of Wallachia, but rather as more of a true Christian knight. He succeeds, but the exaggerated rumor of his death reaches his beloved Elisabeta (Winona Ryder), who throws herself to her death from the castle walls. As a suicide she cannot be buried on consecrated ground, and an outraged Vlad renounces God and is somehow transmorgraphies into a vampire as a result of his blasphemy. Then we get to the beginning of the novel.<br /><br />Harker (Keanu Reeves) is traveling to Transylvania to Dracula's castle to complete a series of real estate transactions that will allow the Count to come to London and live in style. Something not very nice happened to the previous member of Harker's firm to make this trip (can you say Renfield?), but the old Count only seems eccentric. However, when he sees a picture of Harker's fianc&eacute;e, Mina Harker (Ryder), the Count knows that she is the reincarnation of his beloved Elisabeta. Now Dracula has reason to not only travel to London, but to make himself young again so that he can woo his woman.<br /><br />Once we move from Transylvania to London, we meet the rest of our cast of characters. Mina's best friend, Lucy Westenra (Sadie Frost), is being courted by Dr. Jack Seward (Richard E. Grant), who runs his own little asylum, Lord Arthur Holmwood (Cary Elwes), a handsome nobleman, and Quincey P. Morris (Bill Campbell), who hails from the American West. However, before Lucy can choose from amongst her beaus, she becomes the new bride of Dracula instead. Fortunately, Professor Abraham Van Helsing (Anthony Hopkins) knows more about medicine than what is found in science books and knows what is to be done in this situation. Meanwhile, Count Dracula manages to run into Miss Mina, and the seduction is on.<br /><br />The production design on this film is fantastic. When it first came out on DVD I would use it as a prime example of what could be down with sets and decor: Thomas E. Sanders and Garrett Lewis were nominated for an Oscar. The film won Oscars for Eiko Ishioka's Costume Design, and the Makeup of Greg Cannom, Mich&egrave;le Burke and Matthew W. Mungle, as well as the Sound Effects Editing by Tom C. McCarthy and David E. Stone. Cinematographer Michael Ballhaus deserves to be mentioned despite similar notice. The bottom line is that this is a great looking film, which is one of the things we come to expect in Coppola's work.<br /><br />Oldman's performance as Dracula is interesting. Given all the actors who have come before from Max Schreck and Bela Lugosi to Christopher Lee and Frank Langella, it is hard to stake out new ground in the role. But Oldman bases his characterization on not only the romantic but also the tragic elements of this particular Dracula. Unfortunately, the performances of the cast are the weakest part of the film. Reeves is far and away the most wooden, but Ryder does not create a woman worth waiting for as far as I am concerned, which is the true weakest point of the film. Hopkins follows Laurence Olivier in the Van Helsing role and in a similar vein creates an eccentric ethnic know-it-all who spends a lot of time basically telling the gang of fearful vampire slayers to shut up and do what he says.<br /><br />When \\"Bram Stoker's Dracula\\" is over you will be struck by how gorgeous the film is from start to finish. That will make up for so many of the actors being as wooden as the stakes used to dispatch the vampires. Hart's twist on the tale helps improve Stoker's original ending, which was basically a race to kill Dracula before the sun sets. The tragic element established by the prologue is adequately played out in the ending. This film might be another example of the triumph of style over substance, but given the depths that some vampire movies can reach, it is nice to have one that aspires to such artistic pretensions.are the weakest part of the film.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Absolutely one of the best programs I've ever seen. Can't believe this series was cancelled, it is a great loss, especially to lovers of sci-fi. From concept to characterization to special effects to dialog, etc., etc., it is a gem and I highly recommend it. The special features were very good, too, however, being the film junkie that I am, I would have liked more. <br />My only problem w/ the DVD has been the lag time when navigating the different screens. Might be a problem w/ my player. Certainly not something that should prevent anyone from buying the boxed set.

B00000612P|5.0|Drastically different from his later efforts, \\"Every Picture Tells a Story\\" is essentially Rod Stewart's masterpiece. Toting the monstorous hit \\"Maggie May,\\" Rod Stewart's career shot into overdrive after this album was released and eventually sent him spiraling into superstardom; it was this stardom that changed his music (for the worst) forever. Here, however, he's at the top of his game. <br /> <br />It opens up with the folk-rock of the title track. Stewart proves right off the bat that he can rock without any electricity, as he and his band (and they are a BIG part of it) belt out this rocker with only acoustic instruments. <br />This formula was present in his first two brilliant albums, and it's even more refined here. <br /> <br />The rest of the album follows suit as Stewart delivers the srtaight-forward folk of Dylan's \\"Tomorrow is a Long Time,\\" the hard rocking \\"That's All Right\\" and \\"I Know (I'm Losing You),\\" and of course two of his own folk-rock masterpieces: \\"Maggie May\\" and \\"Mandolin Wind,\\" the latter two being some of the best blends of folk and rock in the 70's and to this day for that matter. Stewart's use of mandolin in his music is an authentically masterful touch, and his frequent use of the violin adds a delicate touch to his soft compositions. <br /> <br />To say the least, it's the best folk-rock album of the 70's and ranks as one of the best ever. It really is hard to believe that the writer of \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy\\" could possibly write something as delicately beautiful as \\"Mandolin Wind,\\" but I'm not complaining. Rod Stewart managed to be brilliant back in the day, even if he preferred to sing about \\"Hot Legs\\" later in his career.  <br />
B00028HBKM|5.0|Seeing as this is required when reviewing this movie I'll get this out of the way. I have no religious beliefs. Now that that is out of the way on to my review. <br /> <br />When I first saw \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" I didn't like it. I felt it was too long and boring. The violence didn't bother me so much I just wanted it to end. I decided to give it another shot and this time I liked it a little bit better. So when it came out on DVD I decided to pick it up.  <br /> <br />It is widely reported that Mel Gibson's original intent was show this movie without subtitles letting the image speak for itself. So I decided to watch it without subtitles. It is painfully obvious that this is how the film should be seen. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is not about the life of Jesus or the teachings of Jesus. It is about his death. In this case Passion meaning suffering. So when you take away the distraction of reading words on screen you focus on what you are seeing and the image becomes that much more powerful. <br /> <br />As said before this movie is only about The Passion. It is not about Jesus' life or teachings. Those looking for that story will find it in other films. The best probably being Martin Scorsese's \\"The Last Temptation of Christ\\" It does help to have a little background on the story. <br /> <br />With the aid (or distraction) of subtitles \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is long, boring and preachy.\\" Without them it is a visual experience like no other and the best movie about Jesus Christ ever. <br /> <br />The DVD comes in a bare bones release with no extra features. What it lacks in special features it more then makes up for them in the audio and visual department. This is reference quality material and a must buy for home theatre buffs.

If it hadn't been for Axl Rose's huge ego, they would still be pumping out their amazing music. Every song on this album is a work of art. They all show how bad rock music has become in the last 5 or so years. Before buying this CD, I was a big NSYNC fan. That's right. I listened to boy bands. I had been told by my friends that this was the kind of CD that everyone should own so I reluctantly bought it. After hearing Welcome To The Jungle, I was hooked. When the CD finally ended, I almost cried over all the years that I had spent without Guns n' Roses. If this CD was being sold for $100 dollars, it would still be worth the money, and if you all don't buy it, you will never be complete.
B00005JMEW|4.0|\\"Kill Bill\\" will have you pining for the days after school when \\"Kung Fu Theatre\\" came on. That's not all, though-Uma Thurman pretty much singlehandledly kills upwards of 150 people with a katana. Certain people right now are clicking the \\"Add To Cart\\" button just for that alone. This is savagery and camp gore elevated to high art. Those of you who didn't tolerate this deathfest too well, I have no idea why you wanted to watch a Tarantino film in the first place... <br /> <br />Anyway, to return my attention to the um, target audience(the people who can handle a little creative video violence...but man, there is ALOT in this particular film) it's a ballet of death that will easily meet or transcend your expectations if you know what you're looking for from this movie. But really...if you don't like violence in movies for its own sake, don't go near this thing. You will be insulted, revulsed, and wonder what the world is coming to when people are getting off on 2 hours of nonstop decapitations, stabbings and lopping of limbs. I'm afraid some of us have been dreaming of it.
0224071262|5.0|Let me tell to you begin with that I have looked forward to this book ever since I heard that Jung Chang was working on it, and that feels like already ages ago by now. After reading the book I was left in a sort of confusion, although completely baffled by all the horrifying facts that are passing bye along the almost 900 pages.<br /><br />Here other reviewers have already spoiled their critics and perhaps some of them are not so wrong. While others hailed it and praised it as a completely new and fresh look on Mao's reign. I balance more to the later one, although I sense a taste of the first one too. Especially cos of one sentence at the end of the book. And that is that they do not reveal the sources they have used in China. As any historian knows, by doing this you make it completely unusable for academic use. Although if you read the book, it gives me the idea that its extremely we'll documented and we'll tugged away for years. They constantly refer to how secret sertain sources were, how we'll kept in hiding and so on. So in a way, understandable that they were not abble to reveal thier sources completely.<br /><br />However the real strength of the book lies not in the use of documents, I think with a little bit of pushing, we all would have been abble to get through. Chang (and most probably her husband too) is fluent in Mandarin and as I know from all my trips to China, this certainly is a great benefit if you really want to go offbeaten. And offbeaten they wen't. If you read the book, page after page you read 'on the age of...........she/he told us, the daughter of............told us' and so on. What they went to do, what others did not is to find the people that were still alive and get the stories as directly as possible. I can imagine that tracking down and searching for all these persons must have taken most of the 10 years. What comes out of this, indeed are the real shocking fact. The stories of torture, death & mutalation are mainly based on first hand interview, and they make you want to throw up, when it comes to detail. So be warned.<br /><br />All in all comes together in an almost complete unmysting of the facts as we all knew them till now. What you read in the Cambridge, Spence, Fairbanks and so on, is so different from what you will read in this book. Some things and facts are almost completely turned around, or turned into shreds. Nothing is left from the myths around the Great March, the founding of the CCP, where Mao was not a part of, the march together with the Nationalists on the Japanese, the good things he did for China, as we always thought he did. So that in the end all that is left is a story of death and misery. If it really has been like this, who shall say. But dont forget that we were not there either. We only know what know from the things we hear and read. Chang talked to persons that were actually there and Im pretty sure that they know alot beter than we, what went going on there.<br /><br />Im not saying its 100 accurate, but then no historical writing ever is. Simply cos history is not what we write, but the things that are deliverd to us, that we need in order too write. And maybe she did change the facts in order to prove her right. But then is that not what every historian is doing ? Is that not what is called rhetorics ?<br /><br />I think she did right in doing what she did, for years people have been writing about the good sides of mao, now its about time that we learn something of his evil side.

0385510454|4.0|Sometimes we want steak, sometimes hotdogs, sometimes Shakespeare. sometimes a ball game. This novel is entertainment, nothing more. Under any in depth analysis the plot simply does not hold up. Motivations are downright missing. So why such big sales, Even a well known writer can't get away with a real stinker. Well this is not a stinker. It is like the gifted magician. We all know you cannot climb up the rope and disappear, and we all know we have been fooled when it seems the fellow in the top-hat and cape does so, but darn it, we like it. It's fun. Thank heaven our politicians are not this venal, our government agencies this inept or lawyers so traitoriously greedy, but let's just suppose they were. <br /> <br />This is an entertainment novel, set in an exotic place - face it how many think of Bologna when Italy is mentioned; would not Pittsburgh or Cleveland be exotic for Italians who think of the U.S. as New York. Grisham has fun with the city, gives us a classic chase as climax,and provides a happy ending. Come to think of it, asking reality of this is like asking for it in \\"The Bank Dick.\\"  Mr. Fields may have missed Bologna, but it was a kick seeing it with Marco. I give it four beach umbrellas as a \\"not think too hard\\" summer read.
B000001OAA|5.0|This is quite the efficent pop record. Taking it's cues largely from Curve, Garbage blended alternative rock elements with electronic flavours to create their first record. It's a simeple enough template: angsty guitars with a couple loops thrown in; it runs the gammut of popular alternative genres of the 80's & 90's, from grunge to new wave to trip hop. The lyricism tends to be on the naive/disposable side, though, with \\"I'm Only Happy When It Rains\\" being the most sappy, lending itself to that post-Cobain, \\"poor me\\" school of thought. It's the kind of track that conveniently gives it's listener a reason to dress in black and feign gloom for a few minutes. When you listen to it you can tell it was one of the first records to be aimed directly at disaffected teens who were weened on pop as kids and wanted an introspective slice of Nirvana-esque self-loathing sans all the emotional depth. \\"Garbage\\" paved the way for more alternative acts to look and sound edgy without being inaccessible or threatening(Evanescence, anyone?), and in that it does exactly what it's supposed to.
B0009SQMIW|4.0|Kansas were one of the few American bands to whole heartedly jump on the progressive rock bandwagon.This album, originally released in 1984, brings together most of their most popular singles and key album tracks and despite the inclusion of a couple of truly wretched 80's songs is perhaps their most enjoyable.                                                 Carry On Wayward Son is their one truly transcendental song with its rousing chorus, shifting rhythms and great guitar/keyboard interplay.Other highlights are the wonderful and evocative Point of Know Return, the sublime Dust in the Wind which has become something of a standard, and to top it all, the superb Song For America which is their most exciting and fully realized progressive rock epic. <br />The album is somewhat marred by the predictable inclusion of a few more recent songs (Kansas were still an ongoing concern in the 80's). Especially jarring is the bland corporate rocker Fight Fire With Fire which is a depressing reminder of just how uninspired 80's rock was. While listening to 70's Kansas evokes images of trailblazing pioneers seeking new frontiers, whenever I hear that song all that is conjured up is an image of a spandex clad singer with blow-dried hair prancing around the stage like a prat. <br />Fortunately though, this is an excellent overview and is highly recommended. <br />
0783227434|5.0|All I have to say is Wow. <br /> <br />I actually first saw this movie with my friends when I was really intoxicated and I found it to be the greatest movie I've ever seen. The next day I hobbled to the nearest store and bought it and I haven't regretted it since. <br /> <br />I continue to pop this into the DVD player ever since I bought it and I'll never get tired of hearing boomstick, Bruce Campbell's catch lines, and watching some witch thing bounce off some trampoline at S-mart. <br /> <br />5 stars no doubt about it.
B0002858YS|5.0|<br /> <br />Brandon Flowers is a great singer.  His vocal presence is very circus showmanlike.  The unique feature of his singing is his syncopation.  Very suave.
6305127646|4.0|For the most part, the action scenes are great.  The chemistry between Kilmer and Shue works well.  My friends and I always get a laugh when quoting this movie.  The only thing I cannot stand about it is the Russian characters always speaking in English with eachother rather than in Russian.  I know this is obviously so the audience does not have to read subtitles, but it would have made the movie a bit more authentic.  They could have done something like was done in \\"Hunt for Red October\\".  The actors spoke Russian, and then a close up was done to an actor's mouth and he started to speak English.  This has always been a beef I have had with movies with characters that are foreign.  Overall, it is a good movie and the soundtrack is good too.
B0000255CL|5.0|I truly love Immortal.  They are so original and unique in their style and skills.  I was sold on Sons Of Northern Darkness.  Just totally engrossed and obsessed.  However, the more I listen to At The Heart Of Winter, the more it grows on me...Like permafrost!  It is a masterpiece and a great composition by Abbath and company.  Horgh was a great addition to the lineup and what a ferocious drummer he is!  Withstand the Fall Of Time and Where Dark And Light Don't Differ are my personal favorites.  Awesome awesome awesome!  Get all their works...they truly were masters of their art.
B000089RVR|4.0|That's what I am thinking with this great second album of hers. I would say, although a bunch will hate me for it, but it's the truth to me, is that this c.d. is even better than her first No Angel. It is more free, more light, and yes, more fun. The songs are great to hear when you are just relaxing from a long day or just want to turn down the volume and hear more softer, plesant music for awhile. I have both loud and soft music and on one day I want to hear loud and then the other times I just want to hear soft and lovely, and that is what Dido is, soft and lovely. This c.d. does sound a lot more light- hearted than No Angel and I like this side of Dido a lot.  <br />I also love the music in the background a lot of the times it matches perfectly with Dido. A lot of the times singers will pick bad background music for a perfectly good voice, but Dido knows what she's doing definitely. I also love her voice a whole lot, I always have. It is different and sticks out from the crowd and that is what I look for these days, difference from the crowd and Dido is a good singer to have with us and I hope she sticks around for a long while cause we need singers like her with her way of music. <br />Why this c.d. is not five stars? There are one or two songs on here that I do skip because they do not sound the best. There are songs on here you'll attach yourself to so quickly, and there are one or two you'll find yourself skipping. They're all right but not as powerful as others.  <br />The strongest songs on here: <br />White Flag was a good hit <br />Life For Rent- Nice  <br />Mary's In India- I always liked this song too, very nice sound. <br />Home- Amazing! I love this song a whole lot. <br />Sand In My Shoes- Uplifting, catchy, a good dance hit. <br />This Land Is Mine- I always liked this song. <br />See The Sun Pt 1- There are two parts to this song, but the first song is beautiful I love it. <br />Pt 2- I never got why she did this but if you ever noticed wait for the song See The Sun to end and then if you can fast forward it, you'll noticed the minutes speed by for maybe like two minutes without any sound, but then a guitar will strum after seven minutes and you'll hear a whole new song come on. Why she has two songs lumped together I have no idea. After See The Sun fast forward to at least 7: 05 and you'll hear the new song come on, and it is worth the wait regardless because it is a good song. Very sweet, with really only Dido and a guitar.  <br /> <br />The one song I find the weakest on here is Who Makes You Feel. I never liked that song. But the others are good to hear as well that I have not mentioned, but probably will take more time to get into than the others above. Home and Sand In My Shoes I just love though, and See The Sun's both parts are a close runner up.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|First off, I don't really care for copyright protection myself, but these reviews should really concentrate on the music of the album.  A comment about the protection is fine, but giving it one star because of that kind of takes away from the purpose of the review system. <br /> <br />Anyway, it took me a while to appreciate the album, but I really like it.  The Color and the Shape is probably still me favorite Foo Fighters album, but this has a lot of the same elements.  Not perfect, but a really good evolution from the band.  Their musical talent is evident from their ability to keep things interesting after 10 years. <br /> <br />On a side note, I just saw them live for the first time this past weekend and it was an outstanding show.  Their energy is unmatched and the set had awesome variety.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|To see low reviews for this album reinforce the fact that music fans of today are afraid to let themselves go to accept something completely different.  Most fans have categorized themselves to be \\"metal fans\\" or \\"indie fans\\" or \\"emo fans\\" and this album will not appeal to any of them.  When I first heard \\"De-Loused in the Comatorium\\" I didn't know what to feel. It was too strange and hard to digest.  After multiple listens and being attentive to the content and absorbing all of the different influences in their albums, I became hooked. <br /> <br />To rebut the person who calls the lyrics \\"laughable\\", this is obviously someone who has no insight and likes to listen to albums that probably cuss and scream all the time.  What this album is is an aural representation of surrealist art.  It's abstract, it's sensational, filled with strange characters with graphic descriptions.  But, like surrealist visual art, it all has meaning.  Go to their website or read the lyrics carefully and you will see this whole album is all about a character seeking out his mother and discovering all the darkness and evil that comes with this dicovery.  The character, Frances the Mute, then seems to become that same evil being.  At least that is my interpretation.  So the lyrics may be laughable to a Limp Bizkit fan, but anyone who has some kind of artistic appreciation would enjoy it.   <br /> <br />This album incorporates quite a few different styles.  There is obviously a classic rock influence but the make it unique by incorporating electronic samples and a lot of latin influence. My one criticism would be that there is too much transitionary noise, especially after the conclusion of \\"The Widow\\".  The transitionary stuff is definitely necessary for this album and there should be no sound breaks, but that particular break is too long and I have to hit skip to L'Via.  <br /> <br />If you have an open mind about rock music, you are really hurting yourself by not checking both of the Mars Volta's albums.  If you are just another mindless, unimaginative rock fan that commits \\"Genre-cide\\" then stay away from it and go buy the new My Chemical Romance CD.
B000002BFL|4.0|This is definately in the top three of Springsteen's best ever albums. \\"Across the Border\\" is one of his best songs and don't know why it isn't a single or put on one of his many greatest hits albums. I love the hybrid-country style which to the best of knowlege is a unique sound here. If there's another artist with likewise I would like know..The only thing I have to admit to is that I didn't like this CD on first listening and I stored it away for almost 10 years. There's also a couple of songs here that the album could probably have sounded better without, but then that's always the case with Springsteen.  <br /> <br />
B0002VEPRQ|5.0|\\"Mary Poppins\\" is one of those classic musicals that you probably loved as a kid, then think you outgrew- until you show it to your own kids (or yourself) and happily sing along. That's what I found on viewing this Disney masterpiece for the first time in decades. The fabulous Julie Andrews- already a Broadway/ West End star, and here an Oscar winner right out of the gate- became a beloved institution as the world's most famous nanny. Dick Van Dyke was already a huge TV star before he shined here as Bert the chimney sweep/sidewalk artist/one-man band, weird Noo Yawk-cockney accent and all. A host of Brits both veteran (foppish David Tomlinson and vibrant Glynis Johns) and young (the button-cute Karen Dotrice and the late Matthew Garber) fill out the excellent cast, probably the best in any live-action Disney movie before or since. Look for Van Dyke in his Rip Van Winkle getup, too, as what his old boss Carl Reiner might have called \\"the 2000-year-old bank president\\". <br />      The Sherman brothers would score many more Disney and related family movies, but never came close to the joy of this one. With its distinctive Olde English lilt (music-hall, military marches, Gilbert and Sullivan), the music did a huge part to make \\"Mary Poppins\\" the treasure it is: \\"Spoonful of Sugar\\", \\"Jolly Holiday\\", \\"Chim-Chim-Cheree\\" (an Oscar winner on its own), the still-haunting \\"Feed The Birds\\" and, of course, that busker-flavored number with the 34-letter title...oh, dear, what is it? \\"Super-Calabogus...Super-California...got it! Docious-Ali-Expi...\\" Never mind. If you don't know this song, don't bother reading any further and go back to your \\"adult\\" fare. <br />        I'd forgotten about the animated sequences and art work that combined with the superb settings and wardrobe (designed by Julie's then-husband) to give \\"Mary Poppins\\" its authentic atmosphere and feel for Edwardian London. Disney had a couple of house Brits- director Robert Stevenson (\\"Swiss Family Robinson\\",<br />\\"Treasure Island\\") and artist Peter Ellenshaw (his gorgeous title painting of Olde London Towne)- who really did transport you back in time along with the cast and songs. The animation isn't exactly Pixar-style, but the soft-color, old-school Disney <br />look is just right for the carnival/teatime/race course \\"Jolly Holiday\\" sequence, penguins and all. <br />       The bonus material, as you'd expect for a true classic, is superb. We learn from the documentary feature (almost an hour in itself) that Disney pursued the movie rights as early as 1938. You might say it was worth his wait! Just about all of the surviving principals are part of the extras and commentary, which include two delightful musical segments with songwriter Dick Sherman. One of these brings back Julie and Dick to reminisce and sing their songs- most warmly indeed. On his own, Sherman reveals the inspiration for the tunes (\\"Step In Time\\" was adapted from the music-hall dance tune \\"Knees Up Mother Brown\\"). There are moving moments, too: Sherman on how \\"Feed The Birds\\" moved Walt like no other song; a still-girlish Karen Dotrice, long-retired from acting, breaks down when she tells of co-star Matthew Garber's death at 21 and Walt's own passing two years after \\"Poppins\\"' release. Not many movies can stir such emotions, happy and sad, 40 years on- this one does. Finally, as with many Disney (and Pixar) DVDs, there's an animated bonus: \\"The Cat who Looked at the King\\", adapted from a later P.L. Travers story, a cute little cartoon fable featuring great voice work by Tracey Ullman (as a white kitten with a moral) and David Ogden Stiers (as know-it-all Old King Cole). <br />        Whether you have children or not, it should be a must to watch \\"Mary Poppins\\" at least once a year, as not only a great piece of true family entertainment but a reminder of how both Disney and Hollywood really did care about quality movies for ages 3 to 93. A wonderful package for a wonderful musical- the kind you know they don't make any more. Highly recommended! <br />
B0000C8AVE|5.0|While it's one of Dylan's most popular records, let's face facts: \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" would be baffling and inaccessible for any first-time listener. The album is entirely acoustic, with arrangements consisting merely of guitar and harmonica. Dylan's voice hadn't yet loosened up as it would over his next few albums: he sounds hoarse and often gruff, though it's totally charming. <br /> <br />The saving grace of the album (for anyone who doesn't consider Dylan's stylistic idiosyncrasies to be one of his greatest strengths) is its wit and strong songwriting. The first Dylan album where all the songs are his own (well, with the exception of \\"Corrina, Corrina\\"), this is a glorious set of tunes ranging from the playful \\"I Shall Be Free\\" to the dead-serious \\"Masters of War\\". <br /> <br />On some of the songs, Dylan giggles with the sheer absurdity of the things he's saying; on others, his voice achieves something like an oracular, Old Testament intonation that will send chills up anyone's spine. <br /> <br />Given the variety of his work, it's hard to name any Dylan album as his best - but what we get here is the earliest manifestation of his full personality and dynamism. Though not necessarily for a huge audience, \\"The Freewheelin' Bob Dylan\\" is a classic.
B00005JLEX|5.0|What can I say about Seinfeld, other than it's the greatest show of all time.  There isn't a single episode in which I don't enjoy.  If I could only watch one show for the rest of my life, it would have to be Seinfeld.  It's a must have.
B000002C2E|5.0|\\"Shadows are falling and I've been here all day<br />It's too hot to sleep time is running away<br />Feel like my soul has turned into steel<br />I've still got the scars that the sun didn't heal<br />There's not even room enough to be anywhere<br />It's not dark yet, but it's getting there\\"<br />The first verse of one of the greatest songs of all time found on this album. Mr. D shows that his sence of moral and humanity is gone down the drain. Bobby opens the album with the a song saying \\"I'm sick of love, but I'm in the thick of it. This kind of love, I'm so sick of it.\\" Love Sick, also one his finest of all time. The highlights of this album are Love Sick, Standing In The Doorway, Trying To Get Into Heaven, 'Til I Fell In Love With You, Not Dark Yet, Cold Irons Bound, Can't Wait, and Highlands. The entire album is a masterpeice. Essential for any colletion.
B000068IEU|5.0|I loved this movie.  Not only was the story good, but a lot of the scenes are very intense.  It's almost like your watching a documentary/snuff movie at some points. Excellent film! You gotta hand it to wes craven... he knows how to make good horror movies.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|does not make it bad!  <br /> <br />This show is completely amazing. I'm glad it's still maintaining a 5-star rating despite all the braintrusts that are giving it 1-star \\"reviews.\\" <br /> <br />It's very true that if you didn't get the appeal of \\"Buffy the Vampire Slayer\\" and/or \\"Angel,\\" you will probably hate \\"Firefly.\\" Let me put it this way: if you frequently need to have knock-knock jokes explained to you, you won't enjoy anything Joss Whedon does. If you're like me and you enjoy surprises and quirky, subtle humor with usually likable characters, then you, like me, will think that Joss is somewhat of a god.  <br /> <br />Or you could just listen to these types of reviews: \\"Poor screenwriting is killed this show.\\" Yes, do lets put a major typo in our review that criticizes someone else's writing. <br /> <br />Bottom line: Fox has made (many) mistakes in the past. (\\"Family Guy\\" anyone?) \\"Firefly\\" was another such mistake. It's a show that had two major strikes against it from the beginning. It had the crap-crappiest time slot ever, and it defies typical genres, which most of the below average public just can't understand or handle. <br /> <br />If only it had been a reality show! Then it would still be on and millions would sit mindlessly in front of their TVs to drool on themselves for an hour a week. Darn it all!
B00005AQE8|5.0|Tupac is the greatest rapper of all time!!!  There isn;t a single bad song on this CD.  It is probably one of the best rap albums of all time.  The way that Tupac combined great lyrics with great beats is beyond me.  He will officially go down in history as beind the best rapper of all time.  People will be saying Biggie Who?
B00020HEL6|5.0|When a vocalist's voice brings tears to my eyes, it has touched me too deeply to express.  All of the selections on the debut album are superb, but \\"Love That Will Last\\" is the absolute limit of spectacular to me.  I cannot believe those melodic sounds are produced by such a youthful being.  I congratulate and wish Renee the best forever in her vocal career.
0446677450|5.0|This is information prescribed to make decisions on your own.  Robert is disclosing thought processes that lead to; <br /> <br />one: staying where you are in life. <br /> <br />two: being aware of where you are, but providing paradigm shifts in mindset to get you going.  <br /> <br />three: setting goals, and few people do, you can reach them. <br /> <br />It's another way of applying Tony Robbins OPA (Outcome, purpose, action), know your outcome, have a purpose, realize when your action isn't working and make adjustments to reach your outcome into your financial mindset--it's as simple as that. If you haven't heard, read or listened to Tony Robbins do so now for clarity of your life and the potential available to you.   <br /> <br />Some of the thoughts regarding this book--other reviews, its quite clear to me now, and it just reinforces that people are simply lazy.  They continue ruminating the idea that there is a get rich quick sentiment in all these books, and that is where the negative is raised. All of these books are alternatives to what we think is quick and easy, but the fact is, life is meant to be enjoyed, and if your comfort is poor, middle class, rich, emotional, depressed, mad, sad or jealous and you decide to live there, its you and you only making that choice.  Robert is providing some very rewarding ways to realize in yourself that the self-defeating principle is you and only you.  If you maintain your current paradigm of thought and can live with it, so be it, but the constellation of power to grow is knowing that there are other choices out there.  Whether implimenting half volitions or whole ones, you can only blame yourself and no other leading a life completely in the unconscious state.  <br /> <br />There are only two disciplines when it comes to money; not enough and too much.  And if you come into allot of money but have been disciplined to manage not enough, record has it that most often these people go back to the category of people withnot enough. I don't have the numbers, and I cannot provide to you statistics off-hand regarding such, but that they are available--look them up and you'll find that I'm correct.  The key to life is to delay your gratification in order to reap greater rewards in the long term.  This is an indispensible prerequisite for success. And if you circumscribe your beliefs otherwise, if your life seems foiled, then so be it, but blame only you. <br /> <br />Robert isn't our Mother, he's just another generous guy sharing thoughts, providing keys to doors of wisdom within each of us. To believe or not to believe that is the question here.  Live with your own tired weary thoughts, but don't brood over his, even if you feel wary at the outset and pessimistic about the information within. If you feel a necessity to change, don't write the ideas off just yet, but realize them empirically before reducing them to dissonance. And even if they don't meet your outcome, you can embody the good and omit everything else, you'll strengthen your own character. There's clarity in this book regarding movement in our life, its a very easy and flowing read with great information, and I highly recommend it. <br /> <br />
B0006Z2LH4|3.0|I first watched 'Cube' in 1998 and thought the film uncommonly good (particularly for a Canadian low budget film). Did I ever think it needed a sequel, let alone a prequel? No! Ater seeing thi prequel (I have no desire to see the universally panned sequel) do I NOW think a prequel was in order? Not particularly, but the film was still half-way decent.  <br /> <br />First, Cube Zero is the kind of film, like Star Wars, Episode III, that is ONLY interesting IF you care about getting answers left by the film's predocessor(s). That is, if you did not see Cube, or if you saw Cube and did not find yourself bothered by questions about the Cube's purpose, etc, then you probably will not like this film. (I DID see Cube, and while I entertained questions about the Cube's backstory, I did so casually and fleetingly. Hence, 3 stars out of 5.) <br /> <br />Unlike Cube and Hypercube, Cube Zero takes us outside the actual cube, and into the control room, where we meet two of the Cube's employees. One, Eric, is soon to become our main character when he realizes that one of the unwitting 'players' inside the Cube does not deserve to be there. Eric decides to obey orders and enter the cube himself in order to get her out. Now, we get to see the cube from inside and out; Eric is trying to get out, and several 'executives' are trying to get to him: dead or alive.  <br /> <br />The good part about this film is that it was intelligent and captivating, just like the original. It also explains (or hints at) a decent amount of the Cube's backstory (though it does keep you guessing about a few things). Everything from what happens when a player reaches the 'exit' (the quotation marks are there for a reason, folks!) to why the character known as Kazan appeared in the original Cube film. Those who want at least some resolution to Cube will not be disappointed.  <br /> <br />That being said, let's get to the bad aspects of the film. As in the original Cube film, the script was quite bad, the acting was stiff, and the characters were unidimensional and cliche to the core. Quite honestly, if my curiosity towards the cube's backstory were not providing me with incentive to keep the film on, I'd have turned it off during the first half hour.  <br /> <br />So there it is; three stars. I still don't feel a prequel was necessary, but at least it was interesting.... to those of us who wanted backstory to Cube, that is. If that is you, this film will not disappoint. If not, look on.
B0006L16N8|2.0|After all the hype and everyone telling me how great this CD was I finally broke donw and got it.  Needless to say I was very dissappointed.  I really like \\"Speed of Sound\\" but the rest of the album is worthless IMO.  Every song sounds basically the same to me.  Just my 2 cents
0743490304|2.0|This book was the most boring of Brown's legacy. Forgettable characters, ill-written plot. Could skip this one if you may.
B0002OERI0|5.0|Alot of people are knocking this album because it's different from green day's older music.  The reason for this is some people just can't grow up.   i'm a fan (like most people) from back in the day when green day released dookie and insomniac.  Back then i wouldn't have listened to all the music i listen to now.  now i'll listen to almost anything from classic rock to billie joel to old green day to pennywise.  i've matured along with green day (from a music perspective) and I come to realize that some people haven't. These are the people who are knocking the band.  Maybe someday they will come to appreciate this album.  until then keep listening to dookie and enjoy bashing this album.
B0000AQS0F|4.0|I don't recall when I started watching Firefly on tv. But from the first episode that I saw, I fell in love with the crew and the ship and the story. On Buffy the Vampire Slayer and on Angel, I had favorite characters. And on the later Buffy seasons, I hated the Dawn character because I thought that she was a plot device to keep teenage boys hooked on the series. On Firefly, though, I enjoyed watching every crew member. Proud and loyal Captain Mal, trigger-tempered, opportunistic Jayne, quiet and fierce Zoe, playful and insecure Wash, warm and capable Kayley (sp?) as well as their passengers, Book, Inara, Simon and River all charmed me. I even liked seeing the ship, Serenity. When Buffy and Angel ended, I thought that there was a fitness about the shows' endings. The stories for each series had played out as far as I was concerned. But when Firefly was cancelled after only a few episodes, I felt cheated of the opportunity to learn more about the characters, the chance of seeing how the relationships would work out over the years. <br /> <br />So, I received the DVD and I expected to be pleased as I was. Why would I recommend that someone buy the DVD though? There are the three episodes that were never aired in my area anyway. Then there is the commentary and bonus clips added. But mostly I bought the DVD because I wanted the advertisers to see that there remained a Firefly following so that maybe another network would pick up the show or that a second movie followed the one coming out this September. Or failing on those scores, I would have the shows to watch whenever I wanted: I could imagine the evolution of the characters. Because this show ended before it had a chance to play out its depth, it's more precious to me - and hey, I am \\"just\\" a viewer, not the creative Mr. Whedon or the talented actors or the unseen people who contributed to the delightful program, \\"Firefly\\".
B000002GA8|5.0|And the one that introduced me to sinfo-prog rock in the first place.I remember how astonished I was at the use of synthesizers,at the majestic orchestrations,at the excellent narrator's dramatization,and of course at the incredible performance of all of the musicians,taking me into a musical journey into one of the books that inflienced me the most as a child,J.Verne's.The sound was incredible for an early<br /><br /> 70's album.I've owned this wonder in 4 track cartridge,cassette,lp,and now on cd.I hope I won't be able to wear it down like I did with the other formats.And next month I'm buying the DVD in spite of all the bad reviews.LONG LIVE THE MASTER !!!!

B00068NVI4|5.0|We caught this show at its Fort Lauderdale stop. Most amazing Yes concert I have ever seen (been to over 20), even though they didn't do Starship Trooper. This Concert is the quintessential sheer unadulterated, iconoclastic, decadence which every real Yes fan should cetainly appreciate.If you were fortunate enough to see the 1974 Tales of Topographic Oceans tour when this quintet first played together or saw the 1991 Union tour (in the round), you understand where I'm coming from. What A Set! Great staging and lighting! The sound mix is superb!  The sound on the Yes Symphonic DVD seems to have  warmer and richer quality. I love both DVD's. Compare the versions of Starship Trooper to each other. This treasure was well worth the wait!
B00005JMAH|5.0|We have two copies of this film. This film was true to the darkness of this HP book.  The special effects were right on the mark.  I think the kids did not disappoint and came through on some very difficult moments in the book.  This film is a favorite in our family.  I got a second one because my oldest (21) wants to take it back to college.  I am hoping the film coming out this fall will be just as good.
B0000DZTIW|5.0|I wasn't all that fussed about seeing the film at the cinema...but my friend had the DVD which I borrowed one Friday Night. The only way to describe the film and the music score is to say the film was great and the music OUTSTANDING. I love the way the music mirrors the film. Every time I listen to the CD I cannot help but to be moved by the music. Great stuff!  <br /> <br />ALSO RECOMMENDED: Mehdi ~ Instrumental Heaven Volume 7 ..A True Gem...Samples are at SoothingMusic,Com...Just Listen.  <br /> <br /> <br />
0793563836|5.0|How do you go from nothing to something? In learning an instrument, it's hard to replace a human teacher. While books can only compliment personalized feedback, this one is easily the best of it's genre. It provides a foundation of knowledge and technique, a logical progression, and allows for enough noodling to stay fun. There is enough variety in approach to accomodate many learning styles. In \\"about the author\\" I noticed that the Ed Friedland has a masters degree in education. Wow; a well organized musician that can teach. No wonder his book is the Shiz.
B00005JLKB|4.0|The First Season of Smallville is incredible. Some of the episodes are a little bit hard to believe. Some do get into a pattern. However there is a great story that is told.  <br />   Tom Welling is a perfect Clark Kent. Kristin Kreuk is absolutly beautiful in her performance of Lana Lang. Micheal Rosenbaum is a Lex Luther we can sympothize with and actually like. John Schneider (Dukes of Hazzard) is an incredible, but slightly overprotective Johnathan Kent. And Annette O'Toole, who played Lana Lang in Superman III, shines as the compasionate Martha Kent.  <br />   Smallville puts an interesting spin on the Superman Legend. If Clark landed in Smallville then there would logically be Kryptonion rocks everywhere. And in the comic book world it would logically alter people to have certain powers.  <br />    The writting and plot lines of Smallville is absolutly brillant. My favorite thing is making Lex Luther  an all around  nice guy and one of Clark's best friends. I love it in the episode when Lex says to Clark, \\" I promise you Clark, I'm not a criminal mastermind.\\" <br />     Season 1 may have some kinks in it, but it is still a great collection to own.

0385338686|5.0|Samantha Sweeting's life revolves around one thing: her law career. She has no time for herself, and she wouldn't have it any other way. When a partnership at her law firm is within her grasp, Samantha makes a HUGE mistake that could cost her her job. Panicked, Samantha flees London. She hops on a train with no destination in mind, not knowing what to expect.    Samantha ends up at a fancy home in the Cotswolds, and the owners mistakingly think she's the new housekeeper-for-hire. What's a girl to do? She can't very well go back to London, now that her life's a mess. So, she pretends to be a Cordon Bleu chef... even though she knows nothing about cooking. Samantha doesn't even know how to do her own laundry! But her new employers buy into her story... even though the handsome gardener, Nathaniel, is a skeptic.    \\"Undomestic Goddess,\\" is my first Kinsella book, and it hope it won't be my last. It's as perfect as chic lit can get. It's sweet, but not saccharine. It's funny, and it even brought a tear to my eye. A lesser author might've made Samantha seem like like a chronic liar who's completely out of her mind. But Kinsella makes her sympathetic. And Nathaniel (who I thought was a bit dispassionate at first--I was so wrong!) is everything a hero should be. Sure, the book's a bit far-fetched. But if you're reading chic lit, the last thing you want is a dose of reality.     I highly recommend this book!
B00025ETIW|1.0|Hi, I don't know if you know me or not, but I'm NOT your typical high school teenager. I have dyed black hair, and wear a tie with my punk clothes to show that I am a rebel. I listen to experimental music like My Chemical Romance, because they don't sing that stupid corporate rock like Britney Spears that all the fat-cats in Washington listen to. I'm about angst, so you should know that, I feel real deep anger at the world for all the suffering and torment I have been through, like when my parent's wouldn't drive me to Hot Topic to buy me these totally boss black shirts. You see, no one else wears black and acts angry, so I alone have to step up and fill the void. Whenever my parents get mad at me I yell in their faces, \\"I'm not okay!\\" and believe you me, they get the message.

B000002H6C|5.0|The recording/remastering of 'One' on the Metallica Videos DVD is fantastic - I now wonder if it is only a matter of time if/when the record co's can remaster this album and give it the muscular sound it so richly deserves - a sound/tone similar to Machine Head's 'The Blackening'.  The DVD version of 'One' is so powerful.  Here's hoping. My comments below still hold true though.    *********************    I write this in response to all the critical comments being levelled at the quality of the sound recording.  I think AJFA is a quintessential metal album from the pioneers of the thrash genre with well crafted, melodic and technically demanding guitar and drum sequences exploring themes of injustice, rage, anger and the futility of war.  For mine, this album ranks as the best that the Four Horsemen have produced and the sound recording rivals that of the Black album IMHO.  Be sure to play it loud through a quality high-end system (mine consists of top end Sony and Marantz equipment powering B&W towers) and you will not be disappointed.   The recording is crisp and clean with no distortion - similar to the Black album. Arguably, this album represents the pinnacle of Metallica's creativity and penchant for writing/playing technically demanding and interesting metal.  While the Load sessions are good albums and the music undeniably Metallica, I respect them for evolving their musical creativity but AJFA still reigns as their best.  An easy 5 stars is therefore awarded.

B00000K3CM|5.0|Macaulay Culkin is seperated from his family again but this time he's in the big apple New York. How it happen. The family wera plainning a christmas facation to Miami, Florida everybody else went on the right plane at the air port except for Macaulay character (Kevin) cause he was putting new batteries in his tape recorder after that he was flowing a man who had the same jacket as his dad that man was going catching the plane to New York and that's how Kevin got confused and got on the wrong plane. Luckly for him he had his dads bag filled with money and credit cards which can help him live and check into a hotel in NYC. Kevin is also smart enough to have his own plane ticket to Florida just in cast a mistake happen's again which it did. The same two bad guys from the first movie use to be called the \\"wet Bandets\\" now the \\"sticky bandets\\" nave escape from jail into NYC.
B0000009S3|1.0|My neighbor used to play this album quite a bit, and it incessantly irritated me to no end. This was a time when it seemed to be fashionable or hip to be \\"into\\" Frank Zappa rather than because it was realistically good music-which it was not, in my opinion. Again, this was Frank Zappa bamboozling legions of fans into feeling that his extraneous music signified  something strangely alluring was happening. Unfortunately, for me, his opus proved only to be what amounted to being a musical auditory illusion. He reminds me of another abysmally untalented \\"artist\\" named Andy Warhol, who had many of New York's gullible elite believing that there was something wonderfully artistic about a picture of a Campbell's Soup can. In fact, Frank Zappa should be remebered as the Andy Warhol of the music world.
B00005JNSK|5.0|I don't understand how anyone can say this movie was bad.  I read many reviews before going to see this with my six-year old daughter (who loved it and agrees that it is better), and I was prepared to possibly prefer the first one. WRONG! I absoloutely LOVED this movie from beginning to end. Johnny Depp did a fantastic job as the eccentric Willy Wonka, and he had the funniest lines.\\"Good Morning Starshine. The earth says \\"Hello.\\" Gene Wilder played it more straight and in comparison was BORING! OK, so maybe Depp's was a bit effemanate and odd(Which is the only two reasons I can see that he is being compared to Michael Jackson.) Other than that, the comparison is ridiculous. I have to agree with other reviewers that it was obvious that he didn't like children which everyone knows is not the case with Jackson. It's not like he opened his factory every day for children to play in. Even when he did open it, it was out of a particular need (to find an heir) and he was very specific about what they were allowed to touch. One thing that always bothered me about the original is that it was never explained why Wonka was so odd and hostile towards the children (other than the fact that most of them were brats). So the insights into his childhood and young adulthood adventures through the flashbacks were one of the main things I liked about this version. It also made sense that he had that strange gray pallor to his skin because he was such a recluse and didn't get any sun (another reason for the Jackson thing perhaps?) Not that Jackson doesn't get out, but he is rather pale. (Yes, I know about the skin bleaching). I do wish they hadn't put so much make-up on him. (Depp, I mean.) He didn't talk like Michael Jackson at all. He sounded like Carol Channing a lot, though. I thought this was odd, but perhaps intentional. Maybe he just didn't know how to talk to children, so he put on this false high-pitch voice. It was especially noticable when he was nervous.(That nervous laugh).That was also the reason that he used cue cards. C'mon people, he lived  with tiny orange men for 20 years. I think anyone would be a little odd under those circumstances. And look at his childhood. His father, in particular. I won't say anything more for those that haven't seen it. See it, and you'll know what I mean. No wonder he had trouble with the word \\"parent.\\"   I also have to add, because nobody else mentioned it(I don't think.) that there is no Slugworth in this movie. That may dissapoint some people, but he was not neccesary to the plot. The children were rotten and greedy already (except for Charlie of course) and didn't need someone to egg them on to be even more so. In my opinion, this character was used for the original movie so that it was be more acceptable for Charlie and Grandpa Joe to do something naughty (fizzy lifting drinks) and then redeem himself later by being the only one to give up his everlasting gobstopper.Slugworth is mentioned in the book only as one of the candy-maker spies who stole his ideas. Also, I thought that Wonka was much too harsh on Charlie when he shouted at him and Grandpa Joe like he did. Obviously, he was upset that the day was wasted, but children might not realize that and think he was just being mean. And how did he know what Charlie and Grandpa did? He was in the other room showing the kids the geese that laid chocolate eggs. That made him mysterious I guess, but I think too confusing for kids. Slugworth worked for Wonka anyway, which also doesn't make sense. Why did he trust him? He was free to leave the factory. How did he know that he wouldn't try to steal his ideas? Depp's Wonka was a lot more cautious and followed Dahl's wonderful book almost exactly. Even his clothes and body type look like the illustrations. I also have to add, that I didn't miss the corny singing as much as I thought I would after reading it was not a musical. The oompa loompa's and their songs were far better than the first movie. The wordsfor most of the songs were taken from the book(read it, and see) and were a lot funnier and less tedious  than that annoying \\"OOMPA LOOMPA DOOPITY DO\\". It was just the same tune over and over. While this version, each song was unique and I found myself looking forward to each new song and dance number. They were incredibly entertaining. This movie, with today's technology, really brought Dahl's imagination to life and did the story more justice. If you only know the story from this movie and/or the original version, do yourself and your kids a favor and READ THE BOOK. Then, see both movies and then you'll understand why this new version is the best. You may also want to read \\"Charlie and the Great Glass Elevator\\". A sequel book that would make a great sequel movie. With Depp and the rest of the cast of course. Great casting, by the way. Oh, one more thing I have to add: Wonka didn't like children with one exception of course:Charlie. In the end Charlie was the only one he trusted and they became best friends. I think Charlie made a real difference in his life and brought him out of his shell. So this movie has a lot to say (if you are paying attention) about kindness and not being too quick to judge others. Charlie was the only one who cared enough about Wonka to ask him about his life and he asked intelligent questions. He is an excellent role model for children. Freddie Highmore should be proud. He really brought the character to life. In short, my family and I were drawn into this movie from the beginning and were never bored. I never saw my daughter sit so still in a theater before. I think that says a lot.
B0000065O1|5.0|I am still a faithful user of Cindy's first tape \\"Shape Your Body\\" 10 years after it's original release but I will say The Next Challenge is superior in many ways to the first one.  This workout is long - an hour total but it is an hour well spent if you are serious about toning up your body.  A lot of the excercises are taken from different sports so you will be kicking like you're in karate class, doing skating moves like you're in an ice rink and squatting like you're a sumo wrestler.  The good parts about the Next Challenge are that Cindy performs the excercises much slower than the first video, her form is better and there are times allotted for taking water breaks and resting.  She explains the moves in depth and gives tips on what you should do to make sure you are performing the excercises correctly to avoid injuring yourself.  She also gives slight alterations to make the excercises easier for those who have bad backs, etc. Radu is still present in this video but less so than the first.  The music is great and the editing is somewhat like a MTV type thing but I find that it helps to keep the tapes interesting after all these years of doing them.  My favorite part about this video is the chest excercises. They are floor excercises which is nice because you get a long break to lay down and the results you will get from the excercises is amazing.  Everything in this video is challenging, your heart gets pumping in the beginning cardio section and you keep putting out an serious effort from then on.  I highly recommend The Next Challenge (as well as Shape Your Body) if you want a results producing workout routine that you will not bore of easily.
B0000AQVCL|3.0|First of all the critic who works for amazon should find a new line of work because he obviously knows very little about music. First of all the track \\"Look What You've Done\\" is not Oasis-y. Oasis is a terrible band that completely ripps many chord progressions used by the Beatles as did Jet on this track. Look What You've Done is a complete rip of the Beatles' \\"Sexy Sadie\\", lyrically and musically. The piano riff is very lennonesque. Either way it is still a good album. Originality is hard to come by these days.
B000026FOA|5.0|It seems like Nick Drake came out of nowhere when he arrived on the music scene in the late 1960s. His music sounds like nothing that came before it and no matter how many people try, no one will ever be able to match the pure genius of his work. Although all of his albums are never less than fantastic, \\"Five Leaves Left\\" is probably the most cohesive and best presents his  complete artistic statement. Drake's songs are truly magical. His harmony is always unique and unusual but never too complicated to  allow his technical mastery as a composer and guitarist to control the simple, understated beauty of his songs. His lyrics are mysterious and seem to come from another world. You could analyze them to death but the best way to experience the power of his music is to simply LISTEN and absorb it all without question...somehow you know what he's singing about and all else in the world simply seems unimportant...The string arrangements on this recording are ALWAYS tasteful and add another layer of tortured beauty to Drake's mellow and morose songs. His voice sounds peaceful and has a complete lack of anger or hate. Although all of his songs are masterpieces, highlights include \\"Cello Song,\\" \\"Saturday Sun,\\" \\"River Man\\" and \\"Thoughts of Mary Jane.\\" EVERYONE should listen to Nick Drake.

B00003CXA2|1.0|Tom Hanks is an odd fellow. On the one hand, he's perfectly likeable in, say, Road To Perdition, oozes charm in, say, Big, but then there are times you could happily run him over with a car. Castaway is a good example, but surely the best example has to be this - 2 and a bit hours of Idiot Does Good. And 2 and a bit hours of the most sentimental, mawkish U-S-A! U-S-A! drivel you'll ever see.<br /><br />Reasons to hate this movie.<br /><br />1. Forrest Gump himself. Tom Hanks thinks playing someone who is mentally slow equals having big wide eyes and, er, well, that's pretty much it. And saying really stupid, but supposed to be cute, things (\\"my name's Forrest Gump. People call me Forrest Gump)\\".  Ha ha ha, oh how witty. Doesn't he just warm your hearts, ladies and gentlemen? Eh, no.<br /><br />2. The humourous coincidences throughout the movie. One would have been fine, a nice little knowing, \\"ahhhh\\", but Forrest unknowningly invents so many things (phrases, logo's) you half expect him to get zapped back in time to invent the wheel. It's stupid and corny.<br /><br />3. Pulp Fiction.. that's PULP. FICTION was beaten to the Oscars by THIS syrup-laden, twee \\"all is well.. all is well..\\" crud-fest.

0060523794|4.0|Who Says Elephants Can't Dance?<br /><br />Who says an arrogant guy can't write a helpful book?<br /><br />There are a lot of people who don't like this book.  Some don't like it, because they perceive Lewis V. Gerstner as arrogant.  Some don't like it, because his tenure at IBM saw thousands of people lose their jobs.  Some don't like it, because they don't think there is anything new here.  I like this book.<br /><br />I like the book, because it is one of the most cogently and personally presented stories I've seen of a major corporate turnaround by the person who was in the CEO's job at the time.  Here's a quick outline of the story.<br /><br />Gerstner became Chairman and CEO of IBM in April, 1993.  At that time, IBM, once the icon of American management, was in big trouble.  The deathwatch was on.  The conventional wisdom among the pundits was that IBM needed to be broken up and sold off piece by piece to create lots of small businesses that would create income for shareholders.<br /><br />This was the heyday of the dot com boom.  Smaller, networked computers were expected to rule the future. Big mainframe computers, the stuff that IBM sold, were supposed to be the troglodytes of American business, and heading for extinction.<br /><br />Gerstner came to IBM after being a McKinsey consultant and after a successful eleven-year career at American Express, and four years as Chairman and CEO of RJR Nabisco.  He describes what he calls \\"the courtship\\" that brought him to IBM in the beginning of this book.<br /><br />The company he took over was once seen as the very model of the best in management.  When I was starting out in business some thirty-five years ago, we looked to IBM as an exemplar of all that was good, effective and profitable.  In 1982, Peters and Waterman featured IBM in \\"In Search of Excellence,\\" with a long list of references in the index.<br /><br />But by the time Gerstner took over many of the things that had made IBM great had fossilized. Many of the practices that had been touchstones had turned into radioactive rocks.<br /><br />Gerstner started off with three critical challenges.  He needed to stop the hemorrhaging of cash and stabilized the company.  He needed to learn enough about the business and the people he had walked into to make good strategic choices.  And he needed to put together a strategy to turn IBM around.<br /><br />This book tells us about how he did all of those things.  It does so candidly and that's one of the reasons I like the book.<br /><br />While lots of people see Gerstner as arrogant, I found him, at least in this book, to be humble.  That doesn't mean that he didn't think he had a lot to offer and had made lots of good decisions.  It does mean that he understood that many of his decisions didn't work out the way he thought, and some of his ideas weren't the best.  Those get play, too, and that's rare in a book like this.<br /><br />I also appreciated the refreshing style of the book.  It was not written with a ghostwriter or co-author.  Gerstner did it himself.  The language may not be the language that a professional writer would have chosen.  But it is the language that's common to businesspeople everywhere, and that makes this a good read.<br /><br />The big advantage of this is that we get a real view inside the head of someone who led a successful corporate turnaround. We don't get a view that's filtered through a collaborator.<br /><br />Because Gerstner wrote the book, it's short on some of the details that might be here if a business historian or journalist did the writing.  For my money, that's OK, because this is a real inside view.<br /><br />This book is for you if you want a lucid discussion of a difficult turnaround process by the CEO who did the CEO's job.  It is all of that and a good read besides.ad fossilized.

This song, obviously written about the fall of Communism (and, even more likely, the Berlin Wall), coincided with me dealing with a big change in my life-going from grade school to high school.
B00005JNBQ|2.0|Unless you are thirteen, I doubt you'll like this movie very much.  I watched it with some teens who loved it.  It seems to be a \\"cult\\" movie amongst teens.  My 14-year old can quote many lines from the movie.  A love-it or hate-it movie, as you can tell from the reviews.<br /><br />It looks at the life of a few teenagers in a small town.  You will recognize some stock characters from your own high school days.  The movie pitilessly shows how small and pathetic these people's lives are.  The only scene with any real interest is Napoleon's dance.  You'll have to watch it to understand.<br /><br />There are a few humorous lines.  I got a couple of chuckles out of it; but that's about it.  Sort of like shoveling all the horse-s**t to get at the pony that must be in there somewhere.  No pony here -- just one of those orange \\"Pokey\\" bendy-figures :)<br /><br />Parents may find this movie interesting and informative from a cultural standpoint:  you may figure out what some of the things your kids are saying mean.  Might be worth a rental for that reason.<br /><br />Greatest movie?  Idiots!  Gosh!

All classic live rock albums from its Golden Age.  Think they weren't listening to each other?!? <br /> <br />Don't listen to Harsh Reviewer--clearly an idiot.
0684803356|2.0|I was excited to read my first Hemmingway book. I labored through the extremely cumbersome and boring narratives hoping that eventually it would pay off, unfortunately it never did. I know it's fiction and everything but the way Hemmingway has Pilar describe past events for pages and pages is very unrealistic. The book finally gets good about 34 Chapters into it whith the raid on El Sordo's band which is the highlight of the book. Maria is annoying. The narrative is confusing. If you are looking for a classic I recommend skipping this book. I plan on reading \\"The Old Man and the Sea\\" next. Hopefully Hemmingway will redeem himself in that book. I honestly do not see why people consider this a classic. It was a waste of time.

Facts abound, facts about tigers, rations on lifeboats ... and also a terrific opening ambit.  In the middle of the sea, you burn in the sun and then get a taste of tiger dung.  The facts begin to blur, you can't say if he's being real about it. <br /> <br />It's not very clear about whether it's first person or third, a bit of both.  Identifying Pi in Canada. <br /> <br />You can read and read this and then it becomes silly, ghastly.  Floating green islands with acid lakes at night.  You think, why can't he give me a credible story please? <br /> <br />But then you are revealed in your own mirror, why should he?  He can damn well write what he likes and here I am reading it. <br /> <br />I thought it a brilliant, well presented book.  Just be prepared for a little disappointment after being adrift forever with such laborious details while out in the open ocean, under the sun. <br /> <br />Easy to read, genius author and well, a wonderful appetizer.

His carrer is going down the drain after this and Alexander. Jennifer Garner is ok as Elecktra, I expected more from her. The only character I liked wasn't even in the movie only in the director's cut. Coolio is funny as the man on trial and has a funny line in it. Joe Pantoliano is also good as the reporter. But they can't save a bad movie that was bad enough already.

Although different than their concerts from the late '80's and early '90's (as one should expect), Jon, as always, has the crowd singing along, dancing, and waving their arms in unison (and not so unison at times, lol) even though it was pouring rain and the fans (and some of the band) were getting soaked as he exhibited his expertise as front man that he does so well. If you are looking for the origional (CD) versions and not variations or \\"strays\\" of their songs (especially their infamous hits from yester-year), this is not the CD that will provide that (though you shouldn't be disappointed). Just note variations mostly, the rockers are still rockers with only 1 exception that I can think of - and I especially loved the \\"Runaway\\" rendition - it was a hauntingly beautiful ballad that blew me away and I'd buy this DVD again for that song alone. Just as their self stated anthem \\"Just Older\\" is all about I think that Bon Jovi's music reflects on their maturity as a band and it especially reflects on their musical talent and genius. The fact that they are now playing to 2 generations of audiences, many of which thought \\"Crush\\" was their first CD, is fantastic and says a lot for the band and their talent by their ability to appeal to more than the \\"just older\\" crowd (just check out all of the young faces in the crowd absolutely thrilled to be there in the rain). I also thought it was cool that the concert was also broadcast over the radio, I sure wish bands did that here. They played 19 songs total (I rarely went to a concert where the band played 19 songs - especially in the rain! - and I've been to quite a few concerts in the past), with a 3 song encore (\\"Keep The Faith\\" rocked!). An awesome fire works show at the end of the concert as the band leaves while \\"Thank You For Loving Me\\" plays in the background... a nice touch for theending. Also interviews, pictures, and more on the DVD. Get it while you can, it's well worth it! Jon, Richie, David, Tico, Hugh... my hat's off to you all!  I wish I could have been there!
B0006SSOHC|5.0|I was so shocked and absorbed the first time I saw this film. It was really good. I actually jumped at a few times. I wish I saw this in theaters instead of The Grudge (Not really good). The characters and story were really good all the way through the spellbinding ending. The actors are great in their roles especially Cary Elwes, Danny Glover, Monica Potter, and newcomer Leigh Whannell (he also wrote the screenplay). Saw is a tour de force and gives a new edge on a thriller. Highly Recommended.
B00065JTBA|5.0|I watched the DVD before listening to the music, and I recommend that to anyone who purchases this set also. It gives you insight to \\"where Bon Jovi was\\" at the time they wrote/recorded the songs and gives you a little history behind them.  A great DVD to have with a lot of history of their music with insight into the band, the members... just some great info.    As for the music... never has a boxed set been released like this, and only Bon Jovi would have thought of it. There are sooooooo many songs here, great quality sound too. Unreleased songs that never made it onto albums they were written for, B-sides, a few origional demos - about 40 never before heard songs. For you die-hard old time \\"I have to hear the origional version of the older songs *just* like they are on the CDs or the song sucks\\" Bon Jovi fans, this set has a lot of music that will bring you back to yester-year. For the newer fans, this will give you a fantastic idea of why Bon Jovi has been around for 20 years and will probably be a band that *your* kids listen to just like mine do now. For you more open minded Jovi fans who don't mind growing with the band... you'll kick yourself if you pass on this one and *not* just for the origional demo versions of a few of their released songs.    I have pretty much every Bon Jovi album/DVD ever produced, and with all of these unreleased treasures, it's a wonder why they didn't produce a couple more CD's over the years since they write roughly 30 tracks for every CD they produce. Hopefully they'll dig into their vault again in the future and treat us with another box set of unreleased songs. Jon's incredible voice is like no other and he constantly impresses me with their music and his singing talent, but I'd also love to hear more of Tico on vocals with his deep, raspy voice. He has an almost Louis Armstrong sort of quality to his voice which I like a lot, and the avenues the band could explore with his voice could be really interesting to say the least,and also more of David on vocals too - he blew me away completely. I have one of Richie's CDs, so I know how good he is, but Tico and David were a real treat to hear.  I could go on and on, but I think you guys get the idea that this is a GREAT CD set, and a Bon Jovi fan MUST have! It really deserves more than 5 stars!
B00005JN2Z|5.0|This movie was very different then anything I have ever seen. Tom Cruise is awesome as a bad guy and should play them more often. Jamie Foxx is extremely great as the title character and hero in this film. This film is character study between a hitman and a cab driver and how they change while the movie progresses. The scenes between Cruise and Foxx are rich and refreshing. Michael Mann's direction is also spellbinding. My favorite scene is when Max(Foxx) has had enough of Vincent(Cruise). Mark Ruffalo (he's a real good actor), Jada Pinkett Smith, Peter Berg, and Bruce McGill(D-Day from Animal House!) are great in their characters as well. Highly Highly Recommended.
B000059PR5|5.0|It's a shame that not since this movie was originally shown 22 years ago has there been a comparable epic either made or shown. This was a classic example of the Playhouse 90/Armstrong Circle Theater drama done on a larger scale. The simple fact that a topically themed, politically oriented TV movie got 100 million people in the US to watch it alone shows you how different we and TV are now. There is no chance that anything like this could be done now - mostly because the craven networks would never forego the commercial income, since there were no commercials in the last 2/3 of this program. <br /> <br />And it was scary and hard hitting, with a lot of scenes that still resonate with me today: <br />The cheering college football crowd, hearing the launch warning claxons and looking up to see one, two, many missles headed into the stratosphere and going silent; <br />Steve Guttenberg marching in the \\"nuclear winter\\"; <br />A guy trying to get home to his (pregnant) girlfriend on his BMW motorcycle which stops dead after the EMP from the blast - then he gets vaporized (his skeleton is seen..); <br />And the inevitable scene of a marauding group of thugs looking to steal anything left - and killing an honest farmer willing to help them. <br /> <br />You would have to be transported back to the psycho-ward Reagan era with his buffoons talking about \\"winnable nuclear wars\\" and how you could survive a nuclear explosion by digging a shallow trench and covering yourslef with a door (?!)to properly understand this epic. No military man with a brain EVER believed there was or will be a \\"survivable\\" nuclear war. Some of the generals might have said it, but none of the grunts ever believed it. We knew better, that it was all bull***t. The question we always asked was: WHY survive a nuclear war?  <br /> <br />This TV movie deserved never to have been on TV in the first place, but Hollywood for all its reputed \\"liberal\\" (hah!) stands didn't and wouldn't have the guts to put something like this in a theater.  <br /> <br />For a real scare, forget \\"Nightmare On Elm Street\\". Try this movie instead and see if you sleep well that night.... <br />
B00001U0DP|5.0|This story is so moving and full of emotion.  It's a story about the holocaust and the joy that an optimistic father gives to his son.  It shows how to make the best out of any situation you are in.
B00005JMAH|5.0|I enjoyed this movie.  The students dressed and acted like real teenagers.

B00004R7TP|5.0|I grew up on Kate Bush's music food, and today it still nourishes the soul. Somebody please give it up for the maestros Paddy and John Carder Bush whose phenomenal extraordinary skill with musical instruments, vocals and sheer orchestral skill add the unforgettable taste that Kate's music has. My favourite tracks are - all of them, but in particular the haunting sound of Watching You Without Me, and the contrasting Beautiful, lively Celtic sound of Jig of Life. If you're serious about serious music, Buy it and also The Red Shoes, Kick Inside, and Never Forever.
B0002Z9HT8|5.0|Fantastic performances, fantastic sound.  Have played the DVDs while entertaining and people become glued to the TV when watching the performances.  Never new a concert video could be so great!
B0000C6E4D|1.0|the tambourines , the uptempo, the cimballs are all lame. her voice is not good anymore, and shes cheap with 30 minutes of music on the cd. that why peeps dont like pay full price anymore for half a cd. <br />you wouldn't of mine if it was good but its awefull  sound on my head. my dog using it as a frisbee, and i as wine glass coaster. <br /> <br />she's lost the reigning title of calypso queen.
B000001G53|3.0|It's hard to find a \\"perfect\\" Wagnerian recording, that much is certain. Much like the hunt for a perfect Ring Cycle, or perhaps even a perfect Flying Dutchman if you reach far back into Wagner (I've yet to find the perfect one, the match-up being between the Solti and the Klemperer), finding a perfect Parsifal is hard. Let's see how they match up: <br /> <br />KNAPPAERTSBUSCH: His recording during the Wieland Wagner production (early 1950's, I forget the exact year) features the \\"New Bayreuth\\" class of singers in their prime. Jess Thomas as the title role was brilliant, as were Gustav Neidlinger as Klingsor and Hans Hotter as Gurnemanz. Excellent playing by the Bayreuthers in the pit, but the choral work was the definite weak link. The performance as a whole was very organic and moving, and an excellent choice if you want just one Parisfal. <br /> <br />SOLTI: Solti has a history of producing \\"solid\\" Wagnerian performances, to quote several other reviewers on the site. \\"Solid\\" can be taken in either the positive or the negative; positive as the orchestral playing is generally very good and the singing is usually top-notch (the casting for Solti recordings alone makes them desirable). Parsifal is no exception, and is in almost all aspects one of Solti's finest (if not the finest) Wagner recording. Rene Kollo gives a fine performance as Parsifal, though I must admit I see him more as a Walther than a Parisfal. Gottlob Frick, who gave a wonderful performance as Hagen in the Solti Ring (as well as a great Fasolt in the Knappaertsbusch 1956 Bayreuth Ring) is an odd but ultimately good choice for Gurnemanz. Christa Ludwig gives her best, as usual, in the role of Kundry. The VPO, the usual Wagnerian Solti gang, is top-notch as usual. My personal choice for a first-time Parisfal recording to any newcomers. <br /> <br />KARAJAN: I often quote Stewart Spencer in calling most of Karajan's Wagner recordings as \\"lyrical cosmos\\". To put it bluntly, Karajan vies for the beauty rather than the drama in Wagner's works. His Ring Cycle especially, while sublimely beautiful in every way, lacked the drama behind the Solti or Knappaertsbusch or Bohm. His Parsifal recording, being Wagner's most \\"lyrical cosmos\\"-ish opera, makes Karajan's style of reading more appropriate. His choice of singers is good in some ways, bad in others. Kurt Moll, one of my favorite operatic singers, gives a typically wonderful reading as Gurnemanz. Jose van Dam is good as Amfortas. Peter Hoffman, however hard he tries, cannot live up to Jess Thomas or even Rene Kollo. The BPO gives one of the best readings of the Prelude I've ever heard. <br /> <br /> <br />In conclusion, it comes down to a matter of dramatic taste. If you want a dramatic recording, go for the Kna - it's a live recording with good quality. If you want a dramatic stereo recording, the Solti. If you want a more lyric, beautiful recording but at the cost of drama, get the Karajan if you are so inclined. There are other Parsifal recordings out there, such as other Knappaertsbusch or the Bouelz or Barenboim, but I've never listened to them so I cannot give an opinion on them. If I had to choose one, however, I would choose the Solti as a first-time Parisfal recording.
B0007GAERG|1.0|when i heard mariah was coming out with a new album i rushed to the record store to get it.  <br />I was very upset with how Glitter, Charm like a bracelette, and the movie bombed, so i was very upset at the low notch things shes been putting out.  <br /> <br />I put the cd on and i started to cry. it a aweful noise i was hearing.  <br /> <br />I dont know what to think anymore. she let me down again and again, release after release. everythime i keep saying maybe the next time, maybe the next time. gone are her day dream days. Celine is the new day dream voice, and Celine is a lot sweeter too. So she may be good but i have migrated over to Celine's camp. And Celine's show in las vegas is amazing! Go see it if you get a chance. It will change your life! props to Celine

B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Finally, Titanic will get the DVD treatment it deserves. This will be a three disc set. The single disc version was just the movie and trailer. This will include deleted scenes, making of features, and hopefully TV spots and all trailers. Some of the deleted scenes were on a CD rom James Cameron released a few years ago. These include scenes on board the rescue ship Carpahtia, more footage of passengers in lifeboats and on the sinking Titanic, and a diffrent version of the scene when old Rose goes to the stern of Brocks ship to drop the necklace into the sea. Can't wait for this to come out.
B000026OHN|4.0|I first read about this performance in Jim Svejda's now out of print book where he called it a remarkable trip through the Bach canon, full of unusual insights.<br /><br />Since that time I've heard a handful of WTCs (Gould, Barenboim, Hewitt) and would say this one is different from all those. Richter can be just as musical as any, equally as romantic, and can demonstrate all Gould's remarkable prestidigitation (see Book 1, Preludes 11 or 14).<br /><br />What is different about Richter's journey is method, his stream of consciousness, if you will, that permeates almost all these small gems. Richter seems to be thinking the music more than interpreting it. He does not often romanticize and is not always the great lyricist, playing the Book 1 Prelude 7 at a pace that I thought was too rapid for its gentle lyric.<br /><br />But as soon as I'm ready to revolt, Richter's remarkable musical intelligence draws me in, consuming me in the music and assuaging any misgivings I may have. He is best in the best music this group has to offer in the more cerebral Book 2.<br /><br />Richter loved Bach and played his music often throughout his lengthy career, leaving many recordings to us in good sonics. His Bach at the end of his life -- often captured in live performances on the Live Classics label -- had a great deal in common with his work in this body of music.<br /><br />Unlike most of Richter's recorded legacy from the 1960s and 1970s -- which were full of fire and temperament -- these are characterized by the tendencies of his later life: broadly paced, deeply thought, and almost visionary performances where the pianism is an intelligent extension of the score with few Baroque ornaments.<br /><br />The 1970 recordings were made in and may owe to the relative poor reproduction in the digital new century. The sound is also variable, going from clear and deep in one sonata to foggy and dry in the next. None of this diminishes the impact of Richter's pianism on this great music, however.great music, however. <br /> <br />
B00005U122|5.0|Yes yes of course!! Just spend your money and get your hands on this one.  One of the best concert performances that I have seen and this will be in the top 5 of my 'best concert DVD ever' list! I have never seen Floyd live, however watching this, its not hard to understand who was the real boss ..  <br />One word about the 5.1 mix: outstanding.   <br />Great stuff! 6.5 stars!!
0380788624|4.0|Stupid treasure hunters. They dig up all these \\"Japanese tunnels\\", disturbing priceless forest habitat, and leave behind a huge mess for the local community. Just got back from 3 weeks of fieldwork in the Philippines so I'm not making up that rant... <br /> <br />That said, this is a good fun book. It's a geek-boy fantasy with puzzles to solve, gold to find, and a hot tough chick like a computer game heroine. More like playing through a game than reading a novel, but definitely good entertainment.
B0006213H6|5.0|this has to be my personal favorite sigur ros album, () is hands down their best put together, but this is one of those albums that is great for listening to late at night when your lying in bed unable to sleep. the ambience is beyond discreet, barely any of the tracks can actually be considered \\"Songs\\", more like atmospheric sounds and noise (and screams) this album is more considerably on an ep scale for its \\"song\\" production, as there only about 5-6 tracks that could be considered under that category.<br /><br />If your looking for a cd to pop in the car trip or while your hangin with your buddies, than look elsewhere, if your diehard expecting something more along the melodic lines of Agaetis Byrjun (my least favorite) look elsewhere as well, but if you want something for the headphones to lay back and blast off into space with, than this is the album for you.
B000001IPP|1.0|I've grown tired of what people are telling me is punk. Evidentally if you dress in all black and mope around all the time you are punk. You also have to pierce yourself a lot and pretend you don't like things the rest of society likes. Cry me a river. That to me isn't punk at all. I'm so punk it's hard to believe. I walk out of my house most mornings in a baby blue leisure suit, burger king crown and sperry topsiders. I then ride a big wheel to work that I've modified to fit my growth. I ride my big wheel on the interstate with people honking at me. Do I care? No, because I'm what punk is really about. Punk is about doing something no one else does, not wearing black makeup. Punk is walking through a drive thru and ordering some rancid sauerkraut in an ice cream cone. When they tell you they don't have it, you scream like a banshee into their speaker until the worker's ears bleed. When the manager comes out, you start quacking like a duck and running windsprints. That my friends is punk.
B0008ISM40|4.0|This is the first album I've ever purchased by Nine Inch Nails and I am very impressed.  I'd downloaded the popular songs a couple of years ago, but after I heard \\"The Hand That Feeds\\" I was convinced I needed to get this album.  I understand most fans compare this to the previous albums, but since I'm new to the band I only look at this as a album and songs I've heard before.  There are some great hooks on this record and it's even cooler that Dave Grohl provided his sticks on a couple songs.  \\"Sunspots\\" and \\"The Line Begins To Blur\\" are among my personal favorites.  Overall I really like this album and will be likely to purchase another Nine Inch Nails album.  Trent Reznor has a knack for creating some good stuff.
0790729970|4.0|Could you image if you have an opportunity to have a wonderful mask which you could do however you want? The novel\\"Mask\\" was made a popular film, bese on the screenplay by Milk Werb who is a books writer. The novel tells more details than the film ans explains how the mask makes a person's life more significant. Plus it explains how the movie actor, Jim Carey made the movie more spontaneous. In addition, the movie would battles evil gangs with wacky power. <br />  In the beginning of the story, Stanley was a nice, polite person, has a boring life. That is, it is a big reward for him because ha has a chance to found as ancient mask in a riverbank. Amazingly, he seems like a totally different person when he put the mask on his face. Likewise, he has became more humorous. Further, he had an indestructible body that he could do something people are not able to do. For instance, his heart shoots out of his chest when he saw the one of sexeist woman Tina and bug out his eyes. <br />   Also, the actor in the movie was very spontaneous for his role because he has a nice body language that makes audience has the desire to know what's going on of the content. Moreover, I am so impress because it is not really hard to read the novel, they used a lot of interesting words to describe each role in this movie that made me more comfortable to read it. <br />   In my view, I advise everybody have to see the novel not just for kids or teens. Further, we ought to relax for our mood because everybody get the preasure too much from our noemal life, so I recommend to get the novel that will makes your mood more comfortable. Truly, the writer in this book used a lot of wonderful words to describe Jim Carey's character. <br />  In short, I would like to rate the novel 8 for the score because I thought it not only just a movie of comedy, but also let people to know that everybody has the rigth to makes their life more significant and terrific. Accordingly, I am full of courage to face any challenge and problem in the future as Jim Carey in the movie did. <br />
B00005JMYI|5.0|Alright. Where can I begin? Well, let's just say that Anchorman is probably the funniest movie to ever be shown on the big screen. From the moment we see Brick shoving mayo into a toaster to the special features (ESPN audition and all), I never stopped laughing. Anchorman is filled with non-stop, completely quotable lines (\\"You are so wise. You're like a miniature Buddah covered in hair\\"). True, it can be a little racy at points, but in the end, Anchorman is a winner. Look for amazing cameos by Luke Wilson and Ben Stiller!
B000067J1H|1.0|The previous reviewers are all good people who obviously love cinema. <br /> <br />That said, this movie is really pretty terrible.  I most sympathize with the reviewer who said that it wasted two hours of her life. <br /> <br />Honestly, folks, what is it about?  The acting and cinematography are excellent.  The dialogue is that \\"quirky and edgy\\" garbage that passes for \\"Literary\\" writing these days.  (Read Hemingway to learn how people actually talk.) <br /> <br />But the plot is mindless.  It's all about showing off how progressively weirder you can pile things up as a writer, but it is just plain nonsense.   It reeks of Iowa School plotting.  Or Irvine.  Which is the only part of California technically located in Iowa. <br /> <br />Rent \\"The Station Agent\\" and see what a really good script can do for a really low budget movie.   <br /> <br />The stuff in here, man...I about threw up.  I kept waiting for a payoff, but it was just a lot of sadistic violence and an \\"apocalypse\\" payoff that comes from what, what?   The doppelganger stuff doesn't work.  There is no motivation.  Boredom does not count.  The notion that somehow bringing down New York \\"frees\\" debt slaves is stupid.  Computers in Podunk have the information. <br /> <br />All in all, unless you are a very angry person stuck in a terrible and pathetic adolescence, this is not a decent movie.  Too bad.  I could see places where it might have worked. <br /> <br />If you like this movie, you'll love \\"Triumph of the Will.\\"  Just get real with your inner self. <br /> <br />Sorry!
B0000019PA|5.0|I've been listening to this CD for over 5 years now and find myself coming back to it every few months.  It's an album that grows on you and changes you and changes with you, one of those things where if you get it, you live it and it never goes away.  You'll listen to this as you grow and change and it'll always affect you.   You'll get the urge, the NEED to present this to people, to wish they'll experience it and see what you see, and be severly disappointed when they don't like it and will never understand why not.      Is that not the criteria for an album that needs to be placed up there along with all those Beatles and Zeppelin and Dylan and Nick Drake records?     I bought a copy of this CD for close friend of mine and he liked it but didn't find it amazing.  A year later he experienced a severe loss in his family.  He later thanked me for my support and for giving him a copy of this CD, as he found himself turning to it and it helped him get through his loss.     Is this not the criteria for an album so important and so great and so universally personal that is should be required in every person's home?      If not, I will never ever comprehend why not.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|The album is underwhelming compared to Toxicity or even Steal this Album. It only has 3 good tracks. Most of it seems like a practical joke.  <br /> <br />B.Y.O.B. is worth owning so if you're the fiscal type you should buy the track from itunes
B0007OCG4W|1.0|This movie plays like a bad parody of an Ingmar Bergman film.  People fall in desperate love after five minutes of inane conversation.  Jude Law is terrific in his first scenes as an obituary writer who gets a crush on Natalie Portman's character after an auto/pedestrian accident.  But the next time we see him, he seems to be playing someone else entirely.  Julia Roberts is flat as the photographer who falls for Jude-the- jerk.  Portman is serviceable as the waif who drifts through the lives of the other three.  As many have noted, Clive Owen steals the movie.  He brings badly-needed energy and edginess to every scene.  I really can't imagine anyone caring what happens to these four sad sacks (except, possibly, Owen).  This is one of those films that critics love, and the people who have to pay for their tickets loathe.  And I still have no idea what the title means.  If this is \\"Closer,\\" then I'll be happy to keep my distance.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Like i said before the legendary singer Mariah delievers again with this album and already has two number one hits!!!!! In my book Mariah will always be number one and her songs are touching and great to dance or just relax to!!!!!! KEEP UP THE GREAT WORK MARIAH!!!!!
B00009V7PJ|5.0|Bought it recently and regret having not bought it sooner. Cher brings out the best in everyone, whether she sings or speaks onstage. I like her stage presence and her outlook on life. True, she is not going to tour anymore, but she will have left a great impact on young women in the music industry of the future (hopefully). It's hard to believe Cher has been a Diva for 40 years. She's got the body & soul of a 20-year-old, and I hope she won't go off the screen for good! She should continue acting, as I don't think the world will ever see enough of Cher.<br /><br />I missed both Montreal performances from this Tour, thinking it would be an utter waste of money. I was proven very wrong!<br /><br />Okay...regarding the DVD itself, here are some comments:<br /><br />Positive:<br />- The Sound is amazing<br />- The Costumes and Set Designs are much more stunning<br />- The \\"If I could turn back time\\" performance blew me away! (she looks the same as in the 80's!)<br />- Cher's dialogue on stage is really witty & entertaining<br />- Her voice never gave out during the show<br />- \\"Believe\\" was performed far better this time than on the \\"Believe Tour\\" DVD<br />- I appreciate the extras and the interviews & backstage stuff (we learn more about Cher that way)<br />- the costume changes (all 7 of them) were pretty quick!<br /><br />Negative:<br />- Should've been a 2 disc set with Bonus Features on disc 2<br />- The bonus songs in the \\"Bonus Features\\" should've been in the  show's tracklist<br />- Cher didn't talk as much during this show, compared to the \\"Believe\\" tour DVD<br /><br />TRACKLIST:<br />01- Opening<br />02- I Still Haven't Found What I'm Looking For<br />03- Song For The Lonely<br />04- Gayatri Mantra<br />05- All Or Nothing<br />06- I Found Someone<br />07- Bang Bang<br />08- Sonny & Cher Medley (The Beat Goes On/Baby Don't Go/I Got You Babe)<br />09- All I Really Want To Do (Medley Part 1)<br />10- Half Breed (Medley Part 2)<br />11- Gypsies, Tramps And Thieves (Medley Part 3)<br />12- Dark Lady (Medley Part 4)<br />13- Take Me Home<br />14- The Way Of Love<br />15- After All<br />16- Just Like Jesse James<br />17- Heart Of Stone<br />18- The Shoop Shoop Song<br />19- Strong Enough<br />20- If I Could Turn Back Time<br />21- Believe<br />22- End Credits<br /><br />BONUS FEATURES:<br />- 3 Extra Live Songs From The Same Concert: (Save Up All Your Tears/ We All Sleep Alone/ A Different Kind of Love Song)<br />- Music Video for \\"If I could Turn Back Time\\" 2003 Re-Edit<br />- Cher's special version of \\"West Side Story\\"<br />- Behind the scenes Documentary & Interviews<br />- Extra Cher Monologues<br />- Costume Designs<br /><br />Total Running Time: 92 Minutes<br /><br />I love the packaging. It's more compact and is very colorful. Cher is all about fun, and what she's given us is pure fun fun FUN! I've never imagined the DVD being as great as it is. So, i was very mistaken when I popped it into my mom's new DVD player. It blew us away! Cher belts out every song with power, grace and devotion to her career.<br /><br />Imagine doing 7 costume changes during a concert, looking even better with each one! It's amazing and very clever!

0385338686|5.0|This book was great reading all the way through.  I could not put the book down.  I felt that the book was all about life's choices and the values we place on what is important to us.  This was my first Kinsella novel and now I want to read her other books.  I highly recommend it!
B0007GAERG|4.0|I was never really interested much in Mariah Carey until I heard We belong together on the radio, and I decieded to get her new album. I definately got my money's worth. There are some fillers, but mainly it's something worth listening to.
B000002L9M|5.0|This album is divinely inspired. <br /> <br />I'd probably only rate one of the songs on Black Celebration among my top 10 Depeche Mode tracks of all time (Fly On The Windscreen), but this album stands head and shoulders above the rest. <br /> <br />This is like the game Gretzky scored 18 goals in one game, or the time each of the songs in the Top 40 were by the Beatles, or that painting by Picasso that's so beautiful it makes your eyes bleed, or the time Pele won the World Cup all by himself...  A mind-blowing performance, by one of the best ever.
B0000DBJDM|2.0|This DVD was not shot with the best interest of the band in mind. Most of the interviews did not really get to the meaning behind the group. The whole DVD was sloppy. Added to that, the DVD skipped many times during play.
B0007OCG4W|1.0|I have been a great fan of the director Mike Nichols right from his first film. However, in this movie, I have to draw the line. Firstly, I am glad that I rented the movie and did not see it on theatre. It shows the life of 4 people who are drawn in different directions. Granted that life is never straight, but I never thought that it was this distraught. Maybe I was wrong. It has a big cast, Jude Law, Natalie Portman, Clive Owens and Julia Roberts. I for one think that Julia Roberts and Jude Law were totally wrong for the movie and were reciting their lines. In fact, I think that Jude Law is way overrated. I cannot think of a single movie where he was spectacular. After this movie, he should retire. Natalie Portman was not bad, but Clive Owens was the only one showing real human emotions. The movie is replete with bad language, adultery and lying to each other without any obvious reason. While Patrick Marber's stage play was terrific, the movie was terrible. If the director wanted to bring out the irony behind love, he did a shoddy job of it. I will not go into the story, there are enough reviewers who have done so. Life is bad enough as it is, without a movie taking all the ironies to the extreme and portraying it in a dull, stupid way. All I can say after this movie is that, I am glad that I am not into internet chat rooms and my respect for some actors and the director have gone down tremendously. Please avoid at all cost.
B000024D4R|5.0|Who is this kid from \\"a kid's review\\"? I've read several reviews from him and they're all horribly negative. This kid has no intelligence, no taste and no appreciation for classic rock. It seems that he also has nothing better to do than to go on Amazon.com and bash anything he doesn't understand. Doesn't this kid have any kind of social life? After school activity? Girlfriend??? He seems very angry at the world and personally I'm tired of coming on here and reading all of his negativity. I think it is innappropriate for Amazon to keep allowing him to submit and them to print his reviews. Is this kid like 6 yrs. old or something? Hopefully other people recognize the immaturaty in his writing and not pay any attention to it.
B000021YQV|5.0|This is System Of A Down's second album and this is probably their most sucessful album to date. The reason why it was such a great album is that because the songs are well written and even if your not a nu-metal fan some of the songs any music fan can enjoy. Toxicity had some big hits like \\"Chop Suey,\\" \\"Toxicity,\\" and \\"Aerials.\\" Some other favorites was \\"Prison Song\\" and \\"Needles.\\" Their first album, System of a Down, was a good album but the songs on there weren't as well written or organized as this album or any other System of a Down album that follows. So all together this album rocks and System of a Down is one of the best metal bands on the market. Buy this album if you don't have it (and buy any other album that they have...now!) <br /> <br />1. Prison Song - 10/10 My personal favorite <br />2. Needles - 10/10 <br />3. Deer Dance - 8/10 <br />4. Jet Pilot - 7/10 <br />5. X - 9/10 <br />6. Chop Suey - 10/10 <br />7. Bounce - 7/10 <br />8. Forest - 8/10 <br />9. ATWA - 8/10 <br />10. Science - 9/10 <br />11. Shimmy - 10/10 <br />12. Toxicity - 10/10 <br />13. Psycho - 9/10 Psycho, groupie, cocaine, crazy <br />14. Aerials - 10/10 <br />15. Arto - 7/10

B000000OAC|5.0|yes, another wonderful, thoughtful musica album from queen, \\"rock you\\" is wonderful and \\"champions\\" is thoughtful. other musica worth hearing on this album is all of them. remember, if you don't own this wonderful, thoughtful album, \\"it's late\\" but not to late to pick this baby up.
B000A5044C|4.0|It is difficult to watch this film knowing that some children in this world will have to endure neglect of this capacity (or any other for that matter).  <br /> <br />Roughly, the story centers on a quartet of siblings who are more or less stranded in a city apartment. At first the struggle can be humorous, however those moments become few and far between as the kids drain through the cash they have and must resort to scraping by any means necessary, barely making the \\"rent\\". Throughout the film the family \\"hides\\" themselves from the public view and tries to bond with  the few outside people they come across, which are other children of similar age. <br /> <br />The one reason that makes this film so great is it truly balances the good and bad events that make the experience all the more real. It never sugar coats the terrible portions, but despite how low times go for the children it depicts their spirit of survival. It is brilliant to witness how minimal/basic they have paired their lives down while existing in the gluttony of civilization.  The Boy playing the eldest child (Akira) does a marvelous performance (which he won an award for) trying to keep the clan together and not fall into despair himself. The remaining cast are very good as well, turning out a believable story.  <br /> <br />If you come across it, definitely see the it. However uncomfortable it may prove, you'll be glad you did.
B000000OA6|5.0|yes, queen's last album in freddie's lifetime is a truly wonderful and thoughtful album. no more \\"white or black queen's,\\" but we do have entertainment. AS queen embark on a new tour with \\"paul rodgers\\" they prove the show will go on, after all, why wouldn't this iconic, wonderful, thoughtful band try to rule the music world once again, \\"these are the day's of their lives,\\" so they should make the best of the queen legacy, they were and are to wonderful and thoughtful, and make to much good musica to lay down. true, their only working with \\"three wheels these days,\\" but to not continue this great legacy, they would have to be \\"slightly mad,\\" even without the best frontman of all time, even freddie stated \\"the show must go on.\\"
B0002Z1EG2|5.0|Shania Twain is classified \\"Country\\" in most ways.  Her newer music really isn't country to me, however.  I love both her old and new music, however different the two may be.  This album is wonderful. <br /> <br />Forever and For Always- I like this song, but it's a bit cheesy.  It's kind of overdone, but it is nice and pretty. 8/10 <br /> <br />I'm Gonna Getcha Good!- This is a cute song, with powerful lyrics and a fun tune. 9/10 <br /> <br />Up!- The lyrics to this song are less than great, but the tune is fun to dance to, and it's an all around good song. 8/10 <br /> <br />Come On Over- I'm not sure why this song was made a single.  It's not that great.  The words are forced and the tune is just boring. 6/10 <br /> <br />Man!  I Feel Like a Woman!- Everyone knows and loves this song.  It's a feel- good, girl- power anthem, and I love it! 10/10 <br /> <br />That Don't Impress Me Much- This song is great.  It's definitely one of the best Shania songs of all time.  The lyrics may be a little off, but it's still a good song. 10/10 <br /> <br />From This Moment On- This is a great ballad about everlasting love.  It has a great message, and the tune is lovely. 10/10 <br /> <br />Honey I'm Home- A lot of people don't like this song, but I think it's cute.  It really has no meaning, but it's a fun song. 9/10 <br /> <br />You're Still the One- This, in my opinion, is the best Shania song of all time.  It's very simple and relaxed, but it's a great song. 10/10 <br /> <br />Don't Be Stupid(You Know I Love You)- This is a good song about putting trust in your significant other.  It has cool strings. 9/10 <br /> <br />Love Gets Me Every Time- This is another great Shania song.  It's irresistable and fun. 10/10 <br /> <br />No One Needs To Know- I loved this song at first listen.  The tune is simple, and kind of repetative, but it's an addictive song. 10/10 <br /> <br />You Win My Love- I haven't really listened to this song that much, but it's okay. 8/10 <br /> <br />(If You're Not In It For Love) I'm Outta Here!- This is one of my favorite songs on the CD.  It's strong and to- the- point.  10/10 <br /> <br />The Woman In Me(Needs the Man in You)- Meh.  It's okay.  Too slow for my tastes, a little. 7/10 <br /> <br />Any Man of Mine- This is a good song, about how your man had better treat you right.  I like it, especially the tune. 9/10 <br /> <br />Whose Bed Have Your Boots Been Under?- This is a fun song to get up and dance to.  It has good lyrics. 9/10 <br /> <br />Party For Two(With Mark McGrath)- I love this song, but I don't like this version.  It's too poppy. 7/10 <br /> <br />Don't!- I really don't see what's so great about this song.  It's sort of repetative, and the lyrics aren't all that great. 6/10 <br /> <br />Party For Two(With Billy Currington)- This is a cute song about...well...a party for two!  It has flirty lyrics, and a great tune. 10/10 <br /> <br />I Ain't No Quitter- This song is pointless and horrible.  I don't like it at all. 4/10
B000000OAA|5.0|yes, another wonderful, thoughtful musica album from the rock icons queen. \\"killer queen\\" is wonderful. \\"stone cold crazy\\" is thoughtful, and \\"now i'm here\\" is another queen classic. this is a wonderful, thoughtful album to listen to. \\"BRIGHTON ROCKS YOU\\".

B00080ZG10|4.0|In The Aviator, Leonardo DiCaprio portrays the young Howard Hughes, one of America's first billionaires. Hughes inherited a huge fortune from his family's tool and dye company and decided to use the money to push the world forward. He was a prominent director, who pushed the limits of violence and promiscuity in film, and he was a constant innovator of aviation technologies. As the owner of TWA, he took on corrupt senators to prevent Pan-Am from having a sole monopoly on transatlantic flights. Yet, despite these accomplishments, Hughes had undiagnosed Obsessive-Compulsive Disorder that led him to fall into madness as he always feared that germs and sickness loomed around every corner. <br /> <br />In the movie, DiCaprio portrays Hughes perfectly since he is able to play the cocky, Hollywood playboy that Hughes was, and at the same time, he conveys to the audience that Hughes is not stable and falling deeper into insanity. One actor that really annoyed me though was Cate Blanchett's portrayal of Kate Hepburn. Her voice is whiny, her accent pierces the ears, and it makes Hepburn seem like an annoying and overzealous women. <br /> <br />One place where the DVD adds to the movie is the special features which include a short documentary about OCD and its effects. In this feature, they even interview some real life patients to show that the portrayal of Hughes's disease was not too farfetched. Another aspect that I enjoyed was the History Channel documentary on Hughes that adds some new historical information to the film. <br /> <br />All together, I think this is one of the better movies that have come out in a long time, and despite the length of the movie (170 Minutes), I found the plot intriguing enough that time seemed to fly away. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000000OAH|5.0|queen was always a great band, and put out wonderful, thoughtful musica. \\"jazz\\" is one of those wonderful, thoughtful musica albums, they will \\"entertain you\\" throughout this wonderful, thoughtful musica album. Fat bottomed girls will love this album, cos they make this wonderful, thoughtful world go round.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|I have bought 2 DVDs of this movie in the pass. So far, they were all pieces of junk & not worth owning. I understand that this version is by Paramount Studios. Hopefully this will be the one that presents this great movie in the format it deserves.
B0009FU0ZQ|3.0|There's a lot done right in this movie. It's a cat-and-mouse murder mystery, a little romantic, and high on the \\"good father\\" scale, at least in the sense of being properly fatherly. It's also a Tom Selleck movie. Selleck is no longer a young stud - neither particularly young, nor particularly studly. That describes lots of perfectly good people. Selleck plays a character that matches his appearance, and still gets some romantic interest anyway.<br /><br />The plot is straightforward. There are two crimes, the first a murder that becomes a series of murders. The other is the gang-rape of a teenage girl. This is a low-brain-power movie, so both crimes are solved and the criminals brought to justice, or something like it. I won't give any spoilers, but I wish the rape were resolved a bit more forcefully. Selleck's character is good, or good enough. The problem is in the script. But this is a popcorn movie, not the place for heavy topics, and not a vehicle for wild heroics. And the bad guys don't always get the bad they deserve in real life, either.<br /><br />It's good, lightweight entertainment. If you want to kill an evening, this should so the job - or at least leave it comatose.<br /><br />//wiredweird
B0006IIPIK|3.0|I eagerly anticipated Kerry Conran's \\"Sky Captain and the World of Tomorrow,\\" ever since I saw the previews in the theater.  Who wouldn't love a rollicking yarn set in the glorious adventure hey-days of pre-WWII?  With intrepid heroes with intrepid names like Joseph \\"Sky Captain\\" Sullivan (Jude Law) and Polly Perkins (Gwyneth Paltrow) engaging in derring-do against a dastardly villain and his titanic robotic minions, what could possibly go wrong? <br /> <br />Suffice it to say that for the first ten minutes of \\"Sky Captain\\" I was enchanted.  A glorious scene where the Hindenburg III flies through a snow-storm to dock atop the Empire State Building, with various and sundry characters looking gravely concerned and on the verge of panic sets the stage for both grandeur and a suitably sinister plot.   <br /> <br />What a let-down!  The movie quickly devolves into a murky plot involving some kind of invasion and some kind of plot involving super-secret scientists.  And the performances by this normally-stellar cast are uniformly wooden (with Angelina Jolie the lone exception as the delectable, one-eyed Commander Franky Cook) -- it's almost like George Lucas was in charge.  For actors such as Law, Paltrow, and Giovanni Ribisi to have so many flat, empty scenes is just shocking.  This is a movie where gigantic robots invade New York City, for Pete's sake, and yet in most scenes the actors deliver lines in sotto voce, a soft deadpan that is completely at odds with what is happening around them.  Why bring in the radiant Jude Law and make him act like a young John Gielgud? <br /> <br />The plot of \\"Sky Captain\\" also has a lumpy, amorphous feeling to it.  Despite a wonderful set-up, we are denied much of an explanation of what is going on, and the \\"unique condition\\" of the villain denies us any climactic confrontations between good and evil.  For a movie that deals in such broad characterizations, this is a surprising twist that doesn't work.  Also, the villain has one interesting henchman - an acrobatic female assassin -- who ultimately fails to deliver on her awesomely diabolical potential.  She is no Darth Maul! <br /> <br />All in all, Kerry Conran and team have made a landmark film with \\"Sky Captain,\\" but only on the technical side.  The movie is easily one of the best-looking films I've ever seen, and there are several scenes of considerable imagination and craft.  And yet Conran's bunch was unsuccessful in uniting their amazing vision with the human craft of acting.  The movie feels disjointed, and you can almost picture the actors performing in front of a blue-screen against imaginary backdrops that will be added in later by CGI.  Disbelief cannot be suspended, and as a result, the movie fails. <br /> <br />Worth a rental, \\"Sky Captain\\" is not essential for any movie library except for its technical expertise.  Here's hoping that Conran and team get another shot at using their amazing technology to tell a great story. <br /> <br />
0679446230|5.0|I was first exposed to this book in college for a cultural anthropology class.  I loved it.  I have reread this several times over the years and in each case, the novel continues to stand up to my own personal scrutiny.  Achebe's portrayal of Nigeria at the time of European colonial expansion was excellent.  His portrayal of a man who projects strength and toughness to those around him but is ultimately ruled by his own fear is first rate as well.  There are some disturbing scenes in the book (spousal/child abuse & the murder of a child come to mind) so there is a certain maturity level required of the reader.  I wouldn't hesitate to recommend this book to anyone who wants something that will promote thought long after they finish the book.
B000002IG4|5.0|In 1982, after the success of his first solo album entitled, FACE VALUE, Phil Collins released his second solo album entitled, HELLO, I MUST BE GOING! This album serves as much of a reputation to Phil Collins as his first album had done. This album is sort of a reflection on the divorce he had gone through with his first wife, Jill. Those songs will be mentioned in my review. <br /> <br />I DON'T CARE ANYMORE <br />  This song was released as a single, but, DAMN IT!, it was not a big hit. This song is just outstanding, I can't help, but love the drum beat. This would be the first song about his ex-wife. <br /> <br />I CANNOT BELIEVE IT'S TRUE <br />  Well, when you have gone through a divorce from your wife or husband, did you even expect to believe that was going to happen? I didn't think so. I know for a fact that if I had married and had gone through with a divorce, I sure as hell wouldn't have believed it myself. What I like is that instead of making the song sound bitter, he made it a fun and uptemp tune. <br /> <br />LIKE CHINA <br />  Another great song. <br /> <br />DO YOU KNOW, DO YOU CARE? <br />  This is the third song about his divorce to his ex-wife. Whoa, not like \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\". I mean, the song, \\"I Cannot Believe It's True\\", was the second song on this album about his divorce, but he made that one sound nice and cheery, while this song, just like \\"I Don't Care Anymore\\", only a step below, was made very bitter. <br /> <br />YOU CAN'T HURRY LOVE <br />  That's right; \\"You Can't Hurry Love\\". It has to come on it's own. This song, you know, was originally recorded by the infamous Diana Ross & The Surpremes, only Phil Collins made this song worth listening to, while The Surpremes didn't. The Surpremes only had three hits that I had liked and they are: \\"Stop! In The Name Of Love\\", \\"Baby Love\\", & \\"Where Did Our Love Go\\". <br /> <br />IT DON'T MATTER TO ME <br />  The fourth & final song about Phil's divorce. It's funny how this album includes four songs about his divorce where two of them are funfilled and cheery, whilst the other two being very bitter and angry. <br /> <br />THRU THESE WALLS <br />  This is another one of Phil's beautiful ballads. He always had great uptempo songs, but he always had a way with recording great ballads like this, whether the are smooth relaxing ballads like this or the usual power ballads, like \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\". <br /> <br />DON'T LET HIM STEAL YOUR HEART AWAY <br />  There is something about this song that sort of sounds a little bit (and I mean a little bit by maybe 3% to 5% of the song) like \\"Against All Odds (Take A Look At Me Now)\\". I know that sounds a little awkward, since that song was not recorded until three years after this album was released, but this song sounds like a little prelude. <br /> <br />THE WEST SIDE <br />  A great song with great Sax arrangements. <br /> <br />WHY CAN'T IT WAIT TILL MORNING <br />  This is another beautiful song. <br /> <br />     I have thorougly enjoyed this album. I cannot help myself, but to say that this is one of my favorite Phil Collins' albums and it can be your favorite as well. So buying this album would be one of the best choices you ever made.
B000286RNY|4.0|The movie reminds me of silly Japanese comics I had read as a child in Japan. I find it interesting to see the combination of special effect and silly story that were usually seen only in animation or comics. I want to warn you that the silliness is intense. This movie can be described as a STUPID movie, but since it is entertaining. I wonder if the movie was intended to children as its content is very silly to me.
B00004Z459|1.0|I can't believe the public and radio stations alike are so unbelievably gullible!  Here we have Linkin Park taking the very, VERY basic elements of metal, rap, and song writing and creating an even more basic end-product they call music. I am amazed that LP is considered as metal by some listeners.  Just as a clue, a few power riffs + screaming != metal. In fact, it is a disgrace to use the word 'metal' to describe LP and their music.  <br /> <br />I will actually go out on a limb and say LP produces some good beats, but so does my #2 pencil on a desk. Beats are not enough to save LP from the abyss known as mediocrity. Their guitarist is merely 'OK' and their drummer can smack some snares and cymbals sufficiently. But then again, I have seen dogs skateboard and squirrels water ski, so the fact that these two humans can produce basic sounds on guitars and drum sets does not say a whole lot. <br /> <br />Their lyricists are by far the weakest links of the entire band. I don't even know where to begin with these two clowns. You have one who was clearly beaten up all throughout K-12 and perhaps into college (which I doubt he attended based on the kiddy-like lyrics). This guy goes on and on and on about his feelings, his pain, his...c'mon guy, go lift some weights and eat some protein and get over yourself. He can scream pretty well, I will give him that, but that is about the only thing he does not suck at. The only thing I can imagine is that LP is trying to appeal to pre-pubescent teenagers with their lyrics about feelings and emotions.  Economists say teenagers spend billions of dollars on useless crap every year, so why not try to take advantage of this?  LP shows that anyone can make it with the right marketing and ad campaign. <br /> <br />His partner in crime, MC Burrito, would do much better on an episode of Blues Clues or Barney. His overly simplified raps make even a three year old say \\"What in God's name is going on here?!\\"  Maybe this guy has problems with words containing more than two syllables or he never made it past the sixth grade, but he needs to step it up and create some more complex lines. <br /> <br />Overall, LP does one thing well - produce bad music. It is a shame to see such a band become so popular when they are one of the worst bands on the planet and perhaps in the history of mankind. Is it a commentary about how complacent our society is today with respect to music?  Or perhaps it has more to do with the power of mass marketing and MTV?  Or maybe a little bit of both?  I will leave that decision to you.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|<br /> <br />\\"X2: X-men united\\" was a rockin' movie! It was so good! I've watched and read everything I possibly could on X-men in my youth and I must say the movies live up to my expetations of it lots of action and fighting! With some politics and slight romance. However, some of the scenes [two to be exact] have sexual content that borderlines the PG-13 rating \\"almost\\" but it doesn't go overboard [thanfully]. be sure to think twice before letting a younger child see this or just cover his/her eyes with your hands. The fights are outstanding, they really get your blood flowing and send shivers down your spine! The battle between Wolverine and Lady Deathstrike was too cool, and there is one scene that might remind some of DBZ [Dragon ball Z], but I'm not telling. The plot is also exceptional much like its predecessor. \\"After a devastating attempt on the President's life, and the revelation that a mutant was involved, public pressure to ratify the Mutant Registration Act increases, an act which would force all mutants in the nation to publicly declare themselves mutants and dictate the nature of all of their powers to the federal government.  <br /> <br />\\"An attack on Professor Xavier's School for the Gifted (labeled a Mutant training facility by the media), leads to an unlikely alliance with the recently escaped Magneto in a frantic race to stop William Stryker, a military leader with a hatred of mutants, before he can succeed in his plan to destroy all mutants.Stryker has orchestrated the attack on the President to get official approval for his attack on all mutants.  <br /> <br /> <br />He is able to control mutants with a powerful drug, and gains control over Professor Xavier through Jason, one of the professor's former students, who is able to project powerful visions in the mind, blinding a person to reality. Stryker has created a copy of Professor Xavier's machine Cerebro which, we learn, was invented by then-friends Professor Xavier and Magneto. In the process, Wolverine learns some of his forgotten past and how his body was enhanced with a superstrong adamantium skeleton.\\" The only problems I had was that they still did not give Storm much to do in this movie \\"physical-wise\\" (but then again, she doesn't phys.ED much in the comics. I guess weather control has its perks). If you loved \\"X-men\\" then, you'll probably love the sequel just as much.  [a 5 out of 5]
0805211063|4.0|Judging from the commentaries on here, this is a book one either \\"gets\\" or \\"doesn't get\\"... I'm startled that several reviewers didn't consider K an interesting character; I always thought he was the best of Kafka's alter-egos--vain, short-tempered, tirelessly calculating, yet endearingly scrappy.<br />It is important to stress that this novel was put together posthumously from Kafka's chaotic notes, and that there were numerous unresolved plot threads that had to be sorted through; thus the book in it's present state is essentially just an editor's \\"best guess\\" at what decisions Kafka might've made if he had finished it himself. In Max Brod's version, an appendix was included with the alternate possibilities that Kafka had written at various points in the narrative. This was a wise decision-- it essentially preserved the work as the author had left it, and it also added to the amorphous, disoriented feeling of the book. Reading that version while referring to the appendix is much like accompanying Kafka through the labyrinthine process of creating his unwieldy epic.<br />Part of the charm of Kafka is in the sincere amateurishness of his work. He seems bored by the mechanics of constructing a tidy, coherent plot; he easily gets sidetracked and lost in his own wildly inspired creations. He abandons his work in the way a bewildered child will abruptly walk away from an unresolved, too-ambitious crayon masterpiece. In this version, although the translator went to great pains to preserve the feeling of Kafka's language, he unfortunately left out these important notes, thus turning this strange, unique book into a more conventional novel.
B00005JKC3|3.0|<br /> <br />I saw the hulk in the theaters, after watching \\"Hollywood Homicide\\" (Horrible movie. No plot whatsoever), in hopes that it would wash the b-\\"bad\\"-movie from my mind. But that's besides the point. Ang Lee's \\"The Hulk\\" is a pointless movie all to begin with. It feels more like a sleepy-time drama full would-be-angst, silly flashbacks. Coupled with cold and heartless acting, it gives you feeling of a OVERHYPED foreign (and non-foreign) movies on the Independence Channel. But the overall action made it watchable.  <br /> <br /> <br />On the plus side there's one humorous scene in the movie, concerning Bruce Banner (Erica Bana --- see a resemblance in the names?) so called \\"love-rival\\" named \\"Talbot\\" played by Josh Lucas (for Jennifer Connely's character \\"Betty Ross\\" daughter of Major Ross - Sam Elliott) when he tries to kill the recently transformed Hulk-Banner with a missile launcher but it backfires on him . . . literally AND he get's flambed. I laughed so hard at that scene.  <br /> <br /> <br />Now, I've read the Hulk comic books (granted they were angsty at times, but full as well as entertaining), they had more a plot than this movie that does no justice to Stan Lee's comic. It felt like the movie tried to hard to give the Hulk's character some type of depth concerning his past as child, his father Brian Banner (Nick Nolte) and his would be chemistry between his former girlfriend Betty Ross after they broke up if I remember correctly. It wasn't a bad movie, it just felt like it tired to hard to be serious and action film based around the incredible Hulk. The CGI for the Hulk was great, the long camera shots of deserts were beautiful, and the cooky \\"24\\" type comic-strip views were all right but they did get annoying at times (at least thee tried to give it a comic-book feel). Rent or buy this movie if you like the Hulk but don't expect too much. [a 3 out of 5]

B000067FP7|5.0|For Christmas, Billy Peltzer's father gives him a cute, furry creature known as a Mogwai that he bought in Chinatown. Billy is warned that he must follow three rules with the Mogwai, whom he names Gizmo: 1) keep him out of light, especially sunlight; 2) don't get him wet; and 3) never feed him after midnight. It doesn't take long before the rules are broken and disaster ensues: the Gremlins multiply and none of them are as cute and lovable as Gizmo. The Gremlins cause much destruction and mayhem in Billy's quiet little town and he and his girlfriend, Kate, rush to stop them before the town is totally destroyed.<br /><br />Gremlins is a great movie that has a bit of everything: humor, horror, parody and even romance. Billy's town is straight out of \\"It's A wonderful Life\\" and the rich and not so nice Mrs. Deagle is a modern day Miss Gulch from The Wizard of Oz. Outside of some scene's in the Peltzer's kitchen and what happens to Mrs. Deagle, the Gremlins are more mischievous than deadly. However, the kitchen scenes are a bit gruesome and not suitable for younger viewers. Most of the film is darkly comic, if a bit violent, especially the bar scene, the scene where the Gremlins call caroling at Mrs. Deagle's house, and the movie theater scene, as well as the final climax. The one scene that feels out of place to me is when Kate describes why she hates Christmas.  I've seen the movie many times and still wonder why that scene was left in.<br /><br />The acting is quite good in this movie. Zach Galligan and Phoebe Cates have a nice chemistry together and make a sweet couple. Frances Lee McCain is excellent as Billy's terrorized mother and Hoyt Axton does a great job as Billy's lovable but inept inventor father (some of the funniest scenes in the movie revolve around his inventions). Dick Miller is good as Billy's paranoid neighbor, and Polly Holiday chews up the scenery as the cruel Mrs. Deagle. Judge Reinhold shows up briefly as a potential love rival for Kate and then disappears from the movie, as does Corey Feldman as Billy's young neighbor.<br /><br />This movie isn't for everyone's taste. I saw the movie with a friend who hated it saying she didn't see anything funny about people being killed at Christmas. Personally, I thought it was wickedly funny and recommend it to fans of darkly comic horror movies.then disappears from the movie, as does Corey Feldman as Billy's young neighbor. <br /> <br />This movie isn't for everyone's taste.

0143034901|3.0|This was a good read and I enjoyed it, but I did not think the quality was as fabulous as many others did.  Some of the character development was superb (you will love Fermin), but others were very black and white, bordering on caricature.  Good people were sooo good and bad people were sooo bad.  The cemetery of books was a marvelous concept and you will enjoy its role in the book.  Fun guessing how it will all work out.  Some of the plot seems a little contrived.  For instance, why Clara?  What role did she serve?  All the characters get tied up with pretty bows at the end, which may irritate some and may give others good closure.  It is an excellent translation.
B000819PKC|5.0|Jamiroquai has done it again with their sixth full release of \\"acid jazz\\"/club grooves!  \\"Dynamite\\" is a return to form after a disappointing \\"Funk Odyssey\\"--at least to me anyway-- although, its record sells will tell otherwise!  But then, this group never really puts out a bad CD.  That being said, Jamiroquai front man Jay Kay still belts out tell-it-like-it-is lyrics with that rich Stevie Wonderness that I dig so much ('cept I like Jay Kay's style 100xs better than Stevie's!).  The boys in the band bring 70s influenced beats and edgey dance floor grooves as usual with live instruments and tight productions.  Standout tracks include Talullah, Feels Just Like It Should, Dynamite, Electric Mistress, Don't Give Hate a Chance and Seven Days.  Another instanst classic from the boys in the U.K. that's--to steal the hook from that popular '70s sitcom--DY-NO-MITE!!!!!!!!!
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|Every single track on this CD is good, not something you usually find on an album.  This is a good album to turn up loud.  It's not just dischord screaming like a lot of other CDs, it's really musical and good.  This is one of the best metal CDs I own and I highly recommend it.
B0001Z52RU|5.0|It's been awhile since I've seen this movie but I felt it necessary to give it proper credit.  The boy has unconscious spells as a child which are later explained in the movie.   <br />Kudos to the imagination acquired to create such a time-travel movie.   <br /> <br />The best sci-fi movies are the ones that are right on the edge of reality.  They make you wonder long after you watch it whether the story could actually happen.
0790742780|5.0|This film has had more controversy surround it than most, but let me tell you, it's one kick-ass piece of work. Like Richard Burton's reverend in NIGHT OF THE IGUANA, who goes over the edge during a Sunday sermon, Douglas, as the victim of downsizing, makes that same trip while stuck in a traffic jam on an L. A. freeway during a summer heat spell. (I live in the Los Angeles area, and though I have never lost my job to downsizing, I still have total empathy for the character's breaking point every time I get stuck in similar traffic snarls!) Once he gets out of his car, leaving it abandoned in the middle of the traffic jam, and starts his march through the city to go home to his ex-wife and child, we know nothing positive is going to come. The trip is alternatively funny and tragic, thanks to Douglas's performance. He somehow manages to walk the very thin line between his character's Archie Bunker-isms and his character's horrible situation as he cuts a violent path to the ocean. There are some truly hard-to-watch moments in this film (the war surplus store sequence is particularly brutal), but one can't shy away from the out-of-control anger of this poor man, who can't understand why he's suffered his fate of unemployment after playing by all of the rules. Economic forces continue to leave many in similar circumstances, but Douglas starts connecting the dots to things that have nothing to do with his plight: a Korean mini-mart owner who marks up everything, including a can of soda; fast-food service providers who play by their policies with arrogance, etc. The tragic humor in the Douglas character is that he sees himself as the  victim of all these forces and of the inner-city dry rot that he encounters on his journey. (Thankfully, most people shelve their victimhood and move on with their lives, often landing squarely and positively on both feet.) This film is great because it provokes reactions in the viewer, often creating a sense of discomfort. Not easily forgotten, FALLING DOWN should be enjoyed as the masterpiece it ultimately is.     <br /> <br /> <br />

B00025ETIW|5.0|This band's first impression to me was horrible. I thought they just screamed too much. In the \\"I'm Not Okay\\" music video, I often joked about how the singer's eyes bulged out a lot. And I didn't really like how it seemed almost repetitive. All I heard was ,\\" I'M NOT OKAY!\\" many times. Now, when I took this music seriously, I was into it. Sooner or later, I found myself listening to MCR every time I turned something on. I totally changed my view of this band. Honestly speaking, My Chemical Romance has unique talents that even I did not realize until now. Gerard's voice is unique compared to other singers. No one can probably scream like this guy. When he screams, he has two emotions : something in pain and then something sweet. I love it.  <br /> <br />Now, the band got to be the most tightest assembled group ever. I love every single one of them, especially the 2nd guitarist. His solo riffs rip into the song like a 70s Jimi Hendrix- kinda... Can't really explain it.  <br /> <br />Now, emo bands tend to have the easiest songs ever when it comes to guitar. Green Day is a joke, etc. Even metal bands such as System of a Down (My favorite band) has easy riffs and catchups. Now, you can say that My Chemical Romance is pretty easy to play, NOT. You know how long I've played \\"I'm Not Okay?\\" and couldn't get that solo part down to the beat? I can play along, but that extremely fast paced part in the end of the solo is impossible for me. Could be different for others, but I found it pretty hard. ANYWAYS, let's get back to the review..... <br /> <br />I've listened to Helena, which was almost like a ballad. It had a fast pace, and then a slow, melodic tune that I can hear in my head. Best song alive though is ,\\" Thank You For the Venom.\\" I listen to the song and wonder how the hell the guitarists play like that. The intro comes in with a fast pace tone, and then introduces us to the (again) fast paced song. It leaves me in awe into wondering how well-balanced the two guitarists are keeping the beat together. They match the sound together so perfectly. As you listen to the awesome fingering part of the song, the other guitarist would launch a powerful tone into each accents, producing a threatening sound that scared me when I listened to the song loudly.  <br />Overall, this is definitely a great band. Compared to all the other \\"emo-punk\\" bands in the world, this is by far the best as well as one of the most challenging of the group. I haven't had the chance to listen to their other songs. However, just three songs have introduced me into their own world of gloomy lyrics and sadness, yet with a fast pace to it.
B00006GO9Q|1.0|...as soon as you listen to it once, you're going to want the Complete Sessions boxset!  :)
B0007M22TI|5.0|I highly recommend this DVD. I went ahead and purchased the CD at the same time. I suggest you do the same as this saves you money. You will want the other after you have purchased the DVD or CD anyhow. The voices are truly heavenly. I wasn't a big fan of Irish music before purchasing this. I am now a huge fan because of Celtic Woman. The vocals, orchestra, and harmonies are awe inspiring. Pick this one up and just enjoy.
B00008WT5E|5.0|Ah, how far to go here?  Well, I'm older now, and I'm as 'zen' on this subject as any other.  Sooo...     Powerage is the best rock 'n roll of album of all time.  Not the most important or most influential; not with the widest variety nor highest reach(although this IS AC/DC's widest & highest album); not the most seductive or inspiring; but the best.     Sgt Pepper, Exile On Main Street, and Physical Grafitti are all timeless masterpieces too, but whatever Elvis, Chuck Berry, Buddy Holly, Little Richard & Jerry Lee Lewis were aiming at all those years ago, Powerage hit dead center.      An amazingly raw, blistering sound, but at the same time incredibly tight grooves.  Hard rock you can headbang AND dance to, indeed.  Like someone once said, AC/DC does what no one else can do, better than anyone else.    This was the first album w/Cliff Williams and he kicked the band up to a whole new level.  Fantastic production by Vanda/Young, the last one they did before Mutt Lange took over.  The remastering is indescribably brilliant, showcasing the equally brilliant interplay between Angus & Malcolm.  The lead & rhythm guitars are distinct, loud, and powerful.  No way you'd believe this album was released in 1978 if you didn't already know.    And what rhythms and leads they are.  Nine incredible riffs, instantly memorable.  Easy to play(the riffs NOT the solos, of course), perhaps, but almost impossible to write.  And the seven solos are among Angus' best, especially on Gone Shootin'.  Fast solos, medium solos, slow solos, and on Damnation & Bullet no solo at all.      There is simply not a wasted or extraneous second here.  Yngwie, Satriani, Vai, and all the rest of the shredders never wrote anything close to Sin City or Riff Raff.  This album is the one that clearly places Angus alongside Hendrix, Page, & Gibbons.    Bon's best lyrics, devastating beats from Cliff & Phil.  Highway To Hell's production sounds thin & poppy(despite the great songs), and Back In Black's writing seems somewhat uninspired and derivative in comparison.  Imagine the best qualities of Overdose, Touch Too Much, and Shoot To Thrill wrapped together and you have Powerage.    Back In Black has a great sound and all the legendary anthems, no question, but this is the real apex of the \\"cooler than a body on ice, hotter than the rolling dice, wilder than a drunken fight\\" ideal.  And all topped off by Bon giving you a wink/nudge and offering you another beer after each track.    I have friends that aren't into heavy music at all, but I always tell them that like Miles Davis' Kind Of Blue is to jazz, Powerage is the hard rock album for people that don't like hard rock.    Buy this album and you WILL burn tonight.
B0002OERI0|5.0|This is a great CD made by the Immortal Green Day Band and definately deserves a listen, the title and cover song may throw off the person about to buy the Cd but that doesn't mean that they anti- american or anything American Idiot is probably a new step to different aproaches to music their music but that doesn't at all make it bad music. American Idiot, She's A Rebel and other can get you hyped up while while Holiday makes you think about whats going in our country, Wake me up when September ends is a soft song and Jesus of Suburbia is all over the place but a great compilation and i think the best song on this album. the song are very catchy and you want to just keep listening, the one complaint is that there isn't enough  on this because this variaty of GREAT songs almost makes you wish that album wasn't over so soon. I am still listening almost a year after it was released
B00000J7SS|5.0|This may be the most overrated AND underrated jazz album, but it's a must just for the intense groove of Spanish Key and for Bernie Maupin's wonderful bass clarinet throughout.  I wonder if this might not be the best showcase for the BC on any album, jazz or classical. <br /> <br />For the ultimate chill-groove, I like to play Shh/Peaceful off In A Silent Way and then Spanish Key.  Don't get caught up in all the arguing, just get it.  John McLaughlin & Voodoo are also great songs and Pharoah's Dance & Bitches Brew are \\"growers\\" as well.   <br /> <br />Unfortunately, Feio is awful, the worst of the unissued tracks on the Complete Sessions box set.  The boxset is strictly for hardcore fans(despite all the great info in the booklet), while conversely the Silent Way boxset is extraordinary.
B00005JN2Z|5.0|Collateral isn't your typical movie.  Very well done, Jamie Foxx plays an almost obsessive taxi driver and delivers perfectly.  And Tom Cruise.. if you are a fan of tom cruise than you should definitely get this just because of how hip he is in this movie.  What I really liked about this movie was the characterization throughout it and how Cruise and Foxx both developed and changed throughout it.  That is something you don't see too much in movies nowadays and you can tell that this movie is not just another action movie.  Its very professional and you can tell the movie wasnt made just to make money, but to send an important message to the viewers instead.
B000000LZV|5.0|Usually my reviews conclude with a \\"Best Tracks\\" play-by-play, but in this case I'm going to take the easy route and skip that section.  That's because this is one of those albums that, yes, plays best as a cohesive whole.  Despite the fact that there are 43 tracks here, this album of short songs (most under 2 minutes) plays great from start to finish.  Like a punk version of side 2 of Abbey Road, the album runs through a series of songs that are diverse and unique but similar enough to sit comfortably next to each other.  My only complaint is that they left out the band's cool 45 second cover of Van Halen's \\"Ain't Talkin' 'Bout Love\\", along with another original track, in order to edit this double LP down to a single CD. <br /> <br />The Minutemen were always a punk band first and foremost, but there was so much more to their cound.  From the frenetic drumming of the underrated George Hurley, to D. Boon's incomparable singing style that owes a lot to Captain Beefheart, to the jazzy bass playing of Mike Watt, this power trio could really outplay the majority of punk bands at the time.  Adding a unique funk and skronk-y jazz flavor to their tunes, the band really had a sound all their own.  They were political, but never heavy-handed, funny but never unintentionally cheesy. The only thing even close was early Red Hot Chili Peppers, who hailed from the same So.Cal scene, but came a bit later and were clearly influenced by the Minutemen. <br /> <br />From the driving \\"Viet Nam\\" to the pistolero's theme \\"Corona\\", to the awesomely-riffed \\"West Germany\\" and the hypnotic \\"Jesus and Tequila\\", there's a lot to soak up here.  Mostly every tune reveals a hook, and those that don't are filled with lyrics that are either sublime, hilarious, or so strange their eminently enjoyable.  The band even includes an odd Steely Dan cover \\"Dr. Wu\\" with some great falsetto singing, a semi-ballad in \\"History Lesson-Part II\\", and a spoken word sort of thing in \\"Take 5, D\\" that sounds like something eccentric home-studio mastermind R. Stevie Moore might do.  There's a lot of oddball stuff here, but let the album sink in for a while and you'll really \\"get\\" what's going on here.  It's a real shame that D. Boon died so young, but this is a great testament to his originality.  This is an absolute milestone in college rock/punk/alternative music that is righteously revered by critics and fans alike.
B000002UAX|4.0|I just finished listening to this album on vinyl, and I gotta say that this is the best thing i have heard.  Some of the songs on this album i loved, some i didn't like so much, and some i really didn't like, but as a whole, this album is nearly flawless.  Even the songs that i didn't like were far superior to all that i had heard previously.  I even loved the insanity of revolution 9,and I think that good night was the best closer on any album that I have ever heard.  I especially loved how good night sharply contrasted with the madness of revolution 9.  In short, i love this album.  Though the beatles are probably not the greatest band in the world (as if such a thing would be possible), this is a album that i thoroughly enjoy.  By the way, A KID, you just like to piss me off don't you, so how about you take your shi##y reviews and shove 'em where the sun don't shine :)
B000002LCK|5.0|Substance shows New Order at their most edgy, experimental, and inventive stage.  The first two covers all their greatest songs never before captured on LP, and disc two mainly covers their heavily Joy Division inspired b-sides.  What great tunage is to be had here.  This album ups the ante for everything, it features extended, altered, and all around improved versions of numerous songs including Temptation, The Perfect Kiss, and Bizarre Love Triangle (which was pretty much butchered on Brotherhood).  The full length version of The Perfect Kiss is one of the greatest experiments ever captured on a recording, sounding almost completely improvised and practiced to perfection at the same time.  It also features the greatest combination of cowbell, bongos, and bass known to man.  Disc one also features the highly underrated Everything's Gone Green and Thieves Like Us (probably featuring Bernard at his best as far as vocals are concerned.  Disc one pretty much embodies the spirit of dance clubs in the 80's with Blue Monday, Confusion, and Shellshock.  The whole thing is as bass and keyboard heavy as hell.  What else can I say? One word, Temptation, greatest New Order track ever recorded.  This may be the most angst heavy dance track ever written, and probably shows Bernard at his lyrical hayday. <br /> <br />Disc two drops the whole dark, dancefloor mania that the first disc embodies and moves to the claustrophobic, brooding, Divisionesque, experimental b-sides, plus a few remixes thrown in for good measure.  The best stuff to be had here is the one-two punch of Cries & Whispers and Hurt.  The harmonium work in Hurt is most decidedly sweet.  Kiss of Death, a remix of Perfect Kiss, shows that the best remixers for New Order are themselves, as they strip most of the narrative lyrics laden in the original and  up the ante on the synths, and makes the track even better dancefloor material.  Shame of the Nation is a bit of misfire on this disc, probably due to the fact that the original track itself wasn't much to write home about.  Lonesome Tonight, however, features Bernard crooning at his best, and 1963 tells a great story that may or may not have to do with the shooting of JFK.  Why they decided not to stick some of these extraordinary b-sides on a proper LP is anyone's guess, but maybe it's for the better as it resulted in the creation of the one of the greatest double disc albums ever.
0449002632|5.0|I've read all of Edward Rutherfurd's book, and without a doubt London and Russka are his best works.  Although things move along quite quickly, there's more than enough detail to make you feel a part of each of the various time periods covered in his books.  If you've ever been to London or ever hope to visit it, you must read this book. <br /> <br />The only two negatives I would point out are that  <br />1. There's so much to tell, that Rutherford tends to skip most of the 19th and 20th centuries. <br />2. You're ultimately left with a feeling of emptyness at the end of the book because it was such an experience reading it, that you don't want it to end. <br /> <br />Highly recommended.
0440238609|5.0|I have read this trilogy about four times, and still I don't get tired of it. First, it's full of lovely characters - the free and uncaring Lyra, the ambiguous Lord Asriel and his wife Mrs. Coulter, bears, witches, Will, Mary Malone, etc. Second, the world is believable - Lyra and her daemon, for example, or the bears and witches that live in the North, or parallel worlds. Third, the book captures emotion - at the end of the book, you feel sorry for the characters and experience an upheaval at the fall of Metatron. <br />There were some confusing points in The Amber Spyglass, though - the idea that human \\"fall\\" is the salvation of the universe seemed a bit far-fetched to me. All those armies Lord Asriel gathered, all the Republic of Heaven he'd prepared for was utterly lost. <br />But the triumph of Lyra, Will and Mary, regardless of the realistic problems, felt brilliant.
B0007OCG4W|2.0|I agree with other reviewers when they say that Clive Owen, nasty as his character is, is the only thing vaguely remarkable about this depressing, senseless film.<br /><br />What is this movie trying to be? It's all about raunchy talk and twisted sexual innuendos and allusions and yet there's nothing really even approaching sex between the characters. The best I can figure is that the two leading ladies are prudes at heart. If a person wants to watch porno, obviously they can, but this movie needed to put a little bit more of its money where its mouth is if we're to get a feel for the deeper reality of the characters. All I came away with was a bad taste in my mouth from watching three and a half (Portman isn't quite as repugnantly immoral) backstabbers from hell. Law and Roberts deserve something horrid to befall them; what a couple of childish, lying, selfish monsters. Why would Owen want Roberts back the third time, simply revenge? At least his character was almost believable as some obsessive macho type with a bit of a (twisted) mind. Can't quite buy him as a doctor, though.<br /><br />I also definitely couldn't buy Portman's sudden about face with regard to Law at the end. Nobody who truly loves somebody as much as she supposedly loves Law could instantly and utterly write them off for simply wanting to know the truth. I couldn't really buy Portman in this role in general, actually. She seems like some kind of bleeding heart, Ivy League ______ Princess type in real life and I think that her playing a vagabond/stripper, no nudity mind you, is just one of those things actors try to do to show off their \\"range\\". I can't see her as anything other than Natalie Portman in anything she has yet played. She was promising in \\"The Professional\\" but has since never even matched her work in that film from the early 90s. I can't say I really get Roberts as a heartbreaker either. She has a unique look and vibe, but nothing to launch a thousand ships or drive a man to threatening murder. Glad that this one only cost me a dollar to rent, neighborhood promotion, and a couple hours of my time. Too pretentious and phony realistic; typical of a lot of modern plays...reatening murder.

078681859X|3.0|This story is a good read, almost only because of Bartimaeus, the sarcastic djinni whose tone and comments keep the readers going. The other main character, Nathaniel, is NOT likable, although I understood that his situation was dire. Nathaniel is a boy bent on revenge - but I could hardly feel his furiosity towards Simon Lovelace, a character even worse (if that is possible) than Nathaniel. <br />The story is not very fast-paced, because there are descriptions everywhere - descriptions, sadly, that are not necessary. The plot is not something you can relate to, because most people don't live their lives planning revenge. But the character Nathaniel is realistic, if detestable, and the world of magicians that he lives in is also realistic (although it is pretty much similar to Harry Potter). <br />There aren't any other main characters except for Bartimaeus and Nathaniel, which makes the story kind of repetitive and boring. But because of Bartimaeus, I give this book three stars. I hope that the next book has more intriguing characters.
0156027321|4.0|I passed this book up perhaps dozens of times in the bookstore, before finally relenting.  From the description on the back of the dust jacket, it just did not seem like a story that would interest me.  Plus, several of the review snippets on the book -- essentially praising the author for making a book with such a spare story into a great novel -- seemed to me a little like damning with faint praise.<br /><br />As it turns out, I was half right.  I didn't like the story very much.  Well, actually, I very much liked the first hundred pages or so, which took place on land and described our protaganist; a young Indian son-of-a-zookeepper.  But I found the story thereafter that took place at sea to be a little too slowly paced for my tastes.  And some of the gore -- particularly the detailed discussion of the butchering of various sea fish and animals -- was too repetitive and, well, gross.<br /><br />But, it turns out, the story of a boy on a boat with a tiger is not really what the novel is \\"about\\" at all.  Instead, it's a novel that uses its backstory to ask a straightforward question:  Do we need stories and fables to believe in God?  (SPOILERS follow.)<br /><br />At the end of this novel, we are confronted squarely with enduring questions about the limits of faith.  How can we believe in God when a wonderful, kind, vegan, pious boy endures tragedy for no good reason?  How can that boy continue to believe in God when he witnesses, first hand, how human nature emerges in its cruelest form as 4 castaways on a life boat essentially turn into animals in less than 24 hours.  How can he believe in God when he watches helplessly as his mother is brutally murdered for no discernable reason?  And how can any of us believe in God when extraordinary measures turn this gentle, pious boy into a murderer himself?  Can we find God, this novel asks, solely in the \\"dry, yeastless, factuality\\" of this everyday world, where God seemingly refuses to intevene?<br /><br />The answer, the boy decides, is that we cannot.  We need the stories, the fables.  So the boy spins a yarn that we are told, \\"will make you believe in God\\" -- a phrase that seems filled with hope and faith in the book's first chapter but drenched in irony in its final chapter.<br /><br />It is interesting to read the other Amazon reviews -- many of which are simply outstanding.  But it appears that many of you take away from this novel a sense of spirituality and view it as a faith-reaffirming book.  I must respectfully disagree.  In fact, it is a book that is very pessimistic about faith and about the legends that various faiths use to help themselves believe.  Not that it is entirely bleak about faith; as Pi tells us, to ignore or doubt the fables and doubt the existence of God, \\"is to miss the better story,\\" and to live a life that, at least in Pi's view, is hardly worth living.  (And Pi practices what he preaches -- actively observing multiple faiths even years after his horrible experience.)  Still, the final message -- that \\"the story with the animals is better,\\" and \\"so it goes with God\\" is, in some senses, heartbreaking, and hardly faith-affirming.<br /><br />Still, a novel that makes you think about such things is difficult to criticize merely because its conclusions might be somewhat pessimistic.  And if you're afflicted with the type of mind that likes to continue to mull books over after you've put them down, this one will not disappoint.<br /><br />Or, maybe it's just a book about a boy and a tiger on a boat, in which case it's probably not worth reading.  (Insert smiley face.)
B000A6T1KE|2.0|I don't know how to say this any other way but to come out and say it. Nemesis is a Bad Film. I have enjoyed Star Trek for almost thirty years. When did Star Trek go so wrong, and who is responsible. If you ask me Star Trek went wrong when it lost it's best writers people like Ron Moore and Ira Stephen Bare. The Next Generation had a rough start but when it got going was a terrific series thanks to people like Ron Moore who came along in the third season. Deep Space Nine was the Last good Trek series. Voyager was horrible it's first two seasons and while it got better in later seasons did more harm than good. Just look at what the series did to the Borg, a once menacing villain reduced to toothless jokes. The Only Time I enjoyed Voyaer was when barclay and the Dr. were featured at least they had character. If Voyager nearly killed trek Enterprise put the final nail in the coffin, I mean could there have been a duller show. The Entire cast was flat and devoid of personality including Scott Backula. He was wonderful in quantum leap, what happened. Bad Writing perhaps ?  Much of the Blame has to be with Rick Berman and Brannon Braga. If Trek is ever brought back jettisoning these two morons should be on the top of the list.     Nemesis is one of the most derivative films I have ever seen. It borrows heavily from Star Trek II, but has none of its charm. The only next Generation film I thought was fun to watch was First Contact. It was a roller coaster ride and didn't apologize for being so. Star Trek Generations had its moments, but was a very flawed movie. Insurrection was goofy and not in a good way.  It's painful watching a great cast of actors muttering through such poorly written dialogue in a story thats not going anywhere. I think what pains me the most when I watched this movie was here I was sitting in the theater watching the end of trek.  The Next Generation cast, people we have come to care about were hung up on the tracks and staring down a looming freighttrain. I hope I get to see the TNG group one more time but only if its in the capable hands of good writers.
B0000042MY|5.0|First off I have no musical knowledge whatsoever.  I don't know what a stanza is and I don't what c flat means.  I was completely lost in my mandatory music classes in grade school.  In college I was offended that I had to take a music appreciation course.  I managed to squeak by with a C because of lots of extra credit.    Why would I think to review something like this?  I obviously cannot give any great insights into the music.  I don't know why one part is riveting and another is tantalyzing.    What I do know is that this is simply an outstanding score (ok I do know it is called a score and not a soundtrack).  This is how I judge music.  If it sounds good then it is good.  I don't care about the history or its purpose.  Just the overall feel to it.    I have used this CD to relax to, to study to, and if I were a new age flake I might even meditate to it.  Great CD buy it now.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is such a great series, with original, complex characters and solid stories.  Antoher winner from Joss Whedon!  Even though only fourteen episodes were made, it is well worth the purchase.  I can't wait to see the movie this fall!
0800196341|4.0|I spent a whole afternoon watching Branaugh's version, and while I loved it, there were a few minor things that irked me in his rendition. <br /> <br />First of all, I have issues with Branaugh playing Hamlet, simply because of his age--and I have the same issue with Gibson playing Hamlet.  I always pictured the Prince of Denmark to be younger.  After all, he is a scholar.  Though Branaugh's in-your-face portrayal is simply delightful. <br /> <br />There are some who abide by the interpretation that the relationship between Hamlet and Ophelia is more physical than some have let on and that Ophelia is in fact pregnant.  I know that this is hinted at in Ophelia's \\"mad scene\\", though I really don't buy it.  Hamlet comes home from school--it's not like Ophelia could have had a chance to sneak into his \\"dorm room.\\" <br /> <br />But enough of the interpretation issues.  Wonderful performances given by all, though I do believe Jacobi really shines as Claudius, and I could almost relate to him.  There are wonderful cameos from Charlton Heston, Jack Lemmon, as well as Robin Williams and Billy Crystal(such uncommon casting that is common to Branaugh productions). <br /> <br />Visually stunning, this is a must see for Shakespeare fans.
B00070DK14|5.0|Broadsword and the Beast is definitly not one of my favorite Tull albums, but lets face it. It's still Jethro Tull. This album is still awesome. It is just a little too electronic, but that is what most bands were experimenting with at the time. The highlights of the album for me are Fallen on Hard Times, Flying Colours, Slow Marching Band, and Broadsword. Though it may not be be close to their best, its still exellent. I would not recommend buying it if you're just getting into Tull, but if you already have four or five of their albums, give this one a try.
B000006TRV|5.0|I've always loved the Dark Side of the Moon Album and seeing Waters and Gilmour back together on stage at Live 8 made me want to listen to the Wall--- and let me tell you, this is one of their best works. <br />The ultimate tragic rock star story told by one of the greatest classic rock bands of all time. Great rock anthems such as \\"Young Lust\\" \\"Another Brick in the Wall Part One\\" \\"Run Like Hell\\" \\"Hey You\\" and of course the \\"Happiest Days of our Lives/Another Brick in the Wall Part Two\\" combo combined with some other memorable tunes such as \\"In the Flesh/On Thin Ice\\" \\"Comfortably Numb\\" and \\"Mother\\" make this a must own album. <br />Now of course you have those weirder songs as \\"The Trial\\", \\"In the Flesh\\" (the second one) , and \\"Vera\\" but they do not take away from this true rock opera (to which the self proclaimed rock opera \\"American Idiot\\" makes no comparison) <br />PLEASE FLOYD HEAR MY PLEA...GO BACK ON TOUR AND LIBERATE THOSE HELD HOSTAGE BY TODAYS MUSIC WITH YOUR GREATNESS
B00008G9JN|5.0|This is my second favorite Jethro Tull album after Thick as a Brick. I would recommend it especially for people who like the more folk/rock side of Tull (i do).
B0000BYM3K|2.0|If it weren't Maiden, it would be one star, believe me.  I have been listening to Maiden since the first album came out, learned to play bass listening to Steve Harris.  I love the band. <br /> <br />This is just awful.  Nothing, but nothing inspires me on this album at all.  It's not worth delving into details about the specific reasons I don't like this album; it's just boring.
0380713802|5.0|I bought this book for an aquaintance, a young guy with a good sense of humor and dreams of backpacking across europe, and couldn't resist reading it before passing it on.  It really is hysterical, moving at a less tedious pace than some of his other travelogues.  Bryson's ability to ridicule others (and himself!) and have it come off as endearing not an insult is remarkable, and the humor isn't forced, suprisingly poignant observations blend right in.  The gift was quite a hit!
B00005JNSK|5.0|Another Burton classic.  As dark and rich as you're likely going to be able to swallow, but watch out for the nuts!  And this movie is full of oddballs, weirdos, nuts as well as several squirrels.   <br /> <br />As usual, Depp adds an unsettling twist to the character of Wonka that makes him interesting and just a tad obnoxious.  This version of the movie more accurately approaches the character in the book than the Wilder movie did ( but I like that one too.)  The cinematography is breathtaking in scope and detail with special effects that will please the most finicky of viewers.  The acting from the children is flawless, they almost steal the show away from Depp.  Almost.  And last, Elfman's score is one of his best to date; menacing, creepy but playful and intelligent.  Unlike the original movie, you can actually look forward to the next Oompa Loompa song in this rendition.  The only real drawback to me was a decision to overdue the digital makeup on Depp and some of the children in the cast.  Their skin almost looks plastic and distracted me more often than it should have.  Then again, I did see it in an IMAX theater so it was more obvious but the movie is larger than life so the huge screen was definitely a treat!
B0006284JQ|5.0|1st of all I must say that if you actually wrote a bad review for this album you need to get a life. It's a Greatest Hits CD, so if you don't like Britney you can be pretty sure that you're not going to like this album (DUH!!!). 2nd, for the person that thinks that this is a mere collection of every single that she has released...WRONG!!! I can count 4 singles that are not on that album. 3rd, Britney Spears is GREAT!!! No she's not the best singer in the world and but she is an ENTERTAINER! I'm sure you can't name one person that puts on a show better than her. And yes she Lip Syncs, but I don't kno anyone who can dance like she does and hold a note...she does however sing the slow songs live. And just FYI anyone that dances and sings at the same time lip syncs or sounds really bad like Usher does cuz dancing takes a lot of breathing. But anyway...Britney is great and if you don't like her all I'm trying to understand is why you clicked on the link labled \\"Britney Spears. Greatest Hits: My Perogative\\"?
0780622553|5.0|Beware for those of you wanting to watch an action/ sci-fi movie as this isn't like that. There isn't a lot of action whatsoever or not even that much suspense, but the movie is very interesting, exciting and unlike anything else that you've ever seen before.  <br />This movie is visually stunning and has a very powerful score that goes along with everything that's happening in the movie. <br />This movie is definitely one of the best that I have ever seen.  <br />The movie is about a man waking up with a body next to him and not remembering anything from his past (complete memory loss) From then on, he's wanted for murder and hunted down by mysterious beings called strangers who can stop/control time. The title of the movie is clearly illustrated throughout the movie as there is basically no sun.  <br />I don't want to give away anything else about the movie so that you can discover this amazing movie on your own! Believe me, this is one movie that everyone should see. The plot and story of this movie is so remarquable and is probably the best and most interesting plot ever in a movie. This is a movie that you don't want to miss out on and is a treat to the audience thanks to its stunning visuals, remarquable plot, excellent music/score and great acting!
B0002XNSY0|5.0|This review is for the 40th Anniversary Special Edition released by Columbia/Tristar in 2004.    The movie \\"Dr. Strangelove, or How I learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb\\" is a cold-war black comedy that satirizes the nuclear arms race between superpower governments.  The  basic story line takes place in the early 1960's where a psychologically unstable U.S. Air Force Brigadier General named Jack D. Ripper (Sterling Hayden) orders a surprise nuclear attack on Russia from a NATO base in England.  The attack is to be made by deploying a series of squadrons of B-52 bombers which are ordered to drop nuclear missiles on strategic locals within Russia.  When Washington finds out about this unprovoked attack, an emergency meeting is held in the Pentagon's War Room where restrained hysteria and pandemonium begin.    British actor Peter Sellers plays three characters in this movie: Royal Air Force Captain Lionel Mandrake, U. S. President Merkin Muffley and German physicist Dr. Strangelove.  The Mandrake and Muffley roles are strictly deadpan comedy, while the Strangelove character uses a lot of physical comedy and overtly humorous rants regarding nuclear annihilation.  I found Sellers especially impressive in the role as the U.S. president, due to his authentic-sounding American accent.     Arguably the strongest performance in the movie belongs to George C. Scott in his portrayal as U.S. General 'Buck' Turgidson.  His animated body movement and overly emotional facial expressions steal the show.  Another notable performance is by the tobacco-chewing cowboy actor Slim Pickens who plays B-52 pilot Major T.J. 'King' Kong.  Pickens' exiting scene in the movie is visually one of the greatest in the history of filmmaking.  The humor in this movie is constant but subtle.  My only critical comment about the movie is that I feel the final scene in the war room was extraneous and too over the top.  But still, this is a superb film.      As for the DVD, since this was a \\"specialedition\\" package, one would expect a fully restored version, but this wasn't the case.  There isn't much film deterioration, but you'll see an occasional spec of film wear here and there.  All in all, its a very sharp black and white transfer.  The sound is very satisfactory.    There are plenty of special features contained in this package including brief cold war documentaries by Roger Ebert, Bob Woodward, Robert McNamara and Spike Lee.  Most of the observations were overstating the obvious, but it was interesting to observe as best as I can recall that no one admitted that the arms race is what ultimately defeated communism in Russia in the 1980's.  I did feel that Spike Lee's comments were particularly inane however.  Another documentary included a more in depth examination of the cold war era by former Secretary of Defense Robert McNamara.  There was also a too-brief feature of the career of Peter Sellers.  Another bonus feature which was by far the best, was the making of the film Dr. Strangelove.  In this we learn many things including the fact that Peter Sellers was originally cast as the B-52 pilot but was later replaced by Slim Pickens.  In addition we learn that the final scene in the movie was a pie fight, but was left on the editing room floor.  We also learn that a special screening was scheduled for November 22, 1963, the day that JFK was assassinated, so the film was postponed and edited slightly to remove a comment by Pickens where he mentions, \\"....a guy could have a good time in Dallas....\\".  The word \\"Dallas\\" was changed to \\"Las Vegas\\".  There is also a nice biographical feature on director Stanley Kubrick.  My overall assessment of the package is that it was significantly overpriced for quality of material, and again, not to have a fully restored movie for $28 is a travesty in my opinion.        Movie: A+    DVD Quality: A-
B00005JLWN|5.0|Equilibrium is a movie that follows in the footsteps of the Matrix, yet is better than its predecessor in every possible way. The acting is excellent notably by Christian Bale, who isa much better actor than Keannu Reeves. Bale should have been Neo. It would have been a much better movie. The plot of Equilibrium is better and the fights are even better! The plot of this movie is thought provoking, very original and very memorable. The movie is set in the future in a very change world after World War III. In this future, feelings of any kind are outlawed as are objects that provoke feelings. Everyone injects themselves so that they never feel. Christian Bale plays a cop that finds sense offenders and arrests them. But this world is depressing and weird. Christian Bale's character can't take it anymore and becomes the leader of the rebellion against this world. <br />The movie is very moving and interesting, and the fight scenes are absolutely amazing. The final fight is AWESOME and very memorable!  <br />This movie is worth a buy thanks to the amazing fights and the memoralbe story! This movie IS better than the Matrix in every possible way and I strongly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch a good action/ sci fi movie. It has some of the most memorable fighting scenes ever and everything just seems to click in this awesome movie.
B0002XL35G|4.0|This review is for the 2004 DVD release by 20th Century Fox.  <br /> <br />I really loved the look of this movie when it started in West Texas and the cinematography was astounding. The soundtrack by Ry Cooder also fit the mood of the desert perfectly. The main character is Travis, (Harry Dean Stanton), who wanders recklessly in the Texas desert. He is later rescued by his brother Walt (Dean Stockwell), and Walt takes him back to Los Angeles to be with Walt's wife and Hunter, the son of Travis whom he abandoned 4 years earlier. We see the household situation that Hunter has been placed in with Walt and his loving wife the past several years and it seems very healthy and stable.  <br /> <br />The film slowly moves in a direction where it appears that Travis wants to put his life back in order. Finally there is a plan to reunite Travis, his son and estranged wife Jane (Nastassja Kinski). After some amateur detective work they find Jane in Houston. There is one powerful scene where Travis confesses to Jane why he left her.  The final outcome is a blemish for this film in my opinion - especially the social placement of the young boy (if you realize in what situation he was in when the movie started and what circumstance he was in when the film ended).  But all in all, it's a beautifully filmed movie that's very good, but a better ending could have made it a great movie. <br /> <br />The DVD picture quality and audio are first rate.  The only bonus feature is optional real-time commentary by director Wim Wenders. <br /> <br /> <br />Movie: B  <br /> <br />DVD Quality: A
B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay has achieved great recognition prior to the release of their third album X&Y.  They did this by creating a sound so unique while at the same time appealing to mass audiences.  I have no arguements that this album is a great album, but their unique sound seems to be made up of other influences.  In some ways Coldplay represents a watered-down version of Radiohead, this was apparent in the first two albums but not the the extreme in this third album, X&Y.  When you listen to this album it will seem as though you have heard this album many times before, making it almost predictable.  Even their first single off this album, Speed of Sound, resembles one previous hit, Clocks, greatly.  Although this album is a good album, thats all it is, a good album.
B0000DD7LC|1.0|It's too late for some people. This girl doesn't need your money anymore. She's sold out to Pro-Activ makeup to cover her blemishes. Too bad no amount of creme is going to cover up her total lack of talent. Message to the world: try listening to an album without watching the video first, you might not really like her music that much.    Oh, one more thing: why in the world does she braid her hair in such irratic cornrows? You'd think she'd figure out how to cut a straight hedge. Oops, I forgot, she's more worried about her acne!!
B00012QKSI|5.0|The CD may seem seasonal but is much more. It's worth purchasing just for the cuts by Kelly Clarkson, Dido,Nora Jones and Eva Cassidy, to say nothing of the vintage Beach Boy's song,\\"God Only Knows\\". Outstanding compilation; hands down, thumbs up, 5 stars!!!
0451169514|5.0|I read Stephen King's \\"It\\" in the year 1988. Since then I've re-read it 3 times. And i've got to be honest - it's the best book he's ever written.(And yes, I've read them all!) If I could, I'd rate him with 50 STARS for this novel! <br /> <br />The story, the characters....with so much depth...it actually makes you feel as though you are with them every step of the way. <br /> <br />Take my word....you'll absolutly love this story.
B00006I53S|5.0|I bought this lens last year for my first Rebel (300D).  I used it a lot to take indoor shots with and without a flash (the 420EX Speedlight works well with this lens).  I've been able to photograph my daughters' (both) at various school events (band, chorus, etc) with and without a flash. <br /> <br />I just upgraded my Rebel to the Rebel XT (350) and this lens works even better at the higher resolution! <br /> <br />I recently started using it for more obscure things like nature closeups.  The lens is a dream in this capacity as you sometimes have to hunt around a lot to find your \\"target\\" and only have a few shots before it is gone again.  The IS helps ensure that one of those few shots work out well. <br /> <br />If I have a complaint, it is the size.  It is rather long, and was a pain in the neck before I bought a new bag.  I took a leap of faith and decided to replace this lens with the new Tamron 18-200mm Di II Zoom.  Well, after about a week & half the Tamron was packaged up and is heading back.  There is no competition!  Should Canon decide to go the \\"DO\\" route and shrink this lens (like they did with the 70-300) I might replace this one, until then it is \\"stuck\\" on my Rebel XT. <br /> <br />Oh yeah, important stuff:  The IS feature uses power from the camera battery.  On the behemoth of a battery on the original Rebel, I could go on and on.  With the XT, however, I seem to get about 300 - 400 photos before having to recharge the battery (even then it is about 1/2 full).  So far this is not a very big issue. <br /> <br />
0736041850|5.0|This book without question hands down is the best bodybuilding book I have ever seen. It breaks down what each exercise is, and what muscle groups you use. It also shows you the correct method and form of how to perform the excersise. <br /> <br />There are a lot of books out there, but this one really takes the cake. Plus its cheap too which makes this even a sweeter deal. <br /> <br />
B0002OERI0|5.0|I picked up this cd a few weeks ago after hearing the song American Idiot and loved it!  I always heard their music on the radio, but never purchased any music by them, but decided to give them a try...I found myself liking Green Day.  This band Rocks!  I love the songs...Holiday--She's a rebel and American Idiot.  Great band!  Now, I will buy their first release Warning, which I hear is as good as this one!
B000065V9Y|5.0|A controversial title to fans, perhaps, but in my opinion this (and the Secret World live album) is Peter Gabriel at the height of his powers.  <br />Soulful, original lyrics provide beautiful imagery - almost as beautiful as the carefully woven threads of percussion joining together. Gabriel's voice, showing its age, is heartfelt and full of yearning and melancholy.  <br /> <br />There are many places to start, if you are interested in Peter Gabriel and this is as good as any. Accessible without compromising any of his talent this album, largely about relationships, can speak to many. With grace and beauty. <br /> <br />
0066620996|5.0|So many business books seem fluffy and shallow -- or else they're written so stiffly I can't stay awake.<br /><br />Collins creates an entertaining narrative as he contrasts pairs of companies: A&P vs. Kroger, Abbott vs Upjohn, and more.  Why do some survive and become great while others quietl fade away?<br /><br />Unlike many authors who share cozy anecdotes, Collins offers solid analytical distinctions.  The survivors faced reality, recognized their strengths, got rid of deadwood and provided quiet leadership.<br /><br />My favorite chapter features the Stockdale paradox. During eight grueling years as a Vietnam POW, Admiral Jim Stockdale determined he would survive and would save as many fellow POWs as<br /><br />possible. Regardless of anyone's position on war and military, Stockdale demonstrated rare courage and was credited with saving many lives.<br /><br />When Collins asked, \\"Who was least likely to survive?\\" Stockdale said, \\"That's easy - the optimists.\\"  Those who anticipated being home by Christmas were the most discouraged-- most likely to give up on living.<br /><br />In a world of chirpy coaches urging us to \\"Think positive,\\" this view seems realistic and refreshing.<br /><br />I also liked the story of Nucor, a small company that outpaced Bethlehem Steel. While Bethlehem built office tours to accommodate demands for corner offices, Nucor stayed lean and mean. I love the story of a union's attempts to organize Nucor: Management actually had to protect the union organizers from the wrath of the workers!<br /><br />The book is easy to read and hard to put down. And the lessons learned will remain with readers for a long time.

B00000AFFI|5.0|PJ Harvey is a gifted songwriter and a great performer. She also tends to write about things you don't want to hear about and shout them for everyone to hear, much like Patti Smith and Tori Amos. This record is not different. Desire can be beautiful and destructive. Here, Ms. Harvey concentrates on the destructive face but she also includes so much beauty in this album, that its eerie effect is coated with sugar.  <br />Monologues of love, dusty lust, hidden passion, sexual madness, and personal resilience are a few of the themes she handles here, each one in a seperate short story with its own players.  <br />The songwriter PJ Harvey takes a while to get used to because of her ventures into hard sonic and lyrical terrain, but when a listener gives this more than one or two tries, he/she will comprehend the artist's strong vision. <br />The performer Harvey is, however, going to leave audiences stupefied. She plays every character of each short story of this with fire, dedication and chameleon skills. You can hear the fragile prostitute of \\"Angelene\\", and you can hear the creeping madness in every word of \\"Perfect Day, Elise\\". The erotic promise of \\"No Girl so Sweet\\" manages to be sensual and dirty without becoming crude. <br />Thousands of albums about desire have been released. What makes this difference is the respect to the listener and PJ Harvey's skill and obvious amount of work
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I would say buy this only and I mean only if you did not buy the Limited Edition Collector's edition released a couple of years ago.  That was a 2 disc set that inclcuded the Original E.T. and the Updated one which I bought I would not buy this single disc set with the updated movie only.  However if you do not own E.t. on Dvd buy this becuase you cannot get the collector's edition acept for buying it from a 3rd party here on Amazon but as said for us who own the collector;s edition this dvd is not worth the purchase.  The 5 star rating is for E.t. is one of my favorite movies this release gets a 1 star based on the collector;s edition is much better.
0679759328|5.0|In her novel, Mrs Brookner portrays a middle-aged writer of romantic fiction, Edith Hope. People claim that there is a certain resemblance with Virginia Woolf in her features. At any rate her novels are published under the pen-name of Vanessa Wilde and they bear such titles as \\"The Sun at Midnight\\", \\"Beneath the Visiting Mood\\" or \\"The Stone and the Star\\". Edith doesn't seem to hold writing in high esteem. She describes this activity more like a compulsion: \\"she bent her head obediently to her daily task of fantasy and obfuscation\\", enjoying a rest \\"after her obscure and unnoticeable exertions\\". In fact she even considers reading as a kind of cure for the psychologically diseased: \\"Fiction, the time honoured resource of the ill-at-ease...\\" <br />After settling down at the Hotel du Lac - set in a small village on the Swiss shore of lake Geneva - Edith meets her extravagant fellow lodgers: Iris Pusey and her daughter Jennifer, Mme de Bonneuil and Monica accompanied by her insufferable dog Kiki. During her numerous discussions with these women, Edith starts reflecting on the life she has led so far and on love in general. The reader also learns about her past and her troubled relationship with her mother. And it is not before the end of the novel that we discover why Edith came to the Hotel du Lac, why she left London in such a haste and what exactly the \\"unfortunate lapse\\" was which brought her to her temporary exile in Switzerland. <br />Like one critic said about \\"Hotel du Lac\\": \\"Novels like Anita Brookner's are why we read novels\\".

B0006VXLOK|5.0|Source: Studio recording made in October 1953.<br /><br />Sound: Generally good 1950s mono. (Opera d'Oro issues are always iffy on matters of sound, ranging from very good to appallingly bad.  They are generally much safer bets when based on studio recordings, as is the case here, than on live performances.)<br /><br />Text: Standard text adopted with the first revivals of the opera, some years after Bizet's death.<br /><br />Cast: Nadir - Leopold Simoneau; Zurga - Rene Bianco; Leila - Pierette Alarie; Nourabad - Xavier Depraz. Conductor: Jean Fournet.<br /><br />Documentation: No libretto.  Short plot summary.  Track list.<br /><br />This performance provided my first recording of \\"Les Pecheurs de perles,\\" acquired more than forty-five years ago on Lp from some obscure European publisher. Having stumbled upon a CD version of the old warhorse, I was greatly pleased to find that it is as good as I had remembered it to be.<br /><br />By 1863, the 25 year-old Bizet had already set his hand to incidental music to \\"L'Arlesienne,\\" the requisite Sir Walter Scott opera, \\"La jolie fille de Perth\\" and an oriental opera, \\"Djamileh.\\" He had not yet wrung the hankering for exoticism out of his system, so he embarked on a new opera to be set in pre-Columbian Mexico. With youthful folly, he began writing the music before his two hack librettists, Michel Carre and Eugene Cormon, had figured out a finish for the play. Even before the lack of a finale became a crisis, a major change had to be incorporated. It seems that the \\"Pearlfishers\\" team had been beaten in the race to put on an Aztec play in Paris. Since Carre and Cormon had probably known nothing at all about Meso-American empires, it is likely they had no qualms about shifting their story to another place they knew nothing about, Ceylon. Carr&eacute; and Cormon never did come up with a logical finish, so they just set things on fire and let the doomed lovers depart into the sunset, providing a dramatic arc to \\"The Pearlfishers\\" that makes \\"Il trovatore\\" look like a textbook example of a well-made play.<br /><br />I had remembered the star of the recording to be the tenor, Leopold Simoneau, and so he is. Simoneau had a voice of no great size but of surpassing sweetness and elegance. I have seen him described as a latter day Tito Schipa. To some extent he was, but Simoneau was a true vocal technician, far more skillful than that charming old con man, Schipa. Simoneau's Nadir is more focused on the beauty of the musical line than on drama. In this most lyrical of Bizet's operas, it works.<br /><br />What I had not remembered about this recording was Pierette Alarie. Alarie was a formidable lieder singer who was married to Simoneau and who made many recordings with him. By operatic standards, her voice was small, but it was beautifully pure, precisely focused and amazingly agile, a sort of Francophone Roberta Peters. (For those familiar with Webber's \\"Phantom of the Opera,\\" Alarie was precisely the type of singer for the role of the Phantom's young protegee.) All those years ago, I was busy being bowled over by Milanov, Tebaldi, Nilsson and Sutherland, so I foolishly discounted Alarie's smaller voice. While I still hold those ladies in highest esteem, this time, when I bought the CD, I actually listened to Alarie and I was amazed. This was particularly true of the closing number of the First Act, \\"O dieu Brahma.\\" In every other performance that I have seen or heard, heavier-voiced sopranos make this prayer pleasant enough but nothing to compete with the acknowledged big numbers of the act, \\"Au fond du temple saint,\\" and \\"Je crois entendre encore.\\" Alarie's version is a revelation. With her lieder singer's discrimination and her phenomenal vocal agility, Alarie offers up a bel canto-like gem.<br /><br />The Zurga of this set, while good, was simply not in the class of Simoneau and Alarie. Ren&eacute; Bianco had a baritone voice that was pleasant but not at all commanding, not the best thingfor portraying a character who is all assertiveness. The slight fuzziness of his vocal production kept Bianco from being an equal with the super-focused Simoneau and Alarie in the ensembles.<br /><br />Nourabad is a thankless part, placed in the opera merely to keep the plot ticking. I remember nothing about any Nourabad I have seen or heard in the past. I remember nothing about Xavier Depraz beyond the obvious fact that he was not bad enough to make me remember him for that reason.<br /><br />The first time I listened to these CDs, I found myself puzzled by the conducting. Jean Fournet was a big name in the French repertory in the years straddling World War II. As I had been particularly impressed by his dramatic \\"Samson et Dalila,\\" the comparative looseness of dramatic tension here seemed odd. After comparing his version of \\"The Pearlfishers\\" with those of Rosenthal, Dervaux and Pretre, I think it probable that there was mutual agreement among Fournet, Simoneau and Alarie to downplay melodrama in favor of musicality, to take a miniaturist, even lieder-like approach. Of the four conductors, Fournet is the most precise and the most French. \\"The Pearlfishers\\" may take place on exotic Ceylon, but Jean Fournet's Ceylon is firmly anchored in the Seine, not many meters downstream from the Cathedral of Notre Dame.<br /><br />This is an excellent \\"Pearlfishers.\\" This version and the excellent 1959 live version conducted by Manuel Rosenthal (Gala GL 100.504), which emphasizes the drama of the opera, should be in any serious collection.<br /><br />Five stars.his vocal production kept Bianco from being an equal with the super-focused Simoneau and Alarie in the ensembles.

B00025ETIW|5.0|4 months straight of listening to this album and it still ROCKS!!! 10 out of 10. After seeing a snippet of \\"My Helena\\" video(4months ago), I had to hear more. Buy the album. It won't disappoint.
B0009KA7BS|3.0|Let me say this up-front: I'm a huge fan of the \\"Hellblazer\\" comic book, especially the long run by Garth Ennis and Steve Dillon. So I was more than a little nervous about this movie. But at the same time, I also like films like this, even when they're not connected to any existing franchise.<br /><br />\\"Constantine\\" feels like it both took too little from the comic books and not enough, which is a neat trick. There's likely a heck of a good movie on the cutting room floor or, more likely, in previous versions of the scripts that were sliced and spliced together to make the theatrical version of the film.<br /><br />Keanu Reeves plays LA detective John Constantine or, as he says it, \\"John Constantine, a-hole.\\" That's a cute line, but it points to one of the major problems with the film: It's Schwarzeneggerized. Dialogue in the movie, for the most part, consists of clever catch phrases (and we know \\"John Constantine, a-hole\\" is a catch phrase because a riff is done on it by another character within the first minute of Reeves saying it in the movie). Is he an a-hole? Hard to tell: In the comics, he certainly is -- John Constantine in \\"Hellblazer\\" will sacrifice small children to save a city, or sell someone else's soul for a marginally improved chance of defeating an enemy. In the film, Reeves' Constantine is mostly just moody, but we never heard him say \\"I'm Neo, a-hole\\" or \\"I'm either Bill or Ted, a-hole\\" in previous movies, despite his Constantine not being dramatically different from any of his other roles. But it's a cute line, so we're stuck with it.<br /><br />In the comics, these clever bits that Constantine says are spaced out over several issues and we see a lot more of his street level grungy street magic. He's not a cool guy, he's a failed human being who happens to pull a rabbit out of his hat and save the day, once in a while, but at great cost to everyone around him. In the movie, we get all the cool bits and none of the context. This is Neo in wool instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality.<br /><br />Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically \\"Hellblazer\\" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences. As a result, the actual plot of the movie comes suddenly at the end, and it feels as though most of what came before was unneeded, and it probably was.<br /><br />Having said that, the film looks like a million bucks, whether it's cinematography, special effects or costuming. You can certainly see where they spent the money they saved on having a solid script doctor come in and clean things up afterwards.<br /><br />Those interested in the subject matter -- a war between Heaven and Hell in a modern urban landscape -- would be better advised to pick up the Ennis/Dillon \\"Hellblazer\\" paperbacks (all of which are available here at Amazon) instead. \\"Hellblazer\\" fans would be advised to rent this, at most.<br /><br />Someone, someday, will make a great gritty supernatural thriller set on the mean streets of London. \\"Constantine\\" isn't it, and isn't even a particularly satisfying appetizer for that film.ol instead of leather and using magic instead of virtual reality. <br /> <br />Likewise, the story, involving the Devil's son, angels and demons involved in a cold war on Earth and twin psychics, is very authentically \\"Hellblazer\\" -- specifically, it hits a lot of the moments in the Ennis/Dillon run -- but where it should explain, it skims and where it should move quickly, it broods on arty sequences.

B0002IU988|4.0|I'm a fan of a lot of Creed's music, and when I heard about this album, I went and checked it out. While they are not Creed Redux (which is a good thing,  they have their own sound), Alter Bridge does have a similar feeling to a lot of Creed's ballads. The vocalist here, Myles, is better musically than Scott Stapp, hands down. Scott's voice was good for Creed's lyrics, but this brother Myles can WAIL, man. I like the heavier guitar emphasis, and my fave tracks are \\"Find the Real\\" and \\"Broken Wings\\". I also like \\"In Loving Memory\\" and \\"Watch Your Words.\\"  There are no really weak tracks on the album IMO, and I'm willing to check out their later releases.
0440180295|5.0|Superficially, this book is a simple story about an American, Billy Pilgrim, who is captured by German forces and housed in a slaughterhouse in Dresden.  There, he witnesses the horrible firebombing of the city by Allied forces.  Eventually he returns home and marries and takes over the family optometry business. <br /> <br />A secondary stream flows underneath this basic story.  Billy Pilgrim is purportedly able to travel through time.  He is also abducted by aliens and kept in their zoo with a young starlet as his \\"mate\\". <br /> <br />Vonnegut's prose is simple, clear, and powerful.  It is all plain English, and he doesn't make any effort to dress up the story with anything pretensions.  Reading his work is refreshing because he never talks down to the reader, he just tells the story.  (In this sense, he is a lot like Nabokov but with a smidgen less zest.) <br /> <br />Delve deeper into the meaning of the story, though, and you will find that the story is as deep as you want to go.  Billy Pilgrim is obviously \\"shell-shocked\\" and suffering internally, though from all outward appearances he seems to be fine.  In his own mind he thinks himself fine, though his frequent flashbacks to his past and his imaginary alien abduction tell otherwise.  So what exactly is going on with Billy? <br /> <br />If all this is happening to Billy, what is Vonnegut trying to say?  What are the demons that haunt him, the author?  Vonnegut, too, was at the Dresden firebombing, and in a very real sense this book is his attempt at self-therapy.  How much of Vonnegut is reflected in Billy? <br /> <br />The aliens are presented not as time travelers, but as beings that simply \\"are\\".  They, as well as Billy, see time as a solid mass which can be examined in any order.  Therefore, to them, wars are inevitable, as too are happy times.  The key, they tell Billy, is to look at the happy times rather than dwell on the sad times.  However, the realness of the aliens is certainly in doubt.  Perhaps Billy created the aliens, or picked up the idea from a book, in order to help him cope with his internal pain. <br /> <br />The book has a strong anti-war message, but it doesn't beat you over the head with it.  The most repeated phrase is \\"So it goes\\" which is a way to accept a preordained fate as it comes, but perhaps we don't have to accept that fate is preordained, that we have free-will to choose our fate.  The aliens would scoff at this, but if Vonnegut meant for this to be an anti-war novel, then he must believe that we can control our fate enough to avoid war. <br /> <br />The book is a great read.  It is easy enough for young students and meaningful enough for older folks.  5 stars, easily.
B000005YZM|5.0|For over 30 years, I've procrastinated purchasing Odessey & Oracle.  What a mistake!  As others have stated, the Zombies were one of the great '60's bands, and this CD provides evidence. Listening to O&O is like tasting a fine wine which has nuances of a variety of flavors.  For example, \\"Care of Cell 44\\" is an homage to the Beach Boys' harmonies.  But if you listen carefully, vestiges of sounds from other '60's groups can be detected. The Beatles influence is evident on songs like \\"Hung up on a Dream (akin to \\"A Day in the Life\\"), and \\"Butcher's Tale\\", which is as lovely as \\"Eleanor Rigby\\".  Other vocalizations seem like a melange of flavors coming from vocal groups such as: The Moody Blues, the Association, the Turtles, the Small Faces, and Simon and Garfunkel.  This is not to say the Zombies are mimicking others; it is just that the songs are so rich and complex that the harmonies and melodies come together as a tribute to the aforementioned groups.  Still played frequently today, \\"Time of the Season\\" is pure Zombies, replete with Rod Argent's outstanding keyboards, and Colin Blunstone's sublime lead vocals. For me, the more I listen to O&O, the better it sounds, and the more I want to hear it again.  Just like the taste of a good bottle of wine.
B00000F14B|5.0|If you love brass bands, you will be taken in by con man Professor Harold Hill (Robert Preston).  Shirley Jones' early role is a charmer!  We need upbeat entertainment more than ever, <br />but do not often get it.  Everyone needs this \\"oldie\\" in their DVD collection.  Trouble in River City, but they get their 76 Trombones!
B000002NJS|5.0|With the 90s now rapidly becoming nostalgia's next target (see Rhino's new \\"Whatever\\" boxed set) it is time then to look back at the decade that took us from grunge to neo-punk. And most relevant \\"electronica\\" album, surprisingly is...Madonna!. Ray of light not only meant a change of musical direction, but probably a change of aim as well from the girl we now saw go from material to etherial in one single blow. In Ray of light madonna not only shows her stronger vocals yet, but for once targets our hearts and brains instead of our feet.
B00005QDW5|4.0|Ever since watching The Wall as a kid, I have been a big fan of Pink Floyd.  Even more so now with the release of this CD set.  From their beginnings with \\"See Emily Play\\" to their more recent \\"Keep Talking\\", this is a band that stands out.  The sound of their music is as timeless as they are.  I highly recommend Echoes as a perfect addition to any Pink Floyd collection.
B00005BIIP|5.0|If you have any opportunity of getting your hands on this CD, and you like Porcupine Tree at all, do not let that opportunity pass you by!  This CD is amazing. Sure, it's more/less a collection of b-sides, but it's still very fine material.<br /><br />I'll spare you a track-by-track rundown, but here are my favorite moments on the disc.  \\"Buying New Soul\\" is one of my all-time favorite songs.  Not just for a PT song, but just as a song in general.  It is slow and beautiful, and really captures Steven Wilson's opinion on the sense of isolation that fame can give someone.  \\"Cure for Optimisn\\" is another great mellow track (actually, this CD is mostly the softer side of Porcupine Tree, so don't expect any Deadwing-esque guitar riffs).  For anyone who has heard the Stupid Dream version of \\"Even Less\\", you have no idea what the Recordings version is like.  It is basically for the first 7 minutes, the same exact song as it is on SD, but after that, it morphs into this fabulous long instrumental.  You'll wonder why you ever thought the SD version sounded complete.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very introspective, laid-back, atmospheric, and tragically beautiful side of Porcupine Tree.  It's very similar to the softer side of Lightbulb Sun.  Think of the first half of \\"Russia on Ice\\" and you'll get what I mean.<br /><br />If you own this CD, as I do, consider yourself very lucky.  To those of you who don't, look for this anywhere you can, or try to convince Steven Wilson to reissue it, because it is amazing. Truly this is one of, if not THE, best b-side collection I have ever heard.
B000002LFL|5.0|By the time this came out, the Smiths had ended.  A recording from their aborted tour which the shocking news of the breakup was heard. Not the best of The Smiths live but an energetic album the same.  Worthwhile to the diehard Smiths fan and the new.
B000002B7U|4.0|Upon it's release, The Ultimate Sin was bashed unmercifully by even Ozzy's most dedicated fans, and I never understood why. I suppose the most commonly used words to describe this album were \\"slick\\" and \\"commercial.\\" Well, if every slick and commercial album rocked this hard and consistantly, I would be a happy camper. While it doesn't have the depth and impressive playing as Ozzy's finest work, this album is absolutely relentless if accepted as a bone cruching rock album. From beginning to end, it never lets up and the pacing of the songs are great. There really isn't a weak track on the entire album......and it just flows with rock abandonment. Ozzy was in a severely depressed mental slump during the making of this album, and considering that, it's amazing how fun and rocking it all turned out. I highly encourage  all fans to give it another try....accept it as a blazing, rock album, and they might be surprised.

Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours.

0385512104|5.0|I put this book down twice upon begining because I was affraid it was going to be one of those \\"Riding The Bus With My Sister\\" stories, completely sugary and hokey, a high school literature attempt of speaking as a type of person which one knows nothing about. As a sister of a person with autism, I thought I was going to be insulted, but all levels of autism are completely different. And I was really wanting to read something so I guess a thrid time was a charm.<br /><br /> A swirling, honest and gentle mind comes across a dog murdered in the night on one of his many wanderings through the neighborhood in the early morning hours. Fifteen year old Christophher John Francis Boone decides he is going to solve the mystery of poor Wellington that he himself is accused of murdering, as he prepares for his math exams.<br /><br /> Completely accurate and structured, we get to see inside the mind of Christopher through a book he is writing on his investigation and how the murder of the dog becomes connected to the mystery of the past two years of Christopher's life. Sometimes you want to reach into the pages and smack him and other times \\"stretch out your fingers\\" to him. The writing about on his first subway ride alone is completely descriptive and vivid. After a few chapters I was captivated by not only the character of Christopher but also the writing style.<br /><br /> This is one of those trips into a mind that make you laugh out loud much like some points in Catcher in The Rye. A very touching story.
B00005JNSK|4.0|Plot: Charlie is a boy who comes from a low-on-their-luck family. They haven't much of anything except each other. It is Charlie's birthday that will be soon arriving, and for his present he will get one Wonka Bar. But this year it will be different. Willy Wonka just so happens to be re-opening his factory, and five golden tickets are randomly placed in the most current production line of Wonka Bars. The five lucky children who find these tickets will receive a tour of Willy Wonka's Chocolate Factory for an entire day. And one extra-lucky child will receive a mystery prize at the end of the tour beyond their wildest imagination. Sure enough, Charlie ends up being one of those lucky children to enter the factory. So, along with four others, he meets Willy Wonka on that anticipated day and enters his palace-like factory, unaware of the absolutely amazing things he is about to see. And once those doors shut behind them, the magic begins. Room after room, we (the viewers) are treated to some truly colorful and imaginative sights. Along the way are the singing Oopma-Loompas, giant waterfalls of chocolate, edible grass and trees, kooky new inventions, and plenty more. Throughout the tour, however, each child's curiosity and spoiled nature brings about problems, and one by one they create their own catastrophes sure to end their visit! By the end of the film, of course, Charlie is the only one left and becomes the winner of the fantastic prize. But when the prize is revealed, the most important things in life are finally seen by Charlie as well as Willy Wonka, ultimately leading to a heart-warming ending that holds an important message for children and adults alike.<br /><br />Johnny Depp certainly makes a delightful Willy Wonka. Through the movie trailers, I thought Charlie And The Chocolate Factory would be a bit weirder and more twisted than it actually was. Regardless, you can be assured that Depp's portrayal of Wonka is no less than absolutely nutty! Depp's acting combined with the usual greatness of Tim Burton's peculiarly fascinating style (as well as some assistance from scorist Danny Elfman) is plenty of a reason to see this superb remake. This is a wonderful and amusing film for the entire family!th the usual greatness of Tim Burton's peculiarly fascinating style (as well as some assistance from scorist Danny Elfman) is plenty of a reason to see this superb remake.

The development of the plots to the twist about 2/3 rds through keep your own powers of deduction involved.

0765301598|1.0|This is a very contrived, unimaginative book. That's actually being mild and properly describes the first two books in this trilogy; this last book is just a total mess. <br /> <br />First, the notion that every societal theme in the classic novel Dune started at the same time is preposterous. That's not how social evolution works--it isn't so neat and tidy. <br /> <br />Second, the plot holes are enormous. As has been mentioned, the hero, Vorian Atreides is completely estranged from his sons yet somehow they carry on his name with pride along with his antipathy toward the Harkonnen. What's even more bizarre is it's only at the end of the book that Vorian adopts the hawk as his family symbol. But by that point, his descendents would easly be on their fourth or fifth generation and would number in the hundreds, if not thousands. Why would they adopt the symbol of a man who killed billions, even if against an equally deadly foe? <br /> <br />And why, when Paul experiences his visions of the past, he doesn't remember the wars that killed billions and his own ancestral involvement? Wouldn't this have made him quite likely to accept the Golden Path Leto II later embarks on? (It also makes what Leto II did look simply tame by comparison.) <br /> <br />The holes that really annoyed me, however, were about Omnius, the supposed genius thinking machine. Even with the folding ships, it still takes time to kill hundreds of planets and billions of people yet the main Omnius doesn't know about it? Exactly, what kind of idiotic system did he set up? Well, one that only a rather dense writer could invent. Here's the killer part; we have more fault tolerant computer systems today than Omnius. (We even have what are called rad-hardened chips which aren't susceptible to EM pulse.) <br /> <br />The dumbest single thing, though, is what Omnius does once surrounded. He creates little robot destroyers straight out of the B movie Runaway. The smarter move would be to build robots with discrete circuits to A) manufacture new gel circuit brains and B) the knowledge to plant in those brains. At the very least, they would be smart enough to attack the shield around Corrin, rather than waste time killing people on distant worlds. <br /> <br />Finally, the chapters on Arrakis make no sense and apparently exist solely to offer some connection to Dune. <br /> <br />Do yourself a favor and skip this book. I'd even go so far as to suggest skipping all the books outside the original trilogy. But, if you haven't read any of them, at the very least read the original Dune--it is a true masterpiece. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

This is a fantastic film about love and true devotion. It is rare for me to get emotionally involved in a film, and this film definately brought that out of me, crying most of the way through. For more than one reason. The passion and love is literally felt when watching this film.

I mean it is only a DVD just like every other one that are all cheaper for one movie.

Spencer`s sweeping beliefs, intended to inform the innate, include red-hot issues such as: how the \\"Golden Age\\" was inspired by non-muslims,  why Muhammed was a dangerous role model, and the \\"stifling\\" effect Islam has on scientific theory.  The book exposes how Spencer believes, it is a measure of restraint with which American leaders do their job that he thinks attempting to win the \\" Hearts and Minds \\" of citizens is outrageously naive.  The author`s devastating outbursts at Muhammed is likely to rekindle an awful amount of fury, and lifts the lid on how a truly apalling vista will open before us.  The whitewashed Islam that is presented, he suspects, undermines America`s ability to defend against terrorism.  He considers America need to make that extra effort to put a stop to a cycle of bloodshed.  That the West are so dangerously exposed comes as noteworthy information to a nation so reluctant to scorch their culture, according to Spencer.  Indeed, he talks freely of civilisation, but his remarks have already been greeted by mass outrage, thus sparking intense public interest.  I particularly recommend this book to newcomers of Politics!
B000819PKC|5.0|I've been waiting for Jamiroquai to launch a good album similar to Travelling Without Moving and A Funk Odyssey.  This album is amazing.  Many of the tunes have a disco beat and there aren't as many slow songs as Synkronized had.  If your a fan, I would definitly recommend this CD.

The ambitions and power of a passed over chief whip whose wherewithall to inspire mischief, is unmatched, provides the backdrop for this witty often hilarious and always edgy tale of the man who would be prime minister. It's possible that I was just disappointed that it was coming to an end, but I found the last of the four hour-long sections, Final Cut, a bit lacking. Still. I've watched it three times in a year and given it for presents twice. I highly recomend House of Cards.
B000000OF6|5.0|Queen is, without question, one of the greatest rock bands of all time. With their incomparable lead singer Freddie Mercury and their canon of some of the greatest songs ever to hit the airwaves, Queen are legends. And of course, with most legendary bands, they have several greatest hits collection out on the market for casual fans. In 1995, Hollywood Records released the two disc collection \\"Queen - Greatest Hits Vols. 1 & 2\\". It contains 34 tracks, is digitally remastered and has most of their hits. How does it hold up? Read on for the positives and negatives.<br /><br />Positives:<br />-If you're a casual Queen fan who is only interesting owning their biggest hits, than this is an almost ideal collection, as you will find \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\", \\"Somebody To Love\\", \\"We Are The Champions\\", \\"Another One Bites The Dust\\" and all the other classic Queen hits.<br />-You will also get a lot of rarely heard tracks such as \\"Seven Seas Of Rhye\\", \\"Don't Stop Me Now\\", \\"Now I'm Here\\", \\"Save Me\\", and \\"Good Old Fashioned Lover Boy\\".<br />-Disc two contains a lot of excellent European hits that the North American audiences might not be familliar with, such as \\"Radio Ga Ga\\", \\"I Want It All\\", \\"The Show Must Go On\\", \\"I Want To Break Free\\", \\"I'm Going Slightly Mad\\" and \\"Who Wants To Live Forever\\".<br />-The liner notes are excellent.<br />-All of the songs sound absolutely fantastic.<br />-It's relatively cheap and easy to find.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />-The first disc does not fill the eighty minute time limit, clocking in at a mere 58:29. That means there was enough room to include \\"Tie Your Mother Down\\", \\"Keep Yourself Alive\\", \\"Stone Cold Crazy\\" and possibly \\"Body Language\\".<br />-If I'm not mistaken, \\"Bicycle Race\\" is edited.<br />-Disc two failed to include what might be my favorite Queen song ever, \\"These Are The Days Of Our Lives\\". I would've knocked off \\"One Vision\\" to include that song.<br />-Hollywood Records also has two single disc Queen collections out on the market, \\"Classic Queen\\" and \\"Greatest Hits\\". On their own, they don't really stand their ground, as both are missing a great many Queen classics. But when purchased together, you could not ask for a more comprehensive Queen collection, as they are even better than this collection.

B000024D4R|5.0|I'd rather not review an album that my prose is unjustified in raving.  However, I am compelled to encourage those who believe they have exhausted the sonic fringe, yet have not discovered 'Animals', to get this album, put their headphones on, and milk it.  Although many consider this a 'stripped down' work from Pink Floyd, the music on Animals maintains their characteristic sound from 'Dark Side of the Moon', 'Wish You Were Here', etc.  The central three songs are epic and each incorporate guitar-keyboard interaction in a distinct way from PF's other albums.  If you like rhodes keyboards, you will also like this album.  In keeping terse, I suggest you get this album and hear Pink Floyd's greatest masterpiece yourself.
B0000542D2|5.0|I know a lot of people are saying that the quality of things on this DVD are very bad compared to other versions. But I've never seen another version, and if you haven't either than it won't make a difference to you. <br /> <br />This movie is just terrific. The Fab Four seem to really be enjoying themselves. It's a hilarious movie, with Paul's grandfather and John making most of the laughs. The performances of songs are very good. It's a great movie, and it actually has a plot (unlike Magical Mystery Tour). <br /> <br />This film is a must for any Beatles fan, buy it now!!!
0778321606|4.0|This was the first book by Debbie Macomber that I've read and I enjoyed it.  I had it finished in two days and plan on starting the sequel, A Good Yarn. <br /> <br />The story begins with Lydia, a two-time cancer survivor who decides to open a yarn store and offer knitting classes.  Because of the class, she meets Jacqueline, Alix and Carol. <br /> <br />Lydia is just trying to get through each day and finds her store a comfort.  After battling a brain tumor for the second time, she just wants her life back and some normalcy.  She has a strained relationship with her sister, Margaret, who always felt she was cheated out of her parent's attention because of the time they spent with Lydia while she was sick.  During the story, Margaret has her own cancer scare, and begins to see and understand what Lydia has been dealing with since she was 16.  Because of this, they are able to repair their relationship. <br /> <br />Jacqueline is the wife of a contractor and belongs to the country club.  She is upset because she feels her only child, Paul, has married beneath him.  Tammie Lee is from the south and everything she says and does grates on Jacqueline.  Then she finds out Tammie Lee is pregnant and thinks it's just to keep her son.  Her relationship with her husband is non-existent.  She's very judgmental and opinionated.  She joins Lydia's knitting class to make a baby blanket for her grandchild. <br /> <br />Carol is trying to get pregnant.  She has run out of chances and desperately wants a baby.  When she sees Lydia offering the class on baby blankets, she sees it as a sign that she will have a child. <br /> <br />Alix is from a troubled home.  She doesn't have any contact with her father and her mother is in jail.  It's hard for her to let anyone get close to her.  Her goal is to attend cooking school and someday have her own catering business.  She runs into a childhood friend, Jordan, and cautiously begins a relationship with him. <br /> <br />Joining this class changes the lives of all the women.  When these women meet for the first time, it's hard to see how they will become friends, but they do.  It's wonderful to see how they learn to trust and turn to each other.  Over time, Jacqueline realizes that Tammie Lee isn't so bad and she befriends Alix. It's nice to see Lydia and Margaret get along.  Lydia begins to see her UPS delivery man. <br /> <br />The story is realistic and interesting.  I had a hard time putting it down.  If all of Debbie Macomber's books are this good, I've found myself a new author to enjoy!  I highly recommend this one to anyone.
B0009Q0F5U|5.0|I am an avid collector of movie and TV soundtracks, I have to say, this is one of the best ever I have bought.  The music is moving, deep and often quite thought provoking.  This is especially so if you have seen the show. <br /> <br />If you are a fan of the series then I strongly suggest you buy this soundtrack.  Tracks 24 and 27 are my favourate from Kobol's last gleaming.
B000002H2H|5.0|This cd is a step up production, vocal, and music wise from Kill 'Em All. It is the definition of speed metal and deserves a spot on your cd shelf. The solos are crazy, the wa-wa pedal gets a workout and the lyrics are incredible! The four best songs on the cd would have to be Ride the Lightning, For Whom the Bells Toll, Fade to Black, and Fight Fire With Fire. The other four come very close though. The call of ktulu is metallica's best instrumental and would be a great outro for a superhero movie! Creeping Death has awesome riffs and has that Egyptian feel to it. Escape is probably the worst song on the cd. It just doesnt have that metallcia feel to it. Just a heavy song. Fade to Black is one of metallicas best slower songs and has outstanding guitar parts and solos. For whom the bells toll is heavy and probably the best song, lyrically on the cd. Ride the Lightning is the best song on the cd being fast heavy and a great song to pump you up. Fight Fire with fire is very syncopated and short and to the point. Great drum fills and helicopter bass parts, a sure hit!<br /><br />p.s. i did have a better review than this but i hit a wrong button and it got erased. A Great cd and one to get for sure!!!

B000A2RRF4|3.0|Now that the court case is over, can we get back to the music?  You might well ask.  However, truth is, in Michael's case, it has never JUST been about the music.  That's why he was/is(?) a superstar.  Much of it is about his charisma, his image (not really the same thing),eccentricities both endearing and off-putting, as well as the music.  You either bought the package or you didn't.    I didn't, actually, which is not to say that I did not recognize Jackson's talent as a singer, dancer and songwriter.  But the last thing I ever bought of his was THRILLER--and then mainly for one song, namely, \\"Beat It.\\"  Yes, the song that impressed me the most was likely the rockiest thing he's ever done.  I liked the sinuous \\"Billie Jean\\" well enough and the title track was pretty good, but eventually anything with voiceover narration is going to get on my nerves (even if it IS Vincent Price: come to think of it, ESPECIALLY if it's Vincent Price).  But \\"Beat It\\" really got to the heart of this old rock'n'roller.    What came later didn't particularly move me.  Much of the rest of the 80s and 90s product seemed to be a lot less compelling.  Loads of funk riffs with Jackson singing \\"Come on, girl\\" and \\"whee hee\\" on top of it.  OK, but nothing that would really grab you.  Maybe all the crotch grabbing was his way of compensating for the fact the music itself was getting less and less grabbing.    But this filmed concert in Bucharest is interesting.  Agoraphobe that I am, there is absolutely no way I would ever attend a Jackson concert in person (unless his popularity plummets to the point where he starts playing small clubs or something).  So this was as close as I was ever going to get.  And it was fascinating to watch--especially from a sort of antrhopological perspective.  The cameras are constantly panning to the frenzied audience.  There are more crowd shots here than in any concert video or film I've ever seen.  I suppose this is meant to convey the excitement of an actual MJ concert.  (And one has to acknowledge the significance of a big American-style extravaganza in a post-Cold War, former Soviet Bloc country.  That could only have added to the frenzied excitement.)    But frankly, I find it all just a little hard to relate to.  Makes me remember how even when I was a little kid, I didn't understand all those girls screaming at the Beatles.  I wanted to listen to the MUSIC, thank you very much.  Not have some hysteric screaming in my ear.  I guess I'd have to say that the whole superstar trip is pretty much lost on me.  And I'm just as glad.    Which is not to say I don't believe Michael Jackson is talented, maybe even a genius of his genre.  But I found it disturbing almost that even during some of the ballads he felt compelled to keep on with the robo-dance moves, just a little more slo-mo.  Why can't he just stand there and sing, I wondered.  Then it dawned on me.  Well, this concert wasn't meant for viewers (and listeners) like me.  I guess the human race will always demand a certain amount of spectacle, and that's fine, I suppose.   That's show biz--and it can even be art.  If there's steak to go along with the sizzle, that's fine.  With Michael Jackson, even circa 1995, it was about 50/50 in the steak to sizzle ratio, though.    What it would be today only Jehovah knows.

B00064AM6C|4.0|The White Stripes are a group that prides themselves on cut and dry simplicity, allowing their music to speak for each album and video release.  Their latest release, Under The Blackpool Lights is no exception.  In an age where most musicians will drop hundreds of thousands of dollars for the latest and greatest in digital recording, the Stripes go against the grain, filming on old-style 8mm reels and using nothing but prehistoric analog equipment. <br /> <br />Surprisingly, the DVD is very well mixed and the sound quality has suffered not a bit.  Jack White's performance is energetic, motivated, and most importantly; competant.  A lot of groups who release DVD live shows fail to grasp the concept of playing for the camera.  The White Stripes pull it off not just acceptably, but skillfully.  <br /> <br />As for the visual aesthetics, don't expect a lot.  The entire concert is washed by their trademark blood red, white and black colors.  All in all living up to the legacy the peppermint duo have carved for themselves in the Alternative Rock scene.  <br /> <br />If you have any appreciation for the days when blues and rock were about so much more than aggression, death and drugs give this DVD a chance.  It just may revive the foot-thumpin, head bobbing, sing-alone side of you that you thought was long dead and buried.
068485743X|1.0|When I began to read, I felt I was holding a rocket in a small tome. The writer launches with the words, \\"Most people are against books on writing on principle. So am I.\\" My very own thoughts! So I kept reading, engrossed by the concise cadence of the words of guidance.  <br /> <br />But on page 58, cold regret began washing in. Sure, his advice on that page is quite sound (e.g. \\"instead of saying `birds flew overhead,' name the birds.\\") His point: being specific will also make readers feel \\"they're learning something new, be it the name of a bird, bug or tree they've never heard of before.\\" Lukeman's next sentence says (and I agree): \\"We must remember that reading is as much about education as it is entertainment.\\"  <br /> <br />A necessary digression: In the late 90s, here in Australia, one Matthew Reilly, Law student, produced a book, \\"Ice Station\\", which led him to his present status as \\"millionaire many times over.\\" (Those are words of Reilly's schoolmate who I met at a jobsite months ago.) <br /> <br />\\"Ice Station\\" is the personification of a book that brought its writer fortune and fame.  \\"Ice Station\\" is also the personification of a book that ignores guideposts in books like this. (Check the reviews of \\"Ice Station\\" by Matthew Reilly, noting especially the ones that speak plainly of this book's disregard for technical accuracy.)  <br /> <br />This review (please note) is not to needlessly hogwash \\"First Five Pages\\"; nor is it to tear down Mr Reilly's work; nor to senselessly darken the outlook for writers-to-be. As will be clear by review-end, it is to lay bare a side of publishing that is hidden. Or unfathomable. In short, this review is to attempt a REALISTIC picture of the odds that aiming writers must brace themselves for. <br /> <br />After hearing a warm and fuzzy radio talk of how Matt Reilly finally got his book published and \\"best-sellerized\\", I bought a copy. Boy, was it hard to get through! I quickly realized that the \\"fuzzy\\" aspect of Reilly'ssuccess report was fuzzy in another way: \\"fuzzy\\" with facts.  Oh well, that's journalism for you, I thought as I continued in my quest to crack the code for publishing success. I bought the audio book. Listening instead of eye-straining would make it easy to force-feed my brain, I thought. I thought wrong. The narration sounded clumsy---all round, it sounded ATROCIOUS. I had the feeling throughout, that the narrator seemed ill at ease putting his professional voice to such a silly job.  <br /> <br />And to think!---the story surrounding Matt Reilly and his writerly quest had sounded so enticing on our trusted, no-advertising radio station (Radio National). How could they have put out such claptrap? Did our Radio National not consider the possibility that they'd lose credibility among their listeners?  <br /> <br />One of the most useful things I got out of my training in Science was \\"clear thought\\"; to know that if a single occurrence contradicts the established laws of a science, the validity of that entire science can come crashing down. The case of Mr Reilly's unmeritorious success makes many books like \\"First Five\\" speed groundward at 10m/s2. They induce a disquieting mood that something vital is missing. Those who possess the secrets of publishing success are unable, or unwilling, to give a full explanation as to how it is that writers of great skill are ignored, and the bookshops are full of rubbish. Wait! \\"Rubbish\\" is subjective. Please check for yourself, review reader, and find out how many published writers trail along the guidelines of writing coaches and their books. Like the man who got rich solely from writing a book on how to get rich, some are getting published by writing books on how to get published. Oh, you want proof? Do I have enough space here? If you've read this far, you're determined. You'll do your own research. I hope you'll see the lay of the land more clearly than I can; I hope what you see will be brighter than what I see. One title ofpublishing success merely from writing a book on publishing success comes to mind.  Before mentioning her, I should say that she wrote her book out of an honest navet---NOT with a charlatan's hand. The book is \\"Writing Down the Bones\\"; her name, Natalie Goldberg.  <br /> <br />Would it be useful to mention--according to Mr Reilly's schoolmate--that Reilly's school was a wealthy private school; that Reilly's uncle is a barrister; that he is in fact well-connected? I remember the year Reilly made his dbut.  Major bookshops in Sydney made mini towers of \\"Ice Station\\" to greet customers. From that year on, I have refused to buy a single book from those bookstores. I often browse in those bookstores (good service since Amazon.com became a competitor), but do I actually buy books from them? I prefer Amazon, thanks very much. A cynical attitude? Well, who started it?  <br /> <br />To add the cherry to this dark view so plain to the sharp- and clear-eyed, here's an anecdote that begins chapter 16: \\"In 1969, `Steps', a novel by [...] won the National Book Award. Six years later, a freelance writer named `Chuck Ross', to test the old theory that a novel by an unknown writer doesn't have a chance, typed the first 21 pages of `Steps' and sent them out to four publishers as the work of `Eric Demos'. All four rejected the manuscript. Two years after that, he typed out the whole book, and sent it again, credited to `Eric Demos', to more publishers, including the original publisher of the [prize-winning] book, Random House. Again all rejected it with unhelpful comments. Random House used a form letter. Altogether, 14 publishers and 13 literary agents failed to recognize a book that had already been published, and had won an important literary prize.\\"  <br /> <br />How are even the most talented among us ever going to see the light of publication?  A rejection slip will merely deject us into a despair that we're not talented after all. (Personally, I don't care to get published---I DO care about life's necessities that publication can buy.) <br /> <br />I get the feeling that we, Writers-without-influential-connections, will need as much luck as a lotto ticket buyer. Oh well, we can dream! I fear that's what we'll ever get to do. We'll no doubt enjoy a life of shunning other work in our love for writing, with little hope that our labours will ever see the light of any spotlight. Until some worldly soul gives us advice that doesn't take us along years of honing our craft, only to leave us at a brink, and no bridge in sight.  <br /> <br />But wait! For those worthy writers among us, I DID find ONE writing book whose song chimed honest and bright: STEPHEN KING ON WRITING! (ISBN0340769963) Cracking that book open on page 109, you get the feeling he doesn't do any salsas around the truth. There are bad writers a-plenty, he says, employed as \\"professionals\\"; others have scribbled their crap to \\"homes in the Caribbean.\\"  Genius writers, he goes on to say, are mental equivalents of runway models thrown forth by genetic dice. At any rate, here's the core of what he works up to: \\"it is impossible to make a competent writer out of a bad writer\\" and \\"it is equally impossible to make a great writer out of a good one.\\" And here is another of King's guiding sentences: \\"I'm afraid this idea is rejected by lots of critics and PLENTY OF WRITING TEACHERS, as well.\\" (Caps are my own.) <br /> <br />Bottom line: Not everyone can be a runway model---not everyone can be Writer. Those who offer their services as writing coaches---through books or otherwise---do it for dollars and cents.  But they make little sense. Those bad writers who \\"connect\\" their way into publication midget-ize a nation's literary treasure.  <br /> <br />My one grump about \\"On Writing\\" is that it says nothing about the \\"networking\\" side of publishing success.  <br /> <br />I wonder. Has Mr Reilly made Australia a laughing stock? Is everyone too polite to laugh?  <br /> <br />May the powers-that-be put a-right all that is wrong. May bad writers find their true calling, instead of causing grief and wasted of lives all round.
0385338686|5.0|I was magnetically drawn to this book yesterday at the bookstore - mostly because I too am an Undomestic Goddess.  After reading the first few pages and laughing aloud I had to buy it.  I'm not a \\"chiklit\\" fan at all but I enjoyed this book immensely!  It made me laugh and it made me cry and I could totally relate to her family situation.  I haven't finished it yet (halfway through) but I loved it so much I wanted to post a review.  A definate buy!
B000006E4C|5.0|The worst question you could ever ask a music fan, one who is always searching for something more to broaden their sense of what drives this passion for music, is what their favorite album or piece of music.<br /><br />Now I'm a fan of folk, indie rock, some hip-hop, country, choral music, hardcore, and other classical artists, but it wasn't until I heard 'Music For 18 Musicians' during my sophomore year in college during a semester abroad in Oxford, England that I could settle on one album for that top spot. No more sifting through Kid A, Pet Sounds, Rites Of Spring, or Heartbreaker...No this was the mathematically perfect piece of music that you've been looking for all your life.<br /><br />I originally heard the ECM recording (only through the first 5 chords) and normally the first version I hear tends to be my favorite, but the Nonesuch recording is so rich, longer, better recorded, and it's divided into separate tracks as everyone has already pointed out.<br /><br />The way '18' weaves in and out of it's chords is not an ambient minimalist piece that you can enjoy as mere background music like an Eno record but this is more for concentrated listens. Not to say that it can't be enjoyed in the passive form, but I definitely get more from the concentrated full-run sessions.<br /><br />Beware though; this piece can often turn you against all other music for long periods of time. Also it made me realize I would never be a musician. You'll just want to write something this perfect, and I knew that I couldn't. My talents lie elsewhere.

B0001NBMBC|1.0|\\"Forget everything you know.  Slipknot is reborn...\\"  That was the slogan for months before Vol. 3 came out.  Well, Slipknot certainly was reborn... and how unneccessary and heartbreaking such a change was.  If this album was by another band, I would very much like it.  But on Slipknot standards, it is very poor and very sad.  I know for a fact I am not the only that feels (as much as it would seem like blasphemy) that Slipknot has indeed sold out.  More and more reasons keep popping up.  First was the COMPLETE conversion to soft metal.  Now I know some bands change and soften over the years, but never this much without an ulterior motive ($$).  Next is the TOTAL lack of cussing in this album.  I'm not stupid, and in no way do I feel that there needs to be swearing on an album for it to be good... but this is Slipknot we're talking about.  Go watch the Disasterpieces DVD; Corey cannot go more than two words without cussing, it's in his blood.  The past two albums were incredibly saturated in vulgarity.  Why clean it up?  To prove that swearing isn't needed to make good songs, Corey claims.  To make their music more accessible to a wider age group in order to sell more copies, I say (not to mention the absolute toning down of Corey's scream; in fact, he doesn't really scream at all on this album, just sounds like he's strainging his voice).  Then they go and make a single of \\"Before I Forget\\", the most annoying and emo-esque of ALL Slipknot songs.  Oh and wouldn't ya know it, emo just happens to be quite popular at the moment.  Next, they make a music video for the song, and guess what?  No masks!  This is the same band that swore they'd never be seen without their masks, that in fact their masks were their true musical identities.  The removal of their masks only confirms the removal of their true musical selves.  Getting the picture yet?  Well if all that is not enough, know also that they have recently opened up their own line of (no joke) Slipknot footwear and skatewear... wow... Oh yeah, they're also selling replicas of their masks now, 'cause you know, they were hurting for money...  Slipknot was my favorite band for a long time.  I was 100% OBSESSED.  I'm no sicko or anything, but I loved them when they were brutal, disturbing, vulgar, and (as they dubbed themselves with the first song on their first CD) Sic... they don't even where jumpsuits anymore... now they've got stylish Slipknot t-shirts as their stagewear.  And guess what else, Corey did vocals on a song on the upcoming Roadrunner Records 25th Anniversary Album, and what a surprise, the song is called \\"The Rich Man\\", what a shocker.  Be warned, they really have changed.  If you loved Sliknot and Iowa, this CD isn't for you.  You'd probably much more enjoy Chimaira or Soulfly, even Korn's new CD is heavier than this latest effort by Slipknot.  Vol.3 is no more than Stone Sour with better drumming.  So much for \\"I'm a pop star threat and I'm not dead yet\\", \\"people = sh*t\\", and \\"F*** everything that you stand for\\"... now it's \\"I am a world before I am a man\\", \\"if I lose, at least I tried\\" and \\"she's the only one that makes me sad\\".  They sure changed alright.    I'm telling you, crank up \\"People = Sh*t\\" on your loudest, bassiest system and after only the 1st minute, ask yourself, \\"What happened to this band?\\"
B00062ZE3U|5.0|For those who compare this CD to Evanescence's Fallen, I must say they're out of their minds. TSF is a much better album, it has a better concept and the songs kick every song from Fallen. There are some WT fans who think they sold out by releasing this CD, I disagree with them as well. TSF is just another step in WT's career. Something that I love about bands is the way some of them do different things with each album they release, Garbage is an example, all their albums sound different, and the best example of different sounds is the fantastic PJ Harvey, so Within Temptation are a case like those I mentioned before, since Enter, their sound has changed a lot. Enter was like the doomed album, then Mother Earth was more medieval like and TSF is like a dark piece of art. Even the commercial Stand My Ground sounds good, the music for that song is great, and even better is the music in Jillian, Memories (which absolutely touches everybody's souls), Angels (a song about revenge, perfect for those who feel angry), Aquarius (about an obsessive love) and See Who I Am, the great song that opens the album. Do not pay attention to reviews that compare this CD with any other band, it's not like anything else that's been done before. Within Temptation has a unique sound, and they can easily use their music to take you to magical places. Buy this album along with first 2 WT's cd's, I swear you won't regret it.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|One of System of A Down's finest albums, kinda reminds me a bit of there first album, however shows they they can grow as a band also, i enjoyed this album, id have to say if your a system fan, this is the album for you, based on what ive heard on this entire album, i cant say its the best ive heard from System Of A Down, but its damn close, but ill give it sometime to grow on me a bit more.
B000002KIK|5.0|1978's Never Say Die was Black Sabbath's final album with Ozzy at the helm. Now, many people are putting this album down, but I put this as second (only to Sabbath Bloody Sabbath, Paranoid being third). Why? Because it has a good range of songs. This one is their jazziest album (Breakout is the best example). This is the last hurrah with Ozzy at the helm, and lets take a look: <br /> <br />1)Never Say Die [3:50] - This is the Thin Lizzy-esque title track. And it is the best opener of all the albums (except for Sabbath Bloody Sabbath). It's a very fast pace rocker, and the solo at the end is a real shocker. It's the 2nd best song on the album. [5/5+] <br /> <br />2)Johnny Blade [6:29] - Tied with Junior's Eyes for 3rd favourite. The organs at the start (and throughout the entire song) are really great. And Ozzy really shines on this one. But the real amazement, is Mr. Tony Iommi's GODLY guitar solo at the end. This song is definitely one of Black Sabbath's best songs. [5/5] <br /> <br />3)Junior's Eyes [6:43] - Like I said, tied with JB for 3rd best. This is a slow, semi-sad song. About the death of Ozzy's father, and this is a great song to honour him. The vocals are top-notch again, the guitars are great. Geezer's bass is on par with N.I.B. on this song. I just LOVE the chorus. It's an AWESOME song. [5/5] <br /> <br />4)A Hard Road [6:05] - After the great 3, comes another good song. A catchy tune, and the guitar is great. The chorus is very good. And I believe that at the end of the song, the others actually SING backup with Ozzy. Very different from the other songs. [4/5+] <br /> <br />5)Shock Wave [5:15] - THIS is the best song on the album. About cryogenics, and the riffs are excellent. The rhythm is top-notch. The chorus is the best part of the song. The solo kicks ass as well. Just about everything on this song is fantastic. [6/5] <br /> <br />6)Air Dance [5:13] - A bit too soft for my taste. The beginning is good, but the rest is just soft piano. It's actually my least favourite song on the album (Well, 3rd least favourite, Breakout and Swinging The Chain take 1st and 2nd). But only but a slight hair. They're all just bunched together as a whole lot of great songs. The middle part is the best part of the song, where the piano speeds up and the rock comes back. And even NSD's weakest are heavier than Technical Ecstasy's strongest. [4/5] <br /> <br />7)Over To You [5:23] - I'm just stumped. Why do people put this song down so much? It has a very good tune, and the chorus is great. Ozzy's vocals are amazing. I like this song. [4/5] <br /> <br />8)Breakout [Instrumental] [2:35] - The jazziest instrumental yet. The saxophone is a part of this instrumental. This is a true example of a band that never was afraid to experiment. This is the most creative instrumental of them all. But I'd still choose Fluff. However, it's very good as an intro to STC. [3/5+] <br /> <br />9)Swinging The Chain [4:05] - Bill Ward, again, take the stage and takes lead vocals. It's actually better than It's Alright. There's also another thing that's back from another album. It's the harmonica (from The Wizard). Ozzy takes harmonica to finish off the album. In my opinion though, they should've put Over To You as the last track, it would make more sense (Since it's Ozzy's final album with Black Sabbath). But it's not that much of a deal. A great end, to an epic album. [4/5+] <br /> <br />And that is the end of Ozzy's run as singer of Black Sabbath. Black Sabbath would go on with Ronnie James Dio. And to say it now and get it over with: <br /> <br />Ozzy is better than Dio as a Black Sabbath singer, only by a slight hair though. That's just the truth. <br /> <br />Well, now that that's over. I recommend this album to everybody, but check Paranoid out first, then the rest. Well, I'm done. I've got to head over to do my Heaven and Hell review.
0765310015|4.0|This book is equally as big in scope as Martin's Song of Ice and Fire series, and almost as good. While Erikson doesn't seem to explore his characters quite as much as Martin, but he still does a good job of giving his characters backstories and conflicts of emotions.  <br /> <br />(It's def. a fault of mine that I compare this with Martin, but others have done it too) <br /> <br />After reading this I felt as though I needed a scorecard to keep track of all the players in the book (thank you Erikson for the Dramatis Personae in the book's opening), and I found this frustrating at first. But then I realized that it was Erickson's superior writing that kept me in the dark about the true nature of most of the characters. Much in the same way as Martin, Erikson weaves his story in such a way that the reader usually only has a faint idea of what's about to happen. And instead of taking large amounts of time to merely describe people and personalities, he works them into the story through their actions and interactions (which is what a good writer does anyway). <br /> <br />The other thing I was supremely impressed with was the use of magic and the role of the Gods in this novel. Magic was present and useful, but not the be-all-end-all of power. Common people had the ability to counteract magical powers, thus limiting its use (but believe me, it does have its uses). Also, as opposed to many of the Greek gods and such who have absolute power, Erikson's gods are still bound by rules and can be brough down the same as mortals, thus they have a great deal of power, but still take a gamble when meddling in moral affiars.  <br /> <br />At the end of this book I didn't feel the strong connections that I felt after reading Martin's novels, but the plot was just as good and just as intricate. A very good book with rich culture, history and background. A must-read in my book.

B0006L5RT2|5.0|The surprise sleeper hit CD of the year that managed to keep Coldplay off the top of the UK albums chart.<br /><br />James Blunt is the British former Sgt Major turned singer and his debut is really very good.<br /><br />His style is more like delicate lilting folk/pop/rock, and his androgynous sounding soulful voice just take the songs to another level. Right from the retro look of the CD photo, to the 70s sound, a wonderful CD indeed!<br /><br />Standout track in my opinion, and a UK no.1 is `You're beautiful', a stunningly beautiful ballad sung in an emotion laden voice about a love that can never be. A song about seeing and falling in love with a beautiful girl on a crowded train, whom he will never see again. 'But it's time to face the truth/I can never be with you' he sings.<br /><br />Other highlights are the poignant piano/synth string laden 'Goodbye my lover' ('I'm so hollow baby'- simply outstanding!!), `High', `Cry', upping the tempo a bit, `Billy', 'Out of my mind' and `So long Jimmy' (reminding me of Chris Rea), and 'No bravery', a lament like song with lyrics about war drawn no doubt from his spell in the army. And there's the tender, beautiful 'Wisemen' with an excellent guitar break.<br /><br />Delicate, timeless sounding songs, with wonderful storytelling lyrics. One of the best releases of this year. Just gets better with each play.
0394873742|5.0|I purchased this book for my grandson after we discovered it in our local library.  Every time we read it, we discover something new we haven't seen before.  He absolutely loves it and so do I.  It's a great and unusual gift.
B000022TSH|5.0|This film sums up what film noir is all about. Style and form takes your eye and misleads you into thinking you know what's going on. Nicholson's Gittes character is fantastic - sure he plays the tough hard boiled PI but when it boils down to it - he is caught in a game far far greater than he can understand and the reality of the stakes involved only dawn on him at the very end. John Huston gives a lesson in how to be evil - that is you never show it on the surface. And Polanski's direction is as good as anyone in the history of cinema - his composition, his attention to detail and knowledge of how each character would play out the story. <br /> <br />this is what great cinema is all about
0060934913|5.0|I listened to this book after buying it from audible_com, read out loud by Bourdain. In its very first paragraphs Bourdain forcefully states his likes and dislikes - 'I despise vegetarians'. Well, i am a vegetarian, a fish-eating variety, sorry for the animals whose bones are reduced to glaze (if i spell it correctly) for his various dishes. Never mind the gore - what i felt reading or rather listening to his book - was a sense that there was an honest voice, not pretending to be something he is not, clear and strong, warts, drugs, and all.  The sense of toughness - do what needs to be done, do not fret about the consequences.  As I listened to this book, swinging my car through the curves, was The Old Man and the Sea - not that Bourdain is a Hemingway, but his masculine 'nose to the grindstone' attitude and sensibility. There is a job to be done, people who depend you, and you'll do what needs to be done, even if sharks eat your catch.  Bourdain is profane, funny, engaging - as many reviewers had pointed out and a few constipated prudes got offended by - but it is a great autobiography of a man. i thought of my favorite - The Making of a Country Lawyer by Gerry Spence and if you want to look further back the biography of Sam Johnson by Boswell and Boswell's own autobiography of sorts - just a great, great read of what a man's life feels from the inside. Thank you, Tony - and I'll leave the expletives out.<br /><br />Alex Elder, Straying from the Flock
0385512104|4.0|I don't want to generalize too much, but to me, this book is just about as endearing as the movie Rain Man.  Imagine all the pain associated with a divorce, and then try to imagine that from a teenaged autistic perspective!  Complex though this may be, the author pulled it off nicely, and with a good bit of humor sprinkled in to carry us through the hard times.  Some of the negative reviews on here are both comical and annoying...like the people who say the book is too easy to read, or they don't like the run-on sentences and math problems...and one even admitted that even if a person with autism/Asperger's would think that way, they could care less.  Clearly they're the wrong readers for this book and probably shouldn't even be posting a review if they don't want some depth in their reading to begin with!
B000A88F22|5.0|I thought this show was actually pretty interesting, raw and entertaining You rarely get a view into a celebrities REAL life. Most of the time, it seems like they are trying to put on a show in front of the cameras. Since Britney and Kevin shot this one themselves, it had a genuine trueness to it. No matter what the media and others say about Britney, I think she has a good head on her shoulders and she has a GREAT support system. She's just a girl who likes to have fun and be in love! I definately recommend this DVD and CD if you want a REAL view into the life of a celebrity without all the smoke and mirrors!!!
B00005JLRT|4.0|Nemisis was adventurous.  The story line would get slightly close to the edge of allowing the viewer to figure out what was actually going on but then, another turn in the plot would take the story to a different direction; ensuring that the viewer wouldn't figure it out until the director was ready for it to happen. <br /> <br />The whole \\"dune buggy\\" scene was cool as it allowed the Captain to have what I call -- \\"a Kirk moment\\" which I thought was due for the Captain. <br /> <br />The whole ramming scene was too way cool for words....... it's just something you quite don't seen in a space adventure.
0142001104|5.0|Excellent book, it follows with a great development, the stories are fabulous and real, and at the end your are full of energy.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|Firefly is some of the best work I have seen from Joss Whedon.  And that is saying a lot, considering he also created Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Angel. <br /> <br />Even if you don't like Buffy & Angel, give Firefly a shot.  You won't be dissappointed.
068987474X|3.0|What I had hoped would offer never before revealed secrets about the opposite sex, turned out to be what I knew all along; people are ultimately where they want to be, and if someone wants to talk to you they'll call. This book got a lot of hype that frankly, I feel is undeserved. Women will little to no common sense will find it very revealing, for the rest of us it will be light reading that elicits a yawn or two.
B00005JMAH|5.0|As a fan of the movie it would be hard not to give this DVD set a good rating. However, I felt that the performace of the special qualities on these discs were fun and easily accessible. Like the DVD's previous to this one, the special features section is glittered with Harry Potter-ish designs to keep the viewer entertained and delighted at the feel of being apart of the movie. Unlike it's predecessors, to access the special features you don't have to go through non-sense games that make you feel embarassed that you are actually doing this if you are above the age of 7. There are good interviews with the cast (although the talking head was more of a moment killer than comical relief), a great interview with J.K. Rowling and Alfonso Cuarn for fans of the book series, and fun interactive tours of the sets. I would definately suggest this as a gift to any fan, or even a guilty pleasure for one's self!
B000002U82|5.0|THIS ALBUM IS GREAT AND HAS STUCK UP THERE IN THE CHARTS.EVEN NOWADAYS KIDS ARE BUYING THIS ALBUM.BUT ENOUGH OF THAT LISTEN TO THIS ALBUM WHILE WATCHING \\" THE WIZARD OF OZ \\", IT GOES RIGHT ALONG WITH THE MOVIE WONDERFULLY.

038542471X|3.0|\\"The Client\\" clearly shows both the strengths and weaknesses of Grisham's writing: On the hand, the book is a reasonably entertaining, diverting page-turner in which the central characters are an 11 year old boy, and a middle-aged woman. On the other hand, Grisham's inability to write convincing dialogue for the child protagonist often made me cringe. In his desire to portray the kid as precocious, Grisham often only managed to make the kid sound ridiculous, putting words and phrases in his mouth that were completely out of the range of an 11 year old. Grisham doesn't seem to grasp that an advanced 11 year old boy doesn't talk like a 30 year old; rather, he speaks like a smart 11 year old. Even something so simple as asking his lawyer, \\"Were you bitter?\\" misses the mark. Boys that age (coming from trailer parks no less) don't use emotionally nuanced words like that. Instead, he would say, \\"Were you mad when that happened?\\" The flaws in the characterization of the kid permeates the book, and detracts quite a bit from its ability to draw the reader in. As I read, I kept wondering, where were the editors?

B00006X06U|5.0|Joni Mitchell has always been a personal favorite of mine - especially the era of \\"hejira, don juan's reckless daughter and mingus\\". travelogue is an amazing collection of mitchell songs that have undergone much the same treatment as her previous album 'both sides now' (also highly recommended) with lavish and very beautiful orchestral arrangements; courtesy of vince mendoza. the songs are just as poignant and prolific as before and if you're a mitchell fan - buy it you won't be disappointed!!!
B000001FS6|2.0|Only two songs are great Desire, All I want is you!!! <br /> <br />There are some good live performaces, but Helter Skelter, and All along the watch tower covers were very bad moves!!! <br /> <br />If you're a die hard fan, buy this for the two songs I mentioned because they're classics, but otherwise this is hardly essential!!!
1558908382|5.0|This film has everything someone wants in a comedy: excellent writing and storyline, very good and well-placed soundtrack, solid acting, and just a touch of action to keep a quick pace. <br /> <br />The premise is simple:  a professional killer goes to his 10-year high school reunion.  At first, it just seems like a veiled romantic comedy.  Once you start to see the movie unfold, you can see a lot of effort went into making it.  It's especially exciting to see Cusack show off his martial arts training in one of the fight sequences.  Moreover, the fight and shootout scenes are well-choreographed and look realistic. <br /> <br />Aside from the action, the story is very intersting.  Initially, Cusack's character, Martin Blank, is very adjusted in his choice of professions.  However, when he returns home and realizes how precious life is, the transformation begins.   <br /> <br />This is a must have for a John Cusack fan.
B0006399FS|1.0|Who use idiotic remarks such as \\"Best release since Joshua Tree, best for ages, best ever!!!\\" <br /> <br />Please this isn't even better than ATYCLB and that's 2 stars at best!!! <br /> <br />Please buy Joshua Tree, Achtung Baby, and Unforgettable fire!!!!
B00092ZL80|5.0|I really enjoyed it.  good sound.  I only watched the first half so far, the EWF performance.  I can't honestly comment on the Chicago portion of the concert.

B0007TKNL0|5.0|There's no reason why fans of the stage production should not enjoy this lush big-screen presentation.  If anything, they should like it more!  Film allows so much more dimension, and fleshing out of a few points (like how the Phantom came to the Opera) that are too awkward to explore on stage.  Not to mention the ability to see characters up close - that's probably why Sarah and Michael were replaced with younger, fresher, and let's face it (ha ha), more attractive characters.  Thank goodness. Emmy sings like an angel and is just as lovely, and far better suited to a film role than Sarah, who besides being too old for the role of Christine, tends to make silly faces and bug eyes when she sings.  Keep her on stage where she belongs, a good distance from the audience.  And then there's the Phantom...yum!  Who cares that half his face is bad, the other half is rugged and handsom.  If only he wasn't a bit psycho...  The original Phantom novel makes much of the fact that Eric is an incredible singer, but since the Webber play/movie hardly follows the book at all, I think choosing a non-singer to play the Phantom in the movie version was a smart move. Gerard's voice is perfectly suited to conveying raw emotion that a professional singer might try to polish up and control.  I agree that no one sings Music of the Night quite as well as Michael, but he's a bit effete, and of course too old.  This film bursts with emotion, lavish sets and costumes that can finally be appreciated up close, and a brilliantly selected cast from the Phantom down to the stage hands.  Bravo! Bravo! Bravissimo!
0953104907|4.0|The book is somewhat jumbled, but still has a wealth of information, he discourages certain things to quickly like making a Flying V for your first guitar but does offer an array of resources such as Luthier suppliers in the UK, AUSTRALIA and US as well as some very useful templates.His book coupled with Matrin Koch's should be all you need but Koch's writing seems more impartial and easier to apply within the chronologically process of making your dream axe, All in all worth having with some exstensive historical insight into the birth of our beloved electric guitar.

B000000OTY|5.0|This double album is a great album that captures songs we all know in it's greatest form.  Peter's voice is phenomenal.  This version of \\"In Your Eyes\\" can be played from any boombox standing outside a lucky girls window!
B000001FDE|4.0|Few bands could have gone through the challenges this band has and still come out swinging (Def Leppard is one that comes to mind).  It makes one wonder just how much better they could have been had both Duane Allman and Berry Oakley made it to middle age instead of dying so tragically so early on and in such similar circumstances too.<br /><br />Still, Dickey Betts pulls off the guitar parts very admirably by himself and composed both the strong tracks from this album, the great \\"Ramblin' Man\\" (probably the best pentatonic scale guitar solo ever)and \\"Jessica\\" the latter named after his daughter.  For those of you who have played in bands and jammed a lot, you'll know what I mean about this being a great jam band as they were capable of tracks that ran into 20 mins to even 30 minutes on \\"Mountain Jam\\" from their \\"Eat a Peach\\" album just before this.  However, just jamming and letting each member of the band play his stuff (a lot like old time jazz musicians do) is what this band is good at and it shows in tracks like \\"Southbound\\" and \\"Pony Boy\\".<br /><br />This album is a pretty good one and overall the sound quality is very good considering the copy I have is not the remastered one.  I see that the remastered version is the same price and so I guess you might as well go get that version of this cd if you can.<br /><br />A very good example of the post-Duane version of the band.  If you consider that Duane Allman together with Eric Clapton were probably the greatest blues guitarists of their time when Duane died (just hear their work together on Derek and the Dominoes' \\"Layla\\")the loss is truly great and one cannot but wonder at what might have been.<br /><br />Alas, we'll never know but get this and \\"Eat a Peach\\" if you want to get the best of the Allman Brothers' work.  If you are a guitarist and want to learn what great blues and slide work sounds like, get these two as well as the \\"Live at Fillmore East\\" albums as essential listening material.

B0007Y08IS|2.0|The politics of this film are quite clear.  Just take a look at who's targeted.  Cheney, Wolfowitz, and co are left alone while anyone who criticised the war in Iraq is presented as dim-witted friends of Kim Jong-Il.  Neither the Bush government nor the Israeli government face any substantial critical commentary, while Arabs are represented on the whole as brainless psychopaths and anti-war activists as not much better. <br /> <br />I must say that I am/was a fan of South Park, and I even laughed at Orgazmo.  But this was not funny, indeed I'd be surprised if anyone bar the more jingoistic sections of American public found it so.  I really can't see the joke in it.
078681859X|4.0|A great beach or lake-side read (or, better yet, a rainy day!). The wit and quips in this fantastical book are quite sophisticated and will stretch anyone's brain--especially good for the precarious young lady or gentleman. The alternating points of view keep the reader right in the middle of the action and serve to paint a more complete picture of the action and intrigue on all seven planes! A great series opener.
B00006RU5B|3.0|Let's go Three 1/2 Stars, really.  Sound Garden was one of the few Grunge bands that could actually compose a melody, and that is one of the features the makes Audioslave interesting.  You take Rage Against the Machine and make them more \\"singy\\", so it's not just beats and guitar and words.  These songs are sung. <br />Tom Morello is not a traditional lead guitarist with speedy note-by-note runs, and that turns out to be his strength, because he comes up with the most interesting ideas for sounds, and executes them well.  It's exciting to hear a new CD of his because as the songs gear up for the middle eight solo, you have NO idea what's coming.  It's like being on a new roller coaster for the first time, slowly cranking up those rails until . . . WHOOSH!   <br />Chris Cornell has a great voice, and can scream with the best of them, but towards the end of the CD, you're a bit tired that almost every song is a screamer.  A little more variety would make for a more captivating album, with valleys and crescendos.  The songs on the second half of the CD are a little too similar, and the feeling I had was that ten or eleven songs (instead of 14) would have made for a stronger piece.

B000002MTU|4.0|This album proves two things very well: 1) Clap loves the blues and this music is very soulful for him (and thus, for the audience); 2) Clap can play guitar.  When BB King was asked, of all the guitarists he has played with (and he has jammed with a few!), which one was the best, his reply was Clapton.    For pure blues guitar, this is the best performance I've heard from Clapton.  Sometimes his playing is a bit TOO held-back on other works, but he just plain lets go here, and it feels good--Blues Good!  The songs are infectious as well, lots of great blues standards.  Were Clapton a better singer, I'd give it five stars.  4 1/2 Stars.  This guy doesn't make anything but good albums, but this is one of his better ones.
B0007Y4TVU|4.0|I reallllly love this cd. It's not quite as good as Toxicity in my opinion, but I think that's just cause i'm a little prejudiced towards their previous release.  Nevertheless, they take their music in a slightly different direction with Mezmerize.  In Radio-Video you even hear an Armenian vibe, and Old School Hollywood is kind of more punk-related with the drumming, and Lost in Hollywood is a slow-paced ballad compared to the rest of the album.  Despite all this, there are still those characteristics in the music that make this a distinct SOAD album.  Listen to it if you want to get your heart pumping and the adrenaline rush that you get with nu metal like this.  It's great music to blast in your car and scream to or jump around or however you react to hardcore fast SOAD songs.  The only thing I don't like is that Daron gets too much air time with his vocals.  Don't get me wrong, I love his voice, it's wacky and awesomely unique, but with Mezmerize he frequently gets more air time than Serj and nothing can compare to Serj's crazy and innovative vocals.  There's something about Serj that you just can't measure up to, so he should still be lead singer for most of the album at least.  Hopefully the up-coming follow-up album will restore Serj to his rightful place.  But anyways, the lyrics on Mezmerize are constantly amazing, their meanings sometimes subliminal and requiring a little bit of thinking.  They incorporate everything from their views on politics, big corporations, and stuck-up celebrities.  Definitely worthwhile listening material.  My favorites have to be revenga, radio/video, question!, sad statue, and old school hollywood.  But yea if you don't have it yet, what are you waiting for, this is an absolute must have!
B0007DAZW8|5.0|Well, I glad I purchased this album on a whim and avoided being tainted by any of the many negative reviews floating around.  Very few seem to get Daft Punk's latest exploration of house.  It is hard to take any of the major 'zines critics seriously when the song one claims as \\"trite satire of their own repetitive nature\\" the next claims as \\"the only worthy song on the album.\\"  It appears one man's garbage may very well be another man's treasure.  <br /> <br />Really if you don't get this album, you probably don't get Daft Punk.  If you only like Discovery, then you probably just like disco, not Daft Punk.  If you only like Homework, you probably just like floor-pounding beats, not Daft Punk.  From acid-house to disco-house to minimalist-house, Daft Punk won't play the same card twice. <br /> <br />Daft Punk is art, not really daft nor punk.  Or maybe, both.
B00008LDPV|4.0|The Animatrix is a collection of 9 short animated films inspired by the story and concepts of \\"The Matrix\\". Larry and Andy Wachowski, the creators of \\"The Matrix\\", commissioned 7 different animation directors to contribute to the universe of \\"The Matrix\\" by creating short films that reflect their authors' personal styles and ideas about the Matrix. Four of the nine episodes were written by the Wachowski brothers themselves. Probably due to their short length, the films are more vignettes than stories. They present ideas and images but only partial narratives. The animation styles vary widely and give a nice sampling of animation today. There are so many distinct styles to choose from that every viewer is likely to find something in this collection to his/ her taste.<br /><br />The choices for your viewing pleasure are:<br /><br />\\"Final Flight of the Osiris\\" directed by Andy Jones, written by the Wachowski brothers: This film is arguably the most beautiful of the collection. It takes place inside a training program and on board a ship that is being hunted by sentinels. The animation is stunning, sexy and emphasizes the beauty of movement within the Matrix.<br /><br />\\"The Second Renaissance, Parts I and II\\" directed by Mahiro Maeda, written by the Wachowski brothers: These are two short films by the same director which address the question of why and how humans and machines came to be at war with one another. The history of Man and Machine, from the creation of machines until the enslavement of humans in the Matrix, is recounted by a Zion Archive historical file. Since the Wachowski brothers wrote these films, I guess this is the official word on how humans came to be in the predicament we see in The Matrix. I was not impressed by the animation in these two films, but they have the strongest narrative of the collection. They also have a clearly stated moral: \\"Bless All Forms of Intelligence.\\"<br /><br />\\"Kid's Story\\" directed by Shinichiro Watanabe, written by the Wachowski brothers: Unlike the others, this film is directly related to \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\". It tells the story of how the young man who we see fawning over Neo a lot in \\"Reloaded\\" came to free himself from the Matrix. As Neo would say, and did say...repeatedly: \\"I didn't save you. You saved yourself.\\" The voices of Keanu Reeves and Carrie-Anne Moss are featured briefly.<br /><br />\\"Program\\" by Yoshiaki Kawajiri: One of the shortest and least interesting of the collection, Program tells the story of a human who wants to return to the Matrix and tries to convince his lover to go with him.<br /><br />\\"World Record\\" by Takeshi Koike: One rare human discovers the Matrix, not through a computer, but through his great athletic ability. Also pretty short, this one has an interesting premise and very stylized animation.<br /><br />\\"Beyond\\" by Koji Morimoto: A young woman goes off in search of her cat and finds a \\"haunted house\\" where the Matrix is malfunctioning. There is no message or underlying theme here. It's just a glimpse into the life a someone who accidentally discovers the Matrix and does not understand what she has discovered.<br /><br />\\"A Detective Story\\" by Shinichiro Watanabe: Animated in the style of a Philip Marlowe or Mike Hammer movie, this film is the story of a private detective who is hired by agents to find Trinity. The voice of Carrie-Anne Moss is featured.<br /><br />\\"Matriculated\\" by Peter Chung: Humans have a plan to convert some of the machines to their cause by exploiting the fact that machines cannot distinguish reality from simulation. To machines, \\"all reality is virtual\\". That is about as far as the story goes. Much of this film is very abstract. Pay close attention to the behavior of the machine; it is the most notable aspect of this film.by the Wachowski brothers: Unlike the others, this film is directly related to \\"The Matrix Reloaded\\".

020530902X|5.0|\\"The Elements of Style\\", written by Professor William Strunk Jr. in the 1910s and revised and augmented by E.B. White, his former student, in the 1950s, is still the most helpful guide to writing English prose in the smallest package. The book includes sections on: Rules of Usage, Principals of Composition, Matters of Form, Words and Expressions Commonly Misused, and a section entitled \\"An Approach to Style\\" in which Mr. White offers some excellent advice on style in the broader sense of writing that reflects the author's personality or tastes. There is also a glossary of grammar and usage terms in the back of the book. The section on English usage is useful but not comprehensive. And I believe a couple of the rules are outdated, even though this 4th edition was published in the year 2000. The rest of the book is truly dedicated to \\"the elements of style\\", meaning a writing style's most essential considerations. The authors explain, with good humor and language that is easy to understand, the \\"dos and don'ts\\" for writing clear and effective prose. These rules and recommendations can probably be summarized by saying, \\"Be direct and concise.\\" But \\"The Elements of Style\\" tells the reader how to accomplish this goal. This book doesn't address how to structure a paragraph or organize an essay, so writers seeking advice on these topics will need some additional text. \\"The Elements of Style\\" is dedicated to constructing sentences in the most effective style. Middle school, high school,  and college students -and anyone who would like to refresh his or her writing skills- will find \\"The Elements of Style\\" helpful, especially in writing academic prose. Messrs. Strunk and White have extracted the most essential points of writing good English, recognized the most common mistakes, and put them into this small, inexpensive and easily absorbed little book.
B000646MNE|5.0|I just finished watching the complete series of Sex and the City and I must say this is a must-have.  The characters are very well developed and has the series goes on, deeper subjects and issues are discussed, but always in a cute and pleasant way. <br />And what to say about the costumes!  Patricia Field is a genius and she made this series a nice base for contemporary fashion and style.  Fashion students will love it!
B000094J5S|3.0|Nice guy Mitch (Luke Wilson) has found his girlfriend cheating on him. Puerile Frank (Will Ferrell) has recently married and may have gotten himself in over his head. And Beanie (Vince Vaughn), their cynical friend who is securely married with children, sees it all as an opportunity to party like they did when they were young. To start anew, Mitch leases a house that happens to be right next to a college campus. At Beanie's urging, the house becomes party central for the nearby college students. In an effort to shut the parties down, the Dean of the university succeeds in having the house zoned for university use only. So the revelers declare themselves a fraternity -an equal opportunity fraternity that will admit any man of any age who wants to pledge. When the conniving Dean comes up with a new plan to shut them down, the guys will have to prove that they are a real fraternity or close their doors permanently.<br /><br />To say that \\"Old School\\"'s humor is sophomoric would be an understatement. \\"Old School\\"'s humor is infantile. The audience is hit over the head with gross-out physical comedy, beer bongs, K-Y jelly wrestling, nudity, and four-letter words. And the film does not apologize for it. \\"Old School\\" spoofs and celebrates fraternity life. And some of it is funny. But the gags get tiresome, and boredom sets in only a third of the way through the film. It may be the lack of credibility, and therefore sympathy, in the characters. At no point in this film does it make any sense that Mitch is even involved with the fraternity. Or it may be that gross-out jokes fall flat after the first \\"oh, gross\\". But I found \\"Old School\\" to be a snooze.<br /><br />I wasn't impressed by any of the main characters, but there are a few supporting roles that may be worth mentioning. I like Juliette Lewis' swinging girlfriend character a lot. Ex-Late Late Show host Craig Kilborn does a very convincing obnoxious womanizer. And Ellen Pompeo jumps off the screen as Mitch's potential love interest, Nicole. The camera loves her, so I think we'll be seeing more of Pompeo in the future. If frat-boy humor is your thing, you might enjoy \\"Old School\\". Otherwise, I don't think that you will find the few good jokes and supporting performances worth your time.icole.

Nobody getting kicked off the island, no million dollar production budget, no fake emotions for the camera... just real life...real life through the eyes of a superstar. The most real reality show ever. A one of a kind!
B0000089FS|2.0|It definitely is very sad when one great icon, can try to gracefully change the course of pop music, and yet can make a lackluster record in the process. That happens with so many acts from all over, and Elton John was definitely one of those acts. Even though he made so much in stellar music in the 1980's, he also made some unfortunately bad music. Although most of his sonnets and songs were great, not every record was met with the exact same reception. After his symphonic well recognized Live In Austrailia performance with the Melboune Symphony Orchestra, he did lose a lot on the next wave.<br /><br />Reg Strikes Back, Elton's 1988 album, was arguably met with a lot of angst, and tabloid fallout from The Sun magazine, and his end of a marraige as well. The album simply put does have some bright spots within great tracks like I Don't Wanna Go On With You Like That, and the soulful A Word In Spanish. Other than that, the album doesn't try to capture Elton very well in this compilation, especially with so many unfortunate tales including a less than embraceable sequel to Mona Lisas & Mad Hatters, and some even more weak tracks like the grim Goodbye Marlon Brando as well. Although the album has been remastered wel, the songs still don't have the feeling other records did.<br /><br />For die hard Elton John fans, Reg Strikes Back is not one of the must owns in any album collection. Other than only buying this for a pair of pop gems, this record doesn't carry a whole lot for everyone. Many will want to go on with this like that.<br /><br />Album Cover: B+<br /><br />Price: C-<br /><br />Songs: D+<br /><br />Remastering: C+<br /><br />Overall: D+
B00003RQNJ|5.0|Wow!!!   One of my top 100 movies.  Paul Newman plays the dark humored Butch Cassidy and Robert Redford plays the grimmly straight Sundance Kid.    <br />    Butch and Sundance were famous train robbers from the early 20th century on the edge of the last hey day of the truly wild west.  The Union Pacific Railroad hired a select group of lawmen to hunt down and kill or capture. (Let's be honest Kill) The two Outlaws.  The Outlaws were never heard from again.  Some believe that they went to Bolivia and were killed by the Bolivian Army.  <br />    This movie tracks the final days of Butch and Sundance.  Uproariously funny.  No matter how dark the sitiuation, these two outlaws manage to drop a darkly humorous line. This is the kind of movie that you and your friends will quote often. A tad violent for children, but on the upside no cussing. I highly recommend this movie.
1400032717|3.0|This book is certainly written from a very unique perspective.  The scenario should lead the reader to believe this book was written by an autistic fifteen year old boy.  I found the insights about autism to be very eye-opening. <br /> <br />At the same time, I wondered if the author had ever been in the company of an autistic person.  Just where did Mark Haddon find his insight? <br /> <br />The story was weak.  I realize this was supposed to be the life of an autistic child, but I found it hard to believe the author needed to go to such depths to explain a dislike for the color yellow. <br /> <br />In the end, I stopped reading the book.  I hope one day to finish it.  Maybe when I can get put aside my scientific brain, and stop questioning the story line. <br />
B000819PKC|3.0|If you're a big fan of them like I am you'll enjoy this latest effort, you will however notice that song for song it may not compare to the older albums in content. Gone are the days of the global peace and equality messages, but the music stays true to who they are essentially. Someone else mentioned the split with Stuart Zender has had an impact and I agree, the Synchronized vibe is gone, but the album is still good on the whole. I HAD to have it when it came out, but the truth is, I've taken it out of rotation already...
0765348780|4.0|I was just recently introduced to Steven Erikson's work. I have primarily read Dragonlance and Forgotten Realms novels. While I still enjoy those two worlds a great deal, I was starting to find myself getting into a rut and not being surprised anymore.<br /><br />So, I come to Erikson's work. Garden's of the Moon is the first book of his i have read and I am amazed at his ability to tell a story. Finding a new author you enjoy is a great gift indeed. I liken it to cleaning your couch and finding a $20 under a cushion. A wealth you never knew about.<br /><br />Like I said at the start, if you (like me) are a fan of Forgotten Realms and Dragonlance give this first book a shot. I am eagerly looking forward to getting ahold of the next couple of books in this series.
B0000844I8|2.0|I won't bother with providing a review of the film.  Many people before me have provided many good reviews of the film.  My 'star rating' is for the DVD release only (I really enjoyed the film and would give it 4 stars).  I thought it might be useful to provide a few comparisons on the two DVD versions that are available.  I have the June, 1997 release of the film provided by LIVE Entertainment as well as the new 'Ultimate Edition' released in 2004.   <br /> <br />The 1997 DVD version provides a trailer and a teaser for the film; an information section of the cast and crew; audio selection for English or French language; and a choice of English, Spanish, or French subtitles.  The menus are all still (no motion or videos), but are all crisp and easily navigated.  The only real down side of the disc is that it is a 'flippy'... a two-sided disc that you must turn over to resume the film.  Otherwise, The film looks great and contains what I believe is the 'theatrical release' of the film (one place in the packaging lists the film runtime as 119 mins. and in another place it lists it as 122 mins. ??) <br /> <br />The \\"Ultimate Edition, Extended Cut Stargate DVD\\" released in February, 2004 by Artisan Entertainment is a little different than the version that was released in 1997.  The DVD packaging tells you this is a 119 minute version (same as the 1997 edition), but nowhere on the box does it tell you if this is the \\"Special\\" edition or the \\"Director's Cut\\" (per IMDB).  The audio provides three different English language tracks (why only English and why three?).  There is only one subtitle track in Spanish (I guess the French folks are out of luck for this version).  There is a new commentary track by Devlin and Emmerich and a short by Erich von Daniken about his 1960's \\"Chariots of the Gods\\" theories.  There are no trailers or teasers or cast and crew bios. Overall, the new version was mastered 'lighter' than the earlier work, as though the DVD crew decided the film wastoo dark and they needed to increase the brightness control.  While this bright effect improved the opening credits, allowing you to see the details of the egyptian mask better than before, overall I found it gave the entire film a washed out, grainy look.  The scene where Doctor Jackson comes out of the hotel before getting into Catherine Langford's car in the pouring rain is so bright it looks like the sun should be out. Some of the effects scenes do not hold up well with the brighter look.  The scene where the Stargate team first see the inhabitants of Abydos for the first time in the long shot seemed to look a lot more 'fake' than in the original version. <br /> <br />So, in all, I was somewhat disappointed in the new \\"Ultimate Edition\\" DVD.  They really didn't improve upon the original release with extras, they actually took away some of the extras of the earlier version.  I also did not care for the 'brighter' look they gave the film.  To me the colors looked washed out and grainy compared to the earlier release. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0786915749|5.0|This was the first fantasy book I ever read... back some 15 plus years ago. I haven't stopped reading since.<br /><br />This novel jump starts the world of Krynn and the Dragonlance franchise. I was never a 'gamer' so I didn't have any preconceived notions on what to expect. Yet, what I found was a rich world, with facinating characters.<br /><br />The entire story takes place over three book, this being the first book it has a few things to 'set in motion', some of which you don't fully appreciate until the last pages of the third book.<br /><br />During this trilogy you will laugh, you will cry and you may be so mad you will slam the book down only to come back later. These books are a roller coaster ride that which is rarely seen in the fantasy genre. Weis and Hickman do a seemless job of combining their writing talents to to captivate the reader into reading well past 3 AM when they need to be at work by 7 AM!<br /><br />If you are comtemplating reading this trilogy, give the first book a shot. After all, what have you got to lose? I think you lose more by NOT trying it.

156224003X|4.0|I've heard a lot about Mr. Werner's Effortless Mastery title.  In fact, I know a band whose two primary musicians constantly bicker about whether this \\"effortless\\" approach is viable.  After years of hearing about it, I decided to find out for myself. <br /> <br />The book starts out with one basic premise: you are an aspiring, practicing musician, looking to \\"break through\\" to higher grounds of playing.  Many people are at this stage, but have a fear of unfamiliar musical territory.  The bulk of this book is dedicated to removing this fear. <br /> <br />Werner's approach to doing so is by breaking down negative programming that's been beaten into aspiring musicians worldwide throughout their music careers.  Some have a fear that's instilled by their teachers, who constantly tell them they're not good enough, not perfect enough, not smooth enough.  Others have this fear imbued by \\"great\\" musicians - those who seem to push the boundaries and perform inhuman feats on their instrument.  According to Mr. Werner, all this negative programming eventually becomes an insurmountable barrier for advancement - unless it is reversed and positive programming is imposed on the musician.  Who will impose this programming?  Most likely, it will be the musician himself. <br /> <br />Again, the basic premise comes into play: you must work on your technique, learn new music, and address your weaknesses.  That is a given, and there is no way around it.  However, you must also have a positive outlook while doing so - otherwise all the imperfections you've ironed out during practice will come back to haunt you in performance. <br /> <br />Some of the initial chapters reveal in great depth Mr. Werner's personal experience.  In his younger years, he went through all the negative programming himself, and has learned (and continues learning) how to reverse it.  It is from the standpoint of this experience that he approaches the subject-matter. <br /> <br />Through gradual guidance in the later chapters (and the three meditations on the included CD), Mr. Werner tries to help the student create a personal space, in which the student is master.  By revisiting this space and learning to practice and perform from within this space, the student will become the master and reveal his inner voice.  Don't expect to become an overnight master effortlessly, however: Werner suggests that learning to play from within the space will require relearning the instrument from scratch.  This is a slow process at the beginning, but becomes natural as time goes by. <br /> <br />Unfortunately for many, a lot of the points made in this book are self-evident, or at least should be.  Nonetheless, his encouraging tone instills the belief that mastery is possible.  In the end, the student will hopefully realize that mastery is, by definition, effortless. <br /> <br />Some sections of this book are specific to particular instruments.  Werner is a pianist, so quite a few examples are piano-related; he also talks about some other common jazz instruments, notably wind and brass.  To my dismay, the guitar isn't mentioned, but the general pointers in the book allow this approach to be taylored to any instrument, and even to activities beyond music and arts in general. <br />
0765309408|5.0|The title of my review isn't fair; I'm making it sound as though John Scalzi's first novel is a mishmash of Robert A. Heinlein works. It's not; in fact it's refreshingly original, and you certainly don't have to be a Heinlein fan (or even to have read Heinlein) in order to enjoy and appreciate it. But as Scalzi himself remarks in his acknowledgements, the influence _is_ fairly obvious.<br /><br />At any rate, I really like the book -- and on its own merits, not just because it reminds me of Heinlein. (Nor is it just because the hero, John Nicholas Perry, hails from the county seat of Darke County in my home state of Ohio, where Scalzi now lives.) Scalzi is a fine writer and his ideas sparkle off the page.<br /><br />I won't spoil anything for you; just keep your eyes peeled for at least one really cool idea every three or four pages. (And if Scalzi hasn't blown your mind within the first couple hundred pages, it'll happen when Alan Rosenthal explains how the skip drive works.) I can't really tell you anything specific without giving away something better left for you to discover as you read.<br /><br />I can say in general, though, that Scalzi has a pretty healthy sense of what it will take for human beings to colonize other planets in a universe that contains other sentient species. (And I think he has a better appreciation of moral ambiguity than Heinlein did even on his best day.) He's also got a knack for thinking up clever and gruesome ways for people to die. Oh, and there's a lot of nicely handled bittersweet stuff that may bring tears to your eyes if you're inclined to that sort of thing.<br /><br />All in all, a fine first novel; I'll look forward to reading his next (_Agent to the Stars_) as well as what appears to be a sequel currently in the works (_The Ghost Brigades_). And welcome to Ohio, John.
B00005JMYI|5.0|Will Ferrell stars in this movie playing a newsman in the 70's in San Deigo, and while I wasn't to much of a fan of Elf, but I do have to say that I really see Ferrell playing a newsman, then see him play a giant elf, or a human that doesn't know he is a human, that thinks he is an elf. As the movie opens, Ron Burgundy (Will Ferrell), sportscaster Champ Kind (David Koechner), weatherman Brick Tamland (Steve Carell) and reporter Brian Fantana (Paul Rudd), are the top news team in all of San Deigo. Wes Mantooth (Vince Vaughn), is the top anchor at the station that is second to Channel 4, and he hates Ron Burgundy, and would do anything to be the number 1 anchor. Ron lvies by himself with his dog, but then one day Ed Harken (Fred Willard) hires Veronica Corningstone (Married with Children's Christina Applegate) as a reporter. And without welcoming her, they make comments on her assets, and even maybe try to score with her. But then Ron manges to get him to agree to a date, as co-workers as he intoruces her the city that she will be broadcasting news to. And then soon she is prompted to the anchor desk, to co-host the news with Ron, but watch what you put on the teleprompter, because Ron will read whatever yout put up there.
B0009QBLA8|4.0|It's difficult to take Eraserhead seriously, really. It's more of a film student's exercise than a proper film, really; and if Mr. Lynch says in interviews that he refuses to reveal what Eraserhead is about because he wants each viewer to try and figure it out for himself, the only reason for saying it is that he has a mysterious reputation to maintain; or, in other words, he's full of horse manure. Eraserhead is about nothing. It's an exercise in visuals, in visual effects done at minimum budget; and homage to the German Expressionism of the 1920's that Lynch obviously loves so dearly, influences of which are obvious here but can be seen in all of his movies up to Mulholland Drive. <br />  <br />It's painfully pointless to try to find a deeper meaning connecting all the pseudo-surreal dream-scenes in Eraserhead; it's better to just sit back and enjoy the grotesque humor, the creepy visuals and the eerie music and to appreciate Mr. Lynch's unique and strong sense for atmosphere, for his completely original freak-show vision of the grotesque and the bizarre, in the very early stages of its development. Eraserhead is the perfect preface to Lynch's celebrated career, and while most people will find it pretentious, dull and incomprehensible - which, invariably, it truly is - it's essential viewing for devoted fans of this unique director; for lovers of grotesque, dark visual humor; and for students and those interested in the history of cinema, and especially in German Expressionism like that of Murnau and his contemporaries. Remember that this is merely an exercise created by a young and enthusiastic filmmaker making his first steps as a pro; don't judge it too harshly, but also don't bother with the effort of seeking a depth to it. It's not worth it.
0440224764|3.0|This was a perfect read for a few days on the beach.  As many of the other reviewers state, there are pros and cons to the book.<br /><br />The book was very riveting from the beginning.  Grisham does a good job painting characters and developing them so you like them, often in spite of yourself.<br /><br />Lanigan is introduced as a man who faked his death in a car accident, stole money from his firm and fled to Brazil for a new life.  Somehow, and I'm not sure how, Grisham got you liking and rooting for the guy from the get-go.  I kept thinking things like:<br /><br />\\"But he left his wife and child?\\"<br /><br />\\"He stole money from a client and his partners?\\"<br /><br />\\"What about that body in the car?\\"<br /><br />You like Lanigan because you are sure that as the story unfolds, those things will be explained and somehow Lanigan will NOT be the bad guy it seems he is.  The anticipation of the resolution of those issues, and how he plans to \\"free himself\\" (because he obviously has a plan) made it VERY hard to put the book down.  I was definitely into it.<br /><br />I said I enjoyed 95% of the book...the ending was kind of unsatisfactory.  All of the above questions were resolved, but they were done so with a lot of things that were unbelievable or patently absurd.<br /><br />(**SPOILERS below**)<br /><br />Also, Grisham spends so much time and effort making things \\"work out\\" for Lanigan, he kind of takes the reader on an emotional rollercoaster.  Endings don't have to be happy, but I felt the ending was unnecessarily emotionally violent (if you get my drift).  To explain, Grisham finally resolves the issues and you start to feel good because you are finally \\"allowed\\" to unashamedly like Patrick Lanigan.  No sooner do you start to look forward to his sailing off into the sunset, Grisham rips the rug out from under you and screws Patrick in the end.  I can like a good tragedy.  I can appreciate an unhappy ending that makes you think.  This book doesn't seem to be any of that.  It just seemed like a waste of emotional effort.<br /><br />Maybe I'm missing something, but here are examples of some of the things in the \\"working out\\" that I felt were ridiculous (WARNING SPOILERS):<br /><br />- Lanigan was supposedly spent a year developing his \\"skills\\", which included vanishing himself without a trace, making money vanish without a trace, learning another language, etc.  He mentioned in the book that he wanted to run away even if he didn't have millions of bucks, but without stealing a bunch of money, all of those skills were totally unnecessary.  If you want to leave your wife and kids and go tend bar somewhere and live like a bum, you don't need crack criminal skills.  It just so happened that an opportunity to steal $90MM came out of the sky?  It seems to me that he began developing his \\"skills\\" way before it would be apparent he would have use for them.<br /><br />- It seemed having a body to fake his death was necessary.  It just so happened that his old friend kicks the bucket just prior to his primo opportunity to embezzle tons of funds?  That's an amazing coincidence.  It never mentioned a \\"back up plan\\" to kill himself, did it?  And, is it reasonable to assume that no one is going to open that casket and catch you stealing the corpse (he was the only one there who may have taken it!)?<br /><br />- If this guy was SO smart, I can't believe he would be so stupid as to place $140ishMM in the hands of someone who could so easily sell him out in the end (I saw this coming).<br /><br />- Assuming your wife will drop all lawsuits against you (and potentially forfeiting her claim to millions of dollars in joint assets, plus who knows what in pain and suffering) because you have some naked pictures of her seems unreasonable.  His wife didn't seem like they type who WOULDN'T trade a little public embarrassment for big $$$.<br /><br />- If the chick stole his ~$30MM, why didn't she bolt with the money when there was $140ishMM?  She hung around to give $90MM back?<br /><br />- I found the fact that he basically \\"turned himself in\\" by tipping off the investigators to his whereabouts totally ridiculous.  If the guy managed to live on the lam for 4 years and knew they were on his tail, he surely could have picked himself up and disappeared again.  Doing that every now and then CERTAINLY seems safer than turning yourself in, risking you won't be killed, risking that everything in your amazingly complex legal plan works, and having to rely on another individual not to steal $100+MM from you (*cough*), etc, etc.<br /><br />** END OF SPOILERS**<br /><br />Well, those are my complaints.  I can live with most of them, even though the sum total makes it a bit ridiculous.  So, take it for what it's worth.  You'll have a good time reading the book, but probably find yourself a little hollow feeling at the end.was $140ishMM?

B00005JN2Z|1.0|For decades, movie fans have had to wade through a lot of crap to find a quality flicker out there. One of the biggest problems I've seen with more recent movies is that they start off strong then peter out towards the end. I don't know if film makers keep running out of money or they want to wrap up shooting and go party or - I don't know what the problem is exactly, but it's prevalent. If you can't see that this movie devolves into preposterous cliches, then you're part of the reason the movie industry continues to pump out so much crap. How many more played-to-death ideas, remakes and rehashed cheesy T.V. sitcoms will the public tolerate? Sadly, I see no end in sight.<br /><br /> . . . and while I'm ranting, I think all the good reviews of this flim from \\"professional\\" critics tell you a few things: 1) many of these people are too stupid to do anything useful for a living 2) payola has gotten WAY out of hand. That's the kind of society we create when capitalism is allowed to run amoke. If the only thing that matters is money, choices will be made at the expence of morality, the environment, society as a whole, etc. Have you noticed how prevalent and acceptable cheating has become in out schools? Greed has become the American way. We've gotten on an irreversable collision course with hell. We're doomed! . . . The movie ratings I get with my cable system(the neo-Nazi, rape&pillage monopoly known as [. . .]) are generally pretty reliable, except when there's a big budget push for a mega-movie. Thus, multi-million dollar dreck like STAR WARS EPISODE 1 and COLLATERAL were awarded good ratings.<br /><br />So you see, this isn't just a bad movie, it's a signpost of the impending doom of civilization as we know it!
B000000OSE|5.0|Use your illusions is one of the best G'N'R albums after Apetite for destruction as it contains one of the most beatiful songs ever,november rain.hugely recommended.
B00008J2DQ|1.0|I know it has been said on here many times before, this band is a complete AIC rip-off. If you don't beleive me, this cover looks very alike to the AIC album \\"Facelift.\\" The guy from this band said that he did indead take his band's name from a track on \\"Dirt.\\" Sully Erna even tries to look like Layne Staley. The sun logo first appeared on \\"Dirt.\\" And it even so happens that they haven't participated on any Jerry Cantrell disc. This band sucks, Their firt album was tolerable, but then, when Layne Staley died and their secret was exposed. And that's all true because I have a habit of researching bands, and being AIC is my favorite group, I know plenty about them. Get \\"Dirt\\" for a better an origanal sound.
B000000OSG|5.0|Use your illusions 2 is as good as the first cd and contains some of their biggest hits in you could be mine and estranged.hugely recommended.ignore the loser below.
B00005JNZ4|2.0|And I do.  I also love how Diane Lane is not afraid to look \\"not perfect\\".  But this film is formulaic and completely unrealistic.  Jake's (John Cusack) ex-wife got \\"everything\\" in the divorce, but somehow he lives in a huge loft, where he makes special wooden boats, of which he has sold none, and has no other job.  His best friend is his lawyer, who is always over at his loft and needs a date himself, however, he hooks Cusack up with the Internet dating scene, instead of meeting his own needs first.  Not likely.<br /><br />Sarah's (Diane Lane) family is so interested in her lack of dating life that they stage an intervention trying to show her pictures of both single and married guys.  Her sister puts Sarah's profile on the internet (with her high school grad picture), and the dates start coming, all of them terrible. Her sisters have their own families, but they drop everything to run to her side and commiserate with her dating woes.  Again, not likely.  Also not likely that people burst into song around the supper table.<br /><br />I think this film could have been better if it didn't try so hard to be the typical comedy romance let's not take any chances or be any different than any other comedy romance we must fit in the mold.<br /><br />2 1/2 stars. Cusack and Lane were wasted.  And so was Stockard Channing.  What was up with that role?
0385512104|4.0|This unique, genre-defying story grabs the reader immediately with a quirky mystery, an autistic kid, and an author who is clearly passionate and informed about the subject.  By the end of the story I felt that I was much more able to grasp the realities of autism as well as the extreme challenges that family and friends (not to mention complete strangers!) face when trying to figure out how to interact with an autistic person.  Compelling and compassionate without being overtly or overly so, this was an excellent concept and brilliant point of view to write a story from.<br /><br />This being said, the story/plot itself could've used a little more work--this is clearly a \\"first novel.\\"  The mystery of the \\"curious incident of the dog in the night-time\\" is revealed remarkably quickly and brushed over with surprisingly little comment (I thought Christopher was the only one whose response seemed proportionate to the rather brutal crime) ... the end of the story gave into a mass-media \\"and they all lived happily ever after\\" style resolution ... there were small inconsistencies where Christopher would say one thing and then disprove himself (for example he states that he cannot understand how people picture themselves doing something other than what they are doing, yet he easily pictures himself being an astronaut) ...<br /><br />Despite its relatively minor flaws, this book was still an excellent read.  I'm curious to see where Haddon goes from here if he decides to write another book ... this would be a hard one to follow!
B0002O06N0|4.0|Haha, wow. All the reviewers so far are from Ottawa/Toronto.<br />Anyway I saw the vid for &quot;10 AM Automatic&quot; on MuchMusic and Dan's voice blew me away. Bought the album and really enjoyed it- I'm getting more into older blues bands because of these guys.<br />Sweet album, cool guys.
0345475674|4.0|This was the first book I've read of Robert Harris, and as it was recommended to me just a few weeks before going on a vacation that would include a trip to Pompeii, I thought I'd give it a shot.  Harris' book breathed new life into the ruins as I visited them, and Vesuvius looked all the more menacing as it towered over Pompeii.<br /><br />For me, what separated this book from your typical mass-market fiction was the research that Harris obviously put into this book, as well as the unique perspective he guides the reader from.  Rather than an obvious main character (such as Pliny, or a generic centurion), we have Aquarius: a man of character and honor, who above all has a pretty cool job that provided a bit of suspense to a book with an inescapably obvious ending to anyone with even a rudimentary knowledge of Roman history!<br /><br />A fun summer read that's fascinating and well-written, Pompeii: A Novel provides a unique perspective on a famous natural disaster.  I give it a solid 4-star recommendation.
0380973634|5.0|Richard Meyhew discovers a young girl covered in blood in an ally while on his way to a formal dinner with his fianc&eacute; and her boss. Richard lives a normal life. He lives in a small, ordinary apartment in London, has a desk job with obnoxious coworkers, and a girlfriend who loves him but only if he minds is manners and does what she tells him and doesn't embarrass her.<br /><br />Well, all that went out the window the day he helped this young girl. This simple act of kindness totally erased him from the `London Above'; the London we all know. It was as if he never existed and was a ghost. This forced Richard to go in search of Door, the young girl whom he had helped. He found her in `London Below', a dramatically different, dark place of forgotten people. Door is in search of who ordered for her family to be murdered and why they did it. Richard accompanies her on her search thusly spiraling into an unimaginable adventure.<br /><br />The book reminds me of a children's bedtime story like `Alice in Wonderland' only darker and more formidable. The plot was very imaginative and the characters were quite unique. I loved how Gaiman would write the story of the assassins in one chapter then Door's story in the next then Richard's story and so forth. My only complaint is that the plot seemed to lack momentum at times and he didn't really delve into the minds of the characters very much. I didn't feel much of a connection to the characters because of this. However, it was still an amazing read. I love books like this. This was the first time I have read Neil Gaiman and I will definitely be reading more.
B0009RCPY8|5.0|SOMETHING STRANGE IN YOUR NEIGHBORHOOD - I waited when the 1st DVD Came out because I knew they would place them together. I did the same with Nerds (they combined those as well) This has to be one of the great movies from my childhood. I just remember how much the kids just LOVED it. It became the cartoons, and everything. THIS IS A GREAT BUY FOR THE $$!!
0897500482|5.0|This book is a recommended addition to your martial arts education, along with the series of books that Bruce Lee authored for Ohara Publications. Quite simply, it is a working notebook of wise sayings, applications, and diagrams of important techniques which Bruce Lee gathered while contemplating his Jeet Kune Do.  There is much practical food for thought here. As a continuing student of Judo, I found the author's notes on throwing and grappling techniques, while brief, to be very insightful.
B00092ZMDY|5.0|Well, what can i say? <br />I was lucky enough to attend one of the Melbourne shows, my second Eagles experience after seeing them in Auckland, New Zealand around 1994/95. The Eagles have been critised occasionally for having their live performances sound too much like their studio efforts, but to hear these guys live is something i thought was a once in a lifetime experience. <br />The DVD is simply superb, and the depth and volume of the content is huge value for money. All of the favourites are there, and a few new ones. Glenn Frey & Don Henley naturally dominate procedings, but Timothy & Joe Walsh both have their parts to play as the Eagles prove again that class is permanent. <br />A special treat for me was Glenn Frey singing \\"Take it to the limit\\" which had not been performed by the Eagles since their originial breakup until maybe 2002. <br />Hell Freezes over probably remains the greatest ever example of a \\"studio\\" like DVD, but this new one is definately a top 3 candidate for live performances. Sound is great, camera work is a top effort and the mixing is class. The boys are showing their age, Joe needs some fashion advice, but beyond that, you seriously cannot afford to miss this one!
B00001ODGR|5.0|The show was really great, not only was the sound quality superb but the performance was awesome.  These guys are old, but you wouldn't know it from looking at them.  They all run around the stage and belt-out some quality tunes.  In '81, the Paradise Theatre was a master-piece.  This film truly captures the power and talent that went into making that album, along with several other tracks from some other awe-inspiring albums.
B0001MDP3G|4.0|Anthony Minghella directs this tale based on the best-selling book about wounded Civil War soldier Inman (Jude Law) making the long, treacherous journey to his home in Cold Mountain, N.C. Along the way, he thinks of his love, Ada (Nicole Kidman), who has fought for sanity and her father's farm's survival while Inman has been gone, even with a brave young drifter named Ruby (Renee Zellweger, in an Oscar-winning performance) there to lend a hand.
0312323859|5.0|I read \\"Something Borrowed\\" first, and I have to say I did not particularly care for Darcy at all.  I thought she was the most simple minded, materialistic character I have seen portrayed in a long time.  In \\"Something Blue\\" I just couldn't believe that she thought she had no fault what-so-ever with her relationship with Dex, hello Marcus and baby ring a bell.  However as I kept reading I began to feel bad for her as you can tell she doesn't have anyone around her who really cares about her- even Ethan and Annalise kinda run to the hills.  By the end of the book I was in tears because I was soo happy for her. It was also good how Rachel was brought into this book and the role that she took behind the scenes and in Darcy's mind.  It is a sweet book of someone coming to realize that life is not simply about everyone loving you because you are \\"Darcy\\" but about life being simply about you.
B000000WFF|2.0|While the cd appears to be new.  There was no cover jacket in the cd?  That is unfortunate as i don't have that information.  I am not sure I will order again.  That shouldn't have happened.
B00005JLT5|5.0|This movie is spectacular. The movie was about a talented Jewish pianist whose career was suddenly disrupted by world war II. He got separated from his family;then, he precariously encountered such treacherous events that almost ended his life... This movie is not intended for viewers who have short attention span beacuse the movie lasted for almost three hours...However,I truly enjoyed this movie even though I don't usually watch movies that lasts more than two hours because almost every scene in this movie was quite riveting !!!!! This is unlike any hollocaust movie you have ever seen.
0316172324|3.0|Although I was able to power through this enjoyable book in a few short sittings, it left me a little disappointed.  Blink's subject  matter of our brain's powerful capability to make split-second decisions is thought provoking, but I found some of the treatments a little shallow.  The book feels like Gladwell found an introductory college cognitive psychology text and decided to write a 250-page magazine article about its most interesting bits.  Despite its shallowness, this is engaging and enjoyable soft non-fiction.  A perfect beach or vacation read!
B0007Y08QA|5.0|This film is an effective, neo-Hitchcockian thriller that follows the spooky life of Trevor (Christian Bale)as he goes from his job as a machinist to hanging out at a midnight diner at night. We find out that he has been suffering from chronic insomnia for the better part of a year which has had devastating physical effects on him. Essentially, Trevor has become a walking skeleton who finds it increasingly difficult to seperate fantasy and reality, especially when he encounters a mysterious co-worker named Ivan whom no one but he seems able to see. Again, this is a eerie and effective film.
B00005JL78|5.0|My wife & I are not big sci-fi fans, but we really enjoyed \\"Minority Report\\". The story, the action, and the hi-tech gadgets are all great. Tom Cruise is effective in the lead role and we can actually forget that he is Tom Cruise and just enjoy his character! A fun ride from beginning to end.
B00005B36H|5.0|First of all, if Lord Chimp ever happens to read this, I want to let you know your review of this album was amazing. You put to words my exact feelings about Lateralus. Good job. That being said, all I'll say that he hasn't is that Tool's latest and hopefully not their last album, is their best. By far and wide. And that is saying ALOT, considering the band.  <br />My favourite track is Lateralus. A 9 and a half minute listening experiance that honest to God, brings me close to tears every time I hear it, it's that good!!  <br />Along with Nirvana and Nine Inch Nails, I think Tool is the most ingenuis rock band of the last two decades. Danny Carey's drumming is so amazing it can't be put to words. (Although, Lord Chimp does a pretty good job)  <br />As good as A Perfect Circle is, I hope Maynard never jeopardizes Tool for it. I can't imagine rock music without them.
B00068NVI4|3.0|I loved the Yes-symphonic tour DVD in Ansterdam - better sound quality. Keys DVD was also better. I love Yes and all the great music. This DVD does have some great moments especially between Steve Howe and Rick Wakeman dualing. The filming is good and interesting. The acoustic set was good because the mixing was different. The sound for the electronic set was not so great.  I hope they release a live CD so I can hear how it should sound. Can't wait for the Live Word Set.    God bless - Jesus is the answer - relationship not religion. Talk to him and see! \\"If you believe... I'll crush the chains that bind and make you feel you're born again...\\"    RWB
0743487583|5.0|This book goes beyond a \\"classic\\".  Many of the classics I have read have felt out dated, trite, or just plain boring but Frankenstein is not one of those classics.  I've read a number of amazing classics too, but I was blown away by this novel.  With all the renditions of Frankenstein in movie form none do this book justice.<br /><br />Fantastic!
B0002TX4QQ|5.0|I started reading this book and read about a fourth of it and hated it.  Then it got much better and I really liked it.   I was very surprised at the ending and have passed it on to a friend and told others what a great read it was.  I highly recommend it to anyone.  I must have read for eight hours on Saturday just to finish it.  Excellent.

B000002OG5|5.0|Last night my wife & I happened to watch The Godfather on Bravo and the music was the element that really captivated me.  When I first saw this movie, I was 9 years old in 1972, on a family vacation, and my very conservative 2nd generation Italian-American parents, completely unaware of the subject matter of the film, thought this an excellent film for the family to watch...  Yet, looking back, and feeling the loss of grandparents, great aunts and uncles, the diaspora across America of my first and second cousins, lost in the melting pot, the score for the Godfather reminds me of a time of my own innocence, of a time when large family gatherings were the norm, when every Sunday evening meant hour long haircuts by my 85 year old grandfather and delicious Italian meals cooked by my 70 year old great aunt.  It took a long time to accept the loss of family as one by one that generation died off in the 1970's, to realize that life was not going to be a cocoon of large, warm, loving family relations.  Yet, way back in 1972, this magnificent, mournful music presaged that tragic realization that life in America was no longer going to be so cozy for those who choose complete assimilation into the melting pot.  The fictional Corleone family were Sicilian; my own were Neapolitan & Barese, but for anyone of southern Italian heritage, whether on the mainland or Sicily there is a chill of genetic resonance and recognition when you hear Rota's haunting mix of Neapolitan & Sicilian sounds and rhythms.  It's the motherland calling, the soul yearning, ignorant of the original grievances that caused the rift that sent whole communities and solo immigrants to the shore of a new world that was often no warmer a welcome mat than the hidebound, superstitious and vendetta-plagued hilltop farming communities they sought to escape from.  Tears of what...joy? or tears of sorrow demand to be exuded from my being when I hear this film score, crying for a warm, fuzzy fantasy of youth, yes, but one that did indeed contain the seeds of my being, and the cocoon of loving family that sheltered me in my growing years.  Let me call these tears of joy and appreciation for Francis Ford Coppola and Nino Rota for awakening in me the dormant love of an ancient homeland with many faults, but big enough to give birth to those who gave life to me.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|This is my personal favorite DT album (don't care what anyone says). you have great guitar solos from John Petrucci, great bass lines from John Myung, great vocals from James LaBrie, good drumming from Mike Portnoy, and amazing keyboard work from Jordan Rudess. The best songs on this album are \\"The Root Of All Evil\\", \\"Panic Attack\\", and the title track. This is a must buy for true DT fans.<br /><br />PS, 3.5 stars????????????? This is a joke, right?
B0000844I8|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, it was the first sci-fi movie I ever watched.  A good blend of sci-fi and action.
B0001LJC2K|5.0|The melodies, lyrics, great piano, and classical samples on this album meshed perfectly. Its true that the vocal pitch gets very high at times, but it builds tension and energy. If you like Thom York and Mattew Hales then the singer's voice shouldn't bother you. I wish someone had recommended this band to me sooner, I'm eager to listen to their other releases.
0778321606|1.0|I have to say that this book came highly recommended by some ladies in my knitting group. For me it was a painful read. The dialogue was simplistic and the plot was predictable. Macomber's characters are lame and outdated. I do not recommend this book for anyone who wishes to be challenged intellectually or emotionally. I gave it one star only because there is a knitting pattern in the book.
B000002O4S|4.0|The sound quality isn't as good as a regular CD.  Also, when you put it in the CD player/computer it doesn't play at the same volume as the rest of your music.  However, it has all of the great songs from the movie.  In terms of songs, it's a great pick, but the sound quality isn't the best.  In the end, I am still glad that I bought it though.  There are a few orchestral tracks, but it has the Huey Lewis and the News songs as well as the songs from the Enchantment Under the Sea dance.  Good Stuff.  Love that Movie.  If you don't have the movies i recommend just getting the trilogy b/c they're all excellent.
B00080ZG10|3.0|I felt like I had been robbed of 3 hours of my life. Like the spruce goose this movie barely manages to take off only to go back down shortly after. I watched this film with a group of friends, none of whom are action junkies, and by the time it was over I was the only one still awake to turn the DVD player off. Avoid this movie unless you want a lengthy biography of Howard Huges, but I personally enjoyed the actual biography more
B000002H33|5.0|I feel that this album is their best album. This album has great guitar solos from Kirk Hammet, great bass from Cliff Burton (R.I.P.),good singing/lyrics and rhythm guitar work from James Hetfield, and some actual good drumming from Lars Ulrich. The best song on this album is by far the title track. If you like metal, this album is definitely a must-have.<br /><br />R.I.P. Cliff Burton
B000002LCX|5.0|By the time The Smiths released Strangeways, here we come in 1987 (strangely the same year as U2's US breakthrough The Joshua Tree) the band had already parted company, and it wasn't until nearly a year after the albums release that the press even knew that the band were no more, this at the time not only stunned their now established cult following but the music press too. They'd only released four official studio albums (including two b side albums Hatful of Hollow, and The World won't listen, in the US Louder than bombs was released as a double LP combining both versions) and were considered on the of the best bands of the time, if not the best!!!! <br /> <br />Strangeways, here we come continues the bands or really Morrisey's familiar formular of combining stress with humour into a musical melody. In truth the sound was different but the feel was very Smiths, not that it made Strangeways a bad album, no way, hence the five stars, it just means it is their weakest effort, but there has to be one hasn't there???? <br /> <br />Actually the album does have some untypical Smiths tracks and if anything, these songs proove that the Smiths were possibly heading to some different direction, A Rush and a Push and the land is ours is about the fight for Irish freedom from the British, I Started Something I couldn't finish, I am sure inspired the Gallagher Brothers of Oasis, hence why they have such an admiration for The Smiths. Whilst I can imagine all the members of Coldplay listening to Death of a Disco Dancer one day together around a table and saying \\"That's the sound we want to create!!!\\"  <br /> <br />But the Smiths also keep to their own familar formular as well as the new one, Girlfriend in a Coma is classic Smiths, and is no suprise it was released as a single in the UK, it would peak at 12. Whilst Stop me if you've heard this one before is a typical humerous Smiths love song with one of the cleverist lines of all time \\"I still love you, but only slightly less than I used to.\\" Whilst the very serious Last night I dreamt somebody loved Me turned out to be The Smiths final single release it the UK, peaking at 30!!! <br /> <br />Unhappy Birthday is another great Morrisey gimmick \\"I've come to wish you an unhappy birthday cos you're evil\\" and is the kind of song we'd all love to sing in tribute to our worst enemy at their birthday (for a joke naturally!!) <br /> <br />Whilst Paint a Vulgar Picture, about a failed musician, who Morrisey has a fancy too, is an elequent song, and like most of the album has some powerful lyrical moment \\"This was your life but you could of said no if you wanted too!!!\\" <br /> <br />Death at ones Elbow, turns out to be the weakest on the album, and most desturbing, as it seems to lean on Morrisey's gay side, whilst I won't share you though sounding depressing is the funniest addiction song ever, where Morrisey admits that he's addicted too...perrier (that's sparkling water!!!) <br /> <br />Overall Strangeways, here we come is a great listen, and it would peak at 2 in the UK, and remains to this date their most sucessful US chart entry at 55. So ok it's not their best, and I'd hardly recommend it over The Queen is Dead, but there is a favourite saying of mine... <br />Smiths worst studio album = Other bands best album!!! <br /> <br />ENOUGH SAID!!!!!
6305508550|5.0|EASILY the best corporate comedy ever written, hands down. I venture to say it is one of the funniest comedies ever put on the silver screen. The satirical spoofs in this movie are done so well that I literally laugh in my cubical, relating characters in the movie to ACTUAL people at work. Even if you are not one who buys DVDs, (like myself) this is easily a must have. The show gets funnier everytime you watch it...especially when you can walk through those corporate doors M-F and see it in action on a regular basis in real-time, in real-life, on a daily basis in some shape or form. You really have to see this movie at least three times to appreciate its brilliance.
B000A88F22|5.0|Unlike every other high-quality, manufactured \\"reality\\" television show out there, CHAOTIC is raw and real. The show gives what it promises: an up-close, exclusive look at Britney's life, without the glamour and the fame. The footage is filmed by Britney Spears and Kevin Federline themselves. And there is also a commentary of both of them, done by UPN. It's quite sad that critics bashed this show so much, because it was never given a chance. The first episode was not a very good example of the how the show really was. It gets much better as it goes on. And of course, the DVD has bonus footage and the video for the beautiful song, \\"Someday (I Will Understand)\\". <br /> <br />It is worth the buy!
B00005JKN9|3.0|<br />Whenever I see a Scorsese film I feel like I'm on a date with a dumb blonde or a cardboard cut out of a super model. Simply because the movie is well directed, well cast, historically accurate and well acted, does not make good movies. Good movies have this thing called a plot which tries to draw you in to some kind of struggle the characters are involved in. \\"But the characters are involved in a huge struggle, it starts off with a  street brawl\\" yet this whole struggle manages to take a backseat during the entire film's 166 minute runtime. Which ends climatically with DiCaprio (who I can't stand either) watching his arch nemesis die to a misplaced cannon ball during a race riot. This whole time I was waiting for him to kill the guy and then in the end they just cop out. I was frothing at the mouth from vindication... What Scorsese does is take a film that really is only an hour long and stretch it out a needlessly long period of time. Like all his films he gives us a good picture of someone's life or a period of time with some semblance of a story stretch out over twice the time.   <br />
B000002TQV|5.0|Forget OK Computer: The Bends is Easily, EASILY, Radiohead's best album - and one of the genuine all-time classic records of the rock'n'roll era. Of the late 'nineties British Invasion, only this record - and maybe Massive Attack's Mezzanine - deserve to be mentioned in the same breath as Exile on Main Street and Revolver.<br /><br />In releasing The Bends Radiohead was grappling with potential one-hit wonderdom in the shape of a comedy track from an otherwise forgettable first album. They only got away with Pablo Honey at all because of Creep, clearly realised they couldn't afford to indulge themselves second time around and, through the bittersweet passage of The Bends they simply didn't. Thom Yorke revealed himself as an angry, ironic and thoughtful young chap with a ripper falsetto (launching in the process a most surprising, and awfully British, new genre of pop star, the Politically-Aware Ironic Former Chorister) and the two or three Radiohead guitar players demonstrated that not only could they come in on time after all, but they could play some pretty meaty chops too. There are some great, great songs on the Bends; at times it rocks, it swaggers, and at others it sits quietly under a tree and sings about plastic surgery. Super.<br /><br />I would tend to disregard Pablo Honey, and see OK Computer as the difficult second album, making the Bends Radiohead's first, and only truly great album. What on earth they were thinking after that, lord only knows.<br /><br />Olly Buxton
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is a fantastic series. Better than anything out there right now. The characters are great, the setting is interesting, and the writing is fun.
B00005JLD4|5.0|I originally saw this film in our local theater and left singing its praises.  I recommended Rabbit Proof Fence to every friend I have, and I think the DVD does a worthy job of bringing the film to the small screen.<br /><br />In addition to the film itself, the DVD has only a few special features.  The most moving by far was the behind-the-scenes documentary.  At one point, they show how filming the scenes of the girls being ripped away from their mothers affected the entire cast and crew.  Clearly, this film didn't only touch its audience but everyone involved in making it.<br /><br />See the movie; buy the DVD.  It's a must-have for anyone whose collection includes thoughtful, thought-provoking works.
B000059ZLH|5.0|Todo el disco \\"scenes from a memory\\" interpretado excelentemente. <br />Algunos extras incluyendo la cancion de 25min \\"A change of seasons\\". Lamentablemente no esta todo el concierto, deberian haberlo hecho dvd doble o algo asi ya que  se hecha de menos algunas partes incluidas en los 3cds. Pero bueno recomiendo este producto 100% para los fans de Dream Theater.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Of course this is a fabulous show, no doubts there.  But I have had a lot of problems getting my hands on a complete set of DVDs.   <br /> <br />I bought two copies (one at Best Buy and one at FYE).  The first set was completely missing Disk 4.  The case was there but when I opened it up to watch it - no disk!  The second set had two Disk 3's.  After returning them to the respective stores, I've ordered it online and am hoping that I will eventually get to see Disk 4. <br /> <br />I have never had a problem purchasing a DVD set before and it's now happened to me twice.  So I'm posting to warn others to be sure and check to make sure all their DVDs are accounted for.  Very strange.
B0000AOV85|4.0|It is very good but I already have this DVD, what I wanted was a Dark Side of the Moon in concert.  So if know of one I would be obliged.  Regards, Douglas.
B0007GAERG|5.0|Mariah Carey:<br /><br />Who is this? The resurrection of Mariah Carey, who in my opinion never died, was one of the most prolific happenings of 2005 in the realm of music. Forget the hype on any other album you have heard this year if there was ever one worth buying instead of downloading, this album is the one.  To say that Ms. Carey showcases her voice in its completeness is an understatement. The most notable thing about this album besides Ms Carey is the abundance of talent she has employed to make what this critiquer says is the best album of the year.<br /><br />In love with every song, I hopped in my 97' white blazer, I know, I know, it is what it is, wondering why the volume control wouldn't go loud enough to bump this CD and hence I could not without competitive possession of a stereo, do Ms. Carey and the eminent forces on this CD justice. I felt 19 in the mood to look cool, say cool things, amalgamate my soul into the melodies that encompassed the whole of this album. Reluctant to skip any songs in fear that I might miss out on the greatness that was the Emancipation of MIMI, and with her I am now released and possess another great CD in my collection of few greats.<br /><br />leedixon
B000286SCO|5.0|Esta bien entretenido. Solo deberia tener un poco mas de orden. <br />Por el resto lo recomiendo para los fans.

B0000029AP|4.0|This waz the first Aerosmith CD I got, and I love it. if you are new to aerosmith, I would reccomend this CD or \\"Rocks\\" <br /> <br />Toys In The Attic - 10/10 - The title track of this CD, its one of the best on the CD. <br /> <br />Uncle Salty - 8/10 - Good opening riffs, but not as good as the first track. <br /> <br />Adam's Apple - 8/10 - An OK song. Maybe an 8 and a half. <br /> <br />Walk This Way - 10/10 - One of Aerosmith's best songs, and not only of this CD, one of their best songs period.  <br /> <br />Big Ten Inch Record - 9/10 - unlike anything Aerosmith has done before, sort of a combination of blues and rock. Its pretty good. <br /> <br />Sweet Emotion - 10/10 - very popular Aerosmith song. Mostly everyone has heard this song before, and it's really good, even though overplayed on the radio.  <br /> <br />No More No More - 10/10 - GREAT SONG.  <br /> <br />Round And Round - 8/10 - This is where the album gets weaker. This and \\"You See Me Crying\\" is probably the reason for the 4 star rating of this CD. <br /> <br />You See Me Crying - 7/10 - A slower song, not necessarily bad, but weaker and worse than the rest of the songs.  <br /> <br />As I mentioned before, if you're new to Aerosmith I would definately get this or \\"Rocks.\\" You will not be disappointed. Peace.
B000929AJQ|1.0|Trent has gone the way of music that sounds and looks edgy and hard but is highly polished and non-threatening. You can hear this kind of music in the more hip SUV and luxury car commercials. This is the tremendous downside to being overly-perfectionistic and using very sophistocated studios; sad, but true. His lyrcism has him sounding developmentally stunted since he's still singing about things 15 year olds complain about. Trent also tends to reuse the same terminology in his titles and phrasings which make for redundant sentiments. I really wish he'd delve back into Prince-tinged sexuality like he did on his first three albums; that's where a lot of NIN's meat was. Sadly, Reznor's music seem's pretty neutered now, tepidly wallowing in a pedestrian haze of Pro-Tools and overemphasized insecurity.<br /><br />Though Nine Inch Nails may have always been a pop band, it is no longer the innovative force it once was. Trent & co. sound more like an \\"industrial\\" sampler act for those whose boundries begin and end with MTV and MTV2, mixing a little rock, a little light electronics and little pop to create a nice package for casual music fans.
B00004WC6J|5.0|If you don't like the artist for whatever reason don't bother <br />with a review. David Sylvian is one of the most unique artists past or present. I love his work and really respect him as a musician and person for that matter. This compilation will not please everyone and is intended for \\"new\\" listeners as an introduction to David's talent, after all a true fan will already have these tracks found on his various cd's and other recordings. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
B000002HFU|5.0|This is a classic underground New york album of the mid 90's its going going to be very hard for a lot of people to understand the relevance if it period even if you are from the NY.<br /><br />Definatly a vibe album, surprisingly more white boys will probably appreciate this album these days than young black kids. Black music is at an all time low in quality right now,(southern rap) but anyway ...yes this is a classic.  P.s.  (i'm Black)
B000002ARV|2.0|The album is too short, mainly due to the duration of each song. Only 12 titles. Need to review personal objectives prior to purchasing.
B00005JN4H|1.0|I ordered the original French version of this movie and got this version instead, due to the supplier's mistake. I watched it nonetheless and it was a horrible, painful experience.  <br /> <br />The screenplay is absolutely rubbish and the comedic timing is ridiculously bad. The skits, humour and jokes are SOOOOO formulaic, that you would have to deliver the lines to perfection for them to work, but Fellon and Latifah fail miserably.  <br /> <br />If not for Giselle Bundchen this film would not even be worthy of 1 star! Save your money and rent/buy the French version which is a cult classic.
0553573403|4.0|I thought this book would be something like lord of the rings, but its not. its really good. You'll never once say \\"I knew that would happen.\\"<br /><br />If you want different, captivating, than this is the book for you. I give it only 4 stars becuase it was so long and there are 5 more books after this, and that is annoying to me, anyway.
B0002GTWYW|5.0|Great album when it came out great now, the warning video ive seen, still a good buy for young cats not up on B.I.G
B000002VCE|4.0|Great, for those who love good southern hard rock from the 70's. Could have been top 5 stars if remix was of better quality : not all guitars can be listened to distinctly !!
B00003CXTG|1.0|Even if a movie is cheesy, there is good sort of cheesiness and there is the bad kind. This is definitely very, very bad cheese. If not for their very good marketing campaign and Kate Beckinsale, I wouldn't have watched this, but hey - who can resist Kate. <br /> <br />Sadly this movie is an utter waste of time. Ben Affleck is easily one of the worst actors at the moment, the dialogue is gut-wrentchingly bad and the screenplay equally atrocious. <br /> <br />I don't understand how Hollywood keeps forgetting that what ppl want is a good story.

0895260131|5.0|I am awed at the moronic one star rating reviewers on this book--these are obviously people who have an agenda. IF this book was against Christianity and Judaism those reviewers would no doubt applaud the book. They are that twisted! I've read this book and then went and bought the best English translation of the Hadith and Qu'ran I could get (translated by Muslims not western scholars).  And I can honestly say that the author Spencer is correct in his study of this anti-life religion/philosophy especially about Jihad which has ALWAYS been part of Islam. Islam grew quickly taking over the Arabic pennisula and later other lands in the middle east because (unlike Christ and Moses or Buddha for that matter) Mohummad was a warrior who took over by force lands and gave people a choice: \\"convert of die\\".  Sorry to disappoint  \\"Raymond\\" of San Diego who says \\"Christians and Jews lived in peace under muslims in spain\\"--THAT is a deceptive gloss over of a rule which oppressed the freedom of those people and brought secret executions to thousands who wouldnt bend the knee to Islam (or pay the 'infidal' tax which muslim rulers charged any nonmuslims they allowed to live). That is living in peace??  I guess the black slavery trade when those slaves didnt act up was 'living in peace' under their South masters too huh?  Oh and by the way when the muslims took over Asia Minor ask the 2 million Armenians (and others) they slaughetered and millions of Greeks (later in the 1920s--was covered in National Geographic magazine) they killed and exiled if \\"Islam is peaceful\\". And that is just one example. Meanwhile Christ said for his followers: \\"treat others as you want them to treat YOU\\" (if you have problems with that statment and just 'hate' Christianity you truly are a sick person! )<br />Spencer clearly shows that its NOT that arabs etc are bad people but Islam is a religion with a venomous poison center. This book is ONLY for the brave at heart sorry to disappoint all you blind guides of the blind out there. Spencer has presented a truly courageous survey of Islam and its beliefs. Oh and he is not 'biased' he tells it like it is regarding the Crusades etc. This man is a scholar --listen to him!of the blind out there.

020161622X|5.0|Every programmer should be required to read this book.  Junior programmers should read it (at least) annually until they fully understand it.  I've been a programmer for 10 years.  1/2 of the book reinforced ideas I alredy held.  The cooresponding copy should help me to educate those with whom I've typically battled over such concepts (managers, marketing, other programmers).  1/8 of the book validated some theory I've wanted to test; 1/8 seemed as though it might not directly apply to the language I program in most often; 1/4 just about blew my mind.  The 15 or so hours I spent reading this book was some of the best time spent for me, education-wise over the last 2 years.  I literally couldn't sleep the night I finished it thinking about implementing some of the ideas expressed within.  To the authors: Thank you.

B0002Y4TM4|5.0|I've been a captivated Marillion fan since I heard 'Seasons End' all those years ago. For me they've never made a less than brilliant album in their long career, including pre Hogarth albums. In short, I agree with everything manuel Hernandez wrote in the previous review about this album but would like to add that if you are enthralled by this album as I am, you need to get the 'MARBLES ON THE ROAD' DVD as well. The live performance from Steve Hogarth adds a depth of emotion, drama and humour that you can't get from the CD alone.
0670451495|5.0|This is a wonderful, timeless children's tale.  The story is engaging, the art is delightful.  I loved this book when I was small, and I give it constantly to all of the children in my life.  Every parent who knew the book growing up is delighted to see it again, and the parents who are discovering it for the first time all enjoy it.  This is a book you can read to children over and over and never tire of.
B000000WJ2|4.0|Recorded with the same band that backed Keith Richards on 1988's \\"Talk Is Cheap\\", \\"Main Offender\\" is more of the same no-frills guitar-driven rock n' roll.  It's not quite as consistent as its predecessor, perhaps, but \\"Main Offender\\" offers a handful of really great, tough rock n' rollers, like the #3 single \\"Wicked As It Seems\\", the driving \\"Will But You Won't\\" and the low-key \\"Hate It When You Leave\\". The Rolling Stones should play more of this kind of straight-ahead unassuming rock n' roll.    The best songs here are tighter and more focused than the ones on \\"Talk Is Cheap\\", and Richards' vocals are some of his best on record...check out the lean, mean riff-rockers \\"Eileen\\" and \\"Runnin' Too Deep\\", two of his best songs. And the production is excellent, clear and uncluttered without being slick or glossy.  There is a bit of filler here, sure, but fans of the Human Riff will definitely find this album worth their while. Songs like \\"Words Of Wonder\\", \\"Demon\\" and \\"999\\" may not leap right out and grab you by the throat, but Keith Richards sings and plays as well as he ever did, and \\"Main Offender\\" will grow on you if you give it half a chance.

0694003611|5.0|\\"Goodnight Moon\\" appears to be a simple children's book on the surface, but it is so much more! When my daughter was 2 or 3, we got this wonderful little treasure to read before she went to bed each night. The simple poetry is easy to memorize, and the illustrations are gentle and comforting. But as the pages turn, time passes in the bunny's room - the clock advances, the moon rises, the light in the room dims - all in preparation for tucking the bunny in for the night. The little mouse moves about the room, making for a wonderful game of \\"where's the mouse\\"! If you look closely at the pictures on the wall and the books in the bookcase, you realize you've seen them before in other classic Helen Wise Brown books like \\"The Runaway Bunny\\". What a treat for the senses, and what a wonderful way to introduce reading to your child.
B00005B4GU|4.0|For some reason, people rate this album as one of the least purchasable Radiohead albums and compare it poorly to Kid A. I disagree with this. On the contrary, I find Kid A pompous pretentious and lacking substance, Amnesiac on the other hand being a finer much better achievement. At last, there are actually songs and its good to hear Thom Yorke's unique voice again, the electronic pieces are much more deconstructed and the jazzy experimentation is great. <br />True, Amnesiac is a puzzle with missing pieces but I find it much easier to listen than to the overrated \\"Kid A\\" and \\"Hail of the Thief\\". I don't know, I guess I am different but Amnesiac is one my faves. <br />My highlights: <br />the beautiful \\"pyramid song\\" <br />\\"Pulk/pull\\" (who ever thoguht Radiohead could do work as deconstructed as this?) <br />\\"you and whose army\\" <br />\\"i might be wrong\\" (its got a good rhythm) <br />\\"hunting bears\\" (fantastic interlude) <br />\\"like spinning plates\\" (paranoid, chlostrophobic, reminds me a bit of Mezzanine but with Thom Yorke's gorgeous singing) <br />\\"life in a glasshouse\\" ( you want some brass? this is 10000 times better than \\"The National Anthem\\". This song is probably one of the best \\"endings\\" Radiohead have ever done)

B0000VAFO0|5.0|OK!I know this movie is about Vampires vr. Werewolfs with dark settings and lots of action, BUT everyone should knows that this is more like anime parody than a normal action movie. <br /> <br />The main anime productions that inspired this movie were BATTLE ANGEL and BIOHUNTER (just mix them together and you will have  this).  <br />There are another animes that also inspired the movie like Vampire Hunter D, Escaflowne and Wicked City but those were not the main ones. Just watch BIOHUNTER and BATTLE ANGEL and you will   know of what Im talking about.  <br />Of course! Im only talking about the productions, the story and the acting are different.  <br /> <br />If you like anime parodies then check out this ones: <br />* Matrix Revolutions (One of the very best). <br />* Animatrix. <br />* Kill Bill. <br />* Guyver 2. <br />* Blade (this one have very little \\"rip-offs\\" but there are very notable). <br />* Power Rangers (THE WORST PARODY EVER).      <br /> <br />ADIOS.

B00004XONN|2.0|After the massive hit that was \\"OK Computer\\" Radiohead decide to surprise listeners even further by relasing this surrealist conceptual \\"dark side of the moon\\" fourth album of theirs named \\"Kid A\\". Unfortunately, instead of constructing more beautiful music, they achieve this somewhat unfocused unaccomplished kerfuffle of ideas that has in the least, absolutely nothing to do with them. The really dissapointing part is that there is hardly any melody in any of the songs save for the gorgeous but opressing \\"how to disapear completely\\" and the depressing \\"motion picture soundtrack\\". That's already 2 songs. The rest is just bulls***.  The opener \\"Everything in its right place\\" sounds like a guy discovering midi instruments and recording baby voices. A fun track but for an opening  surprise, a poor achievement. The next track, Kid A, is unnoticeable, in fact I often skip it.On it, Thom's singing, if you can call that singing, is hardly comprehensible. I heard the lyrics were something to do about \\"rats and children\\". It's a shame because the idea of computerised music was good but it should have built up to a climax, instead of dwelling nowhere for 4 minutes. The next song, \\"National Anthem\\", one of the highlights of Kid A does however build up to a climax.This un-anthem starts off with a beat similar to \\"Talk show host\\", for those who have seen the recent Romeo and Juliet, and kicks off with a funky bass, Thom sings \\"everyone around here, everyone is so near , what's going on?\\" , the rhythm keeps going, Thom repeats the same words, then brass kicks in, slowly building to an explosive chaos of trumpets screaming, then stopping, and screaming again.It ends with a distorted real \\"national anthem\\" in the background and finally stops there... In other words, what the f***?     \\"How to disappear\\" is a beautiful piece, the highlight of Kid A and clearly sounds like it could have been on OK Computer, or belongs to \\"post-OK Computer\\", the visions of a buried world clearly arising out of the fading in and out violins and brass that have forever replaced what was once guitars..It is beautiful imagery although the song doesn't hit you quite the same way as the similar \\"Lucky\\" did. After five minutes of lament about non-existence, the piece dissolves into an insturmental atmospheric \\"Eno\\" esque 4 minute piece of peaceful organ and synths, sounding like a track that could be found on any music to relax at home in your bath, but unfortunately nothing much more. Three minutes, four notes. In other words, compared to how far Radiohead have gone before, another what the f***?  After this comes the earthy \\"optimistic\\", where Thom Yorke actually sings, at last, but not very interestingly. He sounds like a genius who understands everyting about the world and the lyrics are kind of simplistic: \\"big fish eat the little ones\\" and \\"animal farms\\". I just don't know why this track is called optimistic, because it feels very neutral, very observational. A great track to promote nature. Musically, though it is not bad for it actually sees the band playing together, but in terms of depth it could have been a better song. For instance rather than adding organs, they should have kept doing something with guitars, and maybe doing something like Paranoid Android, by speeding up, building up to a climax and slowing down again, you know doing something, dammit. That's what's strongly missing in Kid A: climax. I wish there was one song that got to the top, that was worth listening to but even the \\"national anthem\\" dsoesn't do it for me.  After changing into a soft \\"dasnce\\" track for one minute \\"Optimistic\\" becomes \\"In limbo\\", an intertwined combination of guitar arpeggios, synth loops, and light drumming with Thom humming soft words such as \\"I lost my way\\", \\"trap doors that open wide\\". This song flows well but its not a song, really, it's more like an interlude between \\"otimistic\\" and the next track, the raw and aggressive \\"idioteque\\" kicking off with pounding beats,hardcore electronic chords (that have the same effect as if guitars were there). Its a great piece but the irritating beats, synth noises along with Thom's irritating singing and convoluted voices, make it almost impossible to listen to enjoyably. That's track no 8 by the way so there' only 2 more songs. \\"Morning Bell\\" follows. Thom is very plaintive there and the depressing feeling that its the end soon takes over so strongly that by the time \\"Motion picture soundtrack\\" arrives, you just can't stand it. It is downright suicidal stuff. Way too depressing for me.   As you see, Kid A does not have a lot to offer for me. Some people say this is \\"artistic\\" music. It may very well be, but it is still one of the Radiohead albums I least enjoy listening to, and I think it is highly overrated.    The fact that it was released as an album rather than an-ep is hard to digest, because all inall there is only about four or five songs on Kid A, the rest being interludes, or experimental aqttempts.I guess If I knew Radiohead were releasing an e-p called \\"Kid A\\" and sold it as an e-p not an album, then I would consider it to have probably been a nearby masterpiece.
B0000542D2|5.0|The natural charisma and explosive talent of the early Beatles comes through with fine British character actors like Wilfrid Brambell (playing Pauls incorrigible grandfather), providing comic support. This contagious romp remains the freshest, most breathtaking of musical rides. Highlight: the spontaneous jam session of I Should Have Known Better in a train compartment. The perfect  introduction to Beatlemania for your kids.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer bursted onto the music scene in 2001 with \\"Room For Squares.\\" His major label debut has Mayer playing the role of singer/songwriter, writing dities about making love (\\"Your Body is a Wonderland\\"), creating your own way of living (\\"No Such Thing\\"), the overrated freedom of singlehood (\\"Happy St. Patricks Day\\"), long distance relationships (\\"3 x 5\\"), saying something stupid (\\"My Stupid Mouth\\"), and the smooth jazz moves of \\"Why Georgia Why\\" and \\"Neon\\". Mayer seems to keep his sense of humor intact, providing some moments of tongue in cheek during his songs which make them more refreshing and fun to listen to. The lite rock background could be sleep inducing to some who like music a little harder, but Mayer is obviously aimming for an adult contemporary audience with this album. While some might take pot-shots at Mayers Dave Matthews-like voice, his strong songwriting and more emphasis on R & B/jazz rock, compared to Matthews infusion of worldly influences and blues to his rock and jazz background, make Mayer stand firmly on his own. Pick up a copy of this album if you are looking for something to unwind to after a long day, background music, or an album to sing along with.
B00005JG6Q|4.0|In recent TIME magazine article movie critic Richard Corliss listed both of Otomo's major movies Steamboy and Akira as among the top five animes available on DVD. My interest in Akira arose from my viewing of his newest movie Steamboy and all I heard about Akira being THE anime movie. <br />The one thing that stands out about Otomo is his ability to create two movies with 180 degree difference in ambiance that deal with the same underlying issue of the consequences of man trying to invent breakthrough technologies when his fallen state prevents the proper use of this technology and the catastrophic consequences of this failure. <br />The main plot of Akira, if you can call it that, centers around two members of a biker gang, Kaneda the leader of the gang and the younger brother type figure Tetsuo, that run rampant on the streets of dystopic post-apocalyptic Neo-Tokyo. Neo-Tokyo borrows heavily from Ridley Scott's vision of LA in Blade Runner with magnificent sky scrapers and neon but on the ground level is a city clearly in chaos with a seedy underbelly. Neo-Tokyo is run by corrupt politicians and is the subject of terrorist attacks from groups claiming to be fighting inequality and poverty caused by some \\"tax reform\\". The only thing keeping a resemblance of order in Neo-Tokyo is the military lead by Colonel Shikishima who exhibits the militaristic traits of pre-World War II Japan. The only sign of spiritual life in the city is a cult movement proclaiming the current order will be destroyed by the re-appearance of a messiah like figure named Akira. Tetsuo gets involved in an accident when a bizarre blue skin withered child appears. The military swoops in to take the child and Tetsuo away. Tetsuo is sent to a military hospital where his inactive psychic powers are awoken by medical experiments. He meets two other blue skin children who also have psychic powers. These children are analogous to the pre-cogs characters in the Phillip Dick short story adopted by Steven Spielberg in Minority Report.  Tetsuo uses his new power to escape from the hospital and starts to go on a bloody gory rampage through neo-Tokyo acting out on his resentment of life and him playing second fiddle to Kaneda. Kaneda along with the Colonel, the three pre-cog children, and a female terrorist name Kai try to stop Tetsuo before he awakens Akira and destroys Neo-Tokyo. The ending has to be seen to be believed. <br />Akira has been elevated as a cult classic in the US. Akira is considered the movie that propelled anime to the popularity it currently enjoys in the US. This movie represented a radical departure from the cartoonish TV shows like Speed Racer and Astroboy that were the only exposure Americans had to that time to anime. What propelled Akira's popularity was its kinetic often violent and bloody energy, mind bending plot, dystopic atmosphere, fluid animation, and tackling of metaphysical issue. There are some scenes in Akira that seem to be straight from the mind of a Salvador Dali in its surrealism. One thing to always keep mind is all the action one sees was done using hand drawn animation. Akira's has been a major influence in more mainstream movies, for example the Matrix trilogy. <br />Otomo's vision of Neo-Tokyo is amazing but after experiencing Ridley Scott's vision of LA I did not have the same sense of awe and curiosity. Almost all the characters in Akira are derivatives of some anti-hero and the high level of disturbing violence and surreal images in this movie taxes you. The experiments that led to Tetsuo becoming a psychic monster and the creation of Akira was an attempt to harness \\"the power of god.\\" I was reminded of Dune where the Bene Gesserit through selective breeding created the Kwisatz Haderach. Otomo spells out in the movie that the energy and knowledge from the moment of creation is genetically hard wired in every living being and this power can be unleashed with the use of science. Such Gnostic type theology is very unnerving to someone raised in a Catholic tradition although I can understand Otomo being Japanese sees nature and divinity much more tightly integrated than someone raised in the Western tradition. Another philosophical statement Otomo was trying to make was the cyclic nature of history with periods of destruction followed by reconstruction and renewal. Once again such a view of history is very different from the linear tradition in the Judeo-Christian West. The main overriding message Otomo delivers is how scientific advancement inevitably falls into the wrong hands sometimes by the scientists themselves who do not consider the ethical impact of what they are doing. The result of this human failure is wonton destruction. Of course, this suspicion of science is seared into the Japanese psyche from the dropping of the atomic bombs on Japan. Otomo argues that the only way to avoid the destructive consequences of technological advancement is to retain a child-like innocence. Otomo seems to subscribe to the 60s statement about not trusting anybody over 30.       <br />Does Akira deserve its place as a cult classic? Yes. This is one of the most original animation films in history. Did I find this movie an emotionally pleasing experience? No. My reactions to Akira is analogous to how I feel about modern art. With its kinetic energy and surreal images Akira can be considered a piece of modern art on film. The last time I was back in my hometown in the New York metro area, my mom and I went to the recently re-opened Museum of Modern Art (MOMA). As I walked around the galleries, on an intellectual level I can understand why the pieces displayed are important, how they represent feelings of angst in a world ravaged by two world wars, the elevation of materialism over the spiritual, the subconscious over the rational and how they represent a break with the past. But try as I may, I cannot connect to these pieces and Akira on an emotional level. Maybe you can call me a reactionary but when I experience the fine arts I want to be uplifted or be part of the world envisioned in the art. Otomo's Steamboy in its romanticism and nostalgic Victorian setting does that for me but the violent tormented Neo-Tokyo does not. There is enough angst in today's fast paced world where I have no desire to experience more of it in the fine arts.      <br />
0679720200|5.0|this book makes me tingle all over.  i'm glad to see that so many people have read this book, but i feel that many miss the point.  unlike many, i was not disturbed by this book.  i felt very comfortable with camus's writing and with the main character, meursault.  in fact, i completely fell in love with meursault.  to some (especially religous people, christians), his outlook on life was very frusterating.  but to me, it was mysterious and simple and i loved him for it.  meursault completely makes this book worthwhile.   <br /> <br />now that i have declared my love for meursault, i'll try to clarify things but this book is so profound it is sometimes hard to put into words.  first of all, meursault is no idiot.  the best way to describe meursault is that he just IS.  he never thinks of why or how, he just is, he just does.  his only motivations are physical needs and pleasures.  meursault is an existentialist, but he does not know that because a true existentialist would never say \\"i am an existentialist.\\"  they would never even give thought to such things, they just ARE, like meursault.   <br /> <br />meursault stands in contrast to society.  when he is on trial for killing the man, the courtroom represents society.  the trial is moreso a trial of meursault's morals and beliefs than the actual crime he committed.  if meursault had shown remorse, he probably would not have given the death penalty and he would have lived, but this would have resulted in society's defeat over meursault because he would have changed his ways for society.  during the trial meursault does show some confusion and frusteration and fear, a sign that society may win him.  however, in the end he accepts the indifference that he knows as the world and he knows it is who he is and it is ok.  for this he is given the death penalty, but for sticking to his views, he has won out over society.  in this way, he wins his trial. <br /> <br />i know that sounds confusing, but if you read the book, itwill make sense if you think deep enough.  also, note meursault's references to the sun and the heat.  these images play a constant role throughout the story.  <br /> <br />did anyone else note the similarities between this book and the movie garden state???

B0000AQVCL|5.0|If there is a new trend in music these days, it's the trend for bands to have a retro sound to them. Jet fits this mold with \\"Get Born.\\" Their sound is a mix of Beatles like pop/rock, Badfinger, and Kinks rolled into one. It's a great album to listen to, and it's a ton of fun to blast up and rock out to. Nothing groundbreaking, but pure fun.
B0000CAXIC|5.0|For the longest time, a fellow friend of mine had recommended the Foo Fighters to me as one of the best bands that has ever existed, that I would never get tired of them. A band that was full of energy, thought-provoking lyrics, and mind-numbing guitar riffs that took you on a ride that could only be described as \\"powerful\\".<br /><br />After hearing \\"In Your Honor\\", my interest was sparked a little, but soon I.Y.H. found its spot at the back of my CD shelf, and was superceded by several albums from the early 90s (I'm a huge alt/rock fan).<br /><br />One day I was watching a movie on a shady afternoon, and a song kicked in. \\"My goodness\\", I thought... \\"this song is awesome, I've got to figure out who it's by\\". As the credits rolled, the song was \\"My Hero\\" by none other than, the Foo. This brought me back to 1999, when I remembered that the Foo Fighters also came out with the song \\"Learn to Fly\\", as airplane pilots and dress ups or something along those lines. I said, yes, that's right... I liked all of these songs.<br /><br />I finally got around to picking up \\"The Colour and The Shape\\" (after mucho pestering by said friend). The experience that I had been given and the ride that had been in store for me could not be described in words. I was breathless. What had I been missing out on all these years?<br /><br />Instantly, I was time-warped back to the mid-to-late nineties. Back to the times when guitar-driven riffs and tear-jearking ballads were king of the airwaves. When talented songwriting and blinding hooks were more than abundant. When American Idol and Punk'd ceased to exist. I was brought back to a time of great music that I thought was buried far too deep to recover, far too lost to be found, and so forgotten that I seemed like one of the only musically-sane persons left on planet earth!<br /><br />And this album did it. This album is amazing. It's loud without making your ears bleed; agressive without screaming every word (though dave may come close in Monkey Wrench, but it fits!); and production that shines and stands out. This album sounds great to boot. Gil Norton is a genius.<br /><br />I have to say, even though Foo's \\"In Your Honor\\" did not impress me much, Colour&Shape brought me back the respect I always had for Foo long before I had forgotten they existed.<br /><br />If you're looking for classic Foo, this is where it's at.<br /><br />If you were disappointed with later albums, like IYH, this is where it's at.<br /><br />If you want to take an honest, hard look at what real music lived and breathed like in the 1990s, this is where it's at.<br /><br />Go get your copy today.dave may come close in Monkey Wrench, but it fits!); and production that shines and stands out.

B00006RCOB|4.0|Remember the Soviet Union?<br /><br />You know, the Hammer & the Sickle? May Day parades with lots of pointy black missile-thingies rolling down Red Square? 265-year-old Russian generals with those killer super-size hats? The Kremlin, the Gulag, Exile in Siberia?<br /><br />Ya know, the USSR, aka The Evil Empire. Remember those guys?<br /><br />Way back in the seventies and eighties---way back in the *Day*, you know---the Soviet Union was THE BIG THREAT. The Soviets made great villains: when their premiers weren't snarling or shooting henchmen or trying to have Bond killed, they were pounding their shoes on UN lecterns and threatening to 'bury us'. Everywhere we were, they were in our face: Iran, Iraq, the Middle East, Vietnam, the Korean Peninsula. Hell, everywhere we *weren't*, they were in our face: Hungary, Czechoslovakia, even Afghanistan.<br /><br />On the days when they weren't going to nuke us rubble, rumor was that their vast armies were ever poised to roll into West Germany with its armored divisions, supported by swarms of attack helicopters, armored personnel carriers, and of course the feared, deadly Red Army itself, storming into a helpless Western Europe under the banner of international Marxism!<br /><br />They seemed implacable, evil, unstoppable.<br /><br />Until one day.<br /><br />One day when \\"Firefox\\" hit the box office. \\"Firefox\\", with directing and acting provided by Clint Eastwood.<br /><br />\\"Firefox\\", a straightforward little flick about a super-secret agent (Clint) called out of retirement to steal the Soviet Union's big, sleek, fast, shiny new toy, the MIG-31 superiority fighter. A flick where, fortunately, there was a lotta scenery to chew, and a lot got chewed, between Eastwood and Klaus Lowitsch (uber-baddie Soviet General Vladimirov who just *knows* something ain't right).<br /><br />\\"Firefox\\", a film so unabashedly hammy and so unreservedly tense that even in the final minutes, when it became apparent we were watching two toy MIGS imposed on stock footage having at it---well, we didn't care.<br /><br />But see, \\"Firefox\\" has a greater claim to fame than just being a high-octane slab of Cold War cheese, with an extra helping of cheese. In 1989, after all, the Soviet Union---our great, scary, tireless foe---collapsed.<br /><br />Now: some folks still say the Soviet Union was collapsing under its own weight and incompetence, that the writing was on the wall, that its feeble economy couldn't keep up with its frantic military spending. Some say Ronald \\"The Gipper\\" Reagan scared the bewhooskers out of those crazy old Cossacks with their giganto-hats, and made 'em spend that much faster, accelerating their demise. Some say it was Gorbachev, and glasnost, and perestroika.<br /><br />Those folks are entitled to their opinions---but you look at \\"Firefox\\"'s release date---1982---and realize that only 7 short years later, deprived of its sleek and wicked MIG-31, the Soviet Union was a shambles, a total ruin.<br /><br />I think it was Clint Eastwood who did it.<br /><br />JSGe watching two toy MIGS imposed on stock footage having at it---well, we didn't care. <br /> <br />But see, \\"Firefox\\" has a greater claim to fame than just being a high-octane slab of Cold War cheese, with an extra helping of cheese.

Like Constantine's ability to go into hell and then return twice baked.  This movie is watchable once.  There isn't anything in this movie that would compel me to watch it again.  I, once again, learned why I wait till Hollwood Video puts them up for sale at discount.  This one will be in the $5.99 to $7.99 range soon enough.  Wait for the discount.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|There is no Spoon.<br /><br />You remember that one, right? With the room of gifted child prodigies under the nanny-ship of The Oracle, particularly the little genius with the spoon-shaped head who was busy bending a spoon. How didja do that, son? Easy---<br /><br />There is no Spoon.<br /><br />Now, Larry Wachowski, months before Reloaded's massively anticipated release, got Matrix fanboys foaming in their droolcups when, asked about the reputedly eye-boggling new special effects in the new flick (shot back-to-back with Revolutions) and queried whether the Brothers Wachowski were about to Raise the Bar, replied: \\"there is no Bar\\".<br /><br />Turns out he was just joking. \\"There is no Bar\\", get it?<br /><br />The Audience didn't: Reloaded suffer the fate of everything that toys with the brutal, double-edged Sword of Hype. Given the cultic frenzy that surrounded the opening, given the peek the first Matrix provided into a world in which mankind had been played the fool by his Machines and shackled into an invisible bondage---given all of that, could anything deliver on such a Promise?<br /><br />The answer, in true Matrix fashion: Revolutions is a Binary flick. You know, those little zeroes and ones that, taken together, represent The Holy Bible, or a storefront, or a superpowered cadillac sedan driven by two dredlocked razor-wielding monsters. The Desert of the Real; the World of Illusion.<br /><br />With that in mind...<br /><br />ONE: The Matrix Rating (the World of Illusion): 5 Stars. Reloaded is a technophile's fever-dream, and in this glossy, mechanistic, techno-sensual Real the Wachowskis entertain in spades.<br /><br />Reloaded oozes style, just like its predecessor, and the supple combination of high-technology glossiness and urban grime that defined the unique visuals of the first movie have been delivered seamlessly into the sequel.<br /><br />That's no surprise, since the Wachowskis wisely brought the entire team from the first movie along for the second ride. On hand for the sequel is Director of Photography Bill Pope and Costume Designer Kym Barrett, and both deliver the goods. Reloaded looks jaw-droppingly, drool-spatteringly delicious.<br /><br />The original cast (minus, sadly, Tank & Apoc) are all back as well: Morpheus (an increasingly portly Laurence Fishburne), Trinity (Carrie-Ann Moss) and Neo (an increasingly Zen Keanu Reeves) all turn in competent, if not outstanding, performances, and Hugo Weaving's nefarious Agent Smith tries not to steal the show (and mostly fails: Reloaded is at its best when Weaving is snarling and mincing onscreen).<br /><br />The Wachowskis toss in some other intriguing characters to round out the ensemble, including the dastardly Merovingian (played suavely, but talkatively, by Lambert Wilson), his gorgeous mistress Persephone (played tastily by Monica Bellucci), his razor-wielding Twin henchmen (done not with CGI, but played by real-life twins Adrian and Neil Rayment and a real-life razorblade!), and Jada Pinkett Smith's understated Captain Niobe.<br /><br />So it entertains. But...<br /><br />ZERO: The Desert of the Real Rating: 3 Stars. Is this the flick you wanted to see, thought you would see, when the credits rolled at the end of \\"The Matrix\\"?<br /><br />Me neither. Yes, \\"Reloaded\\" is anchored fore and aft and amidships with some eye-popping action setpieces, chiefly the Freeway chase and the mountain-top Chalet duel with the Merovingian's lackeys. Yes, it oozes style from its steel and CGI pores. If \\"Matrix: Reloaded\\" were a ship, it would have mighty pretty rigging and sails.<br /><br />Yes, it was cool to see the big exo-skeleton walkers lumbering around in Zion. No, I didn't find the Zion Rave scene embarrassing (celebrate, party like it's 1999 chal, 'cause we're FREE! I can dig it).<br /><br />But after the \\"Burn the Barricades!\\" coda of the first flick, I wanted something more. Neo can bend the \\"rules\\" of the Matrix now: he can tweak all those leetle zeroes and ones in his favor. So why stick around to fight Agent Smith in the tedious 'Burly Brawl'? Why not conjure up a few werewolves of his own to keep him busy?<br /><br />Or, while we're at it---if 'waking up' those slave-minds is so critical to the Revolution, why not *really* shake things up a bit? You know, mebbe introduce a few square miles of the Kalihari Desert in the middle of the City?<br /><br />Seen in the LED readout-afterburn of \\"Matrix: Revolutions\\", \\"Reloaded\\" makes considerably more sense: certainly it's operatic in its sleek, luxurious gloss and glamor.<br /><br />But the real problem is this: the first \\"Matrix\\" was our very unauthorized glimpse into the Truth behind \\"Reality\\". It felt like finding out a very dangerous, dirty secret. It felt conspiratorial, which was half the fun.<br /><br />It's pretty, true, and if you pick up the Ultimate collection and pop this baby in the hopper of your high-end system, you'll watch in amazement as the rafters shake, plaster cracks and falls, car alarms go off.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, \\"Reloaded\\" is just another big action flick.

B0007Y4USW|5.0|This is the trpe of album you play over and over again because it does move fast. Each songs seems direct and to the point, however Mariah pulls it off. I mean we all know she can stretch a note into like 10 but on Mimi she has toned down in many ways(Please note that a toned down Mariah is still way over-the-top)...Lets start with the songs..It's Like That is a true party record \\"them chickens is ash and I'm lotion\\"...We Belong Together is an entity all to itself and this song alone is worth the price of the cd. It's pretty impressive to think that in 2 weeks We Belong Together could become the biggest hit of the 2000's according to Billboard. Mariah also had the biggest song in the 90's with \\"One Sweet Day\\". Nonetheless Mariah's a proven hitmaker and Shake It Off is no different. Plain and simple, the streets love Mariah's summertime music.

B0002X314C|5.0|This is truly a great album.  Every single song is good and has some meaning to it.  JL has a really good voice and with Kanye and Snoop on the record how can you go wrong?  All those guys that say this album sucks apparently can't appreciate someone with a good voice.  I mean what did you expect a hardcore rap album?  Bottom line is simply that if you like R&B or Ginuwine, R.Kelly, Usher, then you'll like John Legend.
B0007Y08IS|4.0|If you're a South Park fan, then you'll likely get a kick out of this movie. Parker and Stone have done another good job of combining harsh satire with awkwardly moving characters to create a no-holds-barred politically incorrect comedy. I think it's fair to say that everyone in this movie is insulted at some point, although the self-righteous Hollywood crowd gets special treatment from the directors, along with the tyrannical dictator of North Korea, Kim Jong-Il.<br /><br />What was particularly impressive about this film was the \\"acting\\" and facial expressions on the puppets. The design of these figures was very well-done and are an integral part of the movie. Also very funny and creative are the songs written by Parker and Stone, which are as important to this movie as the music is for South Park Uncut.<br /><br />The extra features included with this DVD are also quite interesting. Particularly noteworthy is an interview with the designers of the Kim Jong-Il puppet who talk about how they created the face and even the process they went through to pick his eyeglasses.<br /><br />If you you're ready for some raunchy politically incorrect humor, this is a good choice for you.

B000AM4PBS|5.0|Friends is one of the most defining TV shows of the nineties, second only to Seinfeld. Freinds has had a nice good run (1994-2004) and has developed a very loyal fan base. This show follows a group of six friends while they thry to go through this crazy life. Through heartbreak, divorce, and even death, this how takles serious issues while still keeping the comedy going. If I could only buy 1 TV-on-DVD, it would be the \\"Friends\\" series. It is great seeing these people evolve and go through relationships with one another. Joey is one of the most funny, partly becuase he is portrayed as the most stupid person alive, and Chandler is his roomate (for the first couple seasons) and his best friend. Chanler is known for his quick witt and making everything more dramatic than it is. Joey and Chandler are the perfect model for a male-bonding relationship. The stick with each other through thick and thin, even when Joey wears Chandler's clothes while going \\"commando\\" (Could I be wearing any more clothes?!) Later in the series Chandler strikes up a relationship with Monica Gellar, the ex-fatty, neurotic, neat-freak. Monica is known for being extremelly well-organized, and reminising about her days as a fatty. Monica's brother is Ross Gellar, an intelligent Paleantologist who has to put up with all of his freinds insults, and jokes. since the first season he and Rachel Greene have been having an on-agin-off-again relationship. Rachel starts in the series as the typical daddy's girl who just stood up for herself to make a name for herself. She moves in with old high school friend Monica Gellar, and all the Friends begin their bonding. Monica's ex-roomate is Phoebe Buffay, an eccentric loner whose life has been very unfortunate (until now) her mother gave both of her kids away for adoption (Phoebe and her twin) and later in life her adoptive mother killed herself forcing Phoebe to live on the streets. Now she lives by herslef, and works as a masseous.She is not the brightest person, but sometimes she can turn out to be the funniest one of the series. This show is my FAVORITE show of ALL TIME!!! I love this show! And you should buy this series, and watch the hilarious and sometimes wacky exploits of these 6 FRIENDS!
B00005JNTX|3.0|I agree...Rourke was fantastic...Del Toro and Willis were fine also. <br /> <br />Besides that...The plot didn't seem that intersting.  Alba, gorgeous as always, but overall the movie never really delivers what it could.   <br /> <br />I really was expecting more.  I saw some reviews on the terrible sound, also somo talking about the stories never concting...and I agree with them. <br /> <br />Not as good as some people say, but tolerable.

0783116934|4.0|It is a shame how so few are familiar with this great feature film - an HBO production of grand artistic scale.<br /><br />Though somewhat claustrophobic in its style, and rightfully so, the true story of one of the planet's most prolific serial murderers is expertly captured by use of clever direction, well-paced dialog and events, and potent performances by a series of respected actors in varying roles.  The true menace of Chikatilo is aided by the reluctance of the Communist Soviet Rule to accept his very existence.  These events take place amidst the decline of Soviet Communism and exhibit the way in which its fall brought about a more rapid conclusion to the mystery.<br /><br />It is not difficult to allow such motion picture dignitaries as Stephen Rea, Donald Sutherland, Joss Ackland, Jeffrey DeMunn, and Max Von Sydow to bring these characters to life.<br /><br />Highlights include a terribly frightening murder of the laughing woman, and a terribly frightened Dr. Alexandr Bukhanovsky performed by Max Von Sydow.

Zimmer, to my mind, is today's equivalent of Beethoven, Wagner, Bruckner and Sibelius, all rolled into one. A worthy heir of a musical tradition that's languished under the yoke of modernist distortion for far too long, relegated to musty 'concerts' or being adapted for pop-culture and consumption by those who can't relate to music without watching the music video, or those who need it all packaged up into 'The Best of XYZ'.<br /><br />The score captures the mood and pace of the movie, with its ebb and flow, its highs and lows-and ultimately it goes one better and transcends it.<br /><br />It doesn't come much better than that.<br /><br />Till Noever, Author: Keaen, (...)
B00003CXCT|4.0|Quite simply speaking, these are spectacular American feature films.  I understand however, the valid argument from both sides regarding the 1997 digital [CGI] re-issues.  In most cases, such intrusions on the original work of any film would be unwelcome.  Imagine adding or subtracting an element from The Wizard of Oz, Citizen Kane or dare I say [\\"dare... dare\\"] Blazing Saddles?  In most cases it would appear invasive if anything.  Films are, as they were at time of creation, imperfect - and should be respected as such.  At the same time, an 'improvement' (or degradation in some minds) can be rewarding.  Whatever your opinion, the persons responsible for the release of this set should have made special considerations for the legions of Star Wars fans by including both 'versions' of these pictures.
0684833395|4.0|I do not know how I avoided Catch-22 during high school and college, but I'm glad I waited no longer. Catch-22 is the classic war satire and while some aspects of it are a little dated, it still rings very true in the contemporary political climate. Heller's characters are all quirky, intense and unique, but their conversations and actions really penetrate the absurdity of war and are very entertaining. I personally think the larger goals of World War II were noble and worthy, but when the impact of the war on those people who were actually fighting it are examined through Heller's off-kilter viewpoint, it becomes clear that there are tremendous costs and failings when trying to achieve those goals. This is a wonderfully amusing book and for people who are interested in more than a laugh, it also has an important message. I would highly recommend this book for anyone who has not read it before.
0755111974|5.0|This book is absolutely, brilliantly funny. The wit and unique characterizations are woven with great descriptions of the animals and plants of Corfu. That Durrell can hold the attention of readers who have no interest in biology simply demonstrates what a fine work this is. Gerald's depiction of a larger-than-life expatriate family on a larger-than-life Greek island is a tremendous celebration of life. The variety of different Greek characters parading through this book rivals the variety of Corfu's flora and fauna. Absolute great read!
B00005Y84D|5.0|Concert For Bangladesh coming on DVD October 25th!    From The Beatles' official web site:    Apple Corps is proud to announce the autumn 2005 release of \\"The Concert For Bangladesh  George Harrison & friends\\" on DVD and CD.    The Concert for Bangladesh was the first benefit concert of its kind in that it brought together an extraordinary assemblage of major artists collaborating for a common humanitarian cause  setting the precedent that music could be used to serve a higher cause. The concert sold out Madison Square Garden and along with the Grammy  Award-winning triple-album boxset, and the feature film, has generated millions of dollars for UNICEF and raised awareness for the organisation around the world, as well as among other musicians and their fans. It is therefore acknowledged as the inspiration and forerunner to the major global fundraising events of recent years. To quote the United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan, \\"George and his friends were pioneers.\\"    Besides George himself the concert features some of his friends, including: Ravi Shankar, Bob Dylan, Eric Clapton, Ringo Starr, Leon Russell and Billy Preston. Performances include `Here Comes The Sun', `Something', `While My Guitar Gently Weeps', `My Sweet Lord', `Just Like A Woman', `Blowin' In The Wind' and `A Hard Rain's A-Gonna Fall'.    During the struggle for independence from Pakistan millions of refugees fled to neighbouring India to escape hunger, disease and bloodshed. The crisis was deepened when massive floods hit the region. Alerted to the scale of the suffering by his friend Ravi Shankar, George Harrison organised The Concert For Bangladesh at Madison Square Garden on August 1st, 1971 with the proceeds going to UNICEF.    The DVD will be released by WMG (Warner Music Group) on October 25th, 2005 in the USA, and October 24th in the rest of the world, as a 2-disc package, including the original 99-minute film restored and remixed in 5.1, as well as 72-minutes of extras. The extras feature a 45-minute documentary \\"The Concert For Bangladesh Revisited with George Harrison & friends\\", about the background to the two shows with exclusive interviews and contributions from UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan and Sir Bob Geldof. There is also previously unseen footage: \\"If Not For You\\", featuring George and Bob Dylan from rehearsals, \\"Come On In My Kitchen\\" featuring George, Eric Clapton and Leon Russell at the sound check and a Bob Dylan performance from the afternoon show of \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\", not included in the original film.    Apple Corps/WMG, will also simultaneously release a special deluxe version (limited to 50,000 copies worldwide) that will feature a 64-page book and other collectibles.    The album of the concert has been remixed and repackaged as a 2-disc set, and is also released on October 25th, 2005 in the USA by Capitol Records and on October 24th in the rest of the world, by Sony BMG Entertainment. This will contain an additional track, the Bob Dylan performance of \\"Love Minus Zero/No Limit\\".
B00005JLWN|4.0|Though I had some reservations about the film given the many comparisons I was hearing to The Matrix, they are only similar in their action sequences.  <br /> <br />Action! <br />While The Matrix has its \\"bending of physics,\\" Equilibrium has \\"Gun Kata,\\" whereby a person learns through rigourous training how to kill rooms filled with people using guns in precise short motions for maximum effect. It sounds odd, but when you see it in action you'll appreciate the effect. Later on in the movie they even use kattanas to do battle. Suffice to say, the action sequences are pretty cool. <br /> <br />Plot! <br />The plot for Equilibrium is nearly an exact replica of George Orwell's book (and the movie) 1984 (written in 1940 as a desperate warning about where the current state of politics was going to take the human race). They chose to take from the right book though, as George Orwell's book becomes more relevant every year.  <br /> <br />The basic premise of the movie is that human emotion has been abolished and everyone must take a drug that inhibits any feelings. The main character (Christian Bale) works for an agency that tracks down people who have abandoned the drug and are \\"feeling.\\" Usually to arrest them, but often to kill them as people who have tasted emotion are rarely willing to give it up again. A \\"Big Brother\\" figure gives speeches to the world about how emotion has destroyed the world in the past with wars and racism and violence. At one point, the main character's partner (in stopping emotion feelers) reveals that he has abandoned the emotion stopping drug. The main character must then make a choice, and from that point on the world ceases to be a simple place for Christian Bale. Anything more would ruin the story for you so I'll stop here. However, if you decide not to see Equilibrium, I highly recommend reading 1984 due to its ever increasing relevance in the modern day. <br /> <br />Acting! <br />Christian Bale does an excellent job portraying the main character (John Preston) torn between a world of emotion and the strict and regimented world that is familiar and almost comforting to him. The other actors in this film (and there are many that will make you go, wait, isn't that the guy/gal from Bravehart/Golden Eye/Punch Drunk Love/etcetcetc) do an excellent job as well, though there are several moments where they go a bit over the top trying to get across what their character is supposed to be feeling. <br /> <br />Directing, Editing, Scenery! <br />The directing and editing both seem well done. No complaints. The scenery is quite drab being all grey and blue, but it is a necessary component of the \\"world is not allowed to feel emotion\\" stuff that plays out in the movie. It also helps to accentuate the few bits of color that you do end up seeing. <br /> <br />Overall! <br />While not quite a full 4 star movie, Equilibrium has its moments and is a good take on the book 1984. If you are into high action movies, or if you appreciate dark future world plots, then you will probably enjoy Equilibrium.
0930289528|4.0|this is an interesting book on many levels. the hero is obviously out of his mind. the villians believe they are doing the right things. and then there are the in-betweens. the police officer's wife who's life is shattered when he dies. the controlling wife of another officer. multi-layed goodness.<br /><br />the only real drawback to the book is that it's beginning to show it's age. and the fact that while technically, English is spoken by  on both sides of the pond, reality is that American English and the Queen's English are just different enough to make understanding a bit difficult. petty things, that's all.<br /><br />i did enjoy the book, and have high hopes for the movie that will be out soon.
B0000942HV|1.0|Tubular Bells... A seminal record, arguably the one that spawned the New Age genre. The soundtrack of many mind-expanding late-night listening sessions, with candle light and the warm, full sound of legendary turntables by companies such as Thorens and Linn. Loved by millions of listeners worldwide and with millions of sales behind...    Then, perfectionist Mike Oldfield comes back in 2003 to re-record it, as he was not satisfied by his playing on the original recording. The new recording is technically pristine and has given new breath to sections of the original composition that we didn't pay that much attention to. For instance, check out \\"Russian\\" and \\"Harmonics\\".    Is there anything I don't like about this record? Yes.    First of all, I simply detest Mike Oldfield's distorted guitar tone. He uses far too much preamplifier gain (and, what's worse, he goes for - gasp - DIGITAL distortion), with too little power stage gain, meaning that the tone is not full-bodied, as it should, but, instead, it's fizzy and mushy, with absolutely no note definition in the distorted chords. And no, I do NOT listen to the music I've painstakingly bought through \\"old tin boxes\\".    Second, I do not approve of his choice for a Wal bass over the original recording's Fender (if I remember well, it was a Jazz Bass). The Wal sounds too dark, brooding and uncontrollable.    Third, I prefer natural violins over synthesized ones. The same goes for all the real instruments that were replaced by synths and computers. No matter how perfect and \\"life-like\\" the emulations are, there's just something missing from them. Getting back to the violins, would you ever imagine City's \\"Am Fenster\\" played on a computer? I think not.    Fourth, the \\"copy protection\\" system, which is what ultimately made me give this record only ONE star (and also made millions of music lovers turn their backs on mr. Oldfield, outraged by the multitude of CD and DVD players that were damaged by this disc). The \\"CD\\" versionis simply NOT a Compact Disc, it is incompatible and non-compliant to Philips' Red Book standard and might not play properly on your machine; in fact, it might even damage it. And Mike Oldfield's attitude was annoying, as he dismissed the complaints of the legitimate buyers, teaming with WEA. Sorry mr. Oldfield, I am NOT on your side here. If you really want the re-recorded and reworked Tubular Bells, order the DVD-Audio or SACD version (provided your player is up to it), which really let the recording shine.    So...    Music: 4 stars    Usability: 0    Artist's attitude towards his fans: 0    There you have it.    (...)

0553274503|5.0|When I first read Flowers for Algernon over thirty years ago, I was fascinated by the way Charlie, after thirty years of being considered stupid, quickly became smarter and smarter, mastering increasingly difficult subjects and solving complex problems of science, math, and even linguistics. I was less interested in his emotional problems and his social difficulties. I remember the horror of realizing that he was going to lose his mental abilities and that he would be aware of what was happening to him, yet helpless to prevent it.<br /><br />I found myself recalling the story when I recently helped a relative move into a nursing home. She has an Alzheimer's-like condition that makes it unsafe for her to live on her own or even to go out by herself. She used to be mentally sharp, loved to travel, and took a brisk walk every day. She understands what is happening to her brain and knows there is nothing that she can do about it. She has gone from forgetting little-used words like \\"ginger-ale\\" to forgetting everyday words like \\"calendar\\" and \\"TV\\" and even the name of the street she lived on for the last forty years. She is remarkably philosophical about what is happening to her, explaining to her friends that that's just the way it is.<br /><br />But it must be terribly frustrating to have your own brain let you down after all these years, and to know that it will keep getting worse, and that no one can do anything to stop it. When I found a copy of Flowers for Algernon, I was hesitant to read it again, afraid it would be too close to home this time. It's a fast-moving story that gets going right away. Soon I was caught up in the changes Charlie is going through and dreading the inevitable ending.<br /><br />To my surprise, the ending did not leave me feeling helpless and depressed. Although it was a shame that Charlie couldn't remain a genius, he seemed more at peace with his life in the end, and even more mature as a human being. In the story, as in real life, if you have a choice (and most of us do), you should choose to be smarter. If, on the other hand, you really no longer have a choice, there's something to be said for accepting that. (For what it's worth, if it ever comes to it, I will fight it tooth and nail.), if you have a choice (and most of us do), you should choose to be smarter.

B00005JNSK|5.0|Immediately after watching Charlie & The Chocolate Factory, I quickly read the book, found to my amazement a 90% movie/book correlation, and then rewatched the first movie starring Gene Wilder.  The winner is Tim Burton's version, and is it a sweet treat!<br /><br />Those who have either read Roald Dahl's book or seen the Gene Wilder version will know of the mad search for five golden tickets hidden in chocolateer Willy Wonka's Wonka Bars, the prize being a guided tour given to a child and one parent, and other prizes.  Charlie Bucket lives with his poverty-ridden family in a cramped decrepit house in the city with both his parents and both sets of grandparents, his elders sharing the same bed, one couple facing each other.  Besides listening to Grandpa Joe's stories, his sole bright time of the year is getting a Wonka bar for his birthday.<br /><br />He is lucky enough to be one of the five winners and takes his Grandpa Joe with him<br />Variations include added material, such as Willy Wonka's life as a child, which sends him into a bit of a daze whenever he remembers it, most of it due to Charlie's questions.  In flashbacks, one witnesses Willy in an oppressive braces contraption, installed by his severe anti-sweets dentist father (Christopher Lee) that resembles a torture device rather than something to straighten teeth.<br /><br />Johnny Depp is perfect as Willy Wonka, down to the costume, dreamy smile, childish imagination-in other words, a lovable eccentric.  Despite the sort of high-pitched voice, pale face, and gloved hands, the comparisons to Michael Jackson are unjustified.  He has some funny lines, when introducing the candy meadow.  \\"Everything in there is edible, including me.  But that's called cannibalism and is frowned upon.\\"<br /><br />Per the book, both of Charlie's parents are alive.  And instead of the Anthony Newley/Leslie Bricusse songs, two of the songs from the book are used;  the ones the Oompa Loompas use after Augustus is sent up the strawberry fudge factory is close to if not identical to the song in the book.  And yes, Veruca's disposal is by a hoard of trained squirrels in charge of cracking walnuts and not for desiring a golden egg.  This leads to the funniest line and double-entendre in the film, shouted by Wonka to Veruca:  \\"Don't touch that squirrel's nuts!\\"  And David Kelly is perfect as Grandpa Joe, as he does appear 96 years old compared to Jack Albertson.  Kelly of course played Michael O'Sullivan in Waking Ned Devine, where he is seen riding a motorcycle in the countryside in his birthday suit.<br /><br />I suppose one can forgive 70's technology, but the river and waterfalls of chocolate in the edible meadow is thicker and more chocolaty compared to the original, which more or less looked like mop water.  And Violet's transformation is more realistic than the original, where it looked like she had blue lights shining on her.<br /><br />As for the four naughty tykes, well, they compare favourably to the earlier incarnations of Augustus, Veruca, Violet, and Mike.  Mike Teavee's favourite pastime is updated to PS2-type violent video games, and his kicking of sweets in the meadow is rather disturbing.  Veruca herself is even more vicious and demanding of her parents.  Indeed, when her father hands her the golden tickets his factory workers have found, she looks as if she expected nothing less and instantly says, \\"I want a new pony.\\"  Uh, is \\"thank you very much\\" in her vocabulary?  Apparently not!<br /><br />This also reunites Johnny Depp and Freddie Highmore once more, as Depp played J.M. Barrie to Freddie's Peter in Finding Neverland.  And it's high time Deep Roy, who plays the hundreds of digitally duplicated Oompa Loompas, got some recognition, as I remember him as the ill-fated midget assassin in The Pink Panther Strikes Again, the homicidal Mr. Sin in Dr. Who-Talons of Weng-Chiang.  This is his third film with Burton after Planet of the Apes and Big Fish (Mr. Soggybottom).  He has lotsof fun doing the songs, especially one where there's a nod to Busby Berkeley's bathing beauties diving into the pool and doing the synchronized routine where they form a star, and the 80's heavy metal spoof following Mike's disposal.<br /><br />It pays to be modest and quiet, as opposed to being gluttonous, greedy, ultra-competitive, violent, or addicted to TV to the exclusion of all else.  That's Charlie Bucket for you.  And it also pays to be creative and talented-that's Tim Burton and Johnny Depp for you.d to Busby Berkeley's bathing beauties diving into the pool and doing the synchronized routine where they form a star, and the 80's heavy metal spoof following Mike's disposal.

Dick).<br /><br />The plot of this movie is simple.  Rick Deckard (Harrison Ford) is a policeman or \\"blade runner\\" of Los Angeles (in the year 2019) who's after four criminal \\"replicants\\" named Roy Batty (Rutger Haur), Pris (Daryl Hannah), Zhora (Joanna Cassidy), and Leon (Brion James).  Deckard accidentally develops a romance with the more sophisticated replicant Rachael (Sean Young).<br /><br />Unlike \\"The Director's Cut\\" version of this movie, this original version has Deckard's voice-over narration.  I found this voice-over especially emotionally appealing when the Roy Batty replicant \\"dies\\" at the end of the movie.<br /><br />I think I deduced the reasons why the voice-over is so important for this movie:<br /><br />(1) It allows the viewer to follow the action.  (A friend of mine who watched \\"The Director's Cut\\" with me and who did not see the original release with Deckard's voice-over could not follow the story!!)<br />(2) It provides the human touch to counterbalance all the technological and visually stunning special effects.<br />(3) It adds a \\"retro\\" feel that reminded me of old-time detective movies.<br /><br />The ending, unlike \\"The Director's Cut,\\" was not abrupt.  This ending gave a feeling of hope that Deckard and the replicant Rachael would have a future together.<br /><br />All the acting in this movie is first-rate.  Special mention should go to Harrison Ford who as the blade runner Rick Deckard carries the movie and to Rutger Haur as the leader of the replicants, Roy Batty.  Also, Sean Young does a super job portraying the more sophisticated replicant, Rachael.<br /><br />The special effects that highlight the steel-and-microchip jungle of twenty-first century L.A. and the background music by Vangelis are fantastic and exhilarating.<br /><br />The only problem is that this original version of this movie is not available on DVD (as of the date of this review).  This is truly unfortunate.  (\\"The Director's Cut\\" is available on DVD.)<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE:<br /><br />With its voice-over narration, this is a magnificent and classic science fiction movie with emotional impact.

B000003TA4|1.0|I hate to offend all you Nirvana loving Generation Xers, but the truth must be told: Nirvana is the most overhyped, overrated, annoying band in history!  Only in the 90s could an unstable dopehead calling himself 'Kurdt' be hailed as a 'genius' and a 'brilliant songwriter'.  Kurt Cobain a brilliant songwriter?  Is that when he's on heroin or coke?  In the drug crazed world of the Seattle grunge scene, everybody was too stoned to see Kurt Cobain for what he really was----a filthy, unbathed, dirty looking lowlife----out of his mind on drugs----who wrote inane lyrics while playing the same three chords on his noisy, muddy, out of tune, distorted guitar.  \\"Wow dudes!  These lyrics sound like, totally deep!  I can't understand anything he sings, so that must mean he's saying something profound...\\"  Most blatently hypocritical of all is the fact that this whiney, noisemaking nitwit became a filthy rich, multi millionaire, even as he moaned and groaned about the evils of commercialism.  Hey Nirvana fans, tell me this.  If Kurt Cobain really was so underground and hardcore, than why did he make so many videos for MTV?  Why did he perform live on MTV and Saturday Night Live?  Why did he sign multi million dollar, major label record deals?  I'll tell you why.  It is because Nirvana nothing more than a group of hypocrites, out to make money off an obnoxious pop culture fad.  Kurt Cobain was a phoney who didn't stick to his principles!  He lived a double standard.  He would say one thing and do something completely different at every turn.  He called other artists 'sellouts' even though he was making millions and millions of dollars selling this garbage he called 'music'.  Nirvana were nothing but a corporate rock hit machine tailor made by a record company to exploit a fad.  Face it people, Nirvana were the Backstreet Boys of 1992!  The fact that such a blatent corporate marketing scam like Nirvana is still popular over a decade after Kurt Cobain ate that shotgun barrel is a testament to the power of marketing.  If you buy into all the hype about Nirvana 'saving rock n roll' or 'killing off hair metal', than you my friend, are a sucker!  As PT Barnum once put it, \\"There's a sucker born every minute!\\"  And all the people who think Nirvana saved rock are exacxtly that----SUCKERS!!!  Nirvana had no talent what so ever.  Their success was based solely on image, and nothing more.  The only reason their fans liked them is because of how they looked----flannel shirts, ripped jeans, and greasy, unwashed hair.  People thought this unbathed appearence made them the \\"anti hair band\\", when in fact they were manufactured by their record company, like a 90s version of Linkin Park!  The music they performed was nothing but complete and pointless noise pollution, and there's no way it ever would have sold without all that hype.  Nirvana is the worst band the world has ever known.  Nirvana was pure trash!

With just one album Xtina explored Negro hookers from the projects, goths, anorexics, fatties, gay couples, drag queens, the Latinos, the Egyptians and the Chinese.  Xtina pays \\"tribute\\" to P!NK, the Sugababes, Madonna, Alicia Keys, Macy Gray, Mariah Carey and countless more on this 20-track car crash of an album.  From the faux-dramatic intro to the coma-inducing unfunniness of the hidden outro, there's nary an original note on the album. <br /> <br />The album starts off on a hilarious melodramatic note with \\"Stripped Part 1\\", one of the MANY laugh-out-loud moments to be found on the album.  An epic, dramatic blur of newsbytes and reports on her DANGEROUSLY CONTROVERSIAL celebrity life (an imaginary beef with Eminem, no doubt hatched for Xtina to latch onto some of his fame; the non-event Fred Durst liaison; and the Britney feud) then clears its way for the newly improved XTINA and her dramatic piano.  \\"Sorry you can't define me/Sorry I break the mould,\\" she proclaims in a spew of embarrassing self-righteous couplets.  Looks like we're set for an album of DRAMA, GRIT and RAW emotion of ball-breaking proportions. <br /> <br />Next comes a hat trick of the most heartless genre ripoffs in recent memory: \\"Can't Hold Us Down\\", which features a tired feminist message and Lil' Kim complaining about her lack of cullingus; \\"Walk Away\\", a dreadful torch ballad which will no doubt pave the way for her so-called jazzy/soulful/blues 3rd album; and \\"Fighter\\" an embarrassing lesbian grunge which AvrilLavigne, Mel C or even Jacynthe could pull off with more grit.  <br /> <br />Take one listen on \\"Infatuation\\", a tinny-sounding hybrid of \\"La Isla Bonita\\" and \\"Papa Don't Preach\\", and it's obvious that no oversinging or flamenco guitars can hide the fact that the album survives on copying everyone from Madonna to Macy Gray.  The hilarious Latina lyrics and music are undeservingly overmined by Xtina's overselling of the song, screaming every other world as an ad-lib or Spanish translation.  GERALDINE ESTELLE HALLIWELL, J. Lo or even the long-forgotten 11:30 could've tackled this song with more class and Spanish \\"flava\\".  <br /> <br />The middle stretch of the album sees Xtina trying to become a serious and soulful artist, but the problem is she overruns her voice so much that she destroys any sort of melodic timing the songs have, leaving the songs tuneless.  For an album claiming to be \\"extremely personal\\" and \\"edgy\\", it's filled with countless ballads and songs that anybody played on Chum FM can sing better.  \\"Loving Me 4 Me\\" sounds like background music from a second rate porn movie or the type of music grownups play during dinner parties, while \\"Impossible\\" and \\"Underappreciated\\" sees Xtina desperately trying to capture the soul and funk of FIERCELY HETEROSEXUAL Alicia Keys and Macy Gray, respectively.  (The latter is one of the unfunkiest songs in aural history). <br /> <br />Linda Perry's tragic beauty is best displayed on \\"Beautiful\\" an undeniably great song somewhat sang rather emotionless by Christina, who intends on showing of the Middle C and E note throughout the album as opposed to delivering any feeling into the lyrics, which is an opportunity wasted when one considers her lack of natural beauty.  Next up is the throroughly awful \\"Make Over\\" which rips off the Sugababes' brilliant \\"Overload\\" down to its lyrics.  It's so tuneless and out-of-key that even Bi Ying hates it.  However in the context of the album it does its job as putting an end to the previous eight songs' drab balladry.  Next up is \\"Cruz\\", which is so exhausting to listen to it's difficult to put what my ears are going through to words.  It's like \\"I'm Not A Girl, Not Yet A Woman\\" sung in a desert by LeAnn Rimes and Cher's lovechild in hell.  And in an uninspired musical ripoff of Madonna's fabulous Blond Ambition tour, the uninspiring and non-uplifting gospel track \\"Soar\\" goes straight into... <br /> <br />...the sweaty casual sex track \\"Get Mine, Get Yours\\".  Again, the whole woman sexual empowerment thing is a bit 20 years ago, and her lyrics are as nasty as ever, but the song's sexy grinding production and string arrangement is impressive, her vocals rising from a sweet whisper to something powerful near the end.  (Climax?) Next up is \\"Dirrty\\", her finest moment on record and on celluloid.  Capping all this excitement off is \\"Stripped Part 2\\", famous for the lines \\"Sorry I'm not a virgin/Sorry I'm not a slut (ohhh!!)\\".  It provides the album with some much needed, unintentional comic relief. <br /> <br />Numerous power ballads dominate the last few tracks, all blending into one big American Idol episode or Disc 1 of Whitney's Greatest Hits, only without the SOUL.  And with the drum-and-bass outro of \\"Keep On Singin' My Song\\", 78 minutes of unlistenable, tedious aural turd is over.  The album is so long and overproduced that it's difficult to remember any of the good songs, other than one big midtempo pile of crap.  The problem with this album is that it's one of those albums that 40 year old divas make, such as \\"Just Whitney\\" without the hot P. Diddy Remix.  It's old and regurgitated, its themes dated and borrowed, it's music lazy and it's lyrics arrogant indulgence.  It's amazing how Xtina believes her own hype after her not-even-that-good first album and \\"Lady Marmalade\\".  This is one of those albums where the artist is given too much artistic freedom and runs with it like a horny old man on Church Street, and ending up in a car crash.

B00005JLEU|5.0|I bought this DVD after seeing a review for its animator on the CBS show Sunday Morning. The piece said that the Japanese artist is considered by many to be the best living animator in the world. Intrigued, I got a copy of Spirited Away, and I couldn't be happier. It is a bit like an Oriental version of Alice in Wonderland. A little girl and her parents take an accidental detour on their way to their new home. They wind up in the spirit world, and many strange adventures befall the little girl as she tries to rescue both her parents and herself and return to the ordinary world. Though the story is suspenseful and interesting, the beauty of the artwork is the true treasure of this amazing work. Highly recommended!
6305781427|3.0|Maybe I should have stuck with the CD.  The music and setting for Yanni's seminal concert are first-class.  The guy can indeed cover the keyboards, the Royal Philharmonic is the best back-up band you could ask for, and the \\"regular\\" back-ups aren't shabby, either.  And it's the coolest concert venue this side of Red Rocks.  But the unimaginative camerawork just about ruins the show.  There are precioius few shows of Yanni's hands on the keyboards, too many poorly-framed musician close-ups, and, maybe worst of all, little coordination of music to the video (e.g., when there's a key solo they often don't show the soloist). <br />
B0009HLDFU|1.0|...why shouldn't I be able to listen to the CD in any device?  <br />I own over 4000 original CDs, I'd think I am a good customer for the music industry. But I will NOT buy ANY copy-protected CD. <br />Even if the copy-protection technology is si easy to bypass. I mean, one should NEVER leave auto-run of the CDs activated. What if they istall software without your knowledge? (which is exactly what this disc attempts to do, by the way). <br />Don't buy these discs, and the industry will eventually abandon the technology.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Some people feel that there is no need for judgement after death, or a place called \\"hell\\" for those who fail the test....we humans create a very effective living hell for ourselves right here on earth when guilt and self-loathing take over our lives.  <br /> <br />So it is with Trevor Reznik. He has not slept (or apparently, eaten) for a year...he has lost 63 lbs. and looks like a concentration camp inmate. His eyes, mind, and life are a haunted, paranoid wasteland. Starvation, lack of food, and monumental guilt lead him, quite understandably, to hallucinate...but it is not clear where the fantasy ends and reality begins.  <br /> <br />As with most hallucinations, there is a grain of truth and reality concealed within each, and it is up to the viewer to assimilate the tangled visual inputs and gradually come to a realization of the true nature of Trevor's plight. We come to like Trevor, he is basically a good person, and I found myself sincerely hoping that his situation would be favorably resolved and that he could finally eat, sleep, and return to \\"normalcy\\". <br /> <br />I will not provide the answer to this question...to do so would destroy some of the suspense of the movie, but I will say that the ending ties up all loose ends (unlike so many psychological thrillers) and you will fully understand the underlying causes and meanings of all that you have seen. <br /> <br />I strongly recommend this movie to all who value and enjoy intelligent, challenging, complex stories such as Mulholland Drive, The Jacket, 21 Grams, and Memento....you will not be disappointed; indeed, in many ways it is superior to these movies. The acting, direction, music, and cinematography are first class, and the story line is absolutely superb.  <br /> <br />Take a walk in Trevor Reznik's shoes....it promises to be a haunting, memorable journey.
B00002MZ4W|5.0|I write this review after just completing my review of her first album, so if it seems that I'm gushing about it, that's why! I absolutely love this album! I can't give a completely impartial review of it because although I know both of the albums came out some time ago, when I purchased \\"When the Pawn\\" a month or so ago and listened to it, I felt like she looked into my mind and wrote down every feeling she found! I really like her originality and her refusal to \\"dumb down\\" her songs by using words people could sing to but that made no sense and had no heart. I admired her first album for the same reason. A couple of my favorites at the moment are \\"To Your Love\\", \\"Fast As You Can\\" and \\"Get Gone\\"- but for any music I buy, my favorite songs on the albums change all the time! Anyway, this is a more uptempo album than the first, and I know many people consider this substandard in comparison to her first album. I can understand those feelings because when you've<br /><br />listened to her for the first time, it really blows you away, and after you get used to hearing her songs and voice over and over again, the second album has the potential to be almost irritating because now it seems like overkill. Don't worry- this album still rocks! If you don't like the English language or if your idea of soul searching poetry is limited to Dr. Suess, don't buy this album. Otherwise, get it right now!
B000050FEN|3.0|This movie is still a movie...it is not a prophesy!  You cannot say man is becoming worse, and this movie signifies it.  Desensitization is not anymore apparent today then it was before.  John Doe throughly deserved what he got, the 'reasonable person' in the end would probably have done the same.  The filmmakers were wrong to talk of people in the way they did.... this wasn't really as intelligent or as insightful as it thought it was.  It is not 'disgustingly beautiful'? How can oxymorons exist?  Kevin Spacey's acting saved it...
B000002BE9|5.0|I love this album. It's really nice when you find someone who has been through the same feelings and crazy relationships that can express themselves in such an original way. I love Fiona's smokey voice, and I think what made me like her even more was when I read an article about how she didn't think she was much of a singer, but she couldn't imagine anyone else singing her songs. This album is very good, and although at times her vocabulary can be distracting, the songs are amazing.This is not the album to buy if you want a dance music-type album, but it is definately worth listening to. Her second album \\"When The Pawn\\" has more uptempo songs, but the same fierce, vulnerable and sultry spirit. Stop reading the reviews and buy the album!
B00029LNHS|4.0|My second favorite BEP album next only to Monkey Business.  With the addition of Fergie they are creating a better and fuller sound which they perfect in Monkey Business. That said I like every song on this album.  Having only radio to get my BEP fix previously it was unbeknown to me that \\"Let's get it Started\\" is actually \\"Lets get Retarded\\".  Now while some have found this to be offensive it makes the logic of the song alot easier to understand. If you actually listen to what the lyrics are saying it is not offensive at all and is a really creative use of verbage that we are so rarely treated to in popular music.  <br />A must have for the BEP fan and for someone who is looking for something smarter than the usual canned gangsta rap.
B000286S8S|5.0|This CD covers almost everything.  It has the old and some new and for those fans that are fans of both David Lee Roth and Sammy Hagar I highly recommend it.  It is like a mini box set.
B00005BF9Z|5.0|outstanding album, there's not a song on it I didn't like or don't listen to. I would list this album in the top ten I own.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|Wow, what a great record.      The first tune I'd heard from it (and the first Sufjan song I'd heard at all) was the title track \\"Come on, feel the Illinoise,\\" which was probably a bit misleading; with its busy orchestration and 5/4 time signature, it's the most uptempo song on the album, evoking the baroque broadway stylings of Rogers & Hammerstein.  Instead of an album full of such gems, it is rounded out by rustic folk balladry (\\"Casmir Pulaski Day,\\" \\"John Wayne Gacy, Jr,\\" \\"Decatur\\"), lush instrumental numbers (most of the ones with the really long song titles), and even an all-out rocker (\\"The Man from Metropolis Steals our Hearts\\").    Stevens's instrumentation is truly beatiful--a seamless integration of guitar, banjo, and various woodwind instruments that complement his angelic voice wonderfully.  The soundscapes can alternately evoke heartbreak, paint pastoral images, dig into a groove, or even make you want to get up and dance.    And then there's the lyrics--it's easy to just focus on the illinois-related subject matter, turning the album into a clever exercise of 'catch the reference' (or even more difficultly, 'explain the reference'--I have no doubt that stevens knows more about these illinois towns than most of their residents, myself included, as a former napervillain).  Still, to do so is a disservice to sufjan's elaborate songcraft.  Rather than simply a clever reference-dropping game, stevens uses illinois more as a context for his songwriting, then challenging himself to find someway to meld the ingredients into moving narratives on the human condition.      In my opinion, he succeeds in every case.      The song with the highest potential for novelty, \\"John Wayne Gacey, Jr,\\" is instead probably the most touching on the entire ablum.  Stevens finds a way to simultaneously reflect on the horror and tragedy in these senseless murders, yet also identify with the anti-hero, trying to imagine what could lead to such a course (here centering on urban legend that a young gacey was hit in the head by a child on a swingset), while also commenting on the fact that we all have our secrets to hide, some more awful than others.    Anyway, this record is an amazing accomplishment of monumental proportions (not to mention monumental song title lengths).  I'm interested to see if and how Stevens delivers on his promise to make a record for each state.
B000007MVD|4.0|ok so the thing is, if you like the beatles early days, such as everything up to the help album, you will absolutely love this!  I am more of a later days fan, but this is a must have if you are a beatles fan.  There is a lot of commentary, but theres even more music.  If you only listen to the later days theres pretty much none of that in this, but its still a great cd set.   I recommend this highly! <br /> <br /> <br />ps the only reason i put 4 stars is because there are no later days songs on it, and i happen to be a later days fan...:)   its still great tho, an early days fan would give it 5 stars

B0007QJ1MK|4.0|Few bands these days can rock out like Queens of the Stone Age. Having said that, it should be known that a main ingrediant of what made them rock so much (former bassist & vocalist Nick Oliveri) is absent from this album, as a result of a feud between him and lead singer Josh Homme. In my opinion, this record suffers from repetitiveness because of that. What made their previous album (Songs for the Deaf) so great was the diversity: one song would have Oliveri on vocals in a hardcore scream-fest verging on death-metal, then the next song would have Homme singing in a slower, more mellow song. They balanced eachother out and the album was the better for it, where as Lullabies to Paralyze is all Josh Homme. While that is not a bad thing in itself, it is lacking compared to previous QOTSA albums. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, this is a solid rock album, but nothing really stands out or grabs you. As others have mentioned, this has a more stripped-down sound. It lacks the dark intensity and production values of Songs for the Deaf, and sounds suspiciously similar to their original self-titled album. It's not all bad though, Lullabies starts off great with Medication (if you can't rock out to that song, you don't have a pulse) and continues the momentum with Everybody Knows You're Insane, but then loses it for the rest of the album in my opinion. Now, you may be wondering: why did I still give it 4 stars after having mainly negative things to say? That's simple: because it's Queens Of The Stone Age, and even though it may disappoint long-time fans, it's still better than the majority of new music out there.
B000002JOH|4.0|Pantera's second non-hair metal album, and not aaa bad one. Phil's vox on this album have become a might too monochromatic and aggro, when compared to Cowboys from Hell, though. The songwriting is similarly more catered to the aggro crowd than on Cowboys. Don't get me wrong, Pantera's thrash sesibilities are stronger than the nineties mallcore leanings by far, but the riffs are just a might too simple and chunky. Dimebag's leads are quite impressive, the man had a gift for pinch harmonics. Overall, a good but not great release.
B000268QB2|5.0|Keane are amazing. I first heard of Keane while watching Live 8 on AOL and the way these guys perform live will leave you breathless. Tom Chaplin's vocals are extraordinary, the piano and drums mesh together wonderfully, this creating one magnificent trio and beautiful music. Each song is so unique and beautiful in its own little way. On every song you can feel the passion of the band and their talent. This is one of the few albums I cannot skip through. I love and adore every single song.<br /><br />I must warn some of you. This album might not grow on you on its first listen. It definitely didn't grow on me. I bought it after falling in love with `Somewhere Only We Know' and `Bedshaped', but after hearing the whole album I was a little disappointed. Something just didn't click with me. Luckily, I didn't give up and on my 3rd listen I was in awe. It is now my most favorite album, one I cannot go a day without listening. This is definitely good music and it's hard to hate something so brilliant.
B00080ZG10|2.0|I watched this movie because I saw how many awards it won from the Academy and the Golden Globes.  While there were a few bright spots, it was much, much, MUCH longer than it should have been.  Don't dismiss me as the kind of movie watcher that can't stand a three-hour movie.  Some of my favorite movies are the historical epics such as the Lord of the Rings, Braveheart, etc.  However, this biopic just didn't have the steam to take me through three hours.  The best part of the movie was the acting. DiCaprio did a fine job, and I think they picked the right people for Katherine Hepburn (Blanchett) and Ava Gardner (Beckinsale, who isn't hard on the eyes, might I add).  I just wish it weren't so long.
B00004Y6NW|5.0|Simply put, one of the finest guitar picking albums ever made.
B00000DHTF|4.0|I revisited these recordings after Springsteen opened with \\"Back In Your Arms\\" (from disc 4) on Saturday in St. Louis.  There's so much to choose from here--many of the more subtle pieces didn't have a chance to grow on me--until now.   Some of the 90's era work already sounds dated, but otherwise, it's a strong overview from start to finish.  The music is satisfying, with portions of songs in different incarnations allowing us to glimpse Springsteen's approach to his craft.  Seeing him redefine himself as a solo artist live over the weekend, and listening to this broad cross section of his catalogue highlights how he weds work and creativity like no other--he simply has no peer.  With thirty plus years of the road and recording behind him, I expect we may see a second round of Tracks 30 years from now.  I hope so.
B000024C7W|4.0|Songs In The Key Of Life was Stevie Wonder's undisputed tour-de-force. With that opus, he mastered mostly everything he acquired from the four other classics he released in his 1970's prime: Music Of My Mind, Talking Book, Innervisions, and Fulfilligness' First Finale, and somehow covered all of the elements from those classics with two records. The production, brilliant songwriting, rhythms, and approach of that record was stunning and with all of those elements, he won tons of awards and outstanding recognition. I personally can only think of one album that can actually top that record and that record has to be his perfect 1973 masterpiece, Innervisions. But, four years had passed and many fans were waiting for a new album. Disco had took over big time and many R&B artists were just getting into that formula to probably chunk out a big hit. Stevie just had to experiment and release Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants, the soundtrack to a film no one probably ever saw. Secret Life Of Plants was the record that critics and most of his fans just hated. Some said it was a flawed album that was filled with killers and fillers. I'll partially agree with that. The Secret Life Of Plants is as different as anything Stevie ever recorded, but it is a great album. It's a moody concept album consisting some interesting instrumentals about plants. On this album, Stevie expands his sound by showing different musical influences from other places like Africa or even China, which makes it such an epic proportion. He also plays or tries many abstract instruments played from different parts of the world, even though mostly everything he plays here are done with synthesizers. There are lots of variety in this album: funk (Race Babbling), ballads (Power Flower, Send One Your Love, Come Back As A Flower) chants (Kesse Ye Lolo de Ye), rock theatrics (A Seed's A Star/Tree Medley) and even jazz (Venus' Flytrap and The Bug). I admire this album for its groundbreaking sounds Stevie patched out of various synthesizers to actually give us a real feeling of how it might sound in a jungle or even in gardens. They might sound dated today, but it's truly amazing of how he created them back in 1979. Just like Songs In The Key Of Life or Innervisions, he is taking us on a journey through the development and amazement of plants. That is really what makes this album special, even though there are some weak spots here. So, Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants is one of Stevie's more misunderstood and criminally underrated works, but it is an antonishing record that just takes you on a one-of-a-kind journey with amazing songs, top-notch arrangements, and mind-bending sounds. It's just a shame critics dismissed this one back in 1979. Anyone expecting another Talking Book or Innervisions will be disappointed because it's different and it would be advised for those listeners to skip this one. But, if you are looking for a more beautiful and experimental record, check this one out. B+
B00009V8Z9|5.0|Gavin Degraw is one of the most talented artists coming up right now. With skills on the piano and guitar, it is obvious he understands music and you can see his talent full out in his song writing. His lyrics need to be listened to a couple of times to understand because they're not of obvious meaning in most of his songs, but they all have great meaning. Gavin Degraw has an original voice that compliments the style of music that he writes. The thing that strikes me most about Gavin's songs are the jazz inspired chords that he uses in songs like 'Chariot' and the stripped version of 'I Don't Want to Be'. This CD never leaves my stereo. It's worth buying.
B00008BXJG|5.0|\\"Highway to Hell\\" is heralded by many as AC/DC's finest hour, and for good reason.  The brothers Young play with unbelevable skill and finesse; the rhythm section keeps every thing moving along with a sturdy backbone of awesome beats; the inimitable Bon Scott sings (or whatever it is he does) his heart out with a passion that very few knew he possessed.  All of these elements combine seamlessly to make not only an essential hard rock album, but THE essential hard rock album.  Kicking off with the truly classic title track, this CD at once grabs you with its utterly mindblowing musicianship, and leaves you wanting more once it's all over.  The songs themselves are great examples of AC/DC during their prime.  The milestone title track, both a fitting depiiction of touring in the U.S. and an eerily prophetic account of events yet to come is by far one of AC/DC's most popular songs.  \\"Girls Got Rhythm,\\" another fan favorite, features some extremely catchy riffs with the slyly salacious lyrics that this band specializes in to boot, making another great song that every AC/DC afficianado loves.  \\"Walk All Over You\\" is perhaps my favorite song on the album, starting off relatively slowly with a rhythmic intro that builds up to one of the fastest and greatest songs the band has ever written.  \\"Touch Too Much\\" is the unjustly ignored second single from the CD, and it too specializes in the raunchy lyrics that have made AC/DC the scourge of protective parents everywhere.  \\"Beating Around the Bush\\" is probably one of the weakest tracks here, but it is by no means bad.  It possesses another one of the best intros the band has ever recorded.  \\"Shot Down in Flames\\" is yet another AC/DC essential that has become an anthem for late night bar patrons.  \\"Get It Hot\\" is the shortest, fastest song on the disc, and though it's not as memorable as some others, it's still a decent song.  \\"If You Want Blood (You've Got It),\\" a classic piece that for some reason never gained the commercial success it deserved, is a song many believe to be the band's finest hour.  \\"Love Hungry Man\\" is a pretty bland song, but it is made up for by \\"Night Prowler,\\" a slightly disturbing song that features one of the band's best performances.  All of these songs make up one of the best rock albums to ever see daylight, and one that has defined AC/DC as a heavy hitter in the realm of music.  Unfortunately, the legendary Bon Scott would not live to see the ample rewards reaped by this CD, a tragedy that has left many AC/DC devotees stricken with grief to this very day.  While Scott's death was an extremely sad event, I'm sure that he would not have wanted us to mourn: his legacy was one of partying, rejoicing, and living life to the fullest.  So let us all now pay tribute to one of the few true gods of rock, not by crying or mourning, but by smiling, raising a glass towards the sky, and CRANKING UP THE VOLUME OF THIS AWESOME ALBUM.
0060555661|5.0|Some reviews have commented on how Zweig explains what Graham said, making it more understandable. Others have said that his commentary is not useful and is annoying. I would disagree with both. Zweig's commentary is not particularly useful for explaining what Graham said because Graham's writing is so clear and understandable that no further explanation is needed. <br /> <br />Zweig's commentaries are still worthwhile, though, because he makes the same points Graham makes (and also adds some of his own insights), but with modern examples. This updates the book and reminds the reader that everything Graham wrote is still relevant. No investor (or speculator for that matter) should be without this book. <br /> <br />The price of the book relative to the knowledge to be gained from it means that buying this book is one of the best value investments an investor will make.

Those are the high diva's. mariah compared to those 2 comes off a junior diva.  <br /> <br />Whitney has her signature song \\"I will always love you\\" <br />Celine has her signature song \\"My Heart Will Go On\\" <br />but what does mariah have!? NOTHING. She doesnt have any signature song , she just doesnt quite make it as a Diva, you know what I mean. She's always and will always be second best. <br />

Korean gulag system , and how these unfortunate prisoners  were systematically viewed and treated as little more than \\"tailless animals\\". Powerful study of survival. I could not put the book down.

B00004XPPB|5.0|An unfiltered FBI agent gets penetrate the dangerous web of a criminal organization. Based on real facts in 1978, he is godfathered by Al, a looser into the hoodlum pyramid. Against the odds, Al risks himself and Donnie ascends at impressive rhythm when he acquires an original feature before Sonny Black. Meanwhile his marriage sinks due the brutal emotional tension, he swims between two waters and the nerves progressively transform his kind character becoming him another member of the bunch.<br /><br />Interesting proposal, I think this was the film who revealed Johnny Depp as a solid actor, far beyond his previous works, this was a difficult performance with many inflexions and dramatic changes, but his countenance and talent made the rest. Pacino and Madsen are terrific too in this bloody thriller of betray and greed.<br /><br />Good point for Mike Newell behind the camera.
0743454537|5.0|I loved this book, the way it is told from so many different angles there is no way that you can really for sure side with one person. The ending was a bit predictable but even that could not ruin how wonderful and captivating this book is.
B000031WI8|5.0|Excellent collection of  Wham hits.  Great quality and I couldn't find a collection with all of my favorite songs in one place.  A must for any Wham/ George Michael fan.

B0009IW88A|5.0|This is by far the best Batman score to date. Zimmer and Howard capture the emotion and the hype of Batman Begins. Once you listen to this soundtrack you will appreciate the move a whole lot more. This is a must have addition to the Batman collection.
B0007CNXUK|5.0|This movie is one to add to your collection!  It tells the amazing story behind the creator of \\"Peter Pan.\\"  The 4 boys that influenced J.M. Barrie and the woman that he fell in love with, all helped him to imagine a story about a boy who would never grow up.  It is a truely touching film that will leave you breathless at its end.  Johnny Depp and Kate Winslett have incredible chemistry and absolutly makes the story work in the end!
B000000OQY|4.0|OK I never write on forums and such things, but I had to speak the truth about \\"One in a Million\\". <br /> <br />As far as the album goes, it is great and I would say side one lowers the albums rating from 5 to 4. \\"Patience\\" is an all time classic, as is \\"One in a Million\\". I believe \\"Patience\\" and \\"One in a Million\\" are the best examples of Axel's Lyrical ability.  <br /> <br />About \\"One in a Million\\": IT IS NOT A RACIST SONG. Those of you who think that are dumb and havent listened to the lyrics properly. My interpratation is the following, it is about a confused narrow-minded racist who falls in love with some one who is different. Not only do the lyrics make this blatantly obvious but also the pained and gravely voice with which he sings aswell as the slow and soft melody of the tune. It speaks of a racist character and as a study on racist mind sets it is simply awesome.The most important lines in the song are:  <br /> <br />Well some say I'm lazy  <br />And others say that's just me <br />Some say I'm crazy  <br />I guess I'll always be  <br />But it's been such a long time <br />Since I knew right from wrong  <br />It's all the means to an end, I, <br />I keep on movin' along <br /> <br />Radicals and racists <br />Don't point your finger at me <br />I'm a small town white boy <br />Just tryin' to make ends meet <br />Don't need your religion <br />Don't watch that much TV  <br />Just makin' my livin', baby, <br />Well that's enough for me <br /> <br />You're one in a million  <br />Yeah, that's what you are  <br />You're one in a million, babe  <br />You are a shooting star  <br />Maybe someday we'll see you  <br />Before you make us cry  <br />You know we tried to reach you  <br />But you were much too high <br /> <br />Nuff said.

B00068NVI4|3.0|The acoustic set is worth the the DVD. Most of the rest of the show is great but at time's Jon's vocals are so loud you can't hear the rest of the group. \\"And You and I\\" sounds the worst. At one point it sounds like the entire mix, except the vocals, are run through some type of limiter/compression. The whole mix of the DVD set is kind of small sounding. Sounds like it was taken from a board mix that they just couldn't get right.
B0002858YS|4.0|I am a new fan to this group - but they have real talent.  Not every song on the CD is for me, but a few of them are intense.
B00005JL9B|5.0|This is an incredible movie that borders right on the edge of disturbing and hilarious.  most of the time you don't know if you should laugh or cringe.  this movie IS AVALIABLE on Amazon.co.uk <br /> <br />it amounts to about 28 dollars with shipping depending on how the dollar is doing.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I listen to this CD constantly. Her voice is beautiful and the songs are nostalgic.
0451169514|5.0|I wont get into the plot, (I'll leave that to the more dedicated reviewers), but I believe that this book should be considered one of the finest horror novels of the 20th century. The plot, the charecters, the imagery- all show that this is the work of a horror master at his best.  Honestly, Steven King should get a pat on the back and his name engraved in horror history.. <br />  <br />I have read over 35 (no joke) King novels in my 17 years of existance and if I had to pick my favorites, they would be either It or his short story collection \\"Everythings Eventual\\".  Please read this book if you are a fan of horror... and stay far away from the miniseries of the same name.  Please.
630512762X|5.0|I have watched this movie over and over again, and it gets better each time I watch it.  It's very action-filled and suspenseful, keeps you on the edge of your seat.  I highly recommend this movie!  I love Nicholas Cage as Castor Troy and John Travolta as Sean Archer in this movie!  I especially love it when they switch faces and identities.  So cool!
B00065MDRW|5.0|I need to add this as a coda to the other reviewers who awarded this remarkable album five stars. I had the good fortune to see King Crimson in Boston many years ago as a warm-up band (believe it or not) for Yes, who were slightly higher in the charts at the time. What has stayed with me the longest is the memory that these are not simply studio bands, requiring numerous takes and countless edits to achieve the manic precision you hear on their albums. The brief moments of dead silence following the hard, abrupt cuts in the music is even more impressive in a concert hall than a home stereo.
B00000255F|5.0|I saw Bruce in '77 in College Park and to this day, his Born To Run album, which I heard live, is still the best music of it's time.  Lyrically it's unsurpassed, Little Steven, Bruce, Clarence and the rest of the E Street Band were some of the greatest musicians who graced the stage.  I felt compelled to share my thoughts which judge Bruce and the band on their music.  Unlike the nitwits who yet AGAIN drag someone's talents through the mud because they don't like their political affiliation.  He's a democrat clowns, GET OVER IT! Didn't we get enough lies and mud slinging from the disgraceful band of losers who wrote the \\"Swift Boat Veterans for UNTruth\\"?<br /><br />Trust me, buy the album, listen to the songs and lyrics.  They sure don't write them like that anymore, pure gold.
0380789019|5.0|I had just finished reading the Sandman Collection when the same friend that lent me those great TPBs, suggested that I should read American Gods. \\"But start simple,\\" he said \\"read 'Neverwhere' first.\\"<br /><br />He gave me his copy of the book (not the one I later purchased, but a big hardcover one), so that I could read it. Boy, was I amazed. I had read the short-lived core-book to the Underworld RPG (not related at all with the vampire vs. werewolf movie that White Wolf sued Sony over), and its author, Gareth-Michael Skarka, recommended Gaiman's work for inspiration; and also he recommended the old Beauty and the Beast TV series with Ron Perlman and Linda Hamilton. Since I liked the idea behind the RPG, and liked the TV series, and also, since I trusted my friend's opinion, I was more than interested in reading this novel.<br /><br />So, it took me probably a week to read it (I'm not one of those people that have the amazing gift to devour a book a night), and I enjoyed every bit of it. I'm not familiar at all with London, but its dark alleys and magical underground worlds captivated me.  Gaiman's characters were all very approachable to me. I felt that Door, and the main character, Richard Mayhew, were very likeable people. I loved the Marquis of Carabas, and was surprised. I liked, especially, that, in a way, the characters from London below resembled homeless people in real life. We walk by them, and pretend they're not there. In Gaiman's novel, they're literally invisible to us. I found this very interesting, something to ponder on. I also like his sense of humor. But, again, in my opinion, Mr. Gaiman's fort&eacute; lies in developing characters, especially, in developing villains who the reader can, if not empathize with, at least understand. This is shown throughout his work, in general, but Neverwhere is another example of this. I think this is a good place to start reading Gaiman, and I find everyone who enjoys modern fantasy will love it.
0802130208|5.0|Let me preface my review by stating that there is no middle ground with this book.  At least I've never met anyone who was indifferent about it.  You either love or you hate it.  While I'm firmly in the camp of those who think this is a comic masterpiece, I understand why those on the other side think the way they do.  After all Ignateous Reilly basically has no redeeming qualities.  None.  His absolute belief in his own intellectual and moral superiority, and his ensuing poor treatment of everyone around him as a result can make this a hard book to get into.  Consequently it can be impossible for the reader to identify with, or feel sympathy for, him.  But it's this same attitude that also gives the book it's greatest strength.  With this imagined superiority, Ignateous brings a fresh, unique & comical perspective to every situation he encounters.  Whether he's leading a rebellion against the management of a factory, attempting to start a new political movement using a certain minority group as a catalyst, or simply trying to work as a hotdog vendor, each scenario rapidly descends into hilarious anarchy as he loses control of the events around him.  Add the wonderful descriptions of New Orleans and its various denizens to the mix and this is a classic in my opinion.  Bar none!  In reading and re-reading this book, I can't help but wonder how many other amazing stories were lost because of the author's early (and self-imposed) demise.  But thankfully we still have this wonderful book as a monument to his talent.  And that will have to be enough.  The bottom line is that A Confederacy of Dunces is devastatingly funny.  Give it a try.
B00068TJM6|5.0|I bought this watch for the slide rules function on the bezel.  It is very handy for me in my profession to be able to do multiplication, division, ratios and conversions on the watch.

B000000Y1H|5.0|From the wonderful documentary \\"Straight, No Chaser\\", we know that the Baroness Pannonica de Koenigswarter was born a Rothschild, flew bombers during WWII in de Gaulle's resistance, then came to New York and became one of the foremost patrons of jazz, close friends with Parker, Thelonious, and countless others. Complex lady. Complex tune as well, and one of Monk's most beautiful. <br />This record was Monk's third for Riverside, but the first to feature his compositions. The title track \\"Brilliant Corners\\" is notorious for its strangeness of melody and its doubling of tempo. But the highlight of the record is the ballad \\"Pannonica\\",  for two reasons... first, Monk doubling on the celeste. I think it must be the only time he ever played another instrument on record, let alone two instruments at once, but he must've been aiming for an ethereal quality for this recording and achieves it in his intro and in his solo, where he alternates between celeste and piano. And second... Sonny Rollins. This was made during Sonny's high point, around the time of \\"Saxophone Colossus\\", and I think it is probably his strongest ballad solo, and the strongest saxophone solo anyone has played behind Monk, past Rouse and Johnny Griffin and even Coltrane. As great as Rouse is, whenever he is playing the tune, you can hear him get caught up in the trickiness of the bridge, and he invariably runs back to the theme for safety. Sonny, during his solo, has truly possessed and internalized Monk's composition, and brings all of his astonshing self to the solo. Doesn't falter once. And listen towards the end when he throws in those five consecutive ascending glissandos. Then listen to Monk affectionately duplicate them when he gets into his solo. Then listen to some of the other recordings of \\"Pannonica\\" over the next 15 years and you'll hear Monk working this phrase in again. A small, wonderful exchange between two artists. The rest of the tunes on \\"Brilliant Corners\\" are great, but \\"Pannonica\\" is one of those rare ones that is itself worth the price of admission. One can only wish that Monk and Rollins had played and recorded more together-- then I think there would be no question of Monk's supremacy in modern jazz or of Sonny's supremacy on the tenor saxophone.
B000060OFT|1.0|When I first heard of Leonardo Decaprio being Romeo, this sounded good, but everybody talking like they did in the play isn't good. It is just so out-of-date for everybody to be talking like that. Nobody does in L.A. in a 1990s' setting. That's the whole reason that makes it so stupid, that I wonder who actually likes it. The actors, like Leonardo Decaprio and John Leguizamo are good in everything else, except this garbage. Even the fight scenes {with guns} are hard to enjoy even when you try.
B00004T9UF|5.0|Shady is still ill. People say this is his best album. I don't. Its still almost as good as his first album <br /> <br />PSA 2000 NA even better psa <br />Kill You 5/5 one of the best songs on the album. About killing women. <br />Stan 5/5 very interesting song. About a crazy Eminem fan who kills himself because Slim couldn't write back. Dido helps. <br />Paul NA  <br />Who Knew 5/5 About how Em says its not fault that he told kids to do things... <br />Steve Berman  NA Steve doesn't like Em's music <br />The Way I am 5/5 Em doesn't like how people all want something else from him. <br />The Real Slim Shady 5/5 the funny song. Funny, but not as good as My Name Is. <br />Remember Me? 4/5 I was real happy to hear RBX. I haven't heard him since The Chronic. The songs alright. <br />I'm Back 5/5 a classic comedy. Similar to \\"Brain Damage\\" <br />Marshall Mathers 4/5 About Em's originality.Not really special. <br />Ken Kannif NA Not as good as the last one <br />Drug Ballad 4/5 Eminems drug problem. <br />Amittyville 4/5 w/Bizarre Em must have been high. <br />Bitch Please II 4/5 w/Dre,Snoop,Xzibit,Nate Dogg. Good song. Dre steals the show though. <br />Kim 4/5 Story of how Em kicks his wife out of his house, kills her, then drives off. Prequel to 97' Bonnie and Clyde. <br />Under the Influence 4/5 w/D12 not anything special. <br />Criminal 5/5 Best song on the album.  includes a funny bank robbing scene. Hes a CRIMINAL <br /> <br />My Top 5: <br />1. Criminal <br />2. Stan <br />3. Kill You <br />4. The Real Slim Shady <br />5. The Way I Am <br /> <br />I still reccomend this if you are a hip hop fan
B0006L16N8|5.0|I bought this album faithfully after I listened to their second CD, \\"A Rush Of Blood To The Head\\", and Coldplay exceeded my expectations. It expands in every aspect from the last one, including vocal ranges, instrumental usage, and lyrical themes/topics/what-have-you. It seems to have a slower, more calm feel compared to AROBTTH, but still has that that certain something that keeps me coming back for more.  <br /> <br />1. Square One - A spacey/alt. rock tune with a great bass line and drum beat. Lyrics such as \\"The future's for discovering/The space in which we're traveling\\" and \\"You wonder if your chance will ever come/And if you're stuck in square one\\" leaves you thinking. <br /> <br />2. What If - A slow piano/rock piece, asking the title throughout the song, \\"What If?\\" to certain life questions. Another thinker, and one of my favorites. <br /> <br />3. White Shadows - A catchy rock beat with such lyrics as, \\"If you ever feel like something's missing/Things you never understand/Little white shadows sparkle and glisten/Part of a system plan\\" One that'll have you singing along. <br /> <br />4. Fix You - Starts off with an organ and piano, with emotionally charged lyrics like \\"And the tears come streaming down your face/When you lose something you cannot replace/When you love someone but it goes to waste/Could it be worse?\\" A beautiful vocal song that I'm sure will connect with many people.  <br /> <br />5. Talk - Quick paced alt. rock with an addicting guitar riff throughout the entire song. Not one of my favorites, but still awesome. <br /> <br />6. X&Y - A beautiful song with a dreamy chorus, \\"You and me are floating on a tidal wave together/You and me are drifting into outer space and singing\\" that'll make you sing along too. One of my favs. <br /> <br />7. Speed of Sound - The catchy hit piano/rock piece and another 'thinker'. Though the piano part is suspiciously similar to \\"Clocks\\"... <br /> <br />8. A Message - A softer acoustic guitar song leading into thequick paced rock chorus, \\"And I'm not gonna take it back/And I'm not gonna say I don't mean that/You're the target that I'm aiming at/Can I get that message home?\\" <br /> <br />9. Low - Another fast-paced song with an experimental feel to it. Such lyrics as \\"You see the world in black and white/No painted bright/You see no meaning to your life/You should try... And all you ever wanted was love/But you never looked hard enough/It's never gonna give itself up\\" make it seem like Coldplay is trying to teach you something that they've already learned. <br /> <br />10. The Hardest Part - A sweet-sounding catchy tune, until you listen closer to the words, in which Chris Martin sings of heartbreak and disbelief. Still a favorite, though. <br /> <br />11. Swallowed In The Sea - A beautiful love song and another 'sing-a-long'. \\"You cut me down to size/And opened up my eyes/Made me realize/What I could not see\\". Catchy piano rock strikes again! <br /> <br />12. Twisted Logic - As the title implies, it talks about certain issues in the lyrics, like, \\"Created then drilled and invaded/If somebody made it someone will mess it up/And you are not wrong to/Ask who does this belong to/It belongs to all of us\\" Might not appeal to some people...depends on how you interpret it. <br /> <br />13. Till Kingdom Come (Hidden Track) - A softer love song with acoustic guitar and piano. A beautiful piece with a more traditional sound than the rest of the album, like \\"In your tears and in your blood/In your fire and in your flood/I hear you laugh, I heard you sing/I wouldn't change a single thing\\" <br />
0895260131|5.0|A classical liberal education teaches that one must be able to analyze a subject, study it from all angles, differentiate between facts, documentable truth, opinion, and fable, and rationally reach a justifiable conclusion. A classical liberal mind dictates to itself that the maxims it learned are to be applied in the real world, and to completely deny a documentably accurate description of events is the ultimate fraud.<br /><br />  Robert Spencer has put together an overview of how Islam has been understood and used by many of it's adherents in a manner that is highly detrimental, nay, deadly to those who did not agree with it. A strength are the quotations from source documents and people, and the references to other material for those who want to investigate in depth. Having read most of the reference material, this is a review for me, but it is a concise, fairly complete, and completely reliable review of many basic and irrefutable facts, quotes, documents, and historical findings. For those who are just approaching this subject, this is a magnificent first book.<br /><br />  I believe Mr. spencer is trying to achieve two very difficult learning experiences with this book. One is that there is much in Islam that that needs to be either deleted or reformed in a manner such that it cannot be reconstituted. Historically, every attempt at reformation, whether in Andalusia or Baghdad during the so-called and false \\"Golden Ages\\", i.e. every time moderate forward thinking Muslims speak out and make any progress, the radicals squash them and Jihad and Dhimmitude rule again with quotations from the basic precepts of the Holy Qur'an and the Hadiths and Traditions as their justification.<br /><br />  Second is that everyone should be able to openly and honestly discuss the Holy Qur'an and the Hadiths and the Traditions and the historical reality without being called racists and bigots. Islam, with all of its good, bad, and ugly needs to be examined in detail in the great marketplace of ideas. To present only the Islamic apologists side results in a very distorted and mostly false picture that is a denial of documentable reality. To argue based primarily on emotions, as the apologists do, is degrading. To argue that only Muslims can understand and interpret Islam is patently false and completely demeaning to all non-Muslims and any one with any intellectual honesty.<br /><br />  In order to ensure that everyone has enough knowledge to participate in the great discussion in the marketplace of ideas, this book presents an excellent knowledge base, and should be read by every non-Muslim, so they can understand the unbelievable struggle the moderates within Islam are going to have to wage if Islam is not going to continuously revert to the radicals views. It should be read by every Muslim so that even they can understand their religion and history as it relates to others and the radicals, as they are not taught this in their Mosques or Maddrasses, and thusly the moderates can truly know that they face a monumental, but necessary, task.<br /><br />  Sir Winston Churchill is quoted in this book. He foresaw the evil of the Nazis almost before anyone else; he forsaw the Iron Curtain and the evil of communist Russia almost before anyone else; he speaks about some aspects of Islam that must be reformed or Islam will always be a religion and lifestyle promoting and realizing the subjugation of women and non-Muslims. Churchill was the voice in the wilderness that was recognized to be perfectly correct just before it was too late with the Nazis and the Communists. Hopefully this book by robert Spencer will serve the purpose, since Sir Winston is no longer with us; just his prophetic words.<br /><br />  If moderate Muslims cannot win this necessary battle, then they must be willing to ally themselves with non-Muslims.<br /><br />  Hopefully this book will provide the vital mustard seed of reality that the Islamic apologists need in order to reenterthe world of reason and factual documentation so that they can join the battle on the side of reason and rationality, and not the side of the jihadists.<br /><br />  This book admirably suits the purpose as described above. It should be required reading in every high school, college, board room, governmental office, living room, church, mosque, temple, and every house of worship of every religion. The learning is not just about religion, but the way of life (Shari'a) that comes with Islam.lamic apologists need in order to reenter the world of reason and factual documentation so that they can join the battle on the side of reason and rationality, and not the side of the jihadists. <br /> <br />     This book admirably suits the purpose as described above.

0790729407|5.0|Neil Jordan always manages to make films that are edgy, pungent, and intensely accurate in defining the motivation of his characters ('The Crying Game', 'The Butcher Boy', 'The End of the Affair', etc) and in MICHAEL COLLINS  Jordan has not only directed but also wrote a docudrama that stands with the finest.  It is simply a major achievement in cinematic art.<br /><br />The brief life of Michael Collins (he was killed when he was but 31 years of age) completely changed the history of Ireland and the British rule of that country. Collins introduced the democracy of the Irish Republic and ended a long era of fighting and rebellion.  A man of passionate convictions and mesmerizing idealism and compassion, Collins' memory is still regarded by both the Irish and the British as a 20th century hero.<br /><br />The brilliant script is placed in the exceptionally competent hands of Liam Neeson as Collins with top flight support from Stephan Rea, Aidan Quinn, Alan Rickman, Jonathan Rhys-Meyers, Charles Dance, and yes, even Julia Roberts!  The fighting scenes are so well done they become artistic, due primarily to the constantly excellent cinematography by Chris Menges.  Elliot Goldenthal's musical score (with some added moments by Sin&eacute;ad O'Connor) not only enhances the film but stands alone as a fine orchestral work.  Truly on of the best historic films ever released.  Grady Harp, August 05

B000002KNI|4.0|Paul Simon -- great... Art Garfunkel -- oh, Art, you and your crazy white man's afro... but when the two of them got back together in 1981 -- goooood stuff. <br /> <br />Their voices together on \\"Scarborough Fair\\" still give me goosebumps, and by the way, in lieu of purchasing the album, might I also recommend the DVD of the performance. It's pretty cheap anywhere you can buy it, and the sound is just as good, if not better, than the mix on the CD. <br /> <br />That being said, there are tons of highlights, ranging from one of my personal favorites, \\"April Come She Will,\\" to the supremely danceable \\"Late in the Evening\\" to a downright funky \\"50 Ways...\\" to Simon's tongue-in-cheek comment that \\"the guys selling loose joints tonight are donating half of their profits.\\" <br /> <br />While I'm an even bigger fan of Simon's solo work, this is an awesome concert document that's well worth the purchase.
B00005JNJT|3.0|I liked it, but I can see how some may find it boring. The beginning dragged on WAY too long.  And the effects were SO LOUD. Maybe that was a movie theater problem, but I had to cover my ears during all of the action scenes.  <br /> <br />Katie Holmes served no purpose, and Cristian Bale was a really good Bruce/Batman. I have always liked him. <br /> <br /> <br />I cannot 100% recommend this movie, but in a few months, it may be worth a rental from BB or Hollywood.
B0007M22TI|5.0|I love is music. I first discovered it while flipping channel and I stopped just as chloe sang the song from the \\"Hunch Back of Notre Dame\\" I was spellbound. I watched the rest of the concert even the station's pleas for money because I didn't want to miss a minute. PBS offer this DVD as $75 premium and $150 for both the CD and DVD. Later There was a TV ad offering them a $25 each. On Amazon I got both for less than $25 plus shipping. The DVD has the entire concert that was shown on PBS plus Interviews that weren't plus Bios of each proformer in text.(The CD is missing two songs that were in the concert)I think what I like most about the DVD is the Audience shots their enjoyment just shines in their faces. It makes me want to go to Dublin to meet the kind of people who were watching that concert.
B00005ND42|4.0|Many pairs have given us some fine readings of Beethoven's violin sonatas: Argerich/Kremer, Ashkenazy/Perlman, Grumiaux/Haskil, Szeryng/Haebler, Mutter/Orkis, Dumay/Pires, Pamela Frank/Claude Frank and others - each with their own style, color and insight.  For a dazzling and spontaneous-sounding performance, Argerich/Kremer get high marks on a nice DG Beethoven Edition set which includes some great in-depth liner notes.  Then, the romantic master, Perlman teams with Ashkenazy to give some of the most energetic, bold and satisfying readings - with that penetrating tone and showman style that is classic Perlman.  Mutter and Orkis take a more daring, adventurous and romantic approach in their live 1998 recordings on tour. And so on.<br /><br />But, listening to the performances of Oistrakh/Obirin, you hear a different take on these violin sonatas - one of more serenity, lyricism and really gentleness.  What is notable about these readings is a consistent pace and more graceful tone to the music overall, conspicuosly lacking the more dramatic shifts in tempo and dynamics of other readings or that which one would nonrmally expect from Beethoven.  Not to say this team does not fire it up in the scherzos and fast movements, but it is rarely done in an overly dramatic way or for effect.  Also immediately heard is the ever-so beautiful and sweet tone of legendary violinist David Oistrakh which conveys a more tender side of Beethoven especially in the slower movements.  Perhaps this duo's tonally-sensitive readings helps us remember that Beethoven also had a really gentle, loving inner nature and was equally adept at poinant lyricism as well as banging on the lower register of the keyboard.  The tempos are overall a little slower, but highly poetic.  Occassionally in some of the adagios, the tempo is so slow that forward progression seems to cease.  But, this is the only minor drawback I see to this set and it depends on what nuances attracts you to the music.  The sound quality is very good and completely enjoyable but not perfect given the 1962 recording date.  Rightfully, ClassicsToday rated this set 8/10 for sound quality, but then gave it a top 10/10 for the Artistry category.  Also on the positive side is its low price for a quality set of all 10 of the violin sonatas - some $20 lower than some others.<br /><br />But, if I were to pick one complete set, my lean would be to either Kremer/Argerich (on DG's Beethoven Series) or Claude Frank/Pamela Frank, both who I think best bring out the passionate side of Beethoven but without losing the songful, tender side in the famous slow movements.  The Franks' set possess tremendous musicality and is offered at a really super budget price - a suprizingly exceptional recording obscured by the greater giants.  But the set that takes first place for sheer beauty of tone and lyricism is this one by Oistrakh/Obinin.  And while they may lack a little of the fire and propulsion that is classic mid-late Beethoven`in the later sonatas, their set is probably the most admirable one if you lean more towards more the subtle and sublime.  Perhaps Penguin Guide best sums up the story here:  \\"The 1962 versions by Oistrakh and Obirin are also performances to treasure.  There is a relaxed joy in the music-making and an almost effortless lyricism and an infectious sparkle.  Some might feel a lack of inner tension, but it is a beautiful sound in every other aspect.\\"
B0007GAEGC|4.0|I love is music. I first discovered it while flipping channel and I stopped just as chloe sang the song from the \\"Hunch Back of Notre Dame\\" I was spellbound. I watched the rest of the concert even the station's pleas for money because I didn't want to miss a minute. I'm giving the CD only four stars because the CD doesn't include two songs from the DVD and PBS program.

B000002IP1|5.0|In 1989, only a year after releasing 12\\"ERS, Phil Collins released his fifth album entitled, ...BUT SERIOUSLY. This album is SERIOUSLY an amazing album, focusing on songs that deal with the serious aspects of life, such as the poor as on \\"Another Day In Paradise\\", and a lost relationship on \\"I Wish It Would Rain Down\\". <br /> <br />HANG IN LONG ENOUGH <br />  This was one of the greatest songs to start this album off. The message in the song has been used many times over the years. That message is just simply taking great advice and making it big in life. In 1990, a year after this song, the all-girl group WILSON PHILLIPS would go on to record a song with this same message. That song was their hit single, \\"Hold On\\". <br /> <br />THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT IS <br />  Terrific song. <br /> <br />DO YOU REMEMBER <br />  A great ballad. Phil's ballads are outstanding.  <br /> <br />SOMETHING HAPPENED ON THE WAY TO HEAVEN <br />  Apparently, this is the only song on the album that is not considered to be SERIOUS. I guess Phil wanted to have a little fun, where this song describes a love gone bad. Is it about a love Phil had once had? Who's to say? <br /> <br />COLOURS <br />  An amazing ballad, and possible Phil's longest song reaching over eight minutes. One hell of a tune. <br /> <br />I WISH IT WOULD RAIN DOWN <br />  When I heard this song for the first time, I loved it. The music is just outstanding, complete with Phil's incredible vocals, a gospel choir, and Eric Clapton on guitars. I am not a fan Eric Clapton's, but his guitar playing is great on this track. <br /> <br />ANOTHER DAY IN PARADISE <br />  This is yet another great Phil Collins song that you will definitely hear quite often on radio stations. In this song, Phil goes into the depths of the needy and the homeless. <br /> <br />HEAT ON THE STREET <br />  A great song, separating your usual people of the world from socio-misfits. <br /> <br />ALL MY LIFE <br />  Great. <br /> <br />SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING <br />  Nothing special. Just an instrumental piece here. <br /> <br />FATHER TO SON <br />  A song where Phil gives advice to his own son. My advice is that all fathers should learn from this song and pass on advice to their own sons. <br /> <br />FIND A WAY TO MY HEART <br />  A great way to end this SERIOUS album. <br /> <br />    ...BUT SERIOUSLY had to have been Phil Collins' greatest album since that of HELLO, I MUST BE GOING! & NO JACKET REQUIRED. The seriousness to this album is so intense that you could feel it. Great album all the way.
1401301010|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. It was very interesting and as a chili peppers fan I enjoyed learning about the band's struggles as well. I was surprised at the depth of the drug abuse but it was a good read and I totally recommend
B00005J73X|5.0|I found this CD to be extemely uplifting, great music to listen to while driving.
B00007BKVC|5.0|I'd echo some other reviewers' comments -- why does this listing,  and why do some reviews,  describe a documentary and cast interviews and trailers and other bonus features to this edition when I and many others don't have these at all?  How is it that some people get fully functional or complete discs and others do not?  Caveat emptor.  I'm very disappointed to not have access to bonus features that I paid for.<br /><br />Apart from that, which is my main reason to speak up, there isn't much remaining to be said in this space about \\"Thelma and Louise\\", a movie full of wit, heart, intelligence, and great cinematic style. The audio commentary tracks are far above the norm -- Scott's is very informative and revealing, and the comments of stars Davis and Sarandon and  scripter Kourie are by turns droll and perceptive.  It's like watching this film with a bunch of good buddies.  Davis suggests at one point that she and Sarandon ought to maybe go out together and drive around and surprise people -- what a terrific lark that would be!<br /><br />An amazing and powerful movie that is every bit as relevant and emotive as it was in 1991.  (And this is a guy writing.)
B0000028M7|5.0|Well, that basically sums up DIRT, but let me explain why... <br />In the early ninties there was an enormous explosion of grunge music (a combination of post-sabbath metal, hardcore punk, and alternative) from the Seattle Pacific Northwest region. This music was very dark and depressing, but it was good, and at times could be very catchy. Millions of teenagers nationwide immediately became hooked to the angst-ridden 'Smells like Teen Spirit' by Nirvana, and pushed pop out of the American music scene. What SLTS did was not only destroy crap-metal and pop, but also make it so other bands such as Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and Alice In Chains here had a shot at the spotlight.  <br />    <br />Enter Dirt. This was AIC's big moment, and it combined the Pacific Northwest grunge sound with their FACELIFT metal sound. AIC was never strictly a grunge band, they always sounded more metal to me, but they still had the Seatle sound elements in them. They were dark, sludgy, depressing, and above all - INSANE! These guys meant business, and at the time ('90 - '96) you couldn't avoid their unique ability to make music. Layne Staley was a vocalist who had hit rock bottom, unlike the fakes Sully Erna and Fred Douche, and its even more sad knowing that his drug addictions would do him in in '96. Layne sang about drug addictions, grudges, despair, the hardship of war, and insanity, with a little help from Jerry Cantrell at times. And like many have said before me, it was the way Staley delivered his lyrics that made them as memorable as they are, he had an AMAZING voice. Jerry Cantrell was the one of the few if not only good guitarists of the grunge era, he made cross Hendrix-Mustaine solos, meaning they were very creative, but also blazing too. He wrote many lyrics too. My father recently passed away, and now I feel closer to Cantrell than I ever have before, because he too lost his father at a young age in the Vietnam war. Cantrell helped Staley with his lyrics at times, like in 'Rooster' and 'Would?'. Mike Starr made great basslines in 'Rain When I Die' and 'Would?', which provided a great rhythem section. Sean Kinney was the perfect drummer for AIC, he had very creative skills in the drumming area.  <br /> <br />Unforunately AIC would only stay in the spotlight a few years...When Kurt Cobain of Nirvana killed himself in '94, that ended the grunge era and brought AIC back to the seemy underground, which they stayed for the rest of their carreers. Another very unfortunate turn of events was Staleys overdose, after he went the band just wasn't the same (RIP Layne Staley). Jerry Cantrell has since gone solo and has had influence from his good friend and predessecor (Staley), although he isn't nearly as good as he used to be. If you like this, then get JAR OF FLIES, GREATEST HITS, and FACELIFT (AIC's metal album). Also get any other album from Nirvana, Soundgarden, and early Paerl Jam (their new stuff just blows). Well, I hope this helped.
B00000J2PH|5.0|I heard Smackwater Jack for the 1st time in `71 and was hooked from then on, I loved this album, almost every song on it is a hit. This lady needs to be in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame....what are they waiting for????? shes got my vote, get this CD you love it....

B0001HAISG|3.0|First off, the film was visually stunning, from the costumes, to the sets, to the cast, to the special effects, this film is pure eye candy! But perhaps I'm just blowing this out of proportion when I say that I was a little set back by the sensual/borderline sexual connection between Peter and Wendy.  From Bedroom eyes, to a \\"little kiss\\" that seemed more romantintic than innocent, to just the way Peter and Wendy interacted with each other, going beyond innocent puppy love.  I'm not a prude- far from it in fact (and I mean FAAAAAAR from it - *wink wink*)- But the relationship in Peter Pan between Peter and Wendy is an innocent one, and from people I know who've seen it, the relationship seems to jump ahead too fast, and at times even gives the sense of sexual frustration in Peter.  Although there are some that will say that I am reading too much into this, I can only say that the child-like wonder I was expecting to see this movie with, was replaced by an older person who was not only taken aback, but started to question why a grown man would spend his days chasing after a little boy- then the Michael Jackson jokes started coming: Neverland Valley- \\"I'm Peter Pan\\"- you know the drill.<br /><br />I will admit that I'm one to dissect a movie until it's torn to shreds, adn I'm usually the one to find plot holes that way too many movies have- I would reccommend that anyone who thanks too much may want to stay away from this film, unless of course you're into that kind of thing- to which I say- that's nasty<br /><br />Thank You
B0006SSOHM|3.0|When i got saw, i thought \\"Finally, a gore fest in a movie!\\",<br /><br />but there isn't a lot of blood in it. That was a dissapoinment.<br /><br />The story is completley dumb. I thought that the puppet was the killer. But it's some retarted fat bald guy. If you want a gore fest, this will dissapoint. First when you see it, you will want to close your eyes beacuse you dont want to see brutal, gory murders, dont, nothing will happen, it will censor it by going to another scene. Thats just stupid. Rent it.
B0000DZ3EN|5.0|I was only 5 or 6 (I'm 25 now) when I first saw this movie, my Mom told me that it was \\"the Wizard of Oz part II\\"- and immediately I wondered why Dorothy looked so different- and my Mother simply explained that the first movie was made a long time ago, and the girl who played Dorothy was too old to play Doroty again (Okay, so it was just a little sugar coated since Juday Garland had been dead for quite some time)- but that was about all it took- the rest of the questions I had were answered by the film, and any critic who bashed the film, or anyone who asked \\"Where are the Munchkins?\\" (it helps if you say it with a glossed over look of stupidity and a little upityness to your voice) should recall, if they were paying attention to the movie at all- that Doroty asks the same question, and to my little 6 year old brain, it was clear, something bad had happened to OZ, and it was up to Dorothy to find out. From the Wheelers, to the Lunchpail Tree, to Ozma, to Head Stealing, to Pumpkin Jack, to people being turned into stone, I was purely entrhralled just as I had been with the original movie, and Alice in Wonderland (the Disney version- the other versions just sucked)  The opening scenes are creepy, adn very disturbing, but they help reflect that as Dorothy has changed, adn the things around her are sad and dark, Oz has become sad and dark also.<br /><br />Faruza Balks debut appearance is a good one, but you might want to check out The Worst Witch, and The Craft- there's a weird connection between them all with the magic and witchcraft thing- But this movie is amazing- the only question is, what's up with the Nome King? He REALLY liked those ruby slippers- pretty strange- they didn't even go with that outfit :D<br /><br />If candy coated technicolor dreams are your thing- then just watch the first one and tell yourself that the whole world is clean and vibrant and nothing bad ever happens, but if you want to see a good movie, one of the few in hollywood that actually follows the original story as much as possible (which is strange for Disney) , then watch this one- it's completely amazing!follows the original story as much as possible (which is strange for Disney) , then watch this one- it's completely amazing!
B00003CY5J|3.0|This movie starts out slooooowww[...] stays slow for at least an hour. They definetly did not need to make the movie as lengthy as they did. I think about an hours worth could have been left on the cutting room floor. But the acting was pretty good, and I liked the ending too. And there was definetly some good suspense that had me holding my breath. I just recommend keeping your finger on the FFWD button for those slow as molasses moments where there is no dialogue or real action anyways... just Robert Dinero walking around town, etc. I would recommend this if you have patience and aren't expecting a lot of action or special effects.
B000002ACR|5.0|The Byrds fourth album in two years is perhaps the perfect punctuation mark to end the original lineup's catalog. Original Byrd Gene Clark was already gone, and David Crosby would be officially fired after this LP. The band was already reconsidering the pitfalls of rock 'n' roll success with the sarcastic lead-off single, and they'd clearly arrived in the Summer of Love a whole lot more experienced (and a lot less innocent) than the like-aged crowds to which they played. There's a somber, brooding tone that hangs over many of the songs, including Crosby's \\"Everybody's Been Burned\\" and Hillman's \\"Thoughts and Words.\\"<br /><br />It's ironic that the emergence of Hillman and Crosby as songwriters and singers provided the band with some of its best-ever material, while at the same time pressing on the fissures that would cause reconfiguration. Hillman harkens back to the Byrds' British Invasion roots with the twangy \\"Have You Seen Her Face\\" and dips back to his bluegrass background for the country-folk \\"The Girl With No Name.\\" Crosby's work, particularly the ornate \\"Renaissance Fair\\" points ahead to the sounds he'd create with CSN(&Y). The album's sole cover, Dylan's \\"My Back Pages,\\" is another perfect fit for McGuinn's voice and 12-string. The lyrics provide a welcome contrast to the opener, suggesting that the maniacal reaction to their fame was balanced by hard-earned self-awareness.<br /><br />There are few weak points here, most notably McGuinn's novelty \\"C.T.A.-102,\\" whose sound affects and alien voice haven't aged well (assuming they impressed anyone at the time). Crosby's discordant \\"Mind Gardens,\\" despite the author's love for his lyrics, is jarringly atonal among the rest of the album's tracks. The bonuses are nice, but not essential to the album's five-star rating. Crosby's \\"It Happens Each Day\\" and \\"Lady Friend\\" (the latter issued as a post-LP single) show him to have more good material than The Byrds LPs could absorb. An alternate take of \\"My Back Pages\\" is flecked with McGuinn intrusive (rather than propulsive) guitar playing through a Leslie Cabinet, and the final track contains an unlisted instrumental at 2'03.

6305657947|5.0|The Thomas Crown Affair is a well scripted, well acted and fun movie to watch.  The soundtrack flows with the story and you will want to watch it over and over again. <br /> <br />This is about Thomas Crown (Pierce Brosnan) a super rich finance tycoon that is getting a little bored with life.  He tries to escape boredom throughout the film by engaging in all kinds of extreme activities like speed sailing and flying gliders.  Apparently none of this is fitting the bill and he needs to find something else. <br /> <br />Thomas Crown devises a scheme to steal a painting worth $100 million just to see if he can do it.  Enter Catherine Banning (Renee Russo) the insurance investigator sent in to recover the painting.  She quickly surmises it was Crown who stole the painting and tries to catch him.  That is the gist of the movie. <br /> <br />The rest of this may contain spoilers.  If you don't want to ruin the movie then don't read any further. <br /> <br />Problem for Banning is that Crown is at least 2 steps ahead of her the whole time.  At points he is miles a head of her.  While she is tracking him he manages to return the painting either to hide it in the one place no one would ever look or because he just wanted the thrill of stealing it.  He also manages at some point to steal another. <br /> <br />This movie is fun all around.  It is only after you watch the movie a couple of times that you see all of the flaws and there are many.  The thing is it would normally bother me to see this many errors but in this film it is actually fun.  See if you can spot them if not go to the nitpickers website and see for yourself. <br /> <br />In the end you probably will come to the conclusion that the original heist and the ending sequence were all just a distraction so that Crown could have someone else steal the other painting while maintaining a perfect alibi. <br /> <br />
0783240236|3.0|When I saw this movie back in 1963 I was baffled and mystified. What was this all about? After I'd watched it on dvd just now, I was still puzzled and nonplussed. I still didn't get it. I think I thought the special effects, even in 1963, were pretty unconvincing. I still do. The movie is not well lit. Some of the backdrops are just too obviously fake. I know these were the days when movie women simply never got their hair mussed, even if they'd been pulled backwards through a hedge. But really --- Tippi's hair-helmet never ever loses that just-sprayed look. The dialogue is peculiar and forced. The relationships seem highly unnatural. What a weird household! The mother, a harpy-type from hell, apparently; with a little kid and a son who could be her brother. What is the exact point of the deaths of Rita Hayworth and the the chicken farmer guy? The mad Irish evangelist, and ornithological old girl in the Norfolk jacket? All the group scenes seem highly awkward and poorly directed. The idea of this ditzy dame Melanie --- who doesn't really seem that ditzy (in fact she seems exceptionally well-groomed, self-possessed, trim and organized) --- buying a couple of caged birds and driving 60 miles to surprise a fellow she doesn't know, and then not surprising him that much (all in an incredibly slow build-up): well, it makes so little sense it's incredible. In fact what in hell is going on here?     Perhaps Sun Tzu is on to something. Perhaps there is some deep, deep psychological key to this annoying non-plot and series of seemingly totally pointless and unexplained happenings. Perhaps there is a thickly veiled Freudian explanation: these people are all incestuously tied up to each other, and acting ultra-normal to cover up some hideous, sinful, hidden guilt. Maybe the little girl is actually Rod Taylor's daughter by his mother, who may be his sister, and Tippi could be Rod's other sister, and Ms Hayworth could be another sister. This is a small community: perhaps they areall inbred. It doen't look much like California to me, but I'm only a limey, and I suppose it must be. I really will have to read the book (which has to be set in rural England somewhere?), and study the dialogue much more carefully. Anyway, it's certainly an odd, disjointed, disturbing, surreal, and yes, memorable film. Perhaps it's in the same kind of genre as The Incredible Shrinking Man, which has no plot at all and consists of nothing but a man who goes on shrinking. Could it be retitled The Incredible Attacking Birds?     After reading Ken Mogg on Hitchcock, my head is reeling. It's all to do with Schopenhauer. Mogg has all the lowdown on The Birds (see his website).
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend who loved this series introduced me to it.  I loved it immediately.  The subtle banter between the characters gives each episode a comedic feel, but the story-lines are good and entertaining in themselves.  The story is both set in the future and in the past.  It brings an intriguing feeling to science fiction.
0060922583|5.0|The first 44 pages of Holographic Universe (first two chapters) explain incredibly complex subjects, quantum physics and holographic function, in a way that is understandable to an ordinary person.  The remaining chapters fit into quantum theory and holographic theory many different paranormal phenomena previously unable to be explained by science. A lifechanging book that I intend to reread.
B00005JMJG|5.0|I loved this movie. It was interesting and I loved how the process of deleting the memories was done, as in how it appeared in Joel's dreams. Very creative and hilarious. I also found it a bit sad how he would try to keep Clementine from being erased and in the end that they tried to enjoy the last memory together. I recommend this. It is romantic in a funny way. This isn't a cheesy romantic comedy and certainly worth getting.
B0000029DD|5.0|I just recently listened to Jeff Buckley for the first time, because of a recommendation from a friend, and am I ever glad I did. He was such an artist, so innovative, and absolutely unlike anything I have ever heard. This album could be listened to for months on repeat and you still don't feel like you're tired of it at all. Every time I hear it I appreciate it more and get something new out of it. 'Grace' really is a spectacular album. It is \\"so real\\" just as Buckley's song lyrics would put it.  <br />
B00005JNEI|5.0|Seeing this movie now, after the heat of the presidential campaign is long done, casts some valuable retrospective light on how we got involved in Iraq, and some perspective on the administration's curious relationship with truthfulness. <br /> <br />Some notes:  <br /> <br />First, it's completely slanted in one direction, so understand that going in.  This is not a \\"fair and balanced\\" view. <br /> <br />Unlike a typical news documentary, the key points are made through satire -- making it pretty funny in spite of the seriousness of the topic (except if you're a real Bush/Rumsfeld/et al lover in which case you will feel annoyed by it, and probably lack a sense of humor anyway so you won't be laughing, AND you will now click the \\"not helpful\\" button on my review -- thank you!) <br /> <br />For the rest of you... <br /> <br />Moore's points, which were much criticized at the time, are largely proven right now.  With what we now know, seeing this film raises serious and appropriate questions about the motives of the administration for going to war. <br /> <br />If you like Al Franken or the Daily Show or any of Moore's other work, you'll enjoy this. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />

B00009V7P8|5.0|This is one of the best CD's I have purchased in a long, long time.  Damien Rice is an amazing story teller, and has a soulful take on acoustic guitar.  If you like John Mayer, you'll love his music.  You really can't go wrong with this CD- ever since I got it, I have been listening to it non-stop!
0060976624|5.0|Christopher Buckley knows how to write satire that has a delicious bite along with the laughs.  Nick Naylor, our protagonist, is a highly paid consultant for the tobacco lobby that is thinking about cutting back expenses because of their shrinking market and lack of success on the Hill.  So, Nick decides on a plan to go on the offensive for the public mind and breath.  Unfortunately for Nick, his new public notoriety brings attention from some folks who have a rather aggressive passion against smoking.<br /><br />This book takes on everyone.  Lawmakers, lawyers, lobbyists, amoral businessmen who don't care what they sell as long as they get rich, activists who are motivated by a lot other than their stated cause, media types, and the public.  We all get it in ways that will make you say ouch and still find a laugh.<br /><br />Good novel that has held up well.
B0006L16N8|2.0|The pitchfork review of this album said exactly what I felt  <br />\\"Coldplay have risen to monumental levels of popularity on a potent mixture of nice-guy charm, serviceable songwriting, and general inoffensiveness. Unfortunately, these aren't the kind of traits that often lead to interesting music. Not that the band hasn't taken the occasional stabs at creativity and innovation; it's just that those attempts have always been carefully measured, or even nervously self-conscious.\\" <br /> <br />and.. <br /> <br />\\"Like Coldplay's two previous albums, only more so, X&Y is bland but never offensive, listenable but not memorable. It may be pointless to hate them, but with this album, they've almost certainly become the easiest band on the planet to be completely indifferent to.\\" <br /> <br />If your a diehard coldplay fan (I'm deffinitely not) then I would expect utter dissapointment.  The production is flawless but empty.  Some people say that Coldplay are just sticking to what they do best, create sappy, off and on insipred nostalghic music that sales extremely well.  The casual listener might engulf \\"speed of sound\\" while the more inofrmative one will see its lack of replayability.  The simple notion is that coldplay is well.... too simple.  And when anybody seeks to compare them to Radiohead it almost feels embarassing. <br />
B00003CWPR|2.0|There are some definite elements to admire in this film.  Kidman's acting as the apparent deceitful wife, the strong imagery, Kubrick's success in making the naked female body seem ugly (definitely matching what's going on in our protagonist's perception).  If the movie took place at the turn of the century, in Europe, and maybe someone else playing Tom Cruise's character, this picture would definitely be a masterpiece, and a definite addition to Kubrick's classics. <br /> <br />Unfortunately, the choice to do the husband/wife celebrity matchup and having it take place in 1990's New York makes the reality established in the film a bit implausible.  This is New York, 1990's, many years after John Updike and John Cheever, let alone decades of film of Suburban America that undermines a bizarre party/ritual so to say.  American Beauty would more successfully match 1990s New York than what Kubrick has created here.  There's too much European customery and attitudes, and too much sense of the original story's time period permeated in Kubrick's 1990's New York that it's too hard to take seriously.  Then there's Tom Cruise's schtick of handing out his business card saying \\"I'm a doctor.\\"  Maybe in turn of the century Europe where a doctor would always be deemed dignified no matter what he does, but in 1990's New York City?  No, don't open the store for him, yes, throw the John (i.e. Tom Cruise) into the slammer.  Come on! <br /> <br />Which is too bad, because Kubrick does succeed in creating a grotesque depiction of a man considering infidelity, and the imagery in the film gets high marks in depicting one man's psychosis brilliantly.  It's just the wrong setting for the movie, and the wrong actor (or at least how he approached the character) that gets in the way.
0553382179|4.0|I find this most useful because I tend to get sidetracked when I go online.  So it's a good quick reference.

0895260131|1.0|I got this book from a friend after I told him I joined the Army and he gave it the 'everyone should HAVE to read this' lecture. I read it, eyes almost rolled out of the sockets.     This book is a primary example of data mining: Purposely researching cherry picked information, out of context if it must, for the sake of demonizing a people, group, ideology or promoting your own.     For some reason, everything a muslim does reflects the entire religion. Thats like saying christians have a proclivity for genocide because the protestant Germans during the Third Reich had partaken in it, also the British with concentration camps in South Africa as well as massacres around their empire like in Australia, Iraq (Churchill gas-bombed Kurds before Saddam Hussein) India, during the Boer War, the Belgians in the Congo at the turn of the century, the Spanish and Americans in the new world, and later on the U.S. in southeast Asia (2 million dead in Viet Nam, Laos, and Cambodia). Just because people of said religion do it doesn't taint the entire religion as Spencer tries to conclude.     Besides, if Islam is so evil, why did the US support Islamic regimes in some places and not in others? Saudia Arabia and Iran are equally fundamentalist. Actually, Saudi Arabian nationals have harmed far more Americans than Iranians yet we still have comfortable ties with them. Theres also CIA support of the Mujahedeen in Afghanistan and Reagan's support for Saddam Hussein in the Iran/Iraq war to the point of removing him from the list of official sponsors of terrorism. Suharto was an ally of the US in Indonesia (Wolfowitz was an envoy to the regime) and slaughtered at least a million under the blessings of US presidents up to his ouster in the 1990s.     Granted, many Muslim nations haven't modernized and many have been secular to the point of being against their own people's wishes as noted in Egypt and Iran under the Shah. There are some examples of modern muslim states (although admittedlyflawed, but so are many other developing nations) though like Turkey, Jordan, Kuwait, and the UAE. Is the factor that these nations haven't modernized Islam's fault? There are plenty of other factors to consider. What about the legacy of colonialism that has stymied many nations and muslim and non-muslim alike? In some cases as Iran, the democracy of Mossadegh was overthrown in the 1950's by the US and UK to protect their oil interests and make sure Iran didn't become a Soviet satellite. There is also the coincidence that many muslim lands have vast oil wealth the west covets and thus demonizes any muslim nationalist that dares think that muslim oil should be controlled by muslims. (Note: that goes for non-muslims too, think Venezuela)     Of course, violent Islamic extremism should not be tolerated but neither should blanket anti-Islamic propaganda thats no less hateful and vitriolic than the KKK's terrorizing of minorities though Spencer tries to make a thin veneer of academic endeavor. Hating the entire religion isn't the answer, I doubt that the entirety of Islam is filled with the ranks of ski-masked mujid the media loves to show off. I personally know a lot of muslims and have yet to see one praise bin Laden. Even Cair.org, a group many conservatives and leftists alike see as just a terrorist front (its not) has an entire section dedicated to renouncing terror and specifically al Qaeda.     So, if you read this, buyer beware. Spencer isn't going to give you an objective overview of Islam but instead a bunch of moral equivocations and half truths that include subtle justifications for the killing muslims ever since the Crusades (case in point: he makes the Crusaders look like victims who were forced to invade the middle east, an area they had little or no reason to be in since none of them knew the language, cared for its people, and simply coveted its land with a little bit of convenient religious zealotry that like radical Islam justified killing in the nameof god despite god's angry decrees to the contrary in BOTH the Bible and Koran.     Instead of taking Spencer's word for it, explore source material. Go to Al Jazeera's site, read books on Islam BY MUSLIMS, it makes sense since few Christians read books about the bible written by muslims.
B00005JM02|5.0|This movie will be remembered for years and years to come. The story about a worried father crossing the ocean to find his son Nemo is heart moving. Dori, a wonderful character, has a special and joyful way to face adversities in life, an inspiring personage! <br /> <br />Every Family should have this loving and beautifully made movie. Pixar has done it again!
B0000029GA|5.0|I'm no rap or hip-hop expert by any stretch of the imagination, but I know good music when I hear it.  This is one of the few rap albums I feel is actually UNDER-praised, as it is a classic piece of rap that has heart, soul, and intensity.  Plus, Nas is never afriad to inject a bit of humor into the otherwise bleak record as well, tossing off lines in \\"Represent\\" like \\"Nas the kind of n***a that be pissin' in your elevator\\" that rappers like Eminem would die for. <br /> <br />Some of the tracks here are all time hip hop classics, and for good reason.  Those in the know revere tunes like \\"Life's A B*tch\\" and \\"NY State of Mind\\" - there's no filler or dud tracks here.  Short, sweet and to the point, Illmatic is the work of a hungry street-smart poet who ultimately proved himself to have more artistic integrity than his rival Jay-Z.  While Nas temporarily veered off into the world of Puff Daddy and guest stars galore on later albums like \\"I Am...,\\" thankfully he has returned to form with recent albums like the \\"Lost Tapes\\". <br /> <br />Illmatic should not be missed by any hip hop fans and most fans of any good music...  It's miles above albums like \\"All Eyez on Me\\" and \\"Life After Death\\" because there's no throwaway filler tracks, and probably the best rap album since \\"It Takes A Nation of Millions...\\" by Public Enemy.  Check out the 10th anniversary edition for remasters and bonus tracks, but be sure to pick up either edition.  Highly recommended.
B0000Y2XLA|5.0|this CD is a definite buy! It's the best cd i've listened to all year!!! No Doubt is a genuine, one of a kind, band! There are no artists like them! Gwen definately goes with her own style....she's unique, beautiful....and talented! You'd be crazy not to consider this CD.....
B0000070QN|5.0|Simply put, Harem Scarem is a phenomenal band who can do no wrong when it comes to creating hard-rocking, catchy, stylistically diverse rock music.  This is melodic rock refined by some of the greatest songwriters in ANY genre, and to top it off, the band is absolutely on fire.  Listen to Harry Hess' amazing vocals on \\"If There Was A Time\\" - and he says he was singing with a cold that day!  Or Pete Lesperance's smoldering guitar work on closing track \\"Had Enough\\" - brilliant.  From start to finish, this is an unapologetic rocker through and through, but is so melodic and jam-packed with great choruses and guitar riffs you won't be able to get it out of your head for months.  I just discovered this a few years ago, and boy am I glad I did.  Fans of Def Leppard, Extreme, Whitesnake, Hardline, Journey, Van Halen, Queen, and pretty much ANY melodic hard rock will find a lot to enjoy here.  Tracks range from Leppard-style arena anthems like \\"Stranger Than Love\\" to bluesy rips like \\"Jealousy\\", all the way to the acapella \\"Just Like I Planned\\" (my least favorite track, but still really good) and the slamming \\"Saviors Never Cry\\".  It's all over the map but still retains that melodic core.  Two thumbs wayyy up for this classic record. <br /> <br />Best Tracks: <br />\\"Stranger Than Love\\" - One of the best choruses I've ever heard in my life.  Nothing too intricate, just a great slab of melodic songwriting and the obligatory awesome solo. <br />\\"Change Comes Around\\" - Probably the heaviest track here, this one could go toe-to-toe with the Crue or Scorpions or any of the other \\"heavy\\" melodic rock bands. Great anthemic outro too. <br />\\"Jealousy\\" - Bluesy, great vocals by Harry Hess.  This track smokes from start to finish but still has that hit-potential. <br />\\"Sentimental Boulevard\\" - Should have been a #1 smash!  Check out that great chorus, and again great guitar work.  Sung by drummer Darren Smith. <br />\\"Mandy\\" - Soothing, note perfect guitar instrumental that keeps thealbum flowing seamlessly. <br />\\"If There Was A Time\\" - Incredible vocals, amazing guitar solo, and a chorus to die for.  Spiritual, hooky, original - there's so much to say about this awesome tune.  One of my all-time favorite Harem Scarem tracks.
B0000DZ3EA|5.0|This is truly a fine and comprehensive collection of one of the greatest musical geniuses of our time.The live release version of \\"Downside Up\\" by itself makes this album worth its salt.The rest is absolutley an intoxicating audio experience.I highly recommend this compilation to those who do not own a complete collection of Peter Gabriel's music.
0380789019|5.0|I've read this three times. Gaiman's writing just works with my head; everything I read from him goes straight to visual.  The characters in Neverwhere were full and colorful. I MISSED them when the book was over.
B000001ESF|5.0|There are two kinds of people:  Those who Love Rush, and Those Who Hate Rush.  Very few people born after 1976 have never heard this record, yet it is one of the greatest of all time.  The opening track is enough to be the masterpiece, but no, We are graced with such songs as \\"Something For Nothing\\" and \\"Tears\\"! <br /> <br />The first Track, The Rock Opera 2112, Is split into 7 parts, all in one track.  The first Part, \\"Overture\\" Is a mostly Instrumental section, a showing-off of Rush's talents.  The Second Part is \\"The Temples of Syrinx\\",  Which Begins.  The Priests are, essentially, \\"Big Brother\\"  and Control Life in The Solar Federation.  In The Third Part,  \\"Discovery\\"  We Enter a cave behind a waterfall, where the main character, (sometimes referred to as X), finds an electric guitar, a thing of \\"the elder race of man\\", and learns to play it.  Part 4, \\"Presentation\\", Is where he shows it to the priests, who destroy it, for it is not part of \\"The Plan\\" (Another Example of their control) <br /> <br />Part 5 is called \\"Oracle: The Dream\\" In which he becomes despondent and consults an Oracle, to no avail.  Part 6, \\"Soliloquy\\", Is where he speaks against life in 2112, and kills himself.  Part 7 is \\"The Grand FInale\\", which leaves much unexplained: Does the Elder Race Return?  Or do The Priests continue Their Universe of \\"The Plan\\"? <br /> <br />We segque into the unrelated \\"Passage To Bangkok\\", a song about drugs and the effects. <br /> <br />Following are 4 more tracks, \\"The Twilight Zone\\", \\"Lessons\\", \\"Tears\\", \\"And Something For Nothing\\",  All great songs,  deserving of awards in their own right. <br /> <br />There's not a bad song on this record.  Buy it and enjoy, it's not at all a waste of money.  Personally, It's my all-time favorite album.  This is good.  Well, what do you expect from Rush?
B0007GAEGC|5.0|This CD and that fantastic concert shown on PBS has started a wonderful revival of Celtic music in America.

B000000OAA|5.0|This is such a great CD. It has songs that were never even hits that you need to hear like Funster. You have to get this Queen CD and listen to every minute of it. It's worth it, trust me. <br /> <br />Best 2 songs: Killer Queen & Stone Cold Crazy
B000A88F22|1.0|This show is a good example of how Dave Chappelle's skit - When Keeping It Real Goes Wrong - is put into play.  Ridiculous dialogue, night vision cinematography and the tao of inane blather make for some of the most cringeworthy, pathetic and asinine moments ever to hit the small screen.
B0009S4IHY|4.0|This is one fun and strange flick.  I think it is best described as Kung Fu meets the Road Runner and The Matrix.  It has some wonderful visual effects, a fun story that keeps you guessing, and some downright silly fun along with a kind of violence that is so stylized that you don't really get all that upset.<br /><br />One example of a great visual is when one of our heroes is walking down a dark alley and we see a cat up on a wall.  As he walks by we see the cat jump out of frame, but if you watch its shadow on the wall you see it fall into two halves (and understand what that means) as a flying sword comes into frame.<br /><br />So much is not what it seems in this movie with so many inversions of roles that I found myself just sitting back and wondering what could be thrown at me next.<br /><br />Now, the movie is in Chinese with English subtitles.  I don't mind them at all.  But if you speak Chinese you won't need them.  But if you don't understand Chinese and hate subtitles you will be cheated if you miss this movie because of them.  Really, after a few minutes, you simply won't care.
B00005JNTX|2.0|Watching \\"Sin City\\" is kind of like dating a particularly bubble-headed supermodel. <br /> <br />Sure she's great to look and the sex may even be fantastic. But sooner or later she's got to do other things besides look great in clothes(or out of them) like, y'know, talk to you.   And if she has nothing to say that's a problem. <br /> <br />The problem with \\"Sin City\\" is that it has absolutely nothing to say though it admittedly looks great doing it.  Upon its theatrical release the film was lauded for it's visually stunning look and on that score at least you can believe the hype. <br /> <br />On looks alone, no film since the \\"The Matrix\\" has carried with it since an incredible \\"Wow\\" factor.  But \\"The Matrix\\" also had an engaging, thought-provoking storyline and well developed characters to move that story forward.   It is in these areas that \\"Sin City\\" falls short. <br /> <br />Part of the problem is that the film simply tries to cram too much into two hours.   The movie condenses three separate storylines from Frank Miller's \\"Sin City\\" graphic novels into one movie.  Big Mistake. <br /> <br />Any one of these stories alone would have made for a solid, gripping film.   By trying to tell all three stories in one movie, the film ends up giving these stories and their characters the short shrift. <br /> <br />Virtually all the characters, with the possible exception of Mickey Rourke's performance as the hapless boxer Marv, come off as underdeveloped.   Just because a movie's source material is comic books doesn't mean your heroes and heroines should be one dimensional. <br /> <br />Robert Rodriguez(\\"Desperado\\" \\"Spy Kids\\") is reportedly such a huge fan of Frank Miller's work that he offered him a co-directing gig on the movie. But in my opinion, the pair should have picked just one of Miller's storylines to focus on.  In fact, its astounding that the notoriously sequel-prone Rodriguez didn't realize that by not doing so he was squandering an opportunity to do two follow-up movies. <br /> <br />In closing, I'm left wondering why half the actors in the free world were salivating at the chance to star in this movie.   Perhaps the massive cast saw it as a chance to star in the next groundbreaking genre film, the next \\"Blade Runner,\\" \\"Brazil,\\" or \\"The Matrix.\\" <br /> <br />If so they lost sight of one key fact.  What makes those movies classics is that they didn't just have style. They also had substance.  <br /> <br />
B00005JNTX|5.0|One way that this film does this is by digitally affecting the film by providing it with unnatural color schemes that are identical to the ones in the graphic novels.  Now, the reality of the movie/genre/graphic novels, is a kind of hyper realism that doesn't feel realistic (this is fictional after all) although you know that some of the things that happen in the movie could happen and the film plays with these conventions well.  Noir is a genre that takes the audience into the mind of an everyday person and shows how they can be corrupted by sin, but still being a conflicted and basically good until their sin is found out and they're destoyed.  Well, in this movie there aren't many of these characters, most of them are sinners and gladly and accept the consequences indefinitely.  This is where the movie is the most interesting in the way that the color scheme both allows the action to go to extremes and get away with it because it presents an unreality and if you choose to view the perspective of the movie/graphic novel as the dream world of gritty noir characters than you have a good idea of what the film is like.  What's unexpected are how many portions of this film are so darkly humorous like when Benicio Del Toro's character is being drowned in the toilet by Clive Owen, it's completely unrealistic and we laugh at his plight because he deserves it and will do anything to get out of it, anything short of apologizing and backing off.  Yes, although this color scheme helps the film get past its aggressive, super-violent and gruesome content that doesn't mean you don't feel the effects of it.  They are still there, but you are always aware of the unreality and that somewhat deadens the effect and probably likens your reaction to the way the characters feel.  I felt the movie was as true to the graphic novels as possible even going as far as to call the movie plagiarism (That would be if Frank Miller weren't as involved as he is).  The movie is brilliant, if viscerally so, but although it is based on a graphic novel and anything slightly animated is bound to attract kids, this film is anything, but for kids.  I've mentioned the violent content without going into the more bloody details, but the sex is just as present and I'm not sure this dreamworld is one that you want your kids to know about yet, at least until they're older and have a better understanding of classic film noir, because as I said before this is a tribute and at the same time it's an update of the genre. Enjoy at your own risk.  By the way, I just have to give a shout out to Mickey Rourke who put in a great performance.  It's so big that it's almost too much for the rest of this film to stand up to.  I'm glad to see that he can still be used to great effect in films.
B0009P42S2|3.0|Much has been made over the fact that the director of Steamboy is the same who directed the anime classic Akira.  As a fan of Akira from way back when I first saw it in '89, I was expecting first rate animation.  Steamboy didn't disappoint me, at least not there. <br /> <br />Ray Steam is the son and grandson of two of Victorian England's greatest living scientists and inventors.  One day some mysterious men from the O'Hara Corporation show up on his family's doorstep, asking for a package that has just arrived from Ray's grandfather who has been away on an expedition with his father.  Ray learns just in time however that these men are evil and that he must not let them have the contents; one \\"steam ball\\", which contains within itself enormous power.  Immediately the action ensues as Ray flees the Corporate men to deliver the steam ball back to his grandfather.  We follow along as Ray goes on a journey to find not only the answer the mystery of the steam ball, but also the answer to the question: what is the purpose of science - power, happiness, or something else? <br /> <br />This is a very realistic vision of Victorian England combined with some fantastically precocious machine technology which was intended to make for a very weird cinematic experience.  Too bad that this experience was thwarted time and again by a plot that was stretched too thin and dragged on too long.  The pacing alternated between long, lethargic stretches of dialog and frantic action sequences featuring steamy explosions, crashes and chases.  This story could have been --and should have been!-told in about 20 minutes less time.   It's as if nobody was editing this. <br /> <br />(Director's Cut, you say?  I respond:  there's a reason that God gave us editors.  Make better use of them!) <br /> <br />That it is a superb  technical achievement, I can't deny.  That it is one of the most elaborate animes ever made (as the dvd back cover trumpets) is without any doubt.   A visual feast, gorgeous cinematography (animaphotography?  Oh well...), incredible attention to details, genius of direction...yes, all of that and more.  But this film should be a lesson to directors everywhere; the best visuals in any medium cannot compensate for or transform an essentially boring story.   <br /> <br />First, choose your script well! <br />-Andrea, aka merribelle <br />
B00005NC66|5.0|Chances are, if you are aware enough to be looking up this movie you already know how wonderful it is. This is one of the great masterpieces of both the French New Wave (nouvelle vague) and Godard (as well as Truffaut, who shares a writing credit). Both Belmondo and Seberg are well-cast and exciting to watch. Between Jean Seberg and Anna Karina, Godard had the good-sense/luck to work with two of the most beautiful and interesting women I've ever had the pleasure to watch. I will say that this film isn't for everyone, but for those that dig it it is timeless and breathtaking.
0670033693|5.0|This is a great read.  It has everything, great characters and  a  superb mystery.  The description of Wyoming makes you feel like you are there.  I learned so much about the Native American culture and traditions of the area.  I cannot wait until Craig's next book comes out!  Three cheers for Craig Johnson!
B00005JLEX|5.0|I wasn't really a big fan of this show but then a friend gave it to me to watch. I got hooked. I found myself laughing out loud at the t.v. which i never do. thats how funny this show is. Some really clever humour and twists on everyday observation makes this show by far the funniest American sitcom.
B0002S94OS|3.0|I AM a pretty religious guy, so thats pretty much the ONLY reason why i rated them a 3... i actually have all 3 albums and have had them for quite some time.  on a musical standpoint these guys are phenominal, the drummer (which was a friend of the band [who didnt know how to play before 'ashes of the wake']) is amazing... the guitar lines and outstanding (although not 100% original), and the vocals make it sound like he sold his soul to the devil (especially in the song \\"vigil\\" from 'as the palaces burn'... <br /> <br />i REALLY wish these guys weren't against Christianity so much.. I would never put the cd away if that were the case... it's just a little distressing to me. <br /> <br />BUY THIS CD (and their others) if you don't mind the \\"slaughtering of the lambs\\" kinda vibe lol... <br />  <br />DONT BUY THIS CD if your against the above ^^
B00000JG41|5.0|After Faith no More's demise was made official with a simple post in their website which read that the band expected to dispel all rumours that they were disbanding by,precisely, disbanding a guessing game started trying to figure out where would scattershot genius Mike Patton point his batteries to next.<br /><br />As it turned out he decided to rejoin his former crew, Mr.Bungle, in order to create their best album\\"California\\" in which an endless array of styles mark presence and where the band effortlessly swings, in a matter of seconds, from one style to the other.<br /><br />It all culminates in one of Patton's best compositions \\"The Air Conditioned Nightmare\\",a track that fuses breathtakingly heavy metal,surf,punk,lounge and even an arabic flavoring in the chorus.<br /><br />Every Faith no More fan should find much to please him here as long as he's not expecting the album to be as heavy as FNM's outings but I think this record remains one of Patton's most easily approachable works (at par maybe with \\"The Real Thing\\")and at that a fine starting point for the uninitiated.
B00005JMAH|3.0|Readers: I underline in this brief article, that this third saga insults to the author, J.k. Rowling, becuase it aparts from the original story, by minuscle details, such as Bucrbear, which is hypograph, not a hybrid, due there is great difference between both of them. <br />Another mayuscle mistake is that the Huflephuf's searcher is designed her as man and that's a big default in the Fourth Saga. <br />Finally, one of the worst mistakes, was the ending, because it designs that the finish should have ended in the train when the litle lechuza Pigwiggeon and not with Harry in his fire's arrow. <br />Good cinematography and worthable cast makes the rest but I guess definitively this entry was not the most inspired, pitifully.
B00004YW6I|5.0|P.J.Harvey has from the start built her own universe and gravitated in it, occasionally descending to our realm to present us with some of rock's most skewed and challenging records or to collaborate with like minded foils  in a visceral (Josh Homme) or poignant (Nick Cave) manner.<br /><br />So, the raw nature of most of her albums makes the polished, almost poppy sound of \\"Stories from the city, stories from the Sea\\" all the more intriguing (as it was produced by herself it was probably deliberate).Granted that there are several cuts that resemble her older self but almost everything here seems to be filtered through a more good natured light, which results in a record notably different from everything she's done.<br /><br />Tough the distinct approach than that of other albums may scare off some old fans I think that Polly Jean's bet on a more pop and song oriented recording has more than paid off has she's already reaped the reward from expanding her sound in the form of a larger crowd and a Mercury Prize for best album of the year, proof that an artist can evolve without betraying its origins (her follow up \\"Uh Huh Her\\" successfully incorporates her two sides).
B00005JNTX|4.0|I saw Sin City twice in theaters and obviously it's a great flick.  But is anyone else sensing the double-dip with this DVD??  I mean c'mon... Robert Rodriguez, Frank Miller, and Quentin Tarantino in the directors' chairs along with Bruce Willis, Mickey Rourke, Clive Owen, Jessica Alba, Michael Clarke Duncan, Rutger Hauer, Rosario Dawson, etc etc on screen the only special feature Dimension can muster is one featurette??  I don't think so.  I will be buying Sin City, but I guess not for at least another couple of months.

0876855575|5.0|While I understand that this will probably not becoming required reading - I think most pass over this incredible work without giving it much thought.  Charles Bukowski has given us an extraordinary diagnosis of the human condition through a look back at his own life.  Though claiming to be an apolitical figure, Charles sees the crap of life like a flashlight through pantyhose... easily.   <br /> <br />For anyone interested in other works - this is a gateway drug.  It helps to see who the man is (even if it is amplified a bit).  Beware, he is an addictive author... maybe that's why he is the most shop-lifted author on the planet.
B00008DDSC|5.0|Through the years I have watched James Spader bloom on the screen, from that beautiful wide eyed lad to a handsome mature man. He can be the ideal lover women dream of or the villain we love to hate, he does it all with such superb confidence. Through those whispery tones in his voice and those sensual eyes with the deep methodical stares.  <br /> <br />I feel he brings an aura of sexual magnetism to most of the characters he portrays. And he sure brought the spice into this film. I often wonder how much of his acting expertise does he use to achieve that charismatic illusion, or does that intoxicating magnetic energy just flow from him naturally? <br /> <br />I loved this movie with him and Maggie Gylanhall and I feel considering the sexual nature of the material it was played with very good taste. The movie was marvelous because both actors together, made it work so well.  <br /> <br />The ending was so deliscious!
B0007YMUZW|5.0|This is an excellent album full of melodic hooks and inspiring lyrics.  It is one of those albums that has really grown on me and I continue to be amazed with the tunes.  A must have for any fan of music.
B0009S4IHY|3.0|this movie doesn't have much of a story line... and it feels kind of arbitrary.  however, if you are into entertainment and special effects, then you may still like the movie.    for people looking for a storyline, Stephen Chow's shaolin soccer could be a better bet.
B000002JNJ|5.0|I grew up learning drums to this album back in 1995 but had lost it somewhere. Stoked to get it back. Such a good album, one of Pantera's finest in my opinion.
B000AP04MO|4.0|Finally, \\"Two for the Road\\" is available on DVD. I've worn my poor VHS copy to death. This is very underrated Audrey and very underrated Donen. The film tosses traditional linear narrative out the window as it examines a 12-year marriage by intercutting scenes from several different European vacations taken by the central couple, played by Hepburn and Albert Finney. It's all linked together masterfully (no Donen film was better cut than this one) into a movie that offers a fresh perspective on the \\"woman's film\\" (the critical community's perjorative term for anything that doesn't deal with war, politics, espionage, crime, or some other stereotypically 'male' arena) and a unique insight into what happens AFTER the 'happy ending' that concludes most other romantic films. Plus it's one of the few films in her canon in which Audrey plays opposite a leading man who isn't WAY too old for her. A must for her fans.
B00004XQ83|5.0|Exceptional clarity on soundtrack; variety of music from primitive to more standard bluegrass.  Enjoy listening to it in the car.
B00004RXVW|5.0|Sam Sutherland's mistakes are inexcusable for a professional critic. As another reviewer pointed out,Mr. Sutherland's translations are incorrect and distort the meaning of the songs.In addition,there is no \\"forcible rape\\"in the video. There is a rather campy scene of simulated consentual S&M anal sex.Till wears an obviously fake exaggerated rubber dildo that spews liquid around the stage and over himself. The scene is definitely played for laughs. <BR>Is this suitable for children? No. But it is not meant for children.It is meant for teens and other adults.<BR>I am a 54 year old grandmother who NEVER watches anything with sadistic sex or sadistic violence of any kind, and I am VERY strict about following age/content guidelines with children.<BR>That said,this video is just incredibly good.The music is first rate and the stage performance is electrifying. This is the best performance I have ever seen and I recommend it to anyone who appreciates great music and superlative theater. You will not be disappointed.<BR>I envy anyone who has ever seen Rammstein live, but at least we fans are fortunate that this video is available. <BR>Don't be afraid to buy the video. It is worth every penny and it will bear repeated viewings without becoming boring.
B000060P79|1.0|Ok, Simple Plan, is simply don't buy it. They may play their own instruments, but that doesn't mean they are great. Their album names are lame and not creative at all. it sucks, really. there are so many other bands out there to listen too. i don't seem enthralled with this band, i don't think they have much to work with. also they play on TRL so much, which is not such a acomplishment. They aren't really that 'punk-rock'.. come on. with those dumb titles?! really, get serious. real punk rockers would puke all over this. they'd be ashamed. if you like them, well you do, but i sure don't. check out other bands, and maybe you'll find this CD, eventually.. getting to the back of that shelf of yours.
B00003CWRX|4.0|For a fundamentally misleading work, Michael Mann's The Insider is striking, sometimes searing experience. Sitting engulfed in the cold inferno that propels the narrative is never less than compelling. When it came out I was gladdened by the almost universally positive notices it garnered. But I was also left with a sense of unease. The Insider was being praised for all the wrong reasons; as an expose of Big Tobacco, a critique of corporate malfeasance, commentary on the conflict of a profit motivated media. Mann's picture poses as tract on all of the above and emerges an unremarkable pamphlet. That's a shame. Film criticism completes a film, explores it, engages it in a dialectic; only at its lowest level is it a score card to guide the masses to the multiplexes. The dumb approval of Mann's melancholy aria was something like a dismissal. <br /> <br />If anything Mann is soft on his primary target, CBS news. American mass media is a grotesque monster; a mechanized beast peddling sellable bigotry because the persistent anxiety that generates grabs more attention and keeps more people \\"tuned in\\". It, or rather they, do this with an audacity that somehow never finds inches or air time for simple facts that disrupt the noisy harangues they sell as news. The Insider accepts the sanctimonious blowhards of 60 minutes as people with ideals of integrity who are well outside this culture and are only temporarily compromised by corporate pressure. This is not a \\"media expose\\". <br /> <br />As for Big Tobacco, well, taking them on in the court of public opinion is not a brave choice (as opposed taking them on legally which, as evinced here, can be quite hazardous). Besides, it is doubtful that the urbane and intense author of Heat and Thief has suddenly decided to dedicate his work to the already effective efforts of the moralistic nanny state, majority alliance for healthful coercion.  <br /> <br />Once the fog of \\"issues\\" is cleared, The Insider becomes the film implied by its individual properties; the metallic cinematography, Lisa Gerrard's longing, desolate vocals on the soundtrack, the intense medium close-ups of the etched expressions of the middle-aged actors. The characters had been alive before the events of the film's narrative, and the accumulated weight of years of anxious compromise are immediately visible in the domestic scenes which blend the voyeuristic familiarity of the popular handheld technique with icy color tones held for long takes. These scenes are punctuated with scant, hesitant dialogue. The camera's intrusiveness finds only silence and loneliness. <br /> <br />The film is far more pessimistic than is apparent on its superficial \\"issue\\" level. It gets mileage out of the Al Pacino's former radical turned honest professional. But consider the character closely and you'll find that his triumph comes only after he accepts his own helplessness in the larger scheme of things. When he's told that towards the end that he won, he agrees only to add, \\"What did I win?\\" It's as if the elaborate machinations of the case, the entire elaborate narrative have been helpfully concealing a great dread that must be faced once those events resolve themselves, be that with success of failure. This dread is even more evident in the Crowe character, whose life, pictured briefly before the media storm at the center of this narrative, is a bourgeois existence drained of joy or purpose. One should not forget that is he who sets these events in motion as a \\"man of science\\" who took the money, the car, and the benefits. The fact that he sold out to the tobacco industry rather than a more neutral but equally anonymous corporate colossus is significant, but ultimately secondary. <br />That this is a better film at the character level than at the grand level of political discourse should come as no surprise. The dissection of The Insider binds it to another of Michael Mann's films, 1995's Heat. Indeed the qualities that make The Insider a goodfilm are the same ones that made Heat a great one. The characters in both films are engaged in complex plans to change their quietly painful solitude only to find themselves bound to it, as much by their inability to communicate as by the inert urban wastelands that surrounds them.  <br /> <br />Transplanting the theme of existential loneliness from a crime picture to a legal one could have intensified audience identification with the characters; instead it allowed some of the empathy to be channeled into worthy abstractions about big tobacco and the press. This is not an argument against the \\"issue\\" picture; it's just that Mann's films are that much more powerful when the sum of the parts is not determined beforehand (notice the odd outcome of his Ali biopic where he was tied down by biographical baggage). The picture does arouse great sympathy for the Crowe character caught in a frightening, corporately guided bureaucracy that makes this almost the humane version of Kafka's The Trial. Like Kafka, Mann seems to be, in this age of post-modern artistic cowardice, a modernist looking for a perspective of the urban system he sketches. Unlike Kafka (or Kubrick, who should have filmed Kafka) Mann's is not detached enough to make the grand issue picture. As this fine film demonstrates, and as Heat did so well before it, Mann's urban wasteland retains a humanity that is conspicuous by its absence within the frame. But it is always palpable, threatening to burst into violence.             <br />
1563890119|3.0|Neil Gaiman, Sandman: Preludes and Nocturnes (Vertigo, 1995)<br /><br />Before Neil Gaiman made himself into a household name with the twin publications of American Gods and Good Omens, there was already a sizable culture of Gaiman fanatics thanks to the Sandman series of graphic novels. Preludes and Nocturnes is the first of them. Not only Gaiman, but his publisher as well, caution the reader in forewords (and Gaiman reiterates in an afterword) that Preludes and Nocturnes is not indicative of the quality of the series as a whole, and judging by the fanaticism of the Gaiman army, I'm going to hazard a guess as to the truth of that statement.<br /><br />Preludes and Nocturnes is a basic quest storyline; the sandman has been trapped for sixty years, and the items that gave him power have been scattered throughout the multiverse. He's got to get them back. Hooray. We've seen it all a thousand times before. What shows that there's the potential for this to be great stuff is what Gaiman does with some of his minor characters. John Constantine makes a quick stop in, which is always welcome, but the series' true brilliance manifests itself in the character of John Dee (one wonders whether he's supposed to actually be the well-known magician of that name, or just a reference to same). Dee is as well-fleshed a character as any in American Gods, which is quite saying something, and the lengths to which he'll go to abuse the power he has stolen from the sandman's artifact are truly chilling. The \\"24 Hours\\" chapter here will stay with you long after you've finished reading this and gone on to the other (hopefully better) books in the series.<br /><br />Not, by all accounts, an auspicious beginning, but I'll keep going and see if the legions of crazed fans are right about how good this gets. ***
B0000634EV|4.0|I have never really wanted to write a review, but I just wanted to say how much I really liked this album. One song in paticular has me obsessed. \\"Lies, I Don't Know What They Say But...\\" is utterly entrancing. I feel as though this is Phil best song on the CD. Pepper and Rex play perfectly together. I just can't say enough good things about this CD. You can't peg it as a Pantera or COC or any of the other members other bands. It's just Down.
0385338686|2.0|As a big Sophie Kinsella fan, I was quite disappointed in this recent release. Normally, I can not put her books down, but it took me more than a week to read this recent release.
B0009HLDFU|4.0|The new Foo Fighters album is excellent. Dave Grohl said that he wanted \\"In Your Honour\\" to be the album the Foo Fighters were remembered for, when kids asked who they were is years to come, and with an album like that I dont think they will be forgotten easily!Also the acousic c.d brings out the mellower side of the Foo Fighters.
B0009NSE1K|4.0|Everything this band puts out rocks. I don't know how they still keep it interesting, but they do. Solid release. The digipak gatefold packaging is killer.
B000A6T262|5.0|please note that the image on display is incorrect as of the 10th August.  I have told amazon about this a few weeks ago but they still have not removed it.
B00000IN5G|5.0|I've always liked Children of Bodom. Ever since I first heard the opening lines to Warhearts back in the day I've been a fan. \\"From now on we are enemies, you and I.\\" Of all the albums CoB have released this is probably their best, as it was released before they experienced the massive influx of fans that they now have. The sound is true Bodom without other influences. Children of Bodom's combination of sweeping keyboards, hyperspeed guitars and solid rhythm section truly make Hatebreeder an album to remember. <br /> <br />Alexi Laiho, despite looking like a girly pretty boy much of the time, is a metal machine, belting out his signature vocals and guitar runs with pinpoint precision. You have to admire him for his love of music, as he dropped out of school to play in his own band he created. Now this might have some sort of correlation with the lyrics... I don't know if it's because English is not his native language (although he does love the word f*cking, which you would conclude if you have ever seen them live) or because his education in school was limited, but CoB's lyrics for the most part are pretty shallow and ridiculous. I really like the thrash influences Alexi puts into the guitar parts, as the shredding really goes well with the scales and melodic solos that are dispersed throughout the songs. <br /> <br />I'm not a fan of keyboard in most bands (for example I'm not a huge Nightwish fan) but for the most part CoB uses them properly. It does bug me, however, when they use effects to make the keyboards sound like a guitar. If you want to have a guitar sound, play a guitar instead of simulating one. That's the same reason real drummers are better than drum machines. You just can't imitate the real thing.  <br /> <br />The bass playing on the album is a definite high point, and I love it when bands give the bass an empty space for them to showcase their sound. There aren't many things cooler than a naked bass line at super speed. Bass has always been a strong point in Children of Bodom, from Something Wild all the way up to Hatecrew Deathroll (or Trashed, Lost, & Strung Out, if you consider EP's) <br /> <br />It's really hard to classify CoB under just one category. Some call them Black Metal, (which they are not, although they have influences) while others say they are Melodic Death (also possible, as they play with melodies and keyboards a lot.) Personally I don't know where to place them. (Their CD's are between Immortal's and Nile's in my CD collection, if that makes any sense.)  <br /> <br />The CD is a little on the short side, with only 9 songs coming in at 38:06. This is fine though, as CD's like this (much like Slayer's Reign in Blood) tend to work best when they are not to long. 38 minutes gives you enough time to thoroughly enjoy what the album has to offer, but not so long that it gets boring and repetitive. Usually I enjoy the shorter albums (30-50 minutes) more, as that prevents the album from getting repetitive and boring (this is still possible if the band sucks...) Epic albums do have a place in metal however, but the sound, the setting, and the mood all have to be properly implemented to ensure a memorable experience. <br /> <br />I highly recommend this album to everybody who has been sitting on the fence deciding whether or not to listen to Children of Bodom. If you want pure CoB, give this album a chance. If you want to start with something a little more easily accessible though, I suggest giving Hatecrew Deathroll a shot first. <br /> <br />\m/ Enjoy
1400049628|5.0|This has to be one of the greatest books I've ever read! Very nicely laid out and planned. Ease of read and well, I've got an overly active imagination so that only helps matters. :) Definatly a handy survival guide to have on hand in nearly any situation.
B00003CXCT|5.0|I was too young to see Star Wars in the movie theatre. What is not to like in any of the original saga. I still remember how stunned I was to learn that Luke's father was Darth Vader and was hoping he would actually \\"see\\" his father in Return of the Jedi. I have no shame in admitting that I cried when Darth Vader died saving his son from the emperor. The space ships, battles, Luke coming of age and Han Solo's reluctance to help the Rebellion were all fantastic. My brother and I were a pain to my father when the action figures and the ships entered the toy market (we still have the millenium falcon). This is a classic that everyone who is a fan of Star Wars should own. Almost 20 years since the orginal Star Wars was released and amazingly nothing is cheesy, outdated or dumb on this brilliant masterpiece by George Lucas. I wasnt really to keen on Empire Strikes back because Han Solo gets frozen, Luke looses his hand and for a short while it looked like the Empire was going to win. But I guess I should of known being that the title gives you a clue \\"Empire Strikes Back.\\" Return of the Jedi was my favorite. The opening seen of Han Solo getting rescued (thawed), Luke with his light saber ((r2-d2 launching the saber from the barge was good) and Han Solo helping his buddy Lando who was about to be entean by the sand monster, by firing his gun even though han was still blind. Oh and Im saving this for last...Princess Leia in a nice metal bikini.
B0006B29WA|4.0|In a similar vein with The Killers, Interpol, Snow Patrol and others, Franz Ferdinand isn't very original, but that doesn't make them any less fun. I have a 40 minute commute each way to work and this makes it into my car rotation a few times every week. Well worth the money.
B00005JL7Q|5.0|What's not to love about this movie?  The \\"boy\\" at the center of this hilarious, but touching movie, was adorable.  Hugh Grant, who I normally cannot stand, was great as the carefree and careless playboy.  I almost broke down and cried when Will (played by Grant) accompanied Marcus' nervously rendered version of \\"Killing Me Softly\\" on guitar before a hostile audience of teenagers.   <br /> <br />This film is an instant classic - it has a little of everything - romance, comedy, drama.  Very touching story about a series of lonely people meeting and accepting each other.  It's also about transformation.  By the end of the movie, Will has changed from a cad to a caring and compassionate adult. <br /> <br />Wonderful movie - one of the best! <br /> <br />
B00082IJ08|5.0|I could write some stupid review saying that this is good for this reason or that, but who cares?  What I will tell you is this: music is my life; I own over 2,000 albums, and \\"Demon Days\\" has been the only record in 2005 to consistently grow on me, and never leave the CD stacker in my car.  That's my story, you buy it and be the judge.
B00000IQC8|1.0|I stopped watching this movie when Silent Bob and his side kick came on.  Too much cursing for me.  I'm sorry I wasted my money.
B000050HTO|5.0|Was really worth it. I always like Bob Dylan's older stuff and was glad that I found it on cd. Amazon.com has great selection of music and the web site is easy to use. They always confirm your order and it ships on time.
B0007DAZW8|3.0|I would rather have just purchased 3 songs from this CD. The others get on my nerves.
B00005JKZ3|3.0|This always puzzles me. When a great movie comes out and plays at every state within a large scale of cities.  Movies usually are good and do so well at the box office then, BANG!! A sequel is in the works.  Most cases the sequel will not live up to par with the first big hit.  This sequel isn't great at all.  Ok, the dog is back and yes he is funny.  Wil & Tommy Lee are also back, and this time they aren't as funny as before.  More Aliens are living here on earth so who cares?  I know I don't,  Foul language is in the script and the dialogue is so lame it makes the first outing a big hit even more.  Don't waste time here.  The Director didn't. So why should you!  A bore to say the least.
B0000013GT|5.0|All I can say is this one of my favorite cds of all time and I own over three hundred. This is bob your head, smile wide, jump up and down, chill out music. I don't skip any tracks on the album but my favorite songs that I keep on repeat are Two Dope Boys, and Elevators. Many people are put off by the new poppy Outkast but people that love old school classics are sure to feel this.
B00028HBKM|5.0|What happened before Jesus' 12 hours of life ended here on earth.  All of the interesting answers and what the bible tells is here.  This is acurate, and controversial all at the same time.  Cazivel's acting ability of how Jesus was here on earth. My favorite actor in the great DVD is the actor who portrays Pilate.  Thast actor is a great actor.  Enjoy this great rather graphic and intelligent film.  I know I do, because I own it.
B00003CXCT|4.0|i like george lucas very much.  he make best sci fition movies.  star wars and empire are the best one.
B0001BS4Q0|4.0|In her sophomore effort Sia's songwriting and overall touch with the songs is more refined than her debut.  As an album Colour The Small One is not cohesive.  It starts off exceptionally well, but the strength of the tracks trails off at the end.  Thus, as a whole unit, I would have to give the album three and one-half stars.  Yet there are some standout singles that help the album to rise above its weaknesses.  As many other reviewers have noted \\"Breathe Me\\" will take you in with its sweet expression of pain.  \\"Don't Bring Me Down\\" and \\"Sweet Potato\\" are other gems.  Most of the quality tracks include meditations on sadness, and from reading Sia's vaguely allusive entries on her website it seems to me that events transpiring in her life between 2000's Healing Is Difficult and this album contributed to that feel.  With that in mind, I would say that Sia is best when she writes what she knows and has felt.  You will feel it too when you listen, provided that you want to be brought low emotionally.  It is a fine album for those sad times in your life, but offers redemption as well.
B0006284JQ|4.0|This is the ultimate collection, the only thing a Britney fan needs (along with the Greatest Hits dvd). It contains some of her earlier hits (...'Baby One more Time', 'Stronger', etc.), her more recent hits ('My Prerogative' being released for the first time and also 'Toxic', 'Me Against the Music' with Madonna, etc.) and two new songs including Do Somethin'. I would consider every song on the album a hit single. However, I wish that 'Someday', her newest single, had been recorded in time to be in the collection. Overall, a great collection of hit pop songs you'll enjoy!
B000005GYI|5.0|It is amazing that so much of the songs in this CD, made very early in Milton Nascimento's career, would become classics. Pretty much all of the songs were later recorded by other artists, sometimes with enormous success (\\"Trem Azul\\" with Elis Regina, for example).   <br /> <br />This is one of those wonderful and rare cases in which a group of artists created and refined their creations for quite some time, then released a quality-packed album with no \\"space filling\\" materials. <br /> <br />The arrangements are a bit dated in some cases, and I would have preferred that Milton sang all the songs (some are sung by Lo Borges), but these are minor qualms. An excellent album all around
B000059QYB|4.0|This is the Ultimate Billy Idol Collection! From the early Gen X hit 'Dancing With Myself' (One of my personal favorites) to his biggest hits 'Mony Mony', 'White Wedding', 'Rock the Cradle', and of course 'Rebel Yell'. There is also a live version of 'Rebel Yell' and his remake of Simple Minds' 'Don't You Forget About Me'. The music is all really great, the album is worth buying. If you are going to buy any Billy Idol album, let it be this one!
B00005JNJT|5.0|Probably the best of the five modern movies made about batman, this one is the most true to the comics and the most realistic.  It may be long, but most will enjoy every minute.  If another film is made in the series, I hope they use some of batman's best villians in this style instead of that lame Joel Schumacher style from \\"Batman Forever\\" and \\"Batman and Robin\\". <br />Again, incredible movie, outstanding story if I could give it more stars I would.
0446677450|5.0|This is an excellent book to read if you have never read anything about accumulating wealth/making money or been rich. This book was recommended to me by my father. It is true that the rich kids have different outlook than the poor kids. This is an excellent book which gives you an overall picture of money making. This book DOES NOT teach any specific method of making money. Only gives the underlying principles. It was hard for me to put this book down after I started reading. I became a fan of Kiyosaki and started buying several of his books and CDs only to find that all the rest are regurgitated versions of the same principles. He is trying to make money! However, this book in the series is very very interesting and is also an easy read. I highly recommend people especially people who are just out of school and are trying to increase their wealth.
B00000I41G|5.0|As a fairly recent convert to the world of jazz with an emphasis on Saxophone legends such as Stan Getz, Sonny Rollins, Dexter Gordon, Art Pepper, Hank Mobley, Lester Young, Gene Ammons etc, I was keen to acquire a jazz record of my other favourite instrument - the Guitar. Fortunately I stumbled upon Midnight Blue by Kennt Burrell. This is a brilliant album from start to finish. This music has inspired me to search for more guitar music. I have been advised that Grant Green is also exceptional.
B0001GOH6Q|5.0|This is a most rewarding movie. Every parent and child should watch this movie together.
B00080ZG10|4.0|This movie portrays a hard charging (and complex)entrepreneur who helped write American History during a very turbulent time for this country. I feel it's important for Americans to understand what helped to get us to where we are today as a country. Many of the elements that I loved about Seabiscuit (and made Seabiscuit a great movie (5 Stars in my book)are present in this movie.  <br /> <br />Don't miss it!!
0792844882|5.0|I grew up watching Miss Berkeley on Saved By The Bell. Now all can think about is that muff.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I will keep this short and sweet. Many others will have illustrated the finer points of my review, already. <br />In my estimation, here are the best Sci-Fi shows ever (in chronological order): <br /> <br />Dr. Who <br />The original Star Trek <br />Babylon 5 <br />Farscape <br />Firefly <br /> <br />Why, are they the best? They have captured the elusive \\"cool factor\\" which most television shows and movies have not. <br /> <br />Now, just what exactly is it that makes a show cool in this way? Funny enough, it's the scriptwriting, the imagination of the writers, the actor's characterizations, and how each of these will resonate with the audience. Not a small task by any means. Indeed, it is the most difficult of all things to achieve successfully in film and television. This is why Hollywood regularly has gigantic flops on their hands despite the wads of cash which may have been sunk into their projects. As a matter of fact, I tend to mistrust any big budget film unless it has some writing/directing/acting credentials I know I can trust to give me a relatively believable show. This is not to say that Sci-fi/fantasy is necessarily believable. There must be a truth of our common experience or \\"inner life\\" in a production if it's going to reach an audience. The two aforementioned genres of SciFi/Fantasy are terrific vehicles for this experience as they take us outside of ourselves, and can portray effective metaphor of the Human condition without our prejudices interfering with the message. Nobody wants to be preached to about their political support of X, Y, or Z, but show a similar situation set in a far off mystical land, or on another planet with ficticious characters and history, and it's much easier to examine without taking offense. I know I'm digressing here, but cool factor isn't just \\"wicked awsome\\" for the lowbrow crowd. There's much to be absorbed from a well played fantasy. <br /> <br />If you have that solid a core to your show, then you may already have asuccess on your hands. Look at Dr. Who, and Star Trek as teriffic examples of low budget/high quality. But when you can combine terrific special effects production values with it the way Joss Whedon has in Firefly, then you have a rare combination, indeed. <br /> <br />On the surface, an Old Western Frontier setting with spaceships and vestiges of Mandarin interspersed with English as indicator of the historical/political landscape may be jarring and unusual at first. But watch a few episodes and you won't look back. You'll appreciate it's brilliance and wonder why more shows don't think outside the box the way Firefly does. <br />'Nuff said
0805047905|5.0|It is great for children of any age, but very young children will particularly enjoy the animals and colors in this book.

B00004DTLJ|4.0|Not so popular as \\"Eagle Has Landed\\" or \\"Denim And Leather\\" but shows Saxon in good condition too. \\"Innocence...\\" sounds more monumental then earlier productions, but it's still the same music full of good guitar riffs and few pretty good melodies like \\"Broken Heroes\\" R&R Gypsy
1592400876|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading this hugely popular book, but I was extremely disappointed by it. Actual punctuation rules are few and far between, and there are so many exceptions and alternatives listed that one may conclude that most punctuation is totally variable. The book reads like a stream-of-consciousness rant, particularly the chapter on apostrophes. (Truss, by the way, would argue that \\"apostrophes\\" requires an apostrophe, despite the fact that it's merely a plural.) <br /> <br />The book is heavily padded. It includes Acknowledgements, a Forward, a Publisher's Note, a Preface, and an Introduction. I was particularly annoyed to find that two anecdotes from the Preface were repeated in the Introduction. The final summation chapter is a rambling and meandering mess. <br /> <br />There are two unfortunate errors of note. In the chapter on colons, Truss uses the phrase \\"To err is human: to forgive divine\\" without mentioning that a comma is required after \\"forgive.\\" And there is a blurb on the back cover from James Lipton, identified as the host of \\"Inside the Actors Studio.\\" Nowhere in the text does Truss point out this show's sadly missing apostrophe.
B00005QVHA|5.0|Out of my three Stooges albums, the original CD of Raw Power got played the least. Everything on it sounded dead and flat - no bass, reverbed to hell, guitars buried. Now we have Iggy's remix, which now completely supercedes the original CD issue. And despite what others think, I'm fine with that.<br /><br />This CD rocks in the hardest way. I have played this so often since I bought it, it has hardly left my car. \\"Search and Destroy\\" (the most mangled Bowie mix track) has benefitted most from the remix. The guitars roar with this buzzsaw distortion that initially might be off-putting, but you will grow to like quickly. Some might complain about the added distortion, but I think it makes the track better. At one point in the song (2:31), James Williamson just slams the riff INTO THE FLOOR. Far more intense than the original. I think it is one song that could genuinely blow your speakers if you played it loud enough. Not to mention possibly rendering you infertile and deaf...<br /><br />Iggy's vocals sound much fuller now. The drums don't sound flat on \\"Penetration\\" anymore. And \\"You're Pretty Face...\\" just KILLS now. \\"Gimmie Danger\\" has been given a much fuller band sound,  which it has always needed.<br /><br />Some might criticize Iggy for the mix and revere the original, but I won't. I've heard the original mix on vinyl is supposed to sound better than the original CD, but I don't know. And whatever you do, stay away from the CD called \\"Rough Power\\". It is crap of the highest order.
0553565915|3.0|The author's story is very detailed, and gives the reader a lot of hope and understanding of life after death. But I did run into a few things I didn't quite understand about the book and the author's experiences.<br /><br />1. The author claims the Being of Light was Jesus Christ: \\"There was no questioning who he was. I knew that he was my Savior, and friend, and God.\\" She continues to talk about Jesus as God, Lord, and Savior. Then later in the book she apparently learns that Jesus is not really God... \\"I understood, to my surprise, that Jesus was a separate being from God, with his own divine purpose, and I knew that God was our mutual father. My Protestant upbringing had taught me that God the Father and Jesus Christ were one being.\\" But even after she learns this, she continues to talk about Jesus being her \\"Savior\\" and \\"Lord.\\"<br /><br />2. She claims that there is no one religion that is right or wrong, every religion is right for the person that believes in it. We are all at different levels of spiritual growth. She then later talks about Satan, which suggests that there is a Hell that we will go to if we are not \\"saved\\" by Jesus Christ. But how does anyone go to Hell if there are no wrong religions? How does anyone go to Hell when Jesus Christ is not really God?<br /><br />Other than those and a few other instances, it was a very interesting book.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|This is one of the most talented bands that has came out in a long time. I loved Sounding The Seventh Trumpet and WTF but even without the screaming I think this is their best yet. I'm glad they cut the screaming and will no longer be lumped in with many of the far less talented screamo bands. I think bands need to evolve and change their sound as they progress. Who wants to listen to songs that all sound alike over and over. Sadly many bands out right now lack the talent to change their sound. The guitar work is absolutely amazing. I just can't say enough good things about this band.
B00000AFGM|5.0|Yes. But not better than his others.  Equally as good as all of them. They are all the best albums ever created. The man and the band couldnt make garbage if they tried.
B0007YMUZW|5.0|'The Man We Call Ryan Adams' has an amazing output of beautiful songs that tingle your spine. For me the instant mark of quality. This reminds me a bit of Elvis Costello's best years of songwriting: a ongoing, incredible lot of excellent musical jewels, created in a relatively short period of his career.  <br />Long live Ryan's creative flow! 'Cold Roses' grows on you, give it time. It gets better and better everyday and anyone who liked 'Heartbreaker' or 'Love is Hell' pts. 1 & 2 should buy his latest effort at once and be amazed by numbers like 'When Will You Come Back Home', 'Mockingbird', 'How Do You Keep Love Alive', 'Let It Ride' and 'Cold Roses'. This man and his band are very beneficial for your health. Godspeed Ryan & His Cardinals!

B0002IQNAG|5.0|If you are a zombie movie fan, this is the one to buy. 3 different versions of DOTD, with loads of extras on each disc. <br /> <br />The set is handsomely packaged, and the quality of the transfer is outstanding--if anything, it looks better on these DVDs than it did when I saw it originally in the cinema. <br /> <br />Though 45 dollars is a lot of money to spend, I didn't regret this purchase at all, and am grateful to Anchor Bay for releasing it. <br /> <br />A definite must have for any serious zombie movie collector!
B000A88F22|1.0|It's a waste of space to even describe how horrific it is.  These favorable reviews are the result of the hollywood propaganda machine.  I would rather have my eyes superglued open while watching back to back showings of Kevin Costner's \\"The Postman.\\"
B0009UC7QQ|5.0|I guess this is one of those movies you'll either love or hate, and it's not because of Jim Carrey in either case.  I loved it, my mother hated it.  It's like a twilight zone episode with a lot of flare and humor.  It works on different levels, depending on how you want to take it.<br /><br />As a comedy, it's not one of Carrey's funniest, but consistenly amusing, with a bit of dark humor, some even morbid.  However, there's enough of an upbeat tone throughout, chiefly due to the music and Carrey's mere presence, to keep it from being classed a dark comedy.  If you want you can read more into it, perhaps an allegory for the shells we build around ourselves, symbolism for phoniness in general, or something like that.<br /><br />If you know the premise, it kind of spoils the surprise and the intrigue of learning what's going on along with the main character, Truman (Carrey).  So I won't go into the basic premise here, in case you haven't seen it or heard about it.  Instead, basically here's what you'll learn in the first part of the movie:<br /><br />Truman lives with his wife in an ideal, suburban-like island community.  Truman's never left the island, his occasional attempts repressed.<br /><br />From Truman's point of view, strange things are happening, usually with pat explanations that comes a bit too late to ring true:<br /><br />The reappearance of his father, presumed dead; an elevator door that leads from a swank lobby to an unfinished room full of surprised looking loafers; voices on the car radio discussing his own whereabouts and movements; etc.  It becomes enough to make Truman paranoid, and to believe everyone is in on some kind of set-up at his expense, even his wife.  You'll see more than Truman does, evidence that he really is being spied on - by this time in the movie you'll probably know exactly what's going on, but the fun is in seeing Truman, initially baffled by the clues, gradually figure it out.<br /><br />One of the more imaginative sequences involves Truman gradually creating a picture of a girl he met in high school and never saw again.  He tears out different pieces of magazine pictures of women's faces, and pieces them together like a puzzle.  This is symbolic of his gradual discovery of what's really happening to him.<br /><br />If you don't like The Truman Show, I imagine it's because the premise doesn't seem to be plausibly presented. To me, that's part of the comedy.  It's also helped along by an outstanding performance by Ed Harris (The Right Stuff, Milk Money, Enemy at the Gates) as Christof, the guy behind it all.tive sequences involves Truman gradually creating a picture of a girl he met in high school and never saw again.

0316096199|5.0|I first read \\"The Lovely Bones\\" & loved it! I grabbed \\"Lucky\\" the second it came out, not even realizing that this was non-fiction, part of the author's life story. <br />Sebold was brutally attacked & raped in college. I cannot imagine someone reading this book & giving it less then 5 stars. This happened to her!! How dare someone criticize her responses to it. I applaud every inch of this book. She bravely describes minute details of her horrifying ordeal & the long, sorrowful aftermath. What a lesson we learn from her bravery. She didn't let the attack cripple her. She rose above it & became stronger because of it! She is a remarkable person & after having read this, I have the utmost respect for her as a woman.
B00005JN0T|5.0|Those scenes with Will Smith getting outta bed and taking a shower really had me thinking..... Jada is one fortunate sista!! For the few times that I actually watch the movie past the first 7 minutes, I think it is pretty cool.  <br /> <br />Don't you just love Sonny too???!!!
0805076476|5.0|Chuck Palahniuk is a genius.   <br /> <br />Like most people, I saw the movie and the movie led me to the book.  The book led me to Chuck's other books.  The other books led me to this conclusion:  Palahniuk is without equal.   <br /> <br />This book will cause you to question consumerism and our devotion to material things just as much as the movie.  Are we really doing something meaningful with our lives???? <br />

B0000A02TZ|5.0|I've seen several of National Lampoon's great comedy films, but nothing tops \\"Animal House\\", which I find a great classic. A spoof on college life in the fraternity system. First, there are the neat and orderly Omegas and next door are the wild and trashy Deltas who want nothing better than to throw all kinds of parties, especially a toga party. I've seen this film several times on the big screen since I didn't get enough of the humor just by seeing it only once. There were many parts I missed out that I caught later. <br /> <br />John Belushi was the icing on the cake starring as John \\"Bluto\\" Blutarsky. His expressions - especially with his eyebrows - was more than enough to make anyone laugh. The cafeteria scene was probably the best, ending with the food fight. Other great scenes was Eric \\"Otter\\" Stratton (Tim Matheson) with his womanizing and his fling with Dean Wormer's wife, Donald \\"Boon\\" Schoenstein (Peter Reigert) being a big fan of Otis Day and the Knights, Larry \\"Pinto\\" Kroger (Tom Hulce) fooling around with the mayor's daughter and Kent \\"Flounder\\" Dorfman (Stephen Furst) throwing up on Dean Wormer (John Vernon). Then there is Daniel Simpson \\"D-Day\\" Day (Bruce McGill) who creates the \\"Death Mobile\\" out of Flounder's brother's Lincoln Continental complete with the head of Emil Faber - the founder of Faber College - cut off from his statue. No movie could be complete without Donald Sutherland as Professor Dave Jennings who teaches a lecture on \\"Paradise Lost\\" by John Milton which he admitted he found boring as did his students. <br /> <br />The Widescreen Double Secret Probation Edition DVD was probably the best investment I've ever made, which includes a menu with the Delta alumni, where are they now, and behind the making of \\"Animal House\\". Interestingly enough, Dean Wormer's office was actually filmed inside the dean's office at Oregon State University and they actually filmed it with the horse inside brought in by Bluto, D-Day and Flounder. Several othercolleges and universities were considered as filming locations, but only Oregon State University granted permission. When the cast and crew arrived, they found it quite an experience. Some of the cast even visited a frat house, facing some unpleasant moments that led to a hasty departure. <br /> <br />This is a great classic, especially for avid John Belushi fans who had known him since the premiere of \\"Saturday Night Live\\".
B00028HBKM|1.0|This movie is not accurate at all.  If you really want to study and know the truth about the passion of the Christ may I suggest that you take a few courses in Christology at your local theology schools.  Please don't be fooled by this mockery of a film.  If you really want to know about the teachings of Christ and  to emulate him, then I might suggest that you study his philosophies along with the readings of the Buddha, and many, many other philosophers and spiritual teachers.  This movie is total Hollywood bogus
B00003CXCW|5.0|This is an incredible classic that must be seen by everyone who really appreciates the taste of of the golden era of Cinema. <br />I really didn't expected much of it, but as a result, it turn out to be one of my favorite movies!!!  <br /> <br />I must remember you that this movie was selected by the American Film Institute as the N 12 of the 100 best of all time. <br /> <br />Great performances and witty dialogs! <br />A MUST SEEN CLASSIC
0316168815|2.0|I struggled through this book because my daughter wanted me to read it.  I would have saved the effort after the first 50 pages if I had not been trying to spare my daughter's feelings.<br /><br />Boring...a waste of time and brain cells.
0451169514|5.0|'It' is one of the best novels I've ever read. It's my favorite Stephen King book (just ahead of \\"The Waste Lands\\" and \\"The Stand: Complete and Uncut\\"). It's the one work of King's that I come back to read again and again over the years. <br /> <br />First of all - realize going in that this is a LONG book. It's 1000+ pages. That's a good thing. Unless you have the attention span of a 3-year old, why wouldn't you want a good book to be as long as possible. Pace yourself, take a few days, and enjoy. <br /> <br />Secondly - realize going in that this is a COSMIC book. The story does not revolve around a clown. It's not a tale of a smalltown demon or local monster. It (the creature) is a cosmic being. Before the end of the book, you're going to be reading about macroverses, about the Creator, about other dimensions, etc. If you don't like that stuff, go read something else (I love the cosmic stuff, and I'm glad It - the monster - has the nature it does). <br /> <br />Thirdly - realize that, although this isn't as out-and-out horrifying a tale as, say, Pet Sematary, this is King's most DISTURBING book. Things happen, things that you'd rather not read about. Some of these things are murders, mutilations, and other bloodletting. Other things are sexual. Again, if you can't handle that, read something else. <br /> <br />There, I think that takes care of 95% of the whiners and complainers who have posted negative reviews, saying either: <br /> <br />#1 - The book is too long. <br />#2 - It's too cosmic at the end. <br />#3 - Stuff happened I wasn't comfortable with. <br /> <br />(I guess those people wanted a short book, about a psychotic small-town clown, in which nothing happens that the reader finds objectionable. Maybe King will write a book like that someday). <br /> <br />For everyone else, this book is fantastic. Sure, King has a few annoying writing habits (the endless \\"beep-beeps\\", kids referring to other kids by their first AND LAST names), but here the characterspractically leap off the page for you. You'll crawl under the porch at 29 Neibolt Street with them. You'll play in the Barrens. You'll get beat up by Henry Bowers. You'll go down under the city, where It lives. <br /> <br />And, if you're like me, you'll do it all over again many times! <br /> <br />p.s. The refrigerator parasites scene makes my skin crawl.
B0002EXH5O|5.0|Whether or not Megadeth is just an offshoot or Metallica is up to the fans to decide. As you most likely know, Dave Mustaine (vocalist, rhythm guitarist and main writer for megadeth) was kicked out of Metallica in 1983 for drug abuse. That same year he formed his own little band of jazz-thrash-metal (along with jazz guitarist Chris Poland) and released the album Killing Is My Business... And Business is Good! in 1985. Aggressive, fast paced, intelligent, and at times simply silly, it showed the perfect combination of Jazz and Thrash metal. Metallica obviously kicked themselves for letting Mustaine go, and if they did not feel that way upon hearing the opening track, they must have upon hearing Mechanix, Mustaine's original version of Metallica's Four Horsemen. Twice as fast, twice as skilled and twice as coherent, it was Mustaine's way of lashing back at Metallica for them continuing to play his songs after he left, which they had the nerve to continue doing in their timeless classic Ride The Lightning. Fast forward 5 years and you see megadeth with a new lineup, with expert guitarist Marty Friedman. If Peace Sells was a great album due to its anti-social themes, politically minded lyrics and guitar interplay (all of which Rust In Peace possesses by the way), Rust In Peace improved the guitar solo even further. Name me another band where the Rhythm Guitarist and Lead Guitarist are almost equals (AND manage to pull it off without sucking) and their master work would still not compete with Rust In Peace. Granted some bands may have one guitarist capable of ripping these awesome solos. But can you name one with two? Metallica you say? I don't think so. While Friedman Mustaine and Hammet are all at about the same level, Hetfeild can hardly compete with Kurt Cobain, let alone Mustaine (admittedly the weakest of the aforementioned guitarists). Now I do tend to ramble, so let me just give a quick breakdown of the tracks and how I rate them.<br /><br />1. Holy Wars... The Punishment Due- From the opening solo, you can tell that you are listening to the work of a great guitarist(s). Lyrics continue Peace Sells's political agenda. And then go into a different song about superheroes. Brilliant! 10/10<br /><br />2. Hangar 18- James Bond-ish opening. Based On Call of Ktulu. Possibly the most famous track from this album. Goes into conspiracy theory about aliens and stuff. The ending solo has a little duel going on between Mustaine and Friedman (i.e. one plays a small crazy sub-solo, drum interlude and them the other plays and it continues like that for a while) the most technically accomplished solo on this album (or possibly ever)by far. 11/10<br /><br />3. Take No Prisoners- More political stuff. I think you can tell by the title as you did in Holy Wars. Solo was not that much of a standout (especially after Hangar 18) but still good. The best part is the ending chant. 9/10<br /><br />4. Five Magics- This is the \\"Dungeons and Dragons\\" song on this album. Cool opening and tis almost as moody as KIMB's Looking Down The Cross. Cool lyrics and good guitar work. But not as good as the opening two tracks. Still, its almost epic. 10/10<br /><br />5. Poison Was The Cure - Another cool opening. This one is more of a jumble of words with a nifty little solo. I can swear i heard \\"Set Fire To Metallica\\" somewhere in the track. Not very long but adds mood to the album. Would be a 9 if it was longer and had a longer solo. 8/10<br /><br />6. Lucretia- Good grove to the track. Cool lyrics and vocal performance by mustaine. Guitar work was not very standout on this one though. But it does add a bit of a groovy feel to the album. Not the best track but still awesome. 8/10<br /><br />7. Tornado Of Souls- This is my personal favorite track from the album. I love the lyrics and guitar work. But the part that does it for me is the crazy solo. It is one of the most underappreciated solos i have ever heard. It sounds almost like the Hotel California solo. Whileit is not as complex muscially as Hangar 18, it sounds much cooler since it is slower and you can actually hear each separate note. Killer Track. I can listen to it for hours 12/10.<br /><br />8. Dawn Patrol- Just a bassline with Mustaine rapping about the environment in a fake british accent. Metallica stole the baseline in its \\"God That Failed\\". Not the best track, but it doesnt last too long fortunately. Seems more like a prelude to the end track. 7/10<br /><br />9. Rust In Peace... Polaris- Lots of good vocal work. Lyrically, this is my favorite track. They even have vic doing the deep voice which is really cool. it has a bit of a feel like the \\"Bohemian Rhapsody\\" operatic part, except with much less clean vocals. Good guitar work though no standout solo. But the lyrics and vocal performance of mustaine save it from extinction. Killer Track. Ends too fast. Awesome end chant. 10/10<br /><br />In Short. Kill 'em All Popularized Thrash. Peace Sells Revolutionized Thash. Rust In Peace Perfected Thrash.ia solo.

B000002GOZ|5.0|I've been his fan for more than twenty years. After I went to his concert, I bought this album because his concert was excellent and perfect.  His live sound was even better than his CD.  This CD nearly inspires his concert.  If you were his fan, you must buy this one.  Never disappointed.
B0000DI7UR|3.0|I was just introduced to Stratovarius not long ago from a friend. My friend showed me the song I'm Still Alive. I thought it was ok, and decided to investigate Stratovarius a little more. I then heard Speed of Light, and I also thought that song was ok. So I decided to buy my first Strato album. I headed down to the store, and only found elements pt 2, so I said \\"what the heck\\" and gave it a try. This is a mediocre album at best. It has some enjoyable tracks such as the album opener, I Walk to my Own Song, and I'm Still Alive. However, this album is just boring for the most part. This band has so much potential. Kotipelto can sing pretty good when he is in key, and Tolki is a good guitarist, but the songwriting is not good. This album is full of dumb lyrics. \\"Mr Mean you don't know Beans\\"-enough said. Don't get me wrong, this is an enjoyable album, but it isn't anything special. I rate this album 2.5 stars, but I'll use my rounding skills that I learned in 3rd grade and give it a 3.
B00006JL1Z|5.0|You can listen to their great music, sounds, personalities, and the history for more than twenty years.  I love \\"Seven Wonders\\", \\"Everywhere\\", \\"Little Lies\\", and \\"Skies the Limit\\".

B00005Q4CS|5.0|After seeing this movie, you will feel like you've just taken a guided tour through hell and back. You will feel shocked. You will feel horrified. And you will feel so lucky not to be where the 4 characters are at the end. <br /> <br />Set among the beaches of Coney Island, this movie follows four basically good people with dreams and shows how they try to achieve (and fail) at their dreams through drugs. In the beginning, Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto) and Tyrone (Marlon Waynes) are dealing, wanting to get a pound of pure heroin and retiring rich. Harry's beautiful girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly) wants to open up a clothing store and not depend on her parents anymore. And Harry's mother Sara (Ellen Burstyn) spends her days in front of the TV until she gets a call to be on TV, and she is ecstatic. Dreaming to fit into her favorite red dress, she tries a diet. When that doesn't work, she goes on diet pills. In the first of three parts, these four people are at their height-Marion and Harry are young, in love and on heroin, Tyrone and Harry's business is booming, and Sara finds that her dream of being on TV is a reason to be happy. They are at the top of the wooden roller coaster, and there is no where to go but down.  <br /> <br />And oh boy, does it go down.  <br /> <br />As summer ends, the fall comes (quite literally) for these people-whenever something good is supposed to happen, something bad happens instead. Tyrone and Harry's business is dried up and are low on cash, forcing Marion to go to extremes to get money for their score. And meanwhile Sara has been eating nothing but coffee and diet pills. When she gets adjusted she thinks that something is wrong, so she takes more-lots more, and she mentally spirals downward (in one hallucination she is being attacked by her fridge). When these people finally hit rock bottom, it is devestating-all of them land in places worse than death physically, mentally and psychologically.  <br /> <br />Everything about this movie is fresh, excellent and razar-sharp. Darren Aronofsky is a young indie director with one other film to his name (Pi), and I know that we all will be seeing more of him over the years-he is too brilliant to disappear. The editing is both exaggerated and realistic-the way that they made the drug hallucinations is simply brilliant, and isn't afraid to push the envelope to the extreme. The soundtrack is cutting-edge by the Kronos String Quartet with mixing by Clint Mansell and absolutly PERFECT for the movie-you will not be able to hear the crickets chirp without thinking of the beats to the movie. It's so incredibly haunting.  <br /> <br />And then there's the acting. Jared Leto manages to impress us and make us forgive him for years of B-movies with his sympathetic performance. In the scene talking to his mother, you can see that he is genuinly scared for his mother when he discovers that she is on diet pills, being a druggie himself. He is basically a good person but doesn't have the power to truly help them. Marlon Waynes is so good in his guilt-ridden performance that for 2 hours you can honestly forget that this is the guy from 'White Chicks' and 'Scary Movie.' Jennifer Connelly is obviously a great actress, but here she demonstrates what makes her a phenomenal actress. Her change from loving Harry with heroin on the side to loving heroin with Harry on the side is truly brilliant. And then there's Ellen Burstyn. She is so brilliant and convincing not just in her drug-induced hysteria but also in her more quiet scenes. I am appalled that she didn't win a Best Actress Oscar over Julia Roberts for her little half performance in Erin Brockovich-a prime example of star power overpowering a great performance. Sure, Julia might have given the best performance (which isn't saying much) in her pathetic romantic comedy-ridden career, but Ellen Burstyn gave the best performance in HER career (after a Best Actress Oscar for Alice Doesn't Live Here Anymore and being partof the horror classic 'The Excorcist', that's saying A LOT). All of these great performances will live with you forever.  <br /> <br />In the fold-out poster that I found inside the DVD, the director says that this movie is the triumph of Addiction over the human spirit, and he couldn't be more right. In the beginning, these people have dreams and seem so close to achieving them. But by the end because of the abuse of drugs their reality is so awful that their dreams become their escape, especially to forget what they did to get the drugs in the first place, and it becomes a circle. Though this is ovbiously an anti-drug movie, it doesn't have a preachy feeling to it. It's as though Darren Aronofsky was simply more interested in how Addiction triumphs and showing Addiction as the hero, not the enemy. I also applaud the movie for not only showing illegal drugs as bad but also innocent legal drugs and how they can be awful for you if used wrongly and eaten like M&Ms. This is a movie that can possibly make a life change for some people-EVERY PERSON SHOULD SEE THIS MOVIE-You will learn more from a dramatization about drugs than any documentary, because this shows and gets deep inside the heads of everyday people and their fall from grace. Undebiably one of the best films of the decade, possibly ever made.
B000268QB2|5.0|This is such an amazing album. Hopes and Fears is one of my favorate albums besides for Hot Fuss, from The Killers. Keane is such an amazing band, something the US could use for a change from all of this hiphop nonsense. I am 16 years old and Keane is my favorate band. Most people think Im crazy until the listen to atlest one song off of Hopes and Fears whether it be Sunshine, or Your Eyes Open. The critics really need to stop comparing Keane to Coldplay. Coldplay is horrible because the singer's voice is like nails on a chalkboard and he looks like a rat. Tom Chaplin's vox however are so rich and stunning. Keane may not be the biggest band in the US, but they are well on thier way.
B0000TB014|5.0|I am a 18 year old teenager, and just graduated highschool. I have loved Michael Jackson since I was a kid and watching him on MTV, and dancing just like him, lol. I love this DVD because it has my favorite songs on here, and it was a good deja vu from when I was a kid. It is a simple layout, and the songs come in a great order. From oldest to newest. If you are like the guy below, and just care about DVDs which offer special offers, and syuch, then this is not for you. Because if you are a M.J. fan then all you should be caring about are the songs, and that's all that is on here. If you at some point like his music, or still like it, I recommend this dvd.
B0009VRHLK|5.0|Oh no! People don't understand this film and they hate it. <br /> <br />\\"The Brown Bunny\\" is obviously not for everyone. It breaks the conventions of storytelling even by art house standards. But that does not make it a bad film; in fact I think it was a great film. Most of the complaints I've read on this film revolve around Gallo's inabilities to provide us with information about anything, especially about the main character Bud. This film is not about spoon feeding information to the viewer but rather, the viewer extracting information about Bud that is deliberately not provided to us by Gallo. It's not about what we see on screen but what we piece together about Bud's tormented life. This film interestingly enough solicits our attention and imagination as active film viewers rather than passive film viewers. <br /> <br />Ultimately, \\"The Brown Bunny\\" is about hanging on to imaginary things that do not exist. It is a metaphor about living in a make believe world rather than the \\"real world.\\" <br />If you can put aside logic and plausibility for summer films then you can be patient and appreciate this film for what it is. But, if you're looking for a film with a regurgitated story line and spoon fed plot points then this film is obviously not for you. <br />
B0002S94OS|4.0|I've heard this message over and over and over (it usually stops when the band gets rich). <br />I'm so sick of the \\"I hate my government\\" crap, want to be brave? Move to China and attempt to get away with that routine, -then- I'll be impressed.  <br />The anti-government style of whining belongs in hippy or punk music (which in turn belong in the garbage), NOT metal.   <br />NOTE: The MUSIC on this album is just brutal though, and well worth the purchase of the CD.  Too bad about the lyrics.
0060922583|4.0|Talbot brings us a great compilation of information from many fields including physics (Bohm's holographic theory of physics and its related implications), psychological theory of mind to psychic phenomena. <br /> <br />I offer four stars rather than five due to his uneven evaluation of the information he's surveyed. He seems to be hiding a prejudicial view of reincarnation, while lending credibility to other phenomena which carry only heresay validity, such as Saints walking through a firey furnace. <br /> <br />But without his efforts in this book I would not have been given as wide a survey of these subjects anywhere else.  Buy the book and ignore his inconsistencies.
B0006284JQ|1.0|This collection of lousy songs should be called as worst songs instead.if this is good then I shudder to think how her bad songs would sound.not one song in this compilation is good.DONT EVER EVER BUY THIS TRASH.Get a great compilation from a band that write and sing their own songs like We sold our souls for rock'n'roll from Black Sabbath instead.ZERO STARS.
B0002KPIQY|5.0|Gia is a true story about America's first supermodel in the 80's. She was a lesbian and the love story is a central and tragic part of the film. Unfortunately, Gia gets involved involved in the drug scene and starts taking cocain to survive the the daily pressures of being a supermodel and wanted by many, many modeling agencies. Eventually she starts using herion and starts injecting it and becomes addicted. Because of this, she is infected by the Aids virus, which people still know very little about in that time period. I think this was Angelina Jolie's best performance to date and she conveys the pathos and the helplessness and the desperation of this woman extremely well, you feel transfixed by her performance and it casts a spell upon you. Gia was always searching for love and not glamor, money or the limelight. Her family broke apart when whe was a girl growing up and her relationship with her mother was polite at best. She was starved for love and affection. Her story is tragic and Ms. Jolie makes you feel for this woman and her tragic life. It's easily one of the best films ever made and one of my favorite movies of all time. I highly recommend it. I would never label it as a gay/lesbian movie because it is worthy of so much more. Her sexuality is only an aspect of her character and is also treated as such. Gia has a very deep and torurted soul. Her story is unique and defies boundaries or stereptypes. I give it a 10 out of 10.
