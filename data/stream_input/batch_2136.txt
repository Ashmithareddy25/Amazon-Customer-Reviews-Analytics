B00280LYIC|5.0|One of the best books I've read in my whole life. Very interesting and positively amazing. I can't wait to read the next book.
B00000420F|5.0|Lovely album that gets better both with repeated listens, and as the disc progresses.  I'm a relatively newbie regarding opera, and this is perfectly accessible, without losing the sheen of authenticity over many listens.  I find it soothes and deepens my mood while sharpening my mind and allowing me to concentrate more fully.  Recommended and appreciated.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book captivated me.  I could not put it down.  Sad but true to life. As a victim I could relate.
B003YUC2FE|5.0|Usually the sequels to original movies aren't so hot.  Not in this case.  Each movie is incredible.  Brings me joy to watch them, over and over. Woody and Buzz.  What a duo!
B007SYWFRM|5.0|This was a gift for my daughter.<br /><br />I would recommend since she seems to be enjoying<br /><br />it.<br /><br />thank, thanks, once again
0471463396|5.0|We hear a lot of people talking about value investing (and quite as many talking about other investing ways). Many of the speakers try to use different and creative ways to \\"fit\\" their own theories and strategies into the value investing box, many misrepresent the basic concepts of value investing reasoning that new times require new tools<br /><br />Value investing is not a new concept. It was defined and taught by Professor Benjamin Graham more than eighty years ago. Professor Graham researched, defined, taught and wrote extensively about methods of valuing companies, deciphering financial statements and finding the companies intrinsic value. However it is 2013 now and many say all this is irrelevant.<br /><br />And then came, Professor Greenwald.<br /><br />In this insightful book Professor Greenwald not only explains the basic concepts and definitions behind Professor Grahams teaching but also takes the reader many steps further. Professor Greenwald explores the way value investing evolved over the years and how the basic concepts were used and modified by Graham disciples to support the present environment without letting past concepts be forgotten.<br /><br />Professor Greenwald very nicely weaves the teaching of Professor Graham and his #1 student, Mr. Warren Buffett, into an elaborate but yet simple to understand book about understanding and applying value investing techniques. He is doing so not by dismissing past lessons but by embracing the past and adapting it to current times.<br /><br />As an added bonus, I found Professor Greenwald several real life examples of valuing companies by using the discussed valuation techniques very useful. I also would like to commend the author for profiling eight successful value investors and highlighting their different methods of applying valuation concepts when researching for suitable investments.<br /><br />Read this book, I know you will appreciate decade's long investment truths, as well as present time applications in your search for finding companies intrinsic value.<br /><br />If you are interested in the media industry, I would recommend Professor Greenwald book \\"The Curse of the Mogul\\" which deciphers the media industry (as a potential investment field). I believe reading it while applying the lessons taught by Professor Greenwald in \\"Value Investing\\" will be very insightful.<br /><br />Amir Avitzur<br />Author of \\"Why do we sell low and buy high? The guide you must read BEFORE you invest\\"
0981951252|5.0|A fan of Success Magazine and I found the book to be amazing. Also orderd the Guide to Best Year and am very pleased with both selections.  Thank you.
B000002B35|1.0|Really missing Roger Waters.  Some good moments w/ Gilmore but its a weak substitute for the real band.  Two more words required
B009UX2YAC|5.0|this game was awesome I loved it you should do more games like this one and more platforming games they are really fun and creative.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I have arthritis in my hands so using my standing case is so much less painful than holding it.  I can just stand it on my lap or knees or pillow and read to my hearts content.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|We selected this book in our book club.  I normally don't read this kind of book but enjoyed it alot.
B00BESLHEA|1.0|First let me say I love King Fu movies, from great to cheesy I love them. I also love Quentin Tarantino and have seen several films from his proteges, but this movie was truly awful.<br /><br />I didn't even make it past 1/2 hour, and ended up watch reruns of Californication.<br /><br />If this movie becomes part of the free catalog, then ok I guess you only loose your time - but don't pay to see this crap.
B0014DBZY2|4.0|It has alot of good fast paste songs like cassius and olympic airways. It sort of failed on the slow end but its not this bands style to give slow and heavy ballads. So if you want to somthing to rock out to Antidotes is for you.
B0031YJFCQ|5.0|Brought the book yo a good ending, going full circle. Very much enjoyed reading all three books. Now yo wait for 2 more American made movies.
B0083IU84Y|4.0|I heard Jake Bugg's single two fingers and bought the album thinking it would mostly be alot of catchy or quirky songs. It had that with two fingers, lightning bolt, and seen it all but it also had much more. It really slows down in the end and has strong heart fealt ballads like slide, broken, and my personal favorite - note to self.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|Looking for a movie, checked the reviews on this movie. Said \\"ok ,good reviews, so I'll check it out. Boy, was I NOT disappointed! Good movie! Laughed my ass off!
B0027MJU00|5.0|I first read Gone Girl: A Novel to see what all the hype was about, after loving that book I knew I needed to read more from Gillian Flynn. Dark Places: A Novel is amazing, it held my interest throughout the entire book, I couldn't put it down and ended up reading it in 2 days. I highly recommend it, the end will surprise you (maybe, it did me!)
0425074811|1.0|...but I can't enter less.<br />I read this in the late '60s or early '70s. It stinks; von Daniken proposes his various hints, innuendos and out-right lies as fact.<br />It's not his fault that idiots world-wide believe him, but like various other charlatans, he is due every bit of disapproval and rejection that logic demands.<br />I'd place him with Depak Chopra and Uri Geller offering absolute disregard for facts with sleazy efforts to profit from lies and deception.<br />At the time, the book probably cost $2, and I'm sorry to have wasted the money; there is nothing of value in his writing.
B007TNS6JI|5.0|At first,I thought this app would be a waste of memeory on my kf, but I was wrong! This is a great app that any hack in's slash fan would like.So far so good.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|i think that this is a great read and i enjoyed this book just as i had with all the other Dan Brown books have before.
0805076557|5.0|Awesome book, really awesome. One if my favorite movies and books of all time, theres a reason its still so popular.
B007UW9VWO|4.0|What's life? What should one pursuit?<br /><br />Especially good for those who are tired of their working life / if you are a sushi lover!
B006PAZMMK|4.0|Definitely worth the few bucks. Im not a huge fan by any means but he has a few tracks I like so I figured id check out the new ep, not bad.
0756990696|4.0|This is a great book for introducing kids to philosophy. As the book mentions, philosophy isn't something we can learn- but we can learn to think philosophically (something lost in chaos of our materialist world). The lessons within are much needed for an era that has lost the value of thinking and learning to ask the right questions. If we can get our kids to be good thinkers, trust me- they'll be successful at whatever endeavors they undertake.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Simple read for those young at heart. Sky and Holder have your typical high school rollercoaster relationship. Through the middle, the story gets slow,but there is a sudden unexpected twist. Sky has a dark, unknown past that she has to open through Holder.
146500632X|5.0|This was bought for a fourteen year old niece for Christmas and she was very happy with it. I think that was a good purchase.
B000YMM3CC|4.0|I loved the movie, but had a problem with the audio using my laptop.  It was a little better on my desktop PC.
0099554569|5.0|It was a wonderful read and i felt like i was reading a version of my unwritten diary. I wish i could read japanese to read the original untranslated version.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This game is so great, it's hard to believe that it is free! Temple run 1 was awesome but somehow they have made an even better game. This has better graphics and more obstacles, which give it more interest than the first game. Also it changes up the course each time you play so it doesn't get boring or predictable. This is a very addicting game, especially with the different objectives. The only thing I had a problem with is that every now and then, the character would jump instead of turn. Otherwise a great game!
B004EPZ07K|5.0|love it
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This is the best science fiction book (and humor) book I've ever read. This could make a movie! Humorous, humble, and very dedicated. All the planning in this book is well-planned. The amazing thing is these plans can help you survive on Mars for over a year! A real page-turner. A real joy for readers who love adventures and science-fiction.
B004LWZW4M|5.0|love it
B008GB2ALW|5.0|When it comes to books for young children (e.g., less than 15 months or so), I don't think you can judge the quality of the book by how much it entertained you, the adult, or how simple or complex you judge the plot, artwork, or dialogue to be. The book is not for you, it is for your child.  All that matters is how engaged your child becomes when you read it to them. Yes, ideally you would like them to enjoy books with some objective educational benefit. However, young children have a very short attention span. Therefore, any book that keeps their attention is better than one that does not.<br /><br />I have found that for my 10-month-old son, some books he really likes and pays attention to without fidgeting, and some books he just wants to flip through the pages and play with the book itself. Most of the time, I don't fully understand what it is about a particular book that he likes or why some books he could care less about. \\"Brown Bear, Brown Bear, What Do you See\\" is one book that he loves. That is all I can say about this book, and it is all that really matters to me.
B004A8ZWW4|5.0|love it
B001FB563E|5.0|Amazing film, well put together, and one fantastic artistic piece. One of Vigo's best performances. You really get drawn into their world, and feel their pain.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|love it
B0051T46XM|5.0|A really cool story bringing some old world folk lore into play and some government based cover ups. A cool film
B00992CF6W|5.0|My friend told me about Minecraft, so I bought it on my phone. I loved it so much, so when it came out for bigger screens, I nearly fainted. I now have Minecraft for my computer, xbox, and kindle fire. Minecraft is an amazing app everyone should have. I give this app a 5 out of 5 review! Minecraft Forever!
B003R0MEZ4|5.0|No need to explain any one who watches this show already know how great it is!  Bought this season at a great price  Thank you
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|well worth the price! Great storyline and awesome graphics! Good mixture of hidden objects and finding clues! Cant wait for the next game!
B000F8O2OM|5.0|great action as always. great actors and story line not to hard to follow. i would recommend this and all other seasons to anyone interested
B004X1WUQ4|5.0|I would recommend this to anyone who likes politics and economics.  I gave it five stars because this is an important book.  This is a must read if you want to understand unemployment, interest rates and international trade policy.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|This book is great for anyone who is over 10 if they can read that well. This book kept me interested. So interested I read this book in 2 days.
B009LT1YZ6|1.0|I was really hoping to like this app but like another reviewer stated, the fish just goes to the side and stays stuck to the side. I cannot move it away. I have many apps that use tilt controls, the accelerometer, etc, and they all function perfectly. Nothing is wrong with my phone but this app is completely unplayable and the tilt controls don't work. I have a Galaxy Nexus, which all android apps should be tested on before release since it is the pure Google Android OS. I noticed the other reviewer with this exact same complaint had a pure Android OS device as well. This appears to be a blatant failure on the part of the dev to not test his app on Google flagship devices, which should be the first line of testing.
B003R4ZMNQ|5.0|I am so thrilled with this DVD package!  I can't wait until Season 3 comes out.  I recommend this DVD series to anyone who loved the original series.
B0011ZNAIC|5.0|love this movie. very cute learning store as well as funny. just love it. jerry seinfeld voice as the main bee is comical.
0785152458|5.0|I bought this comic for my niece and she loves it!  She recommends it to anyone who loved the movie.
B004ODLUGM|5.0|I purchased this for my 3 yr. old grandson to watch. we have the gruffalo's child and we wanted this one.My grandson love it and so did grammy and pop. it was definitly worth the purchase.
0761169431|5.0|Got this for my 9 yr old grandson and he udes it constantly.  He makes some interesting oragami from it.
B00AHSIQWE|1.0|The audio was uninteligible . Nobody could understand the dialogue. I felt that I was robbed. There doesnt seem to be any way to resolve a technical problem.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Its an awesome game. try it you'll love it too. if you like the first one the you'll like the 2 one.
B00914JWSW|5.0|I am a big fan of Barbra Streisand and I love her voice and how she can be heard over the music.
B00846REIS|4.0|It is a must read book just like the 50 shades of Grey. It was one of my many favorite books.
B005LAIHY0|5.0|I was surprised on how it is like the start to the Alien movie's that we all ready have going to watch them all from the start LOL
B008673ZAQ|4.0|I am waiting to read the third book. Wow I enjoy reading all these book. It bring excitement to my marriage and my husband love it too. Lol
B0029O08WA|5.0|I am a Twilight Fan and have seen all the movie and love the music in them so I had to have the sound track.
B0000AM6IY|5.0|My students laugh at the dancing and singing but still watch it. I will have them write a review on it and compare this DVD to others I purchased.
B005HV6Y84|5.0|I am a big Twilight fan and love the music in the movie's. My husband surprised me by loving this CD
B001RPIYV4|5.0|I recommend this DVD for students studying Romeo and Juliet. I relates to students more in this day. I found my students interested in the story and paying attention. Good purchase.
B009FB3XTA|5.0|Loved the music in the movie's and just had to have the sound track I love it and so does my Husband
B004SIP9U6|5.0|I can not show this DVD to my students but love watching it for myself. Costumes, dialoge, setting-- all worth watching.
B009FB3WQ4|5.0|It was not what I thought it was but it is still nice to watch. I wish it was Barbra singing.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|This is such a beautiful book, full of surprise and the honesty that Portia de Rossi brings with her intense words is just amazing. It is a must read book!
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I love the movie's and the music in them. I have all the sound track's and played all them this last trip.
B00AWTSRZY|5.0|I was never a big fan of this comic.  Being a Batman fan I had to have it.  The animation is excellent, and the voice acting superb.  This is a must have for any batman fan.
B001ED7C58|5.0|I have seen all the movie's and own all but the last which I will be getting on 3-2-13 love it.
B007FRHZ4A|5.0|This is an awesome game!  We love the figures the most and the kids play with them with or without the cards..
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app was really cool to use, right when I was about to get bored with it, I moved onto another city. Better than the first temple run!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Every so often you'll read a book that stays with you.  Wonder is one of those books. It's a book everyone should be required to read. Wonder is so much more than a &#34;kids&#34; book - it's a book that will really make you think about the kind of person you want to be and the kind of kids you want to raise.
B0090EHVMC|4.0|I rented this film for my 2 and half year old while he was sick. We enjoyed the movie, but he was a little young for it. I think in a couple years this would be a movie he would love. I love the book and thought the film did a great job converting the story to a movie. It was funny, cute, and sentimental. I would recommend it for kids 5 and up.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This app is fun and helpful. I love that I can check my battery charge and it. Let's you know before it is completely dead. Plus watching the bubbles while charging is fun as also. It drives my cat crazy.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|GREAT piece kept pages turning and excitement high plan on reading again to uncover the full mystery of agatha christie
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Great, easy read all about a boy discovering himself. Written letter format, which I love, the book follows a boy named Charlie, and his struggles at home and in his social life. You really become attached to Charlie, a freshman boy with an old soul. With all the ups and downs I was cheering on the sidelines. Not only do you fall in love with him, but all his fire as too!
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Well...the game is really fun and you want to keep playing it because you want to beat the other players core so it gets challenging. And I like the fact that you van play with your friends on Facebook! That is a really nice touch. But if I could change something about the game,I don't know what I would change to tell the truth. So it's alright now. Oh and I also like how you guys changed the theme of the game. Of how it is Rio and I love the movie that came out with the cartoons and the birds and it reminds me of it:)
B00ARAO720|3.0|Levitt and Shannon!!  Both are two of my favorite actors and I see academy awards for both within 10 years.<br />Let's put them in an action flick and see what zany and over the top things can happen!<br />Why God Why!!!!<br />Quicksilver.<br />If Quicksilver didn't star Kevin Bacon on a fixie shredding downtown up, then Premium Rush would never have happened.<br />Thank you Kevin.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great game. Buy it. You can make your own world, make underwater homes and join with friends. It is easy to use and is fun to play.
B009IEXKXI|2.0|Did you like Macgyver the TV show?<br />Your gonna love this.<br />Bonus if you really love technical jargon, geeking out to chemistry, and just love NASA.<br />The protagonist takes you on a journey on how to survive on mars till help arrives. How he got there, stranded and survived is explained.<br />Every 10 minutes something goes wrong and Mr. Martian [forgot the main characters name] walks us through how he solved the problem to get back on track.<br />That's it!!<br />Great story for .99 cents.<br />Better if it was .25 cents.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|We've seen similar games with different there's of tilting phone to 'eat ' stuff. The rules of what you need to do and what level you need to achieve stars are a bit confusing and unclear. The controls are not the best to maneuver. One frustrating thing is trying to avoid black did on a screen that is dark grey to dark black. Often makes it heard to see and strain your eyes. I'd probably choose one of the other apps with a similar play.. In a weird way, it reminds me of a snake or doodle grub with other twists
B00AEFY552|5.0|Although this entry on Amazon says (2013), it's a 2010 release.<br />I had to open it to check to see if the UPC code was yellow as it was covered by a white UPC sticker.<br />The disc itself was labeled &#34;B1R2&#34; on the back indicating it's the remastered version rather the earlier &#34;defective&#34; release.
B00992CF6W|5.0|game is awesome love it just got it still very fun try the game it is worth the money if your an a adult get it for your kids
0307895475|5.0|This book is as big as a phone book for a large city. It has so much in it that I couldn't find elsewhere. My only complaint is that bit all the current DLC's have been represented in this new edition. I hope they put out additional ad on books for the remaining and upcoming DLC's
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|This game is good, clean, innocent fun.I've loved Oregon trail since i was a kid in the 80s. My only complaint, though, is that this is one of those games which requires you to buy game dollars in order for  more options to play.
B009LT1YZ6|4.0|The game reminds me of Osmosis in that you are chasing circles around the screen. The black and white don't bother me it's kind of calming. I don't have the volume on so don't know about the music. It is a little hard to get the 3 stars though.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|A very entertaining game. Grandkids loved it and it is a nice way to spend some time when waiting in line or at an office.
B00785P2QC|4.0|I like this game as I have liked all the virtual city games, however this is a slightly different layout to the previous ones. However just as good.
B001F6TXME|5.0|I am happy I purchased this product, this allows me to ge some great night time photos. No complaints here.
B0079R8IYW|1.0|This is not the fault of the product but I cannot rate what I cannot test or use. This case will not fit the Kindle Fire. The cost and hassle of return mean I will donate this product with my next haul of stuff to Goodwill.
B009GEBBNQ|3.0|I don't get why this movie got such high reviews.  The plot was all over the place.  The acting was just terrible. The script was beyond cheesy.  I found myself bored in many places.  It honestly felt like each scene was planned 5 minutes before it was shot.  This goes to show you can put a bunch of hero characters together in one movie and forget about anything else and it will still make a ton of money.  Why do we reward movie makers for such crap?
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|So funny...laughed out loud. I would recommend to anyone and everyone. Tina Fey is so real but funnier than actual real people
0800184327|5.0|Cheyenne is the perfect partner for Vanessa and so very hot and a great dancer in my book ....great show
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I read it after 50 shades series and WOW! This tops it! I loved this book and the way it has sex, mystery, love, and keeps me smiling without realizing i'm even doing it. I recommend this book to those who wanted something more from the 50 shades series. This book is it! I don't know why Sylvia Day didn't get any hype on these crossfire books like the 50 shades author. Sylvia Day blew this outta the ball park. Can't wait to read the next book in June.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game! I think it was a lot better than the first temple run. I play it all the time.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Like the Hunger Games, the next two books are great. Enjoyed it books were great. Thank you for your imagination.
B0026P3G12|5.0|After hearing Susan sing &#34;I dream a Dream&#34; in her audition, this song, with her singing it, has become my favorite.
B003LZ5B7S|5.0|An incredible way for the Doctor to return. From the first episode, to the climatic shocking end of the series I was on the edge of my seat. The bigger budget allowed the producers to do so much more to add to the quality of the production. Christopher Ecclecston is excellent as the dark, brooding Doctor. Billie Piper is among the best of the show's companions as the adventurous Rose. This series will be great fun for any Doctor Who fan.
B009UX2YAC|3.0|Its a good game but can sometimes freeze or be stupid but other than that it is a good game.............but u should get the tour version because its waaaayy better :)
0345803485|1.0|If there's something that should happen in a book, that would be some sort of a plot. It seems that E L James decided to ditch it, thinking that a shot at erotica would do the job instead. It doesn't. 'Fifty Shades of Grey' is a hodgepodge of bad writing, obsessively repetitive expressions (the 'inner goddess' finished by giving me nightmares, really), tasteless dialogues and so much boring sex, is not even funny. Good luck to those who still wish to embrace the risk that is reading the next two books.
0756688701|5.0|Our five year old grandson is in love with the Cars movies and collects these cars. Each time we buy one for him he runs to get his encyclopedia and  checks off the car. When we want to buy him another car we just need to look at the book and see which ones he still needs!
B008CRC506|5.0|This is the best series ever produced for television: incredible original music, fabulously choreographed dance, wonderfully talented actors and dancers and a terrific story line.  I will treasure these dvds forever!
B007704HO6|5.0|\\"[[ASIN:B007704HO6 A Street Cat Named Bob]]\\" is about a cat that saves a man.<br /><br />James struggles in a not ideal way of like, till he found a tom cat in his building and decided to take care of him. But, true is that Bob, the tom cat, is the one healing James, helping him to get himself on his feet.<br /><br />I'm not the kind of biographical books reader, but I liked this one and learned a bit (great deal) from it.<br /><br />All the best wishes for James and Bob.
B005LHOKFS|5.0|I use this anytime I need to find a hotel and am not familiar with what's out there. It has pictures and reviews from hotels, restaurants to popular attractions.
B00422LESO|5.0|I couldn't put it down! It's been a while since a book caught me in that way. It's funny, enjoyable and full of romance, the kind that makes you giggle, sigh and melt.<br /><br />And also I learned a essential lesson: I don't need to find a Mr. Darcy... I just need a Mr. Nobley :) Ha!<br /><br />I just finished \\"[[ASIN:B007WT4M7O Midnight in Austenland]]\\", that is, fantastic, and I'm thinking to take a look to \\"[[ASIN:1599900734 Princess Academy]]\\". Shannon's books may be turning into a regular reading for me from now on.<br /><br />Summarizing, \\"Austenland\\" is worth it, fully recommended!
B00499QUK2|5.0|Feel bad that I took so long to try this out. This was a fantastic series and definitely worth the investment.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|best game ever. i love it! im so addicted. so much more exciting and intense than the first one. awesome! :)
0300176147|5.0|Hands down the best abbreviated history of the world.  So well written it is best read aloud. My 6year old boy and my 62 year old father both adore this book.  Consider this essential to your library!
B001HN6922|5.0|Movie arrived in great condition and in a short amount of time. Play's wonderfully! I'm a huge fan of Pixar. This will be added to my collection. Thank you!
B008QTVNUI|1.0|There is something wrong with the audio on this episode. The audio is messed up. There are 2 audio's going on at the same time. You hear the actors speaking current, and then you also hear about a 2minute advance audio at the same time. VERY ANNOYING.<br />Hope all episodes Amazon is offering is not of this quality.
B004GYY714|3.0|Bought this app for my phone. It a good app but I didn't use it all that much. So I deleted it.
1455523550|5.0|I love anything he writes! I just saw the movie but as usual it wasn't nearly as good as the book!
B003VS0CWO|5.0|Wife loved it. Couldn't ask for more. She loves RHPS and just destroyed her DVD set, so this was needed and a perfect gift!
B005RJ6DUK|5.0|If you haven't seen this movie you must rent or purchase it.  This movie has some really funny parts to it.  If you ask people about this movie most people can remember a great part of the movie.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|I havent gotten the video yet because it doesnt come out unitl the end of February 28th. But if it's anything like the<br />1st series..will be awesome Im sure of that.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is entertaining and fun I let my little causing play it when she is board my baby cousin even likes it
B008FYZIVY|5.0|This series is such a good story. Even my husband loves it so much he bought me the series for Valentines day.<br />What a sweetheart. I only wish the series wouldnt end.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Nice to keep up with weather on the go both when travelling or at home. Nice to have present and 15 day range.
B0014BY72Q|3.0|I saw this movie when It was new and thought it was great. It is still ok for an old sifi
B009H2PCNC|5.0|Fantastic sonicscapes that subtly carry you into the artwork or wherever your mind may take you. It's a little short, which just means i wanted more.
B001BANK32|4.0|I may be jaded because I love the film (Kubrick version) so much, but I felt that this was just an average King novel.  I really didn't feel for the characters and thought that everything with the lawn animals was just too much.  If you are just getting into King I would suggest another of his works, especially if you are a big fan of the Kubrick film.
B00846F1YW|4.0|Very engaging and not too challenging.  I really enjoy hidden object games, but not if they're too hard. I play onnmy Kindle and with such a tiny screen scenes need to be clear and distinct. Mysteryville 2 succeeds!
B007BFSYMS|5.0|We love having this available when we don't have the sound machine with us. Also nice at night when baby won't sleep.
B008CX2A2I|3.0|I bought the bluetooth adapter for the same reason anyone else would; to stream music from Google Play or iTunes. This device certainly allows that. However, you would have to go to your phone settings and disable all alerts. For instance, do you have a foghorn, whistle or bells ringing alert set up for incoming text messages, emails, FB notifications? Each of these sounds will play through the Onkyo, disrupting the song. The song will fade out, your alert notification plays out, then the song fades back in. That is annoying as hell.<br /><br />Here's another one: Let's say you stop listening to music. You switch back over to Cable or Blu-Ray, but you've left the USB adapter plugged in (there is, after all, a port on the back of the receiver to connect it to, as well as one on the front). When an alert drums up on the phone, the Onkyo will automatically switch back to the Bluetooth Device mode, taking you away from your movie or show. Ridiculous.<br /><br />As a fix, I have moved my USB Bluetooth Adapter to the front of the receiver, with the understanding that I must unplug it after each use. Stack that up against Apple TV, or something similar, and this adapter is plain junk. I dont have Apple TV, nor do I ever plan to purchase any product named after a fruit. But, in this case, I would have to admit that users of the entirely over-priced Fruit Tech will enjoy their product much more than the average Android system user can with this Bluetooth Adapter.
B0042U94UQ|5.0|The package came exactly as described, had heard about the movie, was so glad it was listed for sale as I couldn't find in stores.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I first found this game when I was recommend it by a friend and I've loved it ever since, it's not laggy, it's quite lifelike (well, for a cartoon anyway) and all that is free! It's not too easy and I like a challenging game so therefore, I would recommend this game to anyone! :)
B003AO1SVS|5.0|In fact, all are excellent. I live in Akron, OH. These guys are so talented. Amazing they got so big.
B0086449YA|5.0|I really enjoyed this double CD and always enjoy his albums. I think Mark Knopfler has always been an excellent solo artist and look forward to his next release.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|Such a unique style. Tired of mainstream music that seems just so mainstream. The style is something you normally don't run into often. I want all the music.
B004SOR4H6|5.0|I love twitter but I need to know how to make a hash tag so tell me how @HRWharrison plz
B008JFUMT2|3.0|Yes, John McClane is back.  That's good, except this particular outing is not exactly the best of the quintet.  In fact, at best it probably ranks somewhere around the fourth or fifth of the bunch.  The franchise is getting lazy.  REALLY lazy, but more on that in a minute.<br /><br />On the flip side, you probably didn't come to this one to think, anyway.<br /><br />This time McClane is in Russia: his estranged son Jack (Jai Courtney) has turned up in Moscow, charged with murder, and he's copping a plea deal by testifying against a highly popular political prisoner whose trial could bring down a (need I say it?) corrupt high-ranking Russian official.<br /><br />But as always, there are complications.  As the commercials tell you, his son is a CIA spy, deep undercover, and the only thing about him that's real is his deep-seated anger at his father.  Regardless, John flies out to Moscow (filled in for nicely by shots of Budapest, Hungary).<br /><br />Given the immensity of the case against the dissident, that John and Jack will even see each other would be problematical; that they would meet would seem impossible.  But of course the impossible comes true, and the pair go around Russia shooting up everything.<br /><br />That any of this makes sense is utterly beside the point.  For instance, there is practically no interference by the Russian police; at no time during any of the many over-the-top sequences do any of the cops seem to be anywhere in the picture...during helicopter shootouts and battles on rooftops, there is no sign of the local constabulary. But then again, Russia's known to be a pretty free-and-easy laid-back country, isn't it?  So this would make sense.<br /><br />Additionally, when the two McCanes are running around Moscow with the country's Most Wanted Man, THEY DON'T EVEN COVER HIS HEAD WITH A HAT.  And nobody notices him...even bleeding from a bullet wound in his arm.  But if I have toilet paper stuck to my heel, I catch it from everyone.<br /><br />Though director John Moore ([[ASIN:B001O5187E Max Payne (Unrated)]], [[ASIN:B000J00SDK Flight Of The Phoenix]], [[ASIN:B000L9EKL0 Behind Enemy Lines]]) is not exactly an A-movie guy, he does a fair job of framing close ups.  I cannot remember a Die Hard with as many head-and-shoulder shots, and it works here in the set ups, especially because of the character in Willis' wrinkled eyes and bald pate...and that's before he gets the crap beaten out of him.<br /><br />And yes, this plot is pretty much paper thin...at least in the other stories, when all hell broke loose and McClane  began working his magic, he was usually lost in the midst of a larger story that required the full attention of the police or whomever.  But, as mentioned earlier, there is no hint of any real police action...after one firefight, both the Russians and the American CIA seem to throw up their hands and say, \\"Hey, this is too rough for us!\\" and drop right out of the picture.<br /><br />But the movie is chock full of enjoyable car crashes, shoot outs, helicopter stunts and full-blown confrontations that it's unlikely you'll care much about all of this, anyway.  Each stunt is as gigantic as always, so don't think you're being cheated in this regard.  If you came to see big stunts, you won't be disappointed in the least.<br /><br />It's just as jam-packed with scenes of mayhem as the other Die Hards, and some of it (but not a lot) is worth the admission price: a scene where they fall through several levels of debris, boards, glass and ceilings (as seen in the commercials); car chases that include military vehicles being launched through the air; and the destruction of an entire floor of a hotel by a military helicopter is striking.<br /><br />And the demise of one particularly onerous bad-guy is particularly crunching: we just begin to wonder if the film has entirely given up on originality - since this villain's initial downfall is virtually identical to one in the original, first, movie - whenall of a sudden something comes along and practically vaporizes him...to the amused groans of the movie audience.<br /><br />All in all, this Die Hard is a fun movie, but it doesn't live up to its potential...the franchise could be at risk if it doesn't do better than this.  While it could be surmised the series is possibly looking to set up Jai Courtney's taking the reins, and he does a passable job, he lacks the wise-cracking persona that identified this series and its three previous sequels.<br /><br />But if they want to continue, it has to do more, ESPECIALLY at today's prices: it's one thing to pay for myself and my daughter to see a weak but entertaining movie, but to have paid almost $30 to do so?<br /><br />You have to do better, Die Hard.all of a sudden something comes along and practically vaporizes him...to the amused groans of the movie audience.<br /><br />All in all, this Die Hard is a fun movie, but it doesn't live up to its potential...the franchise could be at risk if it doesn't do better than this.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game its feeling awesome mote awesome than temple run and temple run is fun but subway surfed is awsomer
B0013TXA5Y|3.0|I feel like this book was written for teenagers, but the main character who is a teenager, doesn't act like one. I liked that there was action, it was very descriptive. I wouldn't call it more romantic than action packed... but there was a bit of romance in there... I don't know. I'm sort of 'meh' about it.

B009JBZH54|5.0|Best Batman series ever. It has an ultraviolet code so it can be downloaded to IPad, IPhone or laptop (great on the go - car, airplane...). The blue ray version was sold out everywhere. I got this trilogy for a great price on sale here on Amazon, so it was totally worth it. I got it for my husband as a gift, and he loves it. It is a must have for Batman fan or collector. It comes with a special booklet.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I chose this rating because although the movie itself was amazing, the book went so much more in-depth and the details made me feel like I was there.
B006X8GFBQ|2.0|Its too slow and a bit boring.  Im taking a long time to get through it all.  I normally like his books.

B004FGMDOQ|4.0|Never read this author before and I was very happy with it.  A lot of fun to read.  Would like to read more
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed this novel and found the main character to be as uncertain and as off his rocker as any normal person dealing with disappointment can be.
B0019FOC5E|5.0|Love, love, love this CD.  I can't get enough of the songs.  I listen to it while driving to pass the time.
B00005MP58|5.0|This is a &#34;keeper&#34;. Better than the BBC version. And I love Colin Firth. What else can I say about it.
B003R0MF5I|5.0|Very funny show, and it great to watch it with no commercials and waiting a week in between each show.
B0029LHWL8|3.0|The stofy in itself is fine. The paperback edition is small, not a comfotable one to handle, but the type is good size and dark. We older folks, even after cataract surgery amd with glasses, like dark type with decent leding.
B007MU85D0|5.0|This is one of those albums I can repeat and don't dislike any songs. Talented artists plus the tracks sound great on my Kindle Fire HD.
B001F6TXME|5.0|Perfect. Works great on my D3100. Exactly what I needed. Easy to use, compact, made my night shooting a success.
B004QKNXIQ|5.0|My teenaged daughter and I thoroughly enjoyed this movie. It was a new spin on an old tale &#34;Rapunzel.&#34; Overall, we would consider owning this movie.
B008AUGEFC|4.0|What additional praise can possibly be heaped upon Cloud Atlas?  It's Exhibit A for the brief as to why people who read continue to read novels.  Big hearted, humanistic, thrilling--what more could you want?  Well, how about unafraid to approach a Big Theme.  Finally, the excellence of the writing--kudos for credibly tackling so many voices, attention to historical and future detail, and tweaking conventional narrative development.<br /><br />If I had to criticize at all it would be that the antagonisms simplify a complex world into good and evil--not alot of shades here, and characters can be plopped in one category or the other.  Ordinarily I would find that Manichean struggle stale and puerile, but Mitchell pulls it off.  It reminds me of Bryan...\\"A man can be born again; the springs of life can be cleansed instantly...If this is true of one, it can be true of any number.  Thus, a nation can be born in a day if the ideals of the people can be changed.\\"  This book makes you want to believe.  However, for those of a more skeptical bent, the principle can linger until it finds readier soil in life.<br /><br />The movie was also excellent, again, if you're openminded about the fundamental premise (they are interesting to compare--the movie has its own problems, but also I think makes certain improvements/tweaks to the storyline).  Even if you're not so inclined, there's plenty to enjoy here--a virtuoso performance from an author at the height of his powers.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. Found it hard to put down. Eric Blenheim does a great job of capturing the reader and brining them into the life of Adam Brown. Highly recommend.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Love the book! I loved that Pat was narrating and we got to see and feel things through his perspective. Naive, honest, hopeful, childlike in his search for his silver lining...I'm glad he found it!
B008JFUTT0|5.0|I cannot recommend this DVD enough, if you like docs and music. We saw an interview with the director on, I think, 60 minutes, and we ordered it that night.  It was not yet released, but when it came about two weeks ago, I was excited to give it to my husband for a Valentine's Day gift.  We popped popcorn and watched it TWICE in one night.  BUY IT!!!!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|Nicholas Sparks has a way of grasping his audiences attention through riveting details of smothered love and emotion. This book gave me the chills and was an absolute pleasure to read.<br /><br />Olivia
B008FYZIVY|1.0|I am SO disappointed that this \\"complete\\" set is missing two key episodes from season 2: episodes 5 and 6. I couldn't believe it when the storyline jumped forward so abruptly. I went on pbs' website to determine which episodes are missing. I ordered season 3 on amazon when it became available; I can only hope it is complete.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|This is one of the most addicting games I have found.<br />You can play a nice leisurely style game, or a fast paced style game.<br />Very precise and refreshingly accurate touch screen controls.<br />This is a topnotch, must have game!

B007WFR0QS|5.0|This CD is amazing!<br />If you like Lauren Hill, Duffy, Laura Izabor, Alicia Keyes and Adele you will Love this CD.<br />Emeli Sande' is a combination of many of my favorite female artists.<br />Every track sounds very different from the track before.<br />Get ready USA for Emeli Sande'!
B004YM6JI2|3.0|I have loved this show since it's first season and still watch it because I love the dynamic between Padalecki and Ackles as the Winchester brothers.  With that said this is not a favorite season.  If you love the show and need your fix of the WInchesters then yes this is a season you will want.  However, the writers need to include more ghosts and Wendigos and shapeshifters in their seasons.  I am getting a little tired of the angels and demons crap.  Plus they need to find a way to bring back Bobby.  They did with Castiel.
B004FQX59I|5.0|Lots of great actors, very informative with lots of back ground history.<br />Kevin Costner gave an excellent performance in this outstanding movie.
B0029O08WA|4.0|I am not a big Twilight fan but I will say that the music is the best thing of the series.  I would say this is a very good CD because I like at lwast half the songs on this CD.  Howver, the music is still pretty angusty and I think teenagers will feel really in tune with the music but as an adult I cannot say I do anymore.
B004SOR4H6|3.0|I don't use my twitter account on my kindle as much as my cell phone due to the fact that my twitter account can not be uploaded as a widget.
B001ED7C58|4.0|I think that out of all the music from the Twilight Saga this is the best one because it has Muse and Paramore on it and thye are a couple of bands that I like.  I also love the sond by Wine and Iron that is the prom song at the end of the movie. But the other songs are in that teenage angusty genre.
B008OOYALE|5.0|All those people that say this game doesn't work on the kindle fire...that's bull*** thus game is awesome. The graphics are great &amp;the dragons are better than other crappy dragon games. This game us a must for all viewers
B008YWY0HK|5.0|If you love Disney Pixar movies then you will love this one and it will probably be your all time favorite like mine.  When Pixar first started movies I loved Toy Story the best then Monster Inc and now...Brave!  The animation is incredible.  It is so vivid and gorgeous and the storyline is wonderful.  It has it's typical Disney theme were the main character learns a very important lesson by the end of the movie, which Merida does.  But aside from the life lesson she learns the real reason I love this movie is that the main character is a woman and that she is not some helpless princess like some of them are in the Disney movies.  She writes her own fate.  She is Katniss Everdean in the world of Disney animation.  And if that is something that you want to teach your kids then you must own this movie.  It is incredible.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|God Bless Her Whitney Houston never failed trying to entertain us. And she does on this CD. Particular favorite of mine is Million Dollar Bill.
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This is in fact my favorite season of the series because Andy Whitfield is Spartacus (Sorry Liam McIntyre).  I love this show. The writing was wonderfull, the costumes, the sets, the acting and the action and well...blood.  It is incredible.  And even though Andy Whitfield is gone he will forever be the first and best Spartacus to me.  If you loved the HbO series Rome then you will love this series too which is told from the side of both slave and Roman but in reality we all root for the slaves and the rebellion in the end.
B000002VSN|5.0|Great CD with Whitney Houston'z soaring vocals. Particular favorite is Step By Step. She was atrue diva that everyone tried to copy.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|This show got even better for the second season.  The costumes, writing and storylines are even better. I love how this season things get even more involved with the servants and the lords and ladies.  I love how the line between master and servant is becoming so blurred that the chauffer marries the youngest daughter of the lord of the manor.  I enjoyed watching how everyone is trying to work out the changes that are being brought on by the end of WW 1.  If you love the first season then you will love the second season.
B0000E1WKE|5.0|Missing Whitney Houston it is still wonderful to hear her voice and know we will always have it.On this CD of Holiday classics she does very well.
B005LAIHYU|3.0|So I read the book before I saw the movie and well. They are nothing alike.  The only 3 things in the book that made the movie is that there are vampires that Abraham Lincoln fights and has help from his friend Henry and he became the 16th president.  That is it. I liked the book better.  If you read the book and liked it maybe try not to watch the movie.  For me the only redeeming quality of this movie was that Dominic Cooper was in it as Henry and I like him as an actor.  That is about it.
B0000VCZKM|5.0|Family musical anyone can enjoy. Carol Burnett is a blast to watch as Miss Hannigan. In a supporting role I particularly liked seeing Colleen Zenk who played Barbara Ryan on As The World Turns for many years.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I loved Christpher Nolan's revamp of the Batman world.  I have loved Batman/Bruce Wayne since Michael Keaton donned the cape back in 1991.  Batman is my favorite super hero because he is just a man, no super powers like Superman or Spiderman, just a lot of wonderful toys (were did he get them?).  I think that of all the actors to have taken the Batman/Bruce Wayne persona Christian Bale is by far my favorite.  I loved this movie and the other 2 as well. I watch them again and again at least a couple times a month.  It is just an incredible trilogy and I hope there will be more to come.  If you have seen it then you will know what I am talking about at the end.  If not then you must see it but not before watching the first 2.  P.S. Heath Ledger's Joker is phenomenal.
B009O5CLZY|5.0|great fun! great graphics.  and where else do you get to ride a yeti??  caution: very addictive!  try at your own risk ;-)
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I actually saw the movie the Hunger Games before I read the books.  I must say I was not disappointed.  I loved all 3 books and I am glad to hear that all 3 will be made into movies.  My main reson for loving these books is that the main character Katniss Everdean is such a wonderful role model for young girls.  That she will do anything for her family mainly for her sister Prim.  That she ends up in the games to protect her and as a big sister myself I can relate to that.  I too would do anything for my little sister.  I also love how even through out this whole series that Katniss' main need is to survive and live and it is not all about finding a boyfriend ( I must make my anti-Twilight stab here).  I also love how that in the end there is a somewhat happily ever after but that there was big cost for it.  Katniss Everdean is a much beloved heroine.
B0098460O4|1.0|Jonathan & Charlotte need to &#34;DUMP&#34; Simon Cowell  SYCOmusic.  The recording quality of this cd is horrendous OMG!  I was so disappointed when listening to this cd, someone took these two awesome and talented singers and completely commercialized and took away their uniqueness.  Jonathan sounds like he is in another room down the hall and he does not even sound like the singer we all fell in love with, were did  his uniqueness go. The Music and the background singers overpower both of their voices, and there is nothing special about this cd.  Jonathan & Charlotte we want to her YOUR original voices and style, that is what we fell in love with, stop listening to these people who are telling you  how to sing and what to sing.  Charlotte has one of the most beautiful voices I have heard in a long time.  I hope their next cd is produced by someone else.  Charlotte, Simon Cowell judges people by there looks!  find someone else with a little character to produce your beautiful talent.
B003CFBQBW|3.0|My favorite thing of the series probably the only thing I like about the Twilight Saga is the music.  With that said this is not my favorite album.  For me there were only about 3 songs I liked on the CD and tht was towards the end of it.
B005OCFGTO|5.0|Excellent gift. I should have bought one for myself! I especially liked how small the packaging was. I was afraid it would be a giant box, but it wasn't much bigger than one DVD box.
B0072OFM28|4.0|While I miss Andy Whitfield's portrayl of Spartacus Liam McIntyre did a wonderful job filling in some big shoes.  The  beginning and contiuation of the rebellion and Spartacus' revenge on Glaber for the death of Mira is still a good story.  The characters and the actors that play them learn and evolve through the season and thankfully do not beomce stagnant.  The writing, costumes, sets and the action scenes are still up there with the first season and got better as Spartacus learned to become a true leader.  Again a favorite if you like HBO's Rome.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|We love and will watch again this 3-DIsc DVD of the famous Downton Abbey series.  Wonderful acting, good plot lines.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  I started it yesterday and finished today.  (I'm in the hospital and have plenty of time on my hands.)  I loved all the characters and how Quick is able to set the scene of a NJ neighborhood with all its quirks and close-knit relationships.<br /><br />I definitely recommend this book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The best game I can't stop playing it's adicting I love it the best game ever anyone reading this to see if u should get it well GET IT!
B00AMBH70S|4.0|I think Jeremy Renner did a job, knowing Matt Damon is not portraying his part of Jason Bourne any longer, this film had a lot of twist and turn it keep's you on edge through out the film.
1451624468|4.0|Very enjoyable. Articulate and doesn't waste time with speculation. Recommend for anyone interested in physics + cosmology or advocating science. Would not recommend for anyone looking for an in depth philosophical inquiry.
B0084B5TK8|5.0|This was one of the first classic novels I ever read, at age 12. \\"Dracula\\" started within me a lifelong love of literature, and good story telling, ( and left me sleeping with the lights on for a week afterward.) Bram Stoker does not romanticize the vampire, which may not sit well with younger readers. This story does not make a person long for the wretched existence that his undead creations experience. His vampires neither \\"sparkle\\" nor burn in the sunlight, but they are stronger at night. DRACULA does not fall in love with his victims. He is not wanting to reunite with the reincarnated soul of his long dead wife.  He is only seeking to expand his \\"territory\\" as he did in life. DRACULA practiced necromancy in his human life in an attempt to extend life beyond the death of his human body, and succeeded, but as a changed being. He infects his prey, and a dead victim becomes a lovely killing machine - a predator, devoid of humanity. These Fledgling vampire creations lose most of their personality, along with their empathy, and their immortal soul. As vampire lore goes, these demonic  creatures are infinitely creepier than the sexy, appealing \\"True Blood\\" and \\"Twillight\\" vampires, (who retain a sense of self.)
B003ODIZL6|2.0|It was pretty helpful. I enjoyed it. The reason why I gave it 2 stars because well it didn't give me all the words I wanted to look up.
B001SN78JO|3.0|Not as good as many Jim Carrey movies.  The plot was cute and the characters well cast, but I don't think i will watch it again.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This games is awesome because you run through Rio getting chased but I also like the power ups if you can you should get this game!!!!!
B0000071GA|5.0|I first heard this band in 1982 when the Headhunter album came out and I loved every song. To me at the time this is what heavy metal was all about. Loud vocals, heavy guitars and killer drums
0765325950|5.0|I've been reading this story for over 20 years and through all the twists and turns this was a good wrap up of the epic journey.  Though I'm happy to see the end, I would be happier still to see it continue.
B009SJ3GUK|1.0|I had watched the pilot and first season of this series and was looking forward to this.  It was such a disappointment!  It was very poorly done and the writing for the two episodes I saw was terrible.  I actually contacted Amazon to get my money back which they very promptly did.  I am no prude and usually love weird, strange shows but this was unwatchable.
B009A87X80|2.0|Themusic on this album is not nar as good as other allbums that I have containing some of the same songs as presented here.  Very bad quality for such a lovley voice.
B009HQ9UHC|1.0|I thought it was going to be just as fun as Angry Birds, but I'm disappointed. I'm glad it was free.
B002ONV5E6|2.0|Watched it on kindle fire hd.<br />Mulitple fast scenes were blurred and wavy.<br />Other scenes appeared faded and grainy.<br />I assume it was the DVD and not a problem with the Kindle Fire HD...who knows.<br />Sorry...
B0064TVQ5E|3.0|Mostly easy with a few that take a few tries.  Great way to get lost for 5 minutes or less.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love it so much. Its a lot of fun and there's never any glitches...good product...I really recommend<br /> It. La la la la la.
B0009MDPYM|5.0|Decent movie; good action; no scrapes on the disk; NOT Biblically correct... it will make you think though; great ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|for you people who don't know how update try 4shared.com and sign up for free just search the update and it will come up but you have install it from the top left if you have a kindle fire I still play this with my dad and its awesome
B00846F1YW|4.0|I got this as a free app.I have not finished it yet but so far it's ok..I like hidden object games and this is a good one.lots of things to look for..this is my first mysteryville game.I never played the first one..so I really don't know the story line that well..
B0062OCNAI|4.0|This was so well written and such a different take on the usual suspense novel. I couldn't put it down, and as a mother myself, it brought me to tears.
B00846REIS|5.0|Enjoyed it beginning to end, very sweet and endearing. Characters were realistic and relatable. Can't wait to start reading the second book!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|If you love The Black Keys you'll love this. I listen to this over and over and have loaded a lot of the songs into my workout playlists. Looking forward to seeing the Black Keys live in July.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers.it is so much fun and a great time passer. I recommend this for people of all ages.
B00B22IJXK|3.0|This app is great for editing photos and creating meme, but I think the screneshots are misleading. It would be very hard to make those photos with this app. If it wasn't misleading, I would have given it 5 stars as a photo editor.
1433502445|5.0|Great bible.  Lots of detail.  The only issue I have is that the pages seem to be a little too wafer thin - almost like a small pocket bible would be.  Other than that - near perfect.
B0032CVAQQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship. Easy to read, easy to comprehend it just makes sense.
B000JML7EC|4.0|worth a read, this is the free edition and was a great classic to read. Much better reading than viewing a mini series in my humble opinion....
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone.<br />It teaches you many things about attitude, feelings,<br />courage and hope.Never giving up.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Best free calculator...simple and easy to use. Only thing you will need for your everyday needs...and some other more off the wall calculations!
B00AMBH70S|1.0|This movie had misguided direction, no character development, and a very poor script. As one of most boring movies I have ever watched and movies so do not waste your time renting or buying. The story plot was all over the place and made no real sense of where it was trying to take and/or where it took you.By the end you just want it to be over.
B0078ZTWP4|5.0|Compact, durable build, easy to find with blinking led finder, would recommend for anyone as emergency or camping lamp, buy it!
B008D36INE|1.0|I found this film self indulgent and painfully dull. From the start I was massively irritated by the jarring, screeching violin score. This went on for so long that I genuinely thought that there wasn't going to be any dialogue, just a succession of flashbacks with that terrible music laid over the top.<br /><br />Finally, the music abated and led into an hour and a half of complete misery with iceberg slow, laborious cinematography. This would include in the main part the Rachel Weisz being filmed sitting or standing in a drab 1950's bedsit, usually smoking and looking thoughtfully into space/out the window. The rest of the film is filled with people in the depths of despair all for their own various reasons.<br /><br />When the movie ends it's a relief.
B00846REIS|4.0|This was a good book but it is just like 50 shades of gray.  Still enjoyed it though.  Can't wait to read the next book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I love this game it is super fun an adicting you need to get this game I know you will love it
B000A2IPP0|5.0|I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility.  It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition.  She loves the movie.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I tried out many solitaire apps and ended up deleting all of them except for this simple version. Game play flows nicely and graphics fit and work well for this classic game.  Nice job!
0767812166|5.0|I bought this for a friend who lives in an Assisted Living Facility.  It was packaged perfectly and arrived in perfect condition.  She loves the movie.
B002ZG99G8|5.0|This movie is hilarious. Lot's of sarcasm, pop-cultural references and detached irony. Not to mention nihilism. All the things one would expect from a Gen-X film. It came out about the same time as the A-Team but has it beat hands down. Very impressed. I think you will be too.<br />Enjoy.<br /><br />By David Feeney, Author [[ASIN:B00CWRQAJY Terror On The High Seas]]
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I have read all three of Colleens book.  She is a great author.  Slammed, Point of retreat, and now hopeless are definately worth reading.  They all are books you cannot put down and hold your interest through out.  Can't wait for more.
B004D9FLJE|5.0|I was very impressed with the quality of production, and the choice of music. All the actors are very convincing in their roles, especially Jane Lynch.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|It's a really quite handy app, I installed it on my Nana's kindle as well as mine and I also put it on my Grandad's galaxy tab and as it is a free app I recommend it to anyone, the only thing that can be a tad annoying is that every time I plug my Kindle in to charge the app opens up automatically and interrupts whatever I am doing.
0141335734|4.0|My son was really into the lightning thief so I was looking for books he might like and I saw these at walmart. I got him the whole series.  well at least the ones that are out so far.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you are an apocalyptic story lover, zombie fan, or horror lover, this book is for you. It recounts individual experiences of survivors of the war. It's intelligently written with great depth as to how things would probably go down in reality if such a plague rose to take us. Not just your everyday \\"survive in a house/building/shopping mall scenario but multiple scenarios from around the world, personal and political ,and everything that comes after. It'll blow your mind like a bullet to the head. Seriously, stuff you never thought of.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is a very game I like it a lot it is nice game it is a very good game I love it
B00AE9UYJ4|3.0|This game definitely isn't the computer game! But it's better than those bs versions of Slender on the kindle. It needs more variety and is very slow and plain.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Loved it! I have never been disappointed by DeMille's book. Would highly recommended for any thrill seekers out here.Happy reading.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|A wonderful tale of human survival. A great book club read...so much to discuss. I felt like I was in the middle of the ocean with P
B0002XNSY0|4.0|I am sure this is not for everybody. Like most of Kurbrick's work, this is a head scratcher. It certainly makes you think, as in, what the heck was he thinking about? It is brillient and crazy. Sellers is off the charts good in multiple parts. What happened to George C. Scott? He was wonderful in so many things in the sixties. He is at his insane best here. Being a writer, i was impressed at how the director tells the story just by showing gauges in the cockpit of the airplane.
B0068LYEHA|5.0|Good book, very funny, very touching as well.  British humor to say the least and a good dose of feminism at its finest.
B001KL3GY0|5.0|Love this album for its rock quality & lyrics - But then again I love the band & their other albums too!
B003G4W49C|5.0|Great read and story.  A truly unpredictable sci-fi story and very heartwarming!  I would enjoy more reads like this one!
B009FA98JU|5.0|I always keep one of these in my bag so I can connect my MacBook to a projector or external monitor.  The Apple-brand adaptors are expensive, but always work perfectly
1468179993|5.0|Jeremey Donovan's book is a goldmine of information for experienced speakers who are trying to improve their speaking skills and reach the next level.  Having attended a TED conference years ago and as someone who watches the TED videos, I have attempted to understand what makes TED speakers stand out from the rest.  Donovan breaks down the techniques of these world-class speakers and gives the experienced speaker practical strategies to become a TED-quality speaker.  He covers every aspect of giving an exceptional speech including the conception of an idea, developing the content, story, and structure of the speech, and improving your delivery and design of the performance!  This book is absolutely a \\"must have\\" for speakers who wants to improve their craft and art of professional speaking.
B0034JGBM0|5.0|This is one of my favorite White Stripes albums.  Hearing their live work is just great.  A must-have if you like Jack White!
0345350499|5.0|When I find a good book...I say I found a good book.  If you love the Arthurian legends, you should read this.  This is the same story told through the eyes of the women folk of the period.  Fascinating, well-written, intelligent, and turns the original on its side.  Why didn't I find this sooner?  Love!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|just as fun as the first one but it is even better but they should of atleast add more characters
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Enjoyed playing this game. Sad that it didn't last long enough. Can't wait to play the rest . Looking forward to the equal.
B004AKCME8|5.0|It has been a long time since an animated movie really moved me, but this surely did.  Great message of good over evil, and characters that you can not help but love.
B0053O89WY|5.0|This is one of my favorite comedies!  It reminds me of so many people I've known for so much of my life.  To quote Sheldon, &#34;It's a hoot-and-a-half!&#34;
B007AFBYYY|4.0|Loved the action. Exciting story and special feats. Scenery was fantastic.  Always love to see action movies about mountain climbing.  It takes a special kind of person to tackle such a challenge.
B004L9MFM2|5.0|This book did not by any means disappoint me at all. It is filled with plot-twisters and great writing, the only downside being that very little actually happens until about half-way into the book.
B000001ESP|5.0|This release displays how much creativity and talent is missing from the last 20 years of Rock and Pop music. Triple WOW and addictive.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I never would have imagined myself reading a Nicholas Sparks book, but now that I have I don't regret it. No wonder it was made into a movie. This book is incredible, breath taking, and keeps you on the edge of your seat. You have Katie, a woman running away from an abusive husband. Then you have Alex, a widowed man raising his two children. Both of them knowing the risk they will take if they get involved with one another, but doing it anyway. But Katie 's past is still her present and come back at any moment. All she wants is to feel safe, and she has that, with Alex. Creating her safe haven in the middle of all her destruction.<br />One thing I would change though is the ending. I liked it but I would have wanted a better look into Katie and Alex's future. But as far as the ending goes, I loved this book.
B001BKG9RQ|5.0|Heard this on Pandora, had to have it!  Great sounds.  Great Performance.  a b c d e f g h i j k l m n o p q
B002U3CCF6|3.0|Although the last chapter was a cliff hanger, the lead up to the story climax was just not exciting enough.  Good twist at the end but lacked impact.
B004SIIBGU|1.0|Does not import saved sellers or permit access to adult items among other problems. Why release a half done app?
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|I love this book and I watched the movie 2/15/so that was nice can't wait for the next movie/book.But waiting requires you to wait and I shall
B005J4VV28|5.0|I didn't think i could buy this online. Me and my sister watched this all the time. I will buy the rest of the cartoons later so I can have a complete set.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers it is Awesome,and cool I love how the kids are being chased by the cop and the cute little dog. I love that you can use it with a kindel or iPod I'm happy that I have one of each so I can enjoy this wonderful game.thanks to the  creators who made this game I love it so much hope u make something similar.
B00821PCJS|2.0|Boring.  With shows like 24, Lost, Walking Dead, Homeland, Once Upon a Time, etc setting standards for originality, acting, plotting, and/or special effects this show underachieves spectacularly.  Might be nice bonding show to watch with kids if it handles the rest of the season right, but I could not get past season-opener.
B001GCUNYO|1.0|The copy protection on this movie prevented it from playing in both my TV (Sony Bravia KDL-40EX40B) or my computer.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|This is a pretty fun game.  As usual with G5 games it will.let you play for a short time for free, then you have to pay to open the rest of the game.  The graphics are good and the story line is pretty interesting.
B000007T2Z|5.0|Bought this CD (which he loves) for my cousin and he received it exactly as described: used, in excellent condition. A++
B00AE4OGCU|5.0|I bought the Kindle edition on the recommendation of a friend for \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\". I am not going to analyse the writer's style or convictions - I don't do that. I like a good read, and this is one of the best I have come across. Extremely well written, well researched (I Googled some of the mentioned locations), and well edited. I agree with the many who say they could not put the book down. Me too. In fact at one point I wondered if my constant reading was affecting my marriage relationship. Seriously, these are three novels that you should read. Thought provoking - yes. Whose side will you be on when you reach the end? And what an ending - just when you think the party's over! I will miss my time with Lisbeth. Shame there won't be more from this author.
B00AJRQLTI|5.0|This is a great accompaniment to the music. I never thought of rating the booklet, but since Amazon gave me the chance, I figured why not?<br /><br />Fans of the operetta will LOVE the musical movie version, and this booklet is a good companion to the songs. I love being able to feel the raw emotions and hear the timeless story played out in song over and over again.<br /><br />Follow your bliss,<br />Ronda Del Boccio, the Story Lady
B008ASLK8A|1.0|Great Movie if only we could watch it.  My wife purchased this for me as a holiday gift and we still can't watch the digital version.  Has constantly said unavailable.  I contacted Amazon customer service once about this and the person told me that it sometimes happens.<br /><br />DON'T EVER PAY FOR A DIGIAL VERSION FROM AMAZON.  I WOULD GIVE IT 0 STARS IF IT WERE AN OPTION.
B004GHNIRK|5.0|I actually saw the operetta live on stage some years before I read this book for the first time. I guarantee there are a few places you will want to skip, but the timeless story of decisions, love and loss is one you will not want to miss.<br /><br />Follow your bliss,<br />Ronda Del Boccio, the Story Lady
B008OOYALE|3.0|Why is it that android users are limited? IOS users have ways to send dragons on quests and trade dragons for gems to get special dragons that android users can not get. Please fix this!!!
B002U0KHMY|4.0|Neither my wife nor I are into dark, grim crime and suspense shows. Not terribly keen, for example, on those CSI shows and coroner shows (though fond of Crossing Jordan, because the characters are so engaging). That's why our faves tend to be things like Monk and Psych and Remington Steele. White Collar's in that tradition of light-touch mystery suspense. The teaming of the master con man with the straightlaced FBI guy makes for a nifty dynamic with lots of potential for friendship and conflict. Just a lot of fun.
B009Z5975A|5.0|Awesome deal Three movies great blu ray transfer to HD love it 80's classics. A must get for movie collectors.
B0091HVMVO|5.0|What Can I Say? The Music Says It All!! You cannot get a better collection of great recordings from such wonderful label. You will be searching long and hard. I have been collecting classical music for quite some time now and I have not come across a great deal such as this boxed set. Yes, I do have the DECCA Sound box, and the two 111 sets of Deutsche Grammophon. This by far is my favorite set. If you are thinking about starting a classical music library, this is a good place to start. It will introduce you to the finest music in world by some of the finest artists like: Alfred Brendel, Arthur Grumiaux, Sviatoslav Richter, Salvatore Accardo, Heinrich Schiff, Zoltan Kocsis, Sir Colin Davis, Simon Rattle, Antal Dorti, Bernard Haitink, Kurt Masur and so much more.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|What a way to end the trilogy! I can't wait to read the trilogy again....Suzanne Collins did an amazing job. It was a beautiful story. Sad but beautiful.
B008NABUU8|5.0|Not overly complicated to navigate through.  Easy to get theidea ofthe physics applied. Makes you start out with wood and won't let you overspan the supports or road.
B000002GVO|4.0|thank you very much....i still havent gotten this yet...i moved and my brother is holding it for me...i am sure it is perfect..thanks again
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I downloaded this version because I had already purchased it for the lower resolution DROID incredible. When i got a DROID RAZR, i opened the game only to find it stretched out, because it did not have widescreen. I remember the graphics being a lot better on my old  iPod touch 2nd generation, because it was not widescreen, and it was a different version anyway. It looks to me like this version has been abandoned by popcap, when all it needs is an update to fit widescreen phones like the RAZR or gs3.
1582406723|5.0|Since I love the walking dead and have been a fan ever since i seen the first episode i decided to get into the comic side of the waking dead. It is very cool and fun to read. A must have for any fan of the show and comics.
B0014JKJJI|3.0|these chinese made crocs are less like rubber and more like plastic than the other bistro crocs i bought before and they also seem to run a half size smaller than the ones i bought before.  definitely inferior to the mexican ones.  they're ok and i'll use them, but i doubt they will last as long.
B0018QQQK8|3.0|This book was excellent I have read it twice and probably would read it again I recommend this book to be read by most people that likes Nicholas sparks writing
B005K17RU0|4.0|She loves it, looks really good and is very accessable. Would recommend it to others as well.  Has sound of rain when rainining
B004ZMWUCU|3.0|Got it with a coupon for a buck. Seems like a tolerable story to read. In the middle of another book right now, but I've started on this one and it seems alright!
B008MG1E4A|4.0|It was good reading,  Think it provided better info than either the Government or media.  The movie was good, but this felt more factual
B00992CF6W|5.0|A awesome game and a lot of fun. It is better than any other game I know. Lots if updates.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My brother showed me this app and I loved it.I suggest this game for who ever likes dragons. The only thing is you have to have a lot of patience,because you have to earn money and wait for stuff to load.
B0084BMUFA|4.0|A greedy selfish, old coot....a night out with the ghosts..... reborn as the Christmas spirit incarnate.... still brings a tear to my eye
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love subway surfers its so much fun and addicting I hope you get it Yahoo!!!!!!!!!! I'm glade its free and not 99 cents I hope you like it as much as I like it
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's cool I love playing it everyday all day trust me I'm a valued customer who loves this game so......... GAME ON!
B00335EQ0E|5.0|Loved by my 3 year old. We have watched the movie over and over. It brings back memories from when I was a child.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I FREAKING LOVE THIS GAME YOU MUST DOWNLOAD!It's worth.the.space it uses.up on your phone It does not freeze.It's easy its free.Oh.gawd it's so good im snd addict
B0035WTE2U|5.0|This has all the AC/DC classics.  It is perfect for AC/DC fans.  If you like the music from the movie, you will love this CD.
B0034G4OYK|5.0|We originally saw this in the theater in 3D. All four of us loved it: my husband, my 7-yr old son, my 8-yr old daugter, and me.  We liked it enough to purchase the 3D Blu-ray to watch it at home.  It has been viewed several times since Christmas.  The kids love the characters and the story.  The 3D is neat but we enjoy it just as much in 2D because we like the story, the characters, and the humor.  I actually like it more now that I have seen it about 3 times.  Someone who panned this movie said it was written for the lowest common denominator.  As a card carrying member of Mensa, I assure you it appeals to high IQ people as well as everyone else.  I wouldn't encourage super young kids to watch this - then again some little kids like scary movies.  If your kids are OK with Monsters, Inc. they should be ok with this.  My daughter loves the \\"Zing\\" message.  I hope she carries it with her as she grows older.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is so fun but difficult. At times because of that darn officer and why does that dog stand in front of that truck. At  different times.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|I admit I am hard  to please when it comes to romance novels(Nora Roberts completely spoiled me). This book kept me reading. Very unique plot. Not overly sappy or prude. Perfectly balanced. Loved it!
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is the best game ever but it does make you use your mind but that's the best part if thevwhole game ya
B009B8YZKS|5.0|This movie, which was also a web series online had good cinematography and very good believable acting from the actors. The story-line was also really good.<br />Picture quality on blu-ray versus online was amazing. The detail they had into props and set was incredible. For just an online web series, they went above and beyond on making it. It also had some good special features.<br />Overall, I recommend Halo 4: Forward Unto Dawn.
B005LAJ212|5.0|i love this show, so i was very excited to be able to buy the first season. so far i am very pleased with this product.
B007ONSLLQ|5.0|The best American hard rock album I've heard in a long time. If you liked old GnR, LA Guns, and some of the other great hard rock outfits, you'll love this. The lead singer is one of the best in rock - tons of attitude and the pipes to back it up. The rest of the band is great too, memorable licks and tight songs. You'll be humming or singing along in no time. Standouts are \\"Daughters of Darkness\\" and \\"Freak like me\\".<br /><br />The only downside for me - though it comes with the territory and the songs are labeled \\"explicit\\" - is the amount of explicit language in some of the songs. Some of it is just too salty for my rock-lovin' kids, so they don't get this for their MP3 players...<br /><br />(Update: after I bought the explicit version, I saw that Amazon also has a \\"clean\\" version. I bought that, and indeed, all the foul language is silenced or replaced except \\"b**ch\\" in one or two songs - they even edited out \\"damn\\". So I really appreciate that Halestorm and Amazon make both available - my kids loved the couple of songs they heard so far and now I'm happy to let them listen to the whole thing.)
B007REV4T8|1.0|I couldn't wait to see this - previews looked good. While I watched it I started wondering when the movie would begin the typical Bond hijinks and excitement. All I saw was a whiny look at getting old.<br /><br />Watched it again to see if I missed something. Finally started skipping ahead to the very few exciting parts.<br /><br />Save money and time - don't waste your money on this crud
0345529057|5.0|Great books to read after you watched the HBO series. Goes into a little bit more detail. Difficult to read at times but well worth it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|If you want a true love story, here it is.  Love Nicholas Sparks.  As good as the notebook....maybe better. Thanks
B00B2V66VS|5.0|This temple run is so fun and addicting that I would play it for hours on my kindle fire! This game has more features to it than the first temple run and the meter gives powerhouse not just coins. There isn't as many characters though. There should be the invisibility power up too. Add the things that I said in the next update please!
B0091V6TJ0|5.0|Very good quality found Can Music.  3 Cds at a very good price.  Highly recommended for any Krautrock Lover or fan of experimental music
B009YP9L7U|3.0|I would recommend this book if you want a semi clean book I liked it alot, if u like the one that got away this one is some what similar

B008673ZAQ|5.0|I couldn't put it down once I started. The characters are so flawed deep inside, and the thin thread that holds them together is fraying.
0786838655|4.0|I happened to watch the movie first.  I never heared of the book before the I happened to rent the movie.  I really wanted to read the book after I watched the movie.  I have put off doing that for a while but I finally started reading the book while waiting at the store for my family for 3 hours.  The Lightning Thief started out slow, but it started to get really interesting when he got to camp.  The whole book has a different story line with added people that were not in the movie and excludes people that were in the movie (ex: Persephone, the Hydra, and Cerberus).  I loved when all the campers found out that Percy is the son of Poseidon and they all kneeled in front of him.  Loved how they showed more of a story on the campers at Camp Half-Blood, also love the addition of Ares, Dionysus, and Ares' children.  Love when Percy shows Clarisse up in the restroom in front of her cabin mates!!  Also the comments from Dionysus, aka Mr.D.  Can't wait for them to come back next summer and to read bout how school is for Percy now that he and others know what and who he is.
B00846REIS|5.0|I had to buy it for my tablet. I can't remeber ever reading the same book more than once...much less 3 times. It has become one of my couped up inside favorites to pass the day.
1423101499|4.0|I love this book. It gets more and more interesting as I keep on reading. I love the characters that came into this book. I was kind of skeptical about Daedelus, but I was hoping that he was in fact a good guy; and I'm glad he turned out to be one. I just knew that no one could be all bad if an animal liked him so much, even though it is a hellhound. I was really shocked when Poseidon came to their apartment while Paul was still there. My first reaction was that he has the worst timing ever and that he picked now of all times to come over and visit. My second thought was if Poseidon was getting possessive of Sally and if that was the reason why he came over. My final thought when Poseidon and Paul came face to face was - holy s***, Poseidon is here and Paul is still here. All in all, I love the drama that happened in this event filled book.
B004VRK436|5.0|an excellent movie for kids and the family.  The eight year old, his brother and mom love it, and so do I.  Would recommend it for all little boys who have brothers.
1423101502|4.0|I loved all the drama that was happening in this story. The action from the war happening between the titans and everyone else made me keep reading until I reached the last page. I was really sad with all the deaths, but I loved the romance that finally happened between two of the characters. I love the characters in this book. I cannot wait to read the other installments of the new series!
B00A77II0U|5.0|This game was SOOOOOO FUNNN!  Couldn't wait to get back to it each night!!!  Thanks for putting the time and effort into this one!
B00729GQ0A|3.0|First off, this is a good read.  It takes the by now tedious vampire inspired troubled romance genre and puts a much more creative spin on it without ever using the word &#34;Vampire&#34; &#34;Werewolves&#34; or the usual familiar terms other than &#34;Witch&#34; and largely manages to avoid its usual pitfalls in the process.  Ms Hamilton constructs her mythology by saying the Universe has a form of sentience and created Elementals to combat breaches of its design.  Her Earth Elementals are essentially Vampires, having to avoid daylight, feeding on blood and some other familiar tropes of the genre.  However she has 5 elements present and they each have a role to play that iplays off the Earth Elementals and their current state of being.  I don't want to go into too great of a detail because there's a fine line of tossing out spoilers and reviewing a work of fiction, part of a reader's enjoyment is letting the author describe their world to them in their words.<br /><br />Against this backdrop we have the developing romance of two lead characters, Sophia and Charles.  I'm not one for paranormal romance much, it tends to follow a formula that to be honest, I find annoying because of its standard tropes of how the hero and heroine come together through the labyrinth of their various forms of conflicts.  However, I did like it this time.  The reason is in a very large part to Ms Hamilton's use of language.  The book's style is lyrical, poetic in many areas with a absolutely beautiful use of adjectives and verbs to convey layers of information that put you right there and lets you see in lovely technicolor the subtle shades of emotion.  You get to see more than heaving bosoms or stern masterful jaws here (no disrespect to those who enjoy that sort of thing), the characters and their antagonists have a very real vibrancy thanks to Ms Hamilton's prose and the skill with which she wields it.  It is not easy to write in this fashion without falling prey to mushy prose.  It reminded me a lot of Ursula LeGuin's novels, that same gift for language was present that kept my interest engaged.  I should also add that the way Hamilton presents Sophia's Wiccan beliefs are both very well rooted in fact and I'd be quite surprised at any practicing Wiccan's having issue with how she presents Sophia's beliefs.  Sophia is very good blend of strong and vulnerable as is Charles, the characters have a very good chemistry that never strays to the sappy end.<br /><br />The only possible quibble I have with it when she starts to stray a bit towards the end by stating the Elementals have access to far superior technology and have for a long time because...well...they're Elementals.  This sort of thing is a pet peeve of mine and Hamilton's use of it is really minor, especially when one considers that she was able to take a reader who normally doesn't go for this genre and read the entire thing and consider it almost a 4 star book.  Why not 4 star?  Because like food, some things you like the taste of better and only for subjective reasons.  I'd venture to say that people who do like this genre in general, will find Hamilton's book at least a 4 if not 5 star book.eminded me a lot of Ursula LeGuin's novels, that same gift for language was present that kept my interest engaged.

B005LAIHSG|3.0|A good film pulls you into the story so well you don't notice the rough spots. Not so with this one. I was impressed with the set. But the film felt like a victim of the cutting room - a smooth flow was missing.<br />Enjoyed Stewart's efforts. Felt like they had Theron trying too hard at being evil. And due to the difficult flow, my subconscious kept kicking in former character casting: so it was good thing that Bella had Thor, Phillip and Smee along to help her.<br />I doubt I'll pull this DVD out and watch it again.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This book captured my attention immediately.  It has now become my all time favorite book.  As soon as I finished reading it, I had to turn around and re-read it again.<br /><br />The character Travis at first seems cool collected, funny, and a ladies man....until his world gets turned upside down by Abby.  They are both damaged in their own ways.<br /><br />The whole time Travis knows that they would be perfect together while Abby pushes him away.  Travis just reminds her of the life she was running from.  At times Travis' love seems almost unnerving....too intense.  Then other times it seems like the love any and all women wish we had in our live.<br /><br />Can't wait to read the next book.

B002CLBJPK|5.0|The movie is from disney.  Its is an enjoyable movie for all ages.  Excellent for children and adults alike.  A family movie
B008YKRRH2|5.0|The compelling virtues of Klemperer's Bruckner are his rethorical power, cold incisiveness, the brilliance and finesse of the orchestral playing and granitic approach confer him a special place in the Pantheon of the great Brucknerian conductors.<br /><br />His display of the tempos may be interesting. Of particular interest are his Fourth and Eighth Symphony, for instance. Fifth Symphony: I love the approach given by Carl Schuricht at the front of the Vienna Philharmonic in 1963, as well as the famous recording of F&uuml;rtwangler (from the late forties) among the great ones ; in what concerns the Sixth, I find in Horst Stein, Jascha Horenstein (in a live performance from 1963 with L.S.O.) and Georg Ludwig Jocum major contenders almost impossible to beat. The Seventh with Furtwangler, Szell- Vienna from Salzburg and a live recording with William Steinberg giving a knock-out performance and Los Angeles Philharmonic from 1970. The Ninth has in F&uacute;rtwangler, Giulini and Wand supreme readings hovered and conducted with red-blood flair.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I didn't doubt it for a second to purchase this set in terms of its historical importance.<br /><br />Absolutely recommended.
B0001WTVUW|5.0|This movie is not for kids,  Its tells what could happen if we released the missions on each other.  Lost of lives of loved ones and more violence.
0817439390|4.0|I give it a 41/2 as it is written in layman's language simple to understand not witten for those who already know
B003H9M1Q2|5.0|The movie is another great story that comes from my childhood from the time that disney was making for the whole family to watch.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book is such a good read. It feels so good after you read a good book and this book certainly kept me interested the entire time.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This Bible study app is the most comprehensive study guide that I have ever come across in my 63 years of life.  I can switch from translation to translation, have translations read to me, and much more.<br />I would have to say that it is for anyone who wants to learn more about the miracle of God, from those who want to find out who God is to the seasoned Bible scholar.<br />It is a real blessing to have this.

B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I really don't understand why this book has such a great rating... I mean, it is a decent book, but 5 starts, really? anyway... I know I am a bit picky and it takes a master piece to blow me away, but I really dont understand what the fuzz is all about! I have to confess that I recommended this book to all the young readers I know when I first started reading it (the first half does deserve at least 4 starts) but I was dessapointed in the end :(
B0013KTGAG|5.0|The movie stoped to much. It had to reload. I would rathar wait than watch it is pieces. Good movie though

B004MYF4SS|5.0|This is Book 1 of the Trilogy. The story is original and an entertaining one to boot. It is a beautifully written, descriptive tale of  policeman Fin MacLeod who is sent from Edinburgh back to the island of his birth to help with a murder investigation. Peter May paints such a vivid picture of the remote and rugged island of Lewis that I feel as though I have been there. This book certainly deserved 5 stars and I can't wait to start on Book 2.
B00AP9RQE4|4.0|This cosy, indulgent, amusing and mildly exciting volume (just like Ivan) in the Vor universe was very satisfying. Bujold is very clever. I am a little in awe by how transported I was from my surroundings by the story. The characters stayed consistently in character so that I was never jolted back to awareness of my role as a reader; Barrayar, the locations, rooms, buildings, tunnels (oops...bit of a spoiler there, sorry) were vividly painted; I was *there*, not merely reading about it. I am not sure if the experience would be so convincing for those readers who hadn't already had the foundational experience of having read the many Vor novels that have gone before.<br /><br />This adventure is not as nailbitingly gripping as the early Miles novels. Its tone is more comfortable and easy going, more like the latter Miles novels. It reassures us that our old friends and planets are all still there, continuing on their own paths, growing, not cryofrozen nor gone stale in the literary universe. The humour is affectionate and knowing. The excitement (yes, there is excitement) is mined from the deep and fertile veins of corrupt, paranoid, conflict-ridden Barraryaran history. I recommend it, but (sorry, there is a but) if you're new to this universe, first start with Bujold's \\"Young Miles\\" compilation or maybe even go back as far as \\"Shards of Honour\\".
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|The connection between Sky and Holder is inspiring!  I laughed, cried and sighed!...<br />Can't wait for Colleen Hoover's next story!

B001N1DPDE|5.0|I recently returned/exchanged a Gerber LMF 2 for this knife because of the sturdy construction and build quality this awesome product represents. With the ability to modify the look and feel of this knife, I feel it's the best value for the money. Great collaboration between Ethan Becker & Ka Bar! If you feel the need to baton with this knife, I'm positive you won't have any problems. However, it's ideal to chop wood with an ax. Most junior Youtube survivor enthusiasts will try to baton with knives that just aren't built for the task I.E. (The Ka Bar USMC fighting knife) then get mad because their knife broke. If you're thinking about getting this knife then go for it! You won't be disappointed! Awesome customer service as always from Amazon.
B005OL9EEI|5.0|Not sure why some people gave it the criticism that it got.  If you were a true fan of the original series, Space Battle Yamato or the American version, Starblazers, you have to know they were some vital differences between the two.  Also there were different story arcs to the series.  I do have to admit they omitted  1/3 of the series from the film, but I didn't care.  The ending was close to accurate if you watch the entire Yamato series.  I thought the Japanese did an excellent job translating to live action.  It is very hard to convert an anime series to live action.  I was very dissappointed what the Wachhowski Brothers did with Speed Racer.  But Space Battleship Yamato was a successful translation.
B009FZFONO|5.0|If you love the Apocalyptic, then this is for you. Proudly made in Georgia and gaining momentum, this acclaimed series has re-sparked interest into a cult classic genre that was shelved to soon in the eighties.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|love it. Do you love it to? because I think it is great for me and my family and you
B005RUV0NY|5.0|If you haven't seen TWD, do yourself a favor and watch it now! Ground breaking in execution and will leave you wanting more!
B000001GQR|4.0|I may agree with at least one other reviewer who thinks that the surprise star of this release is the Haydn rather than the Schubert, not that the latter isn't performed with excellence. Despite some criticisms by others here, I find Furtwanger's rendition with the Berlin Philharmonic quite expressive and personal without approaching the top, let alone going over it. The transition in the first movement mentioned by another reviewer may happen a bit too urgently, but that's a short stretch in a work that's nearly an hour long, and most of that hour is just wonderful. My main problem is with the sound, which I find a bit dull. Perhaps that's related to the fact that it's a mono recording; I don't know. In any case, on the basis of performance alone this ranks among the top in my book, which for modern instrument renditions includes those by Szell, Bohm, Klemperer and Bernstein -- the latter perhaps a dark horse in the eyes of some. Furtwangler's version has more humanity than any of them, except I think for Bernstein's. But on to the Haydn, which comes off relatively better when it comes to the issue of sound quality. This performance is smooth to the hilt, with suave and quiet wit from start to finish. As another reviewer noted, single performances of this work are not that common, and it's a treat to hear it from an old style big band but with a lightness that never flags. If it weren't for the sound, I'd give this five stars, but since the recordings are more than 60 years old, perhaps I should be grateful for what I can hear. Recommended.
0316077046|3.0|I really want to like this series, I really do. I know so many that love it but for whatever reason after the first book, I was really disappointed. I just couldn't get into it.<br /><br />So why did I give the second book a chance? Because I kept thinking, if so many people that I trust, love this series, I must have overlooked something right? Right?<br /><br /> I will say this for the series, the authors know how to paint a setting. I felt the town. I smelled the smells and tasted the air. I could feel the darkness that was never far away and the light that tried to shine through it all.<br /><br />Yet despite the beautiful details of the town, I can't help but feel like the plot is no different than something that has been done before. The same plot of a supernatural falling in love with a mortal. Star crossed lovers destined to be separated but still fighting for their love. And just when they think they might have made it, the sup pulls away for the benefit of the one she loves. And the battle begins again.<br /><br />This started out with such a dark sad feeling. Understandable I guess considering it starts with a funeral of a loved one but the storyline never really shook that initial bleak feeling from the rest of the plot.<br /><br />I felt a little melancholy while reading this.<br /><br />I did love Ethan more after reading this so I am thankful for that. Unfortunately, it also meant I decided I didn't love Lena as much as I did in the first. She just gave up. Where was the fighter from the first book?<br /><br />I really wish I could say this was the series for me but the truth of the matter is, I just can't get into it. I think this is the end of the road for me and the Caster Chronicles.
B0084I9QI2|5.0|Beyond my expectations!  The new material is so good!  Abortion Papers, aka Song Groove, takes a controversial theme and makes you want to dance to it.  Who does that?  I'm So Blue reveals Michael's beautiful, soulful voice and I just love, Free.  Street-Walker has a groovy, 'wanna boogie' beat and the Price of Fame is hauntingly telling.  Part of me questions whether Sony is doing the right thing by finishing Michael's unreleased material.  He was such a perfectionist and lots of his songs were written years before he released them.  He'd just continue to revisit them until the time was right and he was reasonably comfortable with the song and it's relevance to the time he planned to release it.  But, it would be a darn shame to keep his magnficent creations in the vault and never release them.  I'm sure he'd understand the reasoning behind it.  Afterall, it's for his fans and he loved them as no entertainer ever loved his fans.  Hopefully, future releases will include Blue Gangsta, Do You Know Where Your Children Are (just a killer song!), Shout and She Got It (so funky!), and, of course, that beautiful anthem he sang at a fund-raising concert for 9-11--What More Can I Give.  I'm contemplating buying the vinyl even though I don't have anything to play it on.  When I listen to his music, I am reminded just how fortunate I was to experience such an astoundingly talented human being.  Like a comet blazing 'cross the evening sky, gone too soon!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this is good. I do like the problem solving.. nearly impossible without the hints though.  An escape game and no pressure with time or having to start all over if you do not succeed.  would like if it was truely free

B000025H0Q|5.0|Nick Drake is great, but I think this is his best work.  It's pretty varied, both in emotion (from sad to happy, etc), and in style (some pop-y, some more jazz-y or folk-y).  It's basically the \\"Empire Strikes Back\\" of the Nick Drake studio album trilogy.

0316228532|1.0|Two thumbs down. I am so disappointed in this book. After reading her Harry Potter series, this was a huge boring waste of time and money. Normally I love dry British humor and drama, but this left me dumbfounded.  I understand this was to be nothing like the Harry Potter series, I read most of the books in the top 100 best selling books lists  and I read the write ups so I wasn't expecting a fantasy book. Rowling wrote so beautifully before with such imagination that I was expecting this work to be good, or at least slightly interesting. I now believe I have read instruction manuals and ancient ship manifests that were more entertaining than this read. Must be when they say it is a novel for adults, they meant It's a bedtime story due to the fact that  in 30 minutes you'll be snoring.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|This was an easy read and another education on the mythologies of ancient Rome and Greece.  This is a great series for middle school to YA readers or for light reading for adults.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This is one of the best Nicholas Sparks book I have ever read. Love the twist of love and suspense.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I am very disappointed. I was going to use this in my MDX, does not fit into any of the ports!!
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This is definitely a book I will reread time and time again. It addresses topics that aren't often breached in the \\"coming-of-age classics\\" that are so popular with the younger generation, like introversion and how you can be there and not quite there at the same time. As someone who relates deeply to Charlie, this novel provided some helpful insights on my current situation. I highly recommend this book; please read it. It won't be what you think.
B000002OR4|5.0|A beautiful piece; sad but necessary to remember these  horrors committed by &#34;men&#34; on other human beings. I enjoy the music, but have images of the poor souls who were tortured and killed
B009CPJHY4|4.0|Delightful story that reminds us that life is nor over until it is over. There is live after living what is expected
B007G8SET8|5.0|Exactly what it was described as, music selection is great, over 30 songs, different shows, so you know its real, not some re-hash of overproduced or fake video...live and loud! Saxon continues to rock 30 years later...
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is great.You can get alot of new and different charecters.Even sometimes the scenes of the game may change.When the scenes change there's also a new limited edition charecter!When you try to get tchhe limited edition charecter be careful it might cost you 95000 coins or dollars but don't worry its the ngame money.But other than that the game is awesome.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Very fast paced and held my attention. Very exciting, I never got bored. I highly recommend this book as a good read.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|Bought this to play with my kids but the range and accuracy is horrible. Darts would only go about 18'-20' even with the barrel off and the Elite darts. My kids have the Maverick and that shoots almost twice as far and is much more accurate. Took it apart to drill out the air restrictor and stretch out the spring. Probably getting about 35'-40' with the Elite darts now. I have also yet to experience any jamming both before and after modding it.
B0060ZJ7BC|5.0|Great price for the product and arrived quickly. I was a little hesitant when I received the movie and it was not in a sealed package like most &#34;New&#34; movies are, but besides that everything was great. Movie played without any problems. I would definitely buy from this seller again!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|this game is normally fun but a couple times when I have tried to open it, it force closes and I have to uninstall then reinstall it.
B003IKMR0U|5.0|This is a great, quick game to play with family and/or friends. This is also a very easy game to pick up and teach other people. I highly recommend this fun little game.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|I am happy that there is a calculator that can be easy to use and the best part that I love about this calculator is that if you mess up you can go back and start over and will not loss what you had put in the calculator thanks again good app
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a good app to buy. Being 13 I would know! It is very entertaining and has good quality graphics. There are some advertisements when you first enter the game. Other than that it is a wonderful app!
B008YWY0HK|1.0|The story was quite interesting and was very entertaining up to the point of the result of visiting the old crone in the forest. Story went pretty much downhill from there. Animation was definately very well done, but they need a new screenwriter. The storyline and moral implications were ok, just not the way the screenwriter presented them.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|Pros:  This app has great graphics, New additions(like the zipline and the mining cart), big and traditional monster AKA the man-eating monkey, hills and streams and sunlight make it realistic too. It has some major up upgrades from the original temple run that make the whole game completely new and different.<br /><br />Cons: Its glitchy and when you want to jump it turns instead. The whole app is confusing at first with its new layout and its hard to decide when you need to turn. Also the slide is a shorter period so if you are like me and slide a little early then you will likely die.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this app. Its addictive and exciting but also needs some getting use to and patience.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is amazing and im glad that i got the 2 just because its free and so fun! I definately recommend this game especially if you like Mario Bros!
1401937519|5.0|This book is exceptionally uplifting, thought provoking and startling. It gave me a new perspective on who I am, the power I have and the meaning of my life. As a woman with, what some might label, a terminal illness, I found in this book the means with which I can seek my own healing; there is no formula for this, only the realization of who I am.
B00AJLHUAS|4.0|The Orchestra sounds great & nostalgic. Transport yourself in an era we can only imagine now, Tuxedos, Champagne and burlesque! Now we need is a tour! Well worth the money. Great CD & packaging. Way to go BF.
0312330537|5.0|Quite possibly one of the best novels I have ever read. I had heard a lot about this book before I ever read it and was looking forward to reading it but it was so lengthy that it seemed an insurmountable task but I finally succumbed to it and it left me speed reading. I mean I couldn't put this book down. The story which I read as true was amazing and the way the writer crafts and weaves and creates the story really brings it to life and all the exoticness of India comes through. This is the type of book where you can feel the story and the emotions of the characters. For the time I was reading it I was totally in their world. For me this novel was a complete escape from reality and that is what every good book should aim to accomplish. I was in India with the characters and I was living their lives through the words on the pages. Really an amazing story. The back story of the author is even more amazing and that is why I read this book as non-fiction because all the elements of the writer's true life story are in this book. Who is to say what is real and what is not? Not me by any means. But definitely check this book out. Like I said it is one of the best novels I have ever read and this story should be made into a movie if it hasn't been already.

B0054JZC6E|5.0|These games are realy fun.<br />Just get these games no buts about it just get these games.<br /><br />JUST GET THEM.
B005LZW8FO|5.0|Now one of my favorites. Solid writing, storytelling that is accentuated by Brit's outstanding performance. Mapother also does well but seems to be over-acting at a point or two. The ending, which is both subtle and remarkable, was brilliantly photographed. The overall premise is a bit much but the movie, as a whole, is remarkable.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I use this app daily and love every aspect. pinterest is addicting and anyone who doesn't have an account should create one. especially if you're getting married in the near future!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is better than temple run its just to good & it's fun especially when you start moving fast the higher your score the faster you move
B003NHRIVQ|3.0|This was a Christmas gift to a young lady and she says she watches it all the time.She says she loves the movie.
B001I45UFC|5.0|Great book wish I had read it sooner.  Great ideas and story too I recommend it to anyone who likes a good book
0749936606|4.0|Oh, I do love the Bridgerton Family! Each story is a wonderful romance with plenty of drama. A nice touch of steam to keep things naughty! Love this whole series and the epilogues!! And that Lady Whistledown is a hoot!! Such wonderfully engaging characters! Makes me wish I could be transported to that era!
B00004WG2F|5.0|timely service<br />I would definitely do business again<br />Good product, good shape<br />As described, easy to order<br />fair prices<br />thankyou
B00B2V66VS|4.0|This game is much better quality wise than the first. The only thing I do not like is that after I close out of the game, it will not allow me to continue the game when I try to reload it.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|You need lower prices for people! But other than that the game is poupular and awesome! I think that the trains well going on top of them is awesome!
B007ZGBZHE|5.0|Any time a Pendergast book is available, time stops for me!!!  I'm sure it will for you too.  Enjoy enjoy
B00BESM14U|5.0|I have not read the book yet but the film was fantastic. The movie has its ups and its downs and presents you with the ability to feel the characters emotions. I am not big on this kind of film but it turned out to be well done.
B003PIUBYY|5.0|Excellent transaction! The product was as good as advertised as well. I'm grooving to my new Super Fly soundtrack as we speak.
B00B3MN65K|5.0|The songs on this album are wonderful and inspiring.  The first track is my absolute favorite new song.  I hum it all the time which is probably annoying my co-workers.
B008RA3X5E|1.0|I used this alarm clock for about a month. I loved being able to wake up to my own music, but there are a couple of  features I didn't like. The biggest problem, and why I deleted this app, is because if your Kindle is on mute, the alarm will not go off!! This happened to me twice. The other issue is the small snooze button. The &quot;dismiss&quot; button was WAY bigger, and I accidentally hit dismiss instead of snooze more than once.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Her songs speak to the soul.  I never tire of listening to her voice.  She has such style and dimension.
B0052AC8C6|2.0|Not only is the language above what most adults can comprehend these days, (which I enjoyed), kids will not be able to follow along. It also has inappropriate language which some parents will not want their children to hear. The plot was your usual chump becomes hero, anti-establishment, environmentalist, religious parody...unfortunately. It was interesting and it had its moments, but I wouldn't say I'd go buy it...or watch it for free again.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|The songs were varied in the theme of Christmas.  Packaged min a substantial cardboard CD cover.  The cover was aesthetically beautiful.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book really kept my attention. I love Holder! My sister-in-law Ashley Coatney recommended Hopeless to me! I can not wait to read Colleen Hoover's other books! Slammed was awesome too! :)
1451695187|5.0|Oh, my ... Dr. Alexander is a friend, and  I twice have heard him speak; his book is even better than I expected --- beautifully organized &#34;stortelling.&#34; Affirmation of much I already knew by faith.
1463707606|4.0|This book has some very good ideas. A lot of the projects I've seen in Meenakshi Mukerji's other books. They are beautiful projects, but this book is not as high a quality as the other books. The instructions are easy to read but not too many photos, or just black & white photos - color makes a world of difference.<br /><br />This author has some very good ideas, if you have all of the other books by this author, then you don't necessarily need to buy this one. Although, this is a very good buy for the price.
B001GKJ2FM|5.0|A feel good movie made even better by gorgeous scenery and actors, especially Streep, who have moved out of the box.
B002ZG9774|5.0|When I played this movie on my new blue ray player the sound quality and cinematography is superb.  Love it.
1594484813|4.0|The world is filled with strange people, and this is a fascinating tale of only one of them. I am a bookaholic myself but I never ocnsidered ste4aling them!
B0044XV3R8|5.0|This has got to be one of my favorite movies of all time and enjoying it in this media.  I will watch this many times.
B00AVTMCYW|3.0|I thought I was watching an 80s teen flick. I never read the acclaimed novel upon which this is based, but I wasn't particularly enthralled with the coming-of-age story line. What is the time setting of this film? 80s? 90s? Today? Seemed unclear, but the music soundtrack would seem to indicate 80s. Yet, the sets or clothing or hairstyles do not say 80s. That was confusing. The plot, such as it is, revolves around a timid freshman who is depressed about something involving his aunt. Hmmm, who died in a car crash. He hangs out with wallflowers: gays, unattractive girls etc., and joins the \\"Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" cast. In the end, he resolves his identity, gets the girl and life marches on. Watch if you liked \\"Pretty in Pink.\\"
B008JGSM6G|5.0|this is a very fun and addicting game. try it. you will not be disappointed. it works great and so much fun. hurry and get it before its not free. it is a very popular game. I even had to delete it because it was so addicting
B007REV4YI|3.0|Spoilers ahead<br /><br />If you shut off your brain (including your memory of previous Bond movies) for 2hrs 23min, you'll enjoy this.  Otherwise, this is what will bother you:<br /><br />1) Unexplained, unfinished plot points:<br />  a) During the first twenty minutes or so of the movie, Bond is shot and falls way down into a body of water. He is unconscious. We never see him saved, but somehow, after the song and credits, he's on a beach with a woman.  How did he survive? We never find out.<br /><br />  b) He comes back to England because someone has stolen a computerized list of undercover agents and plans to reveal five names each week, thereby putting the nation's security at risk (not to mention those agents).  About halfway through the movie, though, the main conflict involves M and her life being in danger from a madman. What happened to plotline about the list? That is never brought up again or explained.  I guess we're to assume that the death of the bad guy did away with all that, but that's a pretty big assumption.<br /><br />2) A Bond girl who dies within a few minutes of her initial appearance in the movie. What's the point?<br /><br />3) A less debonair, less suave Bond---Craig plays the character as too flawed. I know that the script writers are only going with the times (where we seem to relish flawed heroes), but one of the best things about the Bond character is the larger-than-life persona.  He is capable, above all. Craig's Bond is losing his ability to shoot, doesn't pass the \\"spy\\" test, and M gets killed on his watch.<br /><br />4)Overly sentimental -- Can we please get back to a basic spy story (i.e., Bond gets a mission from M, goes on said mission, encounters eccentric villain & gorgeous women, saves England/the world from the bad guys)?  Why must Craig's Bond movies always delve into his past?  How typical of this \\"it's-all-about-me\\" generation.  Stop the navel-gazing already!<br /><br />5) Timeline is off --I appreciate the nod to past Bond movies with the Aston Martin, but how can that be regarded in the movie as a relic from the past when, according to the movie, Moneypenny has just become the new M's assistant?<br /><br />6) I'm still scratching my head over the scene in which Bond meets the villain. What was the purpose of the villain trying to come onto Bond? Was it to make Bond nervous? And why would Bond reply as he does? That was just stupid.
B000002UWG|4.0|Louis Prima meets all of my expectations.  Happy sound.  Solid Jazz..  You felt like singing along with him and the band members, including Keely Smith.
1451695195|5.0|I read this book in two days and bought 10 copies so I could give one to each of my children and those closest to me. It reaffirmed some things I already believed and clarified some others. It helped me grow spiritually.
B005LAIH4A|5.0|I really enjoyed the movie in the theaters and I thought it was a good movie to hv for a road trip.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|Should be required reading for American students who are given so much and expect more. William's insights are humorous at times and thought provoking.
0446580848|5.0|One of the best action novel characters ever! I hope this really isn't the final book in the series! It's John Corey and Kate Mayfield at their very best. Good cross over with DeMilles other books and delivers all the heart stopping moments the other Corey books did.
B003O86FMW|3.0|Admittedly Catniss has been thru a terrible ordeal but Book 2 makes her into a real whiner who only thinks about herself and her feelings. I wonder how the movie will portray her?
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|THE WALKING DEAD ROCKS! I don't care who you are or if you love zombies or not. This show is much more than zombies! Watching it in blu ray is one hell of a treat.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This is an awesome app! It's great for productivity! I hats writing reviews and I will never write another one (okay never say never) but I owe so much of my productivity to this one application, I couldn't say no when prompted.
B007SGM084|5.0|Very good interesting story. Loved all of it. This is something I will read again. Love how it ended. Don't leave me wondering what happen.
B001FB4VY4|5.0|one of my favorite shows on tv and now they released all the seasons on blu-ray makes me happy. just a great show
B000002C2E|5.0|the man has had a very long career and still making music.that ought to tell you something about this singer.he is just plain awesome and never disapoints.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|one of my favorite shows on tv and now they released all the seasons on blu-ray makes me happy. just a great show
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's really good .you can jump on trains and stuff it's a good game.everyone should play it. You also do missions and daily challenges.
B009LRE040|4.0|The Dark Knight Rises is a good movie. It isn't mindblowingly awesome, but it is a good, solid movie. I would recommend this.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|All I can say is these books Rock and whoever gives this a one star is a total idiot and I mean it
B00BB8UTEC|1.0|We rented this for Valentines Day= What a disappointment!  It went from one depressing scene to another.  Don't be fooled by the trailer!
B003JTHXOK|5.0|The book is very heart warming and filled with emotion. Someone somewhere can probably relate to instances in the selection. I would hi highly recommend!
B0098VY2AG|5.0|It seems that some people cannot criticize the show w.out reference to the display of penises.  Gentlemen, this is set thousands of years ago.  Life was short and brutal for many and they did not get caught up on the same mores as today. (For example, in the first show Solonius stops in the middle of the street and defacates at a public toilet right next to the man that he'd been conversing with.  If I recall, the attendant wiped his arse for coin!) Also, if you look around, there are more displays of breasts because there's an equal number of leading women and hand maidens. Are you so blind that you cannot see the areola beneath the women's shear dresses?  In sum, wether you favor women or men, there is plenty to enjoy.  And unless you are dimwit, that is what the writers meant to do, in addition to following some historical guidance.  FWIW, I hear that in Roman times the phallus was a powerful symbol.  Even in HBOs 'Rome' households and street walls had statues and graffiti (a word from that period) of penises.  In sum, sort out your facts or just do not watch the show.  Lastly, Andy Whitfield passed away, and filling his shoes is no easy matter. Mr. McIntyre carries the character and the dialogue very well. (I wish that Naevia's character were played by the same actress, but in real life people get other gigs and if you do a little googling, you find that to be the case.  Everyone has to pay rent and mortgage, no?)
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|Several years ago I realized that sales was something everyone in my organization was responsible for producing. I eliminated commissions and spread that comp to the rest of the staff. My &#34;gut&#34; said it was the right thing to do; Dan Pink has now articulated my instinct -- plus a whole lot more. This book will become required reading for everyone in the organization. Thank you, Dan!
B005NFW0U0|5.0|I love the vampire diaries series! This is one of the main reasons I watch tv if it wasn't for this show I'd throw my tv out the window :) lol
B0072KZ0Z6|5.0|Shut up, Zooey, don't talk anymore, just bat your eyelashes.<br /><br />I'll give Zooey a dozen TV and movie awards if she can just change her hair-style every now and then, try on a new wardrobe, roll her gorgeous eyes more often, smile and make funny sounds on screen..... no words need to be spoken.<br /><br />I watch this series because I like watching Zooey Deschanel.
B003ESKXGG|5.0|We looked at the watches while we were in Switzerland in September so this was a nice holiday gift and trip souvenir!
B0002OERI0|5.0|Love their &#34;modern opera&#34;!  Green Day rocks the house!  Makes me want to see their stage play to hear it live.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Awesome game for passing the time if you`re bored or just killing time. Love it! Good at holding interest and lots of fun! :)
B004EBT5CU|5.0|A great studio album -- There isn't a bad song in the list.  Makes me want to order more of her CDs
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love this app. It comes in handy when your battery is low it shows exactly how much time you have remaining for many different activities. I also like the nice  colorful battery widget. It works great on my kindle. I would recommend this app.
B008XG1X18|5.0|I've been addicted to Pinterest since it began.<br />Having this app makes me all warm and fuzzy inside<br />and helps me browse and drool with ease on my smart fone.<br /><br />If you're a Pinner....Get It!<br />If you've never been on Pinterest....Get It!<br />But don't hold me responsible for the lost time<br />you'll spend on this site!  lol
0553801473|5.0|If all you want is for the plot to move along, you might be disappointed in this volume. There's a lot of setting up for the last two books going on in this one.<br /><br />But if you enjoy the rich history of the world Martin has created, and if you like to soak in every detail, try to make connections and predict what will happen next, and simply delve deeper into the minds of the main characters, this is a wonderful addition to the series.<br /><br />Of course, if you're invested this far into the series, this will be essential reading anyway. I thoroughly enjoyed it and am eagerly awaiting the next installment.
B009UX2YAC|2.0|I had over 300,000 coins and I left the game and then came back and I lost all of them! I had almost all the charactors and hoverboards and now I have to start all over again!
B008XG1X18|5.0|Pinterest is a great way to share ideas with others who have the same or similar interests.<br />My favorite thing to do is save recipes & home ideas....I've been clipping & saving recipes & magazine articles for over 30 years & now with a quick &#34;pin it&#34; click, I can direct an item to a specific board & am able to retrieve it later when I may need it.
B00129I5SM|1.0|DVD did not play nor was the beginning in English. You get what you pay for, I payed for crap and I got crap.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I really enjoy this game. It's a good way to relax and still challenges you. You can choose both picture and number of pieces depending on how difficult you'd like it to be.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|The Lep's world games are crisp platformers with high quality graphics. I played the first game about a year ago, I enjoyed it so much I beat it twice! So I was delighted to see a sequel had been released. I'm 3 levels in and still loving the core elements and I love the improvements to gameplay and sountrack! This is a fantastic choice for people who wish they could play Mario games on the kindle fire! AND IT'S FREE!!
030746363X|5.0|I heard Tim on a podcast and decided to pick up the book. This book isn't anything like those tired fitness books or tips and tricks from runners world or men's health. Guaranteed 80% of the info in this book you've never heard of or considered but its presented in an easy to digest manner and the science is there to back it up if you're interested in reading that as well. If you enjoy this at all absolutely buy 4 hour Chef.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesome book. Great plot that really gets your blood pumping and draws you into the story. If recommend this to just about any one who loves to read.
B00AY7Q01C|5.0|What an amazing story. It still seems like a fairytale, it's so hard to believe that this is a documentary. Having been born in South Africa in the midst of apartheid, and emigrating to the states, this movie brings an incredible perspective to me on so many levels, most profoundly: class inequality, social justice, art and industry, and the cruel irony that life often brings. How many more artists are in our midst with such powerful messages we will never hear? Most of all, this movie portrays Sixto Rodriguez with such humility and soul. Inspiring.
B004L49K2A|5.0|No need to say anything about this fantastic CD from one of the best Brits bands of all times. Duran Duran is a reference in music worldwide. Don't miss this out.
B001KWN6ZS|5.0|great album some of Clapton's best in an acoustic setting.  i'd watched the you tube videos and the sound on the album is excellent, actually better than the video.
0812993357|5.0|I am quite excited to start this book. At the moment I'm finishing Anna Karina.Was happy to find it on Amazon with a quick delivery at such a great price. She is one of my favorites of the Vogue Staff.
1609611543|5.0|Getting to the point of purchasing this book was a process for me!  That being said, I've been actually doing the Wheat Belly diet for 3 weeks now and already see super results!!  My glucose (pokes) that I do daily are below 100, I'm losing weight and wearing clothes that I wasn't able to get into a month and more ago.  I can say now that I wish I'd purchased it sooner than I did!<br /><br />The book, itself is used and came just as the seller said in their summary.  It also came in a timely manner.  I purchase nearly all my books from Amazon as they're come through really well for me.
1932735410|5.0|This book is a well written, results driven study guide with plenty of practical exercises, illustrations, and examples to help prepare you for the PMI PMP examination and certification.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|Tis was a great book. Similar in some ways to Fifty Shades, but not quiet as graphic, and no &#34;red room&#34;.
B00A3NQNUU|4.0|I loooove this game but I want to buy gems,they r way to expensive I went to go spend 5 dollars on gems thinking I would get like 250 but u only get 130!!! Make it cheaper!!!
B006GECE9Y|4.0|...very handy browser. I like the design. Sure wish I could access my Lotus Notes, though. The only reason I couldn't give it 5 stars - not compatible with Lotus Notes on the web.(webnotes)
B004QX07G4|5.0|I enjoyed this because it was just like listening to her. She's so funny and unique. I've never watched her daytime show because I work full-time, but take every opportunity to watch her perform, starting with the Tonight Show and her sitcom, which I thought was hilarious. I love her kindness and humor so much.
B0067RQYNW|5.0|...has features I use a lot = less work when I get ready to update data collected in the field...
B007REV4YI|5.0|If you're a James Bond fan, this is awesome. If you're not - who knows? It's a great movie. I'll watch just about anything with Daniel Craig and Judi Dench - together they are a home run for me.
B001TH16DI|5.0|Shipped on time, packaging great, everything went smoothly. I just wish they would have been the director's cuts and special longer versions of the films.
B00A8SPNYW|3.0|It's clever and fun, but I got to a spot where I spent several days trying to get past it and decided it wasn't worth any more of my time, so I deleted it.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Battery HD covers most of the needs of the Kindle Fire HD.  The calibration feature really works well.  I am so glad to have found this app.<br /><br />On another note, I've read the handful of complaints from Kindle users. Some of them sound like they are installing the app on non-HD units.  Make certain that the Kindle is a compatible model.  If you email the developer, you might be able to acquire a non-HD version.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I have tried many alarm clocks where you can just hit snooze only for it not to go off again. This one makes you open you eyes to see the off button otherwise it just keeps going
B007SY3CEW|4.0|Fun and easy to use, very entertaining and teaches young children to understand how piano keyboard works.  Young and old can play the game without difficulty.
B007THA4FI|2.0|Can hardly believe it is the same person who wrote Harry Potter.  A group of sad people in a small English town and when all is said and done, no one is better off in the end.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book because it was strongly recommended by a family member whose opinion I trust.  I was pleasantly surprised by how enthralled I became at the onset of the games. I literally could not put it down. It was a great read.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|Both my husband and I have finished reading this great story.  We are somewhat  familiar with the Pacific Crest Trail, as we live about 1 1/2 hrs from it.  Loved Strayed's descriptions of hardships and determination of her treck.  We have visited many of the small towns and camps in northern California and Oregon.  Could hardly put it down!  Would definitely suggest this awesome read.  Thank you, Cheryl Strayed
B0083Z614S|4.0|It's uplifting and inspiring. It's clean written and could be a good book for older children to read. Good book.
B004GJDQT8|5.0|This is App is very helpful with my Samsung Galaxy S III.  Make working on amazon a breeze.  Very helpful.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|This was a very exciting book.  I could hardly put it down.  A real page turner all the way through.
B000Z8GZYW|5.0|This is one of most favorite movies.  We love to watch this movie often.  On groundhog day we watch it over and over.  Bill Muray is a great actor.  This is a classic.  If you don't own, try it.  You might like to watch it day after day after day after day.  Over and over!!!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|One of my favorite books from my childhood and a great book to read as an adult. I love this book!
B0054JELS4|5.0|This TV series is great, if not the best on TV.  We love watching it over and over.  Great story lines and great actors and characters.  You'll love this series.  Great to watch when the power goes out and the cable is down.  Can't say enough good things.  Buy it, you'll love it too.
B001992NW4|5.0|Stupidly, I sold my copy last summer not realizing it was going out of print.  Had I known that I never would have let it out of my sight.  I recently re-purchased it for a price that was higher than what I wanted, but at least I have it.  This version has it all, including more stuff that hasn't been in previous DVD versions.  For the serious collector and the serious FAN.
B002MQYOFW|1.0|I bought this book and read it just to see what the hype was all about... doing so lessened my faith in humanity somewhat.<br /><br />It's not a good book.  It is written in a witty and modern style that moves super quickly, kinda like the TV Commercial version of a novel.  I hope this isn't the future of writing...<br /><br />Yes, it had me turning the pages really quick, and could be hard to put down at times.  The author does a lot of technical things very right.<br /><br />But at the end of the day, the main character is annoying at best and simply not believable at worst.  And not just the the main character, but most every character behaved in a way that just didn't seem believable.  They behaved in a way that advanced the plot very well, but not how you'd expect real people to behave.  I grew to dislike almost every character because of it.  And I also found myself shaking my head and facepalming throughout.<br /><br />(and yes, I know it's for a younger audience, but so was Harry Potter and many other excellent books... that's no excuse)
B008XM3NZQ|5.0|Forget the other versions, get this one.  It is the best presentation of this film since it was first released.
B0093ICOJ0|5.0|...not Wayne this time ...but Timm! He is an expert on Batman - knows him to the core.... showed it times and times already - but with this latest entries - Year One, Under the Red Hood, and DARK KNIGHT RETURNS - he did something even harder - he surpassed himself ( to surpass Nolan was not an acheivement of any kind) - and faboulous Batman:TAS series. So many years after Legends of the Dark Knight entry in TAS - when we were left wishing if someone will ever do complete animated feature of Dark knight Returns - Bruce delivered, and delivered good. Thank you Bruce!
B0076DCT2G|5.0|It was compelling. Enjoyed every wisecrack. Johne Corey and Kate Mayfield are great characters. I'm hoping to read more of their stories.
B005I64U66|5.0|Wo hasn't had a wayward thought about an irritating boss at one time or another. This movie sure takes the bite out of your anger.thank you.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|This is a touching book that stays with me after its over. I really liked the characters, but I wish it wasn't so sad. It is written with a quick wit that both made me laugh and think deeply about what was said. I've never read a book like this and I'm glad that I did.
B008WCP2KG|5.0|This movie is hot, hot, hot! I look forward to ordering from you again in the future. This was worth the wait.
B00A9X9TIW|5.0|Fantastic.  I almost never give five stars.  If you think this film is just another action film with Bruce Willis, you are wrong.  This is much more.  Fantastic characters.  Great acting, mostly by Bruce's younger self, Joseph Gordon-Levitt.  About a man who found himself, saved a boy, and probably the future.  You'll never expect it.  Enjoy.
B00A9T1HUO|5.0|As always Josh Groban turns out fantastic music. If you are a fan you will live it too. Thumbs up
B007KDFWRG|3.0|It was a well-done live recording. I like the musicians. But the jazzy stuff, and the religious stuff are not my cup of tea. Also, I like a tasteful dose of slide guitar, but Derek tends to use too much of it.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|THIS GAME ROCKS!!!!!!! It's like Temple Run but even cooler.  Every body should get this app! It also has waayyy more characters than Temple Run. :-)
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I gave this game five stars because there was nothing about it that I disliked.  Unlike some reviews, I won't be giving a 10 paragraph description of the game or bore you with insipid prattle about my opinion and minutiae of gameplay.  In the spirit of simplicity and following the same &quot;less is more&quot; I will say that this game is compelling, not too difficult (with increasing difficulty as you advance to the next level), beautifully executed both visually and with the strangely haunting melody that plays.<br /><br />No intrusive permissions, takes up very little space and works perfectly.  I played this on my Asus Nexus 7 tablet.  A keeper for sure.

B005LAIIKI|5.0|Just from a anecdotal point of view, I saw RESERVIOR DOGS at The Chicago Film Festival in 1992, and ever since, I've been in love with the work of Quentin Tarantino. I can recall standing in line to see all of his early films (including TRUE ROMANCE and NATURAL BORN KILLERS, despite Tarantino's ire over Stone's changes to the film), but aside from JACKIE BROWN (which I still believe is easily Tarantino's weakest work), I have not been as instantly attracted to his films of late as of his earlier films. But then, I realized that this may be part of Tarantino's genius: To subvert his own fans' expectations of what his films should, would and could be. He had suddenly gone from Pop Noir Auteur to Grindhouse Reinventor, and like the films for the beginning of his career, he would also spawn a host of imitators with his work in the second part of his career. But as these charlatans would prove, nobody does Quentin Tarantino quite like Quentin Tarantino. And again, this holds true with his Western Revenge Epic/Love Story/History Revision DJANGO UNCHAINED, which is his newest masterpiece.<br /><br />The film begins in Texas two years before the start of The Civil War. In the film's opening sequence, slave Django (Jamie Foxx) is being led by his newest \\"owners\\" until they happen upon traveling dentist Dr. King Schultz (Christoph Waltz, who made his big splash in Tarantino's previous outing INGLOURIOUS BASTERDS) who is, in a way, looking for Django, without knowing it. It also so happens that Schultz is a bounty hunter, and Django can identify the three men Schultz is looking for. The two become partners and friends as Schultz sees Django's natural gunfighting skills, and after collecting many bounties, they begin an epic heroic quest to save Django's wife Broomhilda (Kerry Washington) from her bondage to Calvin Candie (Leonardo DiCaprio), a genuine Southern dandy plantation owner of \\"Candie Land\\". Unfortunately, Calvin's most trusted house slave (a decidedly aged Samuel L. Jackson) sees something beyond the roles Schultz and Django are playing in order to secure the freedom of Broomhilda, and this is where things really begin to enter into bloody revenge territory.<br /><br />As always, Tarantino's dialogue and long monologues drip off the actors' tongues like the sweetest honey, even if much of the dialogue is peppered throughout with the unfortunate slang of the time period. While much of the generous use of the N-word is obviously more reflective of racial attitudes and the language of the time, but most importantly, it's never used merely for shock. But equally impressive is how assured Tarantino has become behind the camera. The long break between JACKIE BROWN and the KILL BILL films showed a director much more confident in his visual storytelling skills as well as his writing and he continues to improve with each subsequent film. Scenes like the dinner sequence at Candie Land and the following \\"phrenology\\" monologue give the same amount of tension and menace as the opening scene of BASTERDS. And the bravura third act is as energetic and tense and explosively violent as anything Tarantino has done.<br /><br />Also, as Tarantino is usually excellent in doing, he assembles a top-notch cast packed with astounding performances. Jamie Foxx, an actor I more often see as an impediment to a film, does some terrific work here as the steely-eyed Django, letting his actions speak much louder than his words (although lines like \\"I like the way you die, boy\\" are handled with deftness and gravity). Washington seems sadly a little underused here, particularly from a filmmaker who has made the current portion of his career writing primarily about strong women, but in Tarantino's defense, this is much less about sexual politics than some of his more recent films, and more about racial ones and this being a \\"man's world\\" again speaks to the time. Jackson is incredible once again as Stephen, a man who sees beyond his master's greed and is fiercelyintelligent and loyal, and seems to be the only man that Candie might consider something of a confidant. DiCaprio gives one of the great performances of his career here. He plays Candie as a genuine bon vivant; a man who lives with the assuredness of his superiority of everyone he lives with, and everyone exists merely for his entertainment. Being a wealthy white male in the South in this period gives him that, but DiCaprio plays that to the hilt, and is clearly greatly enjoying the opportunity to play a Tarantino villain. But yet again, it is Waltz, as he so clearly did in BASTERDS (and earning an incredibly well-deserved Oscar for Best Supporting Actor for that film) who also walks away with this film. The character of King Schultz is so clearly defined from his opening which shows his vast intellect, his charm, his humor and his speed with a firearm, but also as a man who despises slavery despite being forced to work within its confines belies a deeper heart than is clearly displayed. It's a testament to a great actor who you can't take your eyes off or your ears away from when he's onscreen and is one of the great supporting performances of this year.<br /><br />And again, we see a number of bit players to fill out this cast, such as Don Johnson, the great Walton Goggins, Tarantino regular Michael Parks, Russ and Amber Tamblyn, M.C. Gainey, Bruce Dern, Dennis Christopher, James Remar (playing two roles here), James Russo, Tom Wopat and of course Franco Nero, the Italian actor who played the original Django (bearing no resemblance to this film, but Tarantino clearly being a fan of his work). Tarantino's use of music in his soundtrack is, as always, brilliant. The film seems to be meandering at some points as it shows some of the beautiful vistas of the South, but this speaks clearly to the epic sensibilities of the film. The violence of the film, like in most of his films, is at first sudden and brutal, but then, as also with the KILL BILL films and BASTERDS, becomes more gleefully bloody and absurdly comical as the film reaches its crimson-drenched climax. Make no mistake: This is not a film for the faint of heart, but then, none of Tarantino's films are.<br /><br />DJANGO UNCHAINED is yet another massively entertaining shot to the head from one of the great writer/directors of this generation.<br /><br />5/5 Stars.intelligent and loyal, and seems to be the only man that Candie might consider something of a confidant.

B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I was asked to read this book by a coworker at work.  The book was purchased for me and delivered on my desk.  I reluctantly started it, but once I started the book I was hooked.  I loved the book so much I bought my own Kindle copy.  I am IT Operations Manager so I felt the book was written about my life (or close to it). One member of my team saw what I was reading and I mentioned how great it was.  He started the book the next day and told me how much he is enjoying it also.  I am putting together a proposal to purchase  more books for a book club.  I highly recommend this book!

1439152802|5.0|Kate Morton hooked me totally with The Forgotten Garden; I then read House at Riverton which I liked, but not quite as well.  Then came The Distant Hours which was so terrible I skim-read the entire book in about two or three hours.  So I wasn't sure what to expect from her newest offering; would she return to her wonderful storytelling skills of Garden, or would it be more of the same drivel of Hours?<br /><br />I am happy, oh so happy to say that I LOVED this book; it is quite possibly Kate Morton's best so far.  I say possibly, because it's hard for me to say whether I like it better than The Forgotten Garden, since I read that one four years ago.<br /><br />***** WARNING -- I WILL BE AS CAREFUL AS POSSIBLE NOT TO GIVE ANYTHING AWAY, BUT I MAY SAY SOME THINGS THAT SOME CONSIDER TO BE SPOILERS**********<br /><br />In The Secret Keeper Kate Morton tells a story that (as in her other books) veers back and forth between past and present (from 2011 to 1941 to 1929), and between locales (Australia, London and the Suffolk countryside).  The story starts with a modern-day woman who, as her 90-year-old mother lies on the verge of death, decides to finally get to the bottom of a terrible secret that has been buried for 50 years; a murder that she saw her mother commit when she was a teenager in 1961.<br /><br />Although Laurel and her siblings form the modern-day frame, the heart of the novel are Dolly, Jimmy and Vivien, three young adults from dramatically different worlds whose lives become intertwined in WWII London.  If, like me, you love bittersweet tales then it doesn't get much better than this; their story is a string of misunderstandings, good intentions gone wrong and crossed purposes that ultimately lead to tragedy.<br /><br />Kate Morton's talent as a writer truly shines in this book.  She doesn't tell anything, rather she allows the reader to see it for themselves through the eyes of the various characters.  The character of Dorothy/Dolly is a perfect example.  She never tells us that Dolly is seriously psychotic and delusional, but she reveals it in such a way that the reader gradually figures it out (it took me about mid-way through the book before I realized the seriousness of Dolly's issues; other readers may be a little quicker to figure it out).  And she tells her story with her trademark style that is smoothly polished and slightly witty.  Although the book is somewhat long, at almost 500 pages, Morton's style makes for fast reading that you won't want to put down.<br /><br />I loved the way the story ended; everyone got what they \\"deserved,\\" in a way, and yet there was still a strong element of bittersweet, of ships passing in the night.  And the ending provided clarification of all that came before, made it all make so much more sense.<br /><br />The book does have a couple of weaknesses.  For one, the 21st century characters -- Laurel and her siblings -- were flat and boring.  They were obviously needed to frame the story and as the impetus for the investigation into Dorothy's past, but they added nothing else; the modern-day segments were the weakest part of the book.  The other weakness I found was something that another reviewer mentioned, and that is the unlikelihood that the Metcalfe family would have been allowed to inherit Vivien's house; surely her husband would have contested that, since it wasn't even a part of her formal will but was done through a hastily-written letter that had no witnesses' signatures.  This was the only real hole I found in the story, but it is so good otherwise that I will allow the author this one contrivance.  :)<br /><br />I highly recommend this book.  I am glad to see Kate Morton back at the top of her form and look forward to whatever she comes out with next.She never tells us that Dolly is seriously psychotic and delusional, but she reveals it in such a way that the reader gradually figures it out (it took me about mid-way through the book before I realized the seriousness of Dolly's issues; other readers may be a little quicker to figure it out).

The stories of this characters get really intertwined leading one thing to another.<br /><br />What I thought<br /><br />I was really excited about this book. From the beginning I kept telling myself not to expect too much from it, and was definitely expecting a lot of character development... and it surely was that. But, it was oh SO boring. I made myself pick this book up a lot of times after I had really dreaded reading any further. Every page I turned I was hoping that at some point something really interesting would happen, and make me love this book. I must admit I only made it to  half of the book. It is the first review that I  do with an unfinished book. But, I just had to put it out there, that it is a dreadfully boring book. I hope Rowling writes another book that will cure me of this horrible after taste I got left with.<br /><br />I still wonder if in the second half there was something great that I have missed by not finishing this book. Maybe I will complete it, but as for right now, it is just unfinished business. I think I can live with that.<br /><br />I will continue reading from the long pile of books that I have accumulated.

But she is not excited about this news, since she still has unsolved business with \\"almost\\" boyfriend Toph. Also, moving would mean not seeing her bff Bridgette.<br /><br />Her first night at the boarding school is dreadful, but that very night she meets Meredith. They become really good friends on that very first night . Meredith introduces Anna to her friends which leads to her meeting gorgeous and unavailable Ettienne St. Claire. Yes. He has a girlfriend.<br /><br />So Anna deals with her best friend being really far away, figuring out her relatinship with Toph, and trying not to let herself like St.Claire too much.<br /><br />What I Thought About It<br /><br />All together... AMAZING BOOK!<br /><br />I found myself flying through it since it was so engaging and entertaining! Cute, corky and very relatable.<br /><br />Recommend it to everyone who just wants a good book to snuggle up on a lazy weekend. You won't regret picking this book up.

1416955070|5.0|This book was released in 2007!!!!! And I had no idea I was missing out. I am in love with this book. There is a very big but though, I got super creeped out from the big twist at the end (but I totally called it before it unraveled), which left me very confused and curious. So I can not wait to dig my nose into the second book (City of Ashes).<br /><br />So besides the creepy twist, which I will not discuss because it would totally ruin this book for you if you haven't read it, I loved the fantasy world created by Cassandra Clare. I just have to really express how mind blown I am by the way she brought supernatural characters to be so believable! I also loved all of the terms that the author uses. In the beginning I found myself really confused but they are all explained as you read, so as you read on you are sucked in even more.<br /><br />Finally, so far this book has reminded me a lot of the Harry Potter. Valentine is as bad as Voldemort, he disappears when the kids (also main characters) are young and comes back after they have grown up. This doesn't really bother me, since everything else was so original. I will have to wait and see how the rest of the books develop.<br /><br />I loved...<br /><br />The diner scene where the menu consists of appetizing food and disgusting food that is meant for the supernatural beings.<br /><br />Also, words: mundanes, shadowhunters & runes.<br /><br />I disliked...<br /><br />Hodge.

1401216676|3.0|Alan Moore is no Frank Miller.  That said, the story's okay.  Moore does a good job of portraying the Joker as a nuts, but paints him in too sympathetic a light to be the truly evil psychopath that I expect him to be.  And I honestly don't want a definitive back-story for Joker:  I prefer him to constantly change his origin based on his insane recollections.  So it was okay, not great.

The only criticisms would be, as others have noted, it would have been especially nice if these were double-sided so that we could enjoy two masterpieces from each artist and it would have also good if we were treated to &#34;never-before-seen&#34; pieces of animation, rather than the same &#34;classics.&#34; With so much to choose from, why immortalize the same bits of animation which we've seen before elsewhere?<br /><br />PROS<br />- Beautifully produced.<br />- Gorgeous keepsake box. Heavy duty binding & cover and heavy paper stock<br />- Excellent reproductions (with a few soft focus scans)<br /><br />CONS<br />- We've seen some of the animations before<br />- Pages are one-sided<br />- My original set came with damage to one of the covers (deep indentations), but Amazon quickly resolved.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|The game is very fun and addicting a good type of addiction I'm glad it is on my kindle it is awesome I love it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I've never called a book beautiful but I suppose that's because I've never read one. That's really all I have to say about it until I read it again.
B005DZMNHA|5.0|I chose this rating because anything less would be an insult.I will reccomend these<br />recordings to my nearest neighbor.They like The Blues by Chris Rea.
B00ARPMIJE|5.0|This book is about a girl,who is an orphan,with a foster family that hates her. She lives in Carvin, France. One special day she visits Paris and is discover by a New York producer. Her life gets a little crazy after that.
014312093X|5.0|This movie show that a change in your actions will lead to a change in your results. Fascinating movie. From internationally acclaaimed spy-turne -author John Le Carre comes Tinker, Taylor Spy.
0788859544|1.0|Although the DVD case was sealed in plastic as if new, the disk was badly scratched and errored out immediately as soon as the player tried to read it.  After as much clean up as possible it still failed, but at the insistance of a broken hearted 3-year old we kept trying.  After 15 to 20 tries I was able to get it to play, but it still fails occasionaly.  Certainly not &#34;very good&#34; quality.  Which of 2 possibilities do you like? 1. Seller never really looked at it, just called it very good and shipped; or 2. Seller knew it was bad and shipped anyway.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Not a disappointment, but this book certainly does not measure up to catching fire.  Satisfying ending...cannot wait for the movie.
B0012GTZC0|3.0|I recently read Folletts first two books of his Century trilogy so I thought I'd try this.  Ken Follett is a good story teller.  The books aren't deep but they are entertaining page turners.  If you seek entertainment, the book is excellent.
B00865P3AS|5.0|I preordered t his CD. I can't get enough of these guys. My favorite tracks are 2-7-12-and 13.  That's because I prefer the moodier music. But 2cellos are amazing from beginning to end.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|I'm really not a game player, but since I got my Kindle Fire HD, I like to check out the Free App of the Day, and this app's reviews looked interesting so I gave it a try. It took just a little experimenting for me to get the tilting figured out since I never used that before. Easy enough to learn that I didn't read any instructions before starting to play, just started the game and I played to level 10 before putting it down. Although I had read the reviews so I knew to stay on the white circles for food, and avoid the black globs of deadly gunk. And I quickly learned that on the first level, keep your fish inside each of the white circles until they disappear. Just make sure you read the objective of each level when you start playing each level, since each one varies to keep the game interesting. The B&W graphics and peaceful music give this game a calming quality. A static pic doesn't do justice to the way the game plays, the way the food bits send sparkles out as it is eaten by the fish, and the music also plays a matching magical tune at the same time. This would be a great game for relaxing, or for the kids. Give this game a try!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is addicting I went on an 8hour trip and played it the whole time it even works great on my kindle fire I reccomend getting it
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love the show! Love the actors! Love the zombies!!! Plenty of blood and guts, oh and brains. Need I say anymore...
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|It was fun I didn't want to stop playing. I am ready for another similar to become available. I would buy more.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This was the best game ever. It goes to different places like n.y.c and Mexico.this is the best game ever in history and the best thing about this game is that it is free download this game  and you will be very happy.so  get. This game today ...
B0007MWZEK|4.0|I've always liked this product; in fact, I've gone through 3 of them.  It's kind of a pain to clean out but worth it to me for cleaning up cat litter on the floor.  I can just grab it and do a quick sweep without dragging out my regular plug-in vacuum.  Battery doesn't last as long as I wish, but it'll do.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|I bought this for my grandaughters for Christmas and they re enchanted by it. It will be a favorite Christmas movie from now on.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This game has incredible graphics, is fun to play, and is intricate & challenging. I purchased this game during a special promotional offer but it's one of the few games that i have felt was well worth the full price.
B009AMANBA|4.0|went to see this at a movie theater and so moving and sad at the same time. Enjoyed the time and place as I felt I was there if only for a short time, Great movie and alot of history.
B00005JMCN|5.0|This is one of our favorites, with many underlying story levels.  It is a horse race, wrapped up in Americana, of all times.
B001HNE3NO|5.0|This is a great book. I first thought the whole book was set in the nazi era, but it isn't. It ties two worlds together.
B0095XPZBC|5.0|I have read some reviews which pick apart season two's upgrade to Blu Ray. I have to say that I just finished the entire season and totally enjoyed it. If there was anything wrong with it I was too busy enjoying it to notice. I did not buy the regular DVD versions of these because they were like watching a bad VHS tape. If you watch any of the special feastures about the work that was done to bring this to us then you surely know what an astronomical task it was. That aside I am completely happy with the work that was done and I am a very happy owner of seasons one and two. I highly recommend both of these sets.
B008673ZAQ|4.0|Pretty graphic sex so if you are prudish then this is t for you. Good story though. Sequel to Bared to You.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game very challenging and fungi play., I really like when the scenary changed., it's like getting., starting a brand new game., love to play against my db friends<br />I play on my phone and kindle fire
B003PBB4ME|5.0|Perfect for skaters, ive used it with the NEEWER® 160 LED CN-160 Dimmable Ultra High Power Panel and it is great.  GET IT!!!!
B00A8KJK7G|3.0|Children are usually tied up emotionally with their pets and to see a pet die thrice is cruel entertainment(?). For adults the story is mindless for the most part. The first part of the film is slow in moving the story. The middle part has some interest to it. The ending goes on and on and on while adding almost nothing to the plot. There is only the vaguest of themes to this turkey and it is not brought out with any skill. Whatever you do, do not spend any money viewing this awful movie if you must see it. Even the title is a misrepresentation: \\"Franken weenie\\" implies that the dog is a Dachshund but in appearance he is more of a bull terrier. I ended up giving the movie three stars solely on the middle part of the film. For those reviewers who decried the use of black and white, I disagree; that fact was appropriate for this film noir.
0765325950|5.0|Could not have been happier with the ending.  Kind of sad it is all over after twenty plus years.  Branden Sanderson is a great writer.
B007R21JJK|4.0|if you buy this you should know what you are doing, this is not for noobs<br /><br />ok the board is amazing, also great price, so many features and power, if you overclock you will be happy<br /><br />ok, the board is a dream for geeks, it has everything<br /><br />but now the issues, at least for me<br /><br />1)sudden death, my mobo died and no matter what i did, it did not worked at all, i did s short on the battery and came back to life, only happened once<br /><br />2)several bios corrupted, now this is annoying, several times the bios gets messed up, sometimes by itself, sometimes if your oc is unstable, very annoying you will have to reset settings or worse, bios flash or recovery bios from the bios number 2, at least having 2 bios is very useful and safe<br /><br />3)usb3 crap, this thing has intel and via usb3, no matter what those caused troubles for many people including me, in the beginning with early drivers it was a pain, now they are almost perfect but sometimes they start to mess, stupid via and intel combination,  sometimes they work, sometimes not, musb mouse did not worked, x360 pad too, etc, but at least they seems to have fixed the issues by bios updates and drivers<br /><br />4)not the fastest boot times on this board, it takes a little more than other boards, could have been a lot faster<br /><br />--<br />but  the rest is great, you can get latest drivers on tweaktown forums, also bios, and there is a lot of support from forums,<br /><br />tons of overclock options, very cool mobo and good looking too
B001OQCV6A|4.0|It is a really good movie with entertaining plot twists & good interaction between the actors.  I would highly recommend it.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|This game is a must have. Addicting. It's also free.<br /><br />The Good:<br />The gameplay is basically a new-school Helicopter, which was one of my favorite games growing up. Jetpack Joyride is simple with a high replayability. The upgrades and missions are what create the high replayability. The missions are basically tasks that create a different focus when traveling through the levels and can be completed by any skill level. From a phone, Playstation Vita to a Kindle, this game is available on many electronic devices. It's not common we see such a simple game that can hold attention for so long.. No matter your skill level, the game can be completed (getting all in game trophies).<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I honestly can't think of anything.<br /><br />I hope they make a sequel. This game is better than most games I pay $10 for.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|makes it so easy! the plans and bookmarking and sharing  its just wonderful<br /> !<br />really so glad for.the day i downloaded this app  thanks
B00005MAM2|5.0|This movie is great. It comes in a double dvd case. The second disc is all special features. They include a lot of interview/commentary stuff, but for the most part it feels pretty boring and dated because the video quality is very old (it's from the 80's so what do you expect). The actual film on the other hand still looks great by today's standards. No complaints here; this is a solid product.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|If you've ever played an Orisinal game, this game is basically along those lines--simple but beautiful graphics, relaxing repetitive music, straightforward tasks. All in all, something you could never get sick of.<br /><br />This game relies entirely on your device's tilt sensor--you move the fish around the pond by tilting your screen. Avoid the dark circles (they suck energy), try to absorb the light circles (they give energy). Each level has different tasks, like: stay alive for x amount of time, follow a trail of rings, etc. There are 135 levels in total, and you get a score of 1-3 stars per level (stars unlock arcade games like 'how long can you survive?').<br /><br />Definitely worth the download, especially since there are no annoying popups/ads, and it does not require any suspicious permissions!
B000R7I3LY|5.0|This is one of my favorite albums. Every song is amazing. There's not much else to say. / / /
B0001ARCFA|3.0|I picked these up on sale after accidentally trashing my Audio Technica's<br /><br />Quick breakdown:<br />+Very comfortable<br />+Nice quality, crystal clear sound<br />+Open (can be a pro or a con depending how you look at it) You can actually hear outside sounds.<br />+Won't break easily<br />-Doesn't really have the deep bass like some headphones can get.<br />-Volume is a little too low for my taste<br />-Really long regular (non-coiled) wire can be a bit of a nuisance<br /><br />Very comfortable, much more comfortable than my previous pair.<br />The construction is such that it doesn't feel like it would be broken easily.<br />Sound quality seems fine. I'm not qualified to really speak about the technical details<br />it seems fine to me but didn't really 'wow' me like my Audio Technica's did.<br /><br />My main issue is with the volume, I have to crank up the volume to almost max to even get a decent listening level.<br />I'm not talking extremely loud either, just loud enough so I can actually enjoy the music and hear every little detail,<br />I have to turn it up very high to enjoy my music with these. I have no idea why this is.
B00BEZTMQ8|1.0|This review is not about the movie, just about technical stuff.<br /><br />WARNER just despises French People ...<br /><br />All Warner Blu Ray are edited with a DD 5.1 French Soundtrack, Why ? The German Blu Ray is selling with DTS HD MA 7.1 English and German Langage, and all others countries have a DD 5.1. Why again ?<br /><br />I used to play my BR with the original soundtrack, so no problem for me. The trouble is when you want to see  a film in family, our children prefer the french soundtrack, it's justifie.<br /><br />I talk for all French People who Boycott this politic segregationist.<br /><br />In those days, It is unacceptable to have a Blu Ray with a soundtrack not better than a simple DvD.<br /><br />I hope that WARNER will read this message  ... We have already write a petition that will be send. We want an HD Soundtrack.<br /><br />If you are curious, you can read the reviews on Amazon.fr just to see how we are angry.<br /><br />Thanks for reading.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|It is great to download this game for free. I wish that I could get off the first level though. For some reason this level seems impossible.
0345803485|1.0|I'll start by saying I rarely write book reviews, especially negative ones, but this time I am compelled to make an exception. I finally decided to check out all the hype surrounding \\"50 Shades....\\" after seeing a news clip giving the book credit for a new baby boom, a.k.a. \\"Greybies\\", it is said to have started by spicing up the sex life of women who read it. With no more than a \\"look inside\\" on Amazon, I am in agreement with other 1-star reviews that this so-called mommy porn is poorly written, juvenile, and repetitive.  Truth is I didn't make it through all the pages available on Amazon for previewing.  Poor writing aside, there are at least two reasons I think this book is downright dangerous.  First is the author's degrading attitude toward women and the way the book portrays 21-year-old Ana's sexuality as uncontrollably awakened by a man who is pathologically self-absorbed and abusive.  Second is the simplistic way the book links Christian Grey's violent and humiliating treatment of Ana to his own abusive childhood, and then offers the fairytale solution that Ana's love magically changes him into the Prince Charming he was meant to be.  If grown women are being swept away by this kind of misinformation, how much more influence might it have in the hands of already insecure adolescent girls who are still not fully convinced they don't need to look like a Barbie doll in order to be okay?<br /><br />Adding insult to injury is the book's media promotion, as in the news clip mentioned above, and it's promotion by modern gurus like Dr. Oz and his show's resident \\"sexpert\\" Dr. Laura.  I am puzzled that anyone who reads even a paragraph or two of this book can remain unaware of the way it derogates both the psychology and physiology of being a woman. Are readers so caught up in the 50-Shades phenomenon that they themselves fall under the dark spell of some unconscious notion that what women really want is to be back in the proverbial kitchen barefoot and pregnant; back to when we were told not to worry our pretty little heads with complicated matters like casting votes or holding political office, or back to the kind of disempowerment where we were told that saying \\"no\\" to someone's sexual advances really means \\"yes\\" because something just shy of rape is every woman's secret fantasy?  I would hope the response from women everywhere would be a resounding \\"NO!!!!\\". But this book's popularity causes me to fear otherwise. I don't know what's more disturbing, the trilogy's best-seller status, it's thousands of 5-star reviews, the fact that the word \\"Greybies\\" even exists, or the casual \\"....wink-wink, right girls?\\" references I keep hearing when the book is mentioned.  I probably should have read the 4- and 5-star reviews before writing my own, but seriously, who are the people who think this book is worth reading?  And for those couples giving birth to little girl \\"Greybies\\", will you be giving this book to your daughters someday as a sexual primer???
B0094BB4TW|5.0|I love facebook. It is so great to check up on my family and friends. This was a wonderful invention. I do wish that I could remove pictures that others put on my facebook though.

B00AJLHU3K|4.0|For the last three albums, Thompson has been treading water a little, there not bad records, but he didn't see to be pushing himself creatively.<br />Whereas with the release of \\"Electric\\" Thompson seems to had got the fire back in his belly.  Maybe it's because the albums recorded on 16-track, giving a real live, straw on the floor, raw feel to the music (similar to the records he was producing in the 1970's with Ms Linda Thompson).<br />I do like it when Thompson records an electric album (although there are several acoustic track (something for the folkies!)).  I think Thompson is a criminally underrated guitarist, but gets to show off his unique & original style on this album, & being a rock music fan I can't get enough of it.<br />Also about half of the album has female backing vocals, which certainly add an extra dimension to songs, perhaps harking back to the seventies.<br />So, the strongest Richard Thompson since his purple patch in the 1990's with albums like \\"Rumour & Sigh\\" & \\"Mirror Blue\\".<br />The extra CD contains four new tracks, all acoustic, good but probably not song enough to replace anything on album. There's also \\"Auldie Riggs/Auldie Riggs Dance\\", which is taken from his hard to get live album \\"Cabaret of Souls\\".<br />So all that left is that Fairport reunion album to put the preverbal cherry on top of cake.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Excellent TV shows! so glad i made the purchase and bought the first season!!<br /><br />Eye opener of the life in England prior WWI, well played by the actors, excellent story!
B00846F1YW|5.0|I have Mysteryville on my pc so when I saw this for kindle I had to get it. I was not disappointed. I have tried other hidden object games on my kindle and found that they were hard to see. The zoom on this game makes it a lot easier to search. I will definitely look for more games from Nevosoft.
1439153663|4.0|Great book! Yes it's kind of a mix of The Help and Gone with the Wind stories, but the characters are so poignant.<br />Stayed 2 days in bed just reading while it rains...could not put it down. The week after i keep thinking about it and processing the story!! Loved it
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|well so far I was enjoying the game.however there really hasn't been much time to play.its kinds difficult to give s accurate rating with so little Togo on before you arr asked for a rating and to purchase said game.I own quite a few of this type of game and like them a lot I just wish someone would let the game play a bit more. before requiring. the all mighty dollar.
B00005NMVP|5.0|Al Stewart has a way of writing woderfull songs.  Pure poetry in my opinion.  He has a great voice that sounds and feels like he's narrating long lost tales.  The bonus songs and interview are a great followup to the original album.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This book as a good twist. I had no idea what was coming. Great love story. A must read for everyone.
B0001XAS2G|5.0|From the opening track to the end, he just keeps getting better.  Mr. Stewart was smart and lucky enough to have Alan Parsons again produce this album and have a great collection of very talented musicians to work with.

B004BSIJ9Q|5.0|Yes, Kanye West as a person is polarizing at best; however, this collection of masterful beats and introverted rapping is a 10/10 in quality throughout every single song. This is one that you have to listen to, simply to say that you did.

B005FI6IRG|5.0|If the audio CD for &#34;Scipione&#34; by Handel was the greatest Christmas gift I received (although I bought this gift for myself), then certainly the CD &#34;Duetti Da Camera&#34; was the greatest gift to welcome in the New Year - 2013.  Amazon brought it to my attention in my E-mail box, although I was familiar with it already, having checked it out of the library.  It was sitting in a drawer somewhat neglected, and had been renewed a few times.  What was I waiting for?<br />I was familar enough with it to feel instinctively that this little audio CD would be very important to me.  I ordered it immediately and returned the library's copy.  Since then I have listened to it many times, and it has opened up a broad portal to some of the greatest composers in Italy, who remained obscure until now; obscure, because I had not heard their music.<br /><br />The term &#34;duetti da camera&#34; means chamber duets.  The disc contains cantatas for two voices and solo cantatas sung by Philippe Jaroussky and Max Emanuel Cencic.  These works were composed for highly skilled sopranos and alto singers of the Baroque...pastorals with delicate, melodic lines.  The composers featured that I had not heard before are Giovanni Bononcini, Francesco Mancini, Francesco Bartolomeo Conti, and Benedetto Marcello.  It also features Alessandro Scarlatti and Nicola Porpora.<br /><br />The cantata by Porpora  is &#34;Ecco che il primo albore&#34; which flows over five tracks and consists of:  a. sinfonia,<br />b.recitative, c. aria, d. recitative, and lastly, another aria.  It is sung by Cencic solo, and it is the most engrossing music I have heard by Porpora.  As a big fan of Porpora, I admit that I fell in love with that one immediately.<br /><br />But now I love everything on this disc.  Jaroussky and Cencic harmonize together so beautifully.  Since this &#34;New Year treasure trove&#34; has become mine, my musical purview has greatly expanded.<br /><br />Thank you so much, Amazon, for thetip you gave me.  Your loyal customer and friend,<br /><br />G. Kames

B005K0HDGE|5.0|I love Stephen King. Reading this, it had some slow spots. It felt more like one of his short stories dragged out (something along the lines of Shawshank) than a novel at points. But, it was still a great time travel story, with a heavy emotional twist.

B00B2V66VS|4.0|Great game for free defiantly worth downloading! Big improvement from the first! I love playing it! And deff good to pass the time! It's a lot better if you pay it on a tablet. I play it on my kindle HD Fire and its awesome! On my iPhone it sucks kind of cache the screen is to small!
B008AK8FHM|2.0|I can't totally agree with heaven in the eyes as the Doctor describes. I couldn't put the book down. I ad to read until I got to the end. I read and reread and was puzzled. I too had a close call and I did not have an experience the same. I did like how the doctor explained how the different parts of the brain functioned as it stopped working in his case. Every brain is different, I don't agree I would say I saw the same thing. I would say I saw different things from a more religious aspect.
B009LT1YZ6|5.0|The basic concept of this game is simple:  Your fish must swim through dangerous waters eating the white food orbs and avoiding the black poison orbs. Level objectives change as one progresses through the game, so game play is not monotonous.  I'll leave it up to you to discover each level's objective, but suffice it to say that each new task is easy to learn and challenging to master.<br /><br />To change the swimming direction of the fish, one must \\"tilt\\" the device. I am not at all good at games involving the \\"tilt feature\\" of a device.  In fact, my ten year old daughter usually makes fun of my lame efforts to play such games.  However, the controls of this game are logically sensitive so I feel very \\"in control\\" of my environment. I like that the tilt controls can be adjusted to respond to holding one's device flat or at an angle.<br /><br />I really prefer to remain positive when I write my reviews.  However, this time... I have to say that I think the music in this game sounds like an ominous funeral dirge! Of course, you be the judge.  One can turn off sound.<br /><br />Last Fish is very similar to another game on the Amazon market called \\"Osmos.\\"  When I first began to play Last Fish, I actually thought it was from the developers of Osmos.  Both games involve size changing orbs that one needs to avoid.  However, Osmos uses finger touches instead of tilt controls and the game objectives are a bit different.<br /><br />I really like this App.  The intuitive nature of the game makes it so players are not easily frustrated.  The game is challenging, but not impossible.  This game's tilt controls might even help develop patience in its players.  We all need more patience in this world, so that might be a good thing!

1400032717|5.0|Christopher is a highly intelligent autistic boy. He is also a budding mathematician. He gets through life by counting cars every day (four red cars in a row make it a good day, whilst four yellow cars in a row make it a `black day').<br /><br />When the neighbourhood dog, Wellington, is murdered with a pitchfork, he sets out to solve the mystery in Sherlock Holmes style. But as he asks questions, others start to unravel and so too does the security and stability of his life...<br /><br />Written in a clear, concise style, this novel is full of the lists, graphs and puzzles which characterise the narrator's world.<br /><br />Both deeply moving and funny, The Curious Incident manages to entertain whilst also shedding light on an often little understood condition.<br /><br />Highly recommended for adults and young adults alike.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|John Grisham has always been one of my favorite writers but this book has just moved him to the very top of my list!  First of all, I am so impressed by the way he wrote this story from a black man's point of view. Second, the story was quite believable. I was outraged, at times, by the injustice Malcolm endured from being locked up for a crime he did not commit. The outrage I felt is not unlike what I feel when I hear of similar cases in the news. Finally, because I have lived in the beautiful state of Florida, specifically Fort Walton Beach and Jacksonville, I always get a kick out of Mr. Grisham's true references to these areas. This book is a &#34;must read&#34; for those who enjoy legal suspense and mystery!
B000KFB4PK|5.0|I bought this for my 8-year old daughter.  I thought it looked somewhat boyish, but she liked it.  When we got it and organized the links into rainbow order, it looked more feminine.  She has gotten compliments on it, and she enjoys the 'different' look compared to standard watches.  I have not found any difficulties with the closure, as others mentioned in reviews.  It was somewhat difficult to change the links around, but as i don't plan on doing this frequently, it's probably a good thing b/c I guess the links won't easily fall apart on their own!

Uninstalled and reinstalled  twice (lovely--lost all the points I've gained thus far :( and now won't load again-even after shutting down and re-booting Kindle. Hope Imangi comes out with a fix. Fun while it lasts.

B008HK3XU4|4.0|This case is attractive and serves my purpose nicely.  The only negative would be the stand part is a little stiff to begin with and does not want to stand correctly but if you keep working with it,, it does much better.  All buttons are easy to reach and overall does well.

B004PE0SR2|5.0|I won't review this awesome movie since everyone is probably familiar with it. I will describe the quality of the particular product. The packaging is very solid as is expected of a steelbook and house the blu-ray perfectly. The image quality is very sharp and allows the viewer to feel that they are watching this in an actual cinema using a digital projector. Hard to imagine anything better and it is of course extremely collectible in this package!
B0015DYIH2|5.0|The best book yet in the series. So sorry to see it end. Stephanie needs to write another book so that the love story continues.
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|I couldn't figure out where the book was going and thought it dragged on a bit much in the beginning but then it picked up iin the middle and held my interest after that.
B000OT8GCQ|4.0|Great love story. Typical Nicholas sparks book. Tugged at your heart and filled you with hope. I didn't care for the ending. I need a fairy tale ending.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|I loved it when the focus was on the families. It's interesting when he gets into the cultural thinking of the time. But he spends a lot of time on political debate and, frankly, I finally got to where I would skim over those parts. But the families are interesting enough that I will likely read the whole trilogy.

0812550706|5.0|It's a short while into the future, and Earth has been attacked by aliens. The Buggers led mankind to a fragile truce while the International Fleet fights for humanity's survival. Fortunately, an IF force led by Mazer Rackham successfully defeated them -- for now. But Earth believes the Buggers will return, and Earth must be ready. For this purpose the IF seeks out genius children to train in its orbital Battle School. Once trained, they will become the IF's captains, commanders, and generals.<br /><br />Andrew &#34;Ender&#34; Wiggin is one of these children, and Ender's Game follows his progress through Battle School. Along the way we watch Ender's transformation from an innocent child to a fully-capable commander, the psychological damage done to him by the stresses of this process, and the political machinations of a world only temporarily united. In doing so we consider the morality of actions taken under command from others, actions taken to win wars, and the question of how we should go about communicating with alien races.<br /><br />This is one of those books that is considered &#34;fine literature&#34;, leaving the reader with much to think about, while also managing to tell a compelling, interesting story. It's well worth your time to read it.  (Be aware, however, that the sequels are quite different stories -- very good, to be sure, but in different ways from this one.)
B00B7G3Y4U|1.0|This movie seemed longer and dumber.  At least the main character was a better actress.  Less of everything too, and it took longer to get to, then everything happens (essentially) in the last 5 minutes a bam, movie over.  And by everything I really mean nothing aside from the standard crap of the last two.  They need a new theme other than how much money can we make with this franchise.  How about instead use some of that money to hire writes, actors, and heck, maybe get a few extra set locations???  I keep giving you money to upgrade and all you keep doing is blowing it on anything but your movie franchise.<br /><br />Oh and their big NEW special effect was Kintect?  Really.  That was the big thing.  Xbox Kintect light dots, I kid you not.  So even more money for the franchise with a microsoft partnership.  I'm surprised they didn't use Jiff peanutbutter to track footprints, and StayPuft marshmallows for weapons, sprinkle some Lays potato chips behind themselves as an early detection device... chips crackle when stepped on = someone's behind me.  \\"At Lays, we care about your safety in a paranormally active home environment.

0684833395|5.0|Catch-22 is the story of Yossarian, a member of the US air force in World War II. The story loosely chronicles his time on the base. But mostly, it's an extended exercise in ridiculing military processes, thought, and actions, and at demonstrating just how crazy war is. The ridiculously exaggerated characters and their foibles make the story. They're so bizarre and chaotically presented as to almost make it difficult to follow -- but the humor is so excellent that it doesn't matter. It's a long book, worth the time to read.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Do I need to say more about this book? It's completely breathtaking! I feel sorry for the ones who cannot read it because they don't have kindle.. I recommend this book to anyone! I finished it within two days. If you're planning on reading it, plan on doing nothing but reading when you get it. Because I could NOT put it down. It's perfect in every way. All the way up until the ending. It made me cry, happiness and sadness. It's just perfect! Beautifully written and fun filled! Holder and Sky are perfect! This book is just AMAZING! Definitely worth the read and the buy. <3
0756404746|5.0|Epic fantasy book of a decent length? Sign me up. Recommended if you like the Wheel of Time, Brandon Sanderson, and fantasy of that sort.<br /><br />This is an excellent story, with excellent writing: Rothfuss's prose sings. Kvothe, the main character, is well-fleshed-out and quite believable (although at times you'll want to throttle him). The book's magic systems nicely complement the plot without overpowering it; the ones that play the largest parts are logically explained, so when magic does play a role, it &#34;makes sense&#34; (although one notable instance is not fully explained, for dramatic purposes).<br /><br />The story's not without flaws, although they pale compared to the overall quality of the story.  One of the main obstacles Kvothe faces for much of the book is lack of money; this lack begins to wear thin after long enough, but only if you're thinking about it. A bit of a side trip later in the book is pretty abrupt, to the point of almost being a non sequitur. The book is structured as a story within a story (Kvothe narrating the inner story -- his life -- to another character in the outer story); the outer story is a bit more spare of details than I'd prefer, making it harder to relate the inner story to the outer. None of these are large concerns, and I much enjoyed the book regardless.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The Capitol is back on its heels, facing off against the first well-organized resistance it's ever encountered. Led by the Mockingjay (Katniss) and District Thirteen, its land slowly dwindles as the rebellion grows increasingly successful. But what will replace it? This is the question that grows increasingly important as the story progresses.<br /><br />The strength of these books has always been the novel idea of the Hunger Games underlying them. This book transitions from the successful events-then-Games-then-events model to a different one. Rather than following an essentially personal story, with undertones of a broader struggle, this book focuses much more on that broader struggle. From the start, even, this is Katniss's story only because she is important to that struggle, not because she has her own story to tell. The previous two books executed the personal-story angle pretty well; unfortunately, this book doesn't do the war-story angle as well. I think partly this is because Collins's first-person approach and pacing, which she writes quite well, just doesn't work as well for it. This was one part of why I found this book less satisfactory than its predecessors.<br /><br />Past that, of course, we encounter the implausibilities and plot holes which seem to be a feature of these books. The Capitol's technology is too good for me to believe that Katniss could possibly make a leisurely visit to District Twelve at the book's open. I didn't find the ambiguous moral character of District Thirteen to be sufficiently well communicated prior to hearing its reaction to Katniss's demands; their rigidity of society seemed to follow from the exigencies of war, and even more particularly from the confining nature of where they had to survive. (And why wouldn't they have spread out beyond District Thirteen itself, anyway? They had the technology to do it, certainly.) I don't believe Katniss to be such a shrinking violet that the special mission midway through the book should ever have been necessary; she's too intelligent for that. Continuing on, I don't believe President Coin's little twist a bit before the end could have happened -- the end wasn't so close that the gamble could have been sufficiently non-risky yet. And I don't believe anyone in the rebellion could have successfully made the penultimate suggestion an actual policy. Some of the tributes might be up to suggesting it, certainly, but no one (or ones) could have had the political capital to actually pull it off.<br /><br />Those complaints aside, was this an adequate ending to the series? It did the job, but I can't say very much more than that. The first two books I can imagine picking up and rereading pretty easily, but the third one doesn't hold much more than average interest for me in that regard. I did like Katniss's last big development just before the ending -- it had a ring of authenticity to it. (Although it seems not something that would ever have been actually possible, if this were real and not a story.) And the last bit of ending was, I thought, a pretty good wrapup to a best-selling series (certainly better than the end to the Harry Potter books). But overall, this was a step down from the first two books.ould ever have been necessary; she's too intelligent for that.

B008JMKN4Y|5.0|This was such a good book.  I am tired of all the perfect characters and perfect fairy tales in some other books, but Beautiful disaster has real characters with depth and emotion and these characters sometimes screw up and aren't always your favorite people.  The main characters end up having a beautiful, heartwarming relationship, and McGuire did deliver a happy ending - which is a must for me. I'm super excited for the next book - but a little worried that it won't live up to the first one.  What I will say is make sure you have time before sitting down to read this, because after I read this, I went back to page one and read it over again.
B003O86FMW|4.0|I'd promised myself after reading The Hunger Games (borrowed after substantial wait from the library) that I was going to wait for the second and third books of the trilogy to be available from the library before reading them. Two weeks later, tempted by instant gratification by Kindle, I bought and read the latter two books in one weekend, in a single sitting interrupted only by sleep. Yay for self-control.<br /><br />Catching Fire chronicles Katniss Everdeen's time (spoilers for the first book begin here) after having won the Hunger Games in the first book. If you recall, she won a high-stakes game of chicken against the Capitol to do so, threatening to poison both Peeta and herself and deprive the Capitol of any victor rather than play by the rules to produce just one. She belatedly attempted to portray herself as hopelessly in love with Peeta, caught in the throes of irrationality. Was she believable?<br /><br />No.<br /><br />Right off the bat she meets with President Snow, who informs her in no uncertain terms that she wasn't convincing enough and must step it up, particularly during a victory tour midway between Games. She tries, she really does -- but you've read how she does at acting in the first book, so you can guess how that goes. Things spiral downward as the Capitol grows increasingly (yet covertly, to start) antagonistic. Going any further into the plot now would be telling, unfortunately, so I'll have to leave it at that.<br /><br />The novelty of the idea of the first book may be gone. But other than on that point, I think this book is an improvement on the first. Katniss grows significantly as a character. In the first book she was almost unidimensionally concerned with the well-being of her family. She maintains that focus in this book, as one would expect, but she's thinking much more broadly about what that entails, in a world where the Capitol controls nearly everything. She also begins to more seriously consider what it would mean to rebel against the Capitol, both personally and as part of the District Twelve community. Even still, in some aspects she remains as immature as ever -- for example, in her treatment of Peeta any time the cameras aren't rolling. But she's not going to grow up overnight, so it's understandable.<br /><br />As far as the plot goes, it still has holes like the first one did. The idea of the Games as something the defeated districts would submit to remains implausible, although (given this is the second in a trilogy, and you can pretty much guess which direction things are ultimately heading here) at least we start to see actual resistance to that rule that you'd have expected from the start. The semi-obvious twist halfway through is also pretty implausible.  It brings to mind a certain quote from Shylock, although I don't want to say any more to avoid spoiling it too much.  :-)  And on the topic of the Capitol, there are clearly far smarter (and more Machiavellian) solutions to Peeta and Katniss that seemingly were never even considered.  And finally, what in the world could the Capitol have ever been thinking with what they permitted in that one district, and the results of it?  (I speak as circumspectly as I can to avoid too many spoilers, of course.)<br /><br />All in all, though, plot holes aside, this is better than the first book.

B002ZG9968|5.0|This is a cute rom-com.  Pretty standard fare, but nice when you just want a little entertainment without a lot of thought.
0765326353|4.0|Sanderson kicks off his magnum opus decalogy (yes, you read that right -- ten books) in the world of Roshar. Roshar is a world battered by periodic storms -- gigantic winds travel across it from east to west, starting at hurricane force in the east and falling to mere zephyrs in the west. These winds heavily affect life: eastern life is mostly rock-based as it must be able to withstand these winds when they appear. (We don't see much of life in the west, except to know that it has soil, and some well-traveled characters who visit from the east find the ideas of soil and grass completely unnatural.) Stormwinds also supply stormlight, giving certain gems (which serve as the world's money) an inner glow for a time. If you think this might have something to do with the world's magic systems (what! a magic system in a Sanderson book? I am shocked, shocked to find such a thing!), have a gold star.<br /><br />The Way of Kings follows the stories of several characters: Kaladin, a soldier-turned-slave conscripted for use in the fight by Alethkar against the Parshendi, in revenge for their having killed Alethkar's king; Shallan, an aspiring scholar seeking to study under the atheist heretic Jasnah; Dalinar Kholin, a highprince of Alethkar and a leader in the fight against the Parshendi; and Szeth-son-son-Vallano, the assassin who killed Alethkar's king. The book particularly focuses on Kaladin's backstory, interspersing it with the stories of the three other characters as they progress.<br /><br />The world itself -- its creatures, its environment, its features, its weather -- are much of what make this book a good read. This is a world whose features strongly affect the story, to the point of its almost being a character of sorts. Throw in Sanderson's creative, patented magic systems, and you've got a winner.<br /><br />Storywise, however, some aspects of this book are kind of predictable. Kaladin and Dalinar are in the same place, so it's pretty much given their stories will intersect. Kaladin starts out as a lowly slave, browbeaten by the captain overseeing him -- take a guess how his status will change. Shallan aspires to study under Jasnah for not entirely noble purposes -- guess at how that secret will play out. But even still, exactly how the story plays out isn't so obviously guessable. And when it does play out, it's such a joy watching the slow reveal of the world's magic (there are more kinds than one, and we certainly don't learn everything about any of them). The world itself with its distinctive geographic features and its powerful weather system also plays a strong part in the story. So while the book deals in some tropes, it does so entertainingly.<br /><br />The other thing worth noting about this book is its length. I don't mind, even enjoy long books. But this one probably could have been trimmed a bit without losing too much, and probably should have.<br /><br />So is it the best book in the world? Probably not. But it has promise, and it sets up a world whose stories I want to read, and will read as Sanderson writes more of his grand vision. Pick it up if you like long epic fantasy and don't mind that it's going to take at least a decade to fully unwind it.<br /><br />A parting word on this edition of the book: I purchased the hardcover on a whim passing a bookstore going-out-of-business sale. When I opened the hardcover, I discovered that this book contains the most incredible inner artwork: twenty-plus full pages of art, illustrations of settings, beasts, and allusions not fully explained yet. It is magnificent. I was skeptical the paperback (let alone any electronic copies) would come anywhere close to doing the illustrations justice. (I usually buy paperbacks, borrowing library copies when I can't wait. And if I do buy a hardcover, I buy the paperback when it's released.) When I looked at a paperback months later in stores, I discovered I was right. The illustrations in the paperback are rubbish -- it's like you're only getting half the book that way. Don't shortchange yourself here -- get the hardcover. It's worth it for the illustrations alone.  (Feel free to get the ebook too if you like portability, but beware that it can't be appreciated nearly as well in that format.)'re only getting half the book that way.

B001ANSSDC|5.0|Excellent book.  It was an easy read.  The characters were very believable and likeable. I would recommend it to my friends.
0439023521|3.0|It's been a rather long time since I did that -- read a reasonable-length book in a single sitting. Last time I did that was...maybe Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince? In any case, it's been awhile since I read a true page-turner I wouldn't put down. (Although I'm certain the relative brevity of this book -- I have read Brandon Sanderson, Patrick Rothfuss, and the Wheel of Time lately -- had something to do its being awhile.)<br /><br />How to describe this book plotwise? Think The Lottery meets reality TV, or think kids meet the gladiator arena. Basically, the one far-dominant nation-state in North America -- the Capitol -- has utterly subjugated twelve subordinate districts (and reduced a thirteenth to irradiated embers). Each district must annually send two &#34;tributes&#34; -- a male and a female between the ages of 12 and 18, chosen by lottery -- to fight to the death in the arena in the Hunger Games. The Games are a pageant from start to finish to entertain the Capitol, which eagerly watches (and forces the districts to watch) until one tribute remains (to be showered with honor for life, and whose district will be honored for that year). The arena itself is a massive tract of land under the total control of the Capitol -- terrain, vegetation, weather, and resources. The tributes learn skills and acquire supporters (who can sometimes send supplies), then they are deposited in the arena. It's a fight to the death -- first for a Cornucopia of supplies positioned at the arena entrypoint, then a protracted strategic dance to attack, and survive the attacks of, the other tributes.<br /><br />A logical plot? Well, not entirely. The Capitol and districts occupy much of the United States and/or North America, but the impression is that at most total we're talking a few million people, with the rest of the area wild. Given the state of Capitol technology at least, this underpopulation is implausible. And it's hard to think the brutality of the Games a believable possibility in some distant future of our world. (Judged closer in proximity to the original gladiators, maybe. But evil today is generally much more subtle than it was back then -- or at least concerning the United States area particularly -- and I see little reason to believe that subtilty might disappear.) But it's enough to hang a story on it -- and a good story, too. The action comes steadily once the contestants enter the arena, and before then the slow reveal of the mechanics of the game remain captivating. The heroine's cleverness abounds, in a way that naturally fits her youth (and probably would not fit an older, wiser character), and the tactics are a pleasure to consider.<br /><br />This said, this remains a young-adult novel. The action is mostly for action's sake. We don't learn enough of the underpinnings of the world to truly understand how it has come to be, or why it truly is so, or how it might be (at the far periphery, of course) even ambiguously &#34;moral&#34;. We aren't left with much in the way of poignant questions to ponder, of the sort a far better book like Ender's Game (or even the later Harry Potter books) offers. The heroine has some depth, and some of the Capitol stooges surprisingly acquire a little personality by the end, but characterizations are mostly shallow. We're mostly left with a lot of grit (they're trying to kill each other, remember? and of course pageantry will demand it sometimes be brutal) and a dilemma that gets solved. Which is all perfectly fun, to be sure -- but it's not the sort of thing that would cause me to sidetrack reading a hundred pages of the book just because I happened to rearrange it on my bookshelf. (Which happens with all too much frequency for me...)<br /><br />It was a two-month wait for the hundred-odd people ahead of me at the library to read this so I could borrow a copy; I'm currently 58 of 72 for the second and 22 of 31 for the third (having not considered that, given queue lengths, I should submit holds early, &#34;freezing&#34; holds if needed before they might prematurely vest). Will I wait for my name to move to the front of these queues to continue reading? It seems likely I will, rather than buy the later books to read them faster. I found the characters interesting, yet I'm not emotionally invested in them, and the ending is not a cliffhanger of the sort demanding immediate resolution. I can wait.<br /><br />(...and, two weeks later, I find myself buying the entire series in Kindle editions on Amazon. Because the library queue is still huge, instant gratification is irresistible, and I keep having to watch out for spoilers when reading things online. Perhaps I should add another star...but no. This book was what it was, and needing to read further doesn't change that.)bmit holds early, &#34;freezing&#34; holds if needed before they might prematurely vest).

I can wait.<br /><br />(...and, two weeks later, I find myself buying the entire series in Kindle editions on Amazon. Because the library queue is still huge, instant gratification is irresistible, and I keep having to watch out for spoilers when reading things online. Perhaps I should add another star...but no. This book was what it was, and needing to read further doesn't change that.)
B007M45PMU|5.0|Here's a great new band - They were nominated for a Grammy for this (best Americana album) - they didn't win, but losing out to Bonnie Raitt is nothing to be ashamed of!
B003ODIZL6|5.0|i don't like is that you don't have a search thingy. - Miley Cyrus<br />well have a very special valentines day, love Miley Cyrus bye bye.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|Beautiful and touching! My four year old has physical differences and pray that her life will be overwhelmed by the kindness of people to outshine the cruelty of others. What a triumphant story!
B003WUYRGI|5.0|well its okay, but i think you guys should put a search thingy on here.  -keyondra lashay lee p.s have a good day.
B000W93CHC|5.0|I am so sorry that there are no more books on this subject from Ken Follet (hint), I was so sorry to get to the end that I kept putting it off, but eventually had to finish it. Great topic and excellent book!!!!
B005K2YRVG|4.0|I ordered this cover for a  friend as a gift and seems to working just fine for her. Seems really sturdy.well built, and I think it looks really sharp!!
B000003N7K|4.0|Hartman's voice is undoubtedly sumptuous and beautiful.  I withheld a star<br />because I felt that it was a voice admiring itself more than conveying the<br />meaning of the song.  I felt all the songs on the album were approached<br />in the similar way.  I think a voice with a bit more bite and less predictability<br />would mesh better with the searching and spontaneous Coltrane.  Overall<br />though, I liked it.
B007KOMTUI|4.0|Loved this show, but the Amazon view instant feature I purchased this series on had some streaming issues.  There were a few more interuptions for buffering than I regularly have with other video streaming source, but these interuptions were not out of control.  I also noticed I seemed to have more interuptions when I was trying to watch on my PC than when I used Amazon Instant Video through my Xbox.  Interuptions were almost non-existant when I switched to watching using the Xbox app.
B006XF5BTG|5.0|Very good reading material, lots of very good information. After reading though it once, I decided to read it again and put in writing many of the good info. This was to my surprise much more writing than I thought would do, but this was so much good information , I did not want to forget. I will incorporate many if not all this material into what I already know and will be on a very good path for my physical well being. I find myself telling my wife a lot of tips from this book to pass along the the rewards.

B00992CF6W|5.0|I really like this game!!!!it is just like minecraft.it has creative mode and survival mode.Creative mode has unlimited blocks and survival mode has creepers and archers and might even have endermens!!!
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|this game is very good. PEOPLE WHO SAY THAT THIS GAME IS A RIP OFF PROBABLBLY DON'T EVEN HAVE MINECRAFT PE!
B00B2QA646|5.0|It's a very unusual way to film this drama, but it's a fabulous theatrical one to create portraits of a very different type of loves, that keeps your attention until very last scene. Great screenplay, camera-work, casting, music, costumes,set-designs.
B00013M6NK|5.0|The product arrived well, just what I expected and at the indicated time, I came to a no box but sealed just in case

1475143389|5.0|This Book is a must read for anyone who is trying to lose weight or gain muscle. Just apply the information to your lifestyle and you will get results quickly.
B009XHAM8G|5.0|As many times as I've read this it still makes me cry.  This is a wonderful book, I promise to read many more times.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|I have seen this movie about 8 or 10 times, on the i-Max 3D, on the small screen Blue Ray.  The 3D on a big screen 3D TV is excellent! Only complaint is that the 3D doesn't include the 8 minutes of the 2nd edition of the movie.  Great show, Amazon got this out to me quickly. Very satisfied.
B00910Y1OQ|4.0|I loved the artwork for this game-very crisp and bright! The game play reminded me a bit of jewels legacy or jewels star... but there are also aspects like collecting game pieces to be used later in the game like bombs (to blow up large sections), hourglasses (for extra time), etc. That makes the game successfully stand on its own as a fun puzzle player. It gets progressively harder each time you get transported to different areas... less time to complete harder challenges can be quite frustrating... but I still haven't failed a challenge yet- even when I come close to running out of time, so maybe it's a &#34;little easy&#34;, but I guarantee you'll find it entertaining.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This Is a fun temple run type game. It is a bit laggy on kindlefire and has a few issues however it is worth getting and its free
B0055SWM08|5.0|I love that this game! The graphics and soundtrack are good, and the game is challenging but still fun. It even gives you the exact number of the (minimum) amount of moves it should take to complete the puzzle... but just because you know the number doesn't make it easy! Great game because it makes you use your brain.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|you have to get this game all the games are the best you could ever get. my brother and I both enjoy these games. GET THIS. GAME! !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!#
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I like the new system with the rope slide and narrow bridge tilt... but it seems to be a bit easier than the first one... and is it me, or are there more powerups available to you from early on? The graphics look better, and make sure you even jump over small branches on the path, because now they slow you down to the point where the giant monkey creature gets right on top of you. Still great and worth playing!
B009D7CP2M|5.0|Wow, I have not been compelled to write a review on a book in a while but this book was so disturbingly awesome I have to give my two cents.  I vaguely remember when this was first released, and felt it to be too morbid to pick up.  But something grabbed me recently about this that I had to get my hands on it.  At first, I was a little put off by the pretentious vocabulary but it became necessary to illustrate that Eva was an educated person, far from the stereotypical ignorant other with her head in the sand.  Which brings me to a few questions that I felt was being thrown around the entire novel: Can a mother not like her own child?  Does she instinctively know that evil rests within her offspring?  And does any of her feelings then influence that child?  As a mother, I found that difficult to wrap my head around, but I suppose mothers know when their children are &#34;bad&#34;.<br /><br />This is a thoughtful, disturbing read.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A very interesting and enjoyable read. Having never read a Stephen King novel, because I'm not one who enjoys gruesome fantasies could not resist this story. When I realized the story was about time travel, (which intrigues me since that movie I watched  called The Time Machine, the first one) I immediately bought the book. That's when I realized why the title of the book was 11/22/63. I remember getting out of school early that day. I also remember seeing grownups crying. There was crying going on all over the school. I didn't understand why either. All I cared about was getting out of school early. Anyway, this was a wonderful story that started out as a time traveler story that ended up being a love story. The Kennedy assassination part of the story added an element to the story that kind of made me one of the characters, since I actually had experienced that period in time.<br /><br />This was a wonderful book that will linger in my thoughts for a long time. Maybe I'll try another Stephen King book. Not! I prefer to wallow in my thoughts about Mr. Amberson and Sadie. I wonder what ever became of them? If Mr. King, were to write another story, that happens to be about Sadie and that familiar stranger from her past, Mr. Amberson, there wouldn't be the slightest hesitation to read that Stephen King novel! 11/22/63 was a great read.
B0081JPTCQ|5.0|This app is fantastic for people like me that love to keep their 'stuff \\" neat and organized! This app makes this task unbelievably simple--I love it!!!
B001UV4XJ2|5.0|I am a Harry Potter fan. Haven't got to watch this on my new BluRay Player yet, but it should be pretty good.
B005USZYDU|3.0|First read in this Theodore Boone series. Quick read, engaging!  Will look for next book and compare to other Grisham books.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I bought this for my wife for x-mas. She Love batman. She now has all the batman movies. Great movie!!
B001BKTEZA|5.0|I love Steinbeck; always have. I first read this novel in high school and so many quotes and scenes stay in my head like a really good movie, 35 years later. I can just see and hear them. That is why Steinbeck is just a good author and won the Pulitzer Prize for this novel in 1940.<br /><br />He really captured the emotions, actions, and decisions of the people caught in the horrifying Dust Bowl of the 30s.<br /><br />Not to mention the incredible and realistic dialogue between characters.
B00009W0U4|5.0|This is a very daring film that pulls no punches very hard too watch in the sense that the substance is strong.  Performances are up and Monica Bellucci knocks it out of the park.
098555780X|5.0|Great instruction for the beginner. There are dozens of projects, many dozens more color pictures illustrating step-by-step moves. Includes dozens of online resources. TIAT hits a home run with this one. Definitely recommended.
B007JWQ68W|5.0|OMG!  This book changed our lives!!!  We have switched over to barefoot shoes and our balance and walking are soooo much better.  The  book itself is interesting and informative as well as historical.  We also now eat Chia seeds daily.  We have purchased at least 12 copies and have given them to all our friends and some relatives for Christmas gifts.  Everyone who runs and many who only try to 'walk' will love this book.  Many shoe companies now make a barefoot shoe and ALL refer to THIS book.
B00B7G23KQ|1.0|I wish they could just beat the ghost and make at least one good happy ending or at least let someone live that's not evil.

B00APJLFEG|5.0|This movie is super cute and i am thinking about buying it.Also buy it in HD if you have HD because i rented it without it and it was not as good as i know it could be.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Game is pretty cool with competitive campaign and awesome fun online mode<br />So I recommend people download it<br />And it's worth its money
B0054JZC6E|5.0|so far so good. I haven't unlocked very many of the games yet, but the ones I've played have been fun and provide just the right amount of challenge. There are plenty of opportunities to earn points to unlock more games if you get stuck.
B00A4TKDKY|4.0|Loved this collection.  Hadn't played Buddy Guy for quite sometime and was good to have it back in my CDs.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Did not like the ending.  Unbelievable.  Stupid.  Even bad police work could have solved this murder.  Good story until the ending.
B000002J0B|4.0|Brought back great memories and &#34;drama&#34; from the days when my kids were playing this albumn constantly in their rooms.
B006TZBGBW|5.0|ive seen the exact same box set chepaer on ebay,so i allways shop around for the cheapest prices on cds before i deceide to buy them,a bit like hmv who are allways overpriced on most of their cds.<br />i dont like cardboard sleeves that come with cds,its a bugger to get the discs out of them,and then you have to put them back into the sleeves after your finished using the discs,and why not use normall cds cases or use better material when manufactouring cd box se,so the material wont break in half.<br />material is allways the issue when it comes to box sets.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|At first I was like 'who cares?'. But then my step sister got it and I LOVED it!MUST HAVE,MUST HAVE!
B000FC10QG|5.0|A must read for students of M and A, LBOs, investment banking and negotiation.  A great look inside Wall Street's boardrooms with plenty of high drama during the LBO negotiations for RJR Nabisco.  A seat the the Wall Street high stakes poker table!  If you are not a fan of Wall Street drama, chapter 2 alone is worth reading for the history of RJR and its relationship to Winston Salem, NC.
B0052RE4MQ|4.0|This book had all the characteristics that was needed to make a good book and was so true to the first one (Matched) that I couldn't stop reading.
B000LC4TJ0|1.0|My best advise is to watch a couple scenes on You Tube, before committing to buying this.  It is by far the worst opera production I have ever seen. The director must have a real disdain for Mozart, because he did everything is his power to minimize Mozart and Da Ponte's genious work. It's one thing to see a work in a different light, but this production was all the about the stage director's ideas.  Mozart's and Da Pointe's intentions were just in his way. Not even a great group of singers could turn this ugly stage direction into something of value.  The direction was ridiculous and many times laughable....the Countess writhing on the floor during \\"Porgi Amor\\",  Susanna and the Countess making out with Cheribino during the dressing aria, this Eros dancer on the Count's shoulders during \\"Hai gia venta la causa\\", Bartolo in a wheelchair and so soooooooooo much more.  This experience was nothing but a very bad memory.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|The first book was riveting, the second a little disappointing, and with this one redeeming. The action is again refreshing and new, unlike the second book. I definitely wanted to get to the conclusion of the series and had a fun ride doing so. Not just a series for young adults, but for all who love a well paced sci-fi action book, interwoven with human emotion.
B003FSTN52|5.0|I enjoyed watching the first season of this series because it seem to be so realistic to the way things actually happen in a court room.
1449410243|5.0|Bought this as a holiday gift for my daughter-in-law who has a cat that weights about 15 pounds - huge! She loved the book and my daughter, for whom I bought the &#34;I Could Pee on This...&#34; volume, laughed so much I ended up buying another copy for her. We are cat lovers and these books are great gifts for any cat lover!
B006YG9HJE|5.0|I chose a five star rating for this movie because I love all of the previous Nikita  movies watched in the past.
1452110581|5.0|I bought this book for my daughter who is a cat lover. She thoroughly enjoyed the book. Poems are great.
B003L77G10|5.0|The second season of the good wife is just as well written as the first season.  Looking forward to another good season.
B00AEK9BKQ|5.0|I really loved this film.  I admire the way Helen Hunt portrayed the sex therapist with such zeal, such human and raw emotion.  The movie was definitely worth watching and when it finished, I wanted more.  It was extremely touching and all consuming.
B001AITGWE|4.0|This movie was pretty good. I believe anyone who like a flick with a lot of drama this is the movie for them.
B0090SI42Y|1.0|With a set up like this, why did I buy this film?<br />I purchased it because I am a fan of Russell's.<br /><br />My only previous viewing of a film like this was Crouching Tiger which was a hit & I liked it<br />1. IF you hate rap music you will NOT like having to hit the mute button during THE LOAD rap music parts.  Terrible<br />2. Ok, Russell an Oscar winning actor.  What was he doing in this mess?  A favor to someone?  This is beneath him now-needs much better material.  It was his first film release in two years & it had to be this mess.<br />3.  Asian actors speaking English to themselves<br />4.  A small spoiler alert-a bad guy wearing SUNGLASSES?  Think there were cool in this time frame or something?<br /><br />The story kept jumping around, hard to follow.<br /><br />Let's get to the the blu ray.  Has an extra \\"A Look Inside\\" which since the film bombed with critics & at the box office So, the blu ray has this extra, but.......  IF you watch it do NOT unless you are a fan of this THREE LETTERS director.  It is NOT a making of or anything, it is 3 letters talking about him with BARELY any information on film.<br /><br />Picture quality fine.<br /><br />Unless you like kung fu films you will NOT like this film even if you are a fan of Russell's or Lucy Liu's.  Otherwise, the only names in the cast.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Ike's them coming.  His books are all do well written and I recommend this author to ever one as often as I get the chance
0060936223|3.0|I enjoyed the first half of this book, when Patti Smith was an anonymous bookstore clerk, but the second half was a catalog of her social conquests, the famous men she slept with, and her artistic successes. I know artists -- especially punk rockers -- like to think of themselves as misfits and outsiders, but I came to see Smith as a Queen Bee who used her talent, sex appeal and networking skills to reach the top of a very competitive milieu -- the New York art and music scene of the 1970s.
B005S9EKCW|4.0|I'm French and I've just seen the movie (which came out last week here). I wasn't sure I still wanted to see it after reading the terrible reviews it'd been given in France (sorry!) but I'd been so seduced by the trailer and Hathaway's voice that I went anyway and I simply loved it. I haven't read the book (I've just started actually: 60 pages out of 1600... hum) but I understand why people here find the movie rather bad: it's not exactly as \\"social\\" as Hugo wrote it. The movie concentrates on the \\"romantic\\" side rather than on the criticism of the society and the historical context of the time. Yet I was completely taken. I loved the songs (I didn't know the musical), I'm a big fan of Anne Hathaway and Hugh Jackman and was completely delighted by their acting. I cried as I hadn't cried in a long time in a theatre and wanted only one thing when the film was over: see it again! The only negative thing in my opinion was the singing and acting of Russell Crowe. I didn't like his voice and really thought that he couldn't act and sing at the same time. There was no emotion on his face. But still: it's a great movie! Only one piece of advice to you all: read the book!!! I know it's a very biiiiiig one but it's a French masterpiece by one of the best French writers! :-)
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this app! It works great on my Kindle Fire! I got it and it is my face game! Totally addicting! GAME RECCOMENED

B00846F1YW|5.0|Fun game. I normally don't like games that require searching for hidden objects, but this game is interspersed with other puzzles as well. Overall a worth while game but there's a lot of dialogs to skip if you're not into storylines.
B000MCIBB6|5.0|Not much else to say about this. If you like The Doors (and you should) you should listen to this one. Los of musical exploration with some hits to go. Most of the material has the great lyrics and sonic backing that we all know and love.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I don't know how to get another horse. every time I try it said that I have to try again and it counts down frilom 15 I really love horses but how do I get more
B0012GMUMC|5.0|Yeah this it's my favorite group. This cds brings a wide experience about sound of this amazing group. I like cds over mp3 because i prefer music with grat sound quality that mp3 purchase don't have. I made my own mp3 with best quality from original sources. And this cd it's perfect for all fans of this great band.

B005K01VZS|4.0|This book has a great message no matter what religion you are. My only criticism is that in the middle I feel that it does drag a little bit.
B0040UAYI4|5.0|this product is okay. may take others awhile to figure it out. still does the job over all. thank you
0792839749|5.0|Great movie to show at school! The kids loved it too! It also helps that I told them what it was about before we watched it and sang a song from it.
B0036S4C6G|4.0|I haven't finished the book yet, but its a strong \\"like\\"for me, so I'm starting a review. Egan has a unique vision and writing style, clearly not for everyone, the reviews are all over the map. To me, she captures strange moments of insight, as well as the stomach churning realizations that most people have but don't talk about. And its not twee. If you don't mind works that are a bit difficult, and have tolerance for unconventional characters, give it a whirl.
B005J32Y6Q|4.0|The 3D version of the Blu-ray starts with 30 seconds of FBI warning and studio logo, which cannot be skipped.  The performances are shot on enormous stages in large arenas.  The lighting is too weak to bring out the best in 3D, and spotlights sometimes shine in the camera.  Still, the camera handles the spotlights very well, and the production is astonishingly good for a live performance.  The biggest flaw is that the camera is usually too far from the performers.  When the camera does get close-up, it often chops off the lower half of dancers' bodies, while leaving ample space above their heads!  In spite of these flaws, this HD recording shines in 2D mode, and is definitely worth a watch.  Kudos to Flatley and his crew for having the courage and resolve to produce this in 3D.
B00A77II0U|4.0|Well worth the money took me longer then twenty minutes to get through it.  My ten year old daughter also likes it .
B0082Z1CVQ|4.0|its a great classic novel that teaches many morals and values in the life of a family. it might have a long exposition which you have to patiently wait to get over with. an all age book
B001ANSSDC|5.0|Just read the book and you will be pleased. The turn of events kept me guessing. I was surprised at parts of the story, because the author never gave it away.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|Awesome game you should get it<br />It fun funny spectacular get it you should get it the game yah go download it
B000244FDW|5.0|I prefer this version as being closer to the book and the mores of Austen's time, not a sexed-up version.

B009JBZH54|5.0|I bought this for my husband and was a bit concerned that the product description didn't say clearly that it includes the digital ultra violet copy. I'm so happy that it does! I'm not usually into movies of this genre but I very much enjoyed all of them and glad to have it in our collection!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|Interesting book, well written, definitely would suggest it to others regardless of whether or not you are interested in Apple or know anything about them (I didnt before this).
B008CP6RWU|2.0|This was a short 'Journey' for me. I really don't see how others can rate this highly. I am fairly new at video games being recently retired. Those I have played so far have entertained me for months. This game was over with in about 3 hours. I think this game would be good for a kid, say 10 & under, especially a girl. The active figure seems to resemble a female in a cloak. Anyway I would not recommend this game as worth the money it costs. I now a gently used copy for sale cheap, any takers?
B000FC12C8|5.0|No nonsense, a lot of well thought out examples, and solid practical advice when it comes to avoiding the pitfalls of investing in equities.
B008D28HYS|4.0|I love to play it. It keeps me guessing. I do wish it had a \\"help\\" button. To get help on where to place a few when help is needed. That's the only reason I didn't give it a 5
0893815233|3.0|I am not very artsy inclined.  This photo essay, as I am told such books are, was my attempt to understand photographic art a little better.  I am not disappointed, the book sits on my coffee table as a decoration as a hint to others that maybe I have something interesting to say about art.  Well..... I don't, but at the very least the Photographers story and explanation of each picture was an interesting read.  I guess I feel a little more artsy having read it.
0345803485|2.0|After hearing for months about “50 Shades of Grey” by E L James I decided to purchase the first book in this “Mommy porn” trilogy.  What I discovered was that this is a terribly written book with little to no plot.  The book “50 Shades of Grey” is about a young girl, Anastasia, or “Ana”, who falls crazy in love with a ridiculously successful, young man by the name of Christian Grey.  The story is about Mr. Grey’s almost unbelievable infatuation with the plain Ana and tells the story of their passionate and kinky love-making life.  The book presents an unlikely love story, with incredibly vivid sex scenes, and centers around the theme that with love and patience, we can all change for the better.<br /><br />The love story presented in “50 Shades of Grey” is very unlikely.  First, we have a billionaire man, with astonishing good looks and a body to die for gain interest in a small-town, “plain Jane” from the South embodied through Ana.  Second, Ana is thin, shy, and very self-conscious yet she manages to garnish the attention of Mr. Grey—the handsome billionaire.  Not only does plain Jane Ana spark Mr. Grey’s interest, but she manages to become one of his adored “sex slaves” or “submissive.”<br /><br />Undeniably sex is key in “50 Shades of Grey” and appears on almost every page of the book.  The sex in the book is not traditional, missionary-style sex.  Instead, the sex is passionate, impromptu, out of nowhere and filled with, eh, surprises.  The sex in the book is kinky and Mr. Grey doesn’t get any kinkier with his own “Red Room of Pain” where he has all of his toys to strap, spank, and physically inflict pain on his lover, Ana.  For example, Mr. Grey uses toys such handcuffs, blindfolds, floggers and balls to keep sex new, thrilling and exciting with Ana.  In addition to the toys Mr. Grey likes to slap and spank his Ana—in one scene he makes her cry from the nearly brutal spanking he gives her.  The most interestingpart of all of this is that it takes place with rules and contracts in the background ensuring the confidentiality of their unique, kinky sex life.<br /><br />Despite having little plot or theme, the book does attempt to surround itself with a main idea which is that people can change over time with love and patience.  In other words, love conquers all.  It is clear that Mr. Grey is a messed up individual with a disturbing past that involves emotional and sexual abuse.  The author reveals that Mr. Grey was sexually “abused” as a child, or at least that his mother’s friend has sex with him and taught him “everything he knows” about dominant/submissive sex.  Mr. Grey’s peculiar past does not permit him from allowing Ana to touch him or even make eye contact with him during sex.  Clearly, Mr. Grey is not normal and needs help.  How a troubling individual can find it in himself to change into a better lover who is not afraid to love is how the story basically ends.  For Ana, she wants to love Mr. Grey and spend every minute of her life with this amazing man.  However, he makes it clear that this is strictly physical and that he does not plan on falling in love or making Ana his girlfriend.  But actions speak louder than words and with time, Ana is able to crack the tough exterior of Mr. Grey and show many of his vulnerabilities.  Ultimately, it appears that Ana and love conquer Mr. Grey’s love but only time will tell.<br /><br />Although the book has amazing sex scenes, I would not recommend this book to anyone.  I feel that the story is completely unrealistic, the characters are unbelievable, the plot is basically non-existent and after reading sex scene after sex scene you start wondering where the story is going.  There is a lot of repetition in the story and it seems that other than sex there is nothing much else going on in the story.  The story lacks substance, has little to no structure and is poorly written at most.  Nevertheless, the story does seem to capture the reader and make you want to turn the next page to see what happens next.  I read the story is two sittings so it definitely does catch one’s attention; but as an overall piece of literature it is quite disappointing.<br /><br />Work Cited<br />James, E.L. (2012).

0307891372|5.0|If you are a serious gammer, then you have to own the game guide.  You have the upper hand on every noob and your challenges against the 'good players' even if your an average player is improved.  Highly recommend.
B000V1Y43W|5.0|My wife and I purchased this movie so we would know what the heck the grandkids were talking about.  However, the movie contains a couple of good life lessons (real important stuff) and as a car guy I really appreciated the car detail. I would recommend this movie, loads of harmless fun.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fun game to play and pass the time. It also gives you discounts on various places and items for every 1000 points you rack up when you sign up as a online gamer
B00BETX5PS|1.0|The quality of the HD streaming was horrible.  The movie started and stopped and was pixilated from begining to end
B009WO7NQO|5.0|I'm so glad they made a star wars version and not a trekie version. This is a blast and combines the space with the regular form of playing

1451695195|5.0|This book is a little more technical than some books you might read about near death experiences, but  It is worth the time to read it. What a great book!
B000VECAC6|5.0|This I purchased for my husband he just loves the Monty Python's Life Of Brian, nice to view on the Blu- ray, thought that gave the movie a special look with the nice clear picture, he was very happy with his gift from his dear wife!. Barbara Petersen. Australia.
B003I55BIA|5.0|I gave Perfect Chemistry a five star rating because I could not put It Down for Four days. It has intriguing twists and turns. The characters actions gave me butterflies in my stomach. It felt like the whole time I read it I was there in the world that Simone Elkeles wrote. She wrote the story with so much feeling and so much wonder. At parts there were some high emotion but at the end I wanted to reread it. It was just that good. I didn't know what to expect when I started to read it but after I read a couple off the chapters I felt like this is how a book should be. Know I have set a high standard for the books, I read to be like this one and involve and intrigue and wonder.
B001NPDCFQ|5.0|Well put together classic movie package with a beautiful booklet,  a time period that stands out, how wonderful the girls look, and how wonderful the whole movie is, still holds it's own and has stood out in the test of time. Barbara Petersen, Australia.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is our favorite show and we love it!  Never a dull moment.  Always looking forward to the next episode.
0553582445|3.0|In no way can this book be considered the beginning of a standalone series. It borrows locations from the Liveship Traders trilogy, which is fine, but it also relies heavily on the events of the Farseer books, and I don't think you'd enjoy this if you hadn't enjoyed that.<br /><br />The page count seemed oddly high for such a direct, unconvoluted little chase-story, but the pages flew by quickly - it felt small in scope as there's only one POV.
B0067R0APK|4.0|the videos forecast are good and they updated it so it updates more than every hour.  I cant think of anything else to say.

B004A8ZWVK|1.0|Gee. This show makes it look like negroes love fried chicken! Outrageous stereotyping!<br />How is it that reverse racism beats straight out racism?!<br />Race bashing. Revenge? Wow.<br />There is the token \\"cool\\" white person though.<br />Honestly, \\"Mississippi Burning\\" is a viable movie about racism in the past. Strong, unlike The Help, which is so repulsive and weak. Liberal Hypocrites enticing one another into self-righteous indignation.

B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so fun but i cant get back on my kindle now i am so mad i was about to hatch amethyst and seasonal dragon so mad
B0086700CM|1.0|Wow!  I want a game that keeps me interested and challenges me.  This one was a challenge but a very stressful challenge that seemed to rely mostly on how fast my fingers worked.  I removed the game from my Kindle.  I'm sure for lots of people, it would be the perfect game for them; but I'm more the word game or backgammon type of person.  If you like a game that requires very quick fingers you may enjoy this game - it got great reviews from the people who liked it.
030759565X|5.0|The photos are beautiful, the recipes are bountiful, the text is classic Deb (hysterical, self-deprecating, insightful, identifiable) and the recipes are fabulous.  The recipes are a nice mix of vegetarian, non-veg, desserts & sides.  I bought the book after previewing it from the library (and keeping the library's copy far too long, which must mean that I really wanted my own copy).  If you're a fan of Deb's website -- or a fan of great cooking -- this book is a worthy purchase.
B0063GORYU|2.0|I bought another game of solitaire games that also had Spider and that I like much better.  I've removed this version from my Kindle.  I prefer the much more challenging two deck version.
B00992CF6W|3.0|Hey everyone! It's Clayton Wellington with another app review. I am a big fan of Minecraft, but after playing Minecraft PC edition and Xbox 360 edition, I learned how unprofessional pocket edition is. Your probably thinking: &quot;Clay, Minecraft is made out of square pixels! Of course it's not professional!&quot; And your right, but it could be designed better. One error I hate in the app is the fact that you have the in-game disability to see far out in your Minecraft world, making it difficult to see giant formations if it's out of your vision radius. Also, in creative mode you can't select simple items like flint and steel. Other than a few other disappointments, I do recommend this app to creative builders who have an interest in architectural business.
B008HK3XOU|5.0|I absolutely love my Kindle and, therefore, what to keep it in one piece.  I love this cover since I can flip it all the way back when using it.  It's nice and sturdy and I don't worry about anything happening to the screen when the cover is closed.  I like the red, so I it's easier to see where the Kindle is since I use it all over the house.
B00881VLCE|5.0|This is a great game and I give it a 5 rating<br />I have a great time when it comes to these games and my brother does to
B0055SWM08|3.0|The reviews for this game were so high that I thought it would be spellbinding and lots of fun.  For some people maybe it is.  I certainly didn't get addicted as many of the reviewers indicated.  It is nice to have as an alterative for game playing on my Kindle.
B008N1V11U|5.0|this game couldn't be much better people. you play similar to arkham city of course arkham city is better but for a tablet this is damn near perfection. I got this game for my son and have been playing it myself. sometimes the flying is a little radical because of the speed slow it down to a glide add a few more devastating power attacks and its perfect. still giving you 5 stars cuz this games well worth the money great job by gameloft.
B000JK8OYU|4.0|My husband and I ordered this after watching the DVD of the making of the Las Vegas show.  We were both amazed by the good sound and clarity of the music and how George Martin and his son spliced the different songs together.  My son, on the other hand, hates what was done to the music, as he is a stubborn music purist.  So if you never want to hear the Beatles change the music, don't buy this,  But, if you are open to a new kind of Beatle album,  get this one.
B004OFWLO0|5.0|Great double CD with the 2 main recording sessions and other versions. Great to compare the 2 recordings. The grandfather of modern guitar blues!!!
B008KRBTU0|5.0|This was a gift for our grandson.  He is autistic but is learning well.  This is one of the things his mother uses to help him to communicate better.
B007GCY8FS|4.0|A good read...  A couple nice twists!  Definitely thought it worth the money!  Enjoy, enjoy, (five more words required) enjoy!  There!
0525478817|4.0|This was a great book, but 5 seems a bit much. The book did make me cry, which is a feat. The story is simple and moving, but just lacked the depth I would like to see. If the quality of a book is how easily it can make you cry, then this is a solid 5.
B008JFUTT0|5.0|This is the documentary of how Sixto Rodriquez, a singing star in South Africa, believed dead, was discovered in Detroit, and went to that country and performed for huge crowds who loved him.  To see the crowds go wild for him was amazing and emotional.  Someone likened it to having Elvis come to life and sing again.  He lived and raised his family in Detroit in near poverty, took his daughters to museums and concerts, did dirty, hard manual labor to make a living, all the while his records were selling hundreds of thousands of copies, for which he never saw a penny.  He's always humble and down to earth in spite of the adulation showered on him.  I wish he had been shown more in the film.  He's an educated, articulate man, and I would like to hear more of what he has to say.  I couldn't stop the tears from running down my face; it was a flood.  Don't miss this movie.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|I hated this book because it was boring and didn't help at all because it only showed 1 word per page
B009UX2YAC|4.0|The game Subway Suffers is a great game. It is exciting and it keeps you wanting to play it. I would recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun game to play.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Loved this book as I do nearly all John Grisham·s work. The ending was a great surprise. If you like mysteries you will love The Racketeer.
B008966SLM|5.0|What I like about The Robert Cray Band is they create there own genre. Nobody else in the music industry quite sounds like them. Another masterpiece from Dr.Cray!
B000683VI4|5.0|I love this movie, when valentine's day came up I decided to get it. I cried and smiled, but it is one of my favorite movies of all time.
B0097NGUJG|5.0|I found this through an online record store that sells electronic dance music. I liked the clips enough to pay $6 for the cd.<br />This music is great. It's a complete album by every definition. From start to finish - the whole is greater than the sum of it's parts.<br />I think it's getting a little more attention from the indie rock side of things and Silver Linings Playbook doesn't hurt that.<br />Now it sells for $2.99, what a joke.<br /><br />I'd call it guitar music but it does have a synthesized feel. Actually no need to describe, low risk - high reward. Go ahead and spend your coffee money on this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|everyone needs to get this free app. it works great on my kindle fire.since I got this app I read my Bible even more.
0307744434|2.0|So let me recap what I thought this book would be:<br />Magic! Romance! Circuses! Duels! \\"Rich and seductive prose!\\"<br /><br />Well.<br /><br />I guess I got the last one.<br /><br />I would say this book is about 95% exposition (albeit cool, Tim Burton meets Baz Luhrmann descriptions), 2% plot, and 3% plot holes. So if you like books where nothing ever happens, then this is totally for you.<br /><br />Go ahead and give the back of the book plot synopsis a read. This is possibly one of the most disingenuous synopses I've ever read. Celia and Marco are bound to compete in a \\"fierce competition,\\" and have been \\"trained since birth expressly for this purpose.\\" Well, yes. I suppose technically they are, but this fierce competition takes place over sixteen years, and it's really just like a one-up contest. Celia makes something, so Marco makes something else. Sometimes they will even add on to each other's stuff. I've never heard of a \\"fierce competition\\" like that. And then, over the course of this \\"duel\\" they \\"tumble headfirst into love.\\" Well, again, yes. Technically. Really, though, the romance is all of the sudden there, but it was hard to really believe in the characters because it was like Morgenstern used her characters as a backdrop for the circus. Yes, you read that correctly. This is one of those rare novels where the characters come second to the setting. It's hard to give much more of a plot synopsis because this is a book you finish and sit there and just say, \\"Huh?\\" There were so many things I didn't like.<br /><br />First of all, if you're a writer and you have a story that isn't interesting enough to be told in one chronological storyline, then that should be a hint right there that your novel blows. For example, this book's chapters go something like this: you're in London (1892), picture yourself in a circus in Germany (1900), watch Celia and Marco in Paris (1899), talk about characters you know nothing about in Prague (1901), head back to 1892 to hear about baby Marco getting trained (London), back with characters you vaguely think you recall being mentioned before (Dublin, 1894), back to the future with a boy who has nothing to do with the circus (Boston, 1900), and on and on ad nauseum.<br /><br />All of this jumping around seems to promise that at some point, all of these characters and story lines will intertwine. Well, they do, and it all makes (a little bit of) sense about 33 novel-years after the start of the book. And let's not even go into the stupid deus ex machina ending that Morgenstern pulled out of her butt to make sure everyone lives happily ever after. The worst part is, I think I would read another novel by Erin Morgenstern just because her writing is so soft and fluid. If only she had a point to make...

B005CRQ4OW|5.0|This book is hilarious, and an easy read. Everyone should read it, no matter your age. I plan on reading them all.
B009HOU672|5.0|This recomposition by Max Richiter is very beautiful and amazing. He combines the Baroque mood with very contemporary sensations. He changes tone and notes in some parts, while continuing Vivaldi's baroque pathetique! Subtle sadness and passion, which were characteristics of Vivaldi himself, and the emotion which cannot be expressible in words are flourishing throughout the 'Four Season'. Love this album so much!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game. It is very addicting and fun,but when I first got it it took about a half a hour to load. Otherwise it is an awesome game.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this Is the most awesome game ever but I also bated it its has a picture of a sexual monkey. chaseing a human
B009VYAVTG|5.0|This is one of the best series so far. The Sword in the Stone parts 1 & 2 are terrrfic..  The Blu-ray is magnificant. The picture and audio are great. Wish all the previous series had Blu-ray at the time I purchased them  I saw the final series on line from England. As of this review it's showing on SyFy. This final series comes out on Blu-ray in April thru Amizon. You must get it The acting of these three young actors is truly great. Colin will make you cry in the last episode. It is very very touching. Nice to see Colin Morgan win the NTA award for best dramtic actor. I met Colin last July at Comic-con. Was lucky to talk to him one on one. What a great young man he is. Told him he is a teriffic actor and he thanked me. This series is very good and the next final series is exceptional. It's great entertainment for the whole family. Not many TV shows today are.  Merlin is the best entertainment a family can have. Buy it! You won't regreat it.

B009IQ0TGM|4.0|This album is great and got it for a steal on sale. This albums has great songs. My favorites are Anything Could Happen, Lights, and Figure 8. However, some songs just don't match the awesomeness of others. Overall it's a great album 4.5/5

B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Wonderful story that takes captivates the reader into the story like you are right there.  Very real and not over the top.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I loved this album back in 2008 (I was late to the party) I don't really listen to it anymore but I felt like all the songs were touching and meaningful to me at the time.

B008LC8TJI|5.0|this is my new favorite album. maroon five and adam levine make musical magic on this cd and i'm not even a huge fan of this genre of music tending to stick to more alternative music. but the melodies and beats you will not be able to get out of your head.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Much more fun and challenging than regular solitaire and easy to change your preferences.  A true joy to play and share.
B000L53D4O|5.0|my nephew doesn't walk yet, but we collapsed the walking part and he just uses his fine motor skills to play with all the toys on top. this is a great first toy... no parts to lose, great fine motor development and eventually he will use it to learn how to walk. almost :)
B0055S348W|5.0|I absolutely loved this program.  It allowed me to do something I couldn't do on my phone before.  Print.  Sounds simple enough, and it was.  Using it is simple, easy to set up, and does exactly what it promises to do.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed playing this game. The puzzles were fun. It also had a great storyline. I have enjoyed several G5 games.
B004YXE438|3.0|This is a great time killer.  It will pass the time, but that is about it.  There is really no challenge to it.
B00005JM02|5.0|Was happy to find it for the kids since our's had been scratched.  We enjoy the movie and missed watching it.
B005LAII8K|5.0|I am a huge lover of the Sci-Fi genre.  Books, movies, games, you name it.  I really wanted to see Looper in the theaters, but I had to pass due to financial reasons.  So the first moment I had some extra money, I snagged this up on Blu-Ray.<br /><br />This is a stunning movie that not only has some moments of action, the movie is not based on action at all.  I was pleasantly surprised by just how thought provoking it was.  There is grit, action, and brains to this movie.  The characters are strong, believable, and you want to follow each of them on their path.<br /><br />I won't give away the ending.  But my wife didn't like it.  Personally, I thought it was a great ending to this movie.  Not only did it tie up the plot nicely, it showed growth in the main character.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|This movie is awesome and I would recommend this to anybody who likes action or suspense or just great movies in general.
B004MNO0BQ|3.0|This is a basic table hockey game.  I like it, but sometime the touch interface would glitch and the paddles wouldn't move.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I would have given 3 1/2 stars if available. I'm enjoying playing the game but some screens are difficult to see and when you try to enlarge the screen( if available) it often causes you to choose a wrong item then you get a penalty. Also the flashlight is hard to move while screen is enlarged and sometimes you choose the right item but if you don't tap it exactly right again you get a penalty. Also there are items at the top and unless you enlarge you can't see them they get cut off.

B00AFEXRME|4.0|Akin to cancer, there are no rules when it comes to alcoholism. Victims come from every background. By the time the epiphany takes place -- \\"I am an alcoholic,\\" -- there's usually a huge wake of subtle destruction in the rear view mirror. What happens in \\"Flight,\\" director Robert Zemeckis' harrowing 2012 film, is anything but subtle. Denzel Washington plays airline pilot \\"Whip\\" Whitaker, a likable veteran who arrives at the airport after a night of booze and cocaine. He wears sunglasses and stumbles as he boards the jet airliner with more than 100 souls. He requests black coffee and Advil and his young co-pilot (Brian Geraghty) gives him a troubled stare. Maybe he has the flu.<br /><br />It's not a spoiler when I say the airplane's going to crash, as the scenes are heavily emphasized in the trailer. After contemplation, I realized multiple incidents taking place before the crash are open to interpretation. Whip decides to fly through a violent thunderstorm much to his co-pilot's consternation. Certainly not the product of sober thinking, was such reckless behavior a contributing factor to what eventually happens? There's a loud metallic bang, and suddenly the airliner is nose-diving for the ground.<br /><br />Everything that happens during the beginning of \\"Flight\\" is plausible. We are familiar with Sully Sullenberger's miraculous landing of his crippled airliner on the Hudson River. There's also the 2000 tragedy of Alaska Airlines Flight 261, suffering an identical malfunction as the plane of this film. What pilots attempted in an effort to halt a dive is exactly what Whip achieves. It's an incredibly unorthodox maneuver which could only have been accomplished because he was under the influence. Okay, that's as far as I'm going on the crash, suffice to say it's one of the most extraordinary scenes ever devised.<br /><br />Zemickis has forged a unique résumé  over the years marked by experimentation and respectable gloss. He gave us the hilarious cult classic [[ASIN:B004INJ7GI Used Cars (1980)]], followed closely by [[ASIN:B003AQCV08 Back to the Future Trilogy [Blu-ray]]]. His high mark was the American fable [[ASIN:B0035JRVBO Forrest Gump]], which won him the Academy Award. He gave us another fable with the wonderful [[ASIN:B0026O475M Cast Away]]. \\"Flight,\\" his most serious film, is arguably his least commercial. It too is a fable, replete with demonic tapping and the haunting siren call of a refrigerator possessing glistening bottles of vodka.<br /><br />Saying Washington gives a great performance is redundant, as he never gives a bad performance. His undeniable gifts are coolly reminiscent of Spencer Tracy, Cary Grant, or more recently Jack Nicholson. Whip Whitaker is one of the greatest roles of his career. He's chunky, in need of a shave and on the verge of a breakdown. He repeatedly awakens with a hangover, quickly striding to the kitchen to pour the remaining liquor down the drain. The hangover wears off, and his coffee table is soon covered with beer bottles. He begins a tentative relationship with Nicole (Kelly Reilly), a recovered heroin addict. She tries to help him attend an Alcoholics Anonymous meeting. In the immortal reaction of all alcoholics, he uncomfortably sits in the back and leaves early.<br /><br />\\"Flight\\" is a brave film dealing with a serious subject, though one wonders if the airliner crash was the hook allowing it to be financed. I admit I enjoyed details involving the investigation, including the political machinations of a lawyer (Don Cheadle) and union rep (Bruce Greenwood) as they attempt to hide Whip's failed toxicology report. Slowly, Whip achieves his epiphany, though in a forum so public I found it unconvincing. Call me cynical, but I don't believe Washington's character would announce his sickness in such a manner. Epiphanies take place in a jail cell, or hard Sunday mornings on the bathroom floor.<br /><br />In spite of its symbolism, not to mention comedic forays with John Goodman as drug dealer Harlan Mays (who knows, maybe the devil does wear a Hawaiian shirt), \\"Flight\\" has moments of overwhelming truth. I knew a friend who turned his life around after viewing [[ASIN:B000I5UYTE Clean and Sober]], the brilliant and underrated 1988 film starring Michael Keaton. While \\"Flight\\" is not on the same level of gritty greatness, if it inspires just one person to become sober, it has achieved profound importance.
B004EBZX6W|1.0|IT doesn't do anything the wifi in my phone doesn't already do.  I don't really see the point of the app.
B0051ANPZQ|4.0|I loved WONDER. Mrs. Patten, our teacher, did WONDER as a read-a-loud. WONDER is about August Pullman, a fifth grader with facial deformities. It captures tears and cheers, which our class did both. It talks about August's journey through fifth grade, and for him, it is quite exhilarating. He runs into the mean, popular kid, Julian Albans, and trustful pupils, such as Summer and Jack Will. August is treated as if he has disease that students who hang out with him or touch him and more susceptible to. The disease is called &#34;Plague.&#34; Soon, Jack is treated like an oddity, too. Julian is able to turn many, many people around. In the end, August is happily treated like everyone else, and gets and award for turning around the most hearts. The most exciting part is during fifth grade camps.<br />Why did I give WONDER only 4 stars when I love it so much? Because I did not understand some parts, such as when August's sister Via's boyfriend Justin was speaking. Another reason is because no fifth grader speaks the way they do. At least, not in California.<br />I hope that R. J. Palacio will take what I am saying into consideration and I would LOVE another book about Auggie in sixth grade. That would be quite interesting. This book was fabulous!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'd heard this was a great \\"murder mystery\\" book, but it was really so much more. It took me a few chapters to really get sucked in, but once I was t by ere was no going back. This book was gripping in a way I never could have imagined. Amazing on so many levels.

B00BB8RKH6|3.0|I love Denzel Washington as an actor but this movie was just ok. It has potential but really felt like a public service announcement at the end. That was disappointing.
B004QX07G4|5.0|This books sounds just like her. You feel like is reading it to you. Wonderful and funny. Would recommend to anyone who needs a great laugh.
B006G3MZRQ|5.0|This film is gripping, the storyline is easy to follow, and keeps you the edge of your seat. This has easily become one of the best fighting movies I have ever seen. This will definitely become part of my film collection. Great film, a definite recommendation.
B007REV4T8|3.0|I'm concerned about this one.  I bought it as a gift but the packaging was horrible.  An envelope does not protect from the force of other packages and mail being thrown on it and the envelope was torn.  It is a gift for someone's birthday so I can't open it.  I just hope that it is not broken or cracked.
0321544080|5.0|Joe has been my favorite photographer since reading his book. I am a 15year pro. I emulate his work! Buy this book!
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|Calculator plus is a great option for a kindle fire.  Easy to use with no problems.  I would recommend this app if you are looking for a calculator!
1455502758|5.0|Hitchens writes coherently and poignantly. The thoughts regarding one's own mortality can't be easy to articulate.  Yet despite illness Hitchins does just that .
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Well, I'm reviewing the book before I read the book.  I just came back from seeing the movie and it was so good!  I have no doubt the book is as good as the movie.  The movie was a tearjerker, but it was a good tearjerker. :)  And Josh Duhamel is handsome as h_ _ _!  Sorry Fergie!  Okay I have finished and I am speechless!  Mr. Sparks has truly written a heartfelt book and at which point had me in tears.  Katie/Erin and Alex will truly be happy.  Sometimes we need to use our imaginations to guide us and to help us get through whatever it is we're dealing with.  Wow, Carly Jo!!
B00846F1YW|5.0|This is a very fun and entertaining game.  It is a fun hidden object game with little puzzles.  Don't start paying unless you have some time to kill. You will be playing over an hour before you realize it.
0547848412|5.0|We got this for our grand-son for his birthday. He really enjoyed the story. I plan to borrow this from him and read it myself.
B007JOM0GC|5.0|This is a great album.  The recording I downloaded was perfect.  There were no problems at all.  Couldnt be happier.
B000Q6GX5Y|3.0|This was purchased as a gift for a family member. I cannot personally rate this product, but the member that received it really enjoyes it.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|If you enjoy Castle, you'll love reading Richard Castle's story.  It made me feel like I was watching the show all over again.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|That's all I could say after I finished this amazing book!<br /><br />I read Delirium, the first book in this series, and enjoyed it, but not nearly as much as this book. In my opinion, the second book is better! After you read Delirium you have to read Pandemonium.<br /><br />As Pandemonium reels you back and forth from past to present, you will get overwhelmingly caught between two stories of Lena's survival in the Wild and in the city. While the cold, hard truth of living in the Wilds caves in around Lena, the city wraps her in a mystery and imprisons her.<br /><br />It's a book you can't put down. I finished it in two days!<br /><br />The best part is the story continues in a third book! :D
0345410025|5.0|This book is full of tricks to improve memory.  If you let your imagination run freely with the words or names that need memorizing they'll be harder to forget because you've just created a storyline full of visual stimulus... the author gives examples but encourages you to use your own imagination.  Play along and reap the benefits later.  I'm back in school and so thankful for finding this gem!
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|this game was very well done,my wife and I spent a lot of time working on getting through it,we look forward to more like this
B008P9M614|5.0|I love house and so dose my wife if u are looking for every single episode of house in one convent package this is what you need.
B0063GORYU|4.0|Yes I like it.  I play it more on my computer than on my kindle but I<br />do use it
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I think this  game is pretty good the graphics are okey and the people are over priced it is ok
B0063IH60K|4.0|I play this game when I just want to relax and need to veg a little when the day gets a little<br />stressful.
B006BDHAX0|5.0|I love mahjong and this app is awesome. There are a lot of different levels. This was definitely the best money i spent on an app.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This is an addicting game - lot's of fun.  I find the games quite challenging.  This is the first<br />time I had played the game - grandkids play it all the time on their I-pods.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|A sequel equal in comparison to the first. Martin grabs your attention from the start and won't let go. Definitely a book I would bring out when \\"winter is coming.\\"
B009UX2YAC|5.0|All I have to say is get the app because it is the best!!!!!!!!!<br />Once you get it, you will NEVER forget it!!!!
B008EKOO46|4.0|One needs to read books like Jared Diamonds to better understand that we Americans are not the only society in the world that contributes to the betterment of humanity.
B008PQ8XZK|5.0|Having read Kate Morton's other books, I was eager to get into this one.<br />From the start it had me intrigued.  I found myself both loving and hating the main character (Dolly)- couldn't reconcile her children's version of her as their mom, with the Dolly of the war years.<br /><br />I later discovered why - that was the twist in the tale.  Typical of Kate Morton, the twist emerged almost at the end of the story, keeping me engaged all the way.<br /><br />A very satisfying read.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|Dont need something better. Very good job for a free game. Surely I suggest it in your library apps. Have a nice time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is really awesome!<br /><br />I love it!<br /><br />It is awesome on my kindle fire HD.<br /><br />You should totally get it.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|I thought this game was way better than another Angry Birds game that there ever was. The more intricate bird characteristics help you keep interested, unlike the Angry Birds Rio game(that by the way was the worst thing ever).
1423151054|5.0|This is a very good way to get a first hand approach to the work of some of the greatest animators in the medium. A must for any Disney fan.
B006LSZECO|3.0|This book kept you reading.  I enjoyed the emotional up and down.  Couldn't put it down. This was a great read.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Well, the realism portrayed by Suzanne Collins is enough to make me contemplate therapy.  It is a disturbing world she has created.  While a fiction novel, it is not merely a fiction novel.  I recognize many parallels with our world.  It has definitely given me long fits of thinking.  In short, this is why we read books, isn't it?  However, to have one this good is rare.  In fact the story is wonderfully thought provoking and is appropriate for anyone over 12 years old.  I have read this book twice now, and the whole series once.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I loved this book! If you like other John Green books I would highly recommend reading it! Great, original story.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I can't stop playing this game; fun and challenging if you want it to be.  Great game for all ages; works very well on Kindle Fire.
B003ODIZL6|1.0|The book wasn't that good because it doesn't tell you if  the word has a long vowel or a short vowel.
B000EHSVSC|5.0|A great movie without all the cgi  good old fashion movie making.  A stellar list of stars, second to none acting a must have for any movie buff. I've  visited pearl many times and as a vetern of the Viet nam war,  the lives lost that day was amazing and how they died was horrible.  How many of our men were alive in those ships that sunk for several hours to several days , alone in the darkness the water all around them.  They were right when they said they  &#34; awoke a sleeping  giant &#34;  As a vet I want to thank all our men and women in harm's way, welcome home ou vets and to say  Rest in peace  to all the brave men and women  to die at Preal, a well deserved  R I P  .......
0385535147|4.0|Fans of John Grisham will recognize this as being in the main of his style -- a book where the law and legal system are the fulcrum upon which the tale grows from and turns.<br /><br />Though not concerned with great issues of society or justice as the author plumbed in The Chamber and A Time To Kill, this book does offer a commentary on the government's aggressive of the RICO statute and the severity of sentencing in the federal system.<br /><br />Malcolm Bannister is a first rate character as are a couple of the criminals he interacts with.  The story is told in Bannister's first person pespective when he is present in the scene - and in the third person when he is not.  Bannister, a federal prisoner locked away in a country-club prison is rightly mad about his conviction.  A model prisoner, he is biding his time until he gets the gift of knowledge that will help solve the murder of a federal judge.  He has a deal in mind.  But the seemingly straight-fowrard story is anything but as plot twists emerge from Grisham's fertil mind to take the reader on a trip that unfolds clever schemes and interesting characters  Without giving detail that could ruin the plot, I would definately recommend this for fans of the author's legal thrillers.  Though not as wholly focused on the law as some of his other books, this book combines interesting aspects of the federal correctional and justice system that gives form a narrative that moves.  An enjoyable read.
B0053VKP8S|5.0|I have used this device for a while and am very impressed.  It does exactly what it says and I even have it powered off of a Uverse Box's USB port.<br /><br />Perfect for feeding analog audio from my Apple TV to my Receiver.
B005LAJ17M|1.0|I thought that seeing the shows in sequence was very good as you did not lose the what was going on.  I look forward to the next season.  This is spy thriller that relates to possible real world situations.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I love it. It works!!!!!!!! Smartest thing ever for you mobile device! It really helps to know how much battery you have left before your device randomly shut down!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Amazing.... I could not put this book down. There is no need to say much more, you won't want it to end. This will be a book you can read over and over and you'll love it a little more each time! I can't wait for the next one!
B0060ANZ2Y|5.0|I bought this as a replacement for my old lp. I haven't played it for quite some time and it brought back memories.
0066620996|5.0|Wish I could give this to all of my managers VPs and executives. Very informative. Will definitely use these techniques when I'm in charge some day.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|My three year old, ten year old and I all love this game! It's like Mario Bros for NES. So much fun to play.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|Man you really don't know how heavy this kuh-nife is until it's in your hands! (that's what she said!).  Anyways, I reviewed the hell out of six different forums (thanks bladeforum.com!) and decided to buy it due to it's indestructability, versatility and price.<br /><br />Versatility depends on the users hands and lack of bitchin'.  Many complaints are because it doesn't produce fine-cuts or fillet an effin goldfish, but if you have the patience and some decent skills it'll get the job done.  Also, there's plenty of space inside the hollow handles and you can fit a few survival items inside them.  Plus for that, but minus on the texture of the handles...your call.<br /><br />Price was the final deal sealer.  It's ALOT more blade than the rest of it's peers in the same category...and times are tough.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|Good action, another fine movie in the series,  I streamed this through Amazon Instant video and it was convenient and worth the cost.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I love minecraft but we need to UPDATE it, plus I think they should add animals and monsters to the creative. I suggest getting this game, although they need an update!
B003TSEL7S|5.0|I rated this book five stars because i love thes books i just finished the second book i read the percy jackson books and i loved it and i eould recomend it to others because if you like the greek gids this is a good series to read and the percy jackson series
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This is a long book but well written.  Makes you think about what might have happened if someone could change history.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Books always seem better than the movie, I recently watched the movie and I had myself wonder what the three fingers in the air meant. I rented the book and six days went by and I realized I fell in love with this book. Books explain more in details, this book was really good. I definitely recommend it.
B000AOA2G8|5.0|Unpacked the Park HCW-4 from Amazon and had the bottom bracket on an old early 90s Raleigh out in about 5 min.<br />Just remember Right(side)is Left(backward threaded)AND Left(side)is Right(standard threaded). That and a three day soak with 50/50 acetone/automatic transmission fluid.(or your favorite 'break free').<br />The right tools make for an easy job (;<br />DB
B000SO7OL6|5.0|This is a great cd and we never get sick of listening to it. We also saw her in concert in Australia. She is a remarkable performer.
B00004W221|5.0|Rudy is an inspiring, true story of a young man with a dream and the naysayers and encouragers he encountered along the way.  I highly recommend it!
1603420398|5.0|My wife stated that see really &#34;LOVES&#34; this book. A happy wife is just great. She said it has alot of great patterns and ideas.
B005CRQ2DK|4.0|I love this book as much as I love my brother. Who's with me?Please describe this book at the bottom
B003O86FMW|5.0|This book reminds me of the resent headlines. The political powers that be would like nothing more then to take our Rights away from us to own guns. Just because of the resent shootings. Truth is stranger than fiction. I could not put this book down. If you buy it, plan on doing nothing but reading. Because you won't put it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|its really awesome and cool and fun and the best game I ever played I love that game I wonder I there coming out with a new one
B00846F1YW|3.0|Very frustrating when objects are behind the border! Some shapes are extremely vague making it difficult to see what it is. The author really missed a great chance to reward the player by actually using the solved puzzles to progress the game.<br /><br />This is my first time with a game like this. I am about 3/4 of the way through.
B00AI5AQPQ|3.0|Nice book. I liked the way how Matilda was so clever and are good friends with her classmates and Miss Jennifer Honey.<br />But I do not like the way how Miss Trunchbull treat children like &#34;rats&#34;, Matilda giving revenge on her parents by mixing chemicals, using superglue, and keeping the parrot that Fred had given to Matilda, and Ms Trunchbull by tipping the glass over and using the chalkboard`s chalk and eraser, abandoning child, and also, VIOLENT WORDS or name-calling such as cockroach and shrimp. CHILD ABUSE.<br />However I still recommend this to children, as it may be appropriate, but not name-calling, as it is RUDE. Parents: Please make sure that the child would not learn ba things fron the book.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|I loved this story, as I do most Nicholas Sparks books. I read it in a day because I couldn't put it down. The downfall was the ending. I wanted an epilogue, an extra chapter...something! The last chapter didn't fit the book, in fact I was angered by it because it seemed unreal where the rest of the book could have been a real life story. I don't want to give it away, so you'll have to see what I mean for yourself. Definitely worth reading, and I'm looking forward to seeing the movie.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|Great game. So much fun, and tons of awesome dragons! Cool minigames too! It involves a lot of though. Totally worth it!
B0081HLMD8|5.0|After watching Headhunters for the second time in two months, I feel compelled to review it. I know that most of you will never see it because it's subtitled, and that's a huge shame. I'm not sure how many thousands of movies I have watched over the years, but this may be the most original script I have ever seen. I don't say that lightly, I can assure you.<br /><br />Although I know I must review the movie, I also don't want to tell you anything about it at all. It's too surprising to be ruined by a review that gives away any of its many revelations.<br /><br />So what can I tell you?<br /><br />Roger Brown is 5'6\\" tall and has a wife who is beautiful, successful, and several inches taller than him. She's about to open her own art gallery. He's insecure and almost sure that she'll eventually leave him, so he tries to compensate by giving her expensive gifts and living in a house that is out of his price range. He works as a headhunter, placing people in high-powered jobs, but he supplements his income by stealing paintings.<br /><br />We are shown how Brown carefully uses his main job to select potential targets for his criminal activities. His accomplice, Ove (Sander) works in security, and helps Brown disable alarms. Brown dreams of the day that he steals something valuable enough to enable him to change his life forever, and an opportunity presents itself when Clas Greve (Coster-Waldau) tells Brown's wife that he owns a Rubens.<br /><br />I don't want to reveal any more plot points.<br /><br />Aksel Hennie looks like a more refined version of Steve Buscemi, and has the same sort of charm. Even though he's a criminal, it's hard not to root for him. Some of the situations that he finds himself in are bizarre, but his actions seem logical and intelligent under the circumstances.<br /><br />The movie is based on Jo Nesbø's novel. I sometimes watch successful movies, such as Avatar, and sit there wondering how such a predictable plot ever ended up being made into a movie. I'm certain that I could do better. But if I had written Headhunters, I would be extremely proud. You won't be able to predict many of the twists and turns taken by this plot. It's nothing short of genius.<br /><br />I saw some great films in 2012, but even though there was a Tarantino release, and several others worth 4.5 or 5/5, I don't think anything surpassed Headhunters in terms of sheer enjoyment. If you are open to subtitled films, this is a must. If you aren't, maybe this can be your first. An American remake appears to be scheduled for next year. Your other choice is to learn Norwegian. It would almost be worth the effort.movie. I'm certain that I could do better. But if I had written Headhunters, I would be extremely proud.

B009VMN3RA|5.0|This is a very sad story in which neither parent is interested in loving or nurturing this child.  Although there wasn't a lot of physical abuse, there was extreme neglect and emotional abuse by both parents.  Rather than break off from her mother, she still keeps coming back only to be kicked again.  Her mother is too self-centered to ever come around to seeing how much her daughter needs her love, nurturing and encouragement.  I'm sure her mom is furious about this book and probably has convinced herself that it's all lies and she was a great mother.  If it ruins the relationship, no big loss, in my opinion.  I'm glad to know she has her husband and kids with whom she can have real family relationships.  I wish Sachi every success.
B0090P98Z4|3.0|Absolutely great game, but needs to be updated with the features that are available on the iphone version.That would make this five stars easily.  Otherwise, being capped at lvl 51 keeps this game mediocre at best.
B00A6N8F4Y|1.0|just absolutely the pits beginning to end - nothing at all interesting or entertaining about this almost &#34;B&#34; movie -
0547391005|5.0|We used to check this book out at the library but then decided we needed our own copy for home. The stories are long (like two or three mini stories in one), and my 4-year-old is captivated the entire time (even when he's telling me what's going to happen next).<br /><br />It's a nice change from the \\"updated\\" Curious George (though we enjoy those stories as well). But be warned: the older stories contain content that probably wouldn't pass in new stories presented in today's society; where its okay to remove a monkey from his natural habitat, open a bottle of ether, and \\"accidentally\\" call the police.<br /><br />Still, it's CLASSIC Curious George, and as a parent it takes me back to when I was a kid (and the \\"no-nos\\" are just used as teaching opportunities). We thoroughly enjoy it.
B000NQRE9Q|5.0|FINALLY...all 4 Indy films are offered together in one set on Blu-Ray!  The transfer looks pretty amazing in high-def, the menus are professionally designed and nice to look at, and the sound quality is excellent on my Bose home theater system.  Lots of special features will keep you watching for hours!  Only gripe:  my first copy I got had a bad disc in it that wouldn't play in ANY player.  A friend of mine had the same issue and we both had to return our copies for replacements.  Make sure you test all of your discs when you get them to ensure that they all work, as it appears there were some bad pressings on the initial first-run release of this set.<br /><br />Sure, Indy 4 was a (arguably) a debacle, but the other 3 films are timeless and deserve to be watched in such high-quality as this.  Well worth the money!
1451695195|5.0|Great book!  The author, a neurosurgeon knowledgeable in the anatomy and workings of the brain, uses medical facts to prove  his point.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I found that the writing of this done as a matter of fact, almost news documentary way, to be refreshing. Treating such a bizarre impossible topic in that way was entertaining. It afforded me a means of suspending credibility necessary to truly get into the book.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Gripping movie that reminds of the power of addiction and the intentionally of repentance and forgiveness. I am left speechless.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It does exactly what it says and exactly what I need. I recommend.<br />It's easy to use and uncomplicated. You won't regret it. If u do....it's free, no harm done
B006LSZECO|4.0|Twists and turns galore.  Loved every minute of the toxic relationship.  It makes you wonder if all marriages are really like theirs.<br />A real page turner.
B002I9Z8B2|4.0|Enjoyed this classic very much one of my favorite Star Trak movies. Would be interested when some of the other go on sale.
B00A77II0U|5.0|Very entertaining! Many hours of fun. Plenty of different levels. Good hints if you need them. Great hidden object games. Highly recommend. Worth the 2.99 price.
B00846F1YW|3.0|I trudged through all 22 levels seeking reasons for this game's high rating; enlightenment eluded me. It feels like an elegant version of Where's Waldo.<br /><br />As far as games go, the graphics were very good and the controls were intuitive. No real knock on the game. I just don't get it.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|This is the kind of historical fiction I crave. So many different facets to keep the reader going forward and wanting more.
B0085P2Z6E|3.0|I was truly enjoying this game until I reached the level (I think 8) where you had to look for things with a &quot;spotlight&quot;.  Unfortunately,  what was a challenge became ridiculous because the spotlight &quot;snapped&quot; to my finger so that I couldn't find anything since the visible part was now under my fingertip.  I got so frustrated I eventually quit and see no point in continuing.  Make the spot bigger or let me drag it by the edge.  The way it is set up currently is not useable.
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game, good hints and mini games within! Loved the great graphics. Sound effects were excellent too. Very enjoyable game. I had a hard time putting it down!
B0056AP65I|2.0|I received everything in good time.The major complaint I have is that it is promoted as pencils with SHARPENER, and that was the main reason I bought these mechanical pencils. With great disappointment there is no sharpener.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|I LOVED THE MOVIE. IT ARRIVED IN GOOD CONDITION. I WOULD RECOMMEND IT FOR PEOPLE THAT LIKE THESE TYPES OF MOVIES.
B006LSZECO|2.0|Wow that was a serious waste of a read. I thought there was gonna 'Be some climatic ending and it just ended on a very odd note. Not my favorite!!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|this is the best game ever I loved it and it works great on the kindle fire the tilt is s little slow but this is still a better game than the original temple run
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|This blu-ray of Lawrence of Arabia is outstanding. The picture is vibrant and clear. The new transfer has done this film justice in a way that has never been achieved before. This must be the best it has ever looked on screen. The film itself is an epic masterpiece, and is highly recommended for anyone interested in classic cinema, epic film making, grand & sweeping landscapes, intriguing characters, and beautiful music.
B009SJ3GUK|5.0|I really love this show. I am disappointed that it only runs one day (twice over) then will run the new episode with the re-run afterwards. It's backwards and I hate it so I spent the cash to watch it in the proper order. This episode was really awesome though so I don't mind having it forever.
B002BCNK1Q|5.0|being asian myself, clint did a great job in depicting the lives of hmongs...the character that he plays might have been seen as a racist at first, but his growing relationship with them and his last actions prove otherwise...i'm not sure if i'm a clint eastwood fan, but this movie really touched me.
B006X415GK|4.0|She's really pretty. Love the black and white theme of this doll and sort of wish more would turn to the grayscale theme.
B000SW2ER2|5.0|An Art Sci Fi that is less kablam more quiet.  A psychologist  is dispatched into space on a solo rescue effort to look in on a crew aboard a spacecraft, problem solve,  and bring them back down to earth.  The psychologist is supposed to help and problem solve, though, in the events that transpire, he is barely able to help himself.  He is assigned following on the heels of of difficult events and disappearances aboard the spacecraft.  Upon boarding the craft,  things unravel.  He begins to have mysterious interactions  with a being that looks and acts just like his late wife that defy any rational explanation.  His interactions, seemingly real, are  direct, tactile, auditory and sensory interactions, in his view.  Realer than hallucinations, but impossible as she had died some time before.  Who knows.  Justifiably shaken, each time he tried to rid himself of her,  the space dimension is teeming with copies of her that reappear after his attempts.  A more objective crewmember tells him to vanquish the apparition once and for all.  Is Reincarnation or life arisen from death real?  This movie seems to wholeheartedly assert yes. Brilliant, and thought provoking.
B00846REIS|4.0|Good love story with sweet romance. Just a bit too much like5p shades of grey  Will read others books as well
B00846F1YW|5.0|Is a good game and Nit very additive game. Would recommend it to any one . It the most ammazing puzzle game.
0920668372|4.0|When the book came out in the early 90's I was a Pre-school teacher.  Our CEO came back from a conference and read it to all of us in a meeting.  Most of us had tears during the reading and I remember thinking that the book would be more meaningful to us as mothers than to a young child. Never the less, I bought it for my daughter who I believed would understand it. She fell in love with it! She thought it was a sweet book about the unconditional love between a Mother and child.  She loved it and has never forgotten it.  The reason I'm about to purchase the book again is because it made such an important impression on my daughter that she's just called to ask me if I could try to find it for her two daughters. I should add that it's still one of my favorite books as well.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|I really like this game. I have played it on PC and now on my Kindke Fire HD. The last levels are challenging and require both strategyand a bit of luck to beat. Charming  story, too.  Highly recommended.

1423113462|5.0|I thought I'd share my son's comments on Rick Riordan's books...  My son has been reading Rick Riordan's books for quite a while.  We have five children and all of them love the books, usually reading each one multiple times.  My 11-year-old is re-reading The Lost Hero right now.  He came to me this morning and said, &#34;There is only one problem with Rick Riordan's books.&#34;<br /><br />I asked what's the problem and he said, &#34;They are so interesting that I stay up all night reading!&#34;<br /><br />As a parent, I am grateful for high quality books geared toward young people with higher reading levels.  These books are not &#34;dumbed down&#34; as so many books are today.  Riordan is not afraid to use vocabulary intended to stimulate kids' brains, yet the content of the stories is completely appropriate for younger readers.  (My kids are ages 9 to 16 and we're very picky about not allowing them to read what we call &#34;trash&#34; or just a bunch of &#34;fluff.&#34;)<br /><br />We will continue to buy copies of every book this author can write.<br />Sonya Haskins
B008OOYALE|5.0|This game is fun and addictive. I've been playing for a few days and I have a hard time putting it down.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so amazing it's UN real !!!!!!!!!!!!!!! You should get. This game<br />!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I give it 10 gold Stars out of 10
B004QZ9PLU|3.0|Great story but it was a little predictable in places. There didn't seem to be any motive for some characters. They seemed to just be planted in the story for filler.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I love subway surfers is very unique and fun the only thing I would change is putting New maps and get to choose what different maps also you could make it so the person is maybe running next to the subway and instead dodge cars and people. :)
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This game was a good game. The graphics and storyline were good. It was just challenging enough to keep me interested in playing.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I think this game is much better then temple run and better then temple run2 I saw like 10000 people downloaded it I downloaded it to when I started playing it it was so mach fun you must play this cool game<br /><br />Jonathan khusainov

B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a awesome game but the limited time aster is hard to get<br /> And oh yea my favorite movie is rio
B007XIC1GI|1.0|Would have liked more information on relationships with other  celebs. Boring. I couldn't read it all. Ok ok ok ok
B002QE3CTY|5.0|One of the best books I have ever read I suggest you read it you will feel excitement and fright at the same time it is definitely a nail bitter that will keep you on the edge of your seat for day desperately NEEDING the next book it's almost like it you in the story
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|Not bad but little in the way of directions or guidence and punishes you too much for the slighest mistake.<br /><br />I was getting three stars for each level and I skimp past 1 small glob of oil and<br />for that I get no stars?<br /><br />Sorry - it lost my interest there and I quickly uninstalled...
B00AF6B22E|5.0|In many ways, this story is ripped from headline news stories.  You cannot help but think of so many public figures who have failed us and inspired us:  Tiger Woods, Lance Armstrong, Mark McGuire, Kobe Bryant, Michael Jordan, Bill Clinton, Oscar Pistorius.  The list goes on.  By stepping into the public spotlight, it exposed their brilliance and their flaws.  We held them up to a higher standard because we believed.  We found in the end they were just like the rest of us.  They were human.<br /><br />I gave this film a chance because I wondered what the director Bob Zemeckis was up to after having his motion capture studio shut down by Disney after making several mediocre movies that underperformed at the box office.  I once believed that Zemeckis was a master storyteller who could do no wrong:  Back to the Future, Castaway, Forrest Gump, even the okay films like What Lies Beneath and Who Framed Roger Rabbit had appealing stories.<br /><br />After seeing this story unfold on screen, it's clear that very few directors can hold a candle to Zemeckis.  This is a story about redemption.  How you have to lose everything to reclaim your soul.  How you pay for your sins in ways you don't ever expect or imagine.  It is a heartfelt journey that is impossible to look away from.<br /><br />Denzel Washington is in top form.  If you saw his performance in Man on Fire as a bodyguard with an alcohol problem or his Oscar winning role in Training Day, you see how this actor has matured and grown.  It is one of the greatest performances in recent memory.  This is a brilliant, earnest performance.<br /><br />The movie is not perfect.  John Goodman kicks the doors in and in many ways, his comic performance takes us out of the story.  It's distracting unlike his performance in Argo where he stole the show.  At times, it is too much.  Don Cheadle is excellent and understated as a smart union lawyer.  The actor in the stairwell playing a cancer patient is amazing.  The apex of the film happens at the hearing.  I only wish it was a close up on Denzel's face when he says &#34;God Help Me.&#34;<br /><br />I also think some of the characters are underdeveloped.  The NTSB interrogator does not seem scary enough.  Please see a movie called The Verdict with Paul Newman and see how they created a demon with James Mason in only a few scenes.  I wish they showed a close up of her at the plane wreckage scene.  Also, I got lost with who the pretty woman was in the hotel.  Was she the same character as the stewardess on the doomed flight?<br /><br />On another note, I think it is time someone tells the director that showing women with ample assets is an immature choice.  Did anyone see the scene in Beowulf where the barmaid is scantily clad?  It was embarrassing to watch it with my pre teen son.  Same sort of feeling with the opening scene.  You get the feeling that the actress is preening for the camera.  Why the angle with her chest in the opening shot?  Doesn't the director know how distracting this choice is for the audience?  Please make the same choices with showing less at times and more at other moments.<br /><br />There was a scene of intimacy between the pilot and his new found love.  Please see Monster's Ball and how honest and true it was when Halle Berry let her guard down.  Flight leaves us short changed emotionally as these two consenting adults find an emotional connection.<br /><br />It is worth a look.  Give it a chance
1427210241|5.0|Great book, ended about as well as it could considering its the last battle. Not all happy happy as most books . Brandon Sanderson changed the characters slightly, but it made it a litter lighter, still a great ending to a wonderful series. Not everything gets answered but a lot happens. Enjoy.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|Although the obstacles are really nice, it takes to long to load and it is very slow. Sometimes I am lucky if the game will even open.
B00ARAN9JW|4.0|If you expect something other than a movie about a video game, then you're watching the wrong movie.  Not the best movie in the franchise, this seemed more like a forgettable level in a game, but come on this is resident evil the whole franchise is about a video game!<br /><br />Lots of the typical fare, but fun if you like this series.  And I count myself in that group.  So if you like the series, you'll probably like this one.  If you didnt like the first movie, then skip this one.<br /><br />For me, I can't wait for the sequel!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|My daughter and I like to do adventure games together.  We enjoyed this one very much.  It was difficult enough to be enjoyable, but not so much that it was frustrating.  There were some shocking moments, and my daughter laughed at me when I was startled!
B006H5120E|4.0|Bluray is excellent in 2D. No problem with sound. However in 3D , somehow there is no sound at all. i am using a LG 42 inch 3D TV and a no frills 3D bluray player. Just a single HDMI cable connecting the two and using inbuilt TV speakers. Do I need an A/V receiver for the sound? I have used 3D upscaling from DVD/2D Bluray before and there was never a problem. Can somebody help?
B006OCM0G0|4.0|I really like this game but I royally screwed up my game an would love to continue playing but I need a fresh start so......
B009H442DG|5.0|I love the songs that they sing since I've been a fan of them since I was a young girl. Very nice I still listen to it in February<br /><br />Thanks<br />Judith
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|so this game is not great. it doesn't fit the screen on the kindle fire, there are not enough interactive zones through the game, when you pick an object up it doesn't tell you what the object is, its pretty much all ho scenes w no other puzzles, and I am quite dissapointed. I reccomend the carnival game by g5, it was amazing. don't buy this game unless there is no other game you want to play!!!
B001P06GX4|5.0|We were introduced to this game from friends with no kids....we played with them<br />at a weekend getaway.We knew our tweens would love it. Great thinking ahead,<br />skill building concepts...short game...we have been averaging about 3 full games<br />as each sit down. That is how much we enjoy it.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. The character development was great. If you liked the Hunger Games you'll love this!
B009NYF2ES|5.0|Just a word or two about this Blu ray release of Cabaret....there seems to be a divided group regarding the reviews. I would say that this is a major improvement over the DVD release which was infamously bad....<br />The blu ray transfer is really wonderful. It has a soft but very detailed image. The grain of the original film is still visible which is just how it should be. There are many dark scenes in the movie, but the blu ray transfer deals with them with great justice. Daylight scenes do appear to be better, but that is due to the sensitivity of the film stock of that time....<br />Audio wise, there is a great improvement. Voices are central and in combination with left and right channels, a detailed and clean sound is produced. Surround channels provide a little back-up for the main musical numbers, but not much more. Again, a vast improvement over the original DVD.<br />Well worth buying. Five Stars!!
B003EY62II|5.0|Only reason I bought this really is because I liked watching it as a kid and wanted to relive that a bit n see all the special features that werent included on the vhs version lol
B007HACDLK|4.0|Exciting, suspense, twists and well written. Interesting characters that that are well developed. Very enjoyable and what we expect from a Flynn novel.
B005UA0FLE|5.0|I was thinking of getting a song or two but when I listened they were all really, really good. I would encourage anyone to get it.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I loved the way the author tells the story from the perspectives of two characters in the book.  As flawed as the main characters are, they are actually perfect for each other.  The ending was a bit of a let down - I could easily think of a couple different better scenarios, but it's still worth the read.
B0002KVUKM|5.0|Been looking for this one for a while. For some reason my wife and I love watching this movie, but couldn't find a copy for purchase locally. Glad we found it here.
0486296342|3.0|Was really looking for a book with more graphics; there are only a few.  The type is nicely sized, however, and it is easy to read for a second grader.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|A real iPhone 5 car charger, not an adaptor. There are many &#34;adaptor&#34; type chargers for this phone out there, but this one unit is made specificaly for this phone. It can also be used with the newer iPads, too. Well-made and worth it.

B00574P9EQ|5.0|I purchased this as a follow-up to my grandson's books (he has all 7).  I am waiting to hear from him.  He didn't particularly like the first DVD.  He told me it wasn't quite appropriate for a 9 year old.  We got a huge laugh out of that.
1451648537|5.0|Great book. VERY WELL WRITTEN!! Made me understand the type of person Jobs was. He was very demanding and a perfectionist. But without that, Apple would not have existed!!
B000O8OTNC|5.0|very handy tool, i use this to sharpen all my work knifes that i use.. Alays need a good edge for insulation or cutting wire insulation
B003FSTN6Q|5.0|Great set recommend anyone getting it and all the other as well.  If you like ghosts this is a good set to buy.
B00881VLCE|5.0|its a cool game but it needs more puzzles for guys but it ok yea it is cool cool cool cool cool cool cooll
B005S9EK5Y|5.0|I have been a huge fan of Les Miz since I first saw the production in the early 90's. Since then, I have seen the show fourteen times. So I of course was excited that the movie was coming out. I ordered the highlights version of the soundtrack and received that a day before it was to be officially released.<br />Christmas Day arrives and I along with many others hit the theatre to see the movie. I have been a fan of the show and the novel for so long. The way they adapted the stage version and the novel into the movie, amazing. It worked well on so many levels.<br />Hoppers vision was successful. The live singing, the closeups all worked to display emotions on so many levels. I think there were at least three-four different spots sections of the movie where I teared up. That had not happened since I first saw the stage show.<br />Jackman a class act a Valjean. Hathaway's version of Fantine and I Dreamed a Dream were superb. She's won so many award already, if she doesn't win an Oscar, the Academy is nuts. Crowe, many did not like his version of Javert. He started in musical theatre, yes, he's not vocally talented as many of the Javert's on stage...different mediums at work...he pulled it off and did a fantastic job. Casting Sammantha Barks from the stage version to the screen as Eponine, well done. I could spend an entire day listening to On My Own. Eddie Redmayne, excellent performance as Marius. Empty Chairs at Empty Tables was superb.<br />Again, the artistic team paid attention to detail and really brought Hugo's work and message to life in this movie adaptation. The orchestra used to piece this together...wow....Can't  wait to watch this on surround sound!<br />Yes, you will see and hear differences from the stage to the screen. It is unfair to judge one against the other. If a musical is not your thing, don't watch this. Out of all the adaptations of stage to screen shows, this by hands down has to be the best one and so \\"revolutionary\\" in it's approach others pale in comparison.pale in comparison.
B00APUQRPC|4.0|Good Movie - Really Enjoyed It - Just enough of everything in life to keep my teeagers interested in watching, such as some baseball action/dialouge, the dynamics between people, and wondering how it would all play out. Showed the dynamics of business, family, and of an aging father/daughter relationship, both sides to what they were going through, and had gone through.  Great movie that the family enjoyed.
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|I am a James Bond fan and this movie has it all.  I love how it mixes the old with the new.  Of course, it doesn't hurt that I am a huge fan of Daniel Craig.  Can't wait for the next one.
B009VB7P6G|4.0|My children and their friends loved this movie. Tinkerbell wanted to visit the Winter World...and have her sparkly wings again.  Cute story
B007SGLZP8|5.0|The Racketeer definitely held my interest; I could hardly put it down. It has a surprising ending. This book grabbed me from the first page. The author made this storyline unpredictable.  The plot and the characters were great. All John Grisham book fans will not be disappointed
B004I8WD7S|5.0|I am greatly satified with my case, I am curently still using it and I never had ay problem. Great!
B006LSZECO|3.0|I find this book very frustrating.  First, I hate to see guilty people get off without punishment.  Amy needs to be in a psych ward somewhere with the keys lost.  Second, surely there is some way that Nick could find to catch her and prove his story is the right one.  Amy had to trip up somewhere.  Third, I understand how Amy felt about her parents.  They had a codependent love that left her on the outside while using her as fodder for their book series.  You just want to shake parents like that to wake them up and see what they are doing to their child!  And last, I'm frustrated because I want Nick away from this gal so he can raise him in his own way, flawed as it may be.  It doesn't sound like that would happen.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|This game's really hard, really frustrating, and really fun. Timing and accuracy are needed to keep trains from derailing or crashing into each other. Hours of fun
0307593525|1.0|Although this cookbook is excellent, this copy has been hastily put together.<br />In Mastering the Art of French Cooking Volume II, almost two hundred pages are missing. The Index includes recipes that extend beyond the book's final page as well as mislabeled sections. In this copy, recipes end on page 510 and the Appendices begin on page 513, but the Index includes another dessert chapter from 579-665, to include crepes and fillings (pg.'s 648-655), creme brûl&eacute;e (pg 589), tarts (pg.'s 635-638), jams, and glazes. Rice section is also missing (pg.'s 628-635). Furthermore, in the Forward, Julia Child specifically mentions transforming a peasant meal into chateau cuisine by making it in aspic, pg.'s 544-557. All missing! The cucumber section in the index is supposed to be 499-501, but it is actually meringue.<br />I am very disappointed! I will return this book.
B0042RJWTM|5.0|i first watched it when it was in theaters, and decided i would like to have it. lee marvin is hot.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I was a bit intimidated at first glance because there was so much new stuff to it, but once I started it was a blast learning all the new features!  There's a mine where u get to ride a mining cart through that took some getting used to because there's nothing like it on the first Temple Run, but it adds a great and fun element to the game. I find that the objectives are more challenging, fun, and interesting. Also, there are gems you can collect throughout your run to use as a &quot;save me&quot; and each time u use a &quot;save me&quot; the more you have to spend. There's even score boards for people who didn't use the gems and those who did!
B008476HBM|4.0|I like this book in my library because I get a chance to get back to a time that I would have wish that I was never part of.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|A very enjoyable read. Once started could not stop reading. I usually do not read this type of book but was fascinated and would have to continue until finishing it. I would recommend this book to anyone who just likes a good book to read during a snow storm.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I know with all of the reviews there are probably no one reading this sods d d dd d d d d
B00AB0AR2U|2.0|This movie should never have been made.  I have seen all of the resident evil movies ad like most of them, but this one was not good and was extremely hard to follow and understand.
B00AZL3PBK|5.0|it is great works great on the kindle fire- but it does get a little boring though and the graphics rock
B005H0IW6W|5.0|This is a very good CD, highly recommend it for your collection! Good choice of songs, definitely embraces the season, Michael has a beautiful voice!
B003JTHXOK|3.0|This was my first  read of Nicholas Sparks.  I think this novel really kept me turning pages..I will definitely read more of his.  I even cried  at the end...Loved the character's..
B003YFIUW8|5.0|I love the authors decision to take such a horrible event and put it through the eyes of a five year old.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|Great story :) the comedy is intriguing and characters believable.  The middle was a bit predictable to me but still enjoyed it none the less.
B0089J270U|5.0|Finally they started putting Marilyn's movies on Blu-Ray. It's about time. This is a pretty good movie with a pretty good cast. I have the dvd & this is so much better in Blu-Ray. You think the dvd is good until you see the Blu-ray. I can now toss my dvd copy. The color is really nice & it's filmed in the 2:55:1 aspect ratio. For this movie it's the only proper way to go. The audio sounded fine, but I do listen with external speakers hooked up to my old stereo system. No Digital here, but I'm sure it's probably pretty good. It's sad that they only include [2] Featurettes with the Blu-Ray. It would be nice to have had more about the movie & cast. I had to wait for the price to become reasonable, but when it did I snatched it up, & I am glad I did.
B009LT1YZ6|3.0|I played this game on the original kindle fire. I was lost, and I still am. The controls are immposible. The creators sucked at the making. The graphics are amazing, its just I don't get how to move the fish.
B0050PYNO4|5.0|What a neat, funny, well done movie this is. I had never heard of this movie & found it in my local Library & brought it home to watch. I knew right away that I was going to get this on Blu-Ray, & I did. This is so much better than the dvd copy I saw. It is done in the 2:35:1 aspect ratio & for this film it was a wise choice. The color is nice & the audio sounded ok to me, although I do listen with external speakers run through my older stereo system. No Digital here but I'm sure it is probably ok. The extras include: The Making of Paul - BTS Features - The Evolution of Paul - Simon's Silly Faces - Who The Hell is Adam Shadowchild - Trailers - Galleries & a Commentary. All are pretty good. If I was to meet an Alien I would hope it would be &#34;Paul&#34;. I would get a kick out of him rather than being scared to death. You forget while watching the film that he's a computerized image. It seems like he's real. Great animation & Seth really brings character to this crazy little dude. Simon & Nick are perfect for the roles they play & Kristen is really nice too. Jason is a scream. He's so JASON !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!  They should have made a cleaner language version of this movie so grandma could watch it too. I prefer the Unrated version myself. It's a fun movie to watch at anytime. Go ahead & get it.
B00B19F3PG|5.0|I enjoy a good horror movie every now and then, but usually it's either cheesy, predictable or lame. This one I actually only wanted to watch because Matisyahu is in it. After watching it though, there were several times in the movie that gave me chills. Actual surprises in the movie and it was creepy enough for me to not want to go to bed right away, but not too scary to give me nightmares. I really want to buy this movie now and would honestly even buy it as a gift for friends who like movies as well.
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|beautiful story-  heartwrenching , painful at times to read but thoroughly enjoyed this.  great story teller -  a must read
B0083P1QUM|5.0|Very good. Held my attention.  Love her books and will keep reading them as long as she keeps writing them.
B0074QGGK6|5.0|This book is great for anyone who incorporates creativity into their life. It's a refreshingly realistic look that takes the pressure off of one's muses and frees you to make your own choices about your art and what influences it.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It has just enough thrills to keep you interested but not to intense that it is hard to keep reading. A very good book.
B005BY3XHC|5.0|Whenever I feel emotionally or mentally off from stress or pressure or social drama or anything, this book helps me get back to my core self so I can better handle difficulties that come up every day.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|This movie was a wonderful experience visually. The colors, the scenery and the acters.....I loved them all, especially the special effects.
B0053O89IS|5.0|One of my favorite shows on television.  The show is interesting and each character is unique in their own way.  Funny moments and serious moments throughout.
B005LAII0I|4.0|Julia Roberts has been a favorite of mine for a long time. I like everything she does, and this movie did not dissapoint.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I learned what the basics are so i can publish.  I now understand the tools, processes and steps needed to complete my work.
