B000N8IHOU|3|had to modify had to grind down in order to make it fit on mt 302 ford engine
B0087FSA70|4|Overall the Product performed well, definetly made a noticeable improvement.
B0014HR5ZG|5|Good fit, and they worked.
B002NAMJTK|5|Lights look great. Seller was very helpful in replacement of broken item due to shipment
B00REJX5BQ|5|This was a great choice for us. It was a mediumly priced version. We decided we didn't want the roll up kind because we hadn't had luck with them in the past. We couldn't afford one of the really expensive ones. I am happy we chose this one. It fits perfectly on our 2014 Dodge Ram. It was really easy to put it on, and took us less than 30 minutes for two of us to put it on. It seems really durable. We have had it on our truck for a few months now and it is awesome. It has been watertight through some crazy Kansas storms and even hail. Its nice that you can fold it up to make more room if you are carrying something tall or if you are going to a drive in movie and want to hang out in the back. If you want to leave it folded while you drive there are strong clips to hold it together. The only thing I didn't really use was the light. I wasn't really sure where to put it, so we just didn't use it. I would definitely purchase another one of these if I had another truck.
B00TN9HGAQ|5|Exactly what its advertised as. :)
B002UC4XHM|5|Exactly what I needed. Replaced original equipment. Easy to install. Shipped fast.
B00FWOKMI4|5|Great product very bright on my 1994 jeep grand Cherokee Laredo
B00Y7CABS8|5|Love them nice add on
B006O0DSAO|5|Easy to install about 1/2 hour.  Works grate.<br /><br /> Golf Cart Chrome 7 Wire Turn Signal Switch
B008ETMV8I|5|These things are great. Way better and more compact than the cargo net I also purchased. I wish I would have gotten another set!
B007TB4ZCW|5|Good looking mat, perfect size I think.  Exactly as described.
B007VXCYOO|5|Perfect fit, no wiring adapter required. 1996 Chevy Silverado CK2500 Diesel.
B000CSD29Q|4|works great with my sinster kit.
B00I8IU9TS|3|Did not fit as well as OEM...but OK.
B00LG07MZE|5|“Wonderful it keeps the car cooler and goes up easy. I was impressed the seller sent an email with insructions before it arrived.”
B0068C30NS|4|Installed this on a Honda Ruckus.  Easy to install.  Had to modify two areas in order for it to work perfectly.  Had to shave off part of the mount in order for one wire to clear (see photo).  Also had to install a few resistors on the tach wire because I have a aftermarket CDI installed.  Drilling for the speedo was easier than I thought it would be.  Looks great and has lots of options.
B000CB7E10|5|Fit great
B001RAYN1E|5|Purchased for hubby for christmas gift as well as cleaning out his car, he loved it.
B004KED8CO|1|This is advertised to fit 17mm.  It does not. I repeat, it does not. I have metric sockets and 17mm perfect fit. This wrench does not fit 17mm. (too big)
B00XAIN574|5|Exact fit, easy installation, looks good and protects.
B004W4OOKW|1|Not really &quot;plug and play&quot; as advertised. Basic electrical work needs to be done to get the CCF and LED lights to work. The standard headlight (swapped from OEM) is plug and play but the other two need to be hardwired into you vehicle harness.
B00OAMP3KQ|5|Very bright, great company to buy from.
B0006IX7WY|2|At least they're cheap...but they don't fit the holes in either my fridge or my brothers.  They're still usable via friction, but there are holes in the fridge designed to accept cross bars, just not these.
B000WK4EC8|5|Buying this in bulk saves a lot of money.  This product works reasonably well but nothing replaces elbow grease.
B0017H9N4E|1|day I got it harbor freight was advertising same make for $69. way over priced my fault for ordering same
B005IHAPBY|5|Great frames
B000PA00XM|5|Although these cost 3 times as much as other aux inputs for e46 BMWs listed on this site, the premium is well worth it. The cable is wrapped in a strong protective layer which allowed me to bend it to fit very easily without worrying about damaging the connector. I've had this installed for awhile now and I have had perfectly crisp sound coming through my speakers. These are a great upgrade for anyone who wants a modern touch on their e46 without comprising the refined look of the stock interior. Please double check that your radio will be compatible before ordering this product, there are a wealth of resources online to find out if your radio will work. Check out the e46fanatics forum or just google it.
B000IYLK02|1|STOP! Do not order this part to replace the ignition coil connector. Although the description says it will, the housing is not compatible. I gave 1 stars as I was able to use the wires supplied with the connector with my existing connector housing.
B008VUFIG2|3|Not sure it's any better then just using soapy water!
B00S8KQ83C|2|As universal seat covers go these were pretty much like everyone elses but the price was better. I had 2 issues though : the 1st was that they wouldn't fit my car. When you put in your make, model and year and it tells you it will fit it should and that even goes for a universal fit. I know that it won't be a perfect fit but you should be able to put them on. I watched their installation video and it did'nt address my problem which was that my rear seat belts went through slots cut in the bottom seat cushion which meant I would have to cut the cover and this brings me to my 2nd issue bad customer service: I called the company and was greeted by the typical automated system that placed me on hold where I sat for 30 minutes before I gave up and then sent them back. So if you have a 2003 mitsubishi eclipse don't bother with universals. I gave them  2 stars not so much for the quality but for the lack of customer service and misleading info on the fit.
B007USCM7E|5|So cool ~~~~~<br />Real working.
B00FNAX7KW|1|Didn't work as replacement for front parking lamps in 2005 Mercedes E500 (W211).  Error message appeared on dash display and lights flickered on about once every six seconds or so.
B000OOMR6M|5|My 2009 road King burnt through the clutch at 7k miles with recomended adjustments. So I thought I would try the Rivera pro aftermarket cluck system. I could tell right out of the box that this was a way better system that Harley's. The contact surface on the clutch plates and disc is so much larger than the stock unit. The installation was quick and easy. Had the bike back on the road in just over a hour. Road 3k miles round trip to Sturgis and back the next day with no issues at all.<br />I would highly recommend this clutch to anyone tired of the Wimpy Harley clutches! This clutch system will not disappoint!
B00NBT4774|5|Great product! Good quality, well packed and it does the job!
B005XUYDV4|5|This was fairly easy to change and solved my problem of two of my cylinders missing.
B0002SRCMO|5|This tool worked perfectly.
B00L84EKI0|5|Works great nice quality
B00HE68EBU|2|Ah...not so fast.  Although it did work as advertised the first time...and produced a pretty good amateur scratch fill...the second time was a complete flop.  The paint solidified in the ball point dispenser 4 months after the first use.  It did not deliver an ounce of paint.  And I could not even open the paint brush applicator, for probably the same reason.  The only part of three-in-one that was accessible was the clear coat.  In my opinion, this is a one-and-done product.  Which makes it a pretty expensive repair product.
B0086I9YDC|5|great
B00PUOQRK8|4|great product if you are looking for a protective cover for your vehicle seat.  I own a 2011 Tundra and it fits great.  I am using for times when I get out of crossfit class....I don't want to sweat on the leather seats....this cover does the job and is comfortable too.
B00ERIA8XU|5|MAKING SMILES
B00P9W8NLW|5|Device worked great for draining tranny fluid. It would apear that it should work for any medium viscosity fluid just as well. A nice storage bag and additional connectors or other accesories would be nice, but still a great bargain compared to the more expensice options or the other cheapie plastic pumps out there.
B005LQTC3O|5|These can save you a lot of hassle and money. They not only protect your hands but also your levers and on quads, the hand brake assembly.
B00VU7LLT6|5|Definitely not a driveway project but a quality product would use again
B00M5WYWPU|5|These are Superior Quality! Love em! Forget buying the dealer!!!! Incredible value here!!!
B0012PR59G|1|Does not work with my car. One of the contacts is missing but I can't return because I put it in and tried to use it and since it now is not set like it was when I received it I figured I couldn't return it. Wasted money. Mine has six contacts and this one only has 5. Not sure if prong is missing or made that way.
B00ZN2Y0GK|5|The Abdtech Motorcycle Bluetooth Helmet Headset/Intercom is a very convenient way to communicate with your riding partner.  My husband & I love to get out on the bike on weekends but have never owned any type of communication device for our helmets.  When asked to try out the Abdtech Bluetooth Headset for free, we happily agreed.  We have now used the device several times and found it to be an easy way to converse while roaming the countryside.  We have also been able to stream our favorite playlists from our phones and finally enjoy music while we ride.  My husband has found the Abdtech Bluetooth Headset especially helpful when he needs to take client calls while we’re out on the bike.  He can now safely take calls hands-free instead of pulling over every time a call comes in.  We definitely give the Abdtech Motorcycle Bluetooth Helmet Headset/Intercom two thumbs up.<br /><br />*Please note, I was given this product (free) to test, in exchange for my honest review.
B000CITK8S|5|I use this tender with with my Odyssey PC680. Still doing a great job one year later for cars that don't get run enough.
B000NE7TJ8|5|Product worked great. My husband was a happy guy.
B012CKJ6TG|5|Autofeel offered me this light for free in exchange for my honest review. I gave this light to my son-in-law because he has experience with these lights. This review is written by him.<br /><br />This is a 52” curved light bar, so it is a monster. Be sure your vehicle can accommodate such a wide light because it can be quite wide for some models. I ended up mounting this to my friends Ford F150 Raptor and it was basically flush with each side of the vehicle. Though you can do whatever you want with your vehicle and LED light bars, this 52” light bar is perfect for forward facing either installed at/near the front grill or on top of the vehicle aimed at an angle outward in front of your vehicle.<br /><br />This light bar comes with mounting hardware, though the mounting hardware is nothing fancy. You can definitely mount the light with the included hardware, but we made our own mounting hardware by purchasing a kit and modifying it. This gave us much more freedom of movement and much easier in-field angle adjustments. The light comes with a thick gage wire already connected to the light with your positive and negative ends that you must connect to your vehicle. This is pretty simple to do. We connected to an on/off switch that we mounted inside the truck on the dashboard and then connected to its own dedicated fuse. I’ve known some people that will connect these to a second, somewhat dedicated battery as this pulls a lot of juice. Whether you connect this to your main power supply or a dedicated battery, be sure you have your engine running when using this light bar because it will quickly drain your battery if the alternator isn’t replenishing the charge. We’ve got an upgraded electrical system to handle a stereo system, so we have no problems with the batteries.<br /><br />The LED light bar is insanely bright! There is somewhere around 100 individual LED diodes. Each one is ever so slightly angled into the middle so you get a nice bright focused beam of light straight out in front of the vehicle (wherever you point it) and then the light bar will also distribute the light in all directions around it. The result is the highest concentration of light directly in front of your vehicle so you will get the brightest, highest quality definition on the roadway in front of your vehicle. Because the light is also emitted in a 180* direction all around the light, plus due to the fact that light will bounce off other objects, the result is basically everywhere in front and to the side of your vehicle flooded with light. If you are doing a night drive in the desert where it is otherwise pitch black, you will basically turn the night into daytime.<br /><br />We tested this out in some heavy mud romping, some rain, a car wash, and some serious offroad pounding. No water, moisture, mud, dirt, etc., entered anywhere in the light. The rear cooling fins did collect mud, but it was fairly easy to hose out. Bottom line, this is an extreme LED light bar for the extreme users!
B00K9B994I|5|Very nice!
B00C5T2BPG|5|Great roof rack for those who don't want some giant cage that is more for looks than function. Strap the surfboards on top and head to the beach, this is perfect for that scenario...
B00JJVJ1QK|3|These arrived quickly and my husband was really excited to put them on. He has a 2015 Silverado. The big emblems on the grill and tailgate are plastic a little raised in areas. These did not stick at all! I believe it was a combination of the raised ridges in the emblem and the poor quality vinyl adhesive. Either way, $10 down the drain.
B008KZQWRM|5|Excellent quality.  Very easy to swap with the broken original.
B00480GZ8O|5|Super bright
B00ZZMQSEK|5|Installed on a 2005 Ford E150 takes approximately 15 to 20 minutes you do not need to take doors apart I tow a 8 foot wide trailer works great
B006ROPLXO|5|its right on my rear window of my truck.
B001GCRWCU|4|These are very well made boots for the money.  The foot room, however is a little &#34;tall&#34; making the boot seem too large.  An added liner solved that issue.  The heel not at the optimum angle for my walking style and will have to wear down a bit.
B000C2Y5IY|1|does not fit a dodge 2500 ram 360
B0093A9YXW|5|It just needs to unfurl a bit at the ends, otherwise the shade fits my 2014 Prius perfectly and kept the car cool.
B00A9YIO3W|5|love brought 2 for my cars
B005HR1K46|4|Nice heavy duty piece
B00192JGDU|4|Easy to set up and take down. Stores in fairly small space. Seems sturdy. Keeps cooking away from other service areas. Only complaints: top surface is slick so grill slides if on uneven ground; wish it stood a little taller.
B004PL4H0O|5|Great! we use these to tie down our kayaks. Very nice for the price!
B003BVYXFI|5|So much better than having my neighbor hold my motorcycle.
B0007XXTVC|5|The switch on our camper vibrated loose &amp; blew during our last camp outing.  I pulled the cover off, Googled the part number, ordered it off Amazon, got it 2 days later, pulled it out of the package, hooked it up, hit the hot water heater switch &amp; BOOM...it fired right up.  The nice thing is that it arrives just like it looks in the picture.....2 switches &amp; an extra wire in case your wire is bad.  Worked great for me !!!
B000C2AKD8|5|1997 Explorer with 215K miles. 2K miles on the gaskets and no leaks. Fel-Pro is generally good stuff. Don't know why they are sold in pairs.
B0007RS4B8|5|SMELLS LIKE BUBBLE GUM
B00IOBSXQ0|3|I couldn't give this black beauty a five star because, it not working as expected. It give my tires a dull wet look that doesn't last long.
B004UPZXQM|3|Works well as a quick detailer. Adds shine and depth to paint.  I wouldn't classify it as a sealer because it seems to wash away with every wash.  Used Chemical Guys Mr. Pink and Honey Dew in my foam cannon and 2 bucket wash. It doesn't repel water well and provides no beading action therefore leaving water spots on the paint.
B00JFDHQMS|5|Good
B00SVRHD22|5|I should have read the product description more clearly, for these are larger than anticipated, which is good. Great value for the money, and I love having two colors. These microfiber towels are great -- work as advertised. Shipping was also very fast. Thanks!
B00029CYRG|5|Good product
B00DPBMWJS|4|These work nicely, but they're noticeably dimmer than the traditional, incandescent #93 bulb in my Dazor &#34;high intensity&#34; lamp.  (I'd really like one that is even brighter than the traditional incandescent bulb.)
B006ZLDXFW|5|Great Carburetor right out of the box. I bolted it on and it started right up. On a mild Chevy 350 9:1 it's been running great. I adjusted the idle mixture quickly. This engine has never run so well. Nicely finished and lightweight compared the old holley i took off.<br /><br />Very happy!!!!!!!
B002X6VXL4|1|After 2 short uses, the compressor feature stopped working.  We contacted Stanley and were told that although it is under warranty, we have to pay to have this shipped to them, and they will replace it.  It is ridiculous that they will not stand behind their product.  We are now trying to work with Amazon to see if we can return it to Amazon at no cost to us.
9539751047|5|Great Sticker
B004BTBUXC|5|they look cool and work as they should
B003V6O420|3|DIDNT CUT THE NOISE AT IDLE AT ALL. 523 cu in ford 3 inch plumming
B004A6M6C0|5|Nice part fit just like OEM
B001FEOSPS|5|Installed on my 2014 Sierra Denali to help with towing a 30' Work n Play toy hauler.  Made a huge difference.  Needed to replace the factory 20&#34; Goodyears with a set of 10-ply tires and upgrade the rear shocks to a set of Bilstein 5100s to complete the package.  Truck now tows like a 3/4 ton and handles the toy hauler with ease.  Highly recommend a set of Firestones if you are towing anything over 20' or working with a tongue weight over 600lbs.  Wish I had an on-board compressor to inflate/deflate the bags when hooking up the trailer...probably my next purchase.
B000CONU1K|5|Nice product.  It fits perfect in my Ford Fusion 2015
B00BCRMB34|2|Not suited to my vehicle but stated it was
B007EGCNRG|3|Product is ok. I've already had two of these. The first one had a very weak magnet and the second one had a little stronger magnet. However, both had fallen about two feet and the magnets broke into pieces. I will be changing the magnet in this one to a much stronger and durable magnet.
B000C7US6C|5|What can I say outside it works?
B00EKTK4IK|1|Not good didn't fit car.
B000F5LJ7S|5|Looked all over for this tool.  I knew it existed but could not find it on the shelf.<br />Right price, Right tool!!<br />Thanks!
B004996SPE|5|I bought these to replace the front shocks on my 2011 Ram 1500.  They are so much smoother than the original shocks even when the truck was new.  I recently traded the 2011 in for a 2015 and I am considering replacing the OEM shocks with these.
B000HURIX0|5|Ver y fine
B00MGI585G|4|Fit a little smaller then I expected. Well made & good quality.
B007TNJZSO|5|Perfect
B000OC6XG4|5|Fits nicely. Even with the factory dash. Too bad for you, I seem to have bought the last set available. Hopefully they'll manufacture some more.
B002NAQMIY|5|Work great
B00SAFQ0DI|2|These LEDs seem very well made.  I purchased them because of the warranty, they were listed as error free, and they appeared to be well made.  I installed them above my license plate on a 2012 Ford Explorer.  They worked great for a few months.  But then I noticed that some of the LED panels began to dim by about 50%.  I after a few more weeks, both installed LED’s showed the same issue of dim panels.  I was very disappointed.  Picture attached is when only one light was showing issues.<br /><br />I contacted the seller and they did offer to replace my LED’s within 2 days after I would send the bulbs back to them.  Quick customer service and very nice.  It was going to cost me $3 to send them back.  I decided to try to purchase another bulb from another supplier in hopes of having better luck.
B000IG5PZQ|3|It does what I expected, and suits my purposes.  It seems overpriced relative what you pay for more complex electronic devices.  But it targets the automotive market, which appears to up the price of any product.
B000GTUL3G|5|Very good
B00BTL8TFW|5|Brand new. Great fit. Good color and looks great. Tabs seem tough I didn't break any installing and the plastic seems to be more durable than the o.e.(more flexible but still tough)  Everything I expected and more.
B008BVNNK4|5|Really good stuff & great protection for my interior
B00OW0NQGE|5|Just as described, love it
B004J73VKQ|5|Works perfectly for covering wires running across the floor.
B0049IZSS8|1|Not to impressed. In order for the bolts to stay tight I had to buy an extra set of nuts<br />( jam nuts) then when I put those on I wasn't ble to put a wrench on the jam nut after tightening the bolt because of the section hanging down below. I had to hire someone to cut off that area so I could put a wrench on it.
B00HZW7FXQ|5|Exactly what I was looking for!
B002O49P7Y|5|Good price for a new strap. Fast delivery.
B000CNN1B0|5|Flowmaster works great my truck is quieter than it has ever been I get good Air flow and good performance. My truck is a 69 Chevy three quarter ton 4 by 4 with a Chevy 350 motor thank you
B00513G82U|1|Was not assembled at all, cheaply made, not very sturdy. Didn't come prefabricated at all.I had to drill all the holes, most of the screws wouldn't fit. Needs to be advertised as she'll only. The brackets were cheap and not very good quality parts. I don't recommend carrying much in this box as it is unstable.
B00FE7DR9U|5|Film works great as advertised.
B00F2NLMHU|3|This is a nice exhaust.  The fit is good and the performance is great. But it is loud.
B008K816HU|2|Does the job, but not as strong as I would like so his may be a 1-2 time use item.<br />Company was great a sending it to me quickly.
B003IS3HV0|1|This stuff is garbage.darkens leather and leaves leather sticky. Big mistake.plus there's not enough left to do couch,now my footstool doesn't match couch.
B00T3TQLKW|5|ok
B004FFHJ14|5|keeps my car at least 20 deg. cooler and looks cooler than other shades
B00SNQ57TC|5|Good buy for the money. Took a little effort to get on but no big deal. They fit well in my 2005 Outback XT and look pretty good. No complaints.
B00QMAR6NG|5|fixed good
B00QAROAGC|5|I bought this keychain for my friend, she loves it.
B00WG0NLXK|5|Agree.  It is a very nice assortment at a very nice price.  Arrived much quicker than estimated delivery date.  Have not actually used the pads yet but so far I am very pleased with my purchase.
B000BFR6TM|3|It is still about 1 1/2&#34; to short in Height. We decided to keep it. Would like to know what we could add to make it longer
B00062ZH2S|3|First of all this tint is BLUE! It is not black like the description. I was hoping it would at least be close to grey when I bought it. But nope, it's blue. The rest of my cars tint are grey and now my sunroof is blue. It's a thin material compared to the suntek brand. However it is easy to trim. Installation was also very easy as long as you wipe your window clean and then cleaner than clean, so that there's no air bubbles. It came out crystal clear.  Overall I would recommend this product due to the price and quality. Now we'll see how well it does over time.
B003XGYDE2|1|I couldn't figure out how to attach components. I had to go to local store and spend more to get one that did not need attaching<br />anything.
B00BC372EG|5|Was as advertised!
B00I2Y01LO|1|Like the one from the dealer this did not click into the existing seatbelt.<br />This is a type a and I believe I need the type d to fit my Toyota.<br />so Buyer beware...
B000QJA1FY|5|Brand name fluid with Marine rating at a fair price.
B012E87QHU|5|My son is learning to drive so in addition to the Student Driver magnets I bought these to add a little humor for the passing drivers. They hold firm but are easily removed.
B00AO9L18M|4|look good, but to short...
B00M03GGHQ|4|Came from over seas. Quality plug exact match. Friendly seller.
B00CHDBU2U|5|As always CarPartsDepot was fast, priced right and good product. Bought other products from them as good.

B000CQ0052|5|very nice quality close to msd quality
B00IPS4APU|4|Easy to use. My cracks are gone. The kit comes with everything you need.
B008N229GK|1|This is an EOD (Explosive Ordnance Disposal) Badge. NOT the EFMB
B00JIIZCM6|4|Its a decent product, or maybe im using it wrong
B002LKJD7S|1|The exact part I needed, but it broke exactly 69 days after I ordered it and my steps are not retracted and extended all the time, mostly locked out extended. We are longtimers at the local KOA. One of the pins that is flared to hold it in place came out. I am going to call and see if there is any way to get another one.
B00BRYF0PS|5|Very useful fit extremely well
B00KC9HIG8|5|Haven't had to use them yet thank God, but I love the color, and they seem well made.

B00XBEK002|5|Very bright light for the price .  This is the light you want trust me
B00GSAUHB8|5|Car is not as hot as with previous sunshade. Size is large enough to cover entire windshield.
B0081S5IP0|5|It took care of my need, since the hook broke off the original hang tag. It also reduces the warping of the tag in a hot sun.
B00KFPDLZQ|5|They work great. Really bright and clear. I would suggest purchasing
B006X8BRAA|5|Fits perfect in the santa fe great for what it is..
B004596SY4|3|They are nice looking, however I expected a thicker, softer, and a higher quality product from BMW.
B0080KN7RU|5|Looks great on my battle wagon, lol.

B00UEMH5L6|1|This product is cheap looking. 2 grills feel off on road some where.
B001D27W32|2|I needed to do more research. The Toyota Sienna did not not start to offer a cabin air filter until the 2004 model. Although the Amazon make/model fit feature confirmed it would fit a 2000.

B0044B0Z06|5|Good quality
B000VSCB94|2|Handlebar fitment is great. But the electronics is terrible. The RPM needle does not hold steady. It fluctuate between 200-300 RPM while cruising.
B00JQL5RCK|5|Really nice.going on a trip and now I don't having e to worry about my arm sticking to the leather.Very comfortable to your arm.
B0012Q9ZSO|5|Great Price, this is OEM spark plugs on my 2008 Prius. Good for 120,000 miles.  Even at 120k Miles, the ones I pulled out looked like they are still good for another 120k. Hardly any wear. The Iridium is wielded on both the tip and the plug making the plug last so freaking long.
B000WPOWGG|3|Will these fit tech 3 boots?
B007T0EEC4|5|Exactly what I expected for my product, shipping was quick and fast! Fit perfectly on my vehicle, very happy with my purchase.
B0068FVKW8|2|ok
B0009IBJE4|5|Have charged about 10 batteries and I love they way it works.  Never had a problem yet.
B006DY4SRS|5|Fits exactly like the original.  (Still haven't figured out where I put the original one when I went to top off my fluid!)
B004RCSZNQ|5|Replaced the light on my 2004 Rialtia. Works great
B0012TPVC0|5|Good quality product
B004GYKO9S|5|MUCH better than standard bungees for securing your tire chains. Would purchase again.
B000CRO4G2|4|Most cars do not have ashtrays, but some have cup holders that are in reach of the driver.  I bought this Blue mood Ash Tray to set in one of the cup holders.  It is nice to have it light up when the lid is open.  My only issue is that the ash tray is not a tight fit in my cup holder, so sometimes sits cock- eyed,  That's a bit annoying, but not the ashtray's fault, so I gave it 4 stars.
B000C5G08E|5|Oe motorcraft.  What more
B00J3H9SJ0|5|The Matress was advertised as firm and i was hoping for a bit softer and it is.  It got to me quickly and fits perfect.
B000C9SNFI|5|Car running better with these.  Reasonable price and new plugs make a difference in an older engine.
B005N53AM2|4|a little large for my steering wheel but not a problem
B00029WYD0|5|Wish there was something less expensive.
B00OSL4OIG|1|It's says it will fit my Toyota Highlander 2015 but it didn't so frustrated how can I return i opened it already throw the original packaging please need an answer thanks
B001CEG90I|5|perfect fit, seems to work fine and much better price than dealer
B000F285EG|5|Good product, works well and keeps my shaft and handle quiet and in place.  Would definitely purchase again.
B009M0S4U2|3|Just ok
B00CT30SSU|4|Seems OK. Compared it to the original I removed and no differences bothered me. Regardless of brand, this is by far the easiest most cost effective DIY one can do to a car. Pay the mechanic to do your filthy oil. Air filters take a minute and a half and save $50.
B00PYZ00RY|5|OEM perfect fit - these were inexpensive and look like the originals (that were stolen off our Element)
B004XACFK6|1|The left half of strobe went out on 3rd use
B00PM8AT5Q|5|On time just what show
B0051SUM9U|3|This instructions are horrible, basically nonexistent. Pain to install, took just over 2 hours as the fittings were not perfectly aligned. Needed a crow bar to force adjustments. Definitely need two people for installation.<br /><br />Once finally installed, the bar is sturdy and looks nice.
B00JJQ97OQ|5|Beautiful color and sticker. It is going on my back window of my car!
B000CSD2T6|5|Good quality which Wix is known for. Put this in a 1964 Buick with a 401 Nailhead engine.
B0041QIMPO|5|Works great.  Used on a Honda Ruckus with both front and rear LED turn signal and stock turn indicator.
B004JKQH7M|4|It is what it says and arrived quickly
B004I0YLVC|3|The cut out for the smaller bulb did not fit. We had to sand it down to make it larger.
B005G53IBM|5|Put this in my 1997 Heritage Springer (EVO engine), with a Andrews EV-27 and S&S Super E carb.  Huge difference in performance.  The only fault with this module is that the indicators and switches are on the back, unlike some other modules.
B0010B00IA|3|Does not get cold enough. Would not buy another one.
B00J9PCREE|5|Exactly what I needed. Arrived on time.
B005BNG1U4|5|Thanks so much. Your sale arrived just as promised. A+
B00CFBT90O|5|Works great on a 2008 Dodge Grand Caravan with a stocked leaking radiator hose.  Easy install and fits perfectly.
B000COS4ZW|5|worked fine, well made
B001CF19TS|2|Thought it was like the one in the photo... It is all black. Good box, but doesn't match my Sahara colors.
B00M9MWJKQ|5|Good quality and easy install, but you have to remove it change your oil....no big deal
B007W88A6E|5|Perfect match
B00ECHQIDK|5|Easy to install on a flat part of the bar.
B00KMUES6K|5|These pads work great on the street. I think the Stock SS pads are probably almost as good but these feel great and stop a heavy car very well.
B000CCFBVY|5|Used this bumper to replace a old rusty one for better resale. Worked awesome! Great fit on my 2004 wrangler unlimited.
B001A1OWYI|3|Not perfect but does the job
B00LY8W168|3|The compressor works.  Takes much longer to male cold air than the oem compressor it replaced.  Cannot make cold air at idle.  Update: 1SEP15 A/C no longer produces cold air at all.
B00YB5GAEA|5|Small, bright and effective. Being rechargeable is nice too. Aluminum body makes this tail light virtually bullet proof. This best part is it's easy to turn on & off, just push the lens, instead of a small button that is often hidden on other cheap lights.
B008YFU4VS|5|Great lights are small enough the bulbs fit in my fog lights with out hitting the lens
B009EU5ZMK|5|Worked great.
B00NWGZ3A6|4|Good
B001WX4E74|5|Amazing products i will continue to add chemicalguys to the kit
B003ZVA6PA|5|These towels are great! Very absorbent and are excellent for cleaning. I used a towel to wash my windows and they came out crystal clear. The fabric really helped me clean off all the nose art my dog loves to leave behind.
B00FB6EOE6|5|My Application was a 2002 BMW e39 Touring. Still working awesome, I really disliked the Halogen look for the angel eyes. Swapped them out for these, Started in the dusk and took my time until it got dark. Installation is easy and quick  Shouldn't take more than 10 Minutes per light with no prior knowledge of the system. Easy Plug and Play.
B001DRGB5W|5|Perfectly fit to my 2006 Toyota Rav4 Limited with out 3rd seat....Better than the original Rotor i have in the car.... Nice quiet and smooth ride from the start and no vibration... Pretty good motor with a good price... I will recommend this if you want a cheap and perfect replacement. Also matched it with ACDelco Professional Durastop Ceramic Front Disc Brake Pad Set...  Make sure you do your researched first, they have a different size if you have a 3rd seat....
B009DK7WRW|5|Look Great on a reconditioned Toyota pickup
B007KA7PP6|5|Good fit , works well , nice price
B000E4OL4S|5|It came in 2 days late, but it's very durable just as the original that it replaced
B00CEVKJ3Q|5|I Purchased this after i saw a video on YouTube where the Gentleman was installing it on his motorcycle, and i have to say HID kit could not get any simple to install, if you have an old bike and wants to give her a fresh new look, this HID light kit is what your looking for, How ever if you don't want to Cut and splice wires you will need a separate connector not supplied with this kit, you will need an h4 male connector so you don't have to Cut the original connector off the bike wiring hardness in case you have to reinstall the stock light back on.
B005BNZBFA|4|works well.easy set up ,box was opened  and rubber ring for flag was missing .I received 3 rings instead of four.Reason I know this is because I bought 2 .1 was complete.
B0064SOF6M|5|I love Scooby Doo stuff.
B004J2CQU2|5|Great item; fast shipping.
B0038RDQA8|5|Yes I was please with this item !!
B00R0424JO|4|I got these and installed them in the bed of my pickup because the tonneau cover blocked out the factory cargo light from illuminating the bed contents. For the money this is not a bad kit. The lights are more than bright enough to light the bed up well. I have a six foot bed so I actually took the last light off each strip and have only three down each side. The self stick backing holds the lights tightly in place. I stuck them directly to the frame rails of my tonneau and taped the wires to the rail with black duct tape so they are secure and practically invisible. I installed a switch for these, and they definitely make the bed more usable for cargo at night.
B00WZHLS8O|4|Coolest helmet on the road !!!
B00R1FG17S|5|no problems .!!  would recommend to anyone
B00UCQOD7I|4|i gave four stars because i have not needed to use it.  it appears to be up to the job.  the rating is all i should need with jeep wrangler.
B00AKEWPX6|5|Perfect fit and does the job at a lower price.
B00L8F4KT8|4|i like it but, at night i would like to dim the rear view.
B000CIXOXA|5|Great price, great filter. Shipping is a little high.
B00S8W38O2|5|Very very good keep your echo going
B003VXN4JC|4|I really dislike having to knock off a star.  The product is exactly as described and a very solid build.  It looks great on my truck and keeps my load safe.  I had to knock off a star because of the packaging which is poorly designed.  The bottom end is the back end of the cover.  There are only foam spacers so when it is lifted from this point the box crushes.  Because the box is heavy it must be shipped freight.  Because it is shipped freight they are not very careful with it.  Luckily all the pieces made it to my house.  However the box bottom was badly damaged so there are some small abrasions that I'm over looking because you can't see them until you get up close, after buffing them.  They need a full foam bottom for the protection of the product to be rated excellent.
B009F10S3Y|4|Looks great but second day the 3m tape got loose on the curvy parts on the bumper , solution for that? Any type of expoxy or glue that won't be permanent . Thanks in advance
B00J622WP4|1|sists to high on the head looks stupid
B002SE1G9U|5|I had the old 'bubble' style on my F150 and one of them came off in the car wash (they had been on for nearly 5 years, so they were showing a little wear).  I bought these because they seemed so highly recommended, and I'm really happy with the purchase.  They look great.  They make less wind noise than the old style.  They install easily.  Good purchase, highly recommend.
B0081KM748|5|Works good at night, but don't even think of using it in the day light.
B000A8MWL2|5|Works perfectly for a oil cooler. The sensor is very thin and easy to break. First one snapped with no effort. I barely snugged the second one and it doesn't leak with a good pipe sealant just ne weary.
B00K8WO768|5|A very bright and wide beam of light !<br />Very handy for lighting up an area.
B00OMT6UEK|1|Kinda Worked for a month, would disconnect every few hours, now dead, Galaxy S6 sees it but won't connect.<br />But the full size ones, ive had it for over a year and no problems.
B00I8U12TW|4|Product itself is of good quality. Nice and dark as expected. Application however is such a hassle because of the curvature of the lights. I would recommend getting a tint shop to install them although some may not because of local/state laws. Overall a nice, cheap mod that will really improve the whole look of your Z.
B00283V7AY|5|Just installed them.  Look great. Will see how they do in northern winter. Will write another review in spring
B009YKVR18|5|look great
B00029XC1I|1|Cheap Stickers. Low Quality
B00RPGWE9C|5|I always put Husky Liners in my new trucks and these definitely did not disappoint in my 2015 F150. Fit great and cover much more floor than the mats provided by Ford. The standard mats barely cover 60% of the floor!
B00873J0YY|5|Easy to install, already rusting though.  But for the price you can't go wrong.
B003BZD03K|5|This is a cheap, simple device to keep a suspended hose from kinking. A must have for camping
B00AFBXQNC|3|It does provided a lot of foam in my foam cannon and 2 bucket wash and is slick on the paint.  The only drawback is that it seems to strip any wax or sealant from the paint leaving it very grippy and not slick and smooth as it was before washing.
B00MF5FRV0|1|Doesn't hold a charge for long and melted cables when trying to jump car
B004VR08IW|5|Pretty easy to install. Work great.
B004SSEF56|5|Love the lanyard, goes with my Jeep
B007T1OEVY|4|The 11mm actually has two specifications. The part that I have received was not an exact fit. I have to make the pivot hole a bit bigger and grind down part of the component to make it turn smoother. MotorKing immediately offers to exchange the part plus discounts when I mentioned the problems to them. Great customer service!
B00B0C08WM|5|works as advertised, looks nice and never get rusted
B000C2WF0E|2|I bought and used this for several months and have to say I am not crazy about it. The key is always difficult to insert and sometimes hard to turn. I started worrying about it breaking off into the lock so I went back to my regular cap.
B004BFUS52|5|Use a little bit and it works well. Time will tell about how long and well water beads.
B007PKJUKO|1|It kept leaking out of the car as soon as I turned the gas on
B000EDOSMO|1|Leaks
B003YK5KHG|5|Can't see being without it!
B001GF7M8G|4|Worth the price. Easy to use but bulky to stow.
B00CNEFDM6|5|Loved it!
B0002U2V1Y|5|good product
B002OR41UM|5|A must for older converters. Newer ones come with this circuitry built in. Allows you to leave the trailer plugged in during storage without boiling the batteries. Another nice feature is the boost mode. I put it in boost while charging from a generator. Makes the batteries charge much faster this way.
B0006JLU22|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B00173FH7A|5|Fits perfectly in a 2013 135is, performs wonderfully.
B00ESBOL3E|5|Great light bar for the price. It is very bright. It's brighter in person than in the pic.
B00QCMSX90|5|Keychain is nice and sturdy.  I like it.
B0002TDUW4|5|I just used this on my new truck over the weekend. Prep was difficult but so far it looks fantastic. Saved $350 over the pros. Will give another review after a winter in Colorado.
B00839W3NC|5|Great quality and style.
B00F6751L0|5|just what i needed
B0000AXNJS|3|NOTHING TO BRAG ABOUT- EXPENSIVE AS WELL
B00SUTAXKU|3|Ordered this for 2014 klr650 and arrived a day early, awesome! I ordered the light smoke sport touring and the clear sport touring arrived, boo. Mounted in 5 minutes using existing hardware, easy. When driving it stops the wind from hitting your chest but moves it up to the bottom third/middle of your helmet, I'm 5' 11&#34;. Still allows a lot of wind buffeting and noise
B011GLHLNA|5|Beautiful plate, carefully wrapped so as not to cause damage to product in shipping.  Very happy with purchase.
B00JJQ9YJY|5|Great colorful sticker for the back car window.
B0051SEA5C|5|Exactly as pictured works great.
B00SW8TJ8Q|5|Was a little unsure of how good this unit would be but decided to take a chance. The light came with a 2 foot power cord with connectors on the end. I ended up running to the auto store to get wire, rocker switch, and a fuse holder to hook it all up.The light bar does come with flood light LED's on the outside and beam LED's in the center. I mounted the lightbar on the upper windshield. The light bar is very bright! I have had it installed for almost a month now and I have not seen any moisture inside the housing. It's been through a few thunderstorms and car washes and so far so good. I would recommend this for anyone who wants a nice light bar for a low price.
B00YE360TO|5|14' SQ5 fits perfectly. Nice cheap addition that looks stock.
B00JJREVKU|5|I love this sticker and it looks great on my car window.
B0060YHLJS|5|Good High Quality Battery Lugs.
B005VKLGUW|5|Works perfect
B001OMVCIC|5|Not too bad to install. I highly recommend running your air hose down capping one end then hooking it up to the deflated bag prior to putting the bag inside the coil spring. It is a pain to hook up the hose once the bag is in the spring. This would have saved me some significant time installing had I done it on both. Nice addition to the truck easy to change ride like I wanted. Partnered with the rancho ready lift coils truck sits up right and is fully adjustable.
B007Q8EQP4|5|Just what I wanted. Perfect, fast,
B008RHKYIQ|5|Read a review about these plugs and ordered a set.  They are great and the bike runs smoother and cooler.
B00JK322MW|5|Not only are these super sturdy and heavy duty, but they also come in a handy carrying bag to keep your trunk neat! Well made and long enough to easily stretch between two vehicles.
B002XM5G70|5|Thanks for the super fast turnaround.  Not something you can go long without during camping season!
B00144CZ1S|5|I'm not sure why the price for this is so high, but it does a decent job according to my yacht cleaner. Haven't heard rave reviews, haven't heard complaints. When someone stole my Shurhold handle and scrub brush though, I was pretty disappointed when my yacht keeper replaced it with a West Marine that does not telescope down to stow inside our back hatch. Will be buying another Shurhold replacement, West Marine version will be our backup.
B00W4B54GS|5|Amazing product, exactly the same as the original.  Program was a breeze, since I only had one working key I brought one to program and did the other one myself with the seller instructions.  (If you want to program them yourself make sure you have two programmed working keys.)
B00YWGJYU0|5|These are great. Easy to install, and much brighter than the factory bulbs. They make my car look a bit more modern too.
B0076I23FY|5|nice
B003NZ71A6|5|Good value for the price.
B00B9ZKDMA|3|Great product and fairly easy to install.  No bracket to attach the wiring to the bumper though so don't forget to order it separately if you purchase this product.
B000IYH4RA|5|This is the one to buy as opposed to the Gates. Bearings are SKG made in France. Belt marked &quot;Made in UK&quot; which is where the engine is built (Northern Ireland). Gates belt seems OK but bearings are Chinese and won't go the distance. Don't ask me how I found out...
B00GMRM54E|5|Great lights and easy install. Now I can see where I am going at night.
B008D2VS9Y|5|Works great fit great
B00NOAJK1S|5|The lights were perfect. The only problem with the daylight running lights on Buick Park Avenues is to achieve the lower output, the lights are switched to series to where only 6 volt per bulb during daylight running. The LEDs' won't fire at that voltage.<br />Later, I'll do a work around.<br />Once completed, I'll re-order the lights.
B00GSAUHB8|5|Fits my 2015 Toyota Highlander. Pleased to say that the car feels cooler when I have this on during the day in sunny El Paso.
B00HESESX6|5|Performed as promised. It takes more force to push down than OEM; so you cannot be slamming the hood down like some people prefer when closing one. At least I wouldn't have to worry of the hood ever hitting my head for a long time, because even one of these can definitely hold a steel or aluminum hood up easily.
B005LTZL4U|3|Came and we thought it would be great and what we needed. Come to find out it had a broken wire. Could not use it!
B00KZ2YBRG|3|Seem cheap and did not work as dash replacement bulbs. I've returned them.
B000UKHD9Q|5|Best deal I could find.
B000EQ7A9O|4|Actually came in a Murray box, but no matter. Quality part. If you live in a hot to warm climate, get the severe duty. It's worth the extra money
B00B2AF2YG|5|I'm happy with this product is really good my Jeep now drive better handle better on the road
B000E287U4|4|Great product!
B004VBEDZ2|4|typical campaign sticker
B000CPCBF0|5|Rally good stuff highly recommended
B008EECXSQ|1|this item did not have a chain to it so yes it is a bad product
B00027H0QI|5|Great
B00U5M8AEG|5|Received this product very quickly. Nice product.  Easy ordering.  Definately order again.
B00W2XDNF2|5|I really love that I can keep me windows cracked while it raining
B00N42Z4R0|4|Was an exact match coil but turns out I didn't need it. So I have an extra one.
B0023VES2A|5|Fast shipping. Perfect description. Completely satisfied. Would order again.
B00967294S|5|Very impressive,extremely happy,great locking mechanism,great quality
B007GME2LI|5|They work very well and are well made.
B0002NYDYY|5|No more &#34;yuk!&#34; After many years of doing it the old gooey way, packing grease into bearings by hand and fingers, this device is fantastic!!  Follow the directions, insert and secure the bearings, attach your greasegun, pump it up, voila!!  Fully greased and you're still clean!  It'll last a lifetime.
B001S8CXJY|5|The best
B004R32TG4|5|Worked fine
B005WXP1RW|1|The strap broke on these boots after wearing three times. Suprised at the poor quality Alpinestars out out there gear is usually pretty good. Had to return them
B0082GG9FO|3|It came as the picture and descropitoon
B0017LUZVU|4|These are a very snug fit, but a little tricky to put on - the bolts are easy to cross-thread, and in general you have to put the bolts in after install. If you have a lift, vise grips and some jacks it's not bad, but it would be a nightmare working off a creeper. If you are in a hurry I'd stick with the good-old U-bolt clamps.
B00ZYCUDBK|5|great tool to have
B005ES5YMM|1|Don't fit 2wd 03 expedition
B000C59XKG|1|Well they were to small maybe someone put a larger sway Bar on my Jeep wrangler but they did not fit.
B000EDQQEC|2|It is streaky and leaves clouds - you really have to brush/rub it off which is something I prefer not to do on a RV.
B00LG0YSYC|1|They have been in my truck a week and already don't work
B00GQ3D3HM|5|Used when I added LED taillights to a flatbed truck. Still not sure they were totally necessary but the flasher works just as it did before
B000C5BN2W|5|Factory part, 2K miles on sensors and no codes, etc.
B008VQ0RSU|5|Was exactly what I needed for my 2001 Jeep Wrangler. Fast shipping
B00TKQJZU6|5|looks great on our bikes!
B006N91C2M|5|So much cheaper than going to a battery shop and a great product, would have no problem buying again.
B00B5PII1M|2|Does not fit my 2000 Honda Accord. There is simply not enough room in the brake assembly to install these devices.
B004EIAADG|5|Great product, all round performance, starter, compressor, 120v, 12v and USB outlets.  If only it could make coffee, oh wait, I can plug my coffee maker in, so I guess it does, but, make sure you order an 18AWG extension to go with it.
B006QXJ27M|5|This is the best D-ring to get.  Having the backing plate makes this more secure and able to have a higher load rating by spreading the load.  Best value!
B002T3IICI|5|It does the job
B00EI6CKVE|5|This sticker is awesome!  Too bad DIL won't let son put on his car.  Very unique....I have only seen one other while driving all over the country.
B008OOMGBA|5|I like it, even gloves have not hard protection I like it because I was looking for gloves that help me in hot weather and these ones works very well.
B002MESVL2|5|Awesome product
B001G73152|4|Not made in germane
B002QCT4AC|5|Ordered 6 of these for a 2008 Odyssey Minivan. NGK makes the best spark plugs you can buy for your Japanese vehicles. Was the same exact part that came out of the van. OEM quality and performance for a fraction of the price.
B006G3W418|4|Reduces spills for me, as clumsy as I am!!
B00BITJM4W|5|Exactly what I needed and easy to install :)
B00NM6N2WM|2|The color temperature of the LEDs was more blue then I wanted. I wanted a pure white. I rear dome LEDs are going out a I requested a replacement. However they want me to ship them back the old defective one before they send a new one, and shipping is almost the amount I paid for the kit. Plus in the meantime until I receive a replacement I wouldn't have a light at all. I think it would be wise to request customer to send a photo of the defective part and field destroy it with proof of another photo. Requiring the customer to pay expensive shipping of a broken item voids the benefit of having a 1 year warranty. Mine lasted 6 months. I would recommend buying from superbrightLEDs.com
B00UWNBZ72|5|Amazing jacket. I wear an XL t-shirt, but the Large in this fit me just right (maybe a tad short in the sleeves, but that was better than being all bunched up in the chest).<br /><br />The only thing wrong with this jacket is that it arrived folded over in the shipping box, thus the back pad was ripped at the bottom. I have contacted the seller, Motorhelmets, to resolve this issue, since it is just a defect in the individual item.<br /><br />The pads are soft and not stiff while riding, which is nice for the short trip to work or a long weekend ride. The 4 front vents and 1 large back vent provide enough airflow on the hot days here in California, which was one of my main concerns buying this jacket.<br /><br />I don't have enough stuff to put in the pockets, but there are plenty of them! The hi-vis yellow is great because in my opinion, it looks stylish, while giving that extra visibility boost. I can't wait to get a pair of compatible pants to zip up to this awesome jacket. Then I'll really be ready for the long ride.
B00AM1Y3X2|4|Priced good, and hopefully it lives up to the marketing.  You can register your vehicle for protection if it is below 125k.  However, if you use a different viscosity than recommended for you car you can't claim anything.  In AZ I run 10w-30; the manufacturer for my car states 5w-20.  This temps over 115 I run thicker oil for better protection.  Everyone agrees that 5w-30 and 10w-30 are superior to 5w-20, so I can't take advantage of their engine guarantee, but then again, I'm less likely to have an engine failure because of a better grade oil.....  I'd rather not deal with the hassle of a failure and engine claim to begin with.
B00JEUHVXG|2|The fit is terrible.  Especially the cargo mat, there is a good 1 to 2 inches all the way around.  the squares that i'm assuming you are supposed to cut out to reveal the tie downs don't even come close to lining up with the actual tie down mounts.  The cargo mat is also a much lighter weight material than the floor liners... which I may add are barely liners, much more just like mats with lipped edges.  Fit is poor all around.  The rear seat liners are the only decent fit.  But even still not great.  I've had husky liners for my other car and they are much better.  I will be returning.  Too bad, I had high hopes for these.
B00GYTEDRW|4|Good filter from FRAM to replace the OE cabin air filter. But the instructions are not too clear. Firstly they're not complete and secondly there's no indication of the air flow direction through the filter. I had to view the YouTube videos on that. The dark or charcoal side faces inward so that the external air first encounters the white pleated side i.e. White side faces towards the firewall.
B0046GF3SS|5|Great Product
B0007RDVH0|5|Works well, would like to see larger bottle
B000CO7LL0|2|Fit eventually!  I had to Dremel out excess welding material from 75% of the bolt hole edges just to barely get them to line up with the holes on the heads.
B0064RIIIE|5|They just look so good on my outlaw 525s. Performance is supurb. Thanks guy for the fast shipping.
B005GXPXVM|4|Good price for a cord like this. Hope long term use at our campground proves this to be a good purchase.
B00144BIC0|4|Easy to install and works great
B00FEE53FO|5|Excelente
B00J594EGI|5|works great
B0009IQZH0|5|great
B00VQ3MSN2|5|nice
B0009GZNHA|5|Filter is  identical to Honda filter, easy to install, and works well. This is the 2nd Purolator Cabin filter I have used. In fact, I have used Purolator filters for oil and engine air for more than 50 years with great success.
B008G2ONUW|5|These headlight assemblies were a great find for my wife's older mitsubishi.  We have tried to buff the original headlight lens multiple times with no success.  I figured when I bought these I would have to purchase lamps as the price was exceptional.  Instead, the assembly is complete with lamps.  Easy to install and as good as the original.  They are great, I would make this purchase again.  Mitsubishi parts are generally very expensive.
B009EA9LM0|4|This mirror in stalled easily and was a perfect match. However the clips for the outer shell of the mirror dont line up with the original outer shell. So if your mirrors are color patch paint then will not be able to re-use them. You will have to take the shell that comes with the mirror to be painted, cut all the clips off you old mirror and glue it in (not even sure that would work) or deal with a black shell that doesn't match the driver side
B00AQ3AI08|5|excellent, original to my 2007 honda civic exact color taupe / ivory 100% recommended product.
B008NRX20M|5|good
B001CUNFGI|1|1st order went well good stuff, now they can't ship it to California
B00EECXAY8|5|Cord works perfect.
B000FBUICO|5|It's Great! Great price and just what I wanted.
B000E7BBL6|5|Good deal
B00E9HWRK6|3|it was ok but did not have raised edges which I wanted, kind of hard to cut it to fit my truck.
B0049GECZU|5|RECOMMENDED (EXCELENTE)
B00PUYDV98|5|Great product. Worked perfectly!
B00MMLJ0BU|1|Unfortunately, only of them worked. :-(<br /><br />Seems a little pricey
B005JKEREQ|5|perfect! just as explained
B00VOAROM2|3|I primarily ordered this to overcome a low speed front end wobble, however it has had no effect on this issue.  That may be the fault of the tire however.  I do sense that at speed the tire seems to behave better, and I will try the beads in the rear wheel to see how they perform.  The only negative I have picked up from others is that if the beads become subject to any moisture, they have a tendency to stick to the inside of the tire and not disperse.
B00AGY3I6S|5|Looks great on my car!
B00SZPDISI|5|Fits right, looks right.
B000BYEMMW|5|Perfect fit for my 1997 Altima. Same or better quality than OEM part. Bosch is a well known brand
B00JAAFH40|4|added some 3m tape cause it was'nt enough,good carbon quality.
B0009IQZH0|3|Texture feels weird.
B008MM53BY|5|This part is keeping my very old Hoover alive and well and working as good as the day I bought it.
B008F8WGMO|1|The picture is misleading. In the description it clearly states its black only. However, seeing that battery connections are red and black, its very easy to make the mistake of purchasing this item thinking you will get a red and black boot.
B00LAAVJ9A|5|fixed good
B001GN2C1K|3|Make sure you read the details on this product and your vehicle specifications. If your vehicle does not have a tow package, do not buy this. You will need to buy the kit with this and the relay harness or your trailer running lights will not work. Note they don't sell the relay harness separately. You could end up with 2 T- connectors like me.
B000CNB4U0|2|Purchased for 2008 Chevy HHR 2.4l LT<br /><br />They worked great for about three weeks then started to &#34;slip&#34;. The sway bar could move side to side. I tried to tighten the bolts *uber tight&#34; but no luck. &#60;&#60; either they are 25mm bushings on a 24mm bar or the slotted mounts do not allow for proper compression on the bar&#62;&#62;.<br /><br />Bushing appear to be firm +1<br />Never a fan of gold zinc plating :(<br />Slots are much larger than OEM spec.
B004YJTIRO|5|Great item
B00BJCHTFW|5|really a great way to put tire black on !!
B004ZVZNPM|5|First off, these are very bright and I am very happy with their output. Just an FYI these will not fit natively in a '91 Mazda Miata as the square map lights on the dash. If you bend the terminals out to the right size you can squeeze them in.
B0006302PE|5|Fit perfect.
B008RITS78|4|Just what I ordered.  Good fit
B000WK111K|5|This stuff is amazing. I can't tell you how great the black on the motor looked after using it.
B0002SRCZQ|5|I received CV Boot banding tool on scheduled time. Worked great simple to use. I like this tool because it's not bulky as other units. This is extremely helpful in confined applications.
B00CUAWEUM|5|Beats clay any day for detailing.
B0067UD0NG|5|Good quality hub assembly, came with the sensor and all clips for assembly and cable management.
B000MKLQVK|3|Great bondo hardner for doing on site furniture repairs that don't have a red hue in the color.  It's kinda hard to ensure you have enough hardner in because the grey colored bondo doesn't change to a lighter grey
B00OXZEUK4|5|been working just fine. no complaints and everything going smooth
B00BH16GMW|5|Awesome
B005O0QQ1S|1|They did not fit my pickup and I need a return shipping label.  Would never buy this item again
B00B51UL52|3|it is perfectly matching withe car and color despite some small scratches found when open the package<br />the quality of materials just ok..
B001OMVCN2|5|Works great.  Wish instruction were a little better but got it install pretty easy.  Had a bad filter on mine and they overnight end me a new filter.
B0064FXRWI|4|I happy with the color but it needs more watts. Feliz con el color pero necesitan más watts.
B000B8GAPK|5|I had a check engine light on until I purchase the little cap. After a couple of days of installing this little fellow, the check engine light disappeared and never returned. This is what I call Quality. I love it.
B0002KKKAS|3|Some information about system lights on on dash board not included on index and hard to find
B000C9FSH4|5|ACDelco, best product for my car
B001V8U12M|5|Works Great
B00BP2HRIA|5|good set
B00BYH6C1E|4|As most reviewers have already said, it works.<br /><br />It's been a month, and I think they may be fading, because they look kinda brown against my black leather seats now.
B004MGCPB0|5|Great product easy to install makes my truck bed look like new.  Looks like it will hold up to all types of loading conditions
B00LPSOAX4|4|excellents
B0050HJNW4|2|Upon first use, the pin bent a little bit.  Not the end of the world, but I was disappointed.  All in all, I pressed out two rivets successfully.  Upon peening the rivets on the new master link, the peening attachment shattered on the first rivet.  Pieces of it shot wildly around the garage.  I only recovered two of three pieces.  It seems that the design of this attachment is just too small and weak for the job.<br /><br />I'm sending it back for a refund tomorrow and trying the Motion pro Jumbo next.  Wish me luck!<br /><br />I've seen a few mentions of a failed drive bolt.  It doesn't say this in the instructions, but the threads of the bolt need to be lubricated prior to use.  Any type of oil or anti-sieze will do.  Reducing friction at the threads will reduce the amount of force needed, which will probably save the drive bolt every time.
B00029XC1I|5|Great price! Love the bonus small stickers! They are perfect
B00180JENA|5|SAME AS MY OLD ONE.
B00AZMICOY|2|I am flabbergasted that anyone thinks this keeps liquids cool. Sure, if you fill it with ice, it stays cool as long as the ice takes to melt. The first clue is that you can feel the cold completely on the outside.<br /><br />If you can feel it that much I wonder how well the container is keeping the temperature steady. Answer: it isn't.<br /><br />I went to 7-11 and bought one of those giant cooler cups for $7 and it stays cold about 24 hours.<br /><br />This stainless steel waste of money keeps cold water cool - without ice - for about 6 hrs tops.
B006H1BWTO|5|Great quality and fit exactly the way they describe them
B00U7PTWZ2|5|very nice sticker. looks fantastic on my car
B0049USCVG|1|I just ordered this a few days ago and was not sent the high quality Dorman handle. I was sent the $5 handle I had previously bought on Amazon that only lasted a few months, before breaking and becoming inoperable. I thought I would spend a few extra dollars to have a better quality product, but unfortunately received did not receive the advertised product.<br /><br />The handle is not a perfect fit and is cheaply made. Long story short, you are paying close to three times the price for same cheaply made part.
B001PYCGCK|5|Part was easy to install and worked perfectly. I just installed it so I can't speak to it's longevity.
B00XQJMVTU|5|perfect
B00HAQBEH0|5|Handy Dandy little light!  My husband really liked it and uses it often!
B00FEH27V4|5|Nice......

B00CZL1GNC|5|Delivered on time and was happy with the product
B0000AY2Z6|5|After reading all the reviews on this fan I came away with this general conclusion.  It is a high price fan compared to other 12v fans but it does move significantly more air than the lower price ones and is fairly low on energy usage. Sound level will be about that of an air conditioner fan.  Good built frame, chinzy fold out fan legs.<br />I decided for my application this was all acceptable and what I was looking for so I bought it.  Here are the results:  It does make about as much noise as an air conditioner fan on the low and medium settings so if you are sensitive to white noise this fan may not do it for you.  The reality is these fans are designed with a radiator fan motor so yes they will be noisier and have a slight whine to them, if they designed a 12v fan to the standard 120v hosehold fans it would be even more expensive.  In terms of build quality I agree the &#34;legs&#34; on the fan do feel a little flimsy but if you just take the time to genly twist them and set the fan down gently they will last just fine.  If you are rough handling the fan then don't be surprised if they break.  The enclosure itself is pretty durable and the fan blades appear to be light clear plastic but if you don't stick anything in the fan they will be just fine.  They do appear thin considering the amount of air they move but I use this fan in a van when I am staying overnight fishing on a lake and it makes it comfortable in the van.  I can put it on a small table next to the bed, put it on low, and have it blow on me and sleep all night in 85 degree weather.  As with most reviewers I seldom need to use the Hi setting b/c it really does move a great amount of air on med and low.  When I have needed an extra fan at home to blow air across the living room I hooked this fan up to a 120v converter and on high you could feel the air 15 feet across the room.  It was a little loud but playing video games on big speakers, who cares?  I have also experimented using this as a window fan hooked up to a 12v solar panel system I have at home and it works great.  For me the med setting is what I use the most and the amp draw is about 1.89 , actually better than the cheaper little fans at big box stores that move less air and use more energy. Overall if you need a fan that can be used on a 12v solar power system or car camping, that can move a good amount of air, and don't mind the sound of an air condtioner, then this fan is worth the money. If you are someone who is looking for a 12v fan that has the perfomance of a household fan, buy a  dc/ac converter and plug your standard household fan into that.  You really aren't going to find the same perfomance on 12v.  But this one comes as close as you're going to get.n hooked up to a 12v solar panel system I have at home and it works great.

B008S9CJZO|4|Was a gift. Was told it's OK, fits good!
B00HTV2GSM|5|Really works!
B009S94RK8|5|So far so good. Fit my 2009 Chevy Malibu just fine. Easy installation and matches the originals.
B007KSZQU4|5|Easy to install.  The exact dimension of my original air filter in my Onan generator.  It should be real easy access to any air filter on these Onan generators.
B000IBEOQ2|5|I used this product and J-B Weld to reseal an aluminum boat fuel tank that was priced at $644.00. This product is relatively easy to use with good instructions, word to the wise, follow the instructions. I found three more leaks that I might have missed and when you have to cut your deck to remove the tank you don't want to miss any spots, especially when you have to fiberglass everything back in place. This manufacturer also has three videos available on line, I would highly recommend you take the time to watch them. I'm expecting the Fuel tank to outlast me. Also this is supposed to be adequate for a twenty five gallon tank, mine is 33 and I had plenty of material to do the job.
B000GVCTL6|4|I have a 2005 Yamaha Zuma, the muff came in the time they said it would. Part went on quickly and fit ok. The only problem was with mounting the new bracket on (the black triangle thing) it didn't fit my moped. So I had to use my old bracket, and I still only got 1 of the 2 screws on. But I think I got the bolt tight enough to make sure it is locked in place. I also reused my old bolts because the bolts that came with this are small, cheap and require a hex key, which is a pain in the butt to deal with. I would recommend picking up real bolts and using a power tool to speed up the process.
B000OCKJDW|5|Great addition to my tool kit
B001AWLTX4|2|Very sticky on your face I do not use it anymore
B00B8X3JPQ|5|Great product, fair price.  Installation of the fog lights were super easy (just remove the grille), the fender lights were a little more involved because you have to clip a couple of plastic rivets between the fender flares & the lining.  I liked that Crown supplied replacement plastic rivets, but not everyone has a rivet gun- which you really need to finish the install properly.  I really like the way the lenses look (pix attached) & they were plug & play
B00NQ45AA2|3|Seat covers are held together with glue instead of stitched. Not exactly ideal material for a car that reaches over 100 degrees on a daily basis. They started falling apart within a month. Steering wheel cover slides when you turn if you aren't gripping the wheel so you cannot turn using the palm of your hand. Get a lot of compliments on the designs.
B00X8PGUU8|5|I love it!!! INSTALLS REAL EASY..... JUST BE SURE TO USE YOU CREDIT CARD TO GET IT OFF so it will not bubble!!!!!
B00TGIPYMQ|4|These work fine however the material is extremely uncomfortable and the polyester is not soft at all (not that I had very high expectations). I bought these as a gift for my boyfriend to put on his leather seats in the winter in CT and I know that he will probably only use them when he is desperate for that extra heat because the material is such a downgrade compared to the leather seats. But they were inexpensive and still serve the sir purpose so I'm fine with it. Make sure you buy a cigarette adapter if you buy more than one seat cover!
B00ELASYIA|5|Great product and price!
B00DJG80YA|5|i needed these for my door speakers, shipped QUICK. They also have lots of holes around the ring so you have lots of options for screw placement.
B00FT9UPMU|5|Adds a prestigious look to my Durango! Crisp ' n clean look!
B006TMLFUW|5|Perfect replacement for 2009 Ridgeline
B000HDF7Z8|5|NGK Fine point iridium plugs are the best for any asian vehicle.
B000WMQ3LG|5|It fits just like the original and at much less cost! Shipping was fast & pricing was good.
B00LMHT2YK|5|This a great window sticker.
B00D42AFS8|4|Very useful. Long lasting battery, with two USB ports enabling to charge my iPhones.<br />Doesn't have an adapter for the lightening port though, but regular usb chargers can be used.<br />A bit heavy - nice to keep in the car for emergency
B004Z1JG6Y|4|They fit the old 1995 Escort just fine. Swapping out the complete strut is pretty sweet and at these prices it makes sense to do that.
B00AP8WU1Y|5|Used a few times, but holding up well. Noticeably better water quality with this filter over the slightly cheaper one. Fit my Cameo Evo filter housing.
B006L7PORU|5|Product is as advertised.  A+++
B007VUXP1S|5|Worked perfectly on rack. Strong and durable.
B002IV8CI6|5|just what was needed
B010C31FZS|5|I would recommend this product, fits just like original and at a affordable price!
B005CCJABG|5|The brightest flashlight I have ever seen. Small compact design, and lightweight. Excellent price would recommend for anyone that wants a quality product.
B00V30J86I|4|We bought two of these. One works great in our Chevy Cruz but the other would not onstall into my mothers Hyundai
B000E35UVM|3|Not an exact fit as the original but worked great

B000RNY6OG|5|Works great for a back step

B005KVLX50|5|Got to my house early, everything was there, all parts work and I'm happily hauling my kayak around safely!
B001KS8724|5|Very easy to replace broken mirror
B000BUQOEU|5|WORKS GREAT, KEEPS THE AWNING FROM FLAPPING
B00VABLQ42|5|Perfect, fit, looks and price.  Quick delevery
B0013REXO8|4|Fit very well and really accentuate the look of any jeep. Stands off the light assembly well and installs easily. Just have to keep the two different sets of screws straight. Overall a good product!
B00B0DGRF8|5|Very nice!  A lot of people here say it's too small and it's for kids, it's not!  Fits really nice.  I ordered two pieces (smoke & dark grey lenses) so I have a reserve if ever one gets broken because I thought they'd break easily but they're actually really good quality sunglasses considering the very cheap price.  Two thumbs up for this!
B0085FE53A|5|Love it, I use it to hold my keys and people comment on how cute it is.
B004LELTLK|4|ok
B00DBLIQUQ|5|Awesome
B001CEJH5W|5|Same fitment but better built construction than oem style. Amazon by far has the best price for the best product.

B00A8MZ7EY|5|does a great job as a it says using the spray lubricant was eaasy less drag than you get in the cheaper material kits from auto parts store. picked up way more than the 100g meguireres i compared it to which was more money on my end. fantastic product and will be a repeat buyer
B000JFJLP6|5|This has saved me jump calls several times over harsh winter of low auto use and drained battery.  Highly recommend.
B002OJ9YR0|4|Could have an adjustable break away cable
B00GW9N49C|5|great parts thanks for fast service
B00E9W2PPS|5|arrived as indicated
B0095IDSHA|5|Works perfectly. Just as good of a signal as my original antenna (which later became bent and needed to be replaced).<br /><br />Really easy to install. Great product for the price.
B00WXNFY0I|4|Just right
B0009KMH20|5|This is it. Buy it. The best.
B00QREL2PA|5|Worked beautifully on my 04 Silverado 1500 Z71. Very easy to replace. Remember, let tailgate half way down and pull up on passenger side of it and it comes right out. After that 4 bolts per side and you're back in the game. Mine had rusted out pretty good. Feels like a solid gate again.
B005FTW69E|5|THANKS .Everthink is okey.
B007ZCQD9S|5|Installed on my V-Strom 1000 Motorcycle. Without a doubt this is the top upgrade to my bike
B00JJX1TA4|5|Thanks for having this item works great
B0002KKIXC|5|I have used this several times around the house as a spot cleaner.  It's always done a great job in that regard.  I have a 15 year old SUV that I would like to keep forever, and I was considering having it reupholstered.  This past weekend I thought hey, why not see what this stuff can do with the carpets, since I have nothing to lose if it ruins the carpet in some way.  I sprayed the carpet generously, let it sit for a couple minutes and then scrubbed with a nylon brush.  Bottom line the carpet looks great, almost (but not quite) like new. I will still go ahead and replace the leather seat upholstery, but the carpet won't need replacement!
B0055AW0N0|5|Can't believe I waited so long to have more cup holders! Secure. Works great!
B006G52A7O|5|Just what I was looking for. Love the easy to read blue light.
B000XFLTAW|5|Got me to sturgis comfortably
B00BOVDCPE|2|It appears to have shrunk/warped from the summer heat.  I don't keep the tag in the holder unless I plan to use it.  Very difficult getting the tag in or out now.  Throwing it out.
B000BLMJKC|5|good price  hopefully they will last
B00MIDXG4Y|4|I probably should have gotten a different style because the round tube is hard to adapt for a front upright support...
B000GU3KHO|4|Its a well priced cover with all functionalities. I ordered an XL and  It fits my Ducati Scrambler very well. I recommend to everyone
B004L0AC5I|4|Did the job with no complaints.
B00LBP43FG|5|Really bright and easy to install great product and would purchase again soon for the rest of the billboards I plan to light up
B0024GW2XQ|5|excellent product, very comfortable
B008VSB0DE|5|THANK YOU.
B003KU68MQ|1|Not even worth 1 star. One broke left me stranded.
B008G2B1KM|5|Exact fit on a 06 Silverado. But I had to drill out the top holes to get the locking pin through. Also had to beef up the bottom tabs with some electrical tape as others suggested. This was a great purchase and so much easier than cleaning with a $30 kit. You can't go wrong. Plus, bulbs are included. Seriously, this is a great replacement.
B001HRLL12|5|It was exactly what we needed for our boat trailer. We replaced our old worn out Identification Light Bar with this new one. Looks and works great. Glad we found one that was the exact same size as the old one.
B0036VRQ70|5|Worked as it was advertised, highly recommend, much cheaper than a head job.
B005R3SRX2|5|Best organizing socket rack out, my snap on guy charges ten dollars more each rack. I don't told everyone at work what I get them for on here and now I end up buyers my them for everyone............
B001UOND90|4|LOVE THIS PRODUCT BUT ONLY THING I DONT LIKE IS THAT CABLES FOR JUMP STARTING VEHICLE ARE TOO SHORT AND EXPOSING YOU TOO CLOSE TOO VEHICLE  WHEN USING JUMP STARTING CABLES AND ALSO UNIT TOO CLOSE TO ENGINE
B0001XPC4K|3|Display is so little
B00JX88RV4|4|It didn't really fit my seat, I was unable to tie it but I still like it.
B0056YS5IY|5|nice brake pads-fast service
B00802GIW4|5|Perfect
B000NOKNK0|3|These are very functional, but they are ugly which makes me less inclined to wear them. I think I'll probably get a helmet with a visor for when I need to wear my glasses.
B00BYGM6I8|5|Very comforatable feel underneath my feet. I don't feel like I have to constantly adjust my foot placement as I did with the original pegs.
B000B66UUW|5|perfect fit.
B005OURSVU|5|Looked to be &#34;the original&#34; equipment in every way.  Worked well too
B005LA03TC|5|good product fast delivery good price
B00JW1WYR0|5|Fit my 2008 F-150 XLT perfectly. Easy snap on installation
B0066RKVL4|5|Works perfectly!
B007Y87T1O|5|ok
B00JIGZXMC|4|I'm guessing these don't have a regulator like the &#34;full size&#34; LED bulbs usually do as they get fairly hot. I'm using one as a center stop light so I don't know how it would fair as an always on light. Very bright and perfect for a center stop light since it has emitters around as well as on top.
B000W0RQ8C|2|Appears to be a good product however, it is approximately 3/8&#34; too short to be used on my 2010 Tundra. It does not state the length so ultimately it's my fault. You may want to research the dimensions before making a purchase.
B00BYH6C1E|5|GREAT.  GETS JOB DONE.  LOVE IT.
B000C42STA|4|Be careful tightening these down. We managed to strip the threads on one of the bolts. Other than that, they went on my 2002 WRX just fine.
B004Z763IM|5|Item is as advertised.  They work great.
B000FPZX6G|1|Been waiting for ever and only got 1 in the mail
B000H87M9M|5|Works fine, allows me to connect my Camp Chef stove directly to the RV propane
B00COGX39I|5|Very small and they work

B0023VE104|5|Amazing product, great price for a replacement turn signal.
B000760FWU|5|Lightweight, easy to use.
B00HJEGQQ2|5|Easily three times brighter than its incandescent counterpart. Here is a comparison between the two. The LED bulb to the left and the incandescent to the right. Also produces a clear flood-like beam for a wider and more fluid view out of the lens. More important than brightness is the clear instant-on and instant-off for signals. Just be sure to use a resistor to prevent hyper flashing since the LED bulb requires such little power draw.
B00PXC5PNC|5|Great for the money...
B00WJPGSD2|5|This thing is bright.
B007D1BK30|5|Good fit
B0036R6PNU|5|Lifted my Daytona 675 just right. Had it on the stand for 2 days while i got the tires mounted and balanced. very sturdy once the motorcycle is on it with matching rear Venom Rear Stand.
B00B3P26N0|5|Sticker is still holding on during aftera year.
B005GM4DR8|5|Theses mats are officially from Toyota and they fit my 2009 TC perfectly. My car feels like new again. Shipping was fast which was a plus. Definitely recommend these.
B001KR5MQO|5|After being extremely unhappy with a set of ARANA lift supports, I decided to try these because in photos they looked identical to the OEM ones that were on my car. When I received them I was a little disappointed to find that the connectors aren't what was pictured or like the OEM lift supports, but the connectors they did have do work with ball mounts and the lift supports were identical otherwise.<br /><br />Whereas the garbage ARANA lift supports opened the trunk at full sped and slammed it into the fully open position, fit loosely one the ball mounts, were too long, and rubbed against the trunk lid, these fit perfectly, and they slow the trunk down as it opens so it gently comes to rest in the open position. They are also Made in USA. So far I'm very happy with them and wished I had bought them first. I do wish the product picture showed the connectors they actually have, but since the fit and function correctly, I won't hold it against the,.
B0023VKXAG|5|As advertised
B0052U9WKC|5|Very good!
B00YORTQOG|1|Terrible! They do not fit. Header collector hits bottom of block and oil pan. Kit came with two different size header bolts both in witch were wrong. Standard thread not metric. Tried to save a few bucks and ended up biting me in the ass! Only good place to put these is in the garbage can!
B00GHT8TQA|5|I earlier reviewed the 521-723 (Driver Side) but put this one (Passenger side) on at the same time.  I noticed the oem one's rubber was beginning to crack (after about 280,000 miles) but putting this on made a significant difference in steering and handling.  10,000 miles on these now and couldn't be more pleased.
B002ICGNUO|5|using it for a few months now and still looks good.
B000E7WLJW|5|Well made, heavy duty fabric, easy to attach to carrier. 14 hr. drive in the rain, everything inside was as dry as a bone, very happy with it.
B00JSJMTE4|4|Nice feel and look for my son's 02 Mustang.

B007ZJNZKG|5|Great product
B009XIU7F8|5|Fantastic way to add range to your dirt bike if you don't want to spring for the price of a desert tank. Watch your chest if you're planning on jumping though.

B0073JCVF8|1|I Simply Love Frogs and ALL items with them on it ~  BUT please Do NOT purchase these if you don't want to spend a Large amount of money replacing your valve stems ~  this is the very first negative review I have even written in my life!  After these were on my car tires it was harder and harder for me to take them off ~ taking it to the dealer to have my oil changed & check the air in my tires, they had to CUT these Cute lil froggies off and replace my valve stems at $30 a tire and labor ~  I was not very happy and wished I had never bought these :(
B00311XJB2|5|these are identicle to the stock ones and has the same Yamaha blue color and comes with all the plastics for dirt cheap
B007MUY7MI|5|Works exactly as advertised. Very easy to install.
B008S9PIXE|5|Just the correct amount and type oil needed for a full size Sierra, Silverado, Tahoe or Suburban's Air compressor. Air compressors come with 8 ounces of this oil inside the compressor. This keeps the clutch and other moving parts of the compressor in good condition while it is working. The input holes for adding oil is underneath the compressor. To access where the oil goes, the compressor (part where the clutches turn and where the belt fits to the pulley turning the clutch) must be un-bolted and turned upside down to access the two bolts where the oil is added. If hard to understand then Google: Adding oil to AC Compressor and watch U-Tube videos.  Remember this is for full size Trucks 1995 to 1999. Maybe others too, If unsure Google your model and read
B002MF2EJG|5|They look great and came quick.  Exactly what I needed.
B00T36HLYU|5|These are great and fit exactly as described.
B00NAOIQOK|2|I liked the black matt finish but did not fit in my 2007 gti mk5 like advertised. The locking tabs on the back side of the emblem didnt line up or fit the oem grill. I ended up plasti dipping all my emblems. They turned out AWESOME!!! No more spending money on upgrades or modifacarions that dont fit. I gave this a two because I like the vw logo.
B00069CN2I|1|Two right mirrors.  Returning.  Arrived day before leaving on camping trip, now stuck without mirrors.

B0011DZSKM|5|The Fuel Pump I ordered met all of my expectations and at a fair price ! The shipment was done in a very fast time and it contained everything that I needed except for the wiring harness which I had to order later ! Thank You
B00AC45PZ4|1|I just purchased GMC The wheel center stickers put them on and One fell off as I was driving the same day I put them on well can I get a refund if I lost it on the road
B00523AMBC|1|I Don't like it, doesn't filter chlorine . Wasted money, have to buy another one
B00A0IZF3E|5|High quality stainless, easy to clamp onto bumper and bright LEDs.  I wired mine to the directionals which works great.  The only con was the wires could have been a bit longer.  I had to splice in extra wire to make them long enough to reach the wire harness so I didn't have to get to the back of the headlight assembly.
B00KJLM21U|5|This will be a birthday gift for my son.  Feels well made and I know he will love to display it:-)
B00D9GZSF4|5|Worked great at those traffic lights that would not change.
B001KSAB7S|5|Although it says Ford it fit my chevy tahoe mirror perfect. I was not able to remove my old mirror glass because of the heated backing. So I just used  E6000 clear adhesive to glue it on top, worked great. Saved me lots of money
B0009IQXXG|5|nice shiny finish
B005C5SLSQ|4|It's really pretty .....  But, there's only one!!!
B00A9WH0K2|5|This fit the Polaris 4-wheeler perfectly. My husband was amazed because he didnt believe me when I told him I could get a better price online and it would fit. This came and it went right on without any problems! We are very pleased with the product and the durability as well. It is not cheaply made and looks just like one you buy right from an auto parts store! Thanks!
B0073WGQG0|4|Great pricing, quick service!
B00KGGTF9U|5|Fits my Jeep Grand Cherokee very well. Folds up nicely every time. Have used it over a year now and it's very durable.

B003UM9GDM|5|just as advertised
B00AFW0HSS|5|The window trim from Putco truly enhanced the appearance of my Platinum 2014 F150.  I would highly recommend the purchase of this product from Amazon for anyone wanting a little more bling on their ride.
B000M8IF1Q|5|used this on a toro walk behind on the drive gears.. time will tell if there is any problems.. also used this on a couple of mower wheels as a lub.. testing testing  ha ha
B000JLNZ20|5|This is the best stuff!  Our bowling center mechanics get very filthy putting their hands into pinsetters that were built in the 50s.  They say it took many hand washings using the &#34;orange stuff&#34;.  But this product, with its crushed up walnut shells does a much better job.  It may be fairly expensive, but you don't have to wash multiple times to remove the grease, ultimately saving money.
B008VLVDII|3|The material quality is good but does not fit my Subaru Forester.
B0091OE6K6|5|Love these.
B00P7QIFQ8|2|Does not hold tight
B00DIPSA8I|1|I'm wondering if I got mine from a different seller than the folks that gave this 5 stars. It's a poor quality image PRINTED on some decal paper. I could've made this at home and it would've looked better. Also, despite the title using the word &#34;sticker&#34; it's not actually a sticker.
B007GMHTQ8|4|Good construction for the price.  Only issue is the connection u bolts are too long and protrude up into the support bars of the carrier.
B001ED8IMO|5|Exactly what I needed.
B007L2JNT4|5|Looks OEM,,,works great
B00MATVMC4|3|Kind of clunky.  But hey, if it is for storage and not everyday use it is fine.
B00JMBSAZU|5|Quality ONE product !!!
B001CA77BM|5|I installed it this morning, and wanted to leave a review for others who were worried about doing it yourself. I have looked at YouTube videos and read up on all the forums, but sticking your hand in there is a different story.<br /><br />Get a LARGE towel and tuck it up under the hose. I did NOT drain the radiator. There's only a little bit that comes out (Just get a gallon of Coolant and a gallon of water for post install. You do NOT want the coolant leaking all over your already soaked electrical components.<br /><br />After surveying where the hose was prior to the install, I thought it would be moderately difficult, but this was SUPER easy. Most people had commented to use needle-nose pliers, but the only tools I used were 1 7mm socket to get off the hose clamp, and removed the &#34;quick release&#34; hoses BY HAND. It doesn't get much easier than that. Just pinch the metal tabs and wiggle the hose... you'll hear and feel a click type release, and then you pull. Mostly it was easy because the hose was long, so there was plenty of leverage. You will have to reach all the way to the firewall (the actual barrier in front of the cabin) because there is an adapter (5 or 6 inches long) that doesn't exist on this new part.
B002MCVPOO|4|Works perfect. Pop the inspection cover and slide her in.. You will be air hammering your fan clutch in no time.
B005FL1E6S|5|Husband was more than satisfied.  This kit was complete and worked out to be cheaper than if buying separately
B00BTHQFMU|5|good deal ,fit perfect
B012NCW5BE|5|It fitted just right in my scooter. Thanks.
B0025QZMRI|5|Awesome! Glad someone carries it at a good price.
B0016LG0CY|2|This worked good on the first couple of days, but i had to change the fuse extremely fast because this did not keep my Interior lights going. But after 4 days this thing just went out. Tried everything to get it to work again. I advise you to get a better one a wal mart or best buy.
B007KFMQ00|5|Nice kit.. hope this stops the constant rotor wear we have had with our Terraza.
B000N9JUT0|4|good product
B0095XJW8Y|5|Great, Thanks
B002TTU96A|5|ITEM WAS AS ADVERTISED AND SENT PROMPTLY.
B00P6ONO26|5|perfect fit to replace broken light on my car.
B00LNOIU0E|4|Nice, strong, and look great. Instructions for installation could be better.
B000CCZ5BA|4|great shocks rides smoother than oem, however had them on for 2 months and are already rusting.
B004SG55MK|5|This can be a DIY but it is extensive and takes much time and advanced skill level. You MUST! MUST! MUST! use an electronic weighing refrigerant scale for charging this system and weigh in the refrigerant due to the dual expansion valves and this variable compressor doesn't stop turning. Do not run engine to charge refrigerant as this pump must have some charge already in to spin without damage! Watch the scale and charge quickly liquid to a vacuum, close the valve when you hit the weight. There is a yellow label for ref weight next to hood latch.<br />The best trick for this repair is remove the radiator and condensor first (Find the U-tube video for doing belts); here in is where the parts list increases. Fan needs to be removed; left hand thread!  The hardest part of the repair was removing the power steering pump as the rear fasteners of the pump are difficult to reach, just set pump to the side for access.  You will need: A new receiver drier, Pentosin SF engine coolant (three 1.5qt bottles concetrate (mix 50/50)), new belts, ac/delco water pump (because its better and is easy), Dayco tensioner (really are superior, you will see)some transmission fluid (lost from cooler disconnect). The ATF on the LR3 cross references to Motorcraft Mercon SP, you need 1/2 qt. TIP: you can add the 1/2 qt through the upper cooler hose with engine off as it is a drain back to the pan. Both Mercon SP and Pentosin SF are available here and O-reilly carries it if you need it right away. Another tip: there is a bleeder on top of the engine next to throttle body that breaks. YOU DONT NEED IT! just splice it 5/16 barb. The bleed is for initial fill so just pull those lines apart to get the majority of the fluid in there and then close up the splice up last when topping coolant. You will never use it again except initial fill. ...Oh and while you are there clean the throttle body, find the U-tube video for that too.
B000W0MOLQ|5|Good lock for my boat trailer.  Does what it should, its now several months old and has been subjected to Florida humid, hot , rainy weather and it looks no different than when I bought it and put it on.  The only downside is I use a Megahitch Coupler Vault when not trailering and this lock is a tad too long to fit underneath the coupler Vault lock.
B0000AY2HN|5|it is and does what it is supposed to~!
B006CTO0AE|4|What huge V-8 doesn't need dual exhaust? How in the world did GM ever design the puny 2&#34; exhaust system for these &#34;large barge&#34; cars? This manifold fits, is machined flat at the flange and looks pretty good. My custom exhaust guy said it points downward too much, he had to work hard to get the first bend just right. You will have to do something with the other manifold; cap off the &#34;unused&#34; port from the old crossunder pipe. This fit my 70 Olds 98
B00HDZ4UM4|5|[[ASIN:B00HDZ4UM4 Marine-Style Lead Battery Terminal Clamp 3/8&#34; Stud for Quick Power Connect-Disconnect]]<br /><br />The cables that connect my Renogy charge controller to my AGM battery have eyelets but the battery has posts.<br /><br />These devices solve the problem of how to connect.
B000JFNAJE|1|Some backround info, I am an Electrical Engineer and Journeyman Machinist with 15-years experience in manufacturing.  I work with industrial vacuum systems & pumps as part of my job as a corporate engineer.<br /><br />I bought this pump for home use on my cars R134A system.<br /><br />I have used this pump less than a dozen times since 2009.  Every time I have used it, I changed the oil with Robinair brand deep vacuum oil.<br /><br />The machining and seals on the isolation valve are poor.  The isolation valve body and valve core have sharp edges on the sealing surfaces which will damage the o-rings/seals.  This is because due to insufficient deburing after machining these parts.<br /><br />The Robinair brand replacement seal kit, contains o-ring seals that are NOT the proper size (diameter or thickness) and will NOT seal after replacement with OEM parts.<br /><br />Will not hold less than 500 microns (using new oil), due to leaks at the isolation valve.<br /><br />Also exhaust port tube is bent (from factory).<br /><br />Poor quality control and parts issues (vanes not available, and replacement seals don't seal).<br /><br />Without a deep vacuum gauge, CPS VG200,etc (not standard manifold dial gauges), you won't know that it doesn't pull a deep vacuum needed to boil off moisture in the ac system before recharging.<br /><br />Generic O-rings are your best bet to get the isolation valve to seal.  But the isolation valve design and machining is poor making proper sealing unlikely.<br /><br />Buy a different brand/model.
B00NM6Z52W|1|Bought it, got it, works and Mr. Tsang from Miami does not answer my phone calls or emails so there is no customer services.on this Jumper. forget about connect a solar panel to it

B00K3GBRQ2|5|Lights up everything behind you at night!
B001AGNBMM|1|This muffler lasted only a year and a half.  Just the case is stainless. My original one lasted ten years<br />Called Walker they told me it was because I did not drive enough…My car has 180000 miles on it,, my driving has been the same since I bought the car new …. I would have saved money buying the part from the dealer
B000EDUUIA|5|Product has been on garage floor for about a month.  I park a Tacoma there and this device works as advertised.  I looked at several other options (laser, tennis ball...) and I'm glad I went with this.  Low profile and let's me put the truck at the exact spot each time for the garage door clear my trailer hitch, no worries.  I'm happy with it.
B001CO2JGG|5|In addition of protecting from water and dust, it gives a great look when I open the hood
B00PGOD24G|5|It works great no problems what so ever
B00L7XCPU2|3|Great fit
B00HG4CPN8|5|Fit the truck perfectly
B001TI5IIQ|3|It works well and was not difficult to use, but after a few weeks I can see that a reapplication will be required in the near future.

B001VM6Q0O|5|Good quality paint! Good price too.
B001NZ0KXS|1|Came damaged
B001N4QY66|1|Only works in low light conditions and at close range.  I would recommend a better quality unit for anyone who expects to use it regularly.
B0006SH4HS|5|This stuff is the bomb!  I bought a very poorly maintained 2006 Cobalt 27' bowrider.  It looked like the previous owner NEVER cleaned the seats.  Full of mildew and just grimey everywhere.  I tried every vinyl cleaner from West Marine and nothing worked even with scrubbing with a stiff brush.  After watching a few YouTube vids, I ordered the Meguiars Super Degreaser.  Mixed 4 to 1 and a stiff brush, this stuff cut right through the grime.  The vinyl seats look new again.  You still need to apply some elbow grease, but this stuff worked far better than anything else I tried.
B0097MX0OK|5|It was great. Delivered in a decent amount of time.
B007WY74H4|5|Love it and looks great on my beetle
B00BWAODC8|1|Didn't fit 01 Tacoma like it said it would had to alter a lot to make it look right

B000C57Z9W|1|Did not fit my truck even when the page said it would.  2003 f-250.
B00GKRQ7DG|5|I was really excited but nervous because I didn't know if it would look like the picture. When it did come in it gave me specific instructions on what to do and how long to place the sticker on, in the end it turned out perfect! I really love the sticker it was totally worth it!
B009RBWI6C|3|This is a little difficult to stick on the windows and don't show up well if the window is tinted.
B006B376WK|4|It does the job well as advertised, as other's mentioned
B000UK1WYS|5|Very good copper plugs. I read that copper plugs produce better spark than iridium spark plugs. Iridium cost 3 or 4 times more. Difference is, iridium spark plugs last around 100,000 miles while copper spark plugs needs to be changed around 25,000 miles.  I get a smog check every 2 years and I always changed the spark plugs before smog check. NGK Copper spark plugs is just right for me. I have been using NGK spark plugs for a long time and it never let me down.
B00E5TR6Y0|5|The item that I purchased is perfect. As always, Amazon was great to use.

B00MYD635C|1|I should have paid better attention to the size. They are NOT the standard. Little things.

B00H4G2X94|4|Just as I needed. I eyed it up and it was the right one. Same quality and prompt shipping.
B00X1XAUH6|4|Very bright. Best blue lights I've seen for interior of this size. Only issue was the heat shield on the back fell off too easy on the first one but I just glued it back so it's not a huge issue. Still very pleased.
B0013FU1WS|3|It is ok
B00BD4SIXI|5|Easy to apply. Been on for months with no issues. Looks 100 times better than stock dull pillars.
B007TY002S|5|Perfect fit
B009DJQBAC|4|Shipping was great and the quality on the grille is good for what I expected a cheap Chinese grille to be. Was surprised that I had to glue on the T and A...all the other letters are right in the mold but those 2 are in a baggie taped to the back of the grille. Probably to avoid being slammed for a reproduction of a Toyota part without paying for it but either way have some super glue on you when it shows up.
B005VLCKSI|5|Good as new!  Easy to install and back to new looking in a few minutes!
B002P8SXLI|5|I own a toyota corolla 2003. It was a great product. I accidently ran my old one into the side of my garage. It was not pretty. I shipped the mirror over night. It is just black and I thought about getting it painted but I was so desperate. I just place the thing on there. It looks great. The video on youtube helped me install it. I was really happy!
B001BB4LBG|5|It was durable, easy to put on and perfect color. Thanks
B00ANZHG7C|5|Must have for cleaning your home. I use these for mirrors, counters, tables, everything really. These are good quality.
B00PHHNXTG|4|One of the leds did not work straight outta the box but the rest did they are bright
B000JZIICI|5|Installed in 1997 Explorer 4.0L OHV with a squeaky synchronizer. Arrived quickly, works great, doesn't squeak. A word of advice, if the new one does not drop right in. use a socket to rotate the pump drive shaft. I taped a 1/4 drive deep socket to an extension, dropped it in the hole and turned the shaft in small increments until the synchronizer fell in.
B00UMR23OW|5|Great bulbs as always this is my second set from this company and they are decently bright for reverse lights on a 94 c1500
B009YR00MI|5|Took this thing camping. ran a small fan. charged a phone and a laptop. worked great.

B001O07TAO|4|Does its job. Fits well.
B000JWGG1Q|5|Great hitch, installed with no issues at all on my 2003 Chevy Silverado.  Curt quality can't be beat - and amazon prime shipping a hitch is just ridiculously too easy!  Towed a boat successfully, hitch didn't fall off - 5 stars!
B00FTTVW54|1|There might be the slightest performance improvement, which I am skeptical, but it's surely quieter than stock exhaust. Not worth it
B00K6PUKKY|5|Love these magnets!
B0023VIFJC|5|Very Happy!
B000IYYTUK|5|It works.
B003G9G4X4|5|Works like it should.
B00OA66IG0|4|more foam than a spring break party
B000C545I6|5|Tip to install to techs...dont tighten them up while the car is in the air. The rubber is gonna twist when on the ground and shorten its life. Rec. Put them on leave them loose and once on the alignment rack tighten and adjust as usual.
B00KTITCRU|1|Quit working less than 2 months if you send me a new one I will give a 5 star review
B000CN7IZ0|5|Love them. Easy to install
B00Z7KIZPA|4|I really like this.  It looks gimmicky, but when you have someone in the car with you, they don't want to hold your purse or have it at their feet.  This solves that problem.  When I am by myself, the purse is in the seat.  When someone rides, it's in the purse pouch.  Glad I bought it.
B0010Z4MDK|5|Saved me a lot from what they wanted at invisible fence as a back up battery replacement
B000EA5WLS|5|It works...use as directed...fixed 2 'starbursts' with this kit and have plenty left over for more repairs.
B000XG8Q0W|4|Easy and functional but if you want to keep the rubber ends on them, give yourself a minute and pop some glue on them.  Otherwise just accept the fact that they'll be gone almost immediately.
B001DH4C3U|5|Perfect fit
B00BT1GXDW|5|good
B0044GNBRK|5|Worked perfectly; mechanic had no issues with the install.  Ordered Hardware kit as well to make the job as easy as possible for the mechanic.  Window now moves up and down smoothly, and is much quieter than the (now) 19 year old unit in my 1996 Ford Explorer.  I'm very happy with this product; a true good value.
B000JZIXNM|5|excellent price. fast delivery. can't go wrong with this.
B007TWOK4Y|2|The shocks are garbage. Put this on in December 2014 and already have replaced rear shocks as bushings disintegrated. Coils seem to be holding up ok.
B00B2YE4B4|5|Works great
B005S4F9MW|5|I am delighted by this tool. It is easy to use and works great.  Now I can wear all those shoes that were a little too loose!
B003H6SPZG|3|It holds my license plate fine, I wish it had come with instructions for installation.
B00LUZB9LI|1|Broke in two weeks.  Doesn't hold anything
B001HATY36|5|Is as described.
B00JID6RXY|5|COOL & True
B00DP5ZKG6|5|Works great. Installed on my 2004 Jeep Grand Cherokee. I've had it for a few months now and the first several days my transmission shifted hard and acted like it didn't understand fully what was going on, but after the computer learned the new parameters it shifts so much better now and doesn't lolly-gag into different gears like it does when you upgrade to larger tires.
B00S4HFGUA|4|Great product.
B00DZ54I7I|1|Elastic strap broke the first week I used it
B00651CIL2|4|looks good on my truck, installation was very easy, didn't seem to affect my reception. solid piece but seems to vibrate more than the stock antenna,
B00ALI2NRO|5|As Described
B0006IX878|5|Hooked up, no leaks, works great! Real impressed for the price considering retail stores want $20 bucks for this same product!
B00BQYCKE8|3|Leaves some residue but good for inside cleaning. Purchase the Gian Waffle 36 by 36inch microfiber towel instead.
B00EPDLHBO|5|Go Noles!
B007KFMG7I|5|Great purchase at a good price.  No noise, great!
B006IIZXC8|1|did not fit my schwinn bike
B00UN2JVQO|5|They are great
B008SAVKF8|4|Like
B00266994Y|5|The lift took a lot longer than I thought it would. Really wish the instructions were a bit more clear. Truck stance looks great and the ride is basically the same. Maybe a little more stiff in the front but that's what you get with a body lift.
B00V0CAFKM|1|Looks nothing like the pic
B000NVW1LM|1|not work for my car
B00J7XYZXE|5|Bueno
B004I6APUM|5|Great product. Perfect fitment. Installed in less than 10 minutes.
B00MC6RQAM|5|Excelente
B007PE06DK|4|Delivered earlier than estimated and still working great after 4 months.<br />Update: stopped working after 2 years in time for prices to more than double due to the heat.
B0096J90KW|5|works great
B00JWG0UG2|5|Purchased these to hook up to a motorcycle for better illumination for night riding after a friend turned me onto them (had them mounted to a Jeep). For the price, they are well made and plenty bright. Take note that there is a spot light (focused beam) and a flood light (spilled, wide beam) versions. I chose the flood since I hooked it up in conjuction for use with my high beams. Turns dark into daylight! The supplied mounting materials aren't bad and it also appears that you could screw into the aluminum heatsink housing (there are threaded holes towards the top in the rear). If you are looking for a quality light for not a lot of money, I suggest looking into these!
B000BUQOEK|5|They worked well this summer for us.  Kept odors to a minimum.  I subscribe to these and save money.
B00ZR1DF6I|5|SUPER CUTE! I was so nervous when getting this that it would be flimsy or that there would be missing stones but my worry was wiped away when I got the package. The license plate cover comes in a nice sturdy box and surrounded by padding that would be perfect for gifting! There are extra stones inclosed as a &#34;just in case&#34; but we didn't need them. I love the fact that it came with little covers for the screws so the blingy look is flawless. This is a high quality product that I would recommend to anyone wanting to personalize their vehicle without having to damage it with stickers or other distracting items! I received this product at a discounted rate in exchange for an honest and unbiased review. The views expressed in this review are my own.
B00493UW5W|5|Exact fit for my '07 Lucerne!
B007JY79CM|5|Worked Great!!!  No more limp home mode......  They even give you the Gasket.
B000FN6PGA|4|Nice set,  but the larger wrenches are a little disproportionate to the driven fastener - longer wrenches (starting with the E12) would have been better.
B00482SD5U|5|Very nice, plush towels. After reading about color bleeding, I first soaked them in a bucket with a vinegar and salt solution (check the internet for instructions). That seemed to do the trick.
B00KRQMOD8|5|Looks great on my car!
B00OCHZBVA|5|Easy install (two wires) on a Honda Ruckus.  Alarm is sensitive but not too sensitive.  Alarm is also loud.
B005J1UK2I|5|high quality, heavy duty, reasonably priced
B00429Y8ZI|5|The solution to keep my car clean when smoking. The LED light helps on dark conditions.
B00G620ZVU|5|Pretty bright. Thx
B00UC4J5SM|5|Look great and easy to install.
B003LD1MUU|5|Perfectly content...product price and appearance just fine.
B002AYJUXW|5|Great switch... It has held up better than the other cheap switches I have purchased in the past
B000E28C7M|5|used them in the past, worked great
B003O78ZIU|1|Did not fit the 2015 mid-size Polaris ranger 570 crew as listed.
B00E16LU7Q|5|Excellent
B00UFWTKA4|1|wrong color
B00GSHHT8A|5|Same as OEM :0)
B00U068T7A|5|Quality at its best! A must if you're running 37s on your JK and doing some extreme wheelin.
B00UTXU4L8|5|Very high quality.  Used on an '86 ford ranger that I converted to a 3 core Aluminum Explorer radiator for a 4.0 liter  Great product
B00HT9I0NE|1|The mounting brackets are not for a 2014 Ford Edge, so I can't use this product unless I receive the proper mounting brackets.
B000KEA1ZA|3|They look good. But not happy with the way they fasten to the seat.no cut outs for the back rest lever and up and down or the seat adjustment.
B00JH254YO|5|Works great.
B00144AH5O|5|This is exactly what I wanted to have. Thanks
B003BZD03K|5|No more leaks, the old unit started to leak.  Keeps the strain off the RV's water inlet
B005SI5SIS|4|ok
B00FSIN0U6|5|real bright outside and great price
B008BBV4HS|5|Good
B00COYNZJ8|4|Serves it's purpose in keeping my car cool when it's parked in the sun all day, and the design is pretty funny. It takes about 2 minutes for me to get it situated where it won't scrunch up or fall down, though, which is inconvenient. I drive a Honda Civic, and I don't think this would give full coverage in a car much larger than mine.
B001UC9QXO|5|MUCH BETTER PRICE THAN AT AUTO STORE 7 WORKED PERFECTLY
B0054RFLOO|5|Received on time, seems to be well made and fit like a glove.
B00BGD94W0|5|Excellent product and great seller to work with!
B00KW27X6K|3|Was not a good fit for my 05 VFR 800 but fit nice on the 600RR.
B00BCRMC1U|5|LOVE these seats, the only issue I've had is that the front seats don't have enough fabric to cover the very bottom of the seat in the back.  I have a Kia Sportage.  But, it's not a big deal and it really looks nice in my car!
B008FCGVDA|5|Nice product, thanks
B00FAICN20|3|The reflective lettering on this plate frame are fastened on with adhesive. While washing the car, the bottom of the letters caught on the sponge and started to lift off. I had to reinforce them by attaching some clear tape along the bottom of the lettering.
B00EQ29NLA|5|Great quality
B0010GCAWY|5|On time and no defects. Great price ....
B00OW0UAJA|2|I wanted to LOVE this key chain. It was exactly what I needed since I valet my new car often at work and around town. The style is sleek and sexy and the price is right too. It's easy to remove my car key, which is a remote. The problem? One of the screws came out, the screw that connects the metal to/through the leather! Now keys just dangle and swing from the leather because it's only connected by one screw now.  I bought it in late March 2015 so I have not even had the keychain for 6 months! I'm bummed because I'm not particularly hard on keychains. At least I don't think I am. I want to buy another but...will that one fall apart too?
B00N160W1M|5|Easy to put on - love it!
B00XXMLM8Q|1|horrible shut off valves.  Both of them failed.  One was slightly better than the other but both would allow gas to flow when shut off, defeating the purpose of having a shut off valve to keep gas from sitting in carb in the off season and destroying the rubber components, and causing varnish buildup and carb failure.  They also would come apart easy if twisted by pulling out the top.  The plastic body is very very thin and cracked easy.<br />So....did I state they dont work.
B010THS816|5|I purchased this remote cover to replace my 2 worn out 2004 Acura MDX fobs.  Delivery was quick and once installed properly works perfectly, looks good and a great fit.  The only issue I had was as delivered, a trunk button is attached.  So, you have the unlock button and lock button, which are both necessary and can be seen.  However, the trunk button is there too, but under the plastic as there is no trunk button area since it won't work anyway.  However, if you try to snap things together as provided, the trunk button being there (even though you can't see it from the outside) causes the remote to malfunction.  Once I figured this out, I simply took a pen knife and cut that button off.  (all 3 of these buttons are attached to one another on the inside).  After that it worked perfectly.  Wish they had explained this in some sort of instruction.  I was in a hurry when I did this and almost gave up.
B00CO8UIF8|1|The car charger is useless since the connection to the screen falls apart after about a day's use.  This happened<br />with two car chargers purchased from MyNetDeals over a period of 6 months.  Who makes these things so we<br />can avoid this?
B000IYB0RA|5|Great product...Great price!!
B000M5Y720|5|Makes all the difference over stock headlights. Those dark roads are no longer a problem!
B0041CDPQO|5|If you need an outlet for chargers and the like and don't have an extra outlet. This is a life saver. Simple plug and route to where you want the cigarette lighter location at. Just make sure you don't leave anything plugged in to it that will drain the battery if your engine is NOT on. Such as charging anything if your engine isn't on, it WILL use battery just like anything that uses electrical current ...common sense really, but just a heads up .
B00JG3OHVK|2|I used the product on brand new expensive &#34;Sunbrella Fabric&#34; upholstery cushions. Very disappointed and wish I had used &#34;Scotchguard&#34; instead. Problem is the pump sprayer. It splatters drops and leaks on your hand. I wore gloves to protect my hands and followed directions exactly. Tested the fabric first as directed for color fastness. Sprayed it on in direct sunlight as suggested for best results. It doesn't spray evenly!! After drying completely, there were spots on the cushions where drops were left after spraying. My gloved hand and the bottle were wet with the leaky product. Had I used Scotchguard in a pressure can, the spray would have been finely distributed as in spray paint cans. Don't buy it with the hand pump sprayer! Next time I'll go back to &#34;Scotchguard&#34;.
B000CLMMYO|5|These brakes pads installed fast and are quiet with good stopping power. No squeaking or grinding at all and seems to work great. Great price too, thanks Amazon!
B001DH0QTO|5|RECOMMENDED (EXCELENTE)
B001JT5OPC|5|Work just fine on my pop-up camper.
B004GCGJJY|5|While this is a third party, after market part, it fit fine and looks great.<br />Everything lined up<br />CAUTION for sharp edges on the metal, but nothing suprising<br />Recommended
B00CJI637U|5|Works great.  Installation was easy.  Be careful when using with low cut shoes or flip flops.  Hit my ankles a few times on these.  Does not feel good.
B00G9W9O3C|1|It is cheaply made.  The zippers broke on the first use.  Lots of room in it though.
B000C9GO8G|5|Worked perfectly. Good value compared to other options.
B00EZ85XKK|5|Looks as good as other WAY more expensive ones.<br />Great Deal !!
B000OCT7FI|1|good  tool  for  small  tires
B000CACMMM|1|The first time I used my new carrier the zipper broke apart...luckily I did not travel through any rain.
B00MA9NR0O|5|I got it for my boyfriend and he loves it. It is what I expected for it to be. I was happy with it.
B004E26BPS|5|Perfect fit for 2008 jeep liberty
B000C2U7O0|5|Great water pump and fit perfectly! Glad I got this one and took the previous one I got back to AutoZone because it just seemed to a be lower quality part.
B008QRYC4O|4|Fits and looks great!
B003UT085U|3|I have &#34;mixed&#34; emotions on this product. I have used better and have used worse. When I use it on my new Camry, it comes wipes off easily and then they are time it wipes off hard. The shine is nice and what attracted me to it verses McGuire's or Mothers is the price. One gallon for uner $30 bucks; whaaaaaat
B005VKLGUW|3|Worked great. Thanks
B000COMX3Q|5|Great locks, works great on my Jeep
B001AMA2VE|1|Defective part. Waste of money to buy and install.
B00HJCJE04|5|easy to install, all I needed was a scrrewdriver
B00496Z394|4|That who's the problem with my car but it works good
B00T9AGBOQ|5|excelente producto
B00T37FWPY|1|Static notice, cheap materials
B00S72PBLG|5|Love it!  It fits nicely on my Kia Sportage steering wheel! I love the bright colors!! It shipped quicker than expected and it indeed glows in the dark!
B000C2Y660|1|does not fit a dodge ram 2500
B001IBBOB4|5|Thank you.
B00QVQ4HMO|5|Well made with lens screwed on for easy bulb replacement.  Good product, shipped and arrived on time with no issues.
B00877TP4K|5|Ok
B001TPUCE4|5|Fit well works well installed easy
B005AUONAS|5|excellent
B002J837PG|5|For years I had pretty much given up on &#34;glazes&#34;... too often the results looked as though the car had been rubbed down with pumice and lard. I'm not a pro car detailing guy, just an enthusiast who has obsessed over car care stuff since I was kid in the fifties. Chemical Guys lists this product and the nice Black Light liquid as glazes. But along with Blackfire Wet Diamond Paint Protection, they do a lot more than just hide imperfections. I have a small collection of cars (a couple built when I was in the 8th grade) with all sorts of paint technologies. No single product is perfect for every application. But on some of my clear-coated paints, this Wet Mirror seems to offer the most impressive shine of anything I've tried. It reminds me of discovering Meguiar's Competition Finish 45 years ago, or Westley's Velvet silicone polish a decade before... mostly long-forgotten products that stood out in results with the lacquer and enamel paints of the era. CG assures me that Wet Mirror is free of abrasives or strong cleaners; one of my factory clear coat metallics looks new after four decades, hope to keep it that way. I do wish CG was a little more informative about the composition: polymers, oil emulsions or silicone? Is there a useful definition of &#34;nanotech&#34;? But it's good stuff, just ordered a backup supply. Hard to go wrong with the best of CG (and Blackfire).<br /><br />Update: Just found that Chemical Guys 5050 paste wax applied over this Wet Mirror Finish gives a really nice, deep shine. Especially like the combo on dark colors and reds.
B00IXCQZ1K|5|This product arrived ahead of stated delivery. Thank you. Product was installed easily and quickly and matched color in my car. Wife is really happy to have fully functional console cover again.
B00686V4H8|1|After market was not up near desired quality. Poor quality!!. About half of original thickness. .Not worth placement and not worth shipping back.
B001FAM3JK|4|little trouble mounting but all worked out...... they look great and make the step for my wife manageable....
B00BFE5VQS|5|The replacement Floor Mat retainer is made and fits like it was factory made. It was a simple matter of popping out the broke one and popping in the new one. Super fit!
B00WAHAV1Y|5|what I wanted
B00FJUZY8Y|5|Love it!
B00BYH6C1E|5|does what it is supposed to
B000BWCG90|3|VERY HARD TO CUT
B001AMA2UU|1|Had this installed on my car ($220) only to have a god awful clunking. 3 mechanics confirm it's a defective part. Save your money.
B00F7GXNX8|4|Good sticker,I by it again.
B001H494DC|4|Works well. If nothing else it will make someone look for an easier tarket.
B002UD0GGS|5|I haven't used it yet, but I'm sure it will be good since I have used Novus 1 on my Misty tool.
B00AVQSFY6|3|Does the trick - there are better ones IMHO.
B000LE6AXG|4|Not the greatest thing since it is just a vibrational massage in three areas. But for under $15 it is worth it.
B00J3ZNBQI|5|Exactly what I expected. Works ok in my 2015 Ford F150
B0027XGIKO|4|Difficult to fit over handle.
B000C7YR46|2|To high priced....
B00TBHXC4E|4|Nearly none of these protective sprays seem to disclose the ingredients, which gives me pause (especially around children).<br /><br />A mechanic once told me they're all basically the same silicone spray. I can't vouch for that. However, I can say that 303 seems to do the job as well as anybody. And it works with a wide range of products, not just marine, but also automotive, and any vinyl you think might be subject to UV degradation.<br /><br />However, this is nearly twice the price as equivalents such as Aerospace & Lexol (which can be found just about anywhere, including hardware stores, Walmarts, and here on Amazon).<br /><br />Also be aware, if you need a lot of this product, many companies (including 303) have bulk options available for large projects. For example, here on Amazon, the 303 gallon jug (128-ounce refill) is just 43¢ per ounce (vs $1.13 per ounce for the small bottle). The Aerospace is just $44 for a gallon just (just 34¢ per oz - a 70% savings). Both of those gallon jugs currently come with free shipping on Amazon (and be aware the prices on Amazon change frequently).<br /><br />Good luck!
B000DZQQYG|5|good price
B0066COA8Y|5|Gift receive before delivery date. Recipient was delighted as he had an eleven hour drive home.
B00PQNZILM|4|It fit our 2015 Ram gas door perfect!! Great quality.
B000BYGD4W|5|I had previously replaced my spark plugs, distributor cap and rotor (which definitely needed replacement) on my 1998 GMC Sonoma high mileage truck but was not getting the gas mileage or performance I expected.  After installing this coil all is well.  I like ACDelco parts.  Also, Amazon has good prices on vehicle parts including oil, etc.
B001OBHACK|5|fits 1998 jeep xj perfect. bolts and everything is included. PERFECT FIT. I had stuck caliper one day and I bought this the same day. I know have great brakes and no more sticky calipers.
B00O39TPDM|5|👍
B00MQKTFG2|5|Exactly what we wanted and works perfectly!!!!
B000T7HE7Q|5|I used this on my boat trailer.  It was easy to install and are noticeably brighter without being obnoxious. I have yet to put the boat in the water with these on, but I am told they are waterproof and they do look to be.
B002TO86NS|3|The system headset works for listening to music or conversation but the mic does not work well at all above 40mph. All the wind noise picked up was terrible
B00DTNGVLM|5|Looks great on my truck
B000EDST1K|5|Works well. Stops the stovetop from rattling while moving, because it has some rubber type backing. Didn't need to be permanently installed like some others.
B005PPZJQU|5|I love this unicorn decal! It was very easy to apply and has lasted quite a while even in the hot South Florida heat. I was worried the sun would bleach it but its still as pink as the day I bought it. I would definitely recommend this product!
B00GDCQXO6|5|Well made and easy to work with. Installation is a breeze when using the right installation method. I highly suggest you visit the 1060graphics.com website to watch there installation video if you've never installed any type of stripes or graphics before. If you've ever installed stripes or large graphics before, this item will be very easy to install with the same methods and techniques.
B000Z0HVHA|5|Works great perfect length
B00NLMF7XY|5|Everything as expected. Shipped very fast.
B00ZYJS28E|5|Very sophisticated  cigar case.
B000OF9LRO|5|Sweet, just as expected
B00MB0ESDC|5|fits well on visor in car.
B0068C2BJM|5|Pricey but works great
B000KIVPME|5|What a sweet creeper!  This thing is solidly built, and has great wheels.  Very comfortable for my 180 lb. frame, and I think it would work fine for someone of greater size.
B00386UI82|5|Very easy to install.  They made my 4Runner have a lot less body roll.  Time will tell if the brackets rust.
B00H1I639Q|5|I just installed these lug nuts on my 2013 Jeep Wrangler Unlimited and there are a perfect fit.  They look much better than the stock lug nuts which just have a thin metal cap over the actual nut.  Because the DP Accessories nuts are solid without a thin cap, they are slightly longer due to the end not being a thin cap.  Also, the stock lug wrench fits these new lug nuts just like the stock nuts.  A picture of the stock and new lug nuts is below.  I would definitely buy again.
B0010ADJIE|5|Really nice, good feeling relay.
B00F8UE1KM|5|Satisfied.
B00P2VURDM|4|installed without a hitch. satisfied.
B000E7WLKQ|4|It helped with reassurance over my car top carrier.  It was difficult to put on our car tightly, especially because our car is tall.  Also, the little hooks were hard to wrap around the rails and put the hooks in the tabs.  However, we just hooked them on the rails and it worked fine.
B000GVGUR0|5|nice sistem,fit rite in,fast shipping,i love it
B000637TNM|5|Ive been using this product for years....This was a great price!  Thanks!
B005LQ7PEM|5|Perfect for my use, moving items from my storage section to my art studio.  Roomy shelves, light weight and easy to maneuver.  Excellent value for the price.  Very sturdy, nice looking too.
B007PLZGO2|4|Great gift for my brother, the new SUV owner. He is happy with it, and only suggests that there be some kind of instructions so he knows if you put it inside the rear window, or outside. He said he couldn't tell, and didn't want to possibly damage it when installing.
B005Q13BI6|1|After 2-1/2 months stopped taking a charge.  Seller required &#34;self return&#34; so it costs as much to ship back as it cost to purchase.
B00TA62M1K|2|Fit did not work correctly. The tabs that insert behind the chrome strip are not thick enough and did not hold the cover in place. Very<br />disappointed. Would not recommend this product
B00APK3LBA|5|Replaced all my 12 v incandescent lamps in my RV. lighting is very good and now my battery lasts longer between charges.
B0096TRDZG|5|Great, easy to use, easy to attach, very pleased, even comes with an alcohol wipe to prep the surface. I needed something to hold a monthly parking pass and this fits the bill.
B00IORFL96|5|Great modern look for my bike! Took some time to get it set in place but very satisfied!
B006X8C81C|3|Nice build quality, however it did not fit my 06 Altima SE R. I had to modify it and fabricate my own brackets.
B00I5RXLAG|5|Great product. New. Just as described. Needed a replacement light for the one on my trailer. Works great
B00GI1N502|5|The screw driver is exactly what I wanted.
B00UPAPAIW|5|I got this for my daughter's first ar....she loves it so does all of her friends!!!!
B00F7GY7ZQ|5|Love it in my car!!
B00SP31VVG|5|Exactly what it says
B008I7NEN2|4|Fit was decent. Not as good as factory but for the price I'm satisfied.
B000EDQQD8|2|Lowers the pressure too much.
B00AMPHLIW|5|perfect fit . toyota camry 2014 le hybrid.  easy to install .. read or watch youtube guide
B0016IJ0XS|4|Fit well and replaced the broken one.  Works perfect now in my Pontiac Vibe.  Much better price than the local auto stores and chains.
B000I04Z7Q|5|This product is amazing, I have ordered many things from Amazon and Online, I have never been more satisfied with a purchase.<br />These lights look great, they are super easy to install, I actually tucked everything away inside with only using 2 zip ties total.<br /><br />Due to some other negative reviews, I feel the need to comment on the length of the wire for each of the individual lights. They are PLENTY lengthy, I put 2 under my dash, and ran 2 under the backseat of an extended cab Silverado. Mounted the control box on the drivers side of the center console, giving maxing reach to all sides of my vehicle, a lot of people say you can't reach under your backseat, but it's about placement.<br /><br />I hope this helps, and good luck with your LEDs!
B00AOC9HVC|5|Al 100...
B0053SKJAK|4|I am satisfied with the idem but he did not come with any instructions of any kind.  Would have been 5 stars if it did.
B00GSAUHB8|4|Awesome! Don't buy any other sun protector, your search stops here.....
B00DNL05GW|3|The slots need to be bigger. I can fit a polarized plug in both receptacles, but it is a very tight fit.
B00B2YHFO2|4|Two out of eight didnt work but the ones that did were very bright
B00LBNL3VK|1|Didn't work as replacement for front parking lamps in 2005 Mercedes E500 (W211).  Error message appeared on dash display and lights flickered on about once every six seconds or so.
B00BITLNAS|5|Timely and correct!!

B00E0UH20W|5|Better than great perfect fit quality A1.
B005C43YHU|5|This worked perfectly!  My  truck bumper looks like brand new - was so easy to apply !!!
B00S4HFNXK|5|Due to being flat and how they fold these store in a nice tight spot.  Great for a small boat where space is tight.  The grommets are nicely protected by plastic to protect against corrosion.  These flat &#34;bumpers&#34; provided more overall contact than ones with a typical oval design.
B000C8T7LS|1|Let me start by saying this is a functional manifold and it does fit a 98 Civic EX.  That is about the only good I can say about it other than the pictures don't do it justice.  See the holes in the manifold?  Now see the ones in the gasket?  My OEM Honda manifold had holes that match the gasket perfectly.  The ones on this manifold vaguely resemble the ones in the picture and are not even close to the gasket.  The result?  Lost power and increased heat.  My Civic that had run dead even between hot and cold for 17 years now runs hot after more than 10 minutes on the road.  Pop the hood now and I am greeted with a blast to of heat. Maybe its the fault of the heat shield - I should have recycled the original - but it can't be good that hot exhaust is being vented from the block and instead of meeting a smooth path from block to pipes it hits four oddly shaped hunks of metal partially blocking the way.  I have no doubt those bits of solid steel are red hot under there from having exhaust blasted on them.  To make matters worse I put this manifold into my Civic one day before giving it to my son to go to college so now he has to drive it very carefully until the semester is over and I can swap it for another one.  My fault for not opening it up and looking at the holes until it was time to replace the cracked one.  Zero chance I can return a 6 month old manifold with a couple thousand miles on it so I am out the $120+ for this.  I will be ordering an actual Honda OEM version to replace it and pray that heat does not destroy the mounts in the mean time.  Oh and did I mention the funky 13mm bolts they decided for the heat shield?  Don't buy this unless you want to shorten the useable life of everything under the hood.

B001AY2WLU|4|its super small but my husband loves it
B00C4B1F7U|5|I think it took me about 15 minutes to install the hitch and another hour to install the electrical.<br /><br />I originally bought a Toyota hitch from the dealer for over $650! It came with 20 or 30 pieces... required the rear bumper to be removed and cut and was just a pain-in-the-ass. Luckily the dealership was kind enough to let me return it and I bought this one instead.<br />I couldn't be happier with that decision.
B011WH09HI|5|Vary awesome add on too my challenger..
B00316QNTC|1|Broke on first use.  Sent back with a big turd in it.

B0096BAMA2|5|I went to replace my radiator this summer, since in the winter time (2014) my ratio of water and coolant were off leading to some overheating and what not. Replacing the radiator wasn't a hassle at all. It fit right in! I didn't even have to take the bumper off or anything just work your way through the car.<br /><br />-It worked for my Grocery Go Getta: 01 Honda Prelude
B00DSOL3OC|5|I purchased this switch for my 2008 wrangler after my factory switch began acting up on me. It looks and feels in every way like the factory switch. It was an easy install. I had to remove a few torx screws, lift off the plastic steering wheel shroud and it plugged right in. The total install took about 30 minutes.<br /><br />After a few months the new switch has worked flawlessly.
B0067EZ7JC|5|Great well made, and good looking product! The picture is black but the description is clear anodized, and I'm happy I made the mistake, I thought I was ordering black but I like the brushed silver look much better!
B006RW5NNY|5|Works great,  looks OEM, flows nicely with the stock grill.
B00S7UIVJ2|5|This is also great for your Harley too fits in saddle bags and dont take but 6&#34;x2x3 space and it has you covered for your phone/ipad/radio/dvd/JUMP START your dead battery and your bros bike.good item for this price and if you get a bad one AMAZON WILL TAKE CARE AND GET YA $ or another ,not that its happened ,but they will.

B00CMMVUOO|5|Work good so far
B00F7S73KU|4|at last I can have a framed license plate and it's nice. couldn't find it @ the dealership so I amazon it. nice
B004AQYXQC|1|I replaced one trim cylinder on my boat and this was a perfect fit.  After a month in the water I noticed oil leaking.  I pulled the boat out today to discover my new cylinder was leaking around the rod seal.
B00REXL1DQ|1|I would have given these LED's a five star rating if they were still working. I purchased six of these  in May and now three months later two of them stopped working. I contacted JDM ASTAR and was told if I want a replacement I have to take the led out and mail it in then once they process it they would send me a new one. This is not acceptable. I spent $30 on 3 sets which probably cost them a couple dollars to make but they want to give me the run around to get them warrantied. If they would have sent out a replacement they would have received a better rating but I cant recommend a product that breaks after a few months!
B00480KOMW|5|Perfect
B000BW8NYC|5|Finally someone built plugs for those of us with header clearance issues....works exactly as advertised!!
B001DCGP6M|2|Plastic cover won't stay in place.
B000CLQNPI|4|These brake pads work great. I replaced the rotors at the same time Insure quiet and long life of the brakes

B00G09AB9A|4|It worked as expected. Problem solved.
B004PXAUGC|5|Finally got to use 4 of them in my truck ! Work perfectly no issues. Note: take your time installing and cutting off the leads that you don't need

B000CGT2BU|5|No dust great stopping!!!
B00E1ZRTEA|5|love it
B0054YCW62|5|Very happy that I found this ..... at a good price.  It is small enough to toss under the back seat of the truck, yet seems to be sturdy enough to hold down a good load!  (I have not actually used it for anything in the back of the truck yet, so not positive of its strength.)
B00LNQBQLW|5|easy plug no fuzzy mess, works like a charm love it!!
B00AGNUUX8|5|Had them over a month and they still nobody has noticed them. That's a good thing.
B004CRC352|5|Great assortment of wire heatshrink. Shrinks as it should and appears to be of quality rubber. Comes with the nice sorter as shown in the pics.
B000UKDRY6|5|Exactly what I needed. Exactly what was advertised.
B00CBL1E8I|4|Works perfectly.
B00E64XAJE|5|The part fit nicely and the price was right.

B011CQSQHO|5|Yes absolutely wonderful and really look awsome on my riding jacket.
B000EQ74BS|5|This air filter fit perfectly to my car I love it.
B00Y1AYWSG|5|Cute, different and unique. This was exactly what I needed for my steering wheel as it was starting to get sticky in humid weather.  And, although its not insulated, it still gives a little protection to the steering wheel when my car is parked in the hot sun.  Love it!
B0028R5ELI|5|awsome
B00651CACY|3|Short signal
B00171V262|3|Won't be using them just yet, I bought them as a back up item all appears to be OK.
B005N53C9I|4|Couldn't figure out how to put it on my seats are first but I went to try again and it went on fine. looks a little chunky but its not a problem
B00KWYL77Y|5|GREAT.  LOVE THAT IS THIN.

B004HMBK5G|5|Works great!
B00B1GEK2Q|5|As described just what I needed
B0074MS2RU|4|Good but  scratches off easily if you don't take care.
B00A3UNYW8|5|I use it every day. Works great
B00NK9E3O2|4|instructions aren't great. I can certainly see why some people complain that they don't fit or that they break. They do fit, and can be installed without them breaking, but you are likely to need to have the experience of installing 3-4 sets to achieve this. The rear ones go on easily, just put the clip 2&#34; from the rear rather than 3&#34; and everything fits and stays. The front however have a flaw in the combination of instructions and design which almost insures that you will crack some of the flange that fits behind the weather stripping next to the mirror. The bottom piece of the deflector needs to be kicked out, way out, to prevent the window from pushing on it and cracking the flange. The biggest problem though is that the plastic pushes pretty hard on the chrome trim on the window sill and could mar it depending on how you install it and/or from all the road vibration. Time will tell.<br /><br />All said and done, you only beed to install it once and probably won't be taking it off, so whatever right?<br /><br />2015 cherokee
B007XRAL2K|5|Best price on MB power steering fluid!
B00VJ4LHUS|3|It's okay. I wish the material on the outside was a bit nicer. It's rough and stiff and my Kleenex box sticks out of the holder a bit.
B00JLFDSHW|5|Great quality
B001XUD46S|5|I had the same issues most people say they have the auto window won't go up. I had this issue with three windows. Come to find out I didn't have it install right. I was blaming the parts but in the end it's your own fault. Take a few seconds look at it. I had to take them out and move them just slightly and bam they worked no issues. I just put them on and now have the windows up for the 24 hour period. I'm sure once they stay up for that time they will even work better. These were so easy that they make you make the errors. I would say these work great and have no issues other than crappy installation. Great product. They will work on trailer mirrors for those wondering. I don't have them but a friend has the same ones and a tow mirror. I would suggest taking your time and you'll have a great experience. I think most people rush the job causing the issues they have. Would buy again if I had two trucks.
B000EFIT8G|4|good light with all needed parts.
B00DO04MTS|5|Husky Liners are awesome! Fit my 2015 Rav4 perfectly. Will definitely buy again
B00N24S1RA|5|Great Product
B00DSD5IVM|5|Amazing
B00APODVW0|3|I really like the look and overall build quality of this license plate, but one thing I didn't pay enough attention was the bottom edge doesn't have the low cuts at each corner for the registration stickers.  So my stickers are completely covered now :(.
B000C2GFOG|5|Excellent Set at cheap price.
B00B9J21QW|5|We use this jack on our camper trailer. It's not super fast but it is so much faster than having to hand crank the darn camper up/down when we're trying to load up and ship out. Definitely would recommend.
B005LQTC3O|5|Great product.  Install is a little tricky on the throttle side.
B00652G4TS|5|Works terrific
B000182ESM|5|Easy to install. Looks good on my 03 Chevy Silverado!
B000BUQODG|5|This vent cover is GREAT because no rain gets in. The vent cannot open fully, but if the vent were made to not open quite so far I would never notice. I did find that hot air seemed to get trapped under the cover which forced heat into the trailer. I resolved that by bending the brackets (with pliers) to raise the cover an inch or so higher. Standing water on the roof cannot get in because of the way the vent is built so the cover does not need to be sealed to the roof. There is a plastic mesh on the louvered vent on the cover that seemed to restrict air flow. I removed that mesh since I already have a screen in the vent below the fan.
B0041I0Y80|4|Nice Cup holder that will hold the larger bottles.  The only think I would like to see improved is more slots in the housing so you can have more option to making it sit flat.  What they have is very workable but on my handle bars is doesn't sit flat.
B0009IQZ1Q|4|Good buy
B002J7KE4E|5|Cute and nice material
B004A3284O|5|Got there fast but I didn't see it was only one<br />Would liked to get a warning on that
B005O022R0|5|It works very well and can't imagine the price!
B008TW15O6|5|Nice.
B00NF1QKW8|4|Great replacement for our original that broke. Fits fine. Only complaint would be that the habdle has to be squeezed to close. The oringinal just snapped shut much easier.
B0080HJL7S|4|This little trash bag wasn't anything what I was expecting. To be honest I was expecting something a little more cheaply made. I was actually surprised to see that this little garbage can looks like it can actually be used as a lunch bag or maybe even a small cooler. Two of my favorite features are the fact it has a handle on it so that you can hook it over the head rest in your car and it has a Velcro closure so you can actually close the trashcan and keep it closed. This is one of those little products that you don't expect much from but once you get it it was well worth the time and money spent getting it.
B0012TPVC0|3|meh. I didn't think it was all that great.
B0015AC9QC|5|Great Keychain
B0084DNXWC|5|Works great.
B000WJCL56|3|Signals work fine, but these do not fit a Kawasaki Ninja 250R (2007)
B00NUJ2HRW|5|Ordered parts came fast and was preceded by an email with detailed instructions on how to install the parts. Well above and beyond my expectations. Ford dealer wanted $42 each (2) plus $20 each side to install for a total of just under $130. I bought this set of 2 for $32 received within 2 days and installed in less than a minute for both sides. What a score, and the quality is top notch.
B008OV4P1M|5|Good.
B002JFEETW|3|Not for everyday use; cheaply made, no bells and whistles. Perfect for what I wanted as part of a Blues Brothers costume.
B001UA0EZ0|5|I ordered mine Monday at midnight and got it in today at about noon... lots of padding good pockets.. removable sleeves .. I ordered a 3xl and it fits perfect even with the liner( I'm 6ft tall 290lbs.. wide shoulders) I would recommended it...
