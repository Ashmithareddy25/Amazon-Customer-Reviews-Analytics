B002W5X8PA|5|My nephew loved the pillow cover.  He's SO into everything \\"Mario\\" and now has the pillowcase on a pillow decorating his bed.
B0056ZAR8E|5|I lost my 180's that I had for several years so ordered these online - they are so much nicer, warmer and made from softer material than I had before.  Love them!
B003ZW1AEU|5|They are so very comfortable and they fit perfect. I ordered last week and ordering another pair today. I wear a size 6-8 and bought a medium and they are perfect.
B007VY7IXU|2|Did not fit well. Not flattering
B00LW5DGYE|5|I still love the jacket.  The sleeves are very long and had to have them shortened but the quality is wonderful.
B007IEG6W2|5|My son wanted to be a Mad Scientist for Halloween, so my husband and I dressed as his &#34;mutant creations&#34;---this tutu was perfect for my hodge-podge of animals costume---fit very well, was comfortable and cute!
B0079LZP1M|5|Not exactly a large backpack, but big enough to hold my books. Totally worth the cost and would recommend this.
B0018OT69I|5|The size is correctly, It fit very good<br />The material is excelent and color is like on web page, the quality is like my expectarions<br />It arrived on time
B00LVP9SEW|5|It came on time, and my son loves it. He's only had it a week, so I can't say how it holds up, but it seems like good quality. I'm happy with my purchase.
B0099MV2Y8|1|Much too small for a size 11.  Could not even get them past my ankle.
B00006CFCX|3|the collar and horns are very limp and I have to come up with a way to get them to stand up properly.  If I wanted to invest time in rebuilding them, I would have made it to begin with.  A bit disappointed.  Maybe they shouldn't cram the product into a plastic bag.
B008FWXEBM|4|I wore this sari to my friends wedding and everyone loved it. I will definitely but from this company again. I sent my measurements to them and they did stitch a blouse and petticoat for me.  They fit perfectly. The saree arrived a week before the estimated delivery date.
B005PR26NM|4|Nice T shirt, I ordered a little small unfortunately.  Great service
B00AGYMOJA|5|Love the feel of the jersey and got lots of complements when I wore this dress.  Wish it came in more colors.
B001R4C9CK|5|These big boys seamless toe athletic socks fit my women's size 10 foot very well.  They are soft and very cushiony.  I wasn't ever really bothered by seams but I was so impressed with the quality of the child's version of this sock that I wanted some too.
B00H28EKFO|5|This shipment was pretty fast and iloooooove the style of this its so cute! Im going on a date and this jacket is just perfect for it! I love it!
B00D3S8PB2|3|Length is nice and long, but waist is too wide.  I usually get size 9 so I guess i should have went with an 8. The product is nice!
B000DZF1YW|5|Used to create a white foundation for a joker costume but I didn't want to create an opaque white clown face. Using a sponge, I was able to build the right amount of opacity I wanted. Washed off cleanly with make up remover wipes and facial cleanser. Stayed on the entire night without flaking off.
B004BD14OS|5|I ordered this bolo for work --as a hostess at a western-esque restaurant, we have to have one-- and I was pretty happy to see it when it came it. It was bit bigger than I first thought it'd be, but that wasn't a real big issue. The artwork on the piece really caught my eye, I loved the small colored area at the bottom while the rest was silver and black; a very nice touch. The tie itself is heavier than my other bolo which is small and very light, but the extra weight isn't very noticeable after you've worn it for a few minutes.<br /><br />All in all, I really love this. It's beautiful, finely crafted, and it's gotten a few compliments at work too!
B0037J0TU2|3|It was not what I expected. Its height is maybe 2 inches like a girls belt. I expected 4 inches to where it would fit bigger in my belt loops. The colors dont look anything like they do in the picture. It seems like its made for kids.
B003AXZXEM|5|I purchased some elsewhere (because they were marked down), and loved the way they fit. They feel great, however, I'm not sure I could afford to purchase them at regular price!!
B00FRP2ZCY|5|My son loves this shirt he wears it all the time. All he wears is tractor shirts so this is one of his favorites!!!
B00AWTYD2U|5|Great sweatshirt!! Perfect!!!!
B00NCOYGJC|5|Every pair I order only makes me want to order another.I just love the curve hugging fit without the tightness.Keep more colors coming still looking for some reds.
B000ZKNIC2|4|My friend got one from Korea. He showed it to me and I love it.  Then I found it in Amazon.com. The price is reasonable compare to all the other iPhone cases. So I bought a black one. it's the slimmest hard case i can find for iPhone. The only thing bothers me a little bit is inside of the case is not painted. It's white! Even though you won't see it after you click it on your iPhone. Other then that, I love it. Highly recommended!
B00G0O1YD2|4|Pretty color, hangs nicely but very sheer.
B009N0CT5W|1|Just bad, very bad material. aarived with the wrong sizes. not recommend, nor the pants or the brand, seems cheap, does not have the size on the leggings.
B0085BACMC|5|Nothing to complaint about. the item as described, even better for me.  great material, great  look.<br />i would totally recommend this amazing jacket.
B000N8Q47M|4|Nice pants except they are not very &#34;relaxed&#34;. Ordered 34/32 since I wear 33/32 and it is hard to get anything in/out of the front pockets.
B00MHWU8OC|3|My son loves paw patrol. However when we got this shirt it was extremely small. We also bought one in a 3t and still had a hard time getting his head into that one. My son will be 2 this month so for the 3t to barely fit him wad disappointing. Thought they'd be cotton but they are made out of performance polyester.
B005FJ273O|4|Good, sturdy wallet that came in a nice tin case.  Has two bill locations and two ID locations.  It is a little larger than I am used to (LxW).
B00T33B4AK|5|I've heard of so many horror stories about dresses from china. But this was the total opposite! My dress was absolutely amazing and it looks exactly like the picture. It was very fitted and extremely long but with heals it looked completely fine. As for the seller was also very quick and responsive with feedback on each and every question I had. Honestly one of the best products I've bought off amazon... and it was a great value for money.
B00J3F24VQ|5|I ordered this skirt/ gave as a gift.my daughter loved it. This is not the only skirt I ordered from azules and they were all well worth it.my daughter loved it.would by again.material is very good.
B002P59J3W|4|I purchased the XL in both black and blue for a casual look with leggings.  I typically wear a M or L in women's and sized up as recommended by other reviewers.  The XL fits well, it is snug thru the shoulders, I wouldn't want it any smaller.  The body of the dress is roomy, I wouldn't want it any bigger.  Overall, it meets my expectations and I'm happy with my purchase.  I would buy more if they had a larger color selection.
B00OMAJK3C|2|You get what you pay for so I can't be completely disappointed but the stars on the gloves are not that neat and precise as on the picture.
B000NBGHDA|5|These are a great value as I bought them on sale, but even so, they are beautiful and colorful and look like the picture presented by the vendor.  They are well made and a nice addition to my husband's cuff link collection.
B004S9NDP8|5|It came in about four days-which I thought it would take two weeks due to the other comments I have read.<br /><br />I am using it for belly dancing and it is so full, light ( so you wont get too hot) , and gorgeous. the layers are wonderful!<br /><br />Although it is pricy- it is worth it!!! I got the yellow one! sooo pretty!!!<br /><br />And you could even wear it as part of a fancy outfit if you waned too!
B008MOQ2CG|4|works
B0002TNE1G|5|If you like this shirt, you should just buy it. Life's for your own to live your own way.
B00XOKG4BC|4|They are a little big but not by much she is almost six months and they're so cute and match a lot of outfits
B00001W0J3|1|I was very upset when receiving this costume!! It looked NOTHING like the picture!!!  No hood, short sleeved, very cheap.  Now I have to find something else for my 5 month old in 3 weeks and have the hassle of sending it back.
B004NRNR6A|5|Fit well, very comfortable.  Exactly what I wanted in a sock.
B00UW1NFKY|4|Very nice shirt
B00210VA7Y|4|These are very good quality. Not sure they look like the Beatles but very nice.
B007T4RTTK|1|Way too big! Be aware that the Small (6-18 months) does not fit the typical 6 month old. My daughter is 10 months old and this costume is huge! The return process was such a hassle that I decided to just keep it and try using it next year or something.  Would not recommend.
B002QWLT8M|4|This scarf was bought for all of the females in my family as a traditional\\" matching gift for the holidays. Everyone loved its soft feel, beautiful bright red color and fun tassles.
B00FPK0HGM|4|They fit well<br />But the material is stiff<br />I will see how they are after I wash them<br />They do look good
B009Y675MW|3|I liked this when it came out of the package.  I am a size 16/18 usually and very curvy and I ordered the XL.  It fit my body well after adjusting the corset laces in the back.  I didn't think my body was long, but this seems to fit a little on the short side.  Other than that, it looks sexy on and it comes with a string back, leather front matching thong which I didn't expect so that was a little bonus.
B00171LHJ4|4|I have to go a little larger in the circumference than I do with other brands.This was a lot of money to spend, only to find out that the bra is a bit snug, but i had already removed tags and washed the items, so I was not able to return them.
B00ACIGWJS|5|Love boxer briefs! They give me the closeness of the fabric and the coverage down the leg I want. Hanes is a very good and comfortable brand
B00A4E4JH2|5|I bought this garter set for my wedding day and I was VERY  pleased!!! Very beautiful and unique
B00KNV0NGM|5|Material is cheap-ish, but the fit is so good, it’s so flattering!
B001AQM5W4|5|It's an awsome cape it shwoshed and looked super cool when I walk and the hood is huge
B00CMVJADS|5|Very elegant. The fabric is perfect
B00JIUXKA0|5|This shirt fit as expected, shipped quickly and seemed to hold up when washed. I would recommend it to any Batman fan.
B002YDME78|3|I'm a size 10-12 and its To snug
B0031DSGJA|3|I purchased this coat in \\"deep blue\\" and was disappointed to receive a purple coat in the mail. The coat itself seems to be pretty decent quality and warm enough for a moderately cold day, though another thick layer will be neceessary for the majority of December-February. The arms are a good length for my sometimes difficult long arms. The color is my biggest disappointment. It's not bad, but it's nothing like what's pictured, and certainly is not blue. If you don't mind a purple coat, this is a nice one, especially for dressier occasions.
B00MXUHEH2|3|Is just a pant without the tutu.. 😐
B00B4X71NG|4|Size as expected and great colour. However a bit expensive for a Chinese shirt
B00NHFN4WG|4|Nice one for my wife but more suitable for the fall season
B00FJ1USY8|5|Great!
B000SQN9C2|3|Pros- easy to dry, well made  Cons- bite valve sometimes gets stuck, drainage hole can be difficult to close    An improvement over the designs of the 90's
B00JIS8692|5|Beautiful
B000VRC0PK|4|Straps were a little too long but other wise very comfortable thank you very much for the bra I l
B00CPQG39E|5|Our son loves it and get a lot of compliments .
B00I4Z508K|5|Such a fun and well fitting suit!! My little girl loves wearing it to swim school!! Very cute and colorful! THANKS!!
B0054MRA52|5|These run very small and yes you can buy your size stretch them and stretch them to get them on thinking all the while that by getting this stretch it will hold my fat in but no you are wearing the fabric beyond it's normal wear and you are ruining the garment and causing holes.<br /><br />It is best to size up one to two sizes on this product and unlike the other reviewer said, it will work great for slimming and giving a great wear.<br /><br />Handle this product with care in washing by hand washing. Do not dry in the dryer but hang to dry and you will have a garment that lasts and lasts.<br /><br />1. Size up one to two sizes<br /><br />2. Hand Wash<br /><br />3. Hang to Dry<br /><br />4. Put on with care no tugging. If you have to tug size up again.
B00AB1FYEA|5|Great material & good fit!
B00QB6UKFC|2|Much larger than anticipated. The many compartments are useful, especially the end pockets. Feels like I'm carrying a suitcase. Zippers are a little touchy.  I've used it so I can't return it, but it won't be my everyday bag as expected due to size.  It will probably work best for going to a parade or something - big enough to carry a bottle of water and a book while still going hands-free due to cross-body strap.
B005VWWJIS|5|Great quality and fast UK ship. Super cute!  The large would fit a tween or teen. My cat-lovin 10 y.o. daughter is going to luv this on Christmas morning. Excellent purchase!
B000H3XR78|2|I have worn wigs before, and they stayed on. This one fell off within a minute. It was deformed, flat on top and poofed out on sides. Looked horrible on. So I am returning it.
B00KRAV87W|5|LOVE this adorable, artsy dress...looks adorable with or without the satin ribbon.<br />I am so happy with the quality, colouring, and comfort of this dress. Excellent value...very boutique look. The lace cap sleeves are very soft & stretchy, and not scratchy at all.
B00ES8XPNY|1|very thin material that distorts the images when stretched and worn. These are very very poor quality. I would not order them again.
B00FZR19O4|3|Not really a fan of underwear, not meaning I don't wear them...just the idea of them. So here I am trying to write a review. They&#34;re just underwear, white cotton, non sexy, & practical. I wash before I wear and no visible shrinkage.
B00MF8KQCC|5|Great for colder weather.  Body is fleece and tights are warm.  Totally adorable.
B00B2H91UK|5|I love this dress. My daughter wears it all the time and receives compliments. It's flowy and pretty and very colorful. I ordered the size 7 (my daughter is a tall 6 year old) and it is pretty large and roomy on her, so I would say size down if you have that option. Love the dress, overall! Love Tea Collection!
B007YJ6XSI|5|This is a great Tee, black is always a good color and I am sure that this will be one of her favorites to wear to school.
B004M6UD46|5|Its nice wallet
B000HL1VH8|5|Love, love,  love this bra. I'm a 32H, but the 32G fits perfectly. I have both the black and beige.  It is true to size for the bandwidth. The bra acts as a minimizer for when I'm wearing tube tops or spaghetti strap clothing. I love the shape of how it fits. Very happy with this purchase.
B00KBZTO4W|3|They fitted just fine.
B00JLJI07Q|5|Loved that this was made especially for me
B00GAYEM5E|2|I am normally a size 10 - sometimes a size 12 depending on the make of the clothes -  but these jeans run SMALL!!!!  White jeans are so hard to find especially at a reasonable price -  I purchased the 12 -  they were wayyyy to tight -  had to go up to a 14!!!!!!!  Still a little tight but wearable!  Will not be putting these in the dryer.  Something tells me these are a knockoff and not really Levi's.  My advice -  go up 2 sizes if you decide to purchase these.  They are also low waist so that is another reason to go up in size otherwise if you are not super skinny you will have a muffin top. Other than that they are fine.
B0018T778U|4|The capri pants for men are exactly what I was looking for.  I had to return them to get a smaller size, but the seller made it an easy process.  I will certainly trust this seller for any future purchases.
B00JKTZX9A|5|Great fit, figure flattering, love it.
B00M2TR92E|1|The dress was too small and what was advertised is not what was actually sent. I ordered this for my cousin as a gift and I'm very disappointed. I ordered a large dress and the make is so small that it won't even fit her and she is not a plus size individual which is weird...
B00CEH3C0C|3|Rise is waaaay too short. I either have to pull them all the way and risk giving myself an atomic wedgie, or a let them sit low and feel the top of my a$$ rub against the seat of my pants. I wonder if, when they design these, they take measurements off of multiple &#34;big men&#34; and create a model based off of the averages...or if they just eye it up and say &#34;yeah, that'll cover 'em.&#34;
B00LGIT3P8|3|I absolutely loved this ring when I saw it. It took a little longer than I thought to ship, but considering it's from China, that's understandable. I love this ring but when I got it, two of the rhinestones were missing so I was pretty bummed about that. It's a very pretty ring though.
B001RMO3NK|5|I've used this money clip for years and love it. I am female and use this when travelling or when i don't want to carry a purse. I simply tuck it into my bra, where it is safe and secure.
B00ZZ63BZK|3|I love the shirt and it got here a lot sooner than expected. 2 weeks ahead of expected delivery. However the print is more faded than it is in the pictures so that's kind of disappointing. I would have preferred it looked more the picture.
B006PINXD2|4|The red blace combined style fit mother's style perfect. The whole looks so fashion and light as feather. The warm-keeping effect is so nice as what my mother said. It would be better if it coule be a little bit thicker. Anyway, nice stuff.
B00B8Y2SFC|5|Great quality! Perfect size! Great color choices! Very quick delivery-as promised-even with the holiday! Would buy from again!!
B00C1WZ98S|4|This is a cool shirt, it does run a little small tho. And It will shrink when you wash it.
B00422M6FE|5|Good quality and size
B007R8OXGA|3|the X-Large size does not fit properly.  I wear men's size 13 and the sock was much too big for my foot.  I had bought some Large size in a running shop a few months ago, and they are a little snug, so I was hoping these would fit much better.  Disappointed.
B00F1H3U22|5|Fit perfectly love it
B00369JX6O|5|Fits good, looks great
B000CDA442|4|Nice support, great style.  Love the zipper and contrast piping.  A bit low-cut for a sports bra.  If you have well-developed lat muscles, you may bulge out a bit between the outer side of your breast and your armpit.  Also, even on the shortest strap setting, the straps are a bit too long for my 5'3\\" frame.  Still a good deal.
B00SY4Q34Q|4|I love this! It is really cute but is too tight across the chest. I'm returning it for one size larger.
B00GRXTZY6|5|I love this nightgown - the fabric is lovely and the longer back is really flattering.
B00LP3D8EQ|1|The product was cheap and broken when it arrived. The stitching on the crown of the hat had come undone - only about 2/3 of the top was stitched on.  Some of the ribbon on the bow was stretched out.  Even if it had been perfectly put together I would have only paid about $15.00 if I had seen it in person. The ribbon and shape are pretty but the 'straw' of the main part of the hat is cheap like something from a souvenier or costume shop.  But the sillouette and color are nice.  And the hat is extremely lightweight.
B00KS79HPE|4|Pretty awesome! My son loves it. The buttons are plastic, not metal, and one cracked and fell off already. But, still, he loves it and has been wearing daily in the 90 degree heat! It is actually not that thick, almost like a light cotton wind breaker or heavy shirt, which is good for us here in CA. It won't keep you warm. ;-)
B003APQJC0|1|Wow! Do not buy! This tote finally arrived today and is poor quality at best. One handle seam is done completely wrong. The side seam on the tote wasn't even sewn. There were hairs on the inside of the bad. The top of the bag is sewn unevenly. Hmmm, I think that covers it. So, if you want to wait over a month for a poorly half-made bag, buy this. If you like quality or something that resembles the picture shown, go elsewhere. I'm extremely dissapointed and I'm not one to complain.
B0018ODQEE|3|The wallet appeared to be smaller than I expected. Its 10.5 cm X 8 cm. Has no coins compartment. But the leather is good and I like the color. Hope my BF will like it. I wanted this wallet for him as a gift.
B0051D7RYS|5|I love this style Lee pant, they are so comfortable and wear well. I must wear black pants daily for work and could not find these in my local store. I was thrilled when I saw them on Amazon.
B009TAZGPG|5|Knee socks are usually between $8 - $15 each pair, depending on where you get them from. I was thrilled to find this 6 pack for such a great price. The colors were as pictured and the quality is pretty good in my opinion.
B001H0F20U|2|This shirt is nice.<br />The bottom is a little bigger than expected, seems as if it runs a little large. Thats why the 2 star.<br />The material is nice.
B00MIM789E|5|I got this for my wife as a cover-up. She likes it a lot. It's a very pretty crochet pattern, and seems decently put together. The size fit true, which is always a plus. For husbands looking for a clothing gift for your wife, I got a big smile when she saw this. Lacy, crochety type things always seem to go over well. :-)<br /><br />For the practical ladies point of view, see Dianne Socci-Tetro's review.
B00AZ6VT22|2|armhole too large.  returned
B00CXXNIIS|4|My camera actually fits in the case. It has an elastic band inside so the camera does just drop out when you open it
B00OHYKYMY|5|If you want a perfect Michonne-style vest, this is definitely the best bang for your buck.
B00HANJMQ8|5|This jacket fits well, seems warm (we live at 7200') and is easy to get on and off. My daughter is 5 months old and weighs about 14lbs, this jacket has room to grow which I wanted. Hoping it will last a couple of more months!
B00IEKVFV6|5|Really wanted a jacket that fit in its pocket and was waterproof, but they don't seem to exist now. Love this jacket, but do wish it folded into its pocket!
B00CRLP8BQ|5|This suit fit great in all the right places. It is so cute, we got so many compliments. Great buy.
B009G4L41U|5|Love ot
B0049HQ0L8|1|It's not made that good. The knitting gets real loose so it's not that warm. I wouldn't buy these again.
B000WCSANA|5|My boy is in the 99% in height so it almost fit him right at his 1 year old bday.  If your child is 2 and average height then it will be good, at 3 it would be too small unless the child were short.<br /><br />We gave him his own special small cake he destroyed it... covering everything.  The great thing is that it velcros in the back and acted like a body bib.
B0036ZP43O|1|Why would anymore want to wear this? The person that make these t-shirts need to get a real job .
B004ADEZ9A|4|It fits well and didn't shrink in the dryer!
B00974BD2O|5|one of the best bras I've ever ever bought! i was super surprised when it fit PERFECTLY!! i will definitely buy again!!!
B00BV10QII|5|This jacket is wonderful! It is very stylish and keeps the water out! It fit a little bigger than expected but that may be to ensure that you can fit another shell-type jacket under it for super harsh climates. It has all the pockets and accessories that you would want/need. It seems to be very well constructed and comes with a heavy hood.
B00506Z7XE|1|The \\"leggings\\" that I purchased are not leggings, they are just stockings without feet. They are not even opaque. If you stretch the material, you can see skin through it. The seat of the \\"leggings\\" only have a breathable insert, just like a pair of hose, which would be visable if someone tried to wear these as pants. They are ridiculously tight, and not comfortable at all. I had even ordered 1 size larger than normal! As the final insult to oversized humans, they are shiny in texture like spandex. A matte finish would have been much more flattering to everyone. There is a reason that most large mammals do not have a shiny exterior. It makes their size more noticable, just as these \\"leggings\\" will on you! Don't buy them!
B00C391LAE|5|These Jockey men's microfiber boxer briefs are without question the most comfortable, best fitting underwear I've ever worn. The moisture wicking properties are impressive as well. I will definitely buy more of these.
B007BGV6QI|3|PROS: it got here on time, can be used as a dress with minor altercations.<br /><br />CONS: the print isn't as nice as the picture, the fabric is like sandpaper (even fabric softener wont help),
B00H8A0EL0|5|Beautiful color. Nice fabric. Great birthday present. Thanks, my love.
B000BWHJQU|5|Just what I had expected, it is lightweight and will dry quickly. The price made this a great buy compared to others I looked at.
B00IKCMPGM|5|Awesome
B004BZMIUU|5|This is my second purchase for their vests. Fit great, look great and very inexpensive. I believe they must be losing money to sell at this price.
B009A117N4|5|This is a great belt.  It is fully adjustable, and, if you need to shorten, you can do so easily.  The materials in both the belt and buckle are excellent.  As well, the workmanship is fantastic.
B006GBN7ZM|5|Covered entire game system. I would buy this one again. Easy to put on and line up with game system.
B00ILYUFOI|5|I'm a ladies US medium and it fits great. Perfect for summer, with a scarf, under a decorative cardigan, etc. Would definitely buy more colors from them.
B007W0XT36|5|I really like this shapewear, it is very comfortable
B001T9O55W|5|exelent
B00OBVKK4U|4|I haven't worn them for an extended period yet but they fit good-they are thin and tight, and it seems at first too tight, but they need to be snug to stay put and hidden in the shoe. They don't show, either. So far, so good!
B004KZQPOG|1|I was dissatisfied because at the time of washing were placed smaller and now I can't use it, tube to sell because i was not
B000OTTGJ8|5|I like the bra alot. It fits well. It goes well with a lot of my clothes. I like the material too. I would recommend it to anyone.
B001EILMC2|4|I think the dress was slightly big but the only option was a small when I'm an xsmall. It was cute and made of enough quality to be good for many Halloween's/parties. My favorite thing was the feather but it didn't stay in the headband well.
B00UWSF1EA|5|Good stuff
B00N2T6XFC|1|Too tight around the thighs and baggy around calves. awkward looking/feeling
B00FASTN50|5|Great fit, beautiful colors.
B00O4BK2Y0|5|Truly happy with these pants, nice quality, comfy and fit great.
B007WZMCLQ|5|Thank you  for being great  and on time
B005P25JGS|2|Fits tight,  hoping that it would of more comfortable  ...  and it material is not at all close to a smooth soft cotton.
B00H2SUHRO|2|Size was much too small, a bit misleading to be honest. I don't think I can wear it due to the smallness of the sleeves.
B00KSCQX4M|4|These underwear are very comfortable.
B00CHSZAWQ|5|very comfotable and fit nicely
B009VOVM44|5|love this shirt, want more of Daryl shirts and maybe some pajama sets too.  Cant wait for season 4 to start
B00DZI12MO|4|Great gloves, warm, touchscreen works!
B001CD1S6O|5|I purchased these for donation to a local hospital.  They were exactly as pictured, and packaged very well.  Great product and seller.
B001IYUVW4|4|I live in these visors!!!! I have a smallish noggin- wish the were a bit more narrow and feminine.
B0012M2OLI|5|I love this bra. It brought me down nearly two sizes and is incredibly comfortable. Makes a great tshirt bra and doesn't pull your boobs to the side real bad like a lot of minimizers I've found. So I give is an A++
B007B42W5E|5|love this shirt works very well with us owning a cairn terrier my wife wears this almost every weekend with pride
B00NRC65EI|5|Good quality as described and will deal with the seller again
B00A21VD4Y|4|My son loves this sweater. He wears it as a jacket. The sweater is larger than I expected, like a 16H size not regular width.
B000U3LT3E|5|Tough mil-spec pants, as described, good for outdoor work, hiking, hunting. Fast delivery. Sizing information is correct as listed. Definitely recommend this product if the camo pattern is appropriate for your needs.
B00VAO1LI0|5|Super comfortable and fits me very well. It's very forgiving in sizing I think as the are quite a few clasp ranges and adjustable straps. I might keep wearing this one even after I'm done nursing because of the comfortableness and the fact that it doesnt make me feel frumpy.
B000NAANS6|3|The jacket looked really great in the picture, but turned out to fit much tigher in the sleeves than expected, and since comfort is quite important to me, I returned it. I do love the styling, but the fit was too tight at the sleeve cuffs.
B004OOV9TE|5|happy customer!!
B0061ON5TW|5|Great fit well in my frames and they are polarized.
B006VOCFY8|5|Best costume ever!
B00J2WIPU4|5|It still won't fit in women's regular pockets.
B00FVGTJFK|5|Hola, buenas noches, tengo varias dudas con respecto al vestido: 1. Lo venden por tallas o lo hacen segun las medidas especificas de cada cliente? 2. En cuanto tiempo confeccionan el vestido? 3. Tienen color Ivory disponible para este modelo? 4. El vestido viene con armador o forro incluido? 5. Que tela es el vestido?<br /><br />Hello, good evening, I have several doubts about the dress. 1 Things I sold carvings or do according to the specific measurements of each customer? 2 But as time They make the dress? All 3 have Ivory Color available for this model? 4. The dress comes with owner or liner included?
B009QD1I80|4|Worth the price. It is soft and seems to be well made
B00GVG1NZS|4|It fits nice I do like it .
B00EZG9ARO|4|Looks a lot bigger on the picture and the slits on the side come up further then I would like, but I like it.
B001H0F6J2|1|The product was of Bad quality and very big for its size size, The product received had patches and threads coming out. Even though I am around 6 feet tall, Size M was long for me.<br />I had to pay for shipping to return the product. Would not recommend it
B00QSK6MEE|5|Really nice socks - cool look and I really like the comfortable fit.
B00D2ZZDM0|5|Good quality material will last a long time. Please let me know if you can get MC Escher printed shirts
B00BWO4DAQ|5|MY SON LOVES CHIMA AND HE REALLY LOVES THIS HOODY, FITS AS EXPECTED FOR A SIZE 4. GREAT ITEM FOR YOUR KIDS TO HAVE ESPECIALLY IF THEY FOLLOW THE SHOW.
B00JULZ7PI|5|Nice tee shirts! They fit well and are soft and confortable. Can't beat the price and I didn't have to leae the sofa!
B00IN8U48Y|1|Way way way too small. THe description should have listed it as Kpop slim cut. Had to give it away!
B00IUFZC78|5|It's so cute I just love it! ❤️
B002G9UEH2|5|Good quality product and comfortable.
B00UTVV6A8|5|Grandson loves this nice size!
B0043RI00I|5|LOVE IT! Especially the MockingJay, its beautiful! I bought a medium (I'm thirteen) and it fit me perfectly! I was afraid it might fit big but no! I absolutely LOVE IT! <---True Hunger Games fan xD <3
B00LGOIS1M|5|I ordered a size larger than I actually wear because I read other reviews saying they run small. I like the fit and have received many compliments and due to the extra space around the shoulders and arms I can wear sweaters without issue. Very tailored and sophisticated look.
B0086VNR82|5|made well and love how it moves when dancing, and the time I got it in was great turnaround, would buy from them again
B0007YXS3U|4|This bra is a super, well-fitting product for me.  Being a bit larger on one side than the other (no one is perfect...right?), this bra is a real find because of the cups.  They seem to cover a multitude of sins, plus this bra is actually sexy for a woman who is large breasted.  We usually get stuck with the \\"plain Jane\\" type of bra that makes us feel less attractive.  Since I found it, I've ordered every color and I will be sure to keep several in reserve.  I rated this bra as a four star only because the lace is a bit rough in the beginning, but once washed several times it gets softer.  Don't hesitate to try this bra.....I think you'll like it!!
B003GXFTIG|4|The belt is very good looking and fashionable. Only thing I didn't like about it was it is kind of noisy. The leather tends to squeak. Hopefully this will go away after wearing it for a few days. Fits fine. Good product.
B00JQBB1SE|5|Our newborn wore the hat while in the hospital, and we've used the short sleeve outfit and the swaddling cloth since being home. All of them are very soft, easy to clean, and look nice on our baby. Good value for the price.
B0002TOTA6|5|Fine product and I ordered the size designated for my shoe size.  However, I have a narrow foot and that made the hose too long.  I unsuccessfully tried to shrink one pair in hot water and then a hot dryer.  Returned the other pairs for credit & ordered a single standard size to see if that will work.  Although the credit has not been received or the standard size the interaction in arranging for the return could not be more positive!  Hence, 5 stars
B00Y45FNOK|1|Side seams flare out at breast & look like wings. Hem uneven & too short to wear as a dress if  you are 5'8&#34;&#34;
B00JGEGY6K|4|Sleeves a little to long
B0084HYL9W|5|great beanie, shipped quick.
B003RAAA2I|1|This flogger is cheaply made in India.  My wife and I were just testing it out and the metal studs started to fall off - Don't waste your money
B00SHH8THE|4|I read many reviews that this dress was smaller than expected so I bought a larger size. It looked big when it arrived, but once I put it on it felt fine. I normally buy size small, and I went with a large because I just had a baby and bought it for easy nursing access. I will say it's perfect for nursing in, no problem. Super stretchy! The blue is a pretty color too
B00KJJOAYO|3|They are sweat pants with a boot cut, but im 5'9 and it was a little too short length wise for me.
B0002TOXL6|1|These socks are not fluffy. I'm use to fluffy socks like the Burlington Interwoven Mens Socks which are really fluffy. For being the smallest size, they are too large for anyone that wears a size 9 shoe.
B00QJRJE0A|4|Happy with this coat. Very warm in zero weather.
B001D06SKC|2|The fabric is kind of stiff and it doesn't do much for the body.
B00PWTGY18|5|Bought it for my daughter....she loves it! Fast shipping too!
B00CBAOMVU|5|My son-in-law loved them and told me that they fit perfect.  This should help him stay nice and warm when he has to work outside.  Fast shipping, packed perfect, great value.  Thanks!
B007ND68OE|5|Keeps me warm in the winter weather,,looks & fits good,,it has 2 pockets inside with an extra pocket for a mp3 player,,i would buy this again
B00H8BCNAO|3|Son wears size 12-12.5 and the socks are huge on him.  Guess he'll grow into them but he doesn't like wearing them now becuase the heel is so high.
B004A7XXXA|4|I wish the waistband was a bit more soft and comfortable , but they fit as expected and don't ride up!
B00ZAO7FCM|5|great
B002X4YVO2|5|I had bee looking for a dressy leather coat for sometime when I saw this one for sale and the write up was positive.  I have enjoyed wearing the coat and have received compliments on it. It can be worn for dress up or casual.
B0052HRLKI|3|Good jeans but too big for my slim little man.  We even measured before ordering.  No buttons to adjust the waist either.
B00UZAE4BG|2|This item is clearly not made for an adult.  I am 5'3 and 112 lbs and there is no way this would have fit over my hips. I gave it to my friends 9 yr old and it fits her snug.  Not worth the cost of shipping to return the item
B005GPLHTM|4|sharp clothes for fat girls!
B0088V5RQU|5|These socks are comfortable, durable, and built to last.  I use these with a thin liner sock...a combination that keeps my feet blister-free whether hiking in winter or summer.  My feet sweat easily no matter what socks I'm wearing, but the Lite Hiker Sock minimizes the sweating compared to thicker, heavier socks I've tried.  These socks are pricey, but they last forever and you will get your money's worth in the long run.
B003DKR5DY|5|Looks great.
B00EJRQWC0|5|OK, most of the younger viewers don't know who the Clash were much less this great album. I always loved this cover- I thought it was iconic of the Sex Pistols/Clash revival of rock in the eighties. Smashing their guitars (which they could barely play but hey Pete Townshend reportedly in a stupor met the clash and profusely apologized for selling out rock and roll). It's cool- what else can I say.
B00APBU3QU|2|Bought it for the wife. It fits but it has this slippery cheap plastic feel to it. It looks much better in picture.
B0036B0TO2|5|Good
B0055GFVV2|3|Overall great purchase although picture of pin size can be misleading.
B00C7BOTES|4|I bought this item for my teenage daughter. She really liked it and said it was soft and comfortable. It was a bit big as far as fit go.
B0006U054K|5|These are nice cotton blend briefs that fit well, and wash well, without shrinking, I love Bali products for fit & comfort.
B008RV69JU|4|Ok. So I read the reviews that it ran small and I measured myself before ordering up a size. The fit is super adorable and very flattering as I love neutrals- but I'm so pale it always looks funny if I wear lighter colors closer to my face. The fabric is not silk but has that rayon/silk wannabe feel. The cut in the shoulder is a little narrow so may not work for girls with wider shoulder but so many compliments :)
B00K6ZO5HS|5|I just love it.
B00JE1XS1Y|5|Great fit and it was nice and long and light for this hot summer. Easy to layer and color was exactly shown. Will purchase again
B00M0DGSSI|3|When  I purchased this shirt I didn't realize it was a XL &#34;slim fit&#34;... when I put it on I thought I bought the wrong size.  Fit very tight.+
B0120UACGE|4|more stretchy than cotton , but still super cute! Buy a size larger.
B001T7K9Z4|5|I loved it!
B00AKSCROE|5|excelente
B00L9Y8DAU|1|They don't stay up.  What is the point of a compression stocking if they fall every five minutes.  They are more annoying then helpful.
B003HC8S0C|5|Purchased three pairs for my wife. She liked them so much, I ordered three more pairs. Amazon will my source for future purchases.
B00JW0CWSC|5|Big bubble guppies fans here.  My little guppy loves his bubble puppy pjs.  They are comfy and of good quality
B00QA886RA|5|Very nice sweater
B00NIGX28U|5|They fit well.
B003XCGZW4|5|Great length and shape! It can be dressed up or dressed down. I'm 5'5&#34; and about 125 lbs and I got a small and it fits really well, also I think it has a good amount of give so you won't be disappointed with the size.
B002T04QKE|5|You know there socks. I think that socks are taken for granted in this ultra fast society of ours. But you know, if my feet don't feel well, then I am miserable. I like these particular socks for Spin and Step Aerobics.
B008MMBI5E|4|I am pleasantly surprised with this belt.  For something so inexpensive I was afraid it was going to look and fit badly.  I was wrong.  It is a good fit and looks very nice with the black maxi I bought it for.  I have only worn it once so am hoping that it will hold up with more wearing's.  Time will tell but for now I'm pleased with it.
B000LNG42E|4|\\"This outfit is perfect and it came as a dress, shirt attached to the poodle skirt with a belt and a scarf! I have recently put on weight and currently am a size 14-16...The XL was a great fit. I only gave it 4 stars because the belt would not stay tightened even though it looked fabulous with the dress...Otherwise, it's a 5! Just be sure that you are ordering the dress and not just the skirt.\\"
B00JXMEVP6|4|Seems a bit roomy but I have not washed and dried it yet. Very nice plaid size. It is cute for any gender or age. Nice pajamas!
B00CM7JTSS|5|High quality, plenty of<br />Room to grow!
B00ENLD6JO|5|I love these shirts. I was tired of my cotton T-shirts shrinking and curling up at the bottom when they came out of the dryer. I had a NFL T-shirt that fit well, never shrunk, and always came out of the dryer perfect and no need for ironing. I noticed it was polyester so I searched Amazon for 100% polyester shirts. Found these and ordered one. Fits great, feels good, and washes and dries perfect so that I just need to hang it up after drying. I immediately ordered four more. The price is excellent for these shirts.
B00OQ3CHJ4|5|100% satisfied
B000A0FPOG|5|This product is great the store that sent it was really fast on delivery I would recommend them!
B0032GS934|5|Very nice fit and look
B0094REXBM|5|I bought this for my five year old daughter. She loved it so much, in particular, the design and color combinations.
B00K79UMRK|5|The coat fits me perfectly<br />I just know my size
B00H2NZHDS|5|Sweatshirt is great
B009GFJ1JG|5|Great fit and shape! Quality is amazing.
B00JEF3DAG|5|Great item, fast shipping thank you
B00CAA0KNK|3|It fit nicely. I'm a size 8 and ordered a medium. I made some adjustments and spray painted some moss paint for fun.
B004K07ZKE|5|these panties are one of my favorites....they fit great and are super sexy yet comfortable  A++
B0049AWVH2|5|I got these because another review said they stayed on better than regular socks and THEY DO! My son is a very kicky baby and they stay on all day, but they're not so tight that they leave a sock ring. Right now my son is 6 months old and they still fit, but they are getting smaller. The design hasn't faded or changed at all since the day we got them. They haven't warped at all with washing. I love these socks and would recommend them to everyone!
B00KBX3BX4|5|Fit my 10 year old perfect!
B0029RD8LA|5|Great mask at a great price.
B005LAFTAK|4|Great set of comfy pajamas...I was super happy when I got them, as the pants were nice and long.  Now that I have washed them, they are much shorter...probably shrank up at least 3 inches.  Still very comfy though.  Good buy.
B00BBGO01M|5|she loved it ;)
B001UT272O|4|Make sure to check the size before you order these socks. Shoe size and sock size are not the same!    Also, these are white and not \\"natural\\" color like the single-pair socks you can also get from Maggies Organics. They don't seem to offer a \\"value pack\\" of the \\"natural\\" color socks. Too bad!
B00BA1WWQI|5|I purchased this wrap to wear after swimming at the gym, Unfortunately it was just a bit too small - I wear an XL or a 1X in ready to wear.<br />I will be returning it for the extra-large size...although the XXL size comes only in white.<br />This item is particularly high-quality; thick, absorbent and soft. It will last a very long time.
B0081F1EOW|5|Great qulity
B00220ZRI6|5|Awesome design and the quality is fantastic.  I would highly recommend this product. I have bought several designs over the past few months.
B00LYI5BLU|5|good regular fit cut
B000HD73LY|4|Looks nice, and fits fine, but the quality is not that great.  Do not regret the purchase, but would not by the same one again.
B006SRTFXW|5|good quality, excellent fit, good warmth, soft material doesn't fit too tight so you still have movement, nice wide wasteband
B00H8ANJLC|5|Calvin Kline boxers are really nice light weight, not too long, right size, and comfortable.<br />Also, my favorite is; there is no stiitched seams on the butt area, so it doesn't go between your checks...
B00NKX7ULQ|1|I normally do not give bad reviews, but this is awful. I knew it wouldn't be great becasue it costs basically nothing, but it wasn't even sewn together on some parts, luckily I can fix it myself, but the quality of the whole item is so awful, just an all around waste of time and money. Oh well, what can ya do?
B008RJKU06|5|I saw it and couldn't resist to buy it. My boy loved the pj's. they're a bit big BUT will fit perfect once winter comes a long
B00E0GYXPS|5|Both of my son's love it they wear it most of the time sometimes it hard to get them off of them lol
B00N0S17WO|5|I bought these for my daughter. When I asked how she liked them she said, ''They're great. Thanks, Mom.'' :-)
B000PVR570|5|I ordered the wrong size but the hate color I chose was sooooo nice (stone I think?) I really love how the color looks, and I love bucket hats.  The material is nice and comfortable.
B00DP45MP6|5|Love it!
B00Q3J7QKE|3|ok
B00I5UUBXS|4|Good
B002AU241Q|5|Great to have a difficult to find size.  Good fit and quality finish.
B0068PD8H8|4|Fits pretty well, good material
B002DWTJNC|5|loved this while it lasted - the zipper keeps my portable usb drive safe and the Velcro kept it closed it was the hole in the leather that held the triangular attachment that frayed too soon.  Maybe if there were some metal grommet or something to make the leather sturdier it would have lasted longer as something I put on a lanyard.  Now I keep it in my pocket separately from my office keys. I still use it though...just not as convenient as it was before.
B002RCXY0W|3|MISSING AN ITEM
B00KROXH18|3|Fit is a little small. 13 YO likes the graphics and he gets compliments on how cool it is. The underlying shirt is a little cheesy in quality - thin fabric, not particularly well-sewn.
B00DS43VII|3|The legs were a bit baggy & long, but fit well around the waist.  I need to wear heels with them or roll the bottoms up.  Very comfy though and good quality material.
B0058GM9P0|5|Love them
B0089NO966|3|I currently wear the Victorias Secret Very Sexy bra in a 34DD, it fits me well and gives me great cleavage, however $60 for a bra is over priced in my opinion, i own 4 of them and did not want to spend that much on another. so i began looking for a similar bra at a better price and thats when i ran across this. It is WAY to small!! i think i would have to go up a band size or 2, and maybe a cup size or 2. if it fit right i think it would be a great bra. its basically a lightly lined bra with removable push up pads at the bottom. i will be returning this one and contact someone from Fredericks to see what to do about the sizing. If you have a Fredericks store close to you i would reccommend going there and trying them on. the closest one to me is 2 hours away :/
B00JM2FJXU|5|Fits perfects, looks nice, and the material feels great.
B0072LBW3Y|5|Ignore the negative reviews. I was so scared to buy this product, because of those who said it's too tight, only an 11 year old can fit into it. Well I'm skinny. I weigh 120 pounds and I'm 5'3 when I tried this on I was amazed. The fabric is high quality. I was expecting cheaper fabric for the price and it is so stretchy. I bought this shirt in dark blue, yellow, white, pink, purple, light blue and black. All of the colors are gorgeous. You get more than what you paid for. I am going to buy the rest of the colors. I also had my mom try the clothes. She is has a big stomach. It looked great for her upper body, but did show her stomach. This was easily fixed with a girdle. If you are plus sized and have a big stomach you may not want to buy this product unless you have a girdle. For thinner people it is very flattering, comfy and stretchy. I pretty much bought a whole new wardrobe and will definitely buy more. If this review still didn't change your mind try buying one. The shirts come folded and in a nice plastic bag. I don't even want to hang the shirts up yet. I just want to put the shirts in my closet the way they are, because they just look perfect and neat.  The only problem is that I had to watch out for my nails, because it can mess up the fabric. My nails got hooked on the shirt and pulled the string of the fabric. Luckily my shirt wasn't damaged, but still be careful.
B001B679HO|5|This was the first time I'd ever worn anything role-playing so I wasn't too sure about it when I ordered it. It looked much better on me than I thought it would and the quality of the material is much better than I thought it would be. My boyfriend loved it sooooo much.
B00075ZWY2|3|med was alil big
B006ODTJMW|4|I have very wide calves, so I wasn't expecting these to go all the way up. However, they go almost all the way to my knee they fit great and are comfortable to wear. I love them.
B00NSO4AK6|5|Extremely pleased with the skirt it's beautiful I'm very very impressed you have a loyal customer thank you
B000ORSOZ2|5|I am going to order more they are that comfortable. They don't cut off circulation like some . At the end of the day my ankles are not swollen.
B00OABC1NE|5|Ordered hoping the the reviews were true about it running large. The dress is beautiful and made exactly as shown. I'm a 2x in forever 21 dresses and probably could have gotten a medium in this one
B000VK3TX4|3|I had such high hopes.  I have a couple of Glamorise bras, and they're pretty decent; the cups seem to run a bit small, but 40G in Wacoal runs a bit large, so I deal.  This, however...  The band and shoulder straps were great; I would have dealt with the underbust band rolling up a bit, if the cups had only been big enough.  (And I don't mind the retro-pointy that much, depending on the direction of the point, but I digress.)  These cups felt like a D; they were not large enough to accommodate the mass of my breasts, and squashed them not just flat, but into my armpits to spill over the top of the sides.  No matter how much I leaned forward and smoothed the breast tissue to the front, the cup smashed half of it back out as soon as I stood up.  Front-smoosh didn't really happen due to the bra's structure, which was great... but I cannot live with armpit-muffins.<br /><br />So, larger gals, I recommend a cup size or two up... if you can get it.  I'd love this in a 40I or 40J, but Glamorise stops at G.  *sigh*  Guess I'd better go submit my Return Authorization request.
B00VRDJRLW|5|Fit great. I ordered my usual size (med) and it fits like on the model. Fitted but not super loose or baggy.
B00U27ONQ8|5|Absolutely love this suit. Made from high quality materials,  and adjustable straps. Very cute
B001EPJC9U|5|I had to have a hat for a convention, it needed to be packable but still stylish.  This did both.  I could embellish it with floral pins etc. to have it match my outfits etc. so it was very versatile.  I think it's a very practical hat for travel.
B000J41P3S|4|I bought these for work. They are of good quality and fit perfectly! I have 4 stars instead of 5 only because when I wanted them they became extremely wrinkled. I am not a big fan of having to iron and there was no way around it. They Had to be ironed!  I will try the wrinkly free setting on the dryer next time, hopefully that will help.
B001RFI356|5|Good service it came fast and on time . I liked the belt and the cost was good to. I will buy there again.  I got what thay said I would.
B001SN4KQS|3|Don't think the material would last long but did fine for my party.
B001IVY2I6|1|These were to be gifts for co-workers. At $20 each (for one pair), I was hoping they would look nicer than they do. They seem like much less expensive $5 gifts...and imo scream cheap!<br />Also, the packaging is such that you can't take the price off of it without defacing the product packaging. And to make matters worse, the price on them says $14.97 when I paid $20.00 each. Since I bought 13 of them, I paid $65 MORE than what they are priced at. ZOIKS! Definitely not feeling good about this pricey purchase...
B005POLLRW|1|This item was fit for a 7 year old.  I bought a size large long and this shirt was a extra small and definetley not long.  I will never order from this company again.
B000TA0NAI|5|nice fit nice material make my booty look so cute lol got here fast too thank you
B00B58HYEQ|5|Good inexpensive pants.
B003U2SZBG|5|This sweater/shirt is just perfect for wearing with a dress. I got black/grey and it's very versatile. I have very skinny arms and sometimes have trouble with sweaters where the arms are just too big (circumference-wise) but this sweater is very forgiving.
B00HLS292G|2|I purchased this and it arrived on time. Was smaller than I expected and did not fit the way I expected it would.
B005C9FTVO|3|I don't like how it closes in the back because it doesn't match the photo. It in photo it flatters as bottom to show her curves but in reality it just doesn't sit that way and it looks a little odd......
B0088FT3G6|5|Wallet is great, the the money clip needs to be watched carefully as it sticks above the wallet and it may tear your pockets
B0024L93R4|4|Ordered a large due to the concern that small/med was too small. Is a little Large however very warm and will probably shrink with washing. Robe is very heavy and very warm, not the soft lifeless ones you usually see.
B003ZKP9L2|5|Got this for my son and his daughter loved it so much she won't stop wearing it so I will be buying another one. Thank you so much.
B00TQ7WWVI|4|I ordered a 4t knowing it would be small but it fits my almost 3 year old well. It has room for him to grow and wear this summer. If he was already 4 it would be too small. He isn't a big child, just average. 30 lbs and 3 feet tall.
B00FRKKBAW|5|Purchased for my son for Christmas - he said it was excellent and the quality was impeccable. Promptly delivered in the UK. Size perfect as per standard sizes
B0091TS4TK|3|Your head has to be ginormous to fit into this hat. Should be described better. Looks like a witches hat.
B00A7L8ZKE|5|Various sizes and heavy duty metal keep collar edges down and in place all day!
B00SYPIHBC|5|Beautiful hat, especially the price
B00A3HG5J0|5|Its quality is good
B002APXHIA|4|Nice fit,  look good, after wash did need to iron, I've bought another pair.
B00NXWTCNI|3|I bought the small size but think it was more like a Medium or large size. I do not know the word in English, and amazon did not let me post in Spanish, but the distance from the crotch area to the belly button is larger than what I would have expected from he picture....i would not buy this model again, although i will still use it.
B00FDND8OO|5|It is same as on the picture, fit perfect and look perfect! Highly recommended!I love it!
B008VO5VUG|5|I bought this coat for something that wasn't too heavy or too light. I always get compliments on it. Cute style, the asymetrical zipper is a nice touch. Nice size pockets on the outside of the coat and there are two pockets on the inside of the coat one pocket up top and one pocket on the lower part of the coat. Like the little faux fur trim on the collar & hood. I purchased a medium fits true to size body wise and on the sleeves (I'm 5'4, 145 lbs). I live in Vegas so it's good for the cooler months here in the winter (Yes, it does get cold in the desert). Orginally from NY, I know NY cold so if it's 20 degrees and it's bone chilling cold, this will not work you would need down. But, when the winter weather in NY is mild and you are layering your good. The hood is not detachable it would have been nice to have the option but it's roomy for a hat, scarf. Overall very cute, great price & happy.
B00DUUZB1U|3|very small
B002B9IACS|4|My wife was happy to find these @ amazon, because apparently they are hard to find in stores.  She would give them 5 stars if the size was a bit more generous--she takes a size 8.5 shoe--but she says they are better after a washing & not putting in the dryer.
B00URQXJTG|5|Love it ,so comfy
B00ODWOV6U|4|Slinky fabric, fits well. I'm between a size 2 and 4 and I think the pattern hits me in all the wrong places. It makes me look much larger than I am. Otherwise it fits well. I do get compliments on it.
B000X77VTS|5|I bought this shirt for my husband's birthday two years ago, and he STILL loves it.<br />He loves the design and the material -- he's pretty picky about fabric (well, about a lot . . . but fabric is one thing in particular), so he only wears 100% cotton tee shirts.<br />It's starting to fade a little with the frequent washings, but he won't stop wearing it. I guess I'll have to buy another! :]
B00BQMZH7W|5|I love this sweater. Perfect weight for down here.
B0018OZGJC|2|Fit was perfect, He was looking for a particular fabric and this was not it.  He had purchased a Savane pant in the past that was wonderfully wrinkle free and I guess Savane no longer makes it.
B008ESDBWO|1|ordered small size, but given me a XXL !!!!
B00311TZAQ|3|This claw is really cool and looks good as a decoration. If you want to wear it for cosplay, don't buy this one. The handle it too long and will show outside your fist. There are others out there that hide the grip.
B00FFXU9Y4|3|I like these pants but I wouldn't buy another pair.  The zipper is extremely hard to close and they come up pretty high on your waist.
B00FARCNWQ|4|Wish it was a little longer but will be ordering more. I'm pregnant and it's perfect for belly support.
B00E3MNA1W|5|the jacket fit somewhat loose, but he is smaller than other boys his age! Compared to overly priced high end coats, it's well worth the price. Plus he liked it, specially the removable vest!
B00EYXZ4WS|1|It sucked
B003VPQC2Q|3|These need more rubber on the soles. My kid still slips and falls on our wood floors. Other than that they're good quality. For size comparison, his shoe size is 8 extra wide and I ordered the socks in the 2-3t. Fit was perfect.
B00VNNLOO4|5|This was purchased for my grand daughter who is 11, and the fit of women's small was perfect.
B006PK92YO|4|Not bad, probably order a few more! IF THEY PROVE TO BE WELL MADE TO LAST! Only time will tell us.
B004IE0E4G|2|I'm 5'10 ,165 lb, The M is  somewhat large, and the polo is out of style too
B00A14G1G2|3|I purchased the dress by following the sizing info provided by the seller, but the dress was smaller than expected. Another dress of the same size of a different brand was a perfect fit.
B00JF0GT88|5|I got this for my husband for Christmas. It is a very nice shirt and good fit for an athletic body as shown in the picture. My husband looked great in it, it washed well. But alas he won't wear it because it is so bright, which it the reason I bought it. Great rich shade of orange
B009182R2Q|3|not very flattering
B00HDA2WIS|4|The Gerber Baby- Boys Newborn Cap was my favorite hat that I received on my registry.  My baby's head was quite large (97th percentile) and it fit fine at birth.  At 3 weeks I was no longer able to fit the hat on his head.  It is adorable on, and I enjoyed it while it lasted.
B00QB345CY|4|Good product
B0076PVASI|5|My son loves it!!  He has had many compliments!!!!  It is even cuter than pictured.  I am quite pleased with this purchase.
B006YEUIGC|5|Bought for my 17 ur. old son. He loves them. It makes a good fashion statement.
B0044QEBGA|5|excelente producto
B008AHWB5C|3|Great concept - gorgeous color, interesting details,dramatic neck, short, so it would go well with high waisted skirts, pants, but it has one major and one minor flaw. Minor flaw is that the waist is a bit baggy so could look a little boxy. The real problem is that for some reason they put POCKETS on this! With such a short sweater, the only spot possible for pockets is right at the chest - not good. If they bag out at all, like when bending over  to one side for example, it looks like I'm carrying my boobs in my pockets!. A larger busted girl would want to stay away from this. Unfortunate and not very well thought out - the pockets are so shallow that they're useless anyway and really they just ruin an otherwise beautiful sweater. It is such a great color, though and I love the frog clasps, so I'm debating keeping it. Glad I got it on sale but for that price it still ought to be perfect. BTW I'm 5'6&#34; 123lbs, 34C and ordered a S. Fit is fine.
B0013XWDEO|3|Not my favorite sports bra but it does the job
B00M7C9ZJQ|3|I bought a size large and I'm a size 8. It was smaller than I expected it to be. I usually buy the large because I don't have a flat tummy and I like the support but I want it to be comfortable. Other than that it's fine.
B007GCK85M|5|These scrub pants are great! I ordered a size larger than normal based on other reviews and these fit perfectly. I will be ordering more!
B00HDE6RJY|4|Even though I had to return this item because it was too small.  It was very well made, and I loved it.  Wish it had fit.  It does not run large enough for me though.  Good Luck.
B00CVQ16WM|4|I do like this shirt would have expected it to be alittle lose but I would buy this product again.
B005FHKLBQ|5|Love It
B0087TFPBU|3|I was so excited when I opened the package! The material is so soft and the quality of Joe's jeans are awesome! I only wish I ordered one size smaller than my regular size, so sad I had to return it because they were too lose. I will order them again for a smaller size.
B00EKQ9UME|5|I really love it!
B004UULUYQ|5|Cute.
B000934UL8|5|After wearing Saucony's and recently Asics for running, I think I've gone to Mizuno without looking back. I'll buy the other brands for just walking around in or for everyday wear, but the Mizuno is what I need for running. <br /> <br />I'm a fairly good size (i.e. heavy) with a pretty big arch. When my feet hit the ground while walking or running, they roll from outside in. Called underpronation, this calls for shoes with more cushioning than most people require. When I put this shoe on, it fit my foot well, which is very unusual (I wear anywhere from size 8.5 up to 10.5 depending on the shoe brand, and my foot is wide and rather short -- about a true size 8.75). I've taken these out for a long walk and light run, and they performed well. Break in time in running shoes now adays is measured in minutes or hours, rather than days. This shoe is no exception. <br /> <br />Keep in mind that this shoe is very light and the material on the upper is geared for the lightweight rather than durability. You will likely wear this shoe out sooner, and I wouldn't recommend it for everyday use like I would other Asics or Sauconys (especially the trail lines of both). This brings up the only thing I don't like about the shoe -- the front part of the strings (nearest the toe) hit my foot on the where the foot ends and the toe begins (if that makes any sense). If the strings are tightened, I feel it more than I have in most other shoes. In other words, there isn't a lot of interior cushioning for the top part of the foot. This bothers my left foot more than my right, so it may not be an issue for too many wearing this shoe. Just FYI. <br /> <br />Mizuno is the best all around sporting goods manufacturer of all time. I can't think of one product they make that isn't excellent. I play their golf clubs (irons), their baseball glove was the best I ever owned, and now their shoes are top rate.
B00N3N6CZS|5|I've tried several body shapers and they're either too restricting or don't work at all. I was pleasantly surprised that this holds everything in and smooth without being too tight, especially for the great price. It's very comfortable to wear and the look is very nice. I'm 5'2 and wear a size 14/16, I ordered an XL (XXL on the factory tag) and it fits very well.
B004IA7092|5|Adorable and well made!
B007JFEQAO|3|I'm 5' 9&#34; and the XL is too long for me, and I have a long torso for my height. It's still a sweet-ass Def Leppard shirt though
B002F1UBS8|1|The costume they sent was used, get dirty and stained! or after washing the stains were removed!<br />Would not recommend ...
B00IAV4M6O|5|Perfect to layer underneath your summer tubetop as a substitute for uncomfortable strapless bras.  I am a 34F, so was suspect about the One Size Fits All, but they fit fine.  These are unlined, basically just a band of pantyhose similar to Spanx.  I layer two of them to provide a little more coverage for headlights under the more loose cotton tubetops I'm wearing w/ maxi skirts, not the super tight ones.  Whether it's one or two, they hold up the girls just fine, obviously not as much push-up as a strapless bra, but the comfort is worth giving up a little lift.<br /><br />I've washed them a couple of times w/ a regular laundry load, and I've gotten the occasional string pull but only at the seam which is easy to snip off.
B004T9XFCI|3|A little more shrinkage than I expected when I washed them. But they still fit. I generally wear a small to medium depending on the item. Even with shrinkage they still fit because I ordered a medium
B009FV8BJW|3|CUTE FOR THE WINTER...:)
B00O1G49P6|3|It's as the picture BUT the sleeves are a little short.
B003CLZ3TM|5|Loved the hat desighn sick kinda tight on my head though but still love it<br /><br />MCL!
B00DR1XLH8|4|thin material. If you are looking for something has lift effect, this is not the right short for you. I wear normal size xs or s for shorts usually. I ordered a medium and a large one. The medium one fits pefect. The large one fits a little bit loose but not a lot so I keep it too.
B000ULSETS|5|Just wonderful. My friend adores it! And I do , too. Very very fast shipping also and in perfect order.
B00171R6QM|5|This is exactly what I needed for a recent costume. I was very impressed the quality for the price. Rubies' products are top notch!
B008727Q6O|3|Looks very nice in person. Nice large sequins and they are layered nicely. The garment runs large. Purchased for someone who wears a 32B and it's way too big. This had to be altered.
B00MV0SDTM|5|I Cant Count the Complements I Have Gotten Already on This Hat! & Who Doesnt Love Complements?! I First Found This Hat In A Boutique for $33! & instantly Was In LOVE! But Couldnt Bring Myself to Pay That Much Before Checking AMAZON- $9.99 & Free 2Day Shipping Cant beat it! I lose Hats and Glasses Like CRAZY! Everything is Beautiful, the Leather Tag is My Favorite Because it Complements The Color and Sets It Apart From Others, Beautiful color and Everything I Expected.  Love it! May need Many Other colors. Arrived in two days As it Was supposed to & Its Since Been Keeping Me Warm AND CUTE In The COLD OHIO WINTER! I Included Photos and One is To Show The Negative Reviews about No slouching Like its Supposed to Is Absolutely Wrong. Its All About Sittingit on Your Head as Its Supposed to Be. 100% Best Purchase Ive Made in A While. You Wont regret It!<br />Thank you.
B00DYVHCO4|5|I have purchased four pairs, of these now. All are well ventilated,  and serve their purpose.
B00AAHA81Y|4|Took it to London this summer, and I definitely have no complaints.  Keeps me dry.  Its a touch big, but that's room enough for a sweater.
B00DO3YN76|5|Love them!
B001TD4774|5|Inexpensive way to help my nephew (3 yrs.) use his imagination and become a knight.
B005I33PTM|2|These are cheaply made and not up to the usual Carhart quality.
B000MN8CWI|5|Good!
B00A7QUD72|5|Nice under shirts. Sleeve length is perfect to hide under short sleves. Vneck is just right for hiding below button shirts. Lightweight, which is nice for hot weather.
B00HH5G7KS|5|it's gorgeous! perfect for the spring and summer coming up :)
B00DGEK1SI|5|I got this blouse to where with a classic lolita skirt and it looks awesome c: The blouse itself is really comfortable and kinda stretchy which was a pleasant surprise. Sizing is accurate and it fits great. A++ for me :D
B00MF4OSI4|1|Too small; not as depicted
B00F2K2F4C|3|I said fits as expected but my straps slid down so I tie them together.
B004R1K10W|5|I typically wear an extra small/small but I ordered this in large as I'm pregnant. They are long enough to cover my belly. I will definitely buy the smaller size when I get back down to my former size.
B00CTGBEOY|5|This is a great fall outfit. The top looks layered - tank over long sleeves - but it's not two pieces. The color is nice and I really like the fact that the leggings have a little button on the side for some added style. Highly recommend.
B00KZMDWT4|5|I love it, it fit well & very comfortable, thanks for good services
B0029XL078|5|It's been a great purchase. The robe is very soft and comfortable. It's a bit on the larger size, but it shouldn't be a deal breaker. I would buy this again.
B008F4M1T6|4|I was really impressed with the quality considering the price. It is a beautiful bra. The cup material is silky but not stretchy making it less comfy (not terribly). The band also doesn't dig into me and is of decent width. For reference I'm a 38C.<br /><br />Quality - 5/5<br />Price - 5/5<br />Comfort - 3/5<br />Sexy/pretty - 5/5
B00Q7UUHGY|1|I read the reviews stating this item runs small, so I ordered it a size larger ( XL) . I could barely get the top on it was so small. I wear size L.
B008GRRHY6|4|According to previous customer reviews, I ordered a size up.<br />Don't. They run rather big.<br />Otherwise all was good. Satisfied.
B00GI1SN5O|5|This item shipped fast and was a perfect fit (true to size). Same color as the photo as well. I liked the belt, it's well made, I forgot to take it off and accidentally washed and dried it and it came out with all the glitter still on!
B00FJORNMK|5|Nice men's scarf.  The colors are fashionable and it would work for either casual or formal attire.  I wear mine just to keep warm on those really chilly days.  The material is a little light but long enough to wrap around several times.  It's nice to be able to decide if I need one wrap or two.  I would highly recommend this product for either casual or formal use.
B007TLOM4S|4|the graphic is perfect and we still haven't seen it crack (8 weeks - approx. 4 washings)  the sizing was spot on and no shrink.
B003XJG7SY|5|DELIVERY WAS FAST, IM USUALLY A SIZE1-2, BUT THE KILTS MUST BE SIZED LARGER THAN THEIR FIT, BECAUSE THE 4 FIT NICELY, & MY JEANS ARE 1-2'S. OVERALL, VERY PLEASED! THANK TOU, AND I WILL VISIT AGAIN.
B00JZM90IW|4|Super cute dress. Get 2 sizes bigger then what you normally wear. Thin material so a slip is necessary. I would purchase again.
B00IT6P81I|4|For the price, I knew I was getting blue yoga shorts and I figured the fabric would be a bit thin but overall they are perfect for the intended use.
B00MFAK2KG|2|This was supposed to be fabric, but what I got was a small, heavy, silicone cup. It isn't even the same shape as advertised. I highly doubt it will offer any support, let alone fit. Plus, I'm pretty sure you can only wear it once. So that's a waste. Don't bother with this product.
B00372179Q|5|I walk my dogs 4 times a day. In Georgia it rains often. This jacket is very waterproof and it looks great. Excellent buy.
B007LVMQ1C|4|A little large but still really nice  skate pants and very durable I would recommend them but order one size smaller
B009P9IHUC|5|I love hats, turbans and edgy headpieces! This is beautiful and so different!
B00HJTKVX6|2|The expectation was that the threads would be one right thread and one left thread so that when you rotate the turn buckle the end would move out or in.  That's not the case.  The threads are both right hand threrds so you can just set the size and then push it into place.
B008G2U26Q|1|Since you are reading this and considering this pair of jeans, then you own Lucky's brand and know how well they fit.<br /><br />I am listing the CON's first as they are the reason I returned them as soon as I tried them on:<br /><br />1. It is in small print that the actual style of these jeans is given; SLIM FIT<br />2. The picture here does NOT represent this line/style as they fit in real life<br /><br />*Only the color is true*<br /><br />Lucky jeans are know, and are my favorites, for their WELL fitting and high quality.  These are more like a SKINNY version, not the regular (know as REGULAR or VINTAGE STRAIGHT).  These are more homosexuals, or even band members.<br /><br />I am not listing the PRO's as we all know that the name LUCKY JEANS stands for.
B00MAK9D3S|5|Great comfy time hat.  I wear it around the house in the winter with my sweatpants or by the fire with a book.  The brim is wide enough to give some shade from the sun as well.
B007G3D41G|5|I was pleasantly surprised by the overall weight and quality of this sweatshirt.  It is worth much more than it price.
B00L3X39ME|5|The side panels make this quite slimming in appearance.  Dries quickly during workout.
B00BGEGV0C|5|I ordered this as a gift for my friend's son, seeing as though Batman is his father's favorite superhero- and obsession.<br />The little boy, Skylar, has been in the hospital since he was born, so his daddy rarely gets to see him. I thought it would be a nice way of making him feel like he's there with his son.<br />Skylar is almost five months old, so I was kind of afraid this wouldn't fit, but it was perfect!<br />A professional photographer came in while I was visiting him and his mother to give this to them, so she got some great photos of the little guy in this wonderful hat. I'm very, very happy with this purchase. :)
B009DSDX7W|5|Love these shoes. Usually wear a 7.5 or 8 and these 38 M fit perfectly. Great quality for the money and get many<br />compliments when I wear them. Have some leg issues and these make my life a lot easier. When I put them on in the morning I never want to take them off.
B008F4BHUA|4|This is very cute, but the cap sleeves cut off your arms and make them look huge.  If the sleeves were several inches longer it would be perfect.  But this is still wearable if you wear a cardigan on top or if you have skinny arms.
B00F9J230C|1|I usually wear a size 12-14 and am 5' 2&#34;. This blouse was very tight and very short.
B00508VWUO|5|I like this suit. Camo print is fun and the fit is great. I was  looking for something different and this was it.
B00HQ92KDI|4|Fits great.  I love this style of nautical shirt because it doesn't show sweat which is what I need in the south Florida heat and humidity.
B007J5RQN8|4|would recommend
B008GN93AG|5|:)
B00JB9HLUS|4|I like the dress a lot.  It fits nicely.  Martha
B0078L83SK|5|Nice thin material and feel great and keeps one cooler than regular cotton underwear. Fit is expected and they fit nice. Not creepers; they stay in place. The tighty whiteys went in the garbage. As long as the boys are happy I am happy!
B00FARBYPS|5|Love this! I bought the medium and it fits perfectly! Will definitely order more in different colors.
B00N23S0OK|5|I ordered this dress a little bigger than I usually wear and it fit very well. It is comfortable too.
B00A7QU9WG|2|I like fairly tight undershirts so they don't look sloppy.  I'm 6'2\\" and 180.  I go to the gym a lot but I'm not huge and bulky.  These shirts were nearly impossible to put on and they required my wife's help to pull off!  My other Hanes undershirts were size Large but these Large super slims were way too small.  Beware - and order up a size or three.
B00N9O05QS|5|Love this! Fits perfectly
B00C510LRO|5|I ordered a medium, and it fits perfectly. It's such a beautiful, well-made dress. The slightly Victorian flavor makes it stand out from my other &#34;hippie&#34; dresses. Great for a party or a night out!
B000UJDM1K|5|great
B00KY9TNVE|4|like them, fitted well
B0052RQ3YS|3|I bought these for a Weeping Angel costume ( Doctor Who). they worked well for what I needed with some modifications except the wings are not flexible. They jut out from the back do not fold out flat and they have a  flimsy stretchy  lace straps to hold them on to your body. So I bought 2 pieces of Velcro strapping and used those to make them more stable on my back. I also painted them grey. I bought the black pair and using a light coating or grey hair dye was able to get the stone grey color needed for the costume without them warping too much. Over all they worked for what I needed with some minor adjustments and were a heck a lot easier then making my own
B00ISLAI3M|5|i wish the neckband was  cut a  tiny bit lower,no big deal tho, i addition i would prefer just to have the label printed in the back of shirt instead of the heat applied &#34;sticker&#34; thing. I'm about to order 10 more,all in all i would recommend them to anyone.
B001BMOL6A|4|Great fit for me and comfortable
B00O6UXEA8|4|I gave this top four stars only because of the size. It says to size close to what you wear but I decided to go up two sizes just to be on the safe side and glad that I did! I am 5'4 150lbs 38c and normally wear a medium when it comes to this design shirt. I ordered an xl and it fits perfect! It would fit like a standard &#34;mall size medium.&#34; The material is silky and soft and the looks just like the photo shown above. I really like it, just be careful with the size.
B00MHNL5JS|2|I ordered a XL and its still does not fit
B00G6ZTOL4|5|My girls love these soft, comfortable pajama pants. They each have many pairs. Every time I look for some and they have their size I order more. Awesome!!!
B00JB8P3A4|4|Loved the coat but is was too small.  Gave it to another that it will fit and will order an XL for original recipient
B00OZ150OG|2|It may work for some.  I suggest getting one size bigger.  Unless your STANDING only it may not roll up or down.  For me it wasn't going to work, being active.
B00E72S7KM|5|I liked the look online, but it exceeded my expectations in quality and my husband really loves it.  Fits well, launders well and I couldn't be more pleased with it.
B00DWCEBYY|5|I ordered this tie for my girlfriend, she looks great in bow ties. I especially love its bright colors and patterns. What is really great, is the option to wear it bold or to wear it on the pattern side. It lasts through the night and stays tied. She always gets compliments on it. I also have ordered the same, just in different colors, and they are all wonderful.  Its a great product for those who enjoy the self-tie bow ties. These arent clips and do not come with any velcro. When you wear it on the bold color side you can still catch a glimpse of the pattern an it adds a nice flare to it.
B00IPS1TUE|5|I bought these for my totally disabled grandson because they are easy to get on, the fabric is wonderful and they are cute.
B002IORQ1C|4|I wanted red running pants for a Jingle Bell race I was in. These pants are just okay and what expected. The fabric is not very comfortable and I felt like my stomach was being squeezed towards the end of the race. I figured the quality wouldn't be that great though since the price is pretty cheap. If you're just needing a certain solid color legging and don't want to spend a lot of money I think these are just fine.  For a 5K they'd be great for  costumed running, though any more miles than that you may want to pay the extra $$ because they do get uncomfortable.
B00F0O8H6K|4|Ordered this shirt and its great. Only problem I ordered a large and got sent an X large. How can something so simple get screwed up?
B00BU1ZGM0|1|Not sure how to send these back. Too short to small and I ordered a size up.
B009EVVHVM|5|Lol I like the face on it, and its keeps my head warm of course. Its not Perry, its a Agent P beanie.
B00HD0HJ0O|4|My son loves the TMNT. However he was only able to wear this outfit once since it shrunk after first wash.
B00KOGS5SE|5|Great buy
B00GHISPME|3|Good support, but a C cup is more like a B cup
B009UTLWY0|4|Love it. Warm & seems well made. Only wish there was a way to adjust the size - a little big for my little bean head.
B0051D4SYA|5|I chose the 5 star rating because these jeans actually fit me.  I am over 70 and wear a size 18 - with a smaller than usual waist and a 31 inch inseam.  These jeans fit, and are of a good construction quality.  They've been washed several times and there is no shrinkage so far.  I will be buying more of these.
B002B934WE|5|I ordered the black dress in small and the pink one in medium. The small fit perfect. I'm 5'1 115lbs. The pink was too big so I returned it. Shipping is super fast. Ordered them Saturday night and received then by Tuesday (I think they give a big window to be safe). I returned the pink one and was refunded within two days! Got lots of compliments on the dress. I definitely recommend the dress and the company! :)
B00DZPD5B8|4|Nice quality, especially for the price but you may want to consider ordering a size up.  I comfortably wear size 36 waisted pants and don't have particularly large thighs.  Size large is a very snug fit for me.
B00EMG3WIA|4|These are ok, but never used them. They are pretty small so my baby outgrew them by 2 month
B004NC5YWA|4|very nice pin.  got compliments at lodge
B00ER1U22E|5|Goooooood!!!
B00BBW6PZK|5|This is my go to hat. I am always outside, working with the animals, or hiking, riding etc. This hat is very comfortable and I love that it is made from Organic cotton. My head is on the smaller side, and I love that it is adjustable.<br />I would recommend this hat.
B00BTPV7GQ|5|It came as a surprise and she loves it. It was a perfect fit and looks even nicer in person
B008SI06YQ|3|I can not use this item it would fit a child nothing else to write not necessary to write so much
B005PJ1EZG|2|Was trying to find the original jeans called Texas Twill. These were loose and not true black. Still trying to locate Texas Twill Levi's !
B00OTYNKS2|4|It Strunk a little when I washed it be careful when washing just air dry it
B0031BGPN6|5|When I saw the belt, I didn't think that the adjustment system was a good idea. But my son, who actually wears the belt, said that he likes it better than the typical sliding adjuster that was on his old belt. To adjust this belt, you unsnap one or both ends and slide the belt through the buckle loops. I think he likes how the silver snaps look on the belt.
B002RHF798|3|Made it just in time. Added a breast plate and choker. Looked great.
B0006M7V1I|2|There are clearly different grades of fabric in Levi's jeans. A pair of 513 I bought at Nordstrom and a pair I bought at the Levi's store have much, MUCH nicer fabric than these and a pair from Macy's. This fabric is thin and cheap. Also these things fit HUGE. Far bigger than any other 513s I bought of the same size. Disappointed.
B000A414PG|5|I have worn a Nubra for years and get a new one every season because I've worn the old one out!  For summer tanks and dresses it's a no brainer.  Press and go - with cleavage that no other bra can give me.  I'd like to invest in the company.
B003ZSH8XQ|5|Great quaility. Husband loves it.
B00UR4YA6E|5|I like this dress because it's really airy and I always stay cool when wearing this.
B00MCNBT94|5|These Ahh  by Rhonda Shear Racerback Bras are so comfortable that I can forget that I'm wearing a bra.  One of the problems I've had with other leisure (sports bras for me) bras is that they creep up over my bust - now that is just not right!!  I'm very small busted, and take an XS in this style...which has the same bottom band as the regular leisure bras, so they stay in place with no &#34;creeping!!&#34;  The racerback style gives me the same confidence as the regular back leisure bras (of which I have 4 now!)...they stay in place; the fabric is soft and comfortable, and they are easy to get on and off - even when very sweaty!!  I Love These Bras!!
B00C7TJLB6|5|Bought as a gift for my teenage daughter and she loves it!!! Also sent friends online looking for it as well:)
B004498ESI|4|This is a great set of thermals, very hard to find for those of us my size (350lbs).  Best of all it is just large, not large and flowing, so without being tight at all, it's not baggy under other pants.
B00L40OTCU|5|I love this shirt. It's so comfortable and soft.
B00E786LVI|4|Fast shipping but to small.
B009RAEHAI|5|Like this fits great!
B0036G9A24|3|The product looked and felt good quality but they fit entirely too large. Didn't notice much of a &#34;stretch&#34; like stated in description but that didn't matter because they swallowed me. I could have fit both legs in one leg. Returned.
B004LCZEPO|5|They stretch and fit her perfect. Have a nice wet look and form to her arm, well worth the cost
B00IT2E6VA|5|They are exactly as described. Purchased as a gift.
B008L53P6M|5|So far very good
B00RKJEBRW|1|We ordered the pants and got a shirt.
B0042TZZFA|5|THanks
B009MINOFO|3|all good
B00IWQO1GI|5|I love that this onsie is PLUSH and not fleece. I love the softness/velvety texture compared to fleece
B004070P18|3|These are very soft and pretty but fragile. The loops catch on things and bits shed off when washed as directed. They are not as stretchy as I thought they would be. I'll enjoy wearing them, but I don't think they'll last very long.<br />They arrived quickly and in good shape.
B0078ENAX0|5|carhartt always meets our expectations
B000EVHPOO|3|the robe came and it was not really luxury- <br />i bought an extra large and it was super size- think a 300lb person and over 6 feet tall- <br />the colour was not very strong a very muted pink- not like the picture at all <br />overall not a robe to covet- just a regular robe which i probably could have gotten cheaper at the mall.
B008H5WTMW|2|These are too small for an XLarge
B004M6UDC8|5|keeps my pc/tablet items organized.
B00M9X04DE|5|It is so cute!  I tied it to the front of a shower gift, so they would know immediately who it was from.  It was a big hit.  Now if only the baby would come so I could see it on her.
B00LNWALIA|4|Does the job.
B00G7KQZE2|5|I love this!!! I will always on the lookout for baby stuff from Petit Lem! Excellent quality down to the clothing tags are pretty!
B00FGJFAX2|4|Love how it feels weightless but worried I might<br />be showing too much but as it garnered appreciative glances & not the lascivious sneer, it was alright. hope it lasts me a long time.Great for summer paired with a long tunic<br />or T-shirt.
B00A1C45VM|5|Great product! I love it, fits perfect and is awesome looking. Fast shipping as well! Definitely recommend this!
B00BGCXRSS|5|This is the best fitting bra I've ever owned. It is also very comfortable. I bought several bras from Amazon to compare and this one wins by a huge margin. I usually don't like underwire bras but this one is the exception! I will certainly buy more.
B00PE5ZT9I|5|My husband enjoyed receiving it for Father's Day!
B00HSYYS9K|5|Really cute hoodie
B00IJXIEEO|5|Great fit, shipped quick, good quality.
B007OX49SK|5|My husband loves these pajamas, and sometimes I like to borrow them, too :) They are soft, comfy, and lightweight.
B00E8NOA9W|5|my dad bought me this from his workplace seens he works a caterpillar and this is truly the best hat i owned in my entier life i never want to take it off warm comfy i just lost mine a week ago though and with temps in the -50 i need a new one so ill be ordering one again today :)
B00BEFP1TA|5|This dress is even prettier than the internet photo. I bought this dress for my 9 year old daughter and it is a little big but I bought it a size bigger than most of her clothes. If you have a skinny girl, it may hang a little low in the back. I would love to find a shrug to accompany it but have had no luck yet. This dress is fully lined and could snag easily, I wouldn't use it for school. Beautiful dress on the right girl!!!
B004747XSC|2|The beanie is pretty warm but I was expecting the beanie in the picture. The beanie sent to me was more of a plain style, not as white as I expected, and had a flower on the side. No where in the picture did I see a flower... A little too pricey for something I wasn't expecting. But shipping was great, I do appreciate the fast shipping lol
B00STV5AC0|5|Cute design, priced appropriately for a one-time event. I would have preferred a polo shirt, but I can make the T-shirt work.
B009O8M04S|5|Hugs the baby bump well, while ruched sides camouflage the less even bumps.  Super comfy.  Just a bit long for me.  I am 5'2&#34; and 27 weeks.  Can be dressed up or down!
B007UXMQXO|5|Product was as expected. Works perfectly with our Carnival Cruise Lines luggage tags.
B009YAPMU0|5|I love this shirt. Fits beautifully. People always ask me about the &#34;Angel Dust&#34; thing though.
B000F76PMK|5|I have fibromyalgia so find it very difficult to wear any kind of bra (very uncomfortable).  So I wear camisoles but with some tops I  still need something on my boobs so I use these along with fashion tape and place one piece of tape on each side of the cup and tape them to the inside of the camisole and they work great! They can be sewn in but I found I like just taping them in better.  If you have big boobs, they won't give much support but since I don't have that problem they work very well  for me.
B00BU3BTWE|5|Great quality, made well, just runs a little small
B00N35OF32|5|Very nice indeed.  Soft, thin, but good enough for winter.
B00FMF1WDW|4|I don't usually wear hats out in public. But I love this one, and have had many compliments!<br />Quick delivery!
B0034KY4NM|4|I have had this for couple of years now and love it but the inside mesh part has untwisted and just not as supportive anymore and I have no clue how to twist it back :(
B00LZ0HJDA|5|I was happily surprised by the fit, fabric, and price of this dress - a great buy all around!  This was my first time purchasing this brand but with this example, I will be shopping for it in the future.
B00C7BNWQY|5|She loves the hoodie
B006WQ08RQ|5|This is a terrific little T-Shirt, holds up well on an active four year old and multiple washes.  It is a bit snug on her and most things we buy for her are loose. The price is great so we may buy her another one to make it through the last few months of summer and early fall.
B00T6SNCQQ|5|Nice shirt, will probably purchase from this vendor again.
B005ERJTN8|5|One of my favorite hobbies is to collect pins for the cities to which I travel. I have collected pins of many European cities and have put them on my backpack. I would hate to lose any of them. There were many moments during which I almost lost one or two pins. So, I decided to find alternative pin holders. The pin keepers are really sturdy and put my city pins in the right place. I highly recommend this product!
B00IEDASIO|5|It keeps my head warm!
B000HKIC7G|5|I tried several different sweat band products and this one ended my search. I am a heavy sweater and this is the only product that could keep up!
B00K2Z725O|5|Excellent
B00S5MBL9O|5|👍👍👍👍
B00B7QEQ38|5|Good
B000PCGN4U|3|looks like a great bra but it was too big in the cup and around my framr
B00W666UL4|5|Comfortable and functional top with easy access for breastfeeding. Material feels great and is pretty much my go-to outfit paired with leggins or jeans for running errands.
B005NRRC1A|3|You get what you pay for in this case. It's flimsy and thin but not obnoxiously poorly made. My biggest issue are the sleeves - I look and feel like a wizard! They are long, wide and loose. There is no way to roll them up. I could live in a bathrobe on a lazy day, just not in this particular one.
B00590JNOK|2|The fit, style and color of the dress was just perfect. However, one of the yellow feather designs in the print happened to give the appearance of a nice big splotch of yellow right in the front. For me, it was a deal breaker. Can't go to a wedding looking like I spilled mustard on my crotch.
B00KFDTCMO|5|So cute on my 10 yr old daughter, and she is very happy with them.
B003CSJ2D8|4|nice &#34;every-day&#34; type dress, not fancy but very comfie
B00JTTBRKA|5|Very comfy!
B0088LYY5A|1|This is a bunch of garbage.  A lot of feathers were broken and fuzzes fly all over.  Would not recommend
B00FMA1Q9C|3|Ripped in a month! Other than that its nice um if your over 6ft do not buy its to short
B00VDAG032|5|These shorts fit great. Like the description says to order a size larger than normal so that was a great heads up. They are comfortable and soft. Will be great for the summer!
B00519BD9C|4|These work great until I actually go up a cup size. Easy to use, pretty straight forward. This is preventing me from buying multiple new bras as my pregnancy continues.
B00KC7PGMI|5|Item received was exactly as described and quick shipping.
B007FDOX30|5|Very nice! Especially for the price. Was just like i thought it would be. Fit great , its light weight perfect for the summer weather. Was shipped promptly also
B00FB34VA6|4|I purchased this belt set for my husband for Christmas. The belts are very appealing visually, and look great with any type of pants. They run true to size (hubby is a 38, so I selected the 40-42) and have ample buckle holes. The belts are a bit stiff to begin with, but after several wears, they are much more pliable now. One of the belts in this set is a camo print and the other belt is brown, with an embellishment made from a real shot gun shell.
B00916QB0M|5|calsmd just in time cor christmas!  loved them vreat fit for my tiny teen ,th a nk you amazon for always getting it right
B00EU9PGC4|5|GRT BUY
B005GPMSWM|5|Everyday winter favorite. I would like it in several colors.  It is just loose enough without being baggy. I'll buy more.
B003JBIT82|5|This is exactly what I wanted. Just got it last week so I need to see how it looks after a wash or two.
B00NUXOKPU|1|See through skirt even though the skirt is a thick material.
B004TERK2E|5|Thank you so much it's very soft and warm I love it so much .
B001N2XX6M|4|Light weight but rather noisy like a plastic bag.  Must be the materials they are made from.  Some static cling.
B00FT75E32|2|Ok
B00LCFPG24|5|Very comfortable.  A podiatrist stopped me while we were on vacation (Bainbridge Island) and I was in shorts and told me that the socks I was wearing might give me a stroke.  At the time I had a lot of ankle swelling (since much reduced by adjusting meds).  He recommended essentially orthopedic socks, which I have tried but find difficult to put on and not particularly comfortable.  These are a good compromise -- they go on and wear like regular socks and stay up reasonably well -- but they do not have the heavy duty elastic that some socks have that cause or retain ankle swelling.  Highly recommended -- but beware of the packaging -- it is a real pain to clip through all the little nylon retainers.
B0043O6ENG|5|This is a great tshirt for the price. Fits a bit larger then usual but is still a good t.
B004SE228M|3|The underwear is ok BUT I the colors are odd too me. The colors they sent me are purple, lime green, bright blue etc. I have nothing against color BUT these colors are ideal for clowns. If you don't mind bright colored underwear- this is the underwear for you. Also, they run small.
B00VR2HBUM|3|I wasn't crazy about the material compared to my other &#34;Lucky&#34; tees. It wasn't very forgiving & showed everything. I returned it but the color is great just like pictured.
B00C61OEJO|5|This Jax dress fits wonderfully!  I've never purchased clothing off Amazon before but I have a few Jax dresses that I've purchased at Lord & Taylor so I took a risk and bought this one.  I absolutely love it!  It looks even better on a girl with curvy hips. The peplum doesn't stick out at all and the black panels have a slimming effect. Plus I got the dress for about $45 which was totally a bargain!
B00DJMCLIK|5|The jacket looks great, it seems to follow size categories well and the leather is great quality. The zippers on the breast pocket are rather flashy for my taste but as a whole a great purchase.
B00A2OJZLY|5|Very happy with product, the color we expected and the fit.<br />Was very leary about buying a shirt offline and not trying it on, but really needed the color for something specific.<br />Worked out great for us!
B000GIQVK4|5|These are super cute. Love them.
B00HWUTOZS|3|Normal size purchased: Small/Petite....this size Small was indeed too small.<br />Didn't particularly like the material or feel of the material. The double action zipper was not real easy to engage.
B00DR1EZ4Q|5|Easy to set up and  then it's a perfect fit.  Attractive buckle? Suppe material that fels like it should last
B00DUZACIC|4|I ordered the medium because they didn't have a large so it was a little tight for my 5'2 and 140 lbs. It was so cute I didn't want to return it so I gave it to my younger sister who is 120 lbs and 5'4. She loves it!
B0030IU8FG|5|I have been wearing these for several months now, and I own several pairs of them. I have literally worn these to church, then to build a shed in the same day. They are professional looking, so I have turned them into part of my work uniform. They may seem stiff at first, but they relax over time. They also resist stains, and shed rain and snow pretty well.
B00ARDCG70|5|These are so cute! Great product and good quality.
B00JSS1YY6|3|good feel but under sized
B00GA7VXWQ|5|great buy
B002N6Y77Q|1|The vest is like plastic and is so cheap if I knew it was like this I wouldn't of ordered it its so cheap what a rip off
B005G0RB74|2|The Fabric is nice but runs  big.  I am M and I ordered a 10.  it is too large ...... is have to adjust it to size 6...... even though I am  a Medium
B009GES4QI|5|So comfortable!
B000VZR462|2|Cloths shrunk a lot and wasn't too comfortable. Wasn't too happy, cause they go to small.  Get a size bigger
B005NCJT3E|4|The shirt is good quality and was great for an LMFAO Halloween Costurme. Would recommend that you go one size up especially if you like it a little loose.
B00FAXKPES|5|Very Cute on Her
B00CPQ9AMG|5|Favorite thing I have bought for my wife. Love it
B003OQTW56|4|The waist fits to size just the loose fit in the butt and legs is bigger than I expected.....However they are good looking jeans!
B00X5H15O0|4|I expected this to run small and ordered the 3 xl.  It fits perfect and I wear a US size 12.
B003XD3CBU|4|Almost satisfied, but slightly larger than babe's waist. It need to be a little smaller. Except that, I have no complain.
B00L2YU9C2|3|I like it, I just wish it was a bit more tight fitting for my frame
B004PEA6IS|2|The size of this bag is ok, big enough to carry all the things I need. The color is very nice (natural-beige), the snake texture looks great, the metallic parts are very solid and very shinny, I like the A X lock. This bag is made of PVC: plastic, it smells so strong it makes makes me nauseous. I own cheap bags, made of PVC, and they dont smell like this one, they dont smell at all. Even my stuff started to smell like plastic, and I stopped using the bag. I hope this smell fades eventually. I cant ship it back, because the shipping would cost me more. Overall the bag looks great, but the smell is sooo strong. If the smell fades away, I will definitely use it again.
B00CLYY2D4|5|Love the colors, the size and material. The material isn't so big and bulky which is more flattering. The size is great, it fit around my neck comfortably twice! I am very pleased with it!
B00SGALWDU|5|In love with this skirt. It's perfect for summer! And for once a sort isn't too long for me
B00AJ338SY|5|a little long in arms..room to grow.
B00NUCETTI|5|Christmas gift for our daughter-in-law
B007D3EWCY|5|this is an awesome shirt i love it and i love the show!
B000OKYB7E|1|were not assorted colors...all white, why?  cost too much to return considering the value of the package...just settled for incorrect order
B00F0UMYHW|4|I do like this coat.  It is warm.  My daughter, just turned 3, wore it last season but is def getting small now, esp sleeve length.
B0064YY8PY|5|Have worn this shaper for several years  I was so glad to be able to find it on Amazon and at a great price.
B008BLO6BE|5|nice hat and excellent merchant
B004M6UDC8|4|Great product, would order again! Exactly as described but have only 4 stars because of slight wear showing after only a month.
B00C9XN7FG|4|Wonderful buy. Will be great for the little one for winter in Idaho.
B00ACIHBV6|5|Great fit, comfortable, nice designs. We've washed these a dozen times so far and they are holding up quite well. Would purchase again.
B00GEKONNA|4|My daughter thought the dress was absolutely fabulous! She followed the measurements and ordered a small, but when She tried it on it was huge! So definitely order about a size smaller. Over all the dress was gorgeous
B00MN627EQ|4|These pajamas are very soft. I love the fabric. I ordered a medium which I need for my waist hips. The fit for me was the top was oversized but comfy & wearable as a nightgown. The bottoms are a tight fit although they fit in length and I'm petite (under 5'). Washes nicely.
B004L6Y0T6|5|It fits perfectly on my collectors wall.
B0044BBS4I|5|this is my favorite nursing bra for wearing with work clothes etc. It's comfy and easy to unsnap. The straps are a little on the thick side, but it's nice overall
B00G10OBC6|4|I ordered as suggested, one size up, and they fit great. After washing and drying, there was no change in fit. They are lightweight but very warm. I am very pleased with this purchase and would deffinitely purchase again.
B008KKSIK6|4|I bought it a size big so that he'd have room to grow into it.  I washed it once and not sure it it shrunk or not, but I wish I had bought bigger now.  He says it's perfect, and the fabric IS quite soft.  Very nice robe, but I'll have to buy him a new one sooner than I'd like.
B00NBINAL4|5|I'm satisfied. It looks very nice. (: & it arrived in less than a week even after it told me it would arrive in a month!! :D
B00O81WBRW|5|It's a pretty hot shirt!
B00IUGHI1U|4|Good quality and material.Shipping was fast.love it.
B00NWWD7EE|3|Ok here goes: I have several corsets and am working my way up to making my own Victorian style over bust corset. Making them involves intricate sewing ability and expensive tools. I say this because I read through some of the comments and I have to give my opinion and rebuttal.<br /><br />First off you aren't supposed to be able to bend in the middle!!!! Corsets were garments that not only added to a woman's silhouette which was highly sought after in the Victorian era by aiding in her posture and thinning the waist. Thinning of the waist was also exaggerated by the large skirt and many petticoats. Corsets were also seen as a way of protecting women's delicate organs.. It goes into that whole weaker sex thing.. There for bending in the middle was not something that happened. Therefore this aspect is not a valid reason for a poor review!<br /><br />Second off there are currently 3 kinds of bones (not counting the front busk) plastic, flexible metal bones, and steel wound. Plastic is fashion corset boning and does little if anything for shaping. The flexible metal bones can be mistaken for plastic bones but there is s big difference! The steel wound bones are the serious business and my preference.<br /><br />Btw just an aside. Women did NOT break ribs or have floating ribs removed to accentuate their shape in the corset. If you think about medicine today that would be a tricky surgery and broken ribs would be considered a great injury! Ribs are more flexible and meant to expand and contract! I have seen illustrations and even actual rib cages of corset wearing women.. Nothing missing nothing broken simply molded!<br /><br />Ok sorry I had to get these things off my chest before I could share my pros and cons here.<br />Pros:<br />Good construction of fabric nice firm fabric that works well over my Victorian undergarments! Really love it for this!! Seasoning will be easy with this tough beauty!<br /><br />Cons:<br />Not the best metal components. The front busk doesn't feel as rigid as I am used to and was hard to close. I usually have a difficult time the first couple of times I'm hooking the front busk but it was bending a bit more than usual.<br />The bones are not the promised steel wound but they are also not the plastic ones (someone mentioned they thought they were plastic) these are the steel rods that are flexible but help give it strength. These are occasionally called &#34;white bones&#34;<br /><br />The only other problem I have with this corset is that it is long (since its an over bust) and the laces are too long. Thankfully I have another over bust that I don't like the fit of and I can steal the laces from that one!<br />I was hopeful for this corset and will love and wear it but it wasn't what it looked like it would be.
B00062NHGG|5|Perfect
B005P7N64K|3|It's smaller than my actual size although I went a size larger than usual. I guess it supports by being tight? Not my favorite bra.
B009GE3YHC|4|It is and amazing corset for this price. The boobs are pretty small, if you have more than a C i suggest a different corset.
B00ELN006G|5|I like this scarf a lot.  It shipped quickly and it is soft as well as pretty.  I lack imagination so the infinity scarves are a perfect way for me to look put together easily.
B008S1X87U|5|My ten year old son loves this tie. He wears it when we play Monoply. Was so excited to find it!<br />Thank you!
B00EAYIEXM|5|Just received these hats for my two daughters and I absolutely love them!!! I have a one and a half and a three year old and they both fit great.I wish there were gloves to match!!
B00N9RVFMI|5|I'm 5'3&#34;/40D. I bought the black in 2X and 3X, and the beige in 2X. Size 2X seems to be like a size 14. I wear them often, and they still look very nice after washing in the machine and hanging to dry. I want to buy the green one, but they're always out of stock.
B00CU9GECW|5|Love it! Very sexy! Looks better with a push up bra if you don't have large breasts. Fits true to size. The zippers are gold, but not a big deal. For the price- you can't beat it! If you are between sizes, go a size down. I almost wish I had ordered a small. Seller ships very fast- took about a week. Very comfortable and flattering as well.
B00IAC3DMC|5|Fit pretty good...just a hair large for me, a woman, but looked good and perfect for my granddaughters birthday party!
B005NWMSTQ|5|My daughter loves 2ne1 and these were the cutest socks ever. They are the best!  Socks shipped fast, were packaged well, and were good quality.
B00OLA43X0|5|I bought several of these hats because of the durability and fit. Great for fishing or for just hanging on the weekend. The come in many different colors and brand combinations. They're my favorite brands of hats.
B000A3I3O2|5|Great price  Good Quality  I bought it nice and large so it can shrink a little  and still have plenty of room ....  Will get plenty of wear in the Fall
B00JU9LY34|5|The Father loved it and really liked it. It fit very well. The shirt looked really nice, and the sand color looked great. The sand color contrasted well with the blue. It was great!
B00WAI7VZC|5|They are a bit see threw but all white things are. Make your butt look great !
B00NO9L3XM|5|Just for sizing purposes, I found a size M was ginormous on my usual size 8 5'10&#34; self. Borderline swallowing me whole. But. I washed/dried on gentle to shrink the rayon content a little and it worked perfectly. Fabric drape & feel is nice and comfy. I'm too lazy to send them back and try Smalls, but for others reference, this might help.
B0051U182I|5|I work as an overnight security guard and am on my feet about 85% of night. Not only are these socks warm but they also provide a lot of cushioning on your feet. I've bought 3 pairs and my feet are always nice and warm during my shifts at night.
B00FX9ZAQW|4|I was on the edge between M and L and so ordered the XL based on other reviews that it ran very small. I ended up returning the XL and getting the L and it fits great. Love the cut. It's well-made and warm.
B00CBAOEMW|5|Ordered medium and fits great for a 32x32
B007IM52BA|2|if you are shorter than 5'6 it will be huge on you do not waste your money on this teddy
B009KM5GTY|1|Dress was absolutely too small. Looks like it was sized incorrectly. Did not return because there was no invoice included in the package with return instructions. Definitely will not order dresses from them again.
B00A2HNWQK|5|Nice Material, fits well, so far has held up to washing. Showed up 2 days earlier than expected as well!
B00LVOR4XK|2|Product is fine but I ordered it in the winter and got it in the spring!!!!  Will not order from them again.
B008HQI1UA|5|The Letter H silver cuff links are exactly like they were presented in the advertising.  I'm happy with my purchase.
B00L6GKHKA|4|She loves them she will eventually grow into them I misunderstood the sizing.
B00Y03YDGA|5|Looks great, feels great, and expands well! I actually got it for a friend and we're cosplaying later this month at otakon. He's a size 25-ish waist and even i think it could fit my size 36 waist if i tried it on. It really looks like one size fits all. Came very timely and actually pretty early so im happy about that. :) my only precaution is that you wear something under because it might show private parts if it expands too much lol Great product and excellent shipping :)
B002XRD6L8|5|I am one satisfied customer! The bandana is perfect to wear while riding my motorcycle. Put the tubular mask on underneath and it blocks out all the wind and bugs.
B00D83XBI4|4|My grandson likes his new coat. It's perfect for the season in California  & priced well since they grow so fast
B007KJ3BIM|5|This short set is very sheik. My grandson looks so handsome in this outfit. I love it!  Quality in baby clothing is what I like.
B00A9ME77G|5|A+
B00MBHUBHC|1|I get the fact that everyone wants to grab onto the newest craze in internet lingo, but research should really be done before a word is so widely used. Bae, is this context, is MEANT to mean babe, girlfriend/boyfriend, etc. But what seems to be NOT realized is the true meaning of the word. Bae is a Danish word, and it means &#34;poop&#34;. All these people thinking they're cute, using the new supposed endearing term, when they are actually calling their significant other excrement. Lovely hipster society we live in.
B000B5XY52|5|I have used this item and it seems to work very well.  The add said it is merino wool but in fact it only has a very small amount of Merino wool in it.  I wanted a pant that was all merino wool and didn't read the fine print before I purchased this item.  It is good for what it is and I'll probably continue using it until I can find what I really want. <br /> <br />Stocky
B00FXQ2BRG|5|I am 6' tall and about 290, this shirt in 3XLT is plenty long and big, no more plumbers crack or flashing your belly if you raise your arms.  It comes down to my mid thigh and is really spacious around the gut.  I haven't washed it yet, but it would have to shrink like crazy in order not to fit me.  I was tired of trying other sites and ordering their equivalent thinking I was getting a deal for a $5 shirt.  Yeah they fit out of the box but as soon as you wash those cheapos, you just provided the goodwill with some clothes.
B0081FZ7LI|4|Haven't washed/dried them yet. May shrink. Going to order another pair with pockets.
B00JLB5BFS|4|Versatile accessory. Good quality. True to size.
B009WS4EVC|4|The belt is 100% alike the photo. it's lovely and it's perfect for a black dress. I can use in the waist and in the hip.
B00EAHFLYY|4|Great shirt for any teenage mutant ninja turtles fan. The screen printing on it is perfect, absolutely no imperfections. Fit was perfect, true to size. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because it had the strangest smell when we  opened the package. No idea what it was, but we both thought it was nasty and definitely needed to be washed before even touching.
B002EWZNMC|2|You know how you go into your local dollar store and buy socks and they are flimsy and they just won't make it over 5 months? That's what these are. They are so lightweight and I was looking for heavier weight, so I donated these to the Salvation Army since I'm sure someone out there will appreciate them, but not me.
B002UIEBPU|5|My favorite bra from wacoal.  This is the only bra that does not slide down my shoulders.
B005O1WZHQ|5|This hat is good for my granddaughter. She is 1 year old. It still will feet till 2 years old.<br />It was very helpful at the pool and in the see.  It is a good protection from the sun.
B007IRM1OQ|5|Fits great. Arrived quick. Bottom of shirt is extra long so doesn't shrink up after washed.
B00BV6731G|1|after wearing once washed and it almost fell apart, two holes just appeared in the back.
B00F6HQEFW|5|really nice it does look real i hope will last long time!
B00J3WZ6SC|1|This is how the fabric contents are described on Amazon :STYLE: TWNMS314S, 312S, 315S: 65% Cotton, 30% Nylon 5% spandex<br /><br />This is the actual product quality when you receive this white shirt :65%  Nylon, 32% cotton, 3% spandex.<br /><br />This shirt is see through quality and it feels like wearing an umbrella.  I bought two same shirts with different color; one white and one black.<br />The black shirt's material tag shows : 65% cotton, 32% Nylon, and 3% spandex.
B0044BVTU6|5|Fits well. I yet to try them in hiking trails with humid evening, rain, and hot or cold days.
B00LCZU2IW|5|Purchased for my daughter after searching locally for a warm, good quality coat for the cold winters in the NE. This coat is perfect, heavy, well made and the price was amazing!
B00GDGT85I|4|shape and quality quite good for the price. Side pockets slightly to small. The polyesther fabric makes your hair stand up as you wear the coat during activities like fast walks with your dog and shake hands is sometimes an electriciting experience. But over all: I love it.
B00880B6IE|3|Its from Hong Kong to be expected workmanship
B0059DXQRM|4|also bought the skirt and pants.  the jacket fits a tiny bit larger than normal.  I ordered a 10.  sleeves<br />about 1 1/2 inches too long.  will take to tailor to shorten as the lining will have to be cut to.<br />but would still buy again.
B005JEFI5Y|4|It's a great shirt, however the print on it started to fade BAD after the first wash. It's fine, it just doesn't look as crisp and new as it did. I've only washed it 3 times now.
B003GXFTH2|2|Unexpected cheap leather for a Bridle Belt.Won't have utility of similar belts I have by Docker's & Fossil of substantially superior quality
B00L4KI3DQ|2|I ordered it in my regular size but this must be  cut small so it was too tight.
B00A65Z4W8|4|The PattyBoutik Cowl Neck Buttong embellished Ruched Blouse fits perfect and love the feel of the material. I will most likely purchase another one like it.
B0034G65RO|5|Wife loves them they fit great
B00MFJ0IN8|5|very well made and fits perfectly.
B00AEZ662C|5|This pair of glove was ordered with some reserve.  I wear gloves often because of neuropathy and wanted a dressier pair to have instead of the white cotton gloves I buy at the local pharmacy (ill fitting but do the job).  These Finale Gloves fit very well and do the job of protecting my hands.  I ordered the white and the black and will now order several colors as available.  I wore the black gloves to a formal Marine Corp. League Ball !  Very pleased with this purchase.
B009N2ABM8|5|Very very I like it  feat me very good
B00JHCOLRU|5|i like it a lot
B00PYKP42K|5|Love this set! Cute and classy!  Hat has elastic allowance on back so it can fit a wide range of head sizes. I get compliments every time I wear it.
B00ACIH9UE|5|these appear to be very nice shorts, they were sent on to a friend in Ghana, West Africa.  I am sure he will find them very nice
B00SW330TK|2|Too large had to return
B000W8TZWO|5|Another great amazon offer. These gloves are very cheap and extreamly warm. They aren't too big when you wear them with your jacket, but i would suggest getting less bulky gloves if you are just wearing a hoodie or a thin jacket... otherwise your hands might stick out a bit.<br /><br />They are very comfortable and taking them on and off is smooth as ice. The only problem i have is that the thumb section is a bit too long, and makes gripping things just that much harder.
B00I8ZZPHW|5|My daughter loved it, she took it to Fiji! and it was a nice looking quick cover up!
B00L8BULAY|5|Those pants are awesome!  My son loves them. They fit perfect, the color and design is cool, I will buy again! Thank you!
B00AYVWMLA|5|espectacular muy hermoso... buena calidad y el envio rapido, los detalles bien echos.. me facino me encanto y la talla muy aceptable
B00I966QHS|4|These are nice, I've bought 4 more. The Grey one doesn't have a full hood, so that's kinda weird.
B002ALSUYA|3|I purchased this as added flare to my lolita-samurai costume.  I picked it based on the photo, it appeared more glamorous than the average short petticoat.  Unfortunately the photo is not very indicative of the actual petticoat (look it up by Leg Avenue tulle petticoat to see what it really looks like; if you only want white you'll also find it cheaper).  It's more sheer and longer.  And as I was worried, the one-size means a tight elastic waistband.  I'm a size 6 and it still pinches.  It's fuller than I expected.  However, it was mailed quickly and the color options may make it worth it to you.  I just got the white.  It will work for my costume, though, so I'm not worried about it.  If I want to use it in the future, I'll probably make adjustments to the waistband.
B002BFKZXY|5|This is a high quality scarf! It is great! The color is perfect and it is very soft! I could wear it with anything! I am going to order these in more colors for gifts!
B00RPSR1VQ|5|Fits perfectly and the color is beautiful.
B00CN5PX8Y|2|It says it fits most but I don't think that's true. I am 5'3&#34; and wear medium; the length was shorter than expected and the elastic around the arms was tighter than desired. I returned it.
B0094VLG6S|5|worked great a spiced up the romance for my husband and I.  Thanks
B00JTUEWRO|3|small
B00ENAGJ4E|2|I received this dress as a gift off of my wishlist. I looked at it, and realized this was a completely different dress than the dress pictured above. The dress I received had large black and grey stripes with slim white stripes in lieu of the pictured elegant black and white stripes. I then examined the description of the dress and realized that the description matched the dress I received: &#34;Color: Black/Cream/Grey Melange&#34; & &#34;3/4 sleeves&#34; vs what is pictured: color: black/cream & full length sleeves. Please don't buy this dress if you expect to receive what is pictured.
B00JIJVEQ8|5|Nothing bad to say! I love them and you do need to order a couple sizes bigger if you like loosely fit tops. Looks great with leggings and jeans
B00LX9B83K|4|Love the purse and wallet, the catch on the wallet doesn't always work but overall a good product.
B00K668IJ8|3|I bought it because it was on sale. It looks better in the picture then up close. The fabric isn't great.
B001QF5Z3A|5|Bought two of these for my son and a friend,they went Braveheart on campus party, looked really good - fun costume.
B00MWTQQJG|4|very nice quality dress and fabric.  I like it that the lining had stretch to it like the fabric of the dress.  I have tried several JNY dresses and they fit a proportionate figure well.  However, this one runs large on me - normally wear an 8 or usually a 10, and the 10 is too loose.  I would have kept it & altered it or tried the next size down, except that i'm looking for a dress to wear under jackets, and the asymmetrical neckline doesn't look right (to me) under a jacket.  But i like the dress very well.
B0051D8MTM|4|I have been buying the Lee's Classic Fit jeans for years, but will not buy them again.  The fabric in those jeans has become too stretchy in my opinion, and I feel like I'm swimming in them after just a few hours.  However, the Relaxed Fit jeans are less stretchy and hold their shape much better.  They are a little looser in the legs than I would like, but at least they are the same jeans when I take them off as when I put them on!  I will continue to buy these jeans (if they don't change them which all jeans makers seem to do too often these days).
B00B7R4IEY|2|I'm spoiled as my sister, who lives in Spain, brings me genuine Spanish fans.  This rust colored fan is identical to a dark green one she last brought.  It is strong, and with the cutout holes, will wave easily in the air. This fan opens and shuts very easily.  As always, the weakest part will be the axle at the bottom holding the blades together.  The color (rust) is nicely feathered from darker on the outside blades to lighter rust toward the center.  Both sides are painted rust and both sides have the floral decoration.  The color truly is rust, a coppery brown. I'm looking forward to buying another one of the \\"14\\" colors when more colors than the two shown are offered.<br /><br />Update: Sigh...the axle at the bottom \\"hinge\\" broke after only 6 weeks.  I really liked this fan and wanted it to last... I wish I could buy the little axles.
B00IDNVHV2|5|Fit true to size and very good quality!  Also got very fast service from the seller and was overall very pleased.
B0047CC0GO|1|what size is this? it doesnt state anything in the description? besides it being womans small. Can anyone help? thanks! Stephanie
B00CN6OVTK|5|My husband loves these pants and he looks great in them. He likes the give in the waist when he sits at his desk, but goes back to normal when he is standing and walking.  I will be ordering more in different colors.
B00C1PGC04|3|When attached, it only pinches the tie at the tip of the clip so it has a tendency to droop on the outside and not stay straight. I flattened the whole thing out so that it pinches more evenly along the back of the tie which helped, but it felt like I was stressing the metal near to it's breaking point to do so.
B005QR7W08|5|These are nice and light and non-slip soles so my 3yo niece will be safe walking in them as I'm sure she will be wearing them all winter long because she's totally in love with Shamu.  That will be one happy child on Christmas morning!
B0084Y99MO|5|Nice when people respond with what AGE a particular size fits. This shirt goes<br />along with his love of Curious George Books and His Curious George Doll 'pal'
B000F3006Q|1|I got these boot tops as part of a super hero costume I made for Halloween and was very excited when I found them - they were exactly what I was looking for.  They turned out to be a real disappointment.  The upper edge of both boot tops ripped the first time I tried them on because they're shoddily made.  They're very hot to wear, they slide down your legs constantly (I was wearing tights, but I tried them on without tights and they did the same thing), and they smell so strongly of vinyl it's almost sickening.  By the time I finished wearing them at the one Halloween party I went to, I had to throw them in the trash because they were ripped so badly they looked completely stupid.  These weren't cheap, so I don't think it was asking too much to expect them to last through more than one party.  You'd be better off just wrapping ribbons around your legs instead of buying this product.  I wouldn't recommend it to anyone.
B00PBLOMMU|5|I GIVE IT A 5 because I am a size Misses 6 (36D bust) and ordered an X-Large because of the reviews stating it runs small.  I think the Lg would have fit me snug around the waist and bust.  I STILL LOVE IT.  I figure one I put more clothing underneath it will fit like I want.<br /><br />If I order again I will get the Lg.<br />The only draw back is how long it took for me to receive it.
B00QHUXCFW|1|not what we expected
B00DB5NNVE|5|If you are lacking a backside these are for you!
B000UGN1CS|5|After struggling with my Nike+ sensor for months, I was ready to do something drastic to my new shoes with velcro.  Then I found this Shoe Pouch and it's the best!  It fastens onto my shoelaces and holds the sensor securely.  I was worried about moving the sensor between pairs of shoes, but I ordered two Shoe Pouches and it's easy to move the sensor back and forth.  No more worrying about losing my sensor or feeling it rubbing my foot!
B008WZC13Y|2|It looks nothing like it does online. I'm surprised because I usually like the Allegra K brand. This was not a hit, definitely a miss!
B002YYZB3Q|4|The Pashmina shawl is a nice size and the color looks really close with the one in the picture maybe just a touch more purple hue in the blue.
B003V4AKFM|3|Out of the box, the stretch is uneven. On one side, it was elongated, and on the other side it was elastic. Hence the belt won't hang straight. In fact, due to the uneven tension between both sides, the belt looks like a pretzel. I returned it and had Amazon ship me another one. Will see if the replacement is better.<br /><br />I received a replacement from Amazon. This one is perfect. That's why I order from Amazon because they safeguard the customer. Unfortunately there is no points for Amazon, otherwise I would have given them 5 stars, and a one star for the Dockers belt for letting this kind of defect out to the market.
B00SU33BMS|3|as expected
B001U88OAE|1|I agree with another reviewer.Quality changed this year.  Fabric too thin. They are not tight anymore.[[ASIN:B001U88OAE Danskin Women's Supplex Capri]]
B002FB0TD0|5|Fast delivery and good condition!  Fits well and looks great- despite being a men's hat!  Perfect for days when the ends of my hair looks great but the top is not cooperating.
B003ICBH9K|5|I wanted to have fun matching costumes this year, so I purchased the jumpsuit for me and the dress for my wife, the costumes fit perfectly and the quality is great for the price, My wife is very pleased with her costume and she didnt have to set foot in the busy costume store! its nice when the picture in the add and on the package are the same as whats in the inside.....
B0026NQ6NO|3|a little small. it doesn't cover your neck good enough, but definitely keeps your face warm. good for kids, woman, or scarf wearers.....\\"about\\"an inch and a half shorter than pictured
B005CHW4K0|4|This was a replacement for identical product that was 10+ years old and showing signs of wear and tear.
B00FAX3ZB8|5|I've lost weight recently and haven't been able to find pants to fit. I ordered the NYDJ  crop in desperation.  Could I really expect to get a ;proper fit online?  I DID. i am so happy with this item I will probably try again.
B006DWABXA|5|This is a very nice wig! The color is a tiny bit lighter than in the picture but that was fine for me. I'm using the wig for Hunny from Ouran High School Host Club cosplay. It came about 2 1/2 weeks after I ordered it, which is a little over a week earlier than the estimated delivery date. It's not a very soft wig so if you only like soft ones, this one probably isn't for you. It definitely looks realistic though! I sent a picture of my self in the wig to a few friends and they thought it was real. All in all, this is a great wig that I recommend!
B000LUXZPG|2|off size - too short in the crotch
B00FGO3IJU|2|Jeans were too small, fitted like 2 sizes smaller
B00E9W9G96|5|Good quality shirt, description accurate, go for it!
B00E6JRRKW|5|Grat
B00IIXP9TS|4|This short is what I was looking for and want but unfortunately, it was too large. But other than that, the shirt is fine
B003AU5WBY|4|A decent t-shirt but not of the quality that I was hoping for, especially since as a long sleeve it is a top shirt rather than an undershirt.
B00K6X6RM6|3|Definitely not us sizes! I ordered 2 times bigger and is still a bit snug in the shoulder & chest. Looks super cute but the fabric is delicate so I think I'll hand wash this top.
B004ILOIXC|5|I love this swimsuit! For a woman with smaller headlights but a trailer that could require a wide load caution tape, this tankini is making the boys put on their air brakes while passing by. The H top keeps the girls in their proper place while the wider material below the empire waist gives the jelly belly some giggle room. The skirt is not form fitting so no panty line peeks or baby roll fat sacks show. At a healthy size 15, I nearly bought a 16, but being only slightly fluffy on top, I feared the neckline would reach my belly button so I opted for the 14. Fit like a charm.
B00L2RNIR2|4|Son loved the shirt but was a little too large. I think his biggest issue was too long (and he is tall), because he likes to leave unbuttoned so rest being little he could dealt with. He waited too late for me to return plus I don't think they have a size smaller than small. So if you can might want to buy a size smaller than you normally would.
B00C9VZBKW|5|I just received this item and love it. As a woman in her late 30's there are parts of my legs that I am having trouble with concealing. Especially when wearing a fitting dress.  This helped me and I feel confident and ready to wear that dress that's in my closet.  Thank you!
B0045VSHU0|5|Was perfect gift for my favorite Trekkie!
B00NE7FYIE|2|stitching came apart after 3 wearings.  Same happened to the mittens I bought for my other daughter and they will not take them back (after 30 days old).  Do not waste your money
B00HU0XLA4|4|The swim shirt is great and is the perfect size, but the shorts won't fit over her swim diaper.  We just let her run around without the shorts.
B00MVMT3YO|5|Beautiful
B008F4GQV0|4|My girls will be happy Christmas morning great price and quality. Pretty colors. They have wanted one of these for months. Thanks
B002ABO40E|2|The top feel like it is 60% of the thickness of my Landau tops.  The top isnt bad.. The pants are terrible and why I wont buy these again.  They are probably 1/2 as thin as Landau, I assumed that regular pant pockets were standard and these only had the 1 side and 1 back as extras.. but these pants literally have.. 1 side pocket and 1 back pocket... useless for a nurse.<br />The pants waist band is large..  I am 5'11\\" 140ibs and small fit.. but I have that drawstring all the way.  The drawstring is cheap too.. I couldn't get the knot undone to remove them just now after testing.. they are worse than my hospitals OR scrubs.<br />All in all the shirt gets 3.5/5 stars and the pants 1/5..  Im averaging it down to 2 since you have to buy them together.
B00FZVVJE0|5|I bought this for my son because he recently bought some &#34;name brand&#34; sweaters and it was such a great departure from t-shirts I thought I'd get him another. It is lightweight fine gauge cotton perfect for spring and sure looks nice.
B006MJ7Y48|5|If you don't have any Alternative tank tops, you need to try one. I didn't think cotton could be this soft; however, this tank never really fit me right.  My wife uses it over a sports-bra now, like the kids do.
B004RSYNFE|5|it is a little low cut for my taste but a simple under shirt fixes that problem and it is so cute! Great for any casual Occasion.
B00GTFY0FQ|5|As you see from the picture, this product is great if you have 3 identical legs.  (as I do, heh. heh. heh.)  But for real, I have three legs.
B0040GKNO8|4|These are really cute socks and I love them. Though I think the cost is a little high for what you get. You get 4 packs of thin socks. I would have liked them to be thicker. All and All I'm pretty pleased with my cute Hello Kitty socks.
B00K7UXL5Y|5|Great fit. Awesome feel.
B0077G77OW|5|I reviewd the other cut for this dress.  Both were surprising nice quality.  The lace was very pretty and the dress comfortable.  Very cute dress for a young lady.  Came in very quickly and was excited to try it on.  I realized I was an old woman and it didn't look so cute on me!  I returned it missing my youth.
B00DT4QNBO|4|The sizing for these said 2XX.  The waist is adjustable and I would say they would be snug for a size 44 person and quite large for a size 40.  The legs are long, I'm guessing 33 to 34 but have drawstrings so my 30 inseam was accommodated.  Lightweight material is great for early season and roomy enough to add layers for late autumn.  I would have given a 5 star if the inseam was just a bit shorter.
B005Z6HEVC|5|Fit very nice!
B005W18AHW|5|well made, soft, and folds small enough to not be uncomfortable when placed in the back pocket.  The double sided license holder is a great touch, giving me easy display of my drivers license and another card.
B00JAM5MZC|2|One size does not fit most. If you have a little weight on you, these will ride up constantly. I gave them to my daughter.
B00H7VIV60|5|This is one of the cutest shirts. My 9 year old loves it. The yellow is a nice bright contrast to the navy blue.
B00EH98V42|5|PERFECT FIT
B00F8AGAA6|4|Both belts are well made and the price was very good. I needed a few belts and these fit the bill. I liked the style and the price. As always. it came within the usual 2 days of Amazon Prime.
B00GCEQTKS|5|After reading reviews about other men wearing Vanity Fair panties thought I would try a few pairs. They fit better then mens nylon bikini underwear. I was glad I  could buy them on Amazon with out any problem.  P.S. Also the wife likes them for herself and now for me.
B00LMKRZFA|5|love them
B00OBAZ2E4|5|Well designed, well made, and comfortable.
B00O6M1IX6|5|Very soft and comfortable.Highly recommend
B00GTINKTK|3|Shorts were fine, nice material, print was as pictured, but way too big for my skinny kid and not adjustable.
B00JC3KZHO|2|no rmb
B00I9JGSJQ|5|This is the cutest little outfit ever! My daughter looks super cute in it and it is well made.
B00AP8E2YW|5|I love this hat!
B007JAA6K8|5|The onesie is soft and comfortable, perfect Halloween costume for a 1 month old baby. Not sure that it would fit an older baby, our is only 23 inches long and it was snug on him. It would need to be longer to accommodate longer/taller babies.
B00CHS7THK|5|I ordered a size small with a little hesitation because of other comments about fit. I was relieved when it fit perfectly, I'm  5'5&#34; and weigh 124 lbs.The band of 1&#34; elastic has just the right amount of give at the waist and makes for a flattering fit. The maxi-length was just right with no fear of tripping over the hem. Looks great with sandals. I received lots of complements on the dress...very pleased.
B00E1OBI3O|5|I really like these, they are very cute! I expected these to be snug, and they are, but not in a bad way. I'm pretty small, size 0 pants fit, but I usually go for size 3 because I like them loose. If you're any bigger than that, I wouldn't suggest buying these, because while the panty stretches, the butterfly in back does not.
B000N8TKNC|5|These are very durable and practical jeans. They fit very well.<br /><br />I got these for my guy in size 34x34, he is 6'0'' and 190 lbs and they were exactly his size. I especially like the fact that you can choose the length you like because sometimes finding 34x34 inn stores can be difficult.<br /><br />I'd say that these jeans offer a great value in terms of quality to price ratio!
B009EU55RU|5|Love the shirt.  Runs small. I usually wear a medium and had to get a large.  I'm 5'10&#34; and weigh 170.
B00KOJGVHI|5|Haven't had a flannel shirt for years but this one is a gem. It is light, easy to look at and fits the bill over a shirt and jeans....nice and very well made.
B003H8LNAI|5|I really like the chin strap; seems like (especially wide brim) hats want to blow off your head even in gentle breezes. Brim is perfect size. Inner band is comfy. I work on a campus so walk between buildings a lot. This is the perfect hat to block the sun.
B00L7U5Z2K|5|really like, just what l was looking for.
B008VIMO4I|5|These tights are so very cute, but I guess I didn't realize they would be completely see through...even though it should've been more than obvious by the picture!  Not exactly ideal for the yoga classes I attend without something on underneath, however I still love them!  They are very well made, came in a very quick manner especially considering they are hand made to order!
B00IPXLSUU|4|Great experience!  Cute skirt for the price.  Fits shape snug.
B00DUJSYME|5|What a great idea!  You get a really nice buckle and a top quality belt.  You cut the belt to exactly the size you need and then attach the belt to the buckle.  Great packaging as well!  The only surprise was the weight of the buckle.  It is a little heavy.  That being said, I really recommend this product.
B00HM42GMW|5|nice
B001OA8YZS|5|thanks
B00HRP62IU|5|love von dutch
B0063TUIB8|4|I wore this dress for my wedding back in 2012. I am petite and short (5'3\\", 110 lbs) so I got an extra small only to discover that I needed to alter it because it was still too big (taken in at the sides to become more fitting)! But after alterations, it fit beautifully and I had a great wedding!
B006CS7RMI|5|The tank top was just what I expected, the material felt good, it's a great workout shirt if you want to flaunt your muscles. I received it in a very timely manner, I would do business with this seller again.
B00CIPJV4Q|5|I bought two of these bracelets as part of a costume, it fit my wrist great. I have big hands for a woman and this was perfect. It made my outfit. I have recommended these to my friends that like different jewelry to ordinary outfits look better.
B0083G9KZO|5|Is an excellent jacket the fit as expected and the material is excelent. Good seller all was so quickly I recomended it
B00B4Z5CK8|5|This is a well made wallet with plenty of holders for credit & business cards. Made of a good quality leather & should last for a long time.
B00LU0SOXO|4|This runs really big. Order your normal size
B00N3S7IQA|5|So cute. Can't wait for my little one to wear it.
B00UYNHXVC|5|Beautiful fabric quality. Fits as expected. Quick shipping!
B004RQ5TCW|5|It is a quality item and arrived as described and quickly.  This was actually for a teenager so I got the largest I could and it worked out fine. The recipient loved it.
B00IZ6IIZ0|5|These tags were exactly as described, packed very well and should last us a lifetime.
B00ACIGVJ4|5|I bought these for my boyfriend and we'll he loves them he's always been a Hanes guy and this fit him perfect and are a really good lengths on him
B007AFUXXW|5|This hat is so cute with the tuft of green hair and the evil eyes.  I very much like that the hat is easily recognizable as The Grinch without requiring one to wear a mask.<br /><br />Great fun!
B00K1KZ7X4|5|This belt is clearly not real silver, but it the material is not cheap.  It will last for a while because the links are thick and the clasp is sturdy.  The shine on the belt is really nice, too.  I plan to use it with a long, sheer, clingy slip dress - very rock and roll.
B00ADJE7KC|4|I purchased this for my son and he loves it.
B00ID6PPSU|2|When I received the sweater every piece was discolored and there were stains on it. It was also a bigger size. I did contact the company and they were slow getting back to me. They offered to exchange the item but I had to pay for return shipping from the US to the UK. I wasn't willing to spend $15+ dollars on and item ive already paid too much for. I just kept. I dyed and dried it a lot and it works. Also the material was very cheap.
B00AHTK4VY|4|Slightly smaller than expected, but gives me great support for runs or cardio work outs. Very happy with this product.
B00N65VBOU|5|Love the color and the comfort.  Joy
B00827RSVW|5|Just perfect
B00FB1SJJW|4|its an anniversary gift for my husband.  he liked it just fine.
B00HNVF4NW|3|Jacket is a little tight and pants are mgood
B00BTVNIH6|5|My sister and her 5 YO daughter were thrilled with these socks. They are very well made, and super cute. I have to say, I almost didn't give them away as a gift, because they were so cute, and I'm not even officially a My Little Pony fan!<br /><br />They even keep their bright colors after a few washings.
B00E7O01CW|4|The shirts were a weird feeling material that i wasn't expecting, still cute, just not what i was hoping for
B00S44STBG|5|:)
B0002TOZ1O|1|junk, heal wore out very fast!
B008A4BHCS|5|I cannot bellive how amazing this is. I orginally had bought the pistol as a side arm 2 my tippman 98. However when i saw that my much wealthier friend had bout a Kingmen Eraser i knew it was serious. So i searched and searched for days for a decent pistol. Then i came across this amazing product. I had known tippman for their amazing gus so i looked into this product and couldn't believe what i had found. Needles to say i was convinced to buy it. My first game with it my 98 ran out of paint so i switched wepons and dominated. The feild was a urban enviroment so i rushed into the closest building and immeadetly dropped 2 oppennets. Then i rushed out and dropped another 2. after that i skulked around and found the last player and got him with a headshot.
B00G3IN3DO|3|I would have rated these higher except the button for the fly is too small and they keep letting in a breeze :)  The fabric and construction is nice though.
B00L36GWZ2|5|Loved how soft it felt.
B009RHI7RA|1|Just got this tie, it is not long, it is about 58&#34;, not 63&#34; as advertised. Looking at reviews of this companies other ties it seems that this is universal deceit on all their tall ties.
B00DE8QH8Y|5|Fit good
B00C9AJ5ZK|5|This blouse is comfortable and beautiful. I love it very much. I gave it a five star rating because of that and it fits just right. I would definitely recommend this blouse to others.
B001TZCLSE|5|This crusher hat is made to travel. It truly crushes down to nothing then looks great with just a fluff. The hat blocks the sun, looks great, and fits well as the tie on the band is adjustable. I was hesitant to pay this price as I am not a hat person and was afraid that I would let it sit in the closet. Instead, I wear it daily. It is a fun hat to wear, does not hold heat in, and so good for your skin!
B00DJ1EBUC|5|good item
B002JQ5K1M|4|This tan is soo dark its almost a light purple. Works for what I need tho. Thanks! No issues with the fabric or size, it fits great.
B00QXVLY7I|5|I am obsessed with this pair of pants!!!! They are the perfect pants for every occasion.  You can dress the pants up for a fun night out or you can simply throw them on for running errands while looking chic!  I love these pants because they are so comfortable.  These pants are an awesome combination of comfort and style.  I will definitely be ordering more of these pants!!!!
B005Q0JLGS|4|The colors on the shirt are as vibrant in person as it appears on the computer screen. Sizing is a defiant issue though. The shirt is a body skimming fit, which essentially means awkward of your measurements aren't textbook. I ordered a small and it fits in the waist, but is a tighter across the chest than I like. I tried sizing up only to find that it fits the bust, but I'm swimming in it in the waist. I decided to keep the small, but I'm defiantly not going to be able to put it in the dryer.
B0042D1DES|5|I love this shirt. It's a great fan shirt for Iron Man fans. Plus I like the Triangular Chest piece! I only wish it came in bigger sizes...
B0032GBTDG|5|LOVE these,now let me tell you why,these are very bright but not obscenely bright,very nicely made and the colors blend very well,these were bought for our teenage daughter,who adores suspenders,but they would be fine for a guy also,they came in very fast,a great buy,WILL order from again,exactly as described,no surprises,except how much i would like these,may end up keeping them myself,nope can't do that,may have to order my self some.
B0020HRYYG|5|These are nice sicks and fit the person I gave them to perfectly.  I would recommend them.  I think they are good socks.
B00NXJ7300|1|I was really disappointed in not only the sizing, but that the trim is PLASTIC! The fabric was of inferior quality. Need to return it!
B0006JAU3W|2|In your description it said the material was fleece that's not true it is knit. When I received it I was looking for fleece. Did you know that this type of knit shrinks when you wash it and fleece does not. Maybe I can find someone to give it to. I'm too upset to even try it on. I just don't want to go through the hassle of sending it back with shipping fees that I have to pay.
B003SGE8TW|5|Really nice shirt & fits great
B00JL8XHA2|4|Beautiful dress
B005L9ZMYE|5|I got the largest size and it fits me just right heightwise 6'3\\".  if youre taller ur out of luck i think.  i searched amazon & web -these were largest i could find.  For me though: perfect.  extremely comfy-wonderful insulation on cold nights.  pleasant.  my daughters are tickled seeing me in it.  had it 1 month so far-no wear or tear.
B007A7PQZ0|5|Bought this for my dad for Christmas. He's a retired SCPO and he absolutely LOVES it. Great details in the embroidery on the hat. So glad we decided on it. Made my old salty dad very happy.
B00QQ3CF3K|4|Got the dress for an elementary school graduation. It looks very nice, just that it's a bit small for its size but nothing that can't be managed.
B002QJ825I|5|Started using this bra when I went back to work and had to pump, fits great, gives great support, and is easy to clip and unclip.  Will use again when I have another nursing baby
B00CRMM6V0|1|First off, the belt has a white backing to it.  This shows when wearing it.  Secondly, Belts.com charges a 20% restocking fee and I had to pay for shipping.  As a result, I received a little over half my money back.  Make sure you love this belt before you buy it because if you don't you will lose money.
B005TA8NSC|4|Did not use often before being out grown.
B008RTSNX2|5|Very warm, great fit and exactly the great quality I expected.  Must have for German winters a and shipped quickly.
B00719YZZ4|1|Russell Cotton Performance tees have been discontinued. I tried the Russell Men's Dri-Power 360 performance tee. The Dri-Power 360 is a failure. The fit is poor, the neck stretches and falls away from my neck. The fabric is to light for my likes. Totally unhappy.
B002ETVM0W|5|Good quality
B00CIVFJEQ|5|my absolute favorite thing about this hoodie is the quality of the design. it isnt just some plastic-y stuff on top of the fabric that would break apart after being stretched a few times. the design is IN the fabric, so the only way the image would get messed up is from fading over time. and when b.m.c. said the seams were durable, they werent joking either! the stitching feels like itll hold very nicely. the only downside i could find is that the fabric is a bit thin. either way, im very very happy with my purchase. :>
B00IWRRDTE|5|What I was looking for
B00MBGVVOK|5|great
B00DWN7Z5A|5|Great product
B004S0KTZO|2|I bought a XXL in this peacoat and it was kinda flimsy.  The fit was okay not too puffy like some coats trying to fit everyone (big tummy guys) but at 6'5&#34; the sleeves, I need 37&#34; were to short and the jacket itself, as pictured, comes just to the crotch.  It is an updated look and I guess I wasn't ready for the update so I've sent it back.  Great shipping grreat company!
B00DVKNHU6|4|Very cute!  My 3-yeaar-old grandson loved them!  He's in the fifty percentile size and weight of children his age and I found a size 3T to &#34;fit&#34;...a 4T might have been a little better.  He especially loved the one with Mickey with his guitar!
B003ICF91W|5|If you want to have a look of a french can can style, don't hesitate to choose this costume. The size is as it is suppose to be. The color is beautiful. I am very happy of my purchase.
B00NI4WGUC|4|Cute, fits larger then the size chart made me expect.
B004IMG730|3|Well, it makes your bulge look kind've bigger , but you certaintly cannot make out the penis, and head outline in the cup, just looks like a bigger version of your own bulge. I personally think its nothing special
B004UUJMKU|5|looks and fits as described
B00B2JINEI|5|A beautiful dress but I ordered a large and the sleeves were too long -(I'm 5'6 and 130) A medium would have worked just fine. Great, vibrant summer dress. I'll probably exchange it for a medium.
B00ARY0S8I|4|Adorable
B00HR140QU|3|I have the 9/11 size on my size-10 feet.  The backs slip off when I am walking, rendering them useless for me.  Otherwise, the quality is exactly what I wanted.
B00L9E76OY|5|Very good dress. fast and accurate shhipping
B00AKFPOZQ|1|I bought this expecting it to be a full onesie like all of the others but I got it and it was just a cloak. Not at all what I wanted.
B0006I3TL8|5|excellent quality;; i will order one size down, e.g., a 6 instead of my usual size 7
B00BOCDGOK|5|My son loves wearing them. They are very soft and they wash very well. The hat is slightly smaller than I expected.
B00EZJDVBW|4|I really like this item, it was a good buy especially for the price. Amazon does it again. My favorite shopping site.
B007C2868W|3|My baby was born under 3lbs so these were big for her in the beginning.  By the time she was 5 lbs she was able to wear them.  They did not stay on baby's head, even though they fit.  Had to constantly be replacing them, so I wouldn't recommend it.
B008KCKA50|4|Shipped fast, fits well.
B00LVPMD6W|5|Great price, right product, fast shipping
B00HM9NOLO|5|I got this shirt for the world cup and wore it for the games.  I really liked the design and it fit well.
B000MXWR3I|5|Love the belt and it matches my shoes perfectly.
B0089ZUVAW|4|nice hat. a bit small for me. could offer 4 sizes as opposed to 2
B0009OTUJE|5|Very pleased with the product
B00A3Q0CLS|5|My 8 year old son was thrilled when he received this shirt. Good quality shirt that takes the rough and tough tumble of playing outside.
B0079MGQVY|3|very thin, very short, but I got them to wear under a skirt so they work fine for that.
B00HQRNV8I|5|I do love it, but I should have gotten a small instead of a medium.  It's hard to button at first, but the verry next week, I'm in my last row, and I need it to be smaller.  I'm going to try taking it to the cleaners and having it taken in.
B000GYSUOS|5|I received the Sylvester costume on time and it fit like a glove! I wore it  for halloween and had a great time. I got great comments on the costume. My wife   wore the Tweety costume.
B00WG6U4VG|4|Beautiful dress
B00570KF9E|5|Bought one for my other son and bought this cause the price was great they both love them and we get lots of compliments
B00ACIHBV6|5|Well made, comfortable, sturdy, fits well, wears well, washes well. No bagging, bunching or binding. Blends in well. Like these better than briefs
B0042RURAK|5|I loved this Cami with Bra, it does hide the back bulge and it actually gives you a nice lift.  The bottom does not roll up or anything. Wish they had it in White, but only comes in beige and black.  Its not thin or light, so I don't recommend wearing during the summer.  You can use the straps or without, the straps help with the lift.
B00FFCSA50|3|I went with XS but I still have to take it to the taylor. I guess I need a burger or two. The material and cut are very good quality. I cannot believe how cheap it was.
B0044MLQR6|5|Had my son's 3rd Birthday party Spiderman theme and we all had shirts to match the theme.  Everyone thought we looked cute.<br />Thanks Amazon!
B004HYN4TO|5|This wallet looks nice and appears to be genuine leather.  It has credit card slots just as shown in the picture.  It has survived for about a year thus far without much show of wear.  It is a very good value for the price.
B00JMQ9K4U|4|I was a little apprehensive about what size to order after reading other reviews.  I usually wear a small or medium and ordered a large.  A size med would have been fine but considering this is a loose style top the large is ok.  The bottom of the shirt is a little loose on my hips.  I am 5'8&#34; 145 lbs. chest 35 waist 28 and hips 36.  The material is a nice light blend which helps with the flow.  It is not overly see through and seems to be nicely made for the price.  Exactly as expected.
B0062C4BJ6|5|I love my fleece. I am a little skeptical about ordering garments online, but I was very satisfied with my purchased. My fleece gives me the protection I need from the cold and is not to heavy or bulky. Would I but this item again or reccomend to others, yes I surley would.
B000VW2QJA|5|Gives warmth and comfort!  Never thought it could give such satisfaction at a not so expensive price item.  Try it for yourself!
B00ITR8KHG|5|Good Product
B00MPO9GXQ|4|Qualitiful
B00OTLIJZY|5|Great update to a classic.
B00JSP44AU|4|Love the dress but runs a little big and is shorter than I would have liked it to be.
B00ZCIN1C4|5|Just got this and I'm obsessed! I'm a tad bit tall so it's kinda short but it's nothing a couple of safety pins won't fix. Was on the fence about ordering it because of the reviews but it turned out awesome for me.
B006W5VV4G|3|Bought this tee for an upcoming trip to Europe to wear as my 'tourist' top.  The material is soft (25% supima cotton and 25% modal) and comfortable so it's versatile enough for both cool and warm weather. Even though the shirt is 50% polyester, it came out wrinkly after washing it.  The V neck is flattering and is modest.  The blue and gray stripes are casual but I'm able to dress it up by throwing on a black tuxedo jacket or keep it casual with my capris.  I usually wear a size 6 and the medium was the right choice.  I only gave the tee a \\"3\\" because it's a little thinner than I would prefer.
B00PMIIES0|5|Fit perfectly!
B00MY0IVKA|4|Super cute and very warm onesie! I am 5'6, 160lbs, usually wear a 10-12 and ordered the Large and it fit well! My only issue is that I have a very long torso so it was just on the border of camel toe, but not quite! My other complaint is that the hoodie is so heavy it kinda tugs the top of the garmet back and I had to keep pulling it back in place. If you just want something cute to stay warm in then you got it!
B00D70EI5I|4|This are some cute socks that worked perfect for what I needed them for except that they rip was a little tight.
B008BUD2GU|5|These fit my 7 yr. old daughter with rather large size 2 feet perfectly. They looked great with her uniform and, most importantly, she loved them!
B00LFBIG5Y|4|Very very good
B008A4W50Q|3|So, I really thought these were going to fit great because of all the reviews. I am not impressed though.<br /><br />I am 5'7'', 190 lbs, hourglass shape. I purchased the size 14. The waist is fine and the length is fine. I just don't like how loose the crotch and thigh material is...the material bunches up.  Also, they make my butt look flat. I will wear them with a sweater or a jacket, something longer to hide the butt and crotch.<br /><br />I will not buy these again.
B000OWF996|5|I now have purchased three of these bras.  Best one I've ever worn.  Great support for all activities including running.
B001LNR1QG|1|This shirt arrived, I washed it, took it off, and threw it in the garbage.  The shirt is very short and baggy, except on your chest.  So, I would say if you have no chest and an enormous stomach, but do not want the stomach completely covered, this is the shirt for you, otherwise, do not waste your money.
B00GTMJOU0|4|Nice summery top fits well with or without tie
B001M0A31S|5|Its a great shirt for the casual fan and the dyed in the wool trekkie!  Why?  Because its a T-shirt first, that passes with a small star trek insignia (very well placed and done BTW) and not a realistic space age material...however, you the wearer know its a Star Trek Uniform first, and a T-shirt second!  :-)  I love mine and it sparks a lot of conversations, and who doesn't love talking about Star Trek?!
B00NSS3DYG|5|I like it
B0091KARB2|5|Love it
B00JDU7C54|5|Beautiful top.Looks great on me.
B002IW8UQE|5|Holds cards and id with room for insurance cards, pharmacy cards, grocery cards, etc with two slots in the back that holds cash or checks (not entire checkbook).  Beautiful leather with zipper to make sure none of the cards get lost.
B001V5V2UA|4|These run small. Leg length made for rolling up if desired. Hence 4, not 6 stars.<br /><br />These are  very lovely and well-made. But buy larger than you imagine. This style is made to be a little loose, and the size runs a bit small around waist and hips.  I'm buying another in a larger size.
B008661DE2|5|fits great.....good quality
B005RJ8U88|5|Surprisingly durable, looked great and VERY easy to put on.
B006TCJU2M|4|Nice quality, good work shirt. And when you know your size in carhartt you'll be even happier. That being said I feel that they run a bit large so order a size down.
B008D3AX12|2|Much cuter in picture.  Outfit looked awkward on our one month old.. Sleeves were long and bulky and pants were also larger.. Overall would not buy it again.
B003WMQJ8K|4|Nice feel to material but white is see through. A bit longer than expected--The photo is deceptive. I think the colored scrubs would be very nice.  They fit and drape nicely in the seat and legs.
B0055X1NTO|5|I liked this product. It is comfortable
B005PKOY0M|5|This a very basic dress, but because of the shape and color very nice !
B00J3ZJQ4E|4|He loves it and fits correctly
B008ASB7S8|5|Ordered these for our dance team. Worked out great.
B00DWN735M|5|Love these!!!!!
B005T4NQCQ|5|Just got my pair in this morning and I love them already. Its a light and warm material yet breathable at the same time. It is also extremely comfortable: when I put them on to make sure the size fits, I ended up wearing them for the next half hour because I really didn't want to take them off. A great price for a very comfortable pair of snowpants!
B00K5LZOXM|5|comfortable shirt. bought for work. light fabric. not itchy
B00BWIYW62|4|They fit pretty well, like that they come up higher however they do tend to slide down.  Overall happy w them.
B003JTI0LU|5|I am very pleased with the quality and fit.
B00S9NPPOG|5|Nice color. Comfortable lightweight hoody. Fits as expected.
B00NJP6U0C|5|Beautiful vest, I love it!
B00PY57B76|4|Nice but littil small to me if make order tack one more size
B0011MUKBA|3|The cups in this were smaller cups than my other regular bra which is 1 nominal cup and band size smaller.  Also forced my breasts outward so nipples did not point forwards.  Might work for women with a larger frame.
B001EH7452|5|My husband said he really liked them (comfortable & well-fitting).  They also washed well not needing ironing.
B00LQL18F8|4|I like this coat because the color, quality and fit are very nice.  We are experiencing unusually cold weather in Missouri right now, and I discovered that it not very warm.
B0029JHV34|5|The pants are fine but I really wanted the ones they use to make with the all around elastic waist they are much more comfortable which as being older is what I look for.
B00IPTZDK0|5|Love it.
B003MMKP1W|5|This buckle is absolutely gorgeous and is an exceptional bargain.  My grandaughter loves it and it looks beautiful on her belt.  This company packages their products so nicely for shipping and always comes in quickly.
B00IXFAE00|2|Really nice shirt. The fabric is stretchy and very soft. However, it did have the chemical smell when it arrived. Also, the shirt is not loose. It forms around your body. So if you want a loose fit, order much larger than you'd expect.
B002G9UEFY|5|Very warm hat. Great for stationary hunting.
B005C9GLZC|2|Both Hanes and Fruit of the Loom are doing this new design where there is 2 creases on the back to supposedly fit better. They are terribly uncomfortable and scrunch up whenever you sit down. I've been trying for 2 months to find the old style of boxers and I can't do it. All the big retailers only sell this new design now and I wish they'd go back. I can't find a comfortable pair of boxers anymore.
B00A3S41TA|5|Love this one!  So vibrant and pretty color blends....I'm hooked on scarves right now and the Libby Sue brand is quality.
B005H3B9YG|1|Started breaking right when I bought it.
B00S7ZTXO4|5|My niece loved it
B007BKGC4U|5|I love these socks!  The sock is just a bit higher than other crew socks so that it doesn't fall below the top of your shoe. Perfect and really comfortable. Very breathable.
B00SLPDXLE|5|I love this! The pattern is so cute and the fabric is lightweight so little one doesn't get overheated.<br /><br />The zipper is a lot quicker to get on and off than the snaps. Garment has held up nicely even after many washes.
B00HA2NV8O|3|Satisfied
B0042LI3Y8|4|I love this hat, I wear it all the time. I'm going to order more in different colors.
B0009MZWF2|5|my dress shoes are incredibly stiff and painful to walk in...except when i wear these socks!
B00D3LQ4XU|1|does not come in small
B00HDPIEMQ|3|Stating that this bra runs large, so I ordered a smaller cup size when I foolishly should have ordered a smaller size overall (38GG to a 36G). Instead I went down to a 38G so this was really big on me and made my boobs do the whole &#34;east-west&#34; look. The material is also REALLY stretchy so even if you order it too tight, I can see it stretching to fit you. But it is a super pretty bra. At this price its worth getting.
B008AHLG30|5|It's a beautiful sweater!  I love the ruffle!  Pure Knit sweaters are beautifully crafted and are unique.  I have several and love each one.
B00GTQ045U|2|Had to return,too large.😕
B00C0PDUR8|4|My son LOVES this sword. Other descriptions of looks are spot on. It is a bit big but I don't care. My son LOVES it!
B002R0F8L2|4|No breaks or rips and its been a month
B002R0FE52|2|This is a nice Leotard, but I wonder about how it was sized.  The extra large was too small for my child who normally wears that size. She couldn't even get it pulled all the way up.  Not sure if it was &#34;true to size&#34;.
B00KIBZ362|5|The dress fits perfect. I was able to send the exact measurement by email. The length is a bit long but that's ok. Easy to fix. Material is silk and very rich in color. I was a bit concern that it may not have arrived but it did under two weeks. I look to wearing it.
B009VJAYDO|5|These are great.  They a comfortable and I love the colors.
B0038OMDXM|5|I know that Gerber runs small, so I ordered a size up and it fits great.  Exactly what we needed for him to wear under dress shirts.
B000P34FBW|5|I got it as a Christmas gift and I was satisfied. It is what you expect, soft, fuzzy, and a durable grey color.
B00IHTQCBW|5|SIMPLY AN AWESOME PRODUCT.<br />I have received it in a few days---about 2 weeks so i will buy it again...if i want to buy usa's products...i know where i have to go...xd<br />THANKS A LOT<br />Matteo Lucaccini from Florence,Italy
B0011J0BGW|4|Loved the way that this bra fits, only wish that it had longer straps. The rings cut into my shoulder blades a little, but with some wearing  they seen to stretch some and stop. They support well and by hooking the straps in the back, it increases the support. Would buy more.
B00RCM4N16|4|Love it!
B00504652I|4|I have long arms, I were a 38/39 dress shirt, so finding long sleeve shirt that fit is difficult.  The sleeves are just a bit short and will likely shrink slightly after the first wash.  Other than that, the fit is good and I like the shirt.
B00CKXA1D6|5|Love this top and have already ordered 3 different colors.  It's extremely snug.  I normally wear a medium (from Target/Loft/Talbots), but ordered a large and it is very snug.  If you don't like it skin tight, order two sizes up.  Anyway you prefer, the top is cut very well and you will like it - just order a size or two larger depending on your preference.
B00BTKO5II|5|I bought the beard beanie as a gift for my grandson, he really liked and said it was just what he expected.  It is warm and comfortable.
B00GOQ109O|5|Very good quality, the shirt is exactly as it is on the picture ! I would have chosen the wrong size without your guiding about the measuring. And here i would like to tell everybody to be careful about the size.<br />i would suggest you to take a measure when you choosing the size. it just take a few mins and you got a perfect shirt which fit you like a glove.
B0006MZHUA|5|Old brand, you can buy any model with close eye and will fit as have to. Happy to have them
B007I7560W|3|I ordered the 6 to 12 month size of this onesie and my 4 month old was barely able to wear it once before it was too small, and he's only about 80th percentile in size.  The arm openings are way too tight, it doesn't stretch, and the plastic snaps are difficult to use and don't hold as well as metal snaps.  I'd say the 6 to 12 month size fits like a carters 3 to 6, but the arms are a bit tighter.<br /><br />Still, if your baby is the right size, the material itself is okay, and you can't get much cuter than Angry Birds.
B008FQT6EM|4|it was perfect for my son's Halloween costume
B00MWGP758|5|Fits well. Nice and warm
B00146B7V0|4|These wings look great, appear to be of good quality, and the large ones are really large! My only complaint is that the \\"pin backs\\" are plastic, they don`t stay on, and poke through to hurt your fingers. It would be better to charge a little more and provide quality \\"pin backs\\" I have only worn them once because I am afraid of losing them.
B00V7RBO5A|5|Everything good!
B00T2X9MJQ|4|This set was purchased for a birthday present for a six year old girl who has new doll baby.  It was an instant hit with her and fit her well.  I took others' suggestions and bought a size up because many commented that it ran small. This seems to be true. The little lady in question is on the petite side and going a size up fit her well. I can't say what it would be like on a more average size child.  Speaking of size, the doll outfit says it is intended for 18&#34; dolls.  The doll who now wears it is 14&#34; and the outfit looks just fine.  The style of the dress is cute, but be aware that the ruffles do not continue in back; the back is an A line fit of the white with black polka dots.  I do love the detail of the bow on the back of the girl's dress-a nice touch.  The doll's dress does not have the same detail, but it does not need it. The shorts are very stretchy and looked a bit big out of the box, but actually fit very well when on and were a good length.  Construction was about what you would expect for the price.  I would not expect the outfit to last much more than a season or two, but children don't usually need them to last longer than that. This gift was a winner in the birthday girl's book!
B00YVN82CK|5|love it
B005CJMG8I|5|Material feels sturdier compared to other Dockers' D3 that I have. Maybe several washes will make them feel softer over time. Like how they fit, legs are not tight to the skin, the sitting section feels just right and the front is not uncomfortable, even while sitting. The only thing I did not like is the front right pocket has the smaller key/coin pocket sewn too far out of the pocket, maybe it is just the pants style. Anyway, pants are the right price and the right fit. I'm 5'5&#34; with 30/30
B00AKSCMZ8|5|These shorts are nice. I use them as underware to avoid chafing while hiking.
B005KSIS42|3|Good quality leather, though not what I had envisioned.
B00GJG91RM|5|I love this skirt!! the fabric is stretchy and the elastic band fits amazingly. I'm 5'3 and 115 pounds with the waist size of 27 1/2&#34;  it fits perfect!!! It goes with just about anything and when you spin it twirls out completely! it's so cute! i recommend it especially for the price.
B002RAS4Y0|5|This is a beautiful, lightweight scarf.  I bought it for my niece for Christmas and it didn't get here on time, so I'm keeping it for myself.  Nice fabric texture, beautiful fringe.  Can't beat the price, either.
B000MXQ1QW|4|My husband really liked these pants.
B0044MD4R6|5|Very nice quality, very soft, snuggly warm, great value, fast shipping, lovely saturated colors just as shown.    Very happy with this purchase.
B001461P9O|4|great color ...mmm  ,nice fit . just what I was looking for. blah blah, blah I recommend it. to you
B00551PYV4|5|This is now my everyday bra.  Comfortable and soft, yet provides great support.  The price makes it affordable to buy several at a time.  Will buy these again when I want more.
B00M3GOQEA|1|I ordered a size larger than I normally would wear and they were still two tight.
B00D8JSA6Q|2|Bought the meduim (normally wear a S or 6). These panties are made out of a nylon material and really don't stretch enough to accomodate everything. The crotch is also pretty narrow too. Even when cutting out the cotton gusset, they really don't work for us.
B00ET1V3UC|4|I can see why guys like these, lol... they are very comfortable, as long as you're not trying to put on tight jeans over them. My only wish would be that they were just a little thicker, or 'sturdier', I suppose. I expected this, though, and I am happy with them.
B003E293ZY|4|They pants were fine, but the color was lighter than what the picture looked like. I sent them back for a refund.
B003Z5B3B2|5|These pale blue pants are comfortable and easy to move around in, for a young child.
B0083QFE0Y|4|I love this dress. It fits perfectly and the color is exactly right for my pale German skin. I bought it in the summer and wore it often and then in the fall paired it with a light cardigan. Will be able to do the same in the spring so this is a dress I will get  lot of wear out of. Great dress...
B004PNWEO8|4|Nice hunter green color and pretty slim fit. Definitely not too puffy. The colar is a little on the talk side but my husband said it should be ok. Especially once washed and relaxed a littl.
B001JI59N0|5|very nice, a gift for my daughter and she wears it all the time. Right in fashion !
B0026URFVO|3|I brought this bra with me to the hospital (I bought it before I had the baby), but it just didn't fit right. There's a thick support seam under the pits  that was just uncomfortable! I don't use it, and ended up buying an ameda bra at a local store.
B00QKHWJWY|1|too much room in the top
B00W2D8KUK|1|They were to small i couldnt fit one leg in them and im tired of getting stuff thats wrong I will probably never shop for close or cases because of this
B00HESRGQ2|4|Warm, good length drapes well.
B005EN4FW2|5|Ask people who know me well what my favorite things are, and they will probably say POCKETS. I've more than once been termed a turtle or pack mule. If someone needs to borrow a nail clipper, magnetic tool grabber, flashlight or safety pin, they ask me. I just love to have my stuff with me at all times! :)<br /><br />This is my favorite hoodie now. I used to wear a photojournalist vest (very bulky looking) and/or a fanny pack. Now the hoodie is all I need! Because it's made of fleece, it is so warm I didn't need a jacket when it got cold out the other day!<br /><br />When I win the lottery or Publishers Clearing House, I will purchase a complete outfit of SeV's products -- shirt, hooded jacket that turns into a vest, and convertible cargo pants. Then I won't need a bag at all! Best of all, the items go on sale pretty often!<br /><br />Go check out the website. It's amazing! [...]
B00AY0JOGM|4|I love their designs, but the shirts are always a bit on the long side.
B00JQ292JS|4|Great dress
B00K920X7O|5|Great gift
B00BXX3GWW|5|Please make more colors.  Love the gloves. I need more colors - like reds,green,yellow, etc.I I love the softness and quality  of the leather
B002WJF84K|5|Exactly what I wanted. Thanjs
B000BIGSFM|4|Works as described
B001ECR42A|3|OK so these are cuter in the photo than they are when on the baby, but that's not such a big deal.  I do hate that on the side of each sock is printed, very visibly, \\"B & M\\"  as in BM=Bowel Movement.  Eeeww.<br /><br />Also they are just thin nylon socks, so don't expect them to actually keep a baby's feet warm...just good for a buffer under shoes I guess...in which case you could not see the design on the sock anyway.
B006H7XMVY|5|It looks just like the picture and I the right size. I am glad that it is for a right shoulder because after some research I found that Military has the flag on the left and civilians on the right. And the flag is always to have the pole side of the flag facing so it brakes the wind as you walk forward. The reason the Military wears the flag on the left is because soldiers are more likely to loose there right arm in combat than there left. Civilians wear it on the right so that when you cover your heart the flag is showing.
B001O5ZTPG|4|I have gone through several of these and they serve the purpose as described. The magnet on this particular one is stronger than most.
B00960QZGI|4|This dress is very nice, my daughter looks great in it.
B00066TIG0|1|Before you decide to purchase this rabbit fur poncho, or any other product made of fur or containing fur trim, you might want to consider the following: In addition to the millions of of wild animals who are viciously trapped for their fur, untold numbers of dogs, cats, birds, and other \\"nontarget\\" animals are also mutilated and killed in barbaric leghold and body-gripping traps that were set for others. Fur-bearing animals are killed each year on fur farms by anal and vaginal electrocution and in the wild by drowning, trapping, or beating.  By wearing this poncho you will be covering yourself with the skin and fur of a tortured dead animal. Please make a statement on behalf of our animal friends and do not wear or buy fur. COMPASSION IS FASHION!
B008737LAO|5|The CAP is very pretty, the colors and materials used to make it are very good and nice looking. Recommend it.
B007U46TM2|2|I have two pair of 515's that were purchased a few years ago in this same size.  I purchased these again despite the price because it is becoming increasingly difficult to find jeans without flaps or ridiculous amounts of embellishment on the back pockets.  These pants do not fit the same, and in fact stretch so much while wearing that I need a belt to keep them up.  They are also very thin, and are longer in the legs than my older jeans.  Very disappointed and won't be purchasing any more Levi products due to inconsistency in sizing and poor quality.
B0077CSEKW|5|These tops are so comfortable, I have many and will order more.<br />I have had many compliments on this top so I have told my<br />coworkers where to get them. You can't go wrong with Flexibles !!
B00BPPB1Q6|5|Probably not dressy enough to wear to the office, but it looks pretty cute for a day of errands.  The wave turquoise color is quite pretty.
B0052BALXS|5|I was excited to buy these for my daughter-in-law. She loved them and they did not have to be hemmed up.
B00MF1OD6O|5|Already receiving compliments on my new overalls...thanks! :)
B00MO8U5JC|5|Good color and very pratical
B00AFC0L0W|5|I got this dress in red. It arrived SO FAST! When I first tried it on I was upset because it was too large in the waist and bust, but the material was lovely and I loved the way it looked... I just took it to the tailor and he altered it for a reasonable price and it fits like a glove! I am wearing it for my courthouse wedding next weekend. So far everybody loves it as much as I do, and i'm glad I had it altered rather than sending it back! I will most definitely be purchasing from LindyBop again!
B00CB3FFRC|5|Tshirt was a big hit. My son loved it. It came sooner than expected and was good qualitu.
B00DF9LVLU|5|It looks and feels like a million bucks. The leather is smooth with a nice texture and the size is just right for my jacket pockets.  The card slots are tight, but they will loosen up some with use. It also has a bill slot behind the card slots which I like very much.  I can't really say anthing bad about this product.  aif you guys need a nice rich looking good leather RFID wallet this is it.  The price on this is very reasonable.<br /><br />V.

B00382E71U|4|It helps potty train of my son. He likes trains and he doesn't want to make them wet.<br />But like other reviewers said, they're on the small side.
B00Q6U6J30|5|Thanks.
B00HR0TZI4|4|the dress itself and the print are nice, but the fabric is very thin and flimsy. The &#34;sale&#34; price is what it's actually worth.
B0089W33QE|3|This dress is actually great.  The material is a thick jersey and it drapes and swings quite charmingly.  It does require a slip underneath or it gets a little too clingy.  It appears to be well constructed.
B00NVSAX96|5|Ooooooh Yeah.
B00U4IONYM|4|Under sized, but really cute
B00SOIG4DM|5|My daughter loves these. They were perfect fit using sizing chart.
B004CUTU5A|5|I love, love, love this coat!  In fact I love it so much I own two of them.  I have the Ivory color and the Aubergine color in womens size large.  The double zipper took a bit of getting used to but after a couple of wearings I got the hang of it finally. I love the length of the coat.  I am 5ft and on me the coat goes to the tops of my knees which is what I wanted.  The sleeve length is perfect on me as well, between the sleeve and my gloves my hands stay toasty war.  I normally wear a wool hat with the coat but I also like the hood on the jacket for when it is snowing or the wind is blowing.  The hat blocks the wind and snow from my face entirely.  The only thing I don't like about the hood is that the fur trim tends to block my vision but I can remove the fur trim if it gets to bothersome so that is not a major drawback.  Also I have not had any issues with the coat being too tight even with a bulky sweater under it.  Overall for me this is an amazing coat and I got it for an amazing price from the lands end store (under $80) which allowed me to get two!  Since I purchased this coat I have not been cold even once while wearing it!
B00IUFZMLE|3|The outfit was cute but quality was poor.
B00SUMR1H0|4|Would love to have mallard sock
B00APU4AYW|5|I was looking for 100% cotton, raw denim &#34;boyfriend jeans&#34; and decided it made more sense to just buy men's jeans. Glad I did! These jeans are great: cute, well made, and fit well. I washed them in cold water, no soap, in the washing machine first, then let them air dry. They are very long (I usually take a 34&#34; inseam, but these are more like 37 or 38) and they didn't shrink at all in length, but they look cute cuffed up once. Nice jeans.
B00127YBAA|5|I love this Bustier after getting the perfect size.  I'm sick of bras and straps, always having to adjust them as they loosen during the day and my shoulders end up sore.  FYI, this does come with a set of removable straps as well. I am a 44DD exact, though I do find different bra makers seem to have their own sizing and always have to try on before buying.  After reading the reviews on this, and suggestions to order a band size up, I ordered a 46DD.  The cups do run large and it rode up a bit into my arpit, especially when sitting.  I exchanged for a 46C and it fits perfectly.  I also found I could hook it together and shimmy into it with nylon panties on to help it along around my hips which are 51&#34; at the widest.  The band has just enough give.  A pair of control top panties keeps the tummy &#34;up&#34; as well so I don't have the little pouch under the band.  There is an extra row of hooks to tighten another inch+ if you lose a little weight, which is great.<br />The elasticized waist band is a miracle in itself.  I've worn this 16 hours a day for 3 days straight and the band never curled up and retained perfect shape after taking the bustier off as well.  I find the boning in this item perfectly placed for fabulous and &#34;perky&#34; support.  It is very comfortable after 2 washings to break it in a bit.<br /> So, in short, based on the particular sizing of this item.....I find if you order 2 band sizes up and 2 cup sizes down, it should fit perfectly.  And remember, you can hook it and shimmy into it with some nylon panties on to help it along.
B00AW783H8|5|very cute
B0026CABSG|5|I bought this a little on the large side.<br /><br />The seaming is perfect on this shirt. It washes like a dream.<br /><br />Foxcroft shirts are very well made and look sharp. Love the navy.
B00HWQWNBO|4|These shirts are great they are comfortable and hold up well.
B00A3QKAEW|3|This shirt is pretty see through. You probably need to wear a tank underneath but that's not what I was looking for
B00FXHD0HU|3|Is this a whole corset dress or just a top? I'm looking for a dress similarly like this one but I can't tell if it's a dress or a top because no one posted any reviews.
B00S8T121G|2|The cut of this shirt is for a man.
B00913H2ZS|5|Leggings, medium, are a little bigger than I expected. I'm a US12 in most items of clothing. I guess that is because there is an incredible amount of stretch. Officially my favorite pants!
B005QM4G8Y|4|This is not a sweater bra, obviously, but the angled cups have a curiously minimizing impact on my figure. This is fine when paired with the right dress. Comfortable and smooth, the design looks elegant on the body. Straps are supportive. I remain fond of the company and the style.
B0062F06FG|5|There is a lot of purplish blue and peach in the pattern of this dress, which I don't think shows up as well in the photo.  The fit is true to size, very flattering, and I felt very comfortable wearing it with black pumps. I took the dress in to my local bead shop and picked out glass beads to match and create earrings and a necklace to wear with it to a fancy dinner party.
B001O9BEDS|5|These T-shirts are nice and comfortable, they are perfect for my what I need and I like the quality of them as well.
B00FJJPNPY|5|I love this backpack! Nothing bad to say, it's perfect
B006TCL05M|4|It's a good secure fit for my 7 3/8 head.  The dye is a little disappointing having discolored after a couple of good sweats though.  I attempted a wash but it was no good.
B00CO5FLMQ|5|fine
B00NLK60OG|5|I'm normally a small but my friend told me the sizing is somewhat too large so I got an extra small and it fits perfectly. These are my most favorite scrubs ever! I eventually want to replace all mine with these, they are the perfect fit, color, and feel great. They also do not fade due to the material which is great because my other dark blue scrubs fade easily.
B00M4CC6KE|5|Grand daughter loved it.
B00K8BUX0I|1|Very poor quality.
B00JJ9JV2G|2|Sizing runs very small.  I'm usually a medium, but could not fasten a large, and the sleeves were way too short;
B0059DWKYM|4|I love the style of this jacket, but for a regular size guy it is to BIG.<br />My husband it is normally size M and bought this jacket in Small, and when we tried looks like XL.<br />The quality is good ans style is very nice, but before buy it be aware of select 1 or 2 sizes less than you need.
B00HQ51DSK|4|Great buy
B00CX1JSTI|3|We bought this at the same time as another Flexfit cap, (6277).<br />although they were both the same size, this one seemed to run smaller than the other.<br /><br />The bill is definitely not as wide on this cap so it tends to look a little small.<br />The cap itself is great quality though, but probably wouldn't order this particular style again due to the fit.
B00PZKXS2C|5|Love this dress.  Lots of complements on ie
B00LCD33VC|1|It was not the best looked more like George Washington then a southern belle! The hair was of nice quality, just didn't give the look I wanted.
B00LMPFTMG|3|This product is not nearly as slimming as a typical yummie tummie product.  It does smooth, and secures nicely at the bottom, but it does not provide enough support around the middle.
B00KRH752W|1|I have purchase body magic products in the past..however that was when Ardyss first became aware to the public..This was my 3rd time purchasing the body magic long and it does not perform to my expectation..this product will not hold your mid section in and provide support to your thighs and legs..in fact this product adds to your personal weight and will require you to purchase your clothing larger..my lower abdominal section protrudes because of several c sections..the body magic did not &#34;suck in&#34; this lower section...I would not recommend this product
B005J78LWI|5|Wow! Wow. That's all I could say when I first opened the package.  The fit is great for me.  I am 5'5\\" 108.  It is a pretty snug fit but not tight. The waist band comes in a little bit. It is true to the sizing chart which is different than say a women's sizing at a department store.  The sizes are more like juniors. The fake leather is so soft, feels like real leather.  The color is true to the picture (I ordered black). A great jacket for the price.<br /> The Picky Details<br />  The fit is like a real bikers jacket.  Its not like some of the short p/leather jackets that are skin tight all over with out a specific waist band... Which is what i was hoping for BUT it is a very attractive jacket so Im pretty sure i'm going to keep it. The sleeves are a wider fit than the rest of the jacket, like they are sleeves for a medium.  It's not significantly different or super noticeable but just an oberservation.  The body of the jacket tapers in at the bottom, implying that it hits just below the natural waist line.  When I tried it on i was wearing a sports bra (i'm a 32A) it was hitting me at my hip bone (where low rise pants belt line is) which was a little uncomfortable for me because I don't like pressure on my abdomen but if you tolerate fitted cloths on your belly like high rise pants or waist belts you will have not problem.  I pulled the chest area up just a little simulating what a regular bra would do for me and the waist of the jacket raised to a better fit for me.  Like I said, I hadn't been expecting the biker jacket fit, so I am kind of comparing it to the other style previously described above.<br />Conclusion:<br />  Great jacket for the price.  So cute I'm keeping it even though it's not what I was anticipating.<br /><br />- Mrs. Genevieve Bievenue
B008EX3228|3|They shrunk when I washed them. And they were to short. They were the right size and they still fit.
B00MUUY608|5|This top was perfect. I'm a 30d so the girls were a little tight but added to the sexy appeal of this top. I have a difficult time finding tops that fit but this was amazing. The lace wasn't the greatest quality but overall the bustier looks great. I would not recommend this for anyone who is 34+ in band sizing
B00R9QV2UA|3|Cute but way too big on my 7 month baby girl.
B00BYE6PNC|3|The thinner the cotton the worse it washes. This Tshirt was no exception. I guess the days of heavy weight well made T shirts is long gone.<br />this shrunk in length first wash, although it states preshrunk. Its very thin cotton which also wrinkles like crazy in the dryer. Delta pro weight is the maker. I think Ill stick to Gildan Tshirts from now on. They wash and hold up better.
B00MI2LT9O|2|Run smaller than the chart. Can't wear them
B002ZF49V4|5|I bought these for my teen daughters birthday. I was worried because she has quite large feet (size 11 in womens!) and I usually buy her socks that are specifically for her foot size. But these actually stretched to fit her feet. Many decorative knee socks have so much stitching (because of the pictures on them that) they will not stretch to accommodate her feet. But not these. Her and her friends loved them!<br /><br />The shipping was very fast on these as I received them 2 business days after I had ordered them. Another item that was ordered at the same time with expedited shipping took 5 business days.
B00PJOYUHQ|5|Love my waist cincher. It is so comfortable compared to the first one I ordered from a different vender.  It does roll up a little in the back but I think it's because I have a deep arch. It fits longer in the front which Is a plus
B005CSOFFQ|2|This hoodie runs much smaller than other Champion fleece I have in the same size and the weight was more for a fashion garment than for warmth.  I returned it.
B00075ZYKO|4|It's a nice quality shirt. I use it for running and so far it hasn't fallen apart. Purchased Dec 2012
B00K6YETOI|5|This blouse arrived yesterday and I know it is going to be one of my wardrobe essentials. Very well made, fits nicely, and is eye catching. I wore it to a concert last night and it was very comfortable!
B0050DMP3C|5|Beautiful bows. They came beautifully packaged, and are a great quality. I am very impressed with the huge variety of colors! Thank you Ema Jane!
B00GYNY346|5|love the color
B00L28LF1M|5|Looks a lot like the one in the movie. The dark blue, and red is perfect, and the lines are black. Just somewhat small. no biggie.
B00QALCX6C|4|I am 6'2&#34; slender build (42 long suit jacket) and their US Large &#34;3XL&#34; size is a little tight in the chest and the sleeves are a little short. Great jacket otherwise
B0084MYEIU|4|Good quality and beautiful!!!!
B006C73RUU|4|THERE WASN'T AN OPTION TO CHOOSE A LENGTH, JUST A WAIST SIZE, SO THEY HAD TO BE HEMMED AND COST ADDITIONAL MONEY. BUT THE COLOR AND QUALITY WERE GREAT.
B00C2DC9CU|5|These fit snug, but not too tight so they are uncomfortable. You don't have to worry about continually pulling them back up, if you are active in them.
B00OS6P69C|3|I expected a fuller looking scarf. This one is rather thin and lightweight. The colors are pretty, though.
B00C4B39X8|5|Absolutely as described. Fast shipping and was undamaged.
B001A64XNS|2|The shirt is nice and very good material, but the xs size is too large and therefore I do not stay well. another observation I thought was coming all bone shirt with pants and did not.
B0041KN3YU|5|We needed red tights for a school play -- these were red!  But, they also turned out to be nice and soft, with good stretch, and held up pretty well.  Good find.
B00H3C62FU|2|These socks have weird proportions. The foot part is big, bigger than my 8-month-old's foot, but the elastic at the top is way too tight even for her, let alone a bigger 1-year-old who will have thicker legs, too. They pinch her calves so tightly that they leave deep, purple grooves. I know it's hard to make baby socks that stay on, but damn, babies need circulation in their feet, too! I ended up stretching them up to under her knees, where the leg is a little narrower, but then the heel is halfway up her calf... Grotesque socks. They should've used a wide stretchy band (like other brands of baby socks) instead of a narrow regular elastic band that cuts into the chub.
B00BLVDLPI|4|Yep, looks awesome. But still, it is a bit large for my size. Anyways, a great producto. Would recommend. a
B00MOFEIKW|5|I purchased this coat for myself and a friend seen me wearing it and asked for one.  It's perfect for nice days when there is rain in the forecast but it's too warm for a jacket.  Others can see your attire yet you are able to stay fashionably dry!
B00JNALTTO|3|For some reason this was a junior size and not a womens size.
B0076IMB5G|5|This jeans will give you a perfect look and besides the colour fade is original.Best buy you woont regret it.
B00EOWSTNU|5|Fun product for the father in law
B004A8TW4I|3|These are a great product, of course. Somehow I got size 12 instead of size 10. They don't take returns. So I'll give them away to my larger size friends.
B00DI2SQ9E|4|The is great, of course I had to order it a size or 2 bigger however, I like it.
B00816OAGK|1|I am a petite...however  on a shirt like this I can cuff a sleeve and make it work.<br />This shirt has very very long sleeves and the shirt is super long. You list this as a tunic but a tunic is generally wider on the waist and bottom.
B00FYNHKCE|1|I ordered a pair of these they were amazing I loved them.<br /><br />I ordered a large but they sent me a medium, whatever they still worked. I went back  to order a large, and they never arrived I waited 3 months (too late to file a fraud report?) Anyways great pants, too bad they never arrived.
B00P7K5I7I|4|Fits well and it looks just like the picture.
B00EQV0ATA|1|The product description was not as it described.  The sizing was way off.  If a product states it is a &#34;BIG & TALL&#34;  it should fit a &#34;BIG & TALL&#34; man as it was it barely fit a female who is a size XL. I would not recommend this product for a &#34;BIG & TALL&#34; man.
B005CW07UY|5|These are very nice, and reasonably priced.  They are lightweight, fit well, and have ample room in front for comfort.
B000QVDYZQ|5|I ordered 2 of the \\"all men are not created equal-only the finest become grandpas\\" shirts for christmas gifts for my dad and father in law. They are 1st time grandpas and absolutely loved the product.  The size chart is accurate and the tshirt was thick and soft. Perfect for many washings and wearings.
B004IMANXK|5|First of all I am so glad that Gold Toe caught on to NOT EVERYONE WEARS WHITE, OR BLACK socks.  These fit so good, are so comfortable, and now with all the colors are perfect for us.  I hate to wear white socks with my blue scrubs.  I can interchange subtly the colors and now have the socks to match.  Just makes your day a little brighter when your feet feel and look good.  THANKS Gold Toe.
B000MXQ2C0|5|They are just what I expected.
B001V6FHH8|5|Got this for Halloween and it worked perfectly for that night.  I took it out once since then and it took a little bit to get it back into the right form, but it still looks good
