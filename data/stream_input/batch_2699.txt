B003ITZBVI|5.0|I just took a look at the 2010 DC animated film, Batman: Under the Red Hood, to see if it still held water after a few years, and stands with the rest of the DC animated film line. I must say, I think it still holds up pretty good.<br /><br />Most of why this film works is because of the creative team. It was directed by Brandon Vietti. He has done a lot of Batman work, including Young Justice, The Batman, and Batman: The Brave and the Bold, but sadly, not on the original and perfect Batman: The Animated Series. Moreover, the screenplay was written by Judd Winick, who also wrote the comic book storyline that this film is based on, called Batman: Under the Hood, which ran in the Batman series back in 2005. So we know that the creative team has considerable experience dealing with the Dark Knight, so we should get a pretty faithful adaptation here, and we do. Years after the death of his sidekick, Jason Todd a.k.a. Robin, Batman is still battling underworld crime in Gotham City, which is run by the mob boss Black Mask. However, things get shaken up when a new upstart who has taken the mantle of the Red Hood starts taking territory and influence away from Black mask. Things get personal for Batman, when it appears that the Red Hood may in fact be Jason Todd, back from the dead. To make matters worse, Black Mask hires the Joker to help them take care of both the Dark Knight and the Red Hood. And it all comes down to a fateful showdown between the bat, the clown, and the boy.<br /><br />The animation and art direction for this film is again, pretty good. Like most of these DC animated films, the art style is pretty similar to what we are ready got in the DCAU, but just different enough to tell that this isn't the same universe and were getting a different story. The action throughout this film is very good. I can tell what's going on and who's fighting who. In particular, I was very impressed with some of the acrobatic animation that went along with the Nightwing and Jason Todd characters. The original animated series could never get away with animation that was that crisp and that fluid, but they pull it off in this film very well, mostly because it's got a much larger budget. There are some very good shots of Gotham city in this film, and I get a much better sense of how large and bustling this city is, and there is also some fairly decent CGI with the vehicles, including the Batplane. There are a few flashback scenes that hearken to an earlier time of comic books. The design and colors here look more akin to what we would've seen in the Silver Age of the 1960s, sort of like the old Adam West series. The henchmen have their own outfits that follow their still in boss's gimmick, and the Dynamic Duo have their earlier, more colorful costumes from that era. However, there are a few hiccups in the overall art design. I'll say that Bruce Wayne looks kind of odd without the Bat cowl on; his hair looks like some sort of Army sergeant's crew cut, which I have never pictured Bruce with. The opening credits leave much to be desired, as they look like what is real-life video with some grainy Photoshop filters over it, which isn't as good as it sounds. The end credits are also similar to this, but with only one continuous shot of rain falling on a city street. For a very interesting movie, it's got very un-interesting bookends.<br /><br />The characters and their voice actors are very well done in this film, for the most part. This film sets a pretty good tone right off the bat, with a pretty intense and gruesome opening scene of the Joker beating the second Robin, Jason Todd, with a crowbar. Right away, this film establishes that it is dark and gritty, even more so than the animated series (which, in case you didn't know, this film is not in continuity with). However, Jason is portrayed here in a way that shows that he is not helpless or without dignity. Later, there is a very good introduction for his new persona, the newest Red Hood, which immediately establishes that he is skilled, and a threat to both the criminals in Gotham City and a physical match for Batman. A lot of what makes Jason Todd so good comes from his voice actor, Jensen Ackles, who does fantastic. He perfectly delivers the seriousness of what's happened to the character, as well as his cockiness and sense of humor. Also, in the flashbacks were he's a teenager, Vincent Martella (whom you will probably most recognize as the voice of Phineas from Phineas and Ferb, and Greg, young Chris Rock's only white friend from Everybody Hates Chris) performs decently as the angsty teen Robin. However, was far more impressed by the performance of his younger brother, Alexander, as the very young Jason Todd, who was able to get across the characters joy and excitement about his new life as a superhero sidekick. One of the best performances in this film is from the legend-(wait for it)-dary Neil Patrick Harris, who takes over the role of Dick Grayson/Nightwing, who was also the first Robin. I get a real sense of Dick's lighthearted attitude, which contrasts well with Batman's more sullen disposition. I'd say this was a case of perfect casting. Bruce Wayne's trusted butler, Alfred, is also good. I will admit that his voice actor caught me off guard for a second; he sounds almost just like the original. In fact, I had to look it up. It's not the original, Efrem Zimbalist, Jr., but rather Jim Piddock, who does very good, as evidenced by my initial confusion. Also appearing as a side character in this film is one of Batman's greatest enemies, Ra's al Ghul, voiced here by the great Jason Isaacs, who does phenomenally well. Isaacs displays all of the qualities that I've come to expect from the Demon's Head; he is cool, calm, elegant, not without honor, and believably remorseful in this story. Isaacs' British accent is back in full force here and it works well with Ra's al Ghul, conveying his class and aristocratic demeanor. However, not every performance was a home run, in my opinion. Wade Williams did fairly well as Black Mask in trying to convey what they wanted the character to be like in this film. However, I think the problem is their approach, not particularly Williams' performance. Here, Black Mask seems more like an angry gangster akin to Tony Montana than an in-control crime lord. He comes across as a petulant child, in my opinion. However I did very much like his assistant, Ms. Li, voiced by Kelly Hu, as a levelheaded aide who doesn't bat an eye at her boss's tantrum-like behavior. Also the android Amazo makes a brief appearance towards the beginning, although I can't explain why he looks like a buff Namor the Sub-Mariner here, but is appearance does get cooler as he sustains battle damage, giving off a very Terminator-esque vibe.<br /><br />In the end though, what the acting comes down to are the performances of main hero, Batman, and the main villain, the Joker. And here, both do . . . okay, but not great. I'm probably being too critical here, because in my mind, both actors are matched up to previous performances that are near impossible to top. So, you could say that it's unfair to judge them as bad, only because they're up against an insurmountable wall. Bruce Greenwood (whom you know as Captain Christopher Pike from the new J.J. Abrams-directed Star Trek films) does objectively pretty good as Batman. But like I just said, he's not as perfect as Kevin Conroy was, but he is good at his own right. Greenwood can convey the repressed emotion of Batman, but not the same of authority and power that Conroy could pull off, both as Bruce Wayne and as the Dark Knight. Overall, Greenwood did well enough for this film, and he would later go on to reprise his role as Batman in the Young Justice series. My critique of the Joker's performance is pretty much the same. Here, the Clown Prince of Crime is voiced by none other than John DiMaggio, a veteran voice actor whom you have heard before as Dr. Drakken from Kim Possible, Jake from Adventure Time, and Bender from Futurama (throughout most of this film, I half expected the Joker to tell Batman to bite his shiny metal ass). Here, he does pretty good as the Joker, but again, doesn't give us the same perfection that Mark Hamill could do. However, he still does objectively very well. We get all of the good characteristics of the Joker that we've seen before; DiMaggio delivers very well the character's dark humor, irreverence, sadism, and madness, far better than some other recent voices for the Joker that I've heard. I'd say that as the voice of the Joker, John DiMaggio places as a solid second-best. Again, my opinion of these two performances is marred by the fact that I grew up with the original animated series, which remains in my mind as one of the best interpretations of these characters ever done, which is a hard standard to live up to.<br /><br />The climax for this film is very well done. It is intense, suspenseful, has great action, and very good use of the characters' gadgets. It comes down to Jason, the Joker, and Batman in an interesting variant of a Mexican standoff. What makes this climax so good is that it contains a great discussion of the ethics and reasoning of Batman. You really get a feel of how Batman thinks and how that plays into his actions and how he deals with his enemies. Contrast this with the ethics of Superman, which are also very good, but very different, which plays into the differences of these characters but also allows for both of their greatness. Overall, this was a very good film. It had a compact story that was complex but not too difficult to follow. We got great performances from most of the actors, and there was a great ethical discussion at the end. This is a very good entry in not just animated Batman films, but Batman films in general.<br /><br />The DVD extras here are pretty good. There the standard sneak peeks and trailers, and so forth. There are two pretty good documentaries about each of the robins featured in this film: Dick Grayson and Jason Todd. These documentaries highlight the histories of each character, and gives good insight on their similarities and differences and what made each character good in his own right. Also included standard with these DC animated films are a few episodes of the original Batman: The Animated Series, which on this disc are some of the best episodes from the entire series run, including Robin's Reckoning, the fantastic Mad Love, and the interesting The Laughing Fish. As per some of the recent entries in the DC animated films line, this one also includes as a bonus feature a short film, Jonah Hex. Don't worry; it has nothing to do with the live-action Josh Brolin film and this one is actually pretty good. It was directed by Joaquim Dos Santos and music by The Track Team, some of the guys behind the Avatar animated series and some episodes of Justice League Unlimited. There's good art design here, even better than the DCAU's version of the character, as well as good voicing by Thomas Jane as Jonah and character portrayal. What I've noticed with this and the other DC animated short films is that there less like adventures or battles, and more like \\"A Day in the Life of\\"-type stories, which fits perfectly with the nature of the short films, and gets across what's good about the characters without overstaying their welcome. The short film is pretty good, in and of itself, but I'd do think that it's got kind of a cruel and dark ending, but then again I suppose it fits the character.

B005QUQP76|5.0|This is a quality mouse and I like the fact that you can change the tracking resolution on it via a pair of buttons behind the scroll wheel. Sniper mode button is cool too. Mouse is comfortable and fits in my hand (i have pretty big hands so I find most mice give me cramps as they are too small). It is made of good materials and I feel it will last a long time - nothing feels cheap about it. It has a heft to it but it is not so heavy that fatigue would be a concern. I haven't bothered installing any additional drivers for it. Plugged it in and it just works great!

B00CDT41RY|1.0|The plot and characters could have worked very well without all the exploding blood, gratitutious violence so typical of the egomaniac writer/director.  It probably appeals to seriously disturbed 17 year old males.  I wonder why I wasted my money buying it; probably the two leading actors, who are very talented but who are unable to rise above the horrid script.<br /> I would not recommend it to any audience.  I'm sorry that I supported Tarrentio's efforts financially by wasting $5. on the cost.

The novel is a fast read in spite of its size and in places becomes so compelling you stay with it long past the time you'd planned to spend reading. As entertainment it's a safe bet.

Based on the physical layout of Lee Oswald's sniper's nest, this entire scenario could never happen.

B003L77G6A|4.0|You're the writers and creators of The Big Bang Theory, a successful sitcom on CBS that's in syndication. Your sitcom has great ratings for the network while having at its core one of the most unique characters on television in Sheldon who is played by Jim Parsons so capable an acting talent that he's already won an Emmy and Golden Globe for his portrayal of your ultra brilliant yet infantile lead character. For Season 4 the answer would seem obvious. Just keep the four nerds isolated, lonely and searching for contact, while being annoyed by Sheldon, heck it worked before.<br /><br />But in doing so what would even be the point of a fourth season. There are only so many stories about four guys in an apartment that you can keep interesting without delving into a parody of what your show once was. In essence the writers of The Big Bang Theory either had to start writing a new program or throw in the towel on the shows' progression.<br /><br />In Season 4 The Big Bang Theory makes the smart decision to get away from what made the show such a hit. Whereas early seasons revolved around four socially isolated geniuses and their interactions with an attractive neighbor, Season 4 sees the geeks evolve into manhood. This leads to a show stretching itself into wonderful new dynamics and avoiding the trap of staleness that often sinks most shows.<br /><br />In Season 4, Leonard is post break-up from Penny and has started facing his loneliness and begins dating. In one episode he asks Howard to set him up leading to an awful first date that ends with a realization of self-respect. Whereas his character was once purely awkward the Leonard in Season 4 seems willing to grow. This leads to a relationship with Raj's sister Priya that further propels him into adulthood. Meanwhile, Sheldon takes to his relationship with Amy Farrah Fowler started at the end of Season 3 with a surprising ease (considering who he is) creating a wonderfully unique dynamic that elevates the show. Instead of being given a typical young person's relationship where sex seems to be all that matters, both Amy and Sheldon wade slowly and carefully into their dynamic. Watch the episode when Amy asks Sheldon to meet his Mother and you'll see the exact opposite feelings at work that you usually do in sitcoms, when Amy says she doesn't have a desire for a sexual relationship with Sheldon, his character is touched \\"that's the most pragmatic thing anyone has ever said to me.\\"<br /><br />It's this stretching of the core group that creates a great pace throughout Season 4. The most growth is scene in Howard and his relationship with Bernadette. Where the constantly aroused engineer before spent his time obsessing over sex seemingly only to provide comedic fodder, the Howard in Season 4 is a real character trying to commit to a relationship with Amy while examining the dynamic with his mother. Look for the episode where Howard decides against a lonely night to himself as the ultimate sign of growth where he abandons his science fiction fantasies to pursue a real relationship.<br /><br />In propelling the main characters into new situations The Big Bang Theory makes a wise gamble that pays off. As instead of further isolating these lonely geeks, in Season 4 the geeks step out of their shells more than ever bringing their amusing awkward tension to greater comedic heights.f being given a typical young person's relationship where sex seems to be all that matters, both Amy and Sheldon wade slowly and carefully into their dynamic.

B009NX88JU|5.0|this is a sweet, funny and at times heartbreaking story.  It brings back memories of my own.  The cast is perfect and the music is amazing!
B008JFUO4U|5.0|I am a picky sci-fi elitist viewer.  I admit it.  To prove it, I opine that the only good Star Trek (of the Shatner vintage) was \\"Wrath of Khan\\".  The others varied from \\"sucks\\" to \\"really sucks.\\"  (The new cast though is excellent with Chris Pine at the helm.)  And, the only good Alien franchise films were 1 & 2.  The rest-drivel for plebes.  It takes a lot to win me over.  Don't even ask about Will Smith's pitiful attempts in any of his serious stabs at sci-fi.  Drivel and dross.  (Though \\"Men in Black\\" was good as a sci-fi satire.)  Harry Potter?  All suck.  The \\"Star Wars\\" franchise films started with a bang and then made me want to tear off my ears with the bad acting.  \\"Avatar\\" was eye candy, but largely just Pocahontas with Dragons.  The last really great sci-fi film was James Cameron's \\"The Abyss\\", but only the Director's cut as the theatrical release...you guessed it...sucked!  Yeah, I'm picky and a snob.  So sue me.  I admire \\"Soylent Green\\", original \\"Planet of the Apes\\" and \\"Omega Man\\" just because they were novel in their day and had Charlton Heston.  (Heston always gets at least a nod of admiration because,... well, it's Heston.)  But even they were dated.  My standards are high and so I went to \\"Oblivion\\" in the \\"cheap theater\\", just 3 weeks before its release on DVD/Blu Ray.  Frankly, with only a low 53% from Rotten Tomatoes, I expected very little.  Boy was I wrong.<br /><br />Tom Cruise, always dedicated to whatever project he's doing, has pulled it off.  In spades!  This film is tight enough to float like an aircraft carrier in any storm.  The plot is both intriguing and confident enough to play out over the entire length of the movie.  Gradual reveals with respect for a discerning audience.  It is not \\"derivative\\",--a word critics use to sound high brow-- as frankly this combo of plot twists, surprises, and tempered revelations never creates a hole in the plot.  And I've never seen it done before.  A totally new take on earth apocalypse and Alien invasion.  And it's unique in making the Alien master-race ominous yet virtually never appearing on screen.  The facts are layered in discovery, just as they would be to the viewpoint of Cruise, the hero of the story.  The emotions are credible.  The audience is presumed to have brains.  I suspect the negative reviews I've read were because it is not a sound-bite movie.  It expects you to think and take hints without forcing you to come to the director's conclusion all at once.  The acting superb.  Kudos to all the principles, which really is confined to just 3 actors.  Morgan Freeman appears briefly but in a pivotal role.  The rest of this story rests on the backs of just 3 main characters.  Yet this epic sci-fi film is far from claustrophobic and is anything but \\"small\\".  It literally encompasses the entire earth.  The cinematography is grand.  The story is compelling and commands empathy.  The heroism is realistically portrayed.  The plot and writing are superb.  There were a few very minor script tweaks I would have made, which I can't say or it would spoil the plot twists.  In fact, though the main \\"reveal\\" occurs about 2/3rds of the way into the film, even the last 5 minutes still give little, welcomed, and faithful-to-the-plot surprises.  It has just the right blend of drama, action, wisdom, shock and humanity to rate 5 of 5 stars from me.  Yes!  From me.  A great film.  If you just want sci-fi schlock, stick to \\"2012\\", or \\"Independence Day.\\"  But if you want a quality film that you can see over and over and still enjoy, you can't do better than \\"Oblivion\\"!

If you are generally ambitious, it is a good read to just be self aware of the choices we make as women that could hold us back in our careers. Some things we can control, some we cant.

B00632HWOG|3.0|I'd rather use the old style.  It worked fine for what I needed and had the same features.  Just have re-adjust.  Oh well.
B006LXQID8|5.0|I never thought that I would like this movie. I was wrong: it grows on you. The narrator is so unique, the seemingly mundane things that are reported tend to bear relevance to the development of the plot. I laughed so much during the narration of Amelie's early life. This film is all about caring about other people's well-being, being true to yourself and taking risks in reaching out to others and forming relationships. Amelie's introverted character made me exasperated at times, but the film finishes with a classic alls-well-that-ends-well. It's a quirky interesting gem of a foreign film. :)
B006LXQID8|5.0|This French movie is beautiful in every way, from story to cinematography. It's mostly a love story but its also very comical and you'll want to watch it again and again. My girlfriend never has to beg me to watch it with her. It really is a wonderful film.
B008476HBM|4.0|A little slow at the beginning but the story line is great. The language can also be difficult to understand  sometimes that you have  to go back and read a few sentences again.
B0084AXZK0|5.0|I highlighted so much of the book as I read. Great read but also contains brilliant insights & memorable quotes all over the book. I feel like a smarter person for having read this; lots of words I'd never heard before, but looked them up as I went along with Kindle app dictionary. A story from a more thoughtful & intelligent time in society.
B002RPLXWK|5.0|This movie was initially surprising, since it's so different from the first three in the series. Despite the differences, this movie is a continuation of the original series. In its own ways, it's just as good as the rest.<br /><br />With this edition to the Chucky movies comes the addition of humor. A wonderful addition it is.<br /><br />I highly recommend to those of us who like the Child's Play movies and also to those who are fans of horror who like the humor others' lives can provide.
B00AJLHUYO|3.0|I love a good horror movie that makes you jump. Some recent favorites were Insidious and Drag Me to Hell. This movie has some creepy moments where something makes you jump, which is great but mostly this movie consists of watching people getting murdered on old film.  Murder-porn.  The suspenseful aspect of this wears thin after the 1st or 2nd scene like this. After this point it's obvious you're about to witness another grisly murder. The orchestrating villain eventually surfaces however you get no background info. about who he is or where he came from or his motivations.  Personally i was really disappointed in this film.
B005QYKD4I|4.0|Great film but kinda makes the second one's story not make sense.  For instance,  how would megatron know that optimus would have the matrix to restart sentinel?
0064431789|5.0|Never mind this is a story about a boy named Max, my daughters both loved and requested this book so many times that we would often recite it by heart on long car rides.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|It is a great game and super fun worth more than it is and it is free app so if I where u is get it.
067144901X|5.0|Sandra Boynton is a great author...I think I'm going to start collecting....<br />this book is really great as my son is learning animal sounds. He loves to point and mimick each animal sound.
B000IZ21BS|5.0|I remember watching Chucky movies as a kid (I had brothers in high school when I was small). These movies will give you nightmares if you're easily influenced. They're creepy and realistic.<br /><br />This particular movie, the start of a series, is great. It will have you watching new dolls more closely.<br /><br />Voodoo enables the soul of a killer to live on, allows a killer to continue killing to accomplish his own means. All Chucky wants is to live on (and seek vengeance), and get back to living in a human body. Will this serial killer manage to steal someone else's life?<br /><br />I highly recommend for those of us who like to be creeped out.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Love the show and the 3rd season, though I didn't always like the writer's decisions throughout the season (don't want to spoil for those who haven't yet watched)!
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I really liked this book.  So many trials she went thru and put herself thru.  But she was not a quitter.<br />The trail is no easy hike to be done by someone who had never backpacked once.  I have recommended this book<br />to all adults.
B002GYI9C4|4.0|It's always tough to create a new world with a rich history and a new way for magic to work. Sanderson nailed them both.
B004LWZWGA|5.0|I mean not too much say about the product besides it getting here really fast and not damage what so ever done to it.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I just love the way Neil Gaiman writes. His words floats effortless and becomes sentences with emotions and ambience I rarely meet. There is a soreness and authenticity in his writing that really touches me.<br />What this book is really about? I dont know. But I feel as if it is som sort of an autobiography, where Gaiman faces his terrors and is forgiven for sins committed. Or it could be a fantastic fantasy book where the protagonist is seven years old and faces gentle Creators and horrific vultures, all by the ocean at the end of the lane. The epilogue is particularly beautiful. Enjoy!
0316247545|5.0|This piece of pony merchandise is perfect to hold me over until season 4 starts. It has plenty of trivia, enough facts for fanfiction, and a lot of information that I just didn't know before. It's brilliant!
159562015X|5.0|It was very informative to discover the areas where out of which I should operate. I discovered that I am really in the wrong career path and I am now pursuing education that will place me into a career which will use my strengths much more often.
B000HX499S|5.0|Daughter chose Audrey Hepburn as a role model for school project. She really loved the move and so do I.
B004SUWR2C|4.0|UNO! I have always liked this game and have introduced it to my children, and to my parents as well. But what an interesting twist to be able to play it on my Kindle Fire HD. Graphics are great too!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is REALLY COOL! I enjoy ever bit of this game.<br />I Love playing games like this!<br />If you love this game you will love Little Big Cit.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Finally, games that are worth my time. I had just about stopped playing app games but this one will hold your interest. You have to find clues in order to get out of the room and you really have to think about where those clues are. I hope they make a lot more games like these.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This has been my Favorite door opening game app so far. Looking forward to more levels being added. It was quite challenging!
B006M7JCC2|5.0|Probably the best description of the afterlife that I have read in a long time. I have read lots of NDE stories but this one felt the most real to me. That is how I image/feel it to be.
B009IJJ5B4|5.0|I loved it: a mix of CSI, Monk and The Mentalist, it's witty, it has cliffhangers. I give it three thumbs up!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|I loved this book! First of all, I'm a huge Tina Fey fan and love \\"30 Rock.\\" She's funny through her writing as much as she is on television. I learned a lot about how she became this famous comedian and the \\"behind the scenes\\" of her life. The only thing I would have changed would be that she write more about \\"30 Rock\\" than she did but it was still funny. For any Tina Fey fan or just looking for a good biography, this is a good choice!
B0032KPE0G|3.0|not a bad movie, but I really did not like the American woman character played by Andie Macdowell at all.  Maybe I am just in a different stage of my life and cannot appreciate the misery of this chaotic dating scene.  I would have dumped that woman well before the end of the movie.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|I liked the writing style from the beginning.  The story was a little slow to take, but when it did I didn't want the end to come.
B005F3GMAO|3.0|I love Richard Branson and I really enjoyed much of the book but it seemed to repeat stories and jump around in a way that was a bit distracting. It needed a good editor.<br /><br />It was great to see how he made many of his decisions and how the universe opened up to those who go after their dreams even when your dream doesn't start big.
1608871827|5.0|This is a awesome movie and this book is a great way to enjoy it even more , I highly recommend it !!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Love the game and love that I can play on Kindle just like I can on my PC. Not sure why other bingo games can't be made to enjoy like BB.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a good app very fun game and you get to feed it and groom it it is very good
B00DC7NNAC|4.0|The best part of the movie is when they make everyone stop singing. Love it and well written story line.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|If you have been reading about Law of Attraction and manifesting for some time or are new to it you will Love Pam's fresh approach. It is simple and direct with lots of humour. I have recommended it ot all my clients and friends as a must read and do. She gives 9 simple experiments where you get to test and stretch your manifesting muscles.
B0090SI4LU|2.0|I read the book and liked it a lot, I understand that movies can not get everything in the film that is in the book but this movie tried too hard to do just that. What was the result? A piece meal movie that felt like it jerked from screen to seen. The acting was fine, the dialog was not that great, in fact it flat out ruined what was in the book great moments, but this is mainly do the the rushed feel of the scrip. Also due to the nature of trying to do too much in a short movie the characters seem to fall in love instantly, they instantly form bonds that as a viewer you are supposed to believe happened but you don't. To do this movie right it needed to slow things down. sadly that means taking things out of the story or at lest doing something that made the viewer believe that there was more then a few days in the cave for all these feeling and motivations to grow and change.<br /><br />I really wish they would have made this film in two or more parts so that you can have some character growth in it, and could have some real connections so that the end meant anything close to what it meant in the book.<br /><br />But I understand how hard it is to make a script when the main character has to talk to herself for most of the movie, but the way it was written it changed the base character of Melanie and made Wanda seem less of an altruistic character.<br /><br />Read the book and watch the movie for the sole purpose of seeing the backdrop of the book come to life, it was cool to see the cave, the mirrors and the farm and to see the souls there were some great visuals that is for sure but this is not the best telling of the story.
B00009RGBS|4.0|It replaced one I lost in a move., so it's good replacement. I wish tho ,I'd read Amazon's offers and just ordered the music
B001BR5NN0|5.0|It is one of my favorite movies. I enjoy watching it with my family and friends.  Movie ran smoothly with instant video.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|If you like Ryan Gosling staring at everyone for 2 hours then you will love this movie otherwise stay away from it. Fans of the \\"Arthouse\\" type of film will defend this movie to their dying breath when, other than the first 5 minutes of this movie, is an absolute snore fest.
B00CLF80O0|5.0|Made In Britain/The World Record is a fantastic kick ass live album by Mr Coverdale and his band of very talented musicians. Do you like great old fashion guitar playing? Then look no farther then this album. A fantastic companion to their Made In Japan release. Want you butt kicked? Buy this album.
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Watched this with my teenage granddaughter.  We both thoroughly enjoyed it.  I am grateful there are at least a few movies these days that do not contain inappropriate this, that or the other.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very good game I have enjoyed playing it.  Except for the lack of response when emailing them with an issue.  I never got a response after my skills disappeared. Good graphics and fun to play.
B00280LYIC|5.0|I found this tale to be wonderfully framed in humor so real it had me breathless with laughter, and filled with such engaging actions & thought that I often found myself unable to stop turning pages.  An excellent tale, excellently written.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|Good book with lots of twists and turns.  Women will like this book.  I wanted it to continue.  Worth the money.
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Went to see the second part at the theater and then rented this one. I thought it was going to be funnier but it doesn't really reach the level of Part 2
B009UX2YAC|4.0|My kids and I truly enjoy this game. All 4 of us have Kindle fires and we have all downloaded this game. It's very addictive and my husband and I fight for time on it. Just wish it didn't take so long to get some of the things open and wish that the subway run would change more as it becomes predictable. A must have game for all!
B000ID1J0E|5.0|a friend suggested I watch it, and I love it. Very amusing, kept me laughing, and it really is a great story.
B005544TRQ|5.0|I have watched the show from the beginning and It was so nice to go back and watch it again...just in time for tonight's season premiere.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|I enjoyed the first two books,  but this final book of the trilogy was a little too depressing and sad--much more, in my opinion,than the first two. I had a hard time getting through it. However, the book does make for good discussion.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|it is enjoyable for $5 bucks.  being a American IDOL winner..  i can't wait for the next one.  Will he be more rock or country?
B007TUAHVQ|5.0|We got this as a gift or our 8 year old nephew, he absolutely loved it.  It was very well made
B00985E3UG|4.0|But you have to know these 3 things are the things one has to take in moderation, instead of in everything.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|This movie is defiantly worth the watch. It touches your heart in a way most movies aren't doing. I loved this movie, nothing but a positive review from me.
B00003CXD5|4.0|This is one of my all time top 10 movies. I think everyone should own this or at least have watched it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not like the adds below.  Why did you change the format???.  It is hard to get from one place to another.<br /><br />Shirleysiler
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I absolutely love this book. One of my friends suggested it to me and had me read it. I could not put the book down. Along with the other two. Definitely going to be rereading these books again.
B00571F26Y|4.0|But the book makes a lot of sense. They have changed the wheat since I was growing up & now, it isn't fit to eat!
B0073PPKNM|4.0|A little different than Melody's other cd's, but keeps it interesting when you're playing a string of jazz in an evening--sounds very romantic, so it goes well with a dinner for two (or more)...
B0092SQ5EG|5.0|I love her even more now I know what a professional she is. And what a great work ethic she has.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|GOOD BOOK<br />Some parts are very sad.  I hope that everyone can enjoy this book as much as I did.
B005ZUR724|4.0|While this game is great, there are a few issues. Character design is good, if limited. There are four classes, and more would be nice. Graphics are good. Most quests are somewhat challenging, but completable. It can be hard to find where you need to go, which means a lot of random running around. After an update, you cannot play for a few days because gameloft doesn't care about the kindle fire users, and doesn't actually release the update until days after it requires it to play. Other than that, it is a good game.
0345525558|5.0|The Language of Flowers is well written, engaging, thoughtful, hopeful, and enjoyable.  Everyone I know who has read it recommends this novel to others.  It also forms the basis of lively book club discussion.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i am a gamer and this game is cool. so u should get it and well yah just get the game thanx
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I really enjoyed reading these books, they kept me interested so much that by the third book, I was wishing that the series would not end! My daughter enjoyed them just as much as I did.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game the best game they ever made its also good for kids parents grandparents etc. but this game is addiction I have kpt stooped playing it since I downloaded
1878424319|5.0|Absolutely fantastic book. The shipping was very quick on this product. I got it within the week it was ordered. A quick, but meaningful read.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I viewed the movie first and loved it! So I decided to read the book. Yes there were a few differences, but the character development enriched the story line so much, it didn't matter that I knew how the story would unfold. Sparks is really a gifted author and I plan on reading his other works.
B006AZZPCM|2.0|The app like all other youtube apps for kindle works good for a second but then it breaks. I have downloaded and un installed Tube Mate, vTube, and Play Tube so many times I lost count. IF ONLY ADOBE FLASH PLAYER&trade; CAME WITH ALL DEVICES. It just gets a little annoying when you're trying to watch a youtube video and all you get are Error messages saying &quot;Tube Mate has stopped working unexpectedly!&quot; It started causing problems on my kindle. When I try to look up videos on silk I get a message saying &quot;Silk has stopped working unexpectedly and has been terminated!&quot; So my best advice for people that want to watch youtube is to watch it on a device that has a flash player.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Well done period drama. Have thoroughly enjoyed watching the first several episodes of season one. Plan to watch all of them soon!
B004KPX4W2|5.0|We enjoyed this movie.  Well done.  Nice combination of action with some laughs.  We are looking forward to the sequel.  Is that Red-2?
B002ZG977Y|3.0|Had  just  seen  Wrath  of  the  Titans  and  thought  the  special  effects  were  pretty  good,  so  I  decided  to  give  'Clash'  a  try  wasn't  as  good  as  'Wrath'  but  was  ok.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|I enjoy playing this game. Today it says to update in order to play but there isn't one for Kindle. I was very disheartened about this. Hoping there is a fix as I'd hate to delete all the work I had put into it. Otherwise it's a terrific app if you love farming.
B000FCKIFU|4.0|It is a very good book.  It keeps your interest all through the book.  I would reconmend this to all who like mysteries.
0140544518|5.0|I love this book. It shows a different side of the story of the normal version of the Three Little Pigs. It's a fun twist and will get the younger kids thinking about all of the different scenarios that could have happened. Seeing the wolf's side of the story is very different then the pigs, which it ends up making you not like the pigs at all. The illustrations of this book works well with the story and how it has a newspaper feel, because the wolf is finally telling his side of the story. I highly recommend this book.
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|This is a lovely puzzler. My only wish is that it were longer!  An extended play session of several hours can easily complete the game. Puzzles are challenging enough to be rewarding; easy enough to be solvable, especially with the in-game clues for the tricky bits.  Already looking forward to the sequel!
B006M4F67A|5.0|I love these kind of games.  This one has a great variety and challenges within challenges. I recommend it to beginners on up. Lot of interesting formations.
B00000E2QI|5.0|tempo tone music orchestration vocals quality of recording all combine for a wonderful Carmina Burana experience<br />of the available options chosse this and you'll be happy
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Love this game but now it says to update to keep playing where do I go to do this I really love this game please help
B0037AGASG|1.0|Some idiot commented on my Thursday review that I like Justin Bieber. So, this review is to show that I DONT LIKE JUSTIN BIEBER AT ANNNYYY COST. This may be a short review, but let me tell you, \\"BABY\\" IS A VERY ATROCIOUS SONG. I'm definitely sure that any rock/metal fam doesn't like Justin Bieber. Everyone else who stumbles upon this review, IGNORE JUSTIN BIEBER. If you want a male in music who sounds like a girl, listen to Sleeping With Sirens. Kellin Quinn is awesome, and Justin Bieber is a fool.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|They did a great job tying all the characters together through their individual movies. Packed with action and laughter. Loved it.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love this series!  I would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys Masterpiece Theatre productions!  The characters are interesting and it's easy to get involved in their lives - struggles, heartaches, etc., etc.,  etc.,,  Great entertainment!
B000GFLE1S|5.0|I bought this movie as a present for a friend who had been looking for it for quite a while. She had us all sit and watch us with her, and I had to go buy another copy for myself! Very enjoyable movie, and Chiwetell Ejiofor is amazing.
B007URVZJ6|3.0|I wish it would go a little more into detail with the whole zipping everything into one file, especially with images. I had to go to the help forum to really get the instructions I needed.
B006YTTVHO|5.0|I have know idea what inspired me to choose this read but I'm glad I did. It was a quick read. It did remind me of what I knew and refreshed my thought process.
B005ZCXPP0|5.0|Did a great job at telling the story and keeping you engaged. Quite entertaining and funny.  I am looking forward to the sequel.
B008220BP2|4.0|Great mix of comedy, action and a fun story plot. I loved the uniqueness of it. Good cast choice too.
B0089OBLDO|1.0|Randomly home buttons as you're mid match. Will drop inputs that are done simultaneously such as throw/focus attack/taunt in SF4. Do not buy this thing, seriously. Wasted alot of my time. Happens with multiple PS3,PS2 and Xbox pads I tried.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|My Son Loves It, Especially The Little Sound Effects The Minions Say, It Really Not A Bad Game By Fay
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This is so FUN I am not a great drawer that much which it comes with my finger but I'm not bored that much you get to join Facebook and vs friends and draw so I recommend to get this game
B007SZ0E1K|1.0|i should have bought the 8core amd am3 socket chip. my brother has it and it smokes my intel bigtime. the 8 core was 70 dollars less as well.

B00915G6YE|5.0|Love this series! Some of the best writing and performances in television!  Sad that the show comes to an end after season 8, but luckily I will have the series on blu-ray to fill the void in its absence.
B000089RVX|2.0|the whole CD is awesome but the first song going under is cut from it s beginning ....it starts 30 secs later than the original song<br />don't buy it guys plus the seller is terribly bad i had to order it 3 times !!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I don't understand why everybody's so upset that this isn't the final book. I get that we all want answers, but they'll come eventually. I'm really enjoying the story unfold and seeing where Gideon and Eva are heading. So the author decided to make some extra money and drag the series out, so what?  The story is still interesting and as long as it stays interesting, I'll continue to read the books as they come out.  This book was better than the last book, in my opinion.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Game made you think and be creative. definitely worth playing. I would recommend to anyone.  can't wait for more rooms to come available.
B000O8OTNC|4.0|Sharpener was provided as advertised and shipment was prompt (Item was delivered early!).<br />The sharpener is easy to operate and seems to perform well.  I followed the directions carefully and used it on a couple of my pocked knives and on my kitchen set (all of which are &#34;flat blades&#34;).  The directions indicate that the operator should repeat the &#34;pull&#34; stroke on the CERAMIC side 8 to 10 times for a blade that is &#34;reasonably&#34; sharp, which I did.  As a result, the blades seem sharper, but were not yet &#34;razor&#34; sharp (I usually keep my knives very sharp).  I suspect that the better knives are made of harder steel and may require more work than the 8 - 10 pulls.  I have not yet used the SERRATIONS AND GUT HOOK sharpener but suspect that that process will require much more care and time (as you must match the angle of the grind).<br />I have been looking for a sharpener of this type for awhile as I am prone to overworking a blade while sharpening and probably remove too much &#34;knife&#34; in the process.  So far, so good!  I would recommend this product to others.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I like Bubble Witch Saga and playing the different levels.  The only problem I have with the game is the bubbles releasing before I shoot them.  Then losing two spiders which makes scoring points or stars difficult.
B004SIIBGU|5.0|i really love this app for my phone and my tablet it is really easy to use and i use it a lot
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Minion rush is the best game in the intire world. It is so amazing because there are minions everywhere and you get to go over obstacles.
B00074CBIS|5.0|this is an awesome movie you have to buy it Queen Latifah place in excellent role in it she is very funny and Jimmy Fallon is hilarious
B003M6FGTE|5.0|Glee is one of my favorite shows...rewatching from the beginning in my own way of honoring Corey Monteith even if he wasn't my favorite actor he will be missed terribly, forever riding that midnight train!<br />(Favorite character is Mr. Schue!, to me he has one of the best voices on the show and season on was the best because it introduced us all to amazing performers!)
B00632HWOG|5.0|I use yahoo a lot for my personal e mail account this has been great and real easy to me
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Loved it!  This season offered a broader view into how people would cope when faced with a dying world.  This season was more &#34;human&#34; but also did not disappoint in the suspense either.  Can't wait for the next season!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|The book is real not a made up fantasy where good always prevails.  You step into Chris's life with very real inputs from his wife.  These men sacrifice much more than any of us realize. The book is very easy to read and keeps you wanting to read more and more.
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Mouse is very comfortable for a medium to large hand to use the adjustable weight system is a nice bonus.  Also enjoyed the ability to customize the buttons to whatever program is really nice.
B008602KQI|4.0|Very good psychological movie, interesting script, moved quickly, great character that made you cheer for her to win right to the end.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Ten levels of fun. Solve puzzles and find keys and other needed items to go through all 10 levels. Not so difficult as to be frustrating yet the puzzles require thought and patience to work through. I enjoyed the game, recommend it, and am eager for the additional levels.
B008XKSW7M|5.0|they sure put a variety of birth experiences in the story.  it made me laugh.  i'd watch it again. good acting and also good silliness.
B008OOYALE|1.0|It is fun but takes forever to upgrade dragons ,farms and to buy things. I love the different color dragons. It keeps me coming back for more. But you have to have 50 or more bars of gold to meet the challenges.
B0073Q0DZG|4.0|A movie with a story, crisp and witty.  I enjoyed the characters and would see it again.  Two thumbs up
B00D6B4PUG|2.0|This is the only Kindle app that's disappointed me. The layout is far removed from Gmail 's successful browser layout and its layout on other devices apps. The layout here makes it difficult to fully utilized Gmail 's features.
B005LAIHR2|4.0|As a Tom Cruise fan, I remember being very excited for this film even though I managed to miss its release in Movie Theaters. If you love Musicals and Rock music this is the perfect duo! Some people may criticize the acting as it seems very scripted and cliche at times but the cast play off each other really well. And while the singing talents are not unrivaled there are some strong musical numbers with great choreography and you can tell the cast had a great time filming.<br /><br />I'm sure most people are familiar with the story line from other reviews but for those who don't, here's a brief run-down. In this star-studded classic remake we see Alec Baldwin and Russell Brand as the managers of the infamous \\"Bourbon Room\\" in Los Angeles. Sherrie (Julianne Hough) and Drew (Diego Boneta) play the hopeless young romantic couple in search of fame through their musical talents. Stacee Jaxx (Cruise) is the Rock and Roll Legend that brings charisma to the screen; rocking out in spite of lust-fuelled social protest led by a former groupee (who is now the Mayor's wife) Patricia Whitmore (Catherine Zeta Jones).  Stacee Jaxx's final gig at the Bourbon before his solo career is the highlight for me and for the rest...you'll just have to watch and find out.<br /><br />I'm sure some people will prefer the stage show for the live music element but I love the soundtrack of the film too and would recommend it.<br /><br />This only gets a 5.8 star rating on IMDB but I give it 4 out of 5 stars on Amazon. Easy to watch and entertaining too.
B0055SWM08|5.0|FUN game that quickly engages player.  Nice graphics and soothing music that enhance the different levels of play.  Well worth the .99 it costs - both challenging and addictive.
B00AMBH70S|5.0|Whenever I watch a movie I always concider the question; &#34;Is this worthy to be on my movie shelf?&#34;  I loved this movie! And Jeremy Renner is dynamite!  This is definitely going on the shelf next to the other Bourne movies.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I personally do not play video games. But all of my kids love this one...total silence on road trips etc....and there are 4 of them btw
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|This charger can simultaneously charge multiple devices, especially the newer ones that require more power.  It's a great product to have with so many mobile devices out there
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|This game is appropriate for all. You can get involved in increasing your score each time or to get more gems. I think children as well as adults will pass time playing this game.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Great Sabbath. All the songs are what you would expect. Ozzy sounds great. Iomie jams his you know what off and sounds as good as the old days. Really my only complaint is all the music could have fit onto one CD. Buy it you'll like it.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|My daughter got this game and loved it....then my little boy wanted it on his kindle.lol They both enjoy the levels and find it fairly easy to navigate
B00284G2IA|3.0|THeir music can rip off your soul and making you fantasized into other world of your own. Go listen to it, man!!!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's great! Great for kids all ages and adults too! A fast time passer! I play all the time! I love it
B009VSW15Y|3.0|It is ok, it does have some features that are pretty cool, and it does take pretty good pictures.  Not fabulous but it is ok.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I like this series.  It's better than a soap opera bc there's not as much promiscuity and deceptiveness.  There's an element of class, and honesty.  There are only 2 characters that cause problems, rather than everyone being awful, or having the good people always turn bad.
B001CDWFPC|2.0|No table of contents.  It's hard to navigate and confusing overall.<br />As a study tool, I do not recommend the kindle version.
B00CL68QVQ|3.0|My review isn't the greatest because I am not a big fan of dramas. However, I loved Jennifer Lawrence's character and the overall story at the end was uplifting. If you like a good light- drama, you'll like this flick.
B00B7Y0206|4.0|This app is great very good quality and is very fast. The one dissapointment is that you cant change into small player or change the graphic setting. Only after the video is loaded for slow Internet people like me. But over all I love this app and you should get it too.
B00CH26TL8|2.0|I liked this game but having to buy coins to conyinue playing made this &#34;FREE&#34; game no longer  fun. I don't mind purchasing a game, but tell me upfront if that is how the game is played. I would not have wasted my time on this game had I known.
B003Q6D25U|5.0|My hubby waited for a long time to get this movie. I'm not a big fan of the franchise, but he is. So this DVD/Blu-Ray combo was quite a treat.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Just hard enough but not too hard. I was addicted but started to get good- I actually feel smarter now
B0090KZDSK|4.0|I enjoyed it, was  a not so great ending tho.  I would still read on in this series .  How could one not .
B005DJREJS|5.0|I am way too old to be watching this, but I didn't love it any less.  I loved Season 1.  If you like comedies try this.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|This and the sequel is about the best movies I've watched so far. The 2-disc combo is fantastic! Great movie all-around.
B0096CDG0O|1.0|I love the game but it's stuck at version 2.2.3.  Buy it from Google play to get the 2.8.1 version for newer features and bug fixes.  I would love to give it more stars, but not until the new version comes to the appstore.
B00633W614|5.0|The Clifton Chronicle series is a great read and a perfect escape.  Archer draws you in to his world and you will be hanging out there, even while you aren't reading, wondering what everyone is doing.
B00CDUVDEC|5.0|I'm not sure how to describe the sound of Philip H. Anselmo And The Illegals' \\"Walk Through Exits Only\\". Extreme maybe?  The title of the review pretty much says it all.  These dudes are fast as hell and they pound their instruments.  Phil's vocals sound as strong as they have since Trendkill.  To first time listeners it may sound a little disjointed.  If you think SJR is heavy, just wait.  Sorry, i'm not sure what bands i'd compare them too.....Maybe Death and black metal mixed with SJR, some Slayer type guitar sound effects with hints of Acid Bath sludge, and other stuff mixed in a blender and chopped up.  Phil has reached a new high.  Best songs according to myself are Usurpers Bastard Rant, Bedridden and Walk Through Exits Only.  HEADS DOWN!!!<br /><br />CATEGORIZE THIS SH_T!
B007N85POS|5.0|Anyone who's a fan of the Angry Birds franchise will most certainly enjoy this game. The graphics are amazing. Far better than any previous versions.
B00CWVG1Z8|2.0|The movie starts off fairly decent, then at about the halfway point, it drags on and on and on like a snail trying to drag a brick uphill...<br /><br />Seriously, this movie is not worth watching...
B008BU75IQ|5.0|The Clifton Chronicle series is a great read and a perfect escape.  Archer draws you in to his world and you will be hanging out there, even while you aren't reading, wondering what everyone is doing.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I liked the version I first used and this new one isn't as user friendly. I hate the ads at the bottom and the whole app is just too cluttered. I'd rather have the last app.
B008602KQI|5.0|I loved this movie and can't wait for the sequel to come out! So glad it was not too gorey!
B004U52VPS|5.0|My son loves the challenge of building the images on the card or creating his own designs. Great way to keep him off the t.v. and exercise his problem solving skills. He loves knocking it down and it's a game that I find interesting enough to not yawn half way through it.... love this game.
B008IGANGO|3.0|The TV show is so much better than the film.  But I was in the mood for MASH and could not find the show anywhere
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|This was a delightful film.  How these folks dealt with each others personalities was amusing and funny.  It reminded me that we all grow old at some time in our lives.
B008I43DYU|5.0|This app Works very well, easy to use and comes in very handy not only on my phone but also on my kindle.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|this book was a big upset how long will I have to wait for the next one. it didn't even get really juicy..
B0099RFVXQ|5.0|We entered 3d in the search for a movie and this came up.  We bought it, thinking it was 3D and it was not.  Taking that in to consideration, it was still a great movie.  We enjoyed the action scenes and each had our own favorite super hero.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This game is fun, but make sure you have enough room for it. Nice graphics and sounds. I got it for free, but still worth the price!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|Defiantly love the yeezus album. Kanye defiantly knows what he's doing. Love it to death! Can't get sick of it!
B00CWV8TIU|3.0|This started out very interesting and I thought it had a good story.  However, it just dragged on and eventually I fell asleep.  My husband said it was 'eh'- he stayed away the whole time.  I did see the ending and thought it was kind of silly.
B008QTVNUI|5.0|This show showcases a fine piece of writing.  This acting is top notch.  I recommend this series to all my friends.
0345803493|5.0|I love this series! It's a great romance in an unusual way. I just finished reading it for the third time and couldn't put it down, as always.
B008B92U32|5.0|its very cool and works as long as you have a camera with face detection . if not it works but just not as great
B001ANYDAO|5.0|Really like this book. It's nice to read a nonfiction book that isn't dry. You will enjoy every second of this book. Malcolm Gladwell is an outstanding author.
B0031RS8AI|5.0|This book was so good. it would be for teens and older. I was glued to the book since I got it. I loved every bit. I would really recommend this book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I absolutely love this game. I love to solve puzzles. If you enjoy these kinds of games, get this one. And you will see what I am talking about.
B0050KEVO6|5.0|i ain't used this application in so long i do not even remember it i think it dumb amazon wants reviews and so does the market place pick a place i will not review on both
B004EWFV9K|3.0|See \\"lilian\\"s review [A tired end to a fine series]... her review says it all.<br />I felt almost cheated (and certainly depressed) by this book's story arc and epilogue.<br />Kind of shocked at all the 5-star reviews.  Yes, it's well written (Mankell is excellent at creating mood and taking the reader into the psyche of his main characters).  And [SPOILER ALERT] it's probably quite realistic in its depiction of Walling's struggle's with incipient dementia or Alzheimers.  But my goodness the story line goes back and forth and hither and yon for hundreds of pages, with not much of a payoff at the climax.  And then there's that ultra-depressing (however realistic) epilogue.<br />I'm glad I read it, the final book in the series, but I'm disappointed that Mankell didn't give our aging hero a more respectful closing act.
B00A3AUGEW|4.0|I like his style of music and the way he presents it to the people. I would go see his concert if close by.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I use on my kindle fire and it is So much fun!  Addictive way to pass the time:)definitely recommend for everyone to try!

B005HF0GMA|5.0|I used to watch this show when it was on tv, & I am so excited to have found it on Amazon.  I LOVE this show. I am into mediums & the whodunit shows, but I love the familial element that this show brings. Allison is the best!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I have been hearing about subway surfer since long but was reluctant to download it thinking what difference would it be than to play some other game of this sort say temple run or others like it. I took quite a lot of time to give it a try. But I must say subway surfer is a huge fun for me and my family. Specially on Kindle Fire HD the animation is awesome, speed is fast, music is awesome and overall experience of playing it a just fun packed. I would say this is the only game i have seen which gives so many option to play with even in free version. So many characters, so many play stuff like skate board, powerbag etc.<br /><br />Giving it 5 rating as I dont see any flaw or anything I would want more from a free version. It never stucks, never fails to load, never hampers my other application. Thanks to the developers and Amazon appstore.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|Directors and writers: The Wachowskis and Tom Tykwer.<br /><br />Staring: Tom Hanks, Halle Berry, Jim Broadbent, Hugo Weaving, Jim Sturgess, Doona Bae, Ben Wishaw, James D'Arcy, Zhou Xun, Keith David, David Gyasi, Susan Sarandon and Hugh Grant.<br /><br />Running Time: 172 minutes.<br /><br />Rated R for Violence, Language, Sexuality/Nudity and some Drug Use.<br /><br />Note: Before you begin reading, I'd like to note that writing about this film was a bit of a nightmare for myself. I say this not to inspire sympathy, but to note what kind of film this and that I may need to watch it more than once (which I most certainly will!). Hopefully, I hope to those that read enjoy.<br /><br />It's weird how things turn out and what people react to certain artworks. One man's masterpiece is another man's garbage. Another's favorite author is on another person's all time most hated author's list. One person worship a welcome franchise while another wishes to go up in flames. All works react differently to others, and sometimes, its fascinating to see how others react to it. Such is the case of Cloud Atlas.<br /><br />Cloud Atlas came out during the Oscar season of 2012 to a very mixed reception. Based on the book of the same name by David Mitchell (who gets a nice little cameo near the end of the film!), the film sported currently sports a 67% on Rotten Tomatoes and while that usually implies a mixed to positive response, looking at the actual responses of critics was something else entirely. To illustrate; The late and great Roger Ebert remarked the film as being one of the most ambitious pictures ever made and even made a nice mention on his end of the year list. On the other, TIME magazine said the film was one of the worst, if not the worst, film of the year.<br /><br />So where do I stand in the skies of Atlas? Well, from the first few minutes of the film, I knew I something in for something different. Atlas is a film that hits spans the emotional spectrum in a bunch of different ways; One moment, you'll be laughing at the absurdity of one segment of a man trying to pay the debts of a couple gangsters; The next, being enthralled by intense action and sociopolitical messages of a futuristic Korea ruled by ruthless capitalism and extremely bright scenery. It all paints the way for a sprawling, fantastical and massive story.<br /><br />The film is has about 6 different stories going on at the same time, from decade to decade to century, etc. All of the film's stories are interconnected in someway, shape or form. One person's life is read in another decade while another's actions are seen as heroics and godly-like worship. Reincarnation is the name of the game and the film has a field day with this subject. The order of the segments is as follows (which is also lovingly introduced to the audience in an ordered manner) :<br /><br />The Pacific Journal of Adam Ewing: The story of a dying man (Jim Sturgess) traveling from New Zealand to the United States while dealing with a parasite that's killing him, his doctor (Tom Hanks) and a black stowaway (David Gyasi) he becomes buds with. This story is set in 1859.<br /><br />Letters From Zedelghem: Robert Frobisher (Ben Whishaw), a bisexual composer, works with a aging musician (Jim Broadbent) to help him compose new music, which leads us to the film's musical motif, The Cloud Atlas Sextet. This story is set in 1931.<br /><br />Half-Lives: The First Luisa Rey Mystery: Luisa Rey (Halle Berry) is a reporter for a small time magazine and soon finds her self in a corporate conspiracy that could cost her life. This story is set 1973.<br /><br />The Ghastly Ordeal of Timothy Cavendish: A publisher (Jim Broadbent) finds himself dealing with psychotic gangsters and an oppressive retirement home in an attempt to pay off a couple of debts and reunite with the love of his life (Susan Sarandon). This story is 2012.<br /><br />An Orison of Sonmi-451: A Brave New World meets Blade Runner story about a clone (Doona Bae) who works at a McDonald's-esque restaurant and becomes friends with a freedom fighter (Jim Sturgess). This story takes place in 2144.<br /><br />Sloosha's Crossin' an' Ev'rythin After: Set 106 years after to Sonmi-451 segment (and apparently after the end of the world), this one tells the tale of a native named Zachry (Tom Hanks) and his life with a tribe on the islands of Hawaii. He also meets a woman named Meronym (Halle Berry), a member from a sec of technologically advanced humans that observes the villagers from time to time.<br /><br />If there was ever a word to describe Atlas, it would most certainly be ambitious.The sheer scale of the film and its cast brings to mind the great big blockbusters you'd see in the summer movie season, rather than an Oscar film. There's a wealth of things for the audience to experience here, even with its all over the place narrative. For an almost three hour film, the film moves by awfully quickly. There's almost never dull moment, with each segment constantly showing you something new and never slowing down.<br /><br />However, as much as I like this bold perspective, it does come with some problems. At times, I would almost wish the film would abandon its way and just play the segments individually or at least playing them in massive chunks rather than what I see here. It can end up slightly ruining the moment of one part, in which I feel like I'm forced to switch from feeling tearful and weary to excited in a minute.<br /><br />Acting wise, everyone in the film is giving their all and its surprising to see actors play people we would never expect to see them do in a million years. Would you ever expect Tom Hanks to play an unpleasant Cockney gangster or an evil, greedy doctor? Or Hugh Grant play a corrupt executive or a cannibal tribesman? Course not, but its frankly miraculous to see everyone doing something different. And this is where the film's makeup comes into play, transforming actors into entirely different people. While some of it can look pretty obvious (the segments in Korea have attracted some backlash due to some of the Caucasian actors made to look Asian), most of the time, I'd find myself baffled at who was what, especially when the end credits reveals who played who.<br /><br />Outside of the makeup, the film itself is a technical and audio marvel, thanks to cinematographer John Toll (The Thin Red Line, Iron Man 3, The Last Samurai). The Korean segments in particular, are frankly astonishing to look at and the costume design is equally up to snuff. On the audio side of things, the magnificent score by director Tom Tykwer, Johnny Klimek and Reinhold Heil is something that sweeps the audience of its feet. The Cloud Atlas Sextet, the film's musical motif  shows in a bunch of different ways and I always find myself humming to its notes, inspiring a strange sense of hope and wonder.<br /><br />At times, Atlas can feel saccharine and sentimental with its themes (both literal and figuratively) and yet...there's a genuine feel of magic to the whole affair. When you laugh or yelp a squeal of excitement, it feels as it is earned, not forced, despite my aforementioned problems with the segment placement. It's a movie that deserves to be watched more than once, examined and thought about. It's a film that can be and will be argued till the end of time of its merits, whether it'd be seen as a masterpiece or a disaster. And you know what?<br /><br />I'm actually okay with that.<br /><br />And to cap of this review, I leave you with this quote from the main character of the Timothy Cavendish story:<br /><br />\\"While my extensive experience as an editor has ledd me to a disdain for flashbacks and flash forwards and all such tricksy gimmicks I believe that if you, dear Reader, can extend your patience for just a moment, you will find that there is a Method to this tale of Madness.\\"Doona Bae) who works at a McDonald's-esque restaurant and becomes friends with a freedom fighter (Jim Sturgess).

B005B0QYMM|3.0|This film parodies Ghost Adventures. The actor playing Lance Preston does a good job. His character is based on Zak Bagans. Plenty of scares in store. You must see the sequel. Check out V/H/S on dvd and V/H/S/2 in cinemas later this year.
B004G5ZY7E|5.0|I'm a big fan of Nesbo, but this book is a masterpiece, even for him. It will scare the pants off of you. Of the 7 books of his I've read, this is head and shoulders above the rest (and they are all excellent too!); for that matter, The Snowman is head and shoulders above almost every thriller I've ever read. Someone better make this film, and fast (and it better be great!).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A story with lots of sadness yet very attention grabbing. Even tho it is a novel it has many similarities to life's twists & turns.

B001BKVWYG|5.0|This is an amazing artist, I almost didn't purchase for fear of him not receiving royalties from the industry who robbed him.
1451629192|5.0|This was a very detailed book about Jaycee's 18 years in captivity. I am amazed at the bravery and survival instincts of this 11 year old girl. I cried during the first half of the book. I just can not imagine how she felt. I think it is a tragedy that parole officers basically turned a blind eye. She should have been rescued very early on. I pray for her and her daughters and can't get Jaycee out of my head. I have an 11 year old daughter and My heart aches for her!

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Great series. I was able to watch the entire season in its complete form through Amazon Prime with relative ease.
B000053VBL|3.0|Trying to be an homage to Alfred Hitchcock.  Other than the music, not very close.  Too many coincidences stretch belief.  And absolutely ruined by the casting of Jeanne Moreau as the \\"young\\" bride.  She looks about 10 years older than the part.  And too unattractive to have all these men after her.  Her face was like that of a sad bulldog.

0316228532|5.0|Yes, I loved the Harry Potter books.  But what a complete change with this well-written adult novel.  Rowling's prose is flawless, and her stories entertwine in the most unique ways.  This tale of what happens to a community upon the death of one individual includes hope, tragedy, responsibility, and again, hope.  I loved this novel.
B002UTKSBK|4.0|Most of you are probably like me in that you have never experienced loving every single song in an album. This is the case with this album, too. It's great music--obviously!! I just can't handle too much dark music, so I like to listen to probably about 5 or 6 of the songs.
B006X5L6VS|3.0|When I got it for my kindle I didn't know I also needed<br />a GPS to work with it.  So I haven't used it.
B002NZK5QY|3.0|I had to buy this movie so I could watch it for a college class because there is no longer movie rental places around here and the library only had one copy of this which was already checked out.  For the price it was great, but it isn't a movie I would want to watch over and over again so I plan to donate it to my local library.
125000098X|5.0|can not wait for the next installment !! I had a waiting list of friends who all wanted to be the first to borrow my copy.
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|The plot line is really interesting and the whole story is thought-provoking. Emma Stone (and every other actor/actress) is fabulous in this movie. I wholeheartedly recommend it. I plan to read the book!!
B000002VRZ|5.0|The Outlaws first paycheck for playing on stage was at the Whipping Post, 14727, N. Florida Ave., Tampa. Hughie's street name was \\"Buster.\\" Billy was a close friend. I owned the Whipping Post, rehabbed it, gutted it and wound up with a tight recording studio quality band room in the back. Cecil Law, did the stucco outside and all the carpentry trim inside. Lew Stusak made the new booths. Later after the band broke apart, Monte Yohoo would come in through the doors, with his drum set on wheelies, and jam out. Henry Paul used to drop in after closing hour with a few lady friends in tow, and drink my Heinekins, lol. Was proud to stand near the stage at House of Blues, Orlando, and see the last great show by everyone except my good friend Billy Jones. I was in the music business, ran concerts in the late 70's for Margie Sexton of Gulf Artists with former White Witch keyboardist Buddy Pendergrass, now deceased (Moffet Cancer Center, Tampa, Fl.) The  loss of all Southern Rock pains me, as I've known Doug Gray of MTB for decades, yet never asked for a tambourine!<br />The Outlaws, lacked the writing creativity to keep the band fresh, and soon, disco crap took over anyway, everyone put down their Zig Zags, cowboy hats and jeans, donned high heels and began snorting the white powder and dancing to a DJ in a place filled with strobes and lights. Trovolta sealed the deal. We were \\"saved\\" in the early 80's by MTV! It was a painful transition and cost us so many many great, musically talented bands.<br />It pains me to see country acts, canned sound the same crap off the inventory shelves from Nashville, as the folks in the biz now lament \\"everyone is booting our music and not buying the CD's.\\" If it wasn't for those 99 cent single song downloads, they'd starve to death. The money now is in touring, not in record shops.<br />Few knew Billy Jones was a gifted USF math major! May all those who left us too early, from the Caldwells of MTB, to the Allman Bros., to  the Outlaws and Skynyrd, you can bet they are all together, jamming like those great moments, when the energy fed the priceless moment, strings smoked and amps melted down.<br />There will Never be a period like that again, they just don't make em' like they used to!<br />I will say this though, many many bar bands went through the cover music circuit playing other bands hit music, playing the bars and clubs, BUT NO ONE, AND I MEAN NO ONE, EVER, TOOK ON GREEN GRASS AND HIGH TIDES!<br />I saw the Outlaws at the Bayfront Center in St. Pete, Fl. on New Years eve, I believe in 1979, I timed them, looking at my watch, and they burned Green Grass and High Times for an awesome 32 minutes! Surreal! God Bless and Rest In Peace, the FLORIDA GUITAR ARMY! Only Henry Paul and Monte remain of the original group. So sad.<br />I recall being with them when they first hit it big on their first album, going to Peaches Records and Tapes in Clearwater, Fl. for the album's promo, sponsored by 98 Rock (97.9 FM) Tampa Bay Area. What a special day and moment. They paid their dues and earned their place in Southern Rock History.<br />I'd like to recognize a special unique true gift they brought to their fans, the blending, tightness and amplitudinal harmonies inter-twined with three lead guitars. Only a true musician could appreciate the talent, energy and creativity they delivered in those precious moments. I often wondered how the schematics back on the mixing boards would have looked like from a purely mathematical perspective! Awesome, just outright awesome!
1457514508|5.0|Here's a fun read that becomes a perfect storm of suspects.  This rich murder pot-boiler is endearingly Miss. Marpel-esque in its pace and a Goodread's finalist for 2013 Readers' Favorite in the humor category.  I hope it wins.<br /><br />English author Whitehead does crime in an off-handed character-driven was that is charming and filled with gentility.  Laps around a dog-walker's park lead to Argentina and Paris and red herrings galore.  Some of the characters deserve Spanish Moss growing in their hair.  So join the Club. Huzzah for Whitehead. More please.  5 Stars.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|Glad to know I can reach facebook from my kindle. I go to the beach almost every weekend and love to be able to reach facebook without having to carry any laptop at all.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|Great tie-in to the modern digital equivalent of my childhood favorite toy!  Once in a while, I'll even let my kid play with it!
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have kind of an off brand so I was glad when this worked, glad i have my kindle :)
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I've had this app on my Kindle HD for a while. Prior to the latest update, I wasn't impressed because the &quot;current&quot;weather report was always from at least an hour earlier.  That seems to have been fixed with the latest update, but after a few days use, I still find the current layout a poorly organized mess.  I have the Weather Channel App on an iPod and have no complaints.....I wish someone would create a similar app for Androids.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Really fun game and challenging as well.  If you stick with it,  you'll eventually get it. Agree it's not like 100 floors and that's a good thing! Looking forward to the new levels!!
B00CL68QVQ|5.0|This is an excellent story with complex characters. It is a very realistic picture of a dysfunctional family. Every member has baggage or issues which affect the others, siblings push each others buttons and play their good kid, bad kid roles expertly.
B002OR0RP0|4.0|My 7 & 10 yr old grandchildren & I watched this for the 3rd time. It is very cute with nothing offensive whatsoever.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Truly awesome! Loving this game! Great way to relax after a stressful day. I would highly recommend this game for everyone!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Enjoyed the plot.  How life changers for the characters and the love the grows between them.  Sometimes a person needs to escape and you can while reading this book!
1416524800|5.0|I read this book while on vacation and it was so fun to read.  I almost couldn't put it down.  A highly recommended summer thriller!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina did a great job at capturing her audience. There was not one part that I didn't laugh out loud at. You feel a real connection to her while reading because her stories are about everyday things, just retold in a sarcastic, dry, hilarious way. Would definitely recommend this to all.
B001P06GX4|5.0|Very addictive game. There is a strategy to win, and we're still trying to figure it out. All skill levels will love this game.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Very good read.  Well written with twists and turns that keep you guessing!  Sometimes it's just good for a person to drift away in to a good book!
B007QDNKQA|5.0|It kept my attention through out the movie, riveting. It has a great script, my hat off to the writers.
B00DMF8PCK|4.0|My son is 4 years old and loves bugs and goofy adventures. I purchased the instant video with fun memories having seen it in the theatre a LONG time ago, and watched it with him. He loved it! It will be a family &#34;classic&#34; in our house!
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|My favorite tv program. I just love to watch Mike and Harvey at work. They make a great team. Looking forward to season 3.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|i really enjoyed  this fun and diffrrnt game i wish i had played it sonner please donload its really fun.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I thought this movie was absolutely adorable. It is not just a movie for kids. Adults just like myself and boyfriend would really enjoy this family friendly movie.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's always great to find a &#34;new&#34; show and this is it for us! Fun, intelligent, thrilling--reminds me of &#34;Damages,&#34; with a softer edge...so far.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Needs more levels but very addictive. Hard at first but can follow quickly . Once they add more than 10 levels I know I will play non stop.
B000FDECGA|5.0|This was one of the first Samurai movies I've seen in my life. It made me interested in Samurai movies and also made me embrace my early Japanese roots.
B007UR1OHO|5.0|Excellent movie. I absolutely love Channing Tatum and Rachel McAdams. I love the love story and the fact that it's based on a true story.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|ITs such an addicting game!!! I loveit so so so much!! Ans it was a steal for .99$!!! If you know this game, get it!
1608871827|5.0|Definitely the best film by Guillermo Del Toro, and this book is incredible, if you want to buy a good book Monsters Vs Robots, this is appropriate.<br />Totally recommended ...
B000025JMP|5.0|Great CD.  Shows Elvis funny side and serious side.  Was a awesome movie and CD.  Songs are of the concert years!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|After I finished the second book, I had to start this one to see what happens! I had an extremely hard time putting it down! All three books area must read! Loved them!!
B0036EH3WU|5.0|I really enjoy it.  I like fantasy and this keeps me wanting to watch the next episode as soon as I can.
B00470TOV0|5.0|I named my dog maximus decimus miriduis call him Max. And I will name my first son Arelius because of this movie alone. This movie makes 300 look like a joke.... not kidding. People might not agree but that is just because they are from an obtuse nescient terrible generation that I unfortunately happen to be from to the point where nescient is saying that it is spelled incorrectly. Point made.... game blouses...<br /><br />The end.<br /><br />For those of you who need to google the words I am using just give up and agree.... or learn good film making ... The end part II...
B00594XOZU|5.0|I need the update because I can't watch videos, can't use links and I can't even look at pictures but otherwise I love it.
140006922X|4.0|I heard Reza Aslan on NPR and bought the book.  His title argues that Jesus' words indicate he was a Zealot, though not in the traditional sense of a violent radical.  Radical, perhaps, but not violent. Reza Aslan sounds sincere when talking about his own conversion experience.  He knows how to lay out the Gospel in a nutshell.  His insights into Jesus' answering the question about who owns Roman money with....\\"give back to God that which is God's\\" and calling the current accepted interpretation... a type of \\"milquetoast\\" contortion...then grounding his analysis in the Greek....is powerful.  He believes Jesus was saying that God owns it all and while some may think that this is pushing the Christian faith toward a more acceptable form that's more palatable to Islam, Islam is still as divided as some Protestants and Catholics!<br /><br />Aslan's interpretation of the Caesar's face the coin parallels the \\"camel through the eye of the needle\\" story that most modern preachers interpret with the camel contorting to pass through a small door in the larger gate of the city that didn't exist when Jesus told the story.  Sorry mythologizers who want like a genuflecting camel to humbly pass into heaven based on their humility.  Not an option!  It was really a sewing needle and an impossible task, save for \\"what is impossible for man in possible with God.\\"  All monotheists should find this refreshing.<br /><br />So, I guess, given the current state of affairs I have to say \\"what's wrong with this guy's refreshing and insightful resistance to empire when two time Congressional Medal of Honor winner, Smedley Darlington Butler, a Quaker, asked the same question about following ancient Rome's example?\\" Jewish Zealots distrusted all empires and were anti-pyramidal....save for the handful that didn't join Moses in the wilderness and remained to polish Pharoah's sandals instead of living free.<br /><br />Christianity like every other religion has laid myth upon myth which is why the Bible has to be read and reread.<br /><br />I was listening to Shelby Foote the Civil War historian interviewed by Bill Moyers.  He told Moyers he used no original documents in his research.....\\"it's all been gone over before,\\" said Foote to my horror and disbelief.  Neither can we read original documents, but for a different reason than Foote.  They don't exist, only the copies.<br /><br />Sorry Billy Graham and Charles Schuler.  Sorry Karl Barth and Paul Tillich.  Sorry Lester Roloff and Jim Jones, David Koresh and Pope Fransis.....Martin Luther and all the rest....fresh truth still shouts out to be heard.<br /><br />I'm banking on Revelation....that Jesus wins.  I'm also banking....after this weeks Trayvon Martine/Zimmerman case on some scriptures that Reza Aslan might also enjoy interpreting....\\"In Christ there's neither East nor West,  Jew nor Greek, Slave nor free, male nor female,\\" and ......\\"Greater things will you do than I have done,\\".......those ought to keep us busy for a while.
B003TSEL7S|5.0|Sweet I like it it had a lot of detail about it and the end was amazing it was great
B008NCSZQ8|2.0|Avengers was never my favorite comic; I was more into Spider-Man and Fantastic Four. But I enjoyed a few of their comic books once upon a time. This movie, however, simply didn't work. I would be happy to accept any one character's backstory. But to accept such a huge number of contradictory and nonsensical origin stories was beyond me. Maybe if some of the characters had the opportunity to develop, I could get past this. But between the large number of characters and the huge number of extended fight scenes where various good and bad guys delivered killing blows that had no lasting effect, there was no time to get to know any of the characters.
B00AB7HESI|3.0|Why should you have to pay after you all ready did once and there weren't that many levels other than that it was pretty fun
B00A8ECU24|4.0|Only problem - I bought gems and I did not get them, I contacted customer service got one reply, provided the info needed but nothing happened. Still waiting to hear from them :(
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a good game it's just a little glitch but I recommend it for all horse lovers I love and I think whoever plays it will to
B002MCYWHG|5.0|Great design, even when I'm 6'1&#34; I could ride my bike without problem, and the good thing is I was always talking with my little child, other advantage is the pad in the front my kid fell sleep and it was pretty comfortable, It worth it!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|This app is awesome I Love it personally I think it is the best Disney app ever the only thing is that I wish you could be Glinda but maybe soon &lt;3
B001G70M6S|5.0|My husband and I found a near mint condition Polaroid Land Camera while on vacation this Spring. I was worried about finding film that was affordable, but this works like a charm. There is a bit of a learning curve, but the print quality is great,
B00AREIAI8|4.0|I don't exactly care for virtual world apps but this app is pretty good. The only thing wrong with the app is the energy running out and having to wait to play again.but other than that is awesome.
B00CISC2DA|5.0|This is exactly what I was looking for.  Dark & rather moody, but not overwhelmingly so.  Very much enjoy this cd.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|This game is short but it is extremely entertaining. It is a great way to get your mind racing. Lots of fun
B001BKVWYG|5.0|Mr. Rodriguez is a very talented artist/singer/song writer.  He is amazing and is from Michigan, all the better to love his music.  Thank you to another country for recognizing him and for the people who found him and have given him the credit he deserves.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game all ages can play .I'm in love with this game I think you should get the game if you haven't.
B00C2GJWNG|5.0|This is such a great album - every single song is a hit!  I can't wait for his next one!
B0082XKGGU|3.0|But wasn't really sure if it was worth the $$$.  Always interesting though to have a look at other leaders.
B001TCHDPS|5.0|I watched the movie and then had to have the CDs.  Thank you Mr. Rodriguez for your talent and inspiration.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for kids and adults it teaches kids how to take care of animals and teaches them responsibility and it is really fun.
B00992CF6W|5.0|THIS Game is worth the money<br />Build anything you want!!!!<br />I got this for my son ander he loves it
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book will change your life FOREVER.  ALL we need to do is learn to love ourselves, only then can we love others and by being true to ourselves we will find happiness by living OUR life not one that pleases others at the cost of our own happiness.  This is a must read for EVERYONE.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Awesome!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This game is great even the free content as soon as I can I will buy the full version
B00DXLO0D6|3.0|From TV Shows on DVD: \\"Late in 2008, almost five years ago now, Sony put out an I Dream of Jeannie - The Complete Series DVD gift set, complete with \\"bottle\\" packaging. This item's been discontinued, however, so on October 15th Sony Pictures Home Entertainment will re-release I Dream of Jeannie - The Complete Series, in slimmer \\"unlimited\\" packaging that's more conventional in look (and shelf fit)...it will come with the same 20 DVDs which the previous set included, and with all the same on-disc content as well (extras and all, we're told, which means that it's the same Pilot Episode Audio Commentary and Cast Interviews found on the Season 1 set, since the 2nd through 5th season sets had no extras). Unfortunately it does NOT seem to include the two post-series telefilms (1985's \\"I Dream of Jeannie: 15 Years Later,\\" separately available as a MOD (manufacture on demand) DVD, and 1991's \\"I Still Dream of Jeannie,\\" which is still not available on DVD yet); it's just the 5 seasons that aired for the show's original broadcast.\\"
B00C7O8MJ8|4.0|Soundtrack lacks the depth of emotion I had hoped for but I'm glad I own it. It's good. Try it.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|Basic plot structure is similar.  Francis Underwood is slightly less comic than Francis Urqhart, but both can be really sinister.  Robin Wright is spectacular.  Just try to keep in mind that she was &#34;The Princess Bride&#34;.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is amazing. If I could play this game 24 hours a day I would. I want to see more of this game.
B004DLPXAO|3.0|I've been using the Kindle App for nearly 2 years.  Over this time it has steadily gotten worse with every update.  It now has ads, it is significantly slower (5+ seconds after clicking before it opens), and it does NOT sync with new books that you buy.  In order to get new books, I now have to pretend to buy it again and wait for it to say \\"oh hey, you already bought this!\\" and use the \\"download now\\" link from that, when before it was a simple sync to available books, select book you want to read.  Half the time I have to download books multiple times because Kindle just loses the one I was reading an hour ago!<br /><br />Please Amazon, take out all of the slow useless updates and return to the code you were using 2 years ago that worked, was fast, and sync'd correctly.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|Essential to those who enjoy Hans Zimmer. Emotional depth. Not John Williams...different. A lot of music - good music - for the money
B00847KFDS|5.0|This album once again proves that John Fogerty is one of the best song writers during the past 30-35 years. The songs are catchy, the melodies are great, and the remakes of classics add something new to the mix. I sort of like the originals better, but the remakes of Proud Mary and Bad Moon Rising reflect continued creativity.
B008LZHA3G|5.0|Sometimes Dylan makes a good album, but this time he knocked it out of the park.<br />The tempest song is a readymade classic, and the  band is spot on.
B00BFUUMO8|4.0|Love this game. A fun way to just chill out. Wish it was a little easier to get coins for feeding as well as getting new dinos. But fun none the less
B000002H5I|5.0|I think one aspect of this album that makes it so special is how easy it is to connect to the sound and the lyrics.  It's so relate-able, human and genuine.  I felt like she sang from her soul, and touched mine.
B00BTHWFBK|4.0|This is a really, really good Sabbath album. It is everything you want, dark, heavy, evil. The songs are not uptempo but slower and very heavy. Ozzy sounds great, and of course the lyrics are pure evil ('is God dead?'). Sabbath fans will not be disappointed with this reunion album sans Bill Ward. The album is a throwback to the early days when Sabbath ruled heavy metal. Buy it.
B0087JTAKW|5.0|I enjoy reading Mitch Albom's novels because they cause me to reflect on my life. After reading The Timekeeper, I have found how much we allow ourselves to be ruled by time instead of just living the day as much as possible.  I look forward to Albom's next creation.
B00DBSZEH2|1.0|This was like a B movie that was trying really hard to not be one, the end result was ridiculously painful to watch cinematic trash - the only reason we finished it was because we'd already paid and were making bets on how much worse it could get.
0385349831|4.0|I never had any eye-opening moments, but I enjoyed it and related to it along the way.  I think this would make a good gift too.
1781162646|2.0|This is Stephen King lite, and I think, somewhat intentionally so....it's marketed pretty much that way, with the paperback-only option; with the misleading pulp cover photo, and what not....it's well-written enough, mostly. The thing is, it has some of the typical SK foreboding, but it never develops a fever pitch. The whole book is kind of mezzo-piano- even the so-called climax. Still, I was fully prepared to give it three stars as a pleasant enough read with some nice, well-written moments. And then, in the last few pages, Stephen committed one of my pet peeves- injecting his views on contemporary politics into a work of fiction- out of the blue- apropos of nothing.  He laments that Dick Cheney has survived his heart disease while good men (Clarence Clemmons) have died. That sort of comparison is supposed to use people who are universally considered to be evil. Dick Cheney is considered evil by people who consider their opinions to be facts. John Irving did the same thing in \\"Owen Meany\\", and to me, it really cheapened him as a literary figure. Stephen King isn't quite a literary figure, but he is a very good writer, betimes. But he stepped out from behind the curtain in the last chapter to fire a cheap political shot.
B00BHMF578|5.0|It was a great movie and lived up to my expectations. I was sceptical after all the Oscar hype that had built up but it was truly a fun movie to watch. having young kids, I tend to sleep within half an hour of any movie (sad, I know) but this time I stayed up and watched the whole thing. Great movie night movie.
1402593872|4.0|The book itself is, of course, a great listen, and the fact that it was a used library rental did not faze me, but the price was a bit overboard for something that was obviously used quite a bit. But it was what I wanted and it was what I expected since it is so hard to get.
B00DFRVAC2|4.0|You get what you pay for with this soundtrack and that is a hard riff belting homage to Kaijiu movies of the past. The main theme rocks enough for you to turn it up on the treadmill and the 2500 tons of awesome and the gypsy danger theme drive it home.<br />It's great. I must have for any Big Budget soundtrack collector, An instant classic.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|Although there was much tragedy and death during this Season, it was by far the most gripping, engrossing one yet!  Can't wait for Season 4!!!
B005T9ZTSU|3.0|I really don't use it much.  I prefer Picasa and now find my camera phone stuffing all the pictures into Drop Box with no effort on my part.  However, I was born when Herbert Hoover was  president and my  technology reviews on anything that doesn't really simplify my life aren't too useful.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is a fun game I recommend it for children but you can do it at any age but I don't like that you have to unlock the characters it's already challenging.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|it is a really fun game to play when you are bored to death in your house you will get addicted to this game
B0054LJGWS|4.0|I read this for a book club at work, and I was pleased with the choice. The British references were a bit hard to follow at first, but I got used to it after a while. It was a very humorous take on Good vs Evil, the ultimate battle, aka Armageddon.  I liked the way the authors humanized demons and angels, made social and religious commentary, and got philosophical all while making you laugh.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft and this is definitely worth the money but i wish kindles could host lan and also get updates alot faster but other than that th is is the best app ever
B003FFEX8C|5.0|Should have done better at the box office would love to have seeing a second one, A must see if your a super hero fan.
B0056JJXOO|5.0|Makes you remember what teenage love is all about  how two families could not get alone and they lost bothe their children
1455508977|2.0|If you have never read a book by Nicholas Sparks, please do not start with this book. I have read 13 of his novels and this was by far my least favorite.  Like his other writings, Sparks had me hooked from the beginning and I looked forward to reading this story. About halfway through, the story became slow and less intriguing. I went ahead and finished reading the book and was very let down. It felt as though Sparks either lost interest in the story, or was on a deadline and wrapped up the story without much thought put into it. This is not his best work and I am happy I borrowed it from someone. Had I added it to my collection of Nicholas Sparks books before reading it, I would have been upset I paid for it.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love this app so much! But sometimes after you build a house and what not, then you don't really know what to to afterwards. And there needs to be more updates!
B0099RFVXQ|1.0|This movie is in a category that irks me. I can't figure out why a studio would spend so much money making a movie and release it with such poor sound quality. It seemed like the more I turned up the volume the softer the actors spoke. Then something would happen in the movie that had sound so loud I would have to grab the remote and quickly turn it down only to turn it back up in a few seconds to try to hear the dialog. Finally I gave up and turned it off.
B00DGMVJAO|4.0|Jack is a very good family themed movie! Lot's of action, and fun for the whole family. . . .do rent or buy this film; it's a winner!
B00CFQMVLS|4.0|Overall,  I liked the movie. It is a typical DIE HARD Movie, with lots of action, and John McClain bleeding all over the place. And the place is Russia,  I was thinking that they had done everything with the DIE HARD Movies, I was wrong, they went to Russia! The first 15 - 20 minutes, or so is SLOW, waiting for the action. But when it starts it does not stop, you go from one gunfight to the next. There were some new action sequences that have not been seen before, One thing however, The story is a little hard to follow, you really have to pay attention, if you miss a minute or two you're lost. I give it a 4 out of 5. Definitly worth watching!
B008OOYALE|1.0|Anything you want to do in this game requires a simple selection action and then hours or even days to be completed. Want to go faster? Be prepared to spend a lot of real money. The  dragons are a little cute but they just bounce around in their stupid tiny enclosures.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and buy Animal Crossing: New Leaf. It's $35 but then you never need to spend another penny.<br /><br />The final straw for me is that many features are only available on iTS and will probably never make it to android devices.
B004SJ3AXI|1.0|I could not play the game for all the interruptions of it trying to sell me something. It's free because it is an ad.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Love it so much but it laggs a lot for me so fix that for me and I will give you a higher rating ok but I still love it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Interesting look into a way of life, long forgotten. Iots of interesting twists and surprises. ran't wait to see how they are developed next season.
B00821PCJS|4.0|It started out a little slow but once I became familiar with all the characters, I really liked it. Good stories and the CG are great.
B0000VD04M|3.0|it's classic Johnny Depp.  The lines are so deadpan you have to laugh outloud.  Some may not &#34;get it.&#34;  Very tongue-in-cheek.  Makes you appreciate Ed Wood.  Mine arrived in a damaged cover, but DVD was ok.
B0026QC0TA|4.0|Even though we always know who the good guys are in this movie, the subtext --- that even the good guys have to do questionable things in order to see justice done --- creates some complexity and interest. Excellent cast, great cinematography, compelling to watch, rings true. The intense emotional connection between lawyer and client is explored here --- something that probably happens with some frequency but is rarely portrayed in film.
B003ZSJ212|4.0|I did not like the packaging I thought that it was a bit cheap. Sound quality is great the changes to the movies did not bother me as much as it did others.
B0002F6AH0|4.0|Remembered watching these when I was young, so enjoy watching them again and listening to Lawrence Olivier's narration.  One thing I noticed, now that I'm older (maybe not wiser) and know more about WWII, etc.  there are some areas of the war, politics, etc that could have been gone into much more deeply.  For example, at this point in rewatching (I'm only up to disc 3), there isn't that much on Hitler's motives, plans, etc.  That would make it much more interesting.
1603425381|5.0|I used several of these Borders on the new Afghans that I made.  I even tried several samples that were fun.
B005LAIH2M|2.0|I could not believe that some of these professional actors and actressess agreed to be in this movie. It was just horrible; I found myself stunned (in a bad way) by the set design. I would recommend passing this movie because it seems like a very low budget film trying to ride the wake which other vampire/monster movies created lately.
B000002UZ1|5.0|1967–1970 (widely known as &#34;The Blue Album&#34;) is a compilation of songs by the English rock band The Beatles, spanning the years indicated in the title. It was released with 1962–1966 (&#34;The Red Album&#34;), in 1973. 1967–1970 made number 1 on the American Billboard chart and number 2 on the British Album Chart. This album was re-released in September 1993 on compact disc, charting at number 4 in the United Kingdom.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game and very challenging, great for adults and kids. It starts out easy and gets harder as you advance levels. You need to search for various colors and or number clues to open safes and drawers to get keys. You want to ultimately find the code or key to open the elevator door to advance.
0738212415|5.0|This is by far my favorite drawing book so far. My whole family is artistic. Except me. I honestly didn't think I could draw but with Mark's simple directions and fun exercises anyone (myself included) can draw!
B0090SI4OC|4.0|I loved but like many have said they did change some things but that almost always happens. But I can understand it because they do have to shorten it because you don't want people losing interest. I am a twi-hard and have read all of stephanie meyers books. And am a big fan of her and if they make more to the host I will definetly watch them. You can't expect every movie be perfect with their books. They do have to shorten it and a lot of the peices of the books will get left out. All the actors did a great job at pertraying the characters. Although I do agree that sometimes when they melany would talk she came across like a 14 year old girl. And I love emily browning portraying the new host wanda enhabited. As for a movie I think they did a great job and went very well with the book and still keeping it interesting and not getting boring. Loved adding this to my blu ray collection.
B00CKJTOHO|4.0|Changing the formula realy makes the show suffer. Stay with what works, I think the show is really winding down!
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is fun to play on my Kindle Fire and not have to deal out the cards!  The game actually retaught me the real rules of Solitaire!
B0083SBJXS|4.0|good Movie, lots of action and good special effects.  bought it as a present for my son (9), and he was happy.
B007C7UZIG|4.0|The Steam app is, for the most part, great. You can get games, update (parts) of your profile, and change security/account settings, all on the go. The problem is, there is no community tab. That means you cannot go to the forums, community markets, or workshop. Along with that, anything related to community (trading cards, profile backgrounds, etc...) cannot be accessed. This app works fine for most stuff, but since it is incomplete i took off a star. If you have a steam account and a mobile device, you need to get this app.
B000JQUKKU|5.0|This is a classic that every one should read. While Dickens' humiliating childhood experiences are not directly described in A Christmas Carol, his conflicting feelings for his father as a result of those experiences are principally responsible for the dual personality of the tale's protagonist, Ebenezer Scrooge
B0095MVOMC|3.0|It's an interesting concept for a different kind of hidden object game. There were some pretty scenes in the first several levels, but it got really repetitive quickly. Some of the scenes looked very much alike and some were just different angles of the same city-scapes. It would have been a big improvement if there were different scenes, instead of city-scape after city-scape, a couple interior rooms, and a few piles of fruits and veggies. I got through the entire game pretty quickly. Might be worth $1, so pick it up on sale.
B005LAIHZY|5.0|My daughter loves this movie, and it is great that Merida isn't a push over like many other disney princesses.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is a good book for children. I like it because it is sometimes funny! Diaries are good to write!
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Good pricing and good quality. Son loved it. Good for birthday gifts or Christmas presents. May consider buying other Nerf in future
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|Normally, if you asked me, \\"hey I have the new American Idol's winner's cd, wanna listen to it?\\"  I would say, HELL NO!  However, I really enjoy Phillip Phillips music.  He reminds me of a twangy version of ColdPlay or Keane, and his songs definitely have that \\"get stuck in your head\\" quality.  He is much different than other \\"pop\\" stars because he can actually play an instrument, which is a big plus.
B009KHCT94|2.0|I agree with the reviews that compare the satire to \\"The Rocky Horror Picture Show\\" but, it was no where near as funny.  I just don't like political satire that demonizes one political prospective. If the movie used the Clinton's or Obama instead I would have still given it the same low rating. Really, an evil ambitious Sarah Palin vs Nazis??? Sorry, I don't see the humor.<br /><br />The only reason I give this movie two stars is due to great special effects.<br /><br />If you're looking for good believable sci-fi this is not it!<br /><br />Rent or wait until you can view it for free but don't waste your money buying it.
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|hyelllll<br />I cant stop playing or else ill never win battles arggghhhhh what the fauark this is an aggravating game
B007F5SG22|5.0|Are you interested in knowing what it is like growing up in a tribal society? The first half of this brilliant autobiography describes in the author's personal experiences growing up in Somalia, bound by tribal ties. She also describes her personal engagement with Islam.<br /><br />Are you interesting in knowing about the experience of radical displacement felt in running away from home and going to a totally foreign place? The second half of the book reports the author's experience as a refugee in Holland, and her growing concern with the human rights of Muslim women.<br /><br />To my mind, this is one of the most informative and honest accounts of both tribal society and the refugee experience. I have assigned it to my anthropology students, and recommend it to all.
0061478784|5.0|'Howl's Moving Castle' is a wonderful fairy tale story that somewhat resembles the animated Studio Ghibli/Disney film of the same name.  Since I watched the film version before reading the book, its hard to review the book without comparing the two.  The story is told in the 3rd person narrative, from the point of view of Sofie Hatter, who has a curse placed upon her by the Witch of the Waste, and seeks the aid of the Wizard Howl to remove it. If possible, the book is actually a little light-hearted compared the movie, in which the war and love story are played up much more.  Most would consider this book a pretty light read for an adult but, none the less, it is a page turner especially towards the end.  The ending is a little flat compared to the film, mostly, like stating before, because the themes of war and love are not central to the book, so in the end, the book focusses mostly on the final battle between the Wizard and the Witch.  Also, the \\"they lived happily ever after\\" cliched ending is twisted a bit in the book.  All in all, this is a great read, and a nice introduction to this series, as well as the other writings of the recently deceased Diana Wynne Jones.
B00821OX98|5.0|Great show, very realistic premise and great plot as well as great visual effects. Can't wait to start season 2!
B007TNS6JI|5.0|One of the best games I've ever downloaded but I just wish the range weapons were a little more easy to use.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|As a college student that walks to class everyday this app has been a life saver! Now I can check my specific location and not have to worry about sudden torrential downpours
030758836X|1.0|Horrible predictable cliche of a book. So disappointed. And stupid ending to boot. Plot device was so obvious that I thought it must be the author was doing it on purpose, as a red herring, (the reviews were so great that I assumed a plot device so obvious must mean there was a triple twist ending, so I slogged on.) Nope, no surprises. What a waste.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is so fun and addictive. great time passer! it has awesome graphics and is very easy to steer. I cant think of anything bad about this game:) you should definitely get it. it is great for all ages!!:D
B000K7VHQ4|5.0|We need more well written, well acted, spellbinding stories such as this. This is fiction based on fact, but makes good use of historic evidence (the start of WWI).
0143118420|5.0|Great book.  Excellent writing.  Real page turner that I could not put down.  Enjoyed the descriptions and the adventures.  This is one to read again.
B00CHRB9RM|5.0|This album is truly a critical piece of music history and in light of what the band had been through a real accomplishment of spirit.  The 2 discs of the Winterland concert is worth the hefty price of admission.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|I forgot how much I loved to read until I sat down with this book today, I couldn't put it down.
B00A8OWOSO|5.0|I've been meaning to watch this for a very long time, and finally took the plunge the other night. This is by far the best character  Gabriel Byrne has portrayed in his extremely distinguished career. His roles have varied, from a priest to Satan (both in the same year), a Viking, a doctor, a criminal... you get the picture. Also great performances by Albert Finney, Marsha Gay Harding, and John Turturro. There are also two of my favorite actors in cameo roles; Michael Jeter and Steve Buscemi. If you haven't seen it, you need to - great movie!
1451695195|5.0|Great read.  Some terms used were difficult to understand, however, tied together very well.  Extremely interesting sequence of events.  Recommended to those facing life crisis.
B00C5W3SBE|1.0|This movie is unwatchable, unbearable, and is a brutal waste of time and money.  Nothing good to say about this.
B007THA4FI|3.0|I enjoyed the character descriptions. I found the subject matter and the subjects a bit morbid. That is not in line with what I usually enjoy reading, and it left me feeling empty and hopeless. I do think it is well written and would call it a literary novel. It defines a certain perspective on how the world works.
159463176X|5.0|I read all of Khaled Hosseini's books on a priority scale near the top. The minute he releases a new book, I'm in line. He speaks to the reader with the calm demeanor of a true mid-eastern storyteller. Like the Kite Runner, and A Thousand Splendid Suns, the Mountains Echoed has an uncanny way of making you want to get to the next page for more atmosphere, story line, and introduction of fascinatingly-detailed characters.  All of his books offer insight into a society little understood by westerners, and therefore I read his material as much for learning as for enjoyment.  After finishing ...And the Mountains Echoed, I find myself drawn to re-read chapters, which, to me, is the bar which is set toward understanding a realm I had never thought much about.  I won't divulge the story line. That is the enjoyment of reading the book. Just read it. You'll see.
0143118706|5.0|Great book.  Easy read.  Enjoyable author, who uses logic in her writing.  Truly a book I will keep and read again and again.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This game is so fun,I love it I really want to get coco from Paris edition.thank you for making this game it is really incredible
B006MW3V6U|5.0|I love both sets of characters and they make me feel like I know them and I end up caring about them.
B00CL0J99K|3.0|I give this movie 3 stars because as an action film it was pretty good.. and the acting was awesome.<br /><br />but i felt that this film was more of a Robert Downey Jr. action comedy, than it was an Iron Man movie.  for some that is fine.  for me, that is not why i watch comic book films.  i want a good story centered around Tony Stark and Iron Man Lore.  i want the bad guy to be compelling.  I want to see Tony Stark and Iron Man..  I want the die hard Iron Man fans to come out of that movie saying \\"WOW.  now THAT was Iron Man!\\".  Unfortunately, i didnt get that with this film.  I got a great action comedy with Robert Downey Jr. as the main character.  not once did i feel like i was watching Tony Stark or Iron Man.<br /><br />in my mind, this was a good action movie.. but not a good Iron Man.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|Fun but also irritating as heck. I still recommend that u get it (great game so get it and have fun and get irritated at the same time
B005WUHAX8|4.0|This case is much nicer than the huge Otter box....yes, there are a few hassles with using a headset, but oh, well...if you don't use a headset, this is the case for you....nice and slim...oh, and using the speakerphone is not good with it. It's based on reverberation of the back, for the sound...therefore, do not expect the speakerphone to be good. Love the weight and size.

B005LAII4E|4.0|GI Joe Retaliation is a good movie for what it is.  I really enjoyed it.  lots of good action scenes and it felt like I was watching another GI Joe episode.  if you are expecting some serious plot capable of winning best picture.. you're doing it wrong.  thats not what this film is, or should be about.  its about over the top action with some 80s GI Joe nostalgia mixed in.  and it delivered on that.<br /><br />the only downside.  no Rachel Nichols (the unbelievably gorgeous red head from the first film).
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Khaled Hosseini is a great writer who is becoming greater. This book is subtle and rich in imagery. Slowly<br />the web is spun and the characters are developed until the very end when the web is complete and Khaled the spider has us fully captivated in this magical web.<br />This is a novel that takes place on three continents and set in modern times within a modern events backdrop. The characters participate and interact with the unfolding of these events.<br />The characters are beautiful, complex individuals, full of pain and sorrow from their wounded pasts and the will to heal those wounds and become scarred but healed veterans of life in their own individual way.<br />Excellent book!
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Another page turner from Gillian Flynn!! Can't wait for her to write another one! Maybe based in St. Louis this time!

0440178002|5.0|In \\"Shogun\\", James Clavell tells the story of the first British sailor to arrive to the shores of Japan. (This character is loosely based on William Adams).  He arrives at the time of a dire power struggle between the two most powerful daimyos, Toranaga and Ishido. In between all of the flying arrows and sharp Samurai swords, John Blackthorne learns about Japanese culture, its language, and even embraces some Samurai customs, which not too long before seemed to him barbaric and cruel. This part was, in my opinion, the best. Clavell has brilliantly portrayed Blackthorne's slow adjustment to Japanese norms. It also conveys a strong message of not judging and dismissing customs that seem entirely ludicrous before trying to understand them. Yes, I am aware that \\"Shogun\\" is historically inaccurate. However, this book wasn't meant to serve as an introduction to feudal Japan, but rather as book to be read for enjoyment purposes only. \\"Shogun\\" is, without a doubt, one the greatest historical novels ever written.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I choose this rating because the book was really good and I enjoyed it.  My likes are the concept of the costume Katniss is supposed to wear and how she killed snow.  My dislikes are how Prim died because I didn't want her to die and how fast-paced the book was.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who loves dystopian novels.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|Ms Morton is certainly an accomplished story teller and this is yet another to add to her growing list.  Her cast of characters and plot are always well thought out and believable, drawing you into the intrigue.

B009KS4XRO|1.0|I love playing bingo however when they had a special for $19.99 for 28000 coins, I purchased it with an amazon gift card however my bingo account was never credited. This was since the early part of this month. This isn't the first time I made a purchase and didn't receive what I paid for. They keep responding to my emails by saying I have to do an upgrade. Did that but did not get anything. I feel angry that they stole $20 from me and won't refund me.
B00D8WJ9JK|5.0|To keep it short, the album it's full of substance. A bit of the classic hip hop, lyrical content is exquisite. Great album, which is why even though it didn't debut at number one it rose to number one!

B005MHI0QM|5.0|It is something I have always wanted to read.  To see the change in her as she is in hiding, goes through her early teens, becoming a young woman.  She had the makings of an excellent writer, but more important, such wisdom and beauty.  You could feel her difficulties in being cooped up with others, never going outside etc.  When her diary ended, I wished it could have continued, meaning that she would have continued to live.
B001AQR3JY|2.0|This movie didn't play right on my DVD player. All the images were delayed by 1/2 a second. Not sure why. So we had to watch it on our laptop. It worked on the laptop, but not the viewing experience I had hoped for on our 50 inch tv screen. Wish it would have worked on our DVD player.

0156029065|4.0|Umberto Eco is a professor of semiotics, as well as a highly successful author of historical mysteries and fabulous tales. This book is a bit of both, which will delight many readers, but possibly bore some, as well. Despite its loose structure, I greatly enjoyed its playfulness, which manages to be provocative as well as entertaining. But I can understand why some readers expecting a tighter and more defined narrative could be put off. There are already a number of good, descriptive reviews shown, so I will try only to add a particular perspective on Eco's style, which might help some prospective readers decide if this is their cup of tea.<br /><br />To borrow from Wikipedia:  \\"Semiotics, also called semiotic studies and including (in the Saussurean tradition) semiology, is the study of signs and sign processes (semiosis), indication, designation, likeness, analogy, metaphor, symbolism, signification, and communication.\\" In short, Eco is fascinated by language and signs, including lies, myths and all the devices we use to convey meaning through stories. The hero of this novel, Baudolino, is a teller of extraordinary tales, which may or may not be true, and which touch on many elements of philosophy and religion, set generally in the context of history around the time of Constantinople's sacking (ironically) by a Crusader army. His stories cleverly layer meaning, shedding light on our human foibles with sympathy and ironic humor, while sometimes engaging in outrageous word play. It helps if you know something of the history of the period, as well as a bit about obscure religious/philosophical debates, or if you have ever been amused by the exotic tales of travelers of all ages. Above all, you will probably favor the book if you share some of Eco's simple love or words and language in all its forms.<br /><br />I would also like to add that the translator from the Italian, William Weaver, must himself be an extraordinary linguist and story teller: Translating a novelby a seriously playful semiotics professor is no small task; translating this word-splendid and conceptually clever work so as to maintain all these elements --- well, that is remarkable.

B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Game is lots of fun and challenging. The entire family enjoys playing, young and old. I would reccomend it for anyone.
B006LSZECO|4.0|If you want a mystery that is 100% solved, no loose ends then this is not the book for you. But that's part of what makes it great - you can create in your mind how you want the story to end. It's hard to put this book down once you meet all the characters. They are complex and intriguing making this an easy book to get lost in for hours. One friend read it in 2 days while on vacation. Looking forward to reading some of Flynn's other works.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Enjoyed all the Three books in the  series couldn't put the books down. If you like this sort of read definitely a must.
B00A83075M|5.0|This film surprised me tenfold when I first saw it in theaters. I went in expecting another boring Pixar wannabe, something with dumb jokes aimed towards immature kids alone and not really any storyline or character to identify with. But this one really knocked me off my feet! Wreck-It Ralph is a film set apart from other animations that I've seen in recent years. It is a fresh perspective that does not disappoint, with a lovable set of characters from all walks of life. The dialogue in this movie is not the typical fodder you find in children's movies these days. It is intelligent, witty, and keeps me engaged. This is one of those movies made \\"for kids,\\" but we all know very well that adults were a huge portion of the target audience. There is something here for everyone. Two thumbs up!
B000VSAEYI|5.0|I bought this for my 15 month old DD and she absolutely loves it!  We have play dates all the time, and kids of all ages seem to enjoy it.  It is huge, and the slide is pretty stable, despite other reviews.  Would definitely recommend it!

B004G600A4|5.0|This movie is great, I enjoyed it quite a lot when I first saw it in theaters. The music was entertaining, the animation style is whimsical, and the love story panders to the silly girl that I am. Rapunzel is adorable, the villains are threatening without being terrifying. It is perfect for children and adults alike!
B005DJREGQ|5.0|My life on found footage film is what I call this. It was hilarious even though I don't condone one nighters.
B000TO0TB2|1.0|I recall stumbling across a used copy of City of Glass when I was a kid and liking it for some inexplicable reason. I never bothered reading the two following installments in the trilogy, so when I saw them all bundled together in a single Kindle volume, I jumped for joy. That was an Amazon gift card well-spent. The New York Trilogy is hideous, pretentious and almost unreadable. Since this is a trilogy, I'll review each book on its own.<br /><br />City of Glass<br /><br />The lengthiest book in the series, it's also the only one worth reading. The plot concerns Daniel Quinn, a hermit mystery novel author who gets embroiled in an actual detective case after being mistaken for Paul Auster. Oh yes, Auster is a character in his own novel. I smell postmodern hijinks!<br /><br />City of Glass is afflicted with all the problems of modern literature; lots of exposition, adjective abuse, and page-long paragraphs. Still, unlike the following two books, it's interesting because it at least tries to conform to the structure of a narrative, with a discernible plot, dialogue and a character arc, detailing Quinn involving himself in the case to the point where he descends into gibbering insanity. At the very least, I was motivated to keep reading. You can spout all kinds of babble about how City of Glass is about breaking down the boundaries between truth and fiction and questioning the relationship between author and reader, but none of it matters. If you want a good, vaguely Coen-esque mystery story, City of Glass is a decent read.<br /><br />Ghosts<br /><br />The plot of Ghosts is nearly identical to City of Glass: a private detective is assigned to tail some guy and eventually spirals into madness in the process. The main difference is that with Ghosts, Auster decided to dispense with such irrelevant distractions as \\"action\\" and \\"dialogue,\\" instead burying us in a nonstop monologue of the protagonist's thoughts, which naturally wander all over the place and have nothing to dowith the story. Even better, all of the characters are named after colors (e.g. Blue, Black, White, Gold), which combined with Auster's squid-ink prose means you'll need a flow chart to keep track of everything.<br /><br />The few short segments of Ghosts that aren't Blue's inane exposition are like oases in a desert, but even then Auster can't resist the urge to muck things up. Take this segment where Blue is confronted by his fiance (just about the only character who isn't given a color for a name, but incessantly referred to as \\"the future Mrs. Blue\\"), who has understandably gotten sick of his undercover games and found another man:<br /><br />\\"You! she says to him. You!\\"<br /><br />The line has no quotation marks in the book; I added the ones here to separate Auster's writing from my own. Who does he think he is, Cormac McCarthy? And of course, that's the only dialogue in that section; \\"the ex-future Mrs. Blue's\\" physical assault on Blue is written in even more exposition! Skip this.<br /><br />The Locked Room<br /><br />I made it all of two chapters into this before giving up. The Locked Room is written in the exact same dialogue-free expository style as Ghosts, and I was so burnt out from trying to make it through that one that I couldn't take it anymore. The plot is at least different; it concerns an unnamed narrator's search for his childhood friend Fanshawe. Perhaps I'm just being unfair. Perhaps The Locked Room is actually a really good read and I was just so put off by Ghosts that all of Paul Auster's writing is forever ruined for me. But I seriously doubt it.<br /><br />The New York Trilogy is a encapsulation of everything I hate about modern literature. It's turgid, condescending, obtuse, and pointless. But the sad thing is that Luc Sante got it right in the book's intro: Paul Auster is the poet laureate of New York City, though not for the reasons he thinks. The New York Trilogy is the perfect book for the New York of Rudy Giuliani and Michael Bloomberg, a stultifying police state run by over-educated white people who think All Things Considered is really deep and get the vapors whenever anyone says anything vaguely controversial. It's perfect for the New York of the hipsters, pencil-necked dweebs from Seattle or Milwaukee thinking they're going to be the next Thurston Moore or Lydia Lunch while they snack on artisan bread courtesy of their trust funds. It's perfect for a New York defanged, declawed and stripped of everything that made it interesting and unique, made safe for underemployed Midwestern brats and bored Australian tourists. The New York everyone romanticizes--the New York of danger, intrigue and passion--is dead and buried.<br /><br />And this neutered New York has produced a literati that spends all day sniffing its own farts. Jonathan Safran Foer, Colson Whitehead, Nicole Krauss, Gary Shteyngart, Jhumpa Lahiri, David Foster Wallace (actually wait, he's dead; I've never derived so much joy from a suicide in my life), and all the rest: worthless hacks devoid of curiosity, humanity or talent.<br /><br />The only reason I can see to buy the New York Trilogy is if you're an adjunct English professor looking for new ways to torture your students. Alternately, give it to them as an example of how not to write. If there's a version of City of Glass available on its own on Kindle, I recommend you buy that instead.
B00C4YZ12C|5.0|There are some games that never get old even after three decades, and you'll find them here in a single package. Old and young alike will like this throwback to the 80s with twists and charms all its own.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Both kids like playing as well as watching the other one play with all the character interaction.  Challenging for the 7 yr old some times, but he still loves it.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|Having also experienced &#34; the other side&#34; I found Eban experiences quite relative to my own.  Many of his descriptions of the first portion were like &#34;astral projecting&#34; but after &#34;crossing over&#34; and trying to describe the absolute love that is there - words will never adequately describe that experience!  Before my own experience believed there was a God - but now I know God exists.  Eban's tremondous medical and science background can only confirm his esperiences.  A very well written book with Great insight to to experience.
B000W1586S|5.0|I really like this album. I can listen to it start to finish. Just a laid back vibe to the album.
B00AR1G3FS|5.0|We had the DVD for several years but wanted the Blue Ray. It is great on DVD but much better on Blue Ray.
B006JD48NM|5.0|This was everything I hoped it would be and more.  I've watched it atleast a half a dozen times and intend to watch it again.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Wish it did not end. Loved it so much. Felt like you were with them and feeling what they were feeling for each other. Could not put book down. Hope we do not have to wait to long for the next book. Sylvia day is a wonderful writer.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|It's really cool on kindle<br /><br />It has a very good story line that's pretty awesome I mean I liked it
B0070Z4M4I|4.0|Awesome movie that tells the story of the events that led up to the original film. It stays true to the mood and atmosphere of the first film, with visual amazing visual effects and a fairly well done attempt to replicate the 1981 setting of the first film. If you've never seen the first film I'd recommend seeing this one first and then the original. While the original is still a better film compared to the prequel both are worth the watch if you like sci-fi/horror and body horror films.
B005KCGIUY|5.0|Of course, it goes without saying,  any thing, Maynard, puts his voice to will be worth adding to your collection.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was a book that was difficult to put down.The reader had to suspend reality on occasion, but that made it all the more fun. I'll spend a lot of time thinking about &#34;the butterfly effect&#34;.
B00CH87HF4|4.0|Very cool I really enjoy playing<br />Nice graphics good and challenging quests<br />It would nice  to earn jewels instead of having to buy them
B004SIIBGU|5.0|I sell and buy on Ebay and using it on a tablet or iphone is great I use it often more than my desktop to keep up to date.
B0053YGYO4|5.0|Nothing new.  It's coldplay and if you like coldplay you'll like this just as much as everything else.  Good stuff.
B006MPKDD6|5.0|Another Harry Bosch thriller, will keep you awake at night keep up the great work Michael Connelly you are a legend
B008OOYALE|5.0|I just love dragon story. It has never crashed on my devise and it never gets old. The only thing that stinks is that it needs Internet. Otherwise dragon story is the best game that I have. If you don't you need to get it!!!
B007RJUHB4|5.0|I like Florence and the Machine.  I have several CDs.  Yet, her voice is enough, no need for electric.  Great
B00DRPVE3M|4.0|Fun to play. A little difficult to read the cards when you have a lot in your hand. Otherwise a fun game. Plus you can rematch players in your group
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I really liked the older version, until they upgraded it. Then after that, it would never open. I really thought there was nothing wrong with the older version. It was fine the way it was.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|THE BEST SERIES I'VE EVER READ! IF YOU LIKED THE HUNGER GAMES THIS WILL BLOW YOU AWAY. HAS THE PERFECT MIXTURE OF ACTION, ADVENTURE AND ROMANCE!
B007JCP8FE|4.0|Finally Shinedown returns with a new venture and it kicks. It has all the elements one would expect from a power group like Shinedown. Vocalist Brent Smith is spot on with the chilling vocals and the band is as tight as ever. Shinedown has HOWEVER cross the road into the guarded language for younger (and some older ) listeners. Swear words are nothing new but it lessens my enthusiasm for this release. Not every song has the words but the ones that do, I just feel its not needed. The music stands on its own without the added edginess.<br /><br />Thanks Shinedown for returning. A great effort true fans will appreciate.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|Addicting game! Love the graphics but not the pay2win aspect. This game is much like other tower defense games out there (e.g. Stockman...) but with better graphics. Still worth downloading since it's free...
B00APKIN1I|5.0|Nothing like a good music project to bring together the musical greats of a couple different generations. This album is to be appreciated as much as enjoyed. I have suggested it to everyone.
B000JMKQX0|4.0|I really got hooked by the intro and the story line sounded very intriguing. However, some of the \\"interviews\\" were very choppy and didn't flow or make sense. The ending was rather vague.  But overall it was a good book, and worth buying.
B00BFUUMO8|3.0|It won't let me down load it on my android but I play on my phone and its very very very good but don't get this on android
B00CWV8TIU|2.0|The movie started out interesting then it just .got stupid towards the end. I think the movie would be better if it was realistic.  I was more impressed with the trailer.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|Oh my God.  Sylvia day has done it again.  I just started reading her books in February when I received a notice in my email about her book bared to you and I just can't stop reading her books.  She is awesome as a writer.
B0070YDOT8|2.0|I was expecting more from this app not at all happy with the results. Slots are easy but the other games  we're  not for my  fancy. There's an international flare  to this casino so forming your team is difficult also. Sorry people but I decided to delete  the app.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I've read other &#34;zombie&#34; books, but this writer approaches it differently by using an interview method.  It gives a completely comprehensive overview of what a post apocalyptic zombie world would be like.  It's a great read!
B00COGZ8FU|1.0|Poorly done with few redeeming qualities.  I think they gave up on this one. Watch Justified on FX instead.  Much better.
B008ER9QLK|5.0|Finally, Wagners' epic vision can be realized, maybe for the first time, on an imaginary scale equal to the music.  Now, I know that RW himself wanted his opera produced a certain, specific (read as very, very Traditional) way.  Cosima enforced this during her reign as director for the rest of her very long life.  If you like that presentation, you got that other Met production thats as good as the traditional style will get.  IMO opera wont survive w/o something new and fresh, it really needs to be re-interpreted with each new generation.  This version is pretty spectacular.  Others have used projection technology, but this has \\"The Machine.\\"  This has the added advantage of a 3-dimensional space that the projection can be shot on.  So, in Seigfried, you have a beautiful forest scene that the actors can walk across, while the computer technology rustles the leaves underfoot.  Then the Machine can change postion to a wholly vertical screen if necessary.  Then, take a look at the amazing journey to Nibelheim, the Machine is twisted as Wotan and Loge \\"walk\\" on suspened wires across to the depths of the netherworld.  The climax to Das Rheingold is... wow.  As the Gods ascend up the Rainbow Bridge (here a beautiful glimmering computer generated and projected rainbow), the Machine then tilts down on both sides until it is completely vertical, and a full Starfield is seen.  Wow.  This reminded me of that scene in Immortal Beloved.  Oh, the opening with the undulating wave effect and the Rhinemaidens suspended in midair, bubbles coming out of their mouths while they sing.  The technology is finally here, and vision has equalled vision.  So many great moments (and many \\"dull 1/4 hours\\").  One final note, a slightly negative one, and this is regarding the actual libretto.  Dare I criticize Wagner himself?  Why not... the Ring is way, way, much too repetitive in it's storytelling.  You hear the same freaking subplots told about 20 times over and over and over by seemingly every possible character.  It got on my nerves about the 15th time I heard how Wotan could not steal the ring himself so he had to have Seigfried do it for him.  I mean, I've heard this already.  Once, maybe twice... but 20?  I dont need that.  And this true of every single subplot.  7 times you hear how Seigfried had no fear and killed the dragon and through the blood can understand birds.  I dont need to hear this told 7 times.  Ok, Ive beaten this point enough... Lol.  Awesome music, awesome production, all on Blu Ray delivered to your door .....we live in great times my friends.
B008OOYALE|5.0|this game is great my grandson and I play it everyday all I hear is is grandpa lets play dragons lol

B009ERK1T0|5.0|This band just gets better and better,wow! Where would we be without Deftones? The mood they set and the style music they bring to the table are just uncomparable. They are in a league of there own! There is no way to catagorize there music, its Deftones ladies and gentlemen, its Deftones!
B0046B8GEQ|4.0|The voices were great.  I loved the little Minions.  The animation was great.  Good for children or adults.  Funny lines.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its is cute and fun game. id recommend it for when you are bored or have kids. its a good free game.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|Great read; story telling at its finest.  Martin sits atop all others writing in this genre. Can't wait to start book number 3.
B00DHHFKE4|5.0|I have not read the book yet, but I got addicted to the TV series on Netflix. AMAZING! It is not for kids at all - but I am hooked! I only have 4 episodes left to watch, and then I have to wait until 2014 for next season. I couldn't wait to just watch one season each week, it completely draws you right in. I don't watch TV often or have many shows I care to watch, but this one I LOVE!
B0011NVCSO|5.0|We got this when I was pregnant with our son, to add to &#34;his&#34; music collection -- it's a great album for relaxing or rocking a baby :)
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|It's good and I love it I think a lot of other people will like it to its really good!!!!!!!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The author deftfully reels you in with peripheral stories that shine a light on a wonderful universe. The stories are great, but the bits and pieces you get of the Silo and the world it exists in are magnificent and paced with a surgeon's precision. It is rare to find this sort of entertainment stream, rewarding the reader's curiosity. Hugh Howey done good.
B00008CMR6|4.0|This was a good movie made by John Wayne and I enjoyed revisiting it. I always enjoy John Waynes movies.
B001ECQ4DA|5.0|If you watch the show, then you know it's great. If not -- try a few episodes and you'll be hooked. Laugh out loud funny. Blu-ray has a few fun extras.
B000FCKC4C|5.0|This was a pleasure to read.  It was a good story with interesting characters and situations.  There were some life lessons added in.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Its awesome I love it its crazy fun and stuff .I like it its cool kinda wireless crazy but ya baby
B00000D9TQ|5.0|GREATEST ALBUM YET FROM PHIL. GREAT PRICE TOO. IF YOUR A PHIL COLLINS FAN THIS IS THE ALBUM FOR YOU.
B000ATQYT2|5.0|This is a really fun version of A Christmas Carol -- any fan of the muppets or of Christmas movies should own it!
B0094M2Z9O|5.0|A definition of a &#34;classic&#34; is a movie that you can watch multiple times through your life and get different things out of it each time.<br /><br />I remembered this as being a great &#34;war story&#34; with fantastic performances by Alec Guinness and William Holden. Re-watched this recently and was surprised how much a &#34;study of human motivation&#34; and &#34;management lessons&#34; are weaved through the story.<br /><br />&#34;pre teens&#34; might be bored by the character development - call this one a &#34;mature&#34; war story. The hd picture and sound (streaming through an Xbox 360) were very good.
B00DGNO3WE|4.0|This was a fun movie, but I figured out early on that we would never actually get to hear them really sing. Billy Connolly's character was a hoot and it is great to see celebrities embracing their golden years.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|WAL- MART WAS TEN DOLLARS MORE FOR THIS MOVIE. THE BLU-RAY IS INCREDIBLE ON MY NEW 80 TEVELISION. IT JUST GETS BETTER.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun to figure out the clues and solve escape routes.  makes you use your noggin'. lol.  Two thumbs up!
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|What a great read. I stumbled on this book looking for something for teenage sponsor t he summer. It looked better than the average YA, and started it on a whim. Two day s later, I'm ready for book 2 and the continuing adventures of Jace and Clary. Although to this at- heart romantic I'm hoping J and C aren't brother and sister!
B00DC7N9NS|3.0|I didn't enjoy this movie as much as I had hoped. The effects were good, but I felt that the characters were weak.
B000002UUH|5.0|WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND ABOUT ALL OF THE MUSIC HE DID NOT PRODUCE. HE WAS THE BEST, JUST LIKE THIS ALBUM.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|The reviewers before me have already done a great job examining the songs and basically reminding all of us why this album is a definite must-have for both fans and even non-fans of one of the world's greatest musical bands or duos of all time.<br /><br />I highly recommend that you watch the Telegraph's 25 minute video interview of Neil, Chris and Stuart Price talking about the making of this album. In it, Neil says that it reminds him of \\"Introspective (1988), and \\"Relentless\\" (1993), both albums that contained full-length club and dance tracks meant for pure pleasure. Neil continues to say that \\"Electric\\" was in part a response to some critic who posted on iTunes a negative review to \\"Elysium\\" suggesting that it needed \\"MORE BANGING MORE LASERS.\\" Listen to \\"Axis\\" and you will now better see how the duo has responded to that criticism!<br /><br />According to Neil, The Album cover with the waves logo was done to illustrate \\"the shock of electricity and movement\\" as well as the colour blue to represent \\"Electric Blue.\\"<br /><br />This cd will rank as one of their best in an already exhaustive 25 years catalogue of music.
B00CCEHR80|4.0|As a product this release is 5 stars - nice package, nice booklet, nicely printed CDs. The setlist is 5 stars. The music itself is 4 ish stars. If you're looking at this to begin with there's a 99% chance you're already a fan of the Dead, JGB (or possibly Bela Fleck). Which means you probably know all about the 1990 run of JGB shows, who was in the band, and why you should care. As is generally true of the era Jerry's playing is extremely fluid and his singing fairly weak though that lends itself to some of these selections. Given the type of songs here and their intentional treatment...the overall vibe is laid back, a little maybe lotta reggae, chilling and maxing. You get Dead tunes, Band tunes, Holland-Dozier via JT tunes, Dylan, Peter Tosh, Jimmy Cliff, Van Morrison, and more. The core band is JGB 85-95: Jerry, Seals, Kahn, Kemper, with Jaclyn and Gloria on vocals and Bela Fleck for the second set. This is supremely mellow but the weariness in Jerry's voice that comes through at certain points, particularly relative to his often strong voice a few months earlier on the Dead Spring Tour is distracting and sometimes a bit depressing, but that's what you get with a snapshot of an epic musician in this context. Still very highly recommended for those who know what they're getting. Get him to the Greek...!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This was a great puzzle game kept me enthralled and busy for almost 2 hours. Then I was out of levels.
0385537689|5.0|Amazing series so far. It's what every man wants and what most women want but won't tell you they want.
B00APJLY0Q|5.0|It's absolutely adorable and perfect for kids! I highly recommend it to anyone with children. (3 & up) sure to be a spooky classic.
B003ELOQCK|4.0|I've had a love/hate relationship with Dublin's finest since someone's older brother shoved a copy of October (vinyl) in my face in the summer of 1981 or so. Musically they have always been great, with a few missteps. Of the early stuff, I wore out a vinyl record, several tapes and a VHS tape of Red Rocks...during the Joshua Tree (becoming bigger than the Beatles) era I got frustrated a bit but I loved Achtung...I come and go but at this point I think all their records offer a lot. My wife and I drove around Hawaii in 2001 with about three CDs one of which was All That You Can't Leave Behind, now one of my favorite albums.Touring wise, I missed the early days but had numerous chances to see them in &#34;mega mongo dome&#34; mode and balked. That's not really my scene. I tried to make it work when they did their straight rock band shows at MSG a few years ago but had a work conflict. But the 360 setup caught my attention, and the clips I saw looked very promising. When then U2360 Tour came to NJ went a with a buddy who had also been yearning to see U2 forever and we were literally stunned at the quality of the show both as musical experience and performance art/technical exposition. If I hadn't been to the show I am not sure I would care about this product at all, but as a souvenir of the tour for those who went, it's a winner even if you're not likely to watch it over and over. Bigger is not always better but in the case of U2360 it certainly was. Bono and the boys know what they are doing.
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Finally a FB app for the Kindle Fire that does not take you to the mobile site. I am happy.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|Thos was by far one of the best books that I have read in a while!!!-!!!:) if you read ot you will get hooked!!:)
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I bought this second season because it is not available at Neflix....and I got addicted.  I will be buying the next season as soon as it gets available!
B005DZMP00|4.0|I'm a fan of Europe '72 but not psychotic about it (as many Deadheads are). When Vol 2 came out I was excited as there were obviously many performances left off of Europe '72 the original. The quality of the performances and recordings here are both exceptional, but I am not sure this works as a stand alone product; you really need to have and know the original triple album to see where and how these &#34;extras&#34; fit in. I think Dave did a tremendous job in crafting a companion package, but personally I have found I like some of the full show releases from Europe '72 more than either the original album or this very nice addendum to it. I didn't spring for the full box (though I may at some point, it's in reprints) but rather decided which 4-5 shows I liked and bought those after this. From a value perspective this kills, it's just more of a sampler. Of course new Ice Cream Kid art is fun too.
B00821OX98|5.0|I am a big fan of The Walking Dead and this series is just as good without as much gore. I would recommend it to family and friends.
B000FBJF6Y|5.0|I checked out this book for a simple read between flights during my layovers, and I just fell in love with it.great story, great main character, wish there was more!
B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|great gameeeeeeeeeeeeeeee i love playing defence. most especially hero defence im bored of some rpg games so for now defence games
B000H5U65C|5.0|These guys bring a whole new level of intensity to sludge-prog and you don't need to be a one-eyed sasquatch who can see the future to figure that out. Just when you thought Leviathan was about as a good a skull-cracking concept album starring Brent Hinds could be...Blood Mountain inches it out for best overall Mastodonian slab of slathering sleekness. Remove your reptilian brain and carry on...hard rock is rarely harder, or smarter. Crack the Skye is more melodic and frequently slower, and The Hunter has more hummable riffs but as far as I'm concerned this and Leviathan are the Mastodon peak to date. If you like metal, Melvins, Thin Lizzy, or chunky rhythms just get it and turn it to 11.

B0030IIZ3S|4.0|I love this move, I thought the case would be in a blu-ray case (I'm kind of partial to the blue cases) but it wasn't regardless the blu-ray movie and digital copy work perfectly.
B00BTHWFEC|5.0|See my CD review for the full review of this outstanding surprise of an album. The CD/digital mix is a little overly compressed as many have said...and yes the vinyl fixes that as many have also said.

B00DC7N9NS|3.0|Okay, it had enough twist in it to keep it interesting. Kind of glad that I waited for the small screen for this one, but would not have minded seing the matinee showing for $5 to see it.
B000FCKGPC|5.0|AFFC is the fourth book in the ASOIAF series, and while it may not contain everyone's favorite characters (Tyrion, etc) it has a lot of ground to cover and it works to keep everything moving.

B0036R92V2|5.0|Anyone who loves a good old spaghetti western will love this film. This ranks up with Eastwoods classics in my opinion.
B00D6BN9NK|5.0|Really know disappointment in this one either!!! Amazing to think Bruce has been able to keep this series alive, and do it well, all these decades!! Definitely recommend!!
B00CDT41RY|5.0|It's nice to see the white folk stereotyped rather than the black.  Yes, Django is an unusual black but there must have been many more if given the opportunity.  Besides, this flick is an engaging thriller with lots of gunplay and explosions.  I watched it twice.
B002361MLA|3.0|I would agree with other reviewers here in writing that Eckhart Tolle tends to repeat himself. The first half of the book is extremely useful in describing and explaining our true inner self, our Being and how to raise your consciousness by relying less on thinking and more on identifying with your unmanifested self. The tools include body scanning and awareness, mindfulness, observing thoughts and emotions and just \\"Being\\" in the style of Zen. A good portion of the book is dedicated to repeating the main theme: stay in the now, the mind is evil and is responsible for the deaths of 100 million people in the last century, time and space and self is an illusion, among other ideas. As someone who considers myself as a person in spiritual recovery the book offers many answers and provides tools I can use in addition to those I have taken from Buddhism, Christianity and the 12 Step literature. I take what works for me and leave the rest. I disagree that the mind is all bad, despite being the root of  many of my self made problems due to a pattern of destructive thinking, which by the way this book is excellent at providing an easy approach to silencing the self defeating mind. I still believe that the mind has its uses and has served me well at times. The mind may have created weapons of war and bred racism, nationalism, religious conflict and wars of all scale but it has also created the tools of peace and healing. I think Tolle should give the mind more credit than he does and assert that it has a \\"dark side\\" and a \\"light side\\", we are free to choose which to use and should be mindful of the tendency of the mind to create an ego that can get us into trouble. I was also confused to read about portals to the source. Death I thought would be the final portal open to all but those that resist it, that part of the natural order is to return to the source. The concept that at the point of death a portal to the other realm opens but very briefly and most people miss it seemsludicrous and puts far too much of a human slant on the mystery of death and transition. Tolle's interpretations of the teachings of Jesus are also interesting and worthy of further investigation. Other than that \\"The Power of Now\\" does not offer anything new that I have not already read in the last year in the dozen or so books on mindfulness, Zen, Christianity and spiritual recovery. I still enjoyed it and got a lot out of it but I don't view it as the burning lamp I was told it was and expected to find after reading some of the reviews here.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Though at first I thought it would somehow be similar to temple run, I guess its even better this way. The best part of it is playing in another view where the camera view changes. I just hoped Agnes can be played as a character too.
B002PMPTIO|5.0|As I have watched the entire Star Trek franchise throughout the years beginning with the original Star Trek series as a teenager, I was very curious how they were going to re-work the original story line to fit into today's living! WOW, never a doubt, story line was there as well as enough funny remarks for those of us who remember the 1st series/movies, so see the old characters come to life once again, spoke volumes as to the actors who obviously did they're homework of the original series. Saw it originally at the big screen and have since watched it 3 times since release. Each time I catch something I missed the previous times. Always a joy to watch. Gotta figure out now how to see the 2nd one at the big screen before I see it on the smaller screen as I missed it the 1st time around. Hoping I can find a big screen theater that's going to re-play it before they release on DVD.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|its super fun and has great but at one point it wouldn't open up and let me play but other than :that its super fun
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|couldn't put it down! Loved that at times is almost scared me, but couldn't stop reading. I will recommend to all my friends.
B006FO3ERQ|2.0|Dragged myself through this one thinking it would pick up but all the while disliking his over-stressing of certain themes and philosophies and certainly not liking his style decision to give away every piece of the action chapters ahead of its occurrence. Like another reviewer I also felt he was repeating things just for the sake of making some kind of work quota.<br />I feel like I should look at Independence Day just so I can get a clue about the writing awards...
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|Finally a way to send myself pictures or documents without searching through 100 emails!!! I'm able to share between my laptop, iPhone, and kindle without any hassle. I don't really like \\"clouds\\" to store information, but I do love this.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|As usual, Tom Clancy doesn't disappoint.  However, at the pace I have been reading his books, I run out before he can write another one.  Worth waiting for, though.
B004I744AS|5.0|What can I say about a dictionary... it is a dictionary for the Kindle, and it works like a dictionary is expected to. Dictionary.
B00386EZJU|5.0|This is in my opinion (and the opinion of many others) the finest film music from all of 2011.  John Powell seems to have found two niches for himself: highly stylized heist/spy music, and fantastic animation music.  I've been aware of Powell for a very long time (since his zany and super-fun collaboration with Harry Gregson-Williams for Chicken Run), but really started paying attention to his compositions with the film, Happy Feet.  He has many incredible animation scores to his credit, but I'd argue that this is by the far the best.<br /><br />The main themes are ethnically charged with a cross between Scottish and Nordic influences, both in the melodies and instrumentation.  There's a lot of raucous action music in this score, but where it really shines is in its more intimate moments.  My favorite tracks are The Dragon Book, which begins with a deep men's chorus and imbues the scene with dark mystery and awakening awareness, and Forbidden Friendship.  The themes develop slowly with vibraphone to begin with, but build into a lovely moment of suspended tension in female chorus that is relieved beautifully in a single voice.  It's really something else.  Transcendent, even.  The track, Romantic Flight, features a gorgeous and floating violin solo as well.<br /><br />The CD has many highlights, but those are the best.  Preview them if you can; you'll be sold that this is some of the best music written for film in the last few years.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Courageous is not only entertaining but educational as well. The script covers many of the nations issues and does it in an outstanding manner. The inspiration the film provides motivates parents to adopt similiar solutions to their family situations. I urge all parents to view the film with their appropriate age (teenage and older} children, enjoy the script and adopt the excellant solution offered to solve family issues. Paul Homlish
B009XIXVU6|4.0|What an uplifting book about how family ,love, and kindness matters. I really enjoyed how all the story lines met up and not how you could have predicted
0440237688|5.0|The Giver is a well-written novel that should be read by more than just children.  It causes one to contemplate the role of government, community and society.  The book builds itself well, exposing one detail at a time of the controlled society in which Jonas lives.  It is easy-to-read, well-paced and has a classic ending.
B000LXQVA4|4.0|My baby is 4 months old and can almost touch the floor. She likes all the colors to look at. Easy to put together. Only down side is that only one station has lights and sounds.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It was confusing and quite strange. Some parts were okay, but overall...weird. I would not recommend this read to anyone.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|I am not all that in to this game like I have been with others. It is fairly easy to use but it didn't really make me want to continue to play. I go to bingo with my mother in law regularly but just didn't like this game.
B004GYY714|5.0|I wanted to get my brothers radio station out in PA and my grandson fixed me up with the tunein radio. I am so glad that I can get it now.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Gets frustrating at times but after figuring it out, it's like it wasn't as hard as I had originally thought.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|Loved almost everything. Have never laughed so much for a book ever!!! Wish I had a friend like Poppy Wyatt..
B008JFUR10|5.0|I loved it! Guillermo makes beautiful eye-candy. This movie is fun, fairly paced, and invigorating. The battles build on top of each like a battle to 1-up each other. Great surprises as the movie moves along and beautiful design in the wardrobe, locations, digital interfaces, armor, robots, and the monsters (Kaiju). Not a new story conceptually, but good enough to motivate all characters to want to move forward. If Guillermo didn't do this, Godzilla in his hands would have been fantastic.
B00CL8D83U|5.0|When West End Girls was first released, I purchased Pet Shop Boys first album, Please. I became a huge fan from the get go and have purchased every album they've released since, including Alternative and Format, their 2 double disc collections of B-sides and bonus tracks. After hearing Axis and Vocal, I was eagerly awaiting the release of Electric. Although I didn't roundly dismiss their last CD, Elysium, I would agree it is their 2nd weakest album after 2000's Release. Now, to Electric, WOW!! This is the ultimate summer CD. What this does more than anything is encapsulate why Pet Shop Boys are the greatest pop duo in the world. And it will also remind everyone that they have been around for the last 30 years, basically being awesome. It should bring the younger generation into the PSB fold and hopefully make them revisit the full Pet Shop Boys discography. I would definitely put this right up there with Very, Bilingual, Yes, Nightlife and Behavior. The production by Stuart Price is outstanding and makes it an all out dance floor blitz reminiscent of 1988's Introspective. Lyrically, it is not as strong as the group of CDs I listed, but there are some real gems including \\"Love is a Bourgeois Construct\\" and \\"Flourescent\\" which gives us all we love in Neil Tenant's songwriting, so I would say those 2 and the opening instrumental Axis would be my 3 favorite tracks. With all the great albums coming out this summer, you must add this one to your collection.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|Enjoyed the human qualities of the characters - look forward to seeing the movie now - good reading for all
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|The game was great, although I was a bit disappointed in how short it was. I am looking forward to the next chapter.
B00013M6NK|5.0|Quick service, good price. They were slightly different size, a tiny bit larger  but they work just fine. Good job.
B003ASLJRW|5.0|Very good movie that will keep you guessing for the movie on just what type of person clint eastwood will turn out to be.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really fun game. Couldn't put it down once I started playing it. Wish there were more levels and less updates. But overall great choice.
B0055PGUYU|4.0|Duhigg expertly unravels the mystery behind habits and teaches valuable tricks for altering them in personal and professional life. At times the examples ramble on, but overall I highly recommend this book for those looking to change an established habit or to better understand how they are formed and what they lead to in business and life.
B0002VFXFE|5.0|Read reviews on this item before purchasing and was skeptical if it was really worth it. I am extremely satisfied with this product and will continue to use it (or the next best thing) when I build another computer.
B007V5CF5K|4.0|This was my first hidden object game and it was entertaining and challenging. I definitely enjoy this type of game and plan to buy more.
B003ELY7PG|5.0|Loved this little book.<br />It feels great to read about people that is doing things their own way and are very successful doing so.<br /> There are so many good tips and things that open up for thinking in new ways in this one.
193700788X|5.0|I'm a fan of the True Blood series and had to read this book after seeing the poor ratings and comments on amazon. So I did and found that, like all her other books, I really enjoyed it. Yes, there were changes to her writing style, the big one being writing in the third person. That didn't bother me, it just added more to the story in my opinion. And yes, Sookie did not end up with who I expected. Many, many, many people were angry with Charlaine's choice but having read the last three books in a row it wasn't unexpected. I liked Sookie's choice because it made sense in the contexts of the book, it certainly wasn't random. For me, everything has come full circle and has been wrapped up neatly. Ultimately though, I support Charlaine's ending because, after all, it is her story to tell.
0316069434|5.0|Reading Michael Connelly's books is always a pleasure.  Waiting for the next episode in Harry's life and it won't be until 2014?
B008JGSM6G|3.0|Brain teased but pretty easy. Good to relax with. I enjoy it before bed as to empty my brain with.
B004J4WKUQ|4.0|Have I mentioned before how much I loathe bloated action scenes? I loathe bloated action scenes. What fun am I supposed to find in reading about characters attacking each other? Unfortunately, the last quarter of Ready Player One descends into a massive battle where the wholeheartedly good draws virtual weapons against the unabashedly evil, which led my eyes to skimskimskim since: I loathe bloated action scenes.<br /><br />Casting aside this disappointing ending, however, I found Ready Player One to be fantastically entertaining. It's not high literature, but on a popcorn level--where once you take a bite, you can't stop--it's excellent. It's about a young guy living in a dystopic future where everyone lives inside a virtual video game reality. This young guy faces off with a Big Bad Corporation that is trying to take control of the video game by winning a scavenger hunt contest created by the game's deceased creator. Winning the contest requires an encylopediac mind crammed with 80s pop culture trivia, early video games lore, and famed fantasy and science fiction knowledge.<br /><br />Now my familiarity with the 80s is limited. Beyond playing Duck Hunter and listening to Tainted Love on a loop, that decade does not exist for me, mostly because I did not exist. I would have loved a 90s version of this with challenges based on Beanie Babies, Tamagotchis, Pokemon cards, the Backstreet Boys, The Lion King, and Gameboy Colors, but alas...(though, whoa, I need to write that book pronto before I succumb to ND--Nineties Deprivation.) I was worried about not enjoying this due to my lack of 80s knowledge, but it's absolutely secondary. Some of the references triggered no neural impulse, yet I still understood what was going on.<br /><br />The main problem is that Ernest Cline is obviously a debut novelist. His prose is constructed almost entirely with simple sentences. A subject verbs something; then the subject verbs something else; next the subject verbs a new something else, &c. His characters are flat too. Wade, the protagonist, has no flaws and miraculously succeeds at everything he tries to do. The choice of Wade as the main character is disappointing actually. Another main character in the scavenger hunt, Art3mis, is a geek girl and would have been more interesting than your typical pimply white male hacker geek extraordinaire.<br /><br />There is also no depth. There is a chapter near the middle of the book where I could tell the author suddenly tried to add some deeper themes for pondering, but it failed since it was the opposite of effortless. Yet strangely, I didn't want to be challenged in my reading. I was enchanted enough by the creativity of the virtual reality world designed and by the scavenger hunt challenges themselves. The challenges are the best part. In a nice parallel fashion, the book is a virtual reality for us readers, a bit of personal escapism where we can put ourselves in the characters' places and try to solve the puzzles. So when Cline made a clumsy attempt at profundity, all I wanted was for him to return to the game so that I could get back in the zone.<br /><br />When you're looking for a few hours of fun, definitely read this. I can almost guarantee you'll enjoy it in the basest pleasure center of your brain. For now, excuse me, I need to hunt down my family's original Nintendo set and watch every John Hughes movie ever.
B000002KOJ|5.0|I've been listening to this album, along with Joni's debut record &#34;Song To A Seagull&#34;, for 40+ years after finding both albums in either one of my older sibling's respective record collections.  The serenity, mystery and longing within Joni's words & music on &#34;Clouds&#34; takes me to a meditative, reflective place; to a place where one dusts off the effects of life's damage, muses philosophically, and then gets back on the horse.  &#34;Clouds&#34; and &#34;Song To A Seagull&#34; complement each other nicely.  On both albums the instrumentation is spare, though not simple, and features, for the most part, just Joni's voice and her outstanding guitar work.  I also love the minor chords and unconventional chord changes within her melodies -- That are by turns, joyful and haunting; they border on the strange and yet they are accessible.<br /><br />As for Joni's lyrics on &#34;Clouds&#34; -- She is one of the few singer / songwriters whose lyrics will pop into my mind after not having heard one of her records for years: &#34;Varnished weeds in window jars ..... Tarnished beads on tapestries ..... Roses dipped in sealing wax ..... In a Bleecker Street cafe ..... I found someone to love today&#34; (Tin Angel); &#34;She's gotten to mysterious devotions ..... She's gotten to the zodiac and zen .....She's gotten into tarot cards and potions&#34; (Roses Blue); &#34;Your mail comes in from everywhere .....The writing looks like ladies' ..... But now their faces follow me ..... And all their eyes look shady&#34; (The Gallery); &#34;Through the windless wells of wonder ..... By the throbbing light machine ..... In a tea leaf trance or under&#34; (Songs To Aging Children Come); &#34;And so once again .....Oh, America my friend ..... And so once again ..... You are fighting us all&#34; (The Fiddle And The Drum).<br /><br />On &#34;Clouds&#34; as well as &#34;Song To A Seagull&#34; -- We encounter a woman in a tug of war between innocence and experience.  I listen to &#34;Clouds&#34; as if the album were one cut -- All of the tunes flow into each other so seamlessly that I often don't even notice the breaks in-between songs.  And Joni's painterly influence on her compositions is in full evidence here -- &#34;Tin Angel&#34; reminds me of the browns of Rembrandt.  &#34;Songs To Aging Children Come&#34; I will always remember as having been featured in the film &#34;Alice's Restaurant&#34;.  In &#34;Roses Blue&#34; Joni flirts, at least metaphorically, with her gypsy / pagan / spiritualist side.  And although &#34;Both Sides Now&#34; did indeed become a Lite FM staple -- I will always consider it to be The Folk Anthem of the Late 1960s Generation.<br /><br />Stephen C.

B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I like it because it has many different game shapes, clear tiles, not difficult, really fun to play. I'm going to delete some of my other Mahjong games, this one is much more enjoyable.

1476734941|1.0|This idea was articulated better when it was published in Eat Stop Eat. Nice job not being even close to original.
1781162646|5.0|Great summer read.  Classic Stephen King murder mystery. Loved the story and the everday characters and was so easy to read on the beach.
B00BESIKWM|1.0|So, the original Silent Hill film isn't the greatest movie ever made for a variety of reasons. It had a weak third act, unclear motivations for a number of the characters and the creatures they chose to use only made a limited amount of sense within the context of the movie. Nonetheless, it managed to get far more things right then it got wrong. Silent Hill: Revelation manages, by contrast, to do everything wrong and make even the carryovers from the first film rather awful.<br /><br />For the curious, Silent Hill is based on a game series by the same name and thus pulls a number of plot elements and characters from the series to the silver screen. Mind you, when it comes to Silent Hill: Revelation it manages to pull a lot of elements and make good use of none. It takes the major elements of the third game of the game series and attempts to awkwardly marry those elements to the events of the first movie with limited success. The connections it attempts to make the plot plausible stretch credulity even within a fantastic universe featuring a town which exists as a sort of hellish purgatory. Nothing about the plot makes the least bit of sense. The CG ranges from awful to god awful and the new creature design is only passable. Most of the scares are cheap and the horror is more of the gross-out variety rather than bothering to make any effort towards creating true atmosphere. Silent Hill: Revelation lacks even the basic creepy/spooky vibe that made most of the original Silent Hill film fun.<br /><br />Basically, Silent Hill: Revelation isn't worth your time or your money. Skip it and if you really need a Silent Hill fix either play the games (the first three in the series being good at their worst and phenomenal at their best) or watch the original movie.
B005C8ENI0|5.0|Loved it. It was fast paced and interesting and I loved all the twists and turns it took. And it has a good complete ending, a very essential thing in my book. Matthew McConaughey did a great job (and he's good lookin').
B0064MPXFA|4.0|Entertaining but lacks action if that's what your looking for. A good drama, acting is decent and is well written. Can get repetitive but still a good watch!
B00CLF80O0|3.0|I am a big Whitesnake fan.  I ordered the CD from Amazon before it went on sale.  I was hoping the sound of the CD would be better than Whitesnake's previous live CD \\"Made in Japan\\".  However, I am very disappointed!  The bass sound of the CD is so loud that it over-shadowed the vocals and the guitar sound.  The mixing and the production of the CD sound is so bad.  Similar to Whtesnake's \\"Made in Japan\\", I will most likely listen to it once or twice and put it aside.  Mr. Coverdale, please have someone else to produce your record next time.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|I like this game. It's not all that strategic, which could be good or bad, depending on what you like. It is good if you have some time to kill.
B00CDT41RY|5.0|If anyone loves a movie about racial stuff and have some comedy from the black side and white, this movie is for you. I'm mixed and found this movie funny as can be, bad*** and hands down one of the best movies ice ever watched. I recommend it to anyone that can handle racial, cussing ...a rated r movie lol.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|I have yet to meet anyone watching this series say that they do not enjoy it. Excellent programming is a hallmark of Downton Abbey.
B000INAXGU|5.0|I was listening to the Local On the Eights weather report and Jamiroquai's &#34;Canned Heat&#34; was the background music.  I went bonkers!  The only time I have ever heard the song was in &#34;Napoleon Dynamite.&#34;  Canned Heat is one of the best dance songs, right up there with B52's &#34; Love Shack.&#34;  These songs make me jump to my feet and move.  I am not a big fan of all the music.  Their music is diverse.  From jazz to disco to acid funk.  I do enjoy listening to my new cd however, DO NOT listen to Canned Heat before you go to bed.  The song will run through your head all night long and you will experience Restless Leg syndrome! :). Karen
015204907X|4.0|This is a wonderful book and one of my child's favourites.<br /><br />However I was shocked when I picked up a book published in 1982 called the Sheepish Book of Opposites by George Mendoza (published by the entity now known as Penguin).<br /><br />See the link here:<br /><br />http://amzn.to/18ivk0r<br /><br />As I was reading the Sheepish Book of Opposites for the first time I was able to predict the text based on my knowledge of Where is the Green Sheep.<br /><br />Needless to say, this has somewhat dampened my enthusiasm for Where is the Green Sheep.  It seems it is not an original idea.  Disappointing.
B00D37UQ1K|5.0|It's a really good movie from what I see from it. Not at all what I expected when I watched the trailers but its still a good movie in my opinion.
B0044DEAUA|2.0|I purchased this item for my husband who is a truck driver. The sound quality is terrible, much more difficult to hear than just putting your cellphone on speaker mode. Don't bother with this, just use your built in speakerphone so people can actually hear what you're saying.
B00AEFY66U|5.0|One of my favorite movies with Robert Redford!  Instead of having to wait until it comes on TV, I now own the DVD so I can watch it anytime I want!

B00BGIC2J2|5.0|This is by far the funniest movie I've watched in the last year. Hands down a must watch and I recommend it to anyone that is married and or has kids because the Similarity of our life's makes it funny as can be. Watch this movie!!! I'm going to Walmart and buying it as soon as I see its on the shelfs!!
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I enjoyed reading this book very much. Once it got to the life in the orphanage I couldn't put the book down. It is a story that will make you think about how such things can happen and how a person could ever overcome such adversity.
B00AEFY0F2|5.0|I truly believe this is one of the BEST movies ever made.  I never get tired of watching it!  When we have family movie night, this is alway in the que!!

B00B8WXFWE|5.0|I am a loyal New Kids fan and have all of their cd's. I just went to their concert and was reminded that I needed to get their latest cd. Fabulous! Good mix of different types of songs and now I find myself always playing it on my computer when I'm home, and my husband is at work, LOL. You wont be disappointed with this purchase at all
B007SOQBCM|4.0|This app is very good for watching people but it's not as interactive as the app is on the iPod
B00ABLJ5NQ|4.0|From any other Neil's book. Personal and more elusive than the usual, but maybe with a little less bite. Obviously marvellously written.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Absolutely one of the best strategy game's I've ever played. The entire premise is horribly entertaining, and gruesome in its execution, that is to say, YOU are the cause of mankind's extinction....what more could you want for entertainment? I honestly can't say anything bad about this game....could it be flawless??? You'll have to decide for yourself, but for the &quot;pennies&quot; they ask for this game it is unbelievable! (have fun wiping everybody out).
B005WUHAX8|2.0|Would not recommend this product for a young teenager!  We bought this for my daughter and she could not wait to take her phone into our pool.  Well, within a few days, her iphone was water damaged!  Apparently she forgot to plug in the plug where the charger goes, and she got water in the phone.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Its amazing i love this game its the best game i Have ever played i love it!!please make other games like this thank you love Elizabeth

B00AREIAI8|4.0|Nice app. Competitions are nice. Graphics are pretty good. I like that it's animated and not just clicking around. Just wish I could get what I want without spending actual money.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|SUPER COOL GAME TO PLAY. GRAPHICS ARE REALLY COOL MAKES YOU FEEL LIKE YOUR IN THE ACTION. EVEN THOUGH THIS GAME COST A LOT OF MONEY ITS WORTH IT.
B00BHHIWQO|5.0|I heard this game was addictive but it really should come with a warning label!!!!  I love diamond dash and you will too...only try it at your own risk:)!!!!
B006VFLIYK|5.0|I couldn't put this down. Its one of those books that you lose sleep over because you tell yourself, just one more chapter, then I'll go to sleep. I don't mind, though,because I haven't read anything this good in a while and it was a joy to be so intrigued by a story.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|Always good when I find something to read that further unlocks the mystery of me. This book provided great insight as to how I can look at people and adapt  my style to otherish more often. Explains lots of reasons for barriers in life and successes as well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I am a Minecraft fan but I would like Mojang to release the updates on the kindle fire the same time as the Iphone and Ipad. But except for that, Minecraft is the best game ever! I have on the Kindle Fire and the computer.
B009E3EXMU|5.0|Led Zeppelin Led ZeppelinLed Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin Led Zeppelin what more do I need to say!!! LOVE them!!!
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I liked it a lot, even though I did expect something totally different from the title.  I did not see the movie, probably will not since it might be disappointing.
B009WUBERW|4.0|Was a decent action flick. Many cameo stars left and right. Some of the ways they reveal the cameos are way too corny, and just seemed like, \\"Let's just put him here, have him say a couple lines, then send him on his way. By the way, here's your check, see ya later!\\"<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, these are some of my favorite action stars of the '80s and 90s, and it's cool to see them all together in the same film. Character building and evolution is pointless, and the story overall is unoriginal and predictable.<br /><br />If you saw the first one, don't expect much difference, just added action heroes, and more action. Knocked a star for the very corny one liners (which plague nearly half the dialog) and weak references to other movies/television shows.
B005DJREJS|5.0|I love this show. Watched season 1 & 2 in 2 days.<br />Obviously obsessed. This show is Juno meets television.
B009A9EYUO|5.0|I love the way this music sounds on a record player. Be turning the bass up all the way up.
0312427646|3.0|Refreshing and interesting picture of Queen Elizabeth II of England, who discovers a mobile library and becomes enchanted with something that commoners take for granted--reading for pleasure, and discussing literature with others.<br /><br />I smiled a lot, and thought \\"Oh, my, I did not know that\\" a lot. As a librarian I reveled in the fact that an adult could discover the library and become so delighted with what it has to offer. I've also begun to wonder if royals are truly denied the pleasures of discovery and knowledge that books provide? That would be the worst fate that I could dream of! Of course, if true, that would also lead me to wonder how they have maintained a sort of control over what appears to be a logical and intelligent people for so long?<br /><br />This is a delightful read in which I suspect Her Majesty's subject's will find even more to enjoy than an American.
031620157X|5.0|This book es PERFECT I love it. I can't wait for the second part. It's for all kind of people.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|This is a visually challenging game, graphics are better than average for games played on Kindle. The sound effects are spooky, and interactions are pretty neat.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Love it! Takes a little while to load but worth the wait. The kids definitely love playing it. download it
B006LSZECO|2.0|There was no one in this book to like. Everyone was a creep. I like at least one person to hang your hat on and admire.
B001UTW7QU|5.0|I love it! You never know what is going to happen next. Great character development and good story line. It's funy and thrilling and keeps you in seapence
B005544TRQ|5.0|This show is great.  Always leaves you wanting more.  The character development is great and they are people you will relate to.  If you aren't watching it, you should be!
B007SGLZP8|3.0|Not one of his best, but still good. Surprised me with the ending. Not to wait for his next one.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I definitely like this better than the first, though I still don't much care for the writing style. Some words are still overused, but I enjoy the amount of drama within the story. The constant sex is getting tiring.
B003Z49LYO|4.0|If your looking for a well acted and heart hitting movie this definitely is. However, if your a &#34;happy ever after person &#34;this is NOT the movie for you.
B000AJIF4E|4.0|good headphones<br />to mixin aplicationes, to live aplications for all the things that you want<br />sounds very well an cheap costs
B005P1YCNK|4.0|The book gives you some good ideas on how to track whatever it is you want to improve in your life. It also tells you a fact that there's nothing that can't be achieved with hard work.<br />In order to compound something we need work, consistency and it will just be a matter of time for it to explode to proportion you can't imagine.
B00DC7NNAC|5.0|I rented this to watch with my 8 year old daughter and we both loved it.  I feel that there was a lot of backstory that could have been elaborated on a bit more but other than that, it was really a great movie.  Something I didn't expect given how I grew up on the original Wizard of Oz. I would highly recommend this one.
B008EKOIN8|5.0|I really enjoyex thks book. I found myself cooking dishes he was learning with a new found understanding of how to  make the dish unami!
B00CH26TL8|4.0|I played this on facebook for years.  I was so happy to get the app and play directly from my Kindle.  I do have to say, it takes some getting used to with the way you change directions.  On the computer you can just click where you want it but on the Kindle you can't just click, you have to take the time to change direction and then tap to click.  That is the only downfall I found so far.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I literally found myself laughing out loud!  A quick read with lots of funny moments!  Drew is a great storyteller!
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Very impressed with the game play it good me in very quickly.recommended for most players I would say thanx for an awesome game
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I have been avoiding Twitter for a few years...I am now hooked! What a great way to get news!! Love it!
B00280LYHS|5.0|This was the best book I've read in ages coming from an ignorant 11year who hates reading I've been in Italy and can't put down my kindle it is so good this is a book for creative people who would like to learn about Greek mythology and much more.
B00BGIBVP8|3.0|There were quite a few very funny, laugh-out-loud moments in this movie...but overall - I found it depressing!! This is NOT 40 actually. The family is totally disfunctional and I almost couldn't make it through the whole thing :(
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is so much fun to play.  I am anxiously awaiting new levels to pl&aacute;y.  I highly recommend others to get this app.
B00C5W3SBE|5.0|I like all the different movie's that are about the great and powerful OZ what can I say it is just different they when outside the box with this one too.
B003U53GK8|5.0|It never failed to excite my imagination, I never wanted it to end and loved all the characters. Especially Sawyer
B00947N6UG|5.0|This one is out side the box and it give's a reason for Jack Frost how he became that fictional person. My son is 22 and even he liked it.
B00CW665VI|4.0|I had expectations going into the book that it was going to be fantastic. And I felt a bit let down. It was good, but I didn't really like the main character, and felt that some of his ramblings were a bit off. However, it is a fun read and was well-written.
B005LAIH2M|5.0|This movie toldly took me by surprise in a good way. It does not follow the fairy tale other than the father takes them into the woods. They become witch hunters because of the witch that was going to kill them. I can't tell you any more for the ending is out of this word I love it.
0743490304|4.0|Story is compelling and gripping, however it loses punch near the end. Not a great end for a Dan Brown.
B00B0U2SEA|5.0|I did not under stand this movie when it first came out, then I watch it on TV and understood it and fell in love with it. I love owning my  movie's because I have a form of MD and am a shut-in until my son or husband take me somewhere or are out side with me. I read but the books are getting heavy these days so I love watching my movie and this one is so great and Liam Neeson does a great job befriending the Natzie's but but help's the Jewishes comunity by dueing this and free's alot when the Natzie's take over his company. It is a very deep movie.
0312335164|4.0|Was slow to start and then became compelling and stronger, especially near the end. Great End of the book. OK
B003DKJ5ZU|5.0|I am a big fan of Tinker Bell and just a big kid. That and I have 8 grand kids that love Tink. So I collect all her movies they are that good it takes you into just who Tinker Bell is I hope some day they make a movie that lets you know how she became Peter Pan's fairy.
B00005BJ2O|4.0|Really only bought this for 1 song but worth the price of the whole cd.  Love Christina singing on this cd
B007BFSYMS|1.0|No for me this kind of application so erased from my devises. I will look for better ones to this kind.
B005U9REU0|5.0|I have loved David Bowie even before this movie came out a long time ago.  He is a multi-generational figure in my house.
1607066017|5.0|This.  Buy it now. It's gorgeous and engrossing and will leave you wanting more. I can't wait to see where this story goes.
B00BZW5W3W|5.0|OMG...Maysa's Blue Velvet Soul CD is all that and then some!! From the time that I put it in, I couldnt stop listening to it, from the first song to the last. Her sound leaves you wanting for more.  This is my first Maysa CD and I hope her older ones are just as good as this one is, because this one is amazing!!  5 Stars!!
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Why buy an app that charges you money???? This is the best app because this does exactly what you need it to do
B005RJ6AIK|5.0|The movie was very pleasant but I loved the score.  I have played this a thousand times and never get tired of it.  Having lived in Hawaii it is just like being home.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I just wanted the game. So it's almost like temple run and all the other run games and stuff like that.
0765316897|5.0|Sanderson's highly-original fantasy saga regains top marks with the final volume, THE HERO OF AGES.  While the lack of a central antagonist, political squabbles, and loosening of restrictions on the magic system had resulted in a disappointing book two of the series, this one met the high standards we've developed for works of Brandon Sanderson.  In THE HERO OF AGES, the politics are over and the heros are faced with a near-impossible challenge.  Ruin has been released from his prison in the Well of Ascension, and has begun his work to destroy the world.  Ash clogs the air, earthquakes and volcanoes destroy the land, and the mist kills.  As a sentient force, Ruin once again fulfills the role of the story's Great Antagonist, a spot left empty since the death of the Lord Ruler.  The Mistborn series truly comes full circle In this final volume of the trilogy, and by the end of the book you'll feel that you've heard the whole story.  Very few loose ends and a final-seeming conclusion after a solid and resounding finale leave you rewarded and satisfied.<br /><br />Like most Sanderson books, THE HERO OF AGES keeps you guessing with unexpected twists and surprising changes that shift the direction of the story.  The characters continually change, and the challenges they face are not static, but endlessly evolving.  In this book, Vin, Eland, Spook, and Sazed all fully mature, accepting their destinies and the people they need to become if the world is to survive.  Sazed's quest to find the true religion takes center stage in THE HERO OF AGES, and while parts of that effort  become repetitive, the masterful weaving of religion into the core of the story gives this final book something unique from the rest of the series.  Still, strong characters and a wonderfully-developed setting are what earn the Mistborn trilogy a place in the very top of epic fantasy sagas.  Overall, THE HERO OF AGES ranks well ahead of The Well of Ascension and slightly behind The Final Empire.<br /><br />Allomancy, the magic system first described in The Final Empire, helped define Sanderson's new world and vault him up into the top-tier fantasy authors.  The system was so compelling and well-developed as to be described by myself and others as the best magic system in all of epic fantasy.  A system that was defined by strict rules and an almost scientific nature, allomancy was no mystical power that the hero must simply master in order to save the world, but a tool that certain people could use in predictable and limited ways.  In The Well of Ascension, Sanderson focused on the uses and \\"science\\" of feruchemy, the previously-mysterious ability of Terris Keepers to store powers or memories in metal objects.  He also expanded the used of Allomancy, notably with the discovery of duralumin, which in a way removed much of the limits from the magic and made Vin seem completely unstoppable.  In THE HERO OF AGES, a third magic takes the spotlight, that of hemalurgy.  This is a dark magic focused on the transfer of allomantic abilities from one individual to another by the use of a metal spike.  It partially explains the spikes in the eyes of the steel inquisitors, and also gives Ruin the tool he needs to influence the world.  Hemalurgy is another wonderfully well-developed system, and completes the magic system as a whole while explaining some of the mysteries that had persisted since the beginning of the series.<br /><br />While this marks the conclusion to the Mistborn Trilogy, there is another book, The Alloy of Law, set in the same fantasy universe, but taking place a few hundred years in the future of the events from THE HERO OF AGES.  I have not had the pleasure of reading it yet, but judging from the reviews, it is well worth adding to your list of Brandon Sanderson books to read./>Allomancy, the magic system first described in The Final Empire, helped define Sanderson's new world and vault him up into the top-tier fantasy authors.

B000VYX8PE|5.0|It was an amazing book unwound in read it 100 to me s in a row if I could but I have to move ion in the series
B0085YOD1A|1.0|Lame app.no point to it. Id rather eat nails than usr this app. In fact,i might. Ill let you know how that workz out.
B0028MBKVG|5.0|This is an excellent read regardless if you are into running or not. It'll make you think about the human body and what we're capable of doing; of why we go on runs;  and what drives us to move. Hopefully it'll also make you think twice about the aches and pains you get from regular running - whether they're really because we're not built to run that much or that far - or perhaps that we're just wearing the wrong type of footwear and dealing with the wrong issues at hand. Great solid read.
B00DEG4Z1W|1.0|don't waste your time downloading it is not worth it even when it is free.  while it says its free you need to buy almost everything to style the hair
B009KEN87O|5.0|Feeling a little retro? This game might be for you, and it isn't badly priced at over a buck. The levels are challenging, and the bosses will kick your butt! It's just like Galaga!
0525478817|5.0|I loved te reality in this book! John green never disappoints, but I think this one is his best so far.  Great deep read...I am going to get this into my 9th grade English curriculum ASAP!
B0064QNS62|3.0|Well, it is better than the original Mario Bros, graphic-wise. Controls are a pain to figure out. I still slipped now and then after playing for a while. AT least it only cost a buck!
B00BOXZAG6|1.0|Very upset...comes with 2 disc 3D and 2D on same disc, it will not load. I won't do this again !!!!
B004H6G0TI|5.0|Not bad, especially for a buck. It's challenging, nice to look at, smooth, and fun. You dog fight other airplanes while grabbing upgrades so you can nuke those jerks into the afterlife. It's a fun way to pass a little time now and then.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book is the bomb.com! I liked the entire.book, no dislikes at all. Kudos to you Palacio for writing a book who inspired me so much. Everyone check this book out! The Best!
B00BL5EQLC|4.0|This reminds me of games I used to play as a kid. Jump around, pick stuff up, avoid obstacles. It is like those games but with updated graphics. Controls take a bit to get used to. But once you do, it can be a great way to pass the time now and then. If I had anything to complain about, it is the $2 price. There is sooooo much more available out there at half that price. I could have got two games that are just as fun at the same price. Oh, well, I needed to give it a shot.
0446554995|5.0|As always, Pendergast novels are so exciting. Now that I'm Finnish reading this book,<br />I hope the next  one will come soon.
B007N6NGYG|5.0|You've got trains. You've got rails crisscrossing every which way. You've got destinations all over the map. What could possibly go wrong?<br /><br />So, you're the guy/gal controlling the rails while the train operators all blindly follow your lead. If the tracks are pointed the wrong direction, it can spell a recipe for disaster. Not only do you have to find a way to get them all through to their destinations, you also have to act quick on your feet, constantly changing several rail positions very quickly.<br /><br />Good luck!
B003O86FMW|5.0|That was an awesome cliff hanger I can't wait to read the next book, and see how it all concludes!
B006LSZECO|4.0|This is an entertaining novel with a very clever plot structure. The conflicting story lines of the two principal characters makes for a wonderful juxtaposition. I'm impressed and look forward to reading Fynn's other two novels.
B009D0LBRO|5.0|This game is addictive!! It is fun the graphics and music are great. Controls took only a little to get used to but were very easy once we did. My 4 year old son loves it so that doesn't hurt either.
B005QYKE2Y|5.0|Movie delivered quickly and in great condition.  Transformers is a series I very much like to follow and have on hand.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Fun and entertaining it is clever and challenging. Will keep you busy for hours . I was bored and it got me thinking a lot
B0046B1KHG|4.0|Lots of fun.  I loved the girls and the minions! The plot was a little incredible but it was worth watching.
B004LKRR6U|2.0|I just didn't like this Barbie. Mine came damaged so I am in the process of returning it, but even without that issue I think this Barbie is sub-par. She is not nearly as beautiful as Grace Kelly, her nose is really pointy-looking, and her hair is rather gross. I love To Catch A Thief and Grace Kelly and Barbies but this one wasn't for me.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|A masterpiece of science fiction, giving the reader a non-prejudiced philosophy comprising ethics, morals and religion. A very interesting read.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|I never got through this one, not even halfway. Perhaps because the more explicit scenes are fewer and far between. Whatever the reason if you want to stop at book 2 or even book 1, I wouldn't fault you.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Interesting- actually fascinating.  It kept me guessing about the next twist and turn until the very end.  Good summer read- I recommend it!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|It is rather embarrassing to admit but I really enjoyed this book. Is it a literary wonder? No. Is it absolutely fantastic escapism? Yes! If you want to know what everyone is talking about or if you just need a quick, titillating read, this is for you. But I don't recommend reading it in public...which is why the Kindle version was perfect for me, only Amazon knows my secret.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|great for kids like me..... and is a great book for eveyone very funny . and just awsome i recomend
B007IXWKUK|4.0|This sequel is not nearly as much fun as the first, but you learn more about Christian and his past. The extras are still fun and enjoyable.
B00CW6DAKC|4.0|Well I was able two play for 24 hrs now says need to update to play but....kindle has NO update for this game wth!! fun but cannot play anymore:( plz update asap Mindanao dumb cannot play even when no update is available. I will keep for a few days but getting rid of if no update by then.
B00D1DBO1C|2.0|Why is it so difficult to sync it to Google calender?  Without that its useless to me.  Needs better integration
B0064X7FVE|2.0|I liked this app much better before the recent changes.  It used to be much simpler to use, precise and to the point.  Now it is full of unnecessary junk and difficult to navigate.  It used to be that with a swipe of my finger I could check the weather of all my saved locations.  Now not so much.  My search for another weather app has begun.  I'm very disappointed.
B006GWO5NE|5.0|This product was ordered in addition to the Kindle Powerfast for Accelerated Charging plug-in because I was having trouble charging my Kindle Fire.  Every since I have received the items, charging has been easy and quick.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|this game is so cool and I love the dragongs and maybe lower the dragon price. This is a game of fun it is great so get it.
B005D4YOWI|5.0|They arrived on time, AND THEY FIT!!! I bought these as a gift for my husband, because I love mine so much. He wears them everyday and that's saying a lot.
B009DALSSG|1.0|Never got to try the thing out because of the \\"wonderful\\" packaging. After cutting off the top of the plastic case, I discovered that I had cut the cable. What it was doing up there, instead of being tucked safely behind the controller, I have no idea. A warning would have been nice.
B00DGNO3WE|3.0|Sometimes I felt so sorry for threse elderly musicans.  They were interesting people and probably not unlike many retired musicans.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|Neil Gaiman always amazes me as a novelist, comic writer and movie score adapter. This time, though, he went off the scale. I've read this book twice, and I bet I'll discover new unspotted details when I read it for the third time. Serious Hugo runner up.
B0046B3QTG|4.0|I chose four stars because it made me laugh<br />and had a good story line. Can't wait to see the next one!
098555780X|5.0|Before I got this book, I could make a basic cobra weave bracelet.<br /><br />Inside are different weave patterns for bracelets and straps.  All plas are well layed out and the pictures walk you through the steps to create your project.  I'm looking forward to working my way through the book.
B0049VVE7Y|5.0|Gotta love zombies.  Great story line and action.  Characters are believable and easy to identify with.  Unlikely heroes and villains.
1781162646|2.0|I can't quite see how King admitted to actually writing this drivel.  It certainly wasn't on of his best efforts and it was quite tedious to plow through.
B00A757EFW|4.0|I love this game and this phone version is lots of fun. It will never be like a arcade version in real life but it is still pretty fun. THANKS!
1594746168|2.0|This was an incredibly boring read and while the title and contents looked quite interesting in the end it was too much of a fantasy to concentrate on.
1594744769|5.0|Someone somewhere called this book &#34;Alice in Wonderland meets Harry Potter,&#34; and that's actually a pretty accurate I think. Plus a little bit of X-Men.<br /><br />SPOILERS abound! But I'll try not to give too much away.<br /><br />This was definitely one of the best books I've read in a while, if not all year. Ransom Riggs did a phenomenal job combining peculiar pictures with a peculiar story without making anything seem too farfetched. I think what made it even better was the inclusion of real events and real places. He takes an old man's stories of monsters and magical places and peculiar children and constantly switches between fantasy and the reality of WWII.<br /><br />Jacob, as a character, is both simple and extraordinarily complex. As a child, he takes his grandfather's story at face value and although he believes them to be mostly fairy tales, he doesn't take them to be metaphors for his grandfather's wartorn history. As he gets older, he begins to dismiss the stories and believes everything to be simply his grandfather's method of coping with all of the horrors he dealt with as a child.<br /><br />Then suddenly, Jacob's world in turned upside down when his grandfather is killed. He tries to figure out his grandfather's past, but learns so much more. All of the new children, Miss Peregrine, and all of the other characters are mysterious and peculiar, and Riggs does an excellent job of creating characters based on real, odd photos.<br /><br />I am so excited for a sequel and a Tim Burton movie! Definitely a 5/5 on this book! Even if it wasn't entirely original, I still loved it all the way through.
B008OOYALE|4.0|I love this game because you can create and breed so many dragons. It's colors and very cute dragons makes it fun to see and mostly play.
0061726826|5.0|As a whole, Delirium more than exceeded my expectations. Not knowing anything about the author or the book before diving head first into it, I wasn't really expecting much. Just a nice YA story about some girl in a dystopian society beating the system. However, this wasn't your typical &#34;girl is happy in society, girl meets boy, girl realizes society is bad, girl falls in love with boy, girl and boy run away together&#34; story. There's much more depth to the characters without making them too complex, and the descriptions of the society and how it ended up the way it is are concise and to the point. Not much time is wasted in describing the scenery or anything, and the story flows well.<br /><br />To the people of Lena's world, love is a disease - &#34;amor deliria nervosa&#34; - and is one of the most deadly diseases. It is &#34;the deadliest of all deadly things: It kills you both when you have it and when you don't.&#34; (p. 4). Lena believes this, and what she has been taught, and cannot wait to have the procedure to make her immune to this illness. However, like every teenager, Lena gets caught up in a rebellious streak and ends up wanting to fight the system because she begins to doubt it. The book chronicles her journey from unthinking teenager who believes everything she's told to a thinking individual capable of making her own decisision and fighting for her right to love (after falling in love herself, of course).<br /><br />The ending of the book is not entirely predictable either, which is nice. And definitely not common in a YA novel. It's also interesting that, although Delirium is the first of a trilogy, the novel could also be a standalone. I definitely want to read the next two books in the series when they come out, but had Lauren Oliver decided to not write the other two, I'd also be ok with that.<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this book for anyone who enjoys YA novels, but wants to read something a little different from the typical ones that are out there right now.nes that are out there right now.
B00CM9JL4S|5.0|As a die-hard life-long (loyal) Metallica fan, I compare this album by Orphaned Land to Metallica's Black Album. Where as Metallica came from artistic works such as Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and Justice For All to the Black album, which honestly threw many of their fans for an unwanted curve ball, Orphaned Land has released a more simplistic, streamlined sound with All Is One. This may send some of the die hard fans from the beginning into a bit of a tizzy, but it's likely to appeal to a whole new market of new fans.<br /><br />Simply put, the production on this album slays all of the previous albums. You can crank it up to full volume and it will still sound awesome. The album art and concept is brilliant in my opinion. The band is so brave to stand behind this message of oneness and unity that is what the world so desperately needs. I don't think many neo nazis will be purshasing this album if you know what I mean. But if you have an open mind and an open heart, and like metal, you will love it. The guitars are phenomenal. One thing I do prefer about the simplicity of this album as compared to some of their previous works, which are simply put mind boggling and amazing, is that there are no long interludes between songs that one has to hear before the song actually starts. While I do appreciate that from time to time, it soon becomes tedious to me and I just want to hear the frikkin song. Well All Is One has certainly trimmed the fat so to speak!<br /><br />The opening track befittingly \\"All Is One\\" is so jubilant and full of life that it actually makes me drive faster. Also, it's in a crazy odd time signature, yet has the potential for a hit song.. not an easy thing to accomplish. My personal favorite track is \\"Let the Truce Be Known\\". This song while seemingly slow, is actually the perfect tempo and is so inspirational and emotional. No other band can accomplish a song like that... I'm sorry.. they just can't.<br /><br />Their is a certain maturityrequired to be an Orphan Land fan. Not only must you be a peace-loving human (sad to say not everyone is).. but also you must let their songs seep into your understanding. Upon first listen you won't always 'get it'... but with some patience and time, they will grow on you like a new best friend.<br /><br />I must say this.. to anyone who is purchasing All Is One as their first Orphaned Land album, you simply MUST go back and pick up Mabool, and The Neverending Way of the OrWarriOr. Those are two MUST HAVE albums... literally! Similar to someone who bought Metallica's Black Album first... wouldn't you just insist to them that they pick up Ride The Lightning, Master of Puppets, and And Justice For All??????
B004S5FWEC|5.0|David Baldacci hardly needs anyone like me reviewing his work. He is an excellent writer & this is an excellent series, if a little slow to get moving romantically. I think it's about the fourth book before they finally 'get it on' and even then, there is no real mention of it afterward. I will continue reading the series though, as I like familiarity in my characters.
B009GEEMLY|5.0|We loved it even having no background from following the comic books. Great story, characters, effects and action sequences and enough humor to keep it light.
1451626088|4.0|I liked the book because it portrayed the characters from a personal viewpoint.  Also I was surprised to read Elizabeth Rivers' portrayed in an entirely different light than I'd previously read in other books.  This novel also portrayed King Richard differently than I'd read in the past also.  I found all this variance very enlightening and it gives a person a completely different perspective of what may have transpired during this period in English history.
B003730LRY|4.0|The Addams Family mixes silly and slap-stick with dark and morbid to make a very entertaining movie for all ages.
B000FC1RCI|5.0|I hate the new edition. Why do we have to be so politically correct all the time . It should not have been changed to Soldier or in some cases Patriot Island !! I agree that the original British title  would have been offensive( and  if  you  don't  know  what it is  look it  up  ) but that change was ok. Cant we leave a classic alone the way it was written  and enjoyed  for years ?  Other than that  this is a GREAT novel and one of my faves. 10 people brought to an Island and killed off 1 by one by their mysterious host !!  Just when you think you know who the killer is  , another murder occurs and  changes you mind about  who the killer is
B007TNS6JI|5.0|DH3 is a well built game.  There's no waiting for time to lapse before continued play.  It's easy to learn and fun to play.
B009ZXT4BY|5.0|Love this game.  The more you build, the more you want to create.  I like it because my world is limitless.
B0099RFVXQ|3.0|The opening nearly caused us to turn it off but we stuck it out and weren't disappointed. Iron Man is still the best character, but overall an entertaining movie without much to remember.
B00BI73CVI|5.0|Magnificent story of people struggling to get on in a messy world. Each character offers an emotional look at choices to do or not do the right thing, as it is complicated by the brutal realities of life. Powerful and moving music and performances by everyone.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|A friend said I should read this book, and not knowing the first thing about cricket I wasn’t sure, but I decided to give it a go. I was hooked in the first few pages by the outrageous character of Gabriella, a haughty heart breaker who developed to be a brillilantly crafted character. She is so outrageous that I couldn’t help but admire her!<br /><br />The story is played out over one day on a cricket field, and is essentially a contest of the upper and lower classes (or the criminal classes as Gabriella calls them). Gabriella meets and falls for the boy of her dreams (but not of her class), Jim, at the cricket match.<br /><br />Having set the stage of the cricket field, and having filled it with such a mix of outrageous and starkly contrasting characters, the author runs riot with humour, sex, conflct and prejudice. The characters are very well drawn, and I especially liked Jim’s celebrity obsessed parents and Garbiella’s long suffering butler, Chivers.<br /><br />This is a highly original story, one that speeds along at a very lively pace, and is filled with many laugh out loud moments. Recommend.
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|I got it and it was really slow and kept saying I needed wifi when I had wifi but it was a fun game over all. You only get to play it for like 2 days and that was frustrating butover a great game.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I'm a fan of green's novel \\"Looking For Alaska\\", but this novel was absolutely amazing. It takes you through an emotional life of two teenagers battling cancer, and finding meanings of love and loss. TFIOS will make you smile, and cry, and maybe feel some butterflies as you read of true love between star-crossed lovers. John Green is a fantastic author, and I'd definitely recommend this book to anyone.
B000Y90VO2|5.0|Sometimes it's good to escape from all of the pressures of everyday life and immerse oneself into silly humor just for the sake of humor.
B002LFPAUC|5.0|Fawlty Towers is comic genius in it's highest form. To appreciate much of the show, you must be willing to see subtle humor and irony at it's best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|title says it all. its a good game and that's really all need to know. its also free so yeah get it.
0143117009|3.0|Interesting though it has some scare tactics that are over the top. It's a good beach book if you are interested in one person's opinion about the end of the American economic system.
B0043JDUNS|5.0|I enjoyed watching this movie for the second time. I also saw the first Iron Man before watching this one.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|A man comes to his father's funeral in Sussex, and then drives back to his long-lost house. Only an old farm at the end of the lane remains of the neighborhood he remembers, and there, beside a pond, which a girl that lived there called an ocean, he starts to remember.<br />&#34;American Gods&#34; is still my Gaiman's favorite novel, but &#34;The Ocean&#34; comes very close, and it's clearly his best in terms of language, atmosphere and depth. It is also his most personal book, and probably even one of the most personal, touching, and bittersweet books I had ever read. Gaiman masterfully mixes memories of the 60-s in a Sussex middle-of-English-nowhere town, with his usual strange parallel magical next-door world of wise child-witches, strange monsters, doors, coins, and moons, but it is more of a book, about that innocent part of childhood, when even death and family troubles are still not fully understood, remembered by a man for whom innocence and childhood is a long lost and forgotten thing.<br />And the most wonderful thing about the &#34;The Ocean at the End of the Lane&#34; that it captures some ethereal part of what being a child is, and opens a door to half-forgotten memories of my own summers near Moscow, of old trees at which I played, first bikes, best friends which moved to other since and imagined worlds which are still somewhere out there.<br />Thank you, Neal.
B001KZG99A|5.0|I enjoy watching it over again, just like the first time. I cannot wait to see the next Iron Man 3
B004ZN9UZO|5.0|I'm a huge Floyd fan and rate this at the top along with Wish You Were Here and The Dark Side of the Moon. Really any one of those three could be my favorite on any given day. I find it mildly amusing that any Pink Floyd would even suggest this is average. For me this is the pinnacle of David Gilmour on the guitar, something only rivaled possibly in Comfortably Numb. I love this album becuase in many ways it is the most unique offering and although it is only three long songs bookended by a short into and outro the album has an incredible flow to it. Truly one that you can listen to from start to finish like DSOTM or WYWH. Wailng guitars with incredible fade effects and everyting else right on the money. This is a must for any serious Pink Floyd fan. Speaking of the mastering, I had the old original CD and eventally it got a scratch and skipped on Dogs so I had to get the new one. Happy with the mastering job, it may be a little brighter but still sounds absolutely great to my ears. I've heard the old vinyl as well which sounded incredible but I never really did a side by side comparison. This is five star mind blowing Pink Floyd all the way!!!
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|My kids and I loved watching it for the second time this year. I can't wait to see the next Despicable Me 2 movie
B003MC5N28|5.0|This book was one that I chose as a summer reading for one of the students I tutor. Both the student and I really enjoyed reading The Giver.  In fact, my student asked each week if reading further was okay with me.<br />This is very well written.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|THIS GAME WAS A GREAT APP FIR THE MINIONS. I LOVE HOW IT USED SOUNDS AND VOICES FROM THE MOVIE!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I am totally caught up in the Crossfire novels.  I anticipated the release of this novel as I will the next in this series.  I have read all of the &#34;Fifty Shades&#34; series and although I like them that whole S & M just doesn't do it for me.  The Crossfire novels in my opinion were sexy with a really great love story.
0061730335|4.0|I liked it because I have met some of the people talked about in this book and know some of the places. I wanted to read about it and get some others to read about an ingenious young man.
0399159347|5.0|This book has so many crossed threads between characters - it must've taken the author forever to weave it all together.  The story is actually a rotation between 3 main characters' individual stories.  Cecelia finds her husband's secret letter (with a life-altering revelation inside), Tess is betrayed by her best friend and husband, and Rachel grieves a long dead daughter because the killer was never caught.  Oddly, even though these sound unrelated, there are many ties that bring these lives together at unexpected intersections.<br /><br />At first I thought it was a little wordy and I wanted the story to get on with it.  However, after the second chapter I realized that the author was simply providing a clear outline of each main character's personality and situation.  There were some funny internal thoughts by these characters that are so true (in real life) but go unsaid for many reasons.  This was a quick read; it is a page turner at times but mostly just pleasant entertainment.  In the end, it seems that several deeds (good, bad and unmentionable) come full circle. The author does not leave you wondering what happened or making up your own afterward.<br /><br />Recommend!
B00992CF6W|4.0|Minecraft pe is a good game.the only thing wrong with it is that 7.3 is out and Amazon won't get the UPDATE .IF YOU WANT A GOOD GAME WITH BETTER ITEMS THAN MINECRAFT PE PAY 4 DOLLARS FOR SURVIVAL CRAFT BUILD ELECTRONIC DEVICES AND MORE BY danielguerreroangel
B00DF0POXA|1.0|Kanye West returns with his anticipated follow-up to the well received My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy (or whatever it was called). Music critics love this album, as Kanye has added some even darker production and some system-baiting lyrics to go along with his random, graphic sexual fantasies. Frankly, I don't get it.<br /><br />This is possibly the worst major label release in the history of the industry. Spotty production from an overmatched wannabe to the industrial music scene, anyone who claims this is quality in that department is making a relative statement. It's quality in the sense that there is no other major label rap/hip hop record that tried to broach industrial/non-mainstream EDM, thus it is the best album ever in the genre. Out of 1 total, it is number 1.<br /><br />But even if you do give the production the benefit of the doubt, there's always the lyrics. A notoriously mediocre wordsmith, Kanye (if you can believe it), actually regressed for this release. Awful rhymes, poor attempts at shocking the audience, flailing at trying to seem worldly, and a complete disrespect for women shine through this half-baked garbage. It's not a good sign when you call Rick Rubin in a month before the release date to try and make your songs better. Unfortunately, not even he could save this from being a coaster for whatever alcoholic beverage you are funneling into your gullet to try and forget how bad this sounds. For whatever reason, \\"critics\\" like Pitchfork and Entertainment Weekly love this album and have decided to give it stellar grades, passing up on the reality of what is going on here. Do yourself a favor, stick with reality and pass on the album instead. Your ears will thank you.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Hunger games have to be the best books I have ever read.once I start I can't stop, the thrill and excitement of the story is overwhelming. In a good way that is!
B00B5JVXYC|4.0|Downloaded this because it was free and interesting.  Started playing and got hooked, introduced my wife to it and she was hooked too.
B005LLX582|5.0|I like a movie that dares to be serious. Tree of Life insists on going grand, with its meditations on the creation and the morning of the first resurrection, yet holds just as fiercely to its naturalism--the mundane as not-so-mundane. The resulting juxtaposition, from the suggestion at the beginning of the DVD to play it at a loud volume, to it's deep passions and compassions, to its formal experimentation reminds me very much of James Agee's masterpiece, Let Us Now Praise Famous Men.<br /><br />The everyday struggles of Jack and his family ring true, as do the wisps of thoughts given under his breath throughout as soliloquies of the id, and later the enlightened human being. It is shocking to us and his to father when some of these mind-mutterings are spoken out loud.<br /><br />Of course, being a made by Terrence Malick, Tree of Life it is lovely to look at, but that beauty serves to enlighten, enliven, and enlarge the soul. As Wallace Stevens urges, it does indeed \\"speak humanly from the height [and] from the depth of human things\\".
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|When I read this book I was surprised that the German pilot's story was included, but with that I was able to see that each person was just doing his job. War is Hell. To find some humanity in it is a wonderful thing. One thing that I did not realize was that most of the Germans were not members of the Nazi party. The Nazi party won 40% of the vote, and a lot of that was by what would now be illegal means. The rest of the votes were spread out enough that the bad guys won. Then those same bad guys removed any means to appose them. Then the propaganda machine did the rest. History is written by the winners, so it was good to read about what happened to the losers who were just doing their job.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|It is very rare that a series comes around that gets you so connected to the individual characters that you feel you know them.  Downton is one of those classic series.  I can't wait until the new episodes come out.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I enjoy listening to Loreena McKennitt, so when I found this album I had to have it. It is not as good as some of her ther, more famous albums, but it is still worth having and enjoyable to listen to.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|the mark of athena is another great book writen by rick roadain. I cant wait to read the next book the house of hades.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I really like this game. Its easy to pick up and the music is relaxing. I recommend you picking this up after all its free. What are you going to lose?
B002RWKSII|5.0|Brian Wilson gets a chance to show how Gershwin influenced his work and in the process honors Gershwin's music at the same time. I would have loved more of the vocal treatment given on the short &#34;Rhapsody In Blue&#34; intro, but the album is beautifully and lovingly rendered by one Great American Master in tribute to another.
B005HSL626|4.0|This game is fun but its harder than it looks. All the unlockables look interesting so gotta keep playing to get them. Check this out.
B000X2H8G4|2.0|The microphone is so sensitive that it creates noise on its own if not perfectly still. Works well outdoors without the mic. slip cover.<br />I would not recommend this for inside home use. Listening to birds was fun though!
1616550414|5.0|For any Legend of Zelda fan Get This Book! The artwork is great and it goes over the timeline so you know where every game in the series took place in relation to the history of Hyrule. Can't recommend this enough.
B007N8RULO|3.0|I downloaded this game because I like to play it on my computer.  The Kindle version is ok except for the fact that if I have more than one option to move to, I can't pick, the game picks for me.  Otherwise it's OK.
B005Y423ZC|5.0|Adele's live! What can go wrong with this~ the voice and music is just phenomenal!<br />Totally adore all the songs!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|It is free. It works well. It's fun! It has a lot more play than I thought it would. Something for a car ride!
B00003CXRP|5.0|This is one of my husband's favorite movies. There are so many ways in which you can compare life experiences with what the main character is going through. I wanted the two-disc special because of the interviews and commentaries that are included.
B00BB8RKH6|3.0|Was expecting an airplane crash investigation film, but really it's more of an Alcoholics Anonymous film. Not that made it bad, it was still enjoyable, just not what I was expecting or desiring.
B0012DP8A6|5.0|enough said, this movie is and always will be a classic, I could watch it over and over again, Had to share it with my son
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this is really cute , i love the minions, I highly recommend getting this game u will like it. ^_^
B000JMKQX0|5.0|If you haven't read this, you're missing out. That's all.<br />If you are a true Z fan, this is for you.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|It won't let me play.  You have to wait so long for a time to play and then they want you to buy junk.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I love this game.  The scenery and the run is different each time, makes it not monotonous. I get playing and don't want to put it down. I do not regret downloading this game.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|There are Awesome graphics and details in this game. It's a lot of Fun and keeps you entertained! It challenges you with out being difficult so it can be played by all ages
1616550414|5.0|If you are a Legend of Zelda lover or a Graphic Designer involved on editorial design you are going to love this book, it is beautifully finished and the materials are great.

B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love this game!! :) This is a family game.The whole family can join in together. 4 at a time!!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I really love this bingo game. I love that it calls bingo for you after you have dab it. Unfortunally, you have to pay extra for it to dab for you.
B0096DFBZQ|1.0|This game isn't worth at least 3 stars. Its very boring and the controls are hard to use. You can barely get past level one! I don't suggest this game AT ALL!
B0089XH38M|4.0|has worked well for my smartphone. Good antivirus app for any moblie device and it is free! Free! Free! Free!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is my favorite game in all time! You build and use your creativity to make whatever you want! It may not be the computer version, but it still is lots of stuff, and Is very easy to work! I promise you will love this game! Who ever gave this one star must of written their review on opposite day! You have to buy it!
B0006Z2KYI|4.0|You don't see jack Benny movies very often.  He was in many ways what he was on TV but the story was fun and very well written.  Carole Lombard's last film demonstrates why she was so good.  Definitely worthwhile.  Mel Brooks did a parody of this in 1983 I believe.  See this first if you are going to be seeing that.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|When o saw this game I was like Omg I watched the two movie and loved them and I love this too!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|can you escape was hard challeging and fun.  cant wait for more levels to come. you will enjoy<br />for hours.

0788859536|4.0|Love this film... my daughter does too... only thing was the disc was not secure in the case and arrived floating all over the case. Does not appear to be scratched or damaged but I was worried.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I enjoy this game,  however I wish the energy would last longer . Also it tries to force close when I first open it and I have to choose the &quot;wait &quot; option in order to get it to load properly
B00CLD65X0|5.0|There were a lot of twists and turns that I really did not expect. I think the character development and plot direction are very interesting. Can't wait for season four!!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a really fun game but it really hard to get gems to do you can't do much with it gems but the competitions are fun and the house outfits are really cute but after a while it gets hard to level up if too don't buy things with real money
B005SS2QXS|5.0|This case is a perfect balance between accessibility and protection. Some cases are too protective and make it a hassle when you want to plug it in and charge it or simply play music. On the other hand you have cases that provide no protection for the screen and just cover the back. All the buttons and ports are easily accessible and at times it is hard to even imagine why apple wouldn't sell this case with the phone. This is honestly the ideal case the rubber protection also makes it very adhesive to surfaces and not likely to slip off something but even if it does you have no need to worry cause nothing is denting a iphone with this case on. The company also provide a one year warranty!No extra fees just a great company that wants to be there for its customers. If you happen to be reading these comments you are obviously a bit hesitant. Don't be this case will honestly save you a great sum of money in the long run. The case is so compatible with the phone and such a great price that you would think all the stars and planets have aligned to give such a wonderful blessing. Don't miss out!

B001EBV0OY|5.0|when you wake up on sat. or sun. & it's raining!! this is a movie to grab along with popcorn and blanket
B001DJLCPE|5.0|Some movies are icons of the times and this still is relevant.  When I originally saw it many, many years ago I did not view it as the anti-war/nuclear weapon statement it was.
B00C33M2EE|5.0|I love The Piano Guys.  This is a great CD.DVD.  I would recommend this CD to all who like piano and cello music.  These guys are talented.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|Revise the app using the old version as a starting point.  The new version cannot be &quot;improved&quot; only scraped.  It is hard to navigate and extremely slow.
B00AQL8VU4|3.0|This is an OK app for the Samsung tablet, a little hard to move around with, not user friendly. I guess you can not complain to much for free.
0312330537|5.0|Partly because I just identify with the story so much, it's perfect for my liking, but Mr Roberts writes so beautifully that even if you we're 'meh' on the subject matter, this is still an amazing read.

0345529057|5.0|Having watched the Game of Thrones series avidly so far, I wanted to seek out the books upon which it was based and see how they compared. They do not disappoint! This is a tale of truly epic proportions and I have devoured the first two books in as many weeks. The series does a pretty good job following the first book faithfully, but from book two it soon becomes obvious that the sheer number of characters and scenes could not possibly have been transferred to the screen without making a series with umteen seasons. With that in mind, the additional depth that the books offer, serves to further enrich the screen adaptation further. If you don't read the books you simply cannot appreciate the sheer scale of the work that has been undertaken by George R.R. Martin. Expertly crafted fantasy classics that I would recommend to anyone. The only problem is that once you have read them, you will forever by muttering to yourself disapprovingly at the TV series. That's not what happens! That happens to someone else! That isn't what she is supposed to look like... etc.<br />I realise there is now a 5th book that has been released and will definitely buy that installment when I am done with these. Top notch entertainment.
1781162646|5.0|As with most of Stephen Kings work, I loved it. It kept you interested all the way thru. King still is one of the masters of horror and suspense.
B004XWLIJS|3.0|Have enjoyed most of Jason Statham movies and this is no exception. If you're looking for an action packed movie this is one.
B0095VP8D4|5.0|I am using this for an HTPC. It is very snappy and the graphics are great. I have an i5-3570k in another HTPC, and I can tell you that with the integrated graphics on the APU, I can tell a difference. I am sure the CPU tasks are better on the i5, but HTPC, light gaming, this is the way to go.<br /><br />I bought an after market CPU Cooler, Cooler Master GeminII M4. The stock cooler seemed ok. Wish I had tried it first. It is much larger than the i5 cooler, but doesn't seem as well constructed. I have read it was loud, that is why I got the GeminII M4.<br /><br />HTPC build:<br />Silverstone GD05 USB 3.0<br />XFX 550W Pro<br />ASROCK FM2 Pro4-M<br />AMD A10-5800k<br />G.Skill Sniper 2133 8GB<br />Samsung 840 120GB SSD
B009ZQJ0ME|3.0|it is just  an OK movie! I am not moved by this at all. Too much unreal things!<br />You may like it but I don't.
B00C7NKPPS|5.0|If you like McCartney's solo career you must get it. They've done a great work remastering this album, if you have an old mp3 sound of this,compare both and you'll realize. In the other way it's a simple edition, there's no too much information inside, not even lyrics, just a few pages booklet.<br />Great shipping! It arrived on time.
B0012PDVQ2|1.0|I've seen a lot of cuts of this film.  I like the film.  I don't like this cut.  Is it the producer's cut?  It seems less interested in the film than in the money spent on it.
B005EGXTEE|5.0|I am a believer that you must read the book before seeing the movie however, in this case the movie had me intrigued! I thoroughly enjoyed this book and instantly hunted down the second and third upon completing them.
B00CW665VI|5.0|I've never laughed so much and so hard reading a book! It has a great storyline and awesome characters. They are so believable and so well built. I wish it were translated to Portuguese so I could tell my friends to read it!

1457514508|4.0|Colorful characters that keep you guessing...mysterious locked doors...phony friendships...memories of days gone by...and a hit man. A whole neighborhood of seemingly normal folks; each one with their own secrets and hidden agenda. This book will keep you guessing until the very end. Recommended for anyone who enjoys a good murder mystery, peppered with bits of dark humor. I enjoyed every minute of it!\\"
B00DJFIMW6|4.0|This game is really cute. I like pretty much all things about it. It's addicting. :) :) :) love love love it!!
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Enjoyed this book immensely.  Wonderful story telling with in-depth character development.  Wish there were more Hosseini novels out there for me to read.
0451529065|4.0|I planned to read The Origin Of Species long ago.<br />The motive was to finally see for myself what this famous author preached.<br />Since every natural history movie is referencing Darwin, i thought i's kind of obligatory to be acquainted with his most monumental work.<br /><br />My expectations were largely met, even to an extent which i didn't expect.<br />The theory of Natural Selection is explained so thoroughly and clearly, and objections are so professionally dealt with, it leaves no doubt whether the theory's true.<br /><br />Apart from this detailed explanation, some curious cases from kingdoms of animals, fishes, birds and insects caught my attention, of which i could not hear from anywhere else. This added a lot to my being satisfied with this work.<br /><br />I enjoyed The Origin Of Species a lot.<br />Still, there's one thing which made it hard for me to keep concentrated on the subject. It's the language and the complex expressions used by author. I would abort the reading if my initial interest in studying the theory was not so strong.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|What a classic. It has everything you'd expect from some of the best actors in the world. Very funny. A must see.

B009KKLQVS|4.0|I've long been a Beach Boys fan all through their career and had carefully read the other \\"mixed\\" reviews on this DVD before buying it. While it does include 2 or 3 songs I had never heard of (and have no idea why they included those songs in the 21 in the DVD) the overall production & quality of the blue ray DVD is superb.<br /><br />I attended their 50th concert tour in April of 2012 in the Dallas area and it was a lifetime rememberance.  I love the DVD and will play it often as it contains \\"most\\" of their very best known songs.
B00CLZ4B4I|5.0|Much scarier than the original.  My granddaughter loved it and talked me into it.  I have nothing more to say.

B00CTEP7O4|5.0|I am enjoying this show tremendously.  The characters are interesting, the dialog is witty, and the two leads are a joy to watch interacting.
B000GCFX3Q|4.0|Love the Walsh series! Every sister and mom and dad are hilarious.  Write more about the Walsh family Marian! I read them all more than once!
B003G4W49C|4.0|Looking forward to the movie.  on bk2 now.<br /><br />I Do Not Rate more items in Amazon because I don't always have something to say, yet they require it and thereby forego my review.
B009NFHF0Q|5.0|this book made me remember what is like to be a helpless frightened child.I Don't say that lightly. The only way I can describe this book is to call it Stirring.
B00C2U6G7C|5.0|I love the suble nuances of Hans Zimmer's work. I wasn't ready for his take on &#34;Man of Steel&#34; Though radically different from what everyone has grown up with, the music and theme are completely fresh and new in thier interpretation of pop culture's most recognizable icon. Science fiction and Epic meet in this soundtrack and it is awesome!
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This app is so fun I would've paid for it.it is<br />GREAT !!! I hope everyone else has the same like me or better than it if you can.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This album took a little more time to sink in. But in time I was able to interpret the groups' attempt to infuse the soul of those classic 70's and 80's rock ballads and classic rythyms that I fell in love with it and the nostalgia that it inspires in me. Way to go brothers, you crafted another classic.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is exactly what you want to get if you're into swords, magic etc. Highly addictive and great fun. Don't get me wrong you do have to pay for buying more gems and stuff but its worth every penny if you decide to do so. Best free game I've seen in a long time. Keep up the good work guys.
1781162646|4.0|I have to start by saying I was very apprehensive about this book - I was extremely non-plussed about \\"The Colorado Kid\\" and hoped against hope that this offering was better. And you know what? It was!<br /><br />It sure wasn't really a \\"Hard Case Crime\\" novel - they are usually pretty gritty, action packed stories. This wasn't. However, the lingering presence of the crime/s was enough to keep me interested.<br /><br />The ending, while not overly exciting, did the job.<br /><br />BUT the man can tell a story. Regardless of its genre, publisher, title...it doesn't matter. The man writes books that I want to read. And that is enough for me. I liked the characters (in such a small book, getting them right isn't easy), the carny-speak was fun and the story of Devin's life was an interesting background to the story.
B0070BG10U|5.0|What a beautiful piece of work and I would recommend it to any lover of good music.  I listen to it often.  I especially liked Robin Gibb's &#34;don't cry alone&#34; song, he sang like an angel.
0307279189|1.0|I tried to read this book on three different occasions, but I ended up tossing it in the trash. Most of what I remember from the book seemed to be exaggerations.
B000Z1LOBI|5.0|Def a different kind of Testament Album...they most definitely went in a more &#34;Demonic&#34; direction.  Perfect name for this CD.  If you love Testament then this IS A MUST HAVE to your collection
B0002F6AH0|5.0|This is an excellent summary of the history of WWII, with no glamor or militarism.  Although not overly graphic, it's enough to make a pacifist out of anybody.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I like it a lot because is tricky  and make you think. I hope the have more rooms to keep playing.
1892005034|5.0|This book has so many virtues, even in light of contemporary psychology. It gives a simple (though difficult) re-frame for most of the thoughts that bug us and impair fluid communication. My biggest complaint is that the focus of the book is heavy on what to say, whereas I wish it were heavier on what to think. But if you take what it says to say as what to think, it succeeds nicely.
B004PGO25O|5.0|This book was written very well and l am completely pleased  with it. I would encourage ANYONE who has a history of fear an not completing projects of any kind that this book is a MUST READ. It's eye opening if you're ready to pick up the pieces an Do The Work.
B005K17RU0|1.0|I really do not like the new set up. I liked it much better before. I am going to look for another application for weather on my kindle fire.
B00DHSK3RM|5.0|Candy  Crush is an amazing game,their is nothing you can compare it to. I found out that their a game called Candy Crush Crush when my show went on commercial break.I like that you can get lives when you connect to face book.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|we loved this game, very entertaining and challenging yet not too hard that we would give up.  cant wait till the next set of rooms are available

I think we're the only ones who have a tablet in church...I don't think we'll be for very long tho...it's a small church...<br />I can't say enough about the AWESOMENESS of this BIBLE...Merci...for giving it to us for free...also...
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I agree with most views here with the recent update. I used this app everyday with the previous version on my Kindle Fire. I tried to get used to the update but could not get used to it. I have now bookmarked a webpage of local tv station weather.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Excellent. The characters were real, and it was easy to see yourself in the people and the stories Charlie described.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|I have had fun with this games the graphics are great for a tablet game and it is perfect to play while the kids and I are on road trips can waittotrytheother ones
B00992CF6W|5.0|Best game ever<br /><br />If u want to get mods texture packs skins realms on this game then get block launcher pro
B009APMNB0|4.0|I use this on two PCs, and it seems to do a reasonable job of calibrating color.  It took some fiddling to get it working.  When it works, it's easy.  It's nice that it works on multiple monitors, which is why I picked it over the Spyder4Express.<br /><br />The software installed fine.  One PC, running Windows 7 Home Premium 64-bit with two monitors, would get an \\"error occurred\\" message after going through the full calibration process.  After trial and error, I found that it works if I run as administrator (start menu, right-click on ColorMunki Smile, click \\"Run as administrator\\").  The other PC worked fine right away, a Dell laptop with two external monitors running Windows 7 Professional 64-bit.<br /><br />The Smile is supposed to lie flat against the monitor but doesn't do so by itself on my monitors.  I lean a piece of wood against the Smile to press it toward the monitor and make it lie flat and still.<br /><br />One of my monitors is rotated to a \\"portrait\\" orientation (1600x1200 pixels).  The ColorMunki software was not designed for this; the start and before/after comparison buttons partially or completely disappear.  It does calibrate though, when I click around where the buttons should be; they just seem to be hidden.<br /><br />The process takes about 6 minutes per monitor.<br /><br />Note that the ColorMunki Smile does not help adjust brightness (luminance), which is significant for photo viewing; the more expensive ColorMunki models do this.  I use a DSLR to do a rough job of this per an article called \\"Using Your Camera To Check Monitor Luminance And Print Viewing Light\\".
B00B4FU6KE|5.0|This is an extraordinarily sympathetic book about the cruel and unsympathetic treatment of animals by their human brethren. Told in the confused voice of a chimp's human sister, it's honestly fragmentary as a record of events and consciously self-regarding in a good way. The absence of innocents in the narrative adds to the authenticity of the book, as does the periodic reference to real behavioral experiments connecting chimps with humans. For all our Godlike ambitions, the book seems to say, humans could use a much bigger dose of respect for their earthly cohabitants; and much deeper appreciation of the limits to our understanding of those we claim to love.
B009A882D0|5.0|Finally a CD with &#34;Keep On Chooglin'&#34; and &#34;Born On The Bayou&#34; on the same CD.  Hard to find songs that are, IMO, some of their best.
B005EHQGTS|1.0|Don't waste your money on this app, doesn't work properly.<br />Besides you need to have the amazon appstore installed AND you need to be logged in in the appstore to be able to start and use this app.<br />God knows what amazon is doing when you are logged in.
B0086221SS|1.0|It was one of the worst movies I've seen except for another movie I saw that Brad Pitt was in that I can't remember the name.  I watched the whole movie hoping it would get better, and you know what?  It didn't.  I like both the actors in it.  Maybe I'm missing something.  Weird!
B00DC7NNAC|2.0|This was neither a childrens story nor an adult tale. It wandered around, never really found a groove.<br />The concept and the entrance into OZ showed great promise. Unfortunately it never came together into a compelling story. In the end it was boring.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|We anxiously await each new episode of Downton Abbey throughout its short winter season.  Having it available on Amazon allows us our own summer rerun season at our house.
B0069G5Z9K|5.0|It's a very simple game but it's really fun.  My 4 year old kids love to play it too.  Definitely one of the better games out there that you can download for free.
6305128952|5.0|The only tape I had of this was a VHS taped from a t.v. showing. How was I to know that they had cut out nearly half of it or so it seems now that I've seen the whole thing. It differs from the book a little but only in very small ways.  Robert Redford and Kristen Scott Thomas are perfectly cast.  It's hard to believe that such a beautiful woman gave birth to such an ugly daughter but there she is.  Good acting job though.  All of the cast is wonderful. It is beautifully filmed, the country is beautiful, the horses are gorgeous. Who could ask for anything more.  It could have been a bit shorter but I guess that would have disturbed the lovely pace of the film. I'm sure I'll look at it many times.
B006LSZECO|2.0|To read a book that is supposed to be based on a diary and then almost at the end finding out that the so called diary is all made up???
B001AQO3QA|5.0|I am always replacing my videos and now they are all new in Blu-ray.  A great price too!  The Aliens are at home in my collection once again.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I can't wait for more levels. Fun and addictive. It's not too hard but does require a bit of thought. Fantastic game in all.
031603441X|4.0|Great read and interesting insight into one of rock's greatest guitarist songwriters. Chronologically tracks the band's rise from its earliest days to one of the greatest ever.
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Jack Ryan Junior finds himself in the black ops, but is astute enough to notice a super computer sleuth capable of major world disorder.  A great story that is timely, believable, detailed yet familiar with beloved characters awash in dan gerous activities.  You'll love it.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We started watching Suits because we were bored on a lazy weekend and now my family is addicted!  Harvey Specter is the man and Mike Ross gives the show just enough drama and suspense to keep you coming back for more.
B0074VTHKM|4.0|Grisham takes us into the mind of a young man who is discovering the right and wrongs of life in a southern town as he explores the realities of bad people and a future in the practice of law.
B0063M22QO|5.0|This game is not only fun but relaxing and addictive. I didn't want to put my Kindle down. I will recommend this game to family and friends.
B000SGGUWS|3.0|Pretty Little Liars was well written and believable, but tread a worn path of ruthless teen feminine brats, and thier path of discovery and self appreciation.
B007AYKZBI|5.0|This is a great CD full of wonderful music. I was able to purchase it at a great price and it was in great condition for such a low price.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|I had zero expectations about this movie, and although I found it somewhat graphically challenging with my 6 year old son, the movie and plot line were excellent! if you have small children and you expect this to be a nursery book, it's anything but that.
0618918248|5.0|I am really enjoying this book! It is very informative and very funny. I like that it gives me the facts and lets me make my own decisions as opposed to the religious side of the table where the message is &#34;Here is what happened and you must believe it to the letter as we tell you.&#34;. Great book.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|it says in the description that it requires so instead of complaining and saying you took Tim to wait for ot to download Read.
B007MDB548|5.0|My 4 1/2 year old loves this movie.. especially in 3D... it's pretty amazing.  Clean humor. No scary characters.  It's the typical cute Disney movie!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was a very interesting game!! it makes u think outside of the box.  it also makes me feel like a genius. also tht i wud be a good FBI
B008P3SPVU|5.0|This movie exposes more troubles than your traditional high school basketball drama. The sport can be replaced with \\"life\\" itself in a low poverty black and/or latino urban neighborhood. It is a movie about hope in a harsh reality that is very real to many and where many others are completely ignorant to or could care less. This is an inspiring film in which one can learn and take something from the characters' stories.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|very enertaining recommend ereryone watch it . plot and characters real and belavible cant wait until the next episode.I will watch it
1616550414|5.0|Unlike most textbooks, this one has a lot of pictures! I mean a lot. There's plenty of concept art, timeline information, manga in here, that it will take forever to see/read through it all.  But for Zelda, it's worth it.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Although Hosseini writes about Afghanistan each of his books is different. In his last book Hosseini weaves an intricate story that spans over three continents and with a big heartache comes to an optimistic end.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I do not care at all for the new format. Where is the hour by hour temps???  The old format was easy to read and navigate...this new one is not...I have started using another weather app because this is so hard to use!!
0792163710|5.0|We have this on VHS and wanted it on DVD  it is a classic that everyone should have and watch alot of meaning in this movie!
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|We just can't get enough of the walking dead series.  My husband & I watch it over & over.  We are on pins & needles for new season 4 coming out & we are on a waiting list for season 3.  Zombies who knew?!  right?!
B00008OWZC|3.0|This disc has some great concert recordings. Of that there is no doubt. The sound quality is the thing that really bothers me. Its very muddy. I wish they would do a good remaster and see if they could clean it up a little. I am, admittedly, a critical listener though, and many people may be very happy with this disc. It will remain in my collection regardless of the sound quality. Still a must have for big Zeppelin fans. I you are considering this as your first Led Zeppelin disc, however, buy one of the studio recordings instead. You'll be much happier.

B0002HWJY6|3.0|We own a lot of Schleich products and the Smurf line has been our least favorite so far. I bought the huts and a few of the characters for my kids to play with but it is really annoying to try to put the top back on the hut. It is challenging and frustrating even for adults.
1623420148|5.0|This was a really good book. I loved how it was wrote. It kind of reminded me over Beautiful Bastard in a way.
B009ZQJ1G4|4.0|Some stories just never get outdated. Equilibrium brings to mind 1984 and lots of other Big Brother type movies. It is well constructed, has some incredible martial arts scenes, and the ending is satisfying.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|I got this game as soon as I saw it came out on the Kindle. My aunt had a Samsung galaxy and got the game before me, and she'd let me play. I really enjoyed playing it on her phone, so when it came out on the Kindle, I had to get it.<br />The graphics are outstanding, and the background music is nice.<br />My advice: 1) Get a lot of Fan coral, the yellow plants that give you seadollars, and fruit loop coral. 2) Feed your rare fish a lot if you can. 3)play with lots of friends [add me: phoebelinasreef] so you can get rewards by visiting.<br />Also, I've only been playing for a few months, and I'm level 15.<br />I play on the Kindle Fire HD.<br />Hope this helped!
B00DQR26EC|5.0|best rpg that i have found in the chrono trigger/final fantasy style. great job HeartBit. if you like old school rpg's this is a must have.
B003JVH7XU|5.0|its great action movie, and i like specially scott adkins, geart story line and wonderful action at all. thats looks like a real action movie
B006VFLIYK|4.0|Score again for Baldacci. He continues to crank out excellent reads. I highly reccomend this book if you like fast paced action reads.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|It is a great game and sometimes it supports all of the world and sometimes it is a good time to get the best possible park with the world and sometimes it is a good thing about this is the world and sometimes it is a good thing about this is a good thing about this page book mark<br /> our homepage and i know how much of a great game.
B00C1N9JWO|5.0|Heart of Obsidian is one of the best in the Psy-Changeling series, and that is saying something. The romance is beautiful, and the culmination of several plot lines is fantastic to read after much waiting. I particularly adore how Nalini is able to keep Kaleb true to who he is- still restrained, still controlled, and yet make his relationship with *spoiler* Sahara believable and wonderful.
1583334386|4.0|The author explains at the outset that this book was organized to correspond to a 10-week class on Willpower she taught at Stanford. The book is so full of substantial ideas that it is best consumed at a rate of one chapter a week, just as if in a class. Expect to come away armed with some lenses through which you will see with sometimes painful clarity, all the things we do to sabotage ourselves, and all the things marketeers do to bolster them. Thankfully, though, the book provides not just these lenses but also some great strategies for finding more strength.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I gave it one star because there was no option for 0 stars. This movie should never have been made. Being able to understand the low volume dialog  would not even improve it.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I like that if you're patient you don't need yo spend cash to get expansions and that unlike other teamlavs games your dragon food doesn't expire. the graphics and sound is very cute. my storm8 id is djdoomgirl add Md when you download.
B00B69UQJY|4.0|It took me about seven times before I could get into Delta Machine. It has its moments, but not my favorite DM album. (Violator is my fav. Of the more recent albums, Playing the Angel and Sounds of the Universe were stronger.)
B0090XLDKY|5.0|If you like old musicals, you will love this one!n it is indeed a true American classic of a bygone era.
B002G1YPH0|4.0|Awesome looking<br />Quiet<br />Heavy - make sure to use backplate<br />Bit difficult to install from within some computer cases.<br />Super tall touches side of my budget case<br /><br />I my computer is in a room with just window air with humid weather in Missouri and have cpu overclocked to 4ghz and stays at 70c under 100% load<br /><br />120mm fan that is replaceable and can add fan to other side as well<br /><br />Would buy again
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|I love playing this game when I'm watching tv.  It keeps you thinking.  I think a lot of people will enjoy this game.
B004H1V5RU|3.0|Bought this for 12yr old son thinking he would love it - which he did for a short while - but is quite difficult with and w/o a steady hand - nobody in family has made it to the end of any of the tracks still.
B0049J3QAY|5.0|There's nothing I even need to say about this movie.  This is just another beautifully made film by Pixar and Monsters, Inc. is no exception.  They manage to appeal to kids, yet make it thoroughly enjoyable for adults alike.<br /><br />Don't even think about it... just watch it.  Awesome film.
B002QEXNDE|5.0|Norah has an amazing voice but I like this album especially.  I heard an interview with her about it where she discussed some of the themes and that really tied the Album together well, so much so that even though I owned the CD when it first came out, I didn't hesitate to pickup a vinyl copy when I saw it on Amazon.  There's something about the touch, feel and sound of vinyl that really gives your favorite albums a memorable quality.<br /><br />&#34;Man of the hour&#34; is my favorite, pick up a copy and figure out yours!
B008SAZHLQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this book - I guess I'm the perfect age-it took me back to first love. The only thing that would have made it even better to me was more music references. I felt like she held back a little on that. But the two characters are so charming and it's just heartwarming how they find eachother.
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Cute graphics, simple but still slightly challenging parts. Still need to figure out how to get all the gems in each level.
B00992CF6W|4.0|I put this on my tablet for the kids and ended up on all my devices. The app is great and encourages teamwork and spacial rendering.  This app will kill your battery so beware when you lone your device as it might come back dead.  What I found is the faster your device processor, the faster the battery use.
B000SP1SEO|5.0|I was very skeptical about seeing this movie, especially since Benicio Del Toro gets top billing on the Amazon website (he is not a favorite). However, he plays a minor, and quite funny role, so bonus. What people need to know is that the movie, though raw and brutal in places, is outstanding. It is funny, dramatic, and offers several tongue-in-cheek segments that add to the overall greatness of the movie. Jason Statham, Brad Pitt, Dennis Farina, Andy Beckwith, Vinnie Jones, Rade Serbedzija, Lennie Jones, and Alan Ford (as the pure evil Bricktop) are each excellent in their roles. I recommend this movie to everyone I know (adults only of course). Even if you don't enjoy the British-style of humor, the last twenty minutes of the movie will blow you away!
3836538725|5.0|One of the most important books of the century.<br />This book will last for 500 years not unlike Michelangelo's David.
B00C061HZY|5.0|Great Sound with my new Audio Technica AT-LP120USB turnable. I recommend this fabulous vinyl. Get lucky is the best songs of this year.
0142419400|5.0|I'm super embarrassed to admit that Anna and the French Kiss has been sitting on my bookshelf for close to three years. I'm not really sure why I didn't pick it up prior to this month. I mean, I had heard nothing but AMAZING things about it. Plus it was something I had been dying to read. Anyhow, I'm so glad I finally gave it a chance, because Anna and the French Kiss was everything I had hoped it to be and much, much more! It was romantic. It was funny. It had so many \\"AWWWW!\\" moments that I lost count. Basically, this book was the definition of a great, romantic contemporary book!<br /><br />One of the aspects I loved the most about Anna and the French Kiss was the characters. I adored Anna from the start. She was funny and smart. Plus I just loved her take on life and people. The part that I loved most about her, though, was how easily I could relate to her. I understood the pain that could come from wanting the one person you couldn't have as well as how easy it is to forgive and move on at times. Moving on, I LOVED St. Clair. I had heard from other people that he is a pretty memorable YA boy, and they were completely right. Every time he entered a scene he always managed to steal the show with his wit and overall St. Clair-ness. And as much as I wanted to rip him a new one at times for certain things, it didn't detract from me liking him one bit. I also enjoyed the variety of side characters introduced. From Anna's Nicholas Sparks like dad, to her Paris friends, to her friends and family all the way back home, each and every one brought something special to the table.<br /><br />The plot in this was also a ton of fun! Paris was such a fabulous setting, and it's one I really wish we saw more of in YA. I loved how Stephanie managed to intertwine little tidbits and descriptions in about it, as it really managed to make me feel like I was right there with Anna the whole time. However, it also makes me want to travel there even more now! I also enjoyed seeing Anna transition into Paris living. It wasn't the easiest of transitions, and I loved how Perkins made it that way. Plus it was just great to see Anna evolve as a character because of it. Lastly, the ROMANCE. There's not much to say besides the fact that I ADORED it! There was so much tension and \\"WILL THEY OR WON'T THEY?!\\" moments I always enjoy, so I was pretty darn happy about it all.<br /><br />In all, Anna and the French Kiss is a new favorite YA contemp of mine, and if for some reason you haven't read it yet, go out and read it ASAP. Seriously, you don't want to wait another second.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B009XIXVU6|2.0|Times kept changing and the characters were hard to keep track of.  Some characters even had the same name and it was hard to adjust to who I was reading about.  Also too many characters.  Book did not meet my expectations and lacked focus.
0142422010|5.0|After reading the adorable and super sweet Anna and the French Kiss, I immediately started Lola and the Boy Next Door, the companion to Anna. I was a little worried it wouldn't be as good as Stephanie's first book; however, by the first chapter, I knew that wouldn't be the case at all, as Lola and the Boy Next Door was just as amazing, if not a little more so!<br /><br />There were so many fantastic things going for this book; however, one of my favorites was the setting. Just like Paris, San Francisco is high on my list of places to travel, so the fact that Lola was set there made everything so much better. I loved Perkins' descriptions of the city, and I loved seeing her intertwine little parts of its history and charm within the text.<br /><br />Another aspect I loved was the characters. Lola was someone who I'd want to be best friends with if she was real. I loved her spunk and attitude as well as her love of costumes and extraordinary outfits. She was such a kick ass character, so seeing everything from from her POV made this book great, in my opinion. I also loved the addition of Cricket, Lola's love interest. He was totally different from St. Clair; however, that made me love him all the more. I loved how wickedly smart he was as well as his love for inventions. Plus his love for Lola was seriously adorable, even though he made some major screw-ups at times regarding it. I also enjoyed seeing characters from Anna and the French Kiss pop up in this one as well! It was awesome getting to see them from anther character's perspective as well as to see how they played a role in this book.<br /><br />The plot in this was also a lot of fun! I loved the development of Lola and Cricket's sorta-forbidden love as well as all the sweet and memorable scenes that popped up because of it. Furthermore, I enjoyed seeing more about Lola's love of costumes. Her outfits always sounded legendary, even though they probably would have been way too wild for me. I also loved the family aspect in this one. It was awesome to see that Lola had two dads, as that doesn't appear too much in YA. Plus I adored how Stephanie presented them just as any other family would be: loving, protective, and with their own fair amount of problems.<br /><br />In all, Lola and the Boy Next Door was another great one by Perkins! I seriously can't wait to see how everything comes together in Isla and the Happily Ever After.<br /><br />Grade: A+
B005K17RU0|3.0|Nice app.  I would have given 5 stars if the maps were enlargable or zoomed.  Lots of nice information and easy to use.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This was the best game for horse lover's and none horse lover's you should give this game a try I had a lot of fun with it.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The new app has less info than the old one.  I changed to a different app and deleted this one.  Shame it used to be a good one ... now ... not so much.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|This is such a great game both I and my son can play it! Also you aren't forced to spend money only if you want special options all the levels are free! This is a keeper
B000FBFMZ2|5.0|Very good writing for Sci-fi. Couldn't put it down. Makes you wonder if this is where humans are headed  Alive with great action and suspense.
B000JCQCW4|4.0|Ellen Burstyn's performance was excellent in this story of drug use and its' affect on the lives of a mother her son and his girlfriend.
B008220DIC|1.0|I gave this a second viewing.  Then another half.  Yeah... admittedly, on P.T. Anderson's past merit.  As much as I thoroughly enjoy P.T. Anderson this one is an immense serving of dull and hackneyed.  For the most part P.T. Anderson writes & directs superb and interesting films.  However, \\"The Master\\" is a waste of effort all around (as most everyone by now has caught on) due to what appears as desperation to be something it's not.  Maybe that is the \\"point\\" that P.T. strove to incorporate in the context.  If that is the case, then his laziness and superficiality bled through a bit too obviously and set it apart from the \\"point\\".  Nonetheless, I still wonder if this could have been much better, and sometimes I'd wondered if the editing fails it.  On a side note: the acting is superb, and by that I mean Joaquin Phoenix seems the only one who did his work.  Yet, after my last viewing it began to appear that the film is wholely made up of P.T's melodramatic intrusion which seems to translate, to me, that everyone except him came to realize by day one that this thing, ultimately, presumes way too much.  Or, that it *is*, actually, just dumb.
B0060D2WYI|5.0|Great movie. Special effects look a little silly, but it is an older movie. My kids loved it. Thank you.
B0076DCT2G|4.0|Lots of twists and turns in the story. I like Detective Corey's sarcasm and wit. The adventure is well written.
159463176X|4.0|I love Khaled Hosseini's style, and this is a new structure so he can include different stories in the book. Yes, it might be distracting to jump from one country to another, but I find it interesting. If it does not have the ending everybody expected, well..., life is not always a happy-ever-after all the time anyways. I do resent the other customers that are not open minded enough to review this book based only on its special features and keep trying to compare it to the previous two books this amazing writer gave us. A writer has the right to explore with his talent and the pleasure that words can provide to both, the author and the reader.
1594203334|5.0|As a parent, grandparent and a former student of early childhood education, I learned some new ways of teaching little ones and just enjoyed reading about Ms. Druckerman's experiences. I thought the book was very well written although a little repetitive in the last chapter or so.
B0061QD88S|5.0|My granddaughter likes to watch this dvd before bedtime.  Even her 15month old brother will stop and<br />watch it also.  Must be the talking dogs :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|A really fun game to play!!!! Just like real horses!! Love it!!!really worth the download!! Sure to please! Lots of fun<br />,
B00127RAJY|5.0|I have been working out for a few years doing mostly cardio. I love the time frame and the slight challenge of this workout. It is just what I needed to start my road to strength training.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|An original story with original phrases used to establish a world unfamiliar to most of us. Thank you for the visit.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|I like the multiple alarms and the repeat function. I work three days 7 _ 4 and two days I have to be in at 5 - 2 it is nice to have these programmed in so I don't have to thing bout it
B001NHNG64|5.0|BRILLIANT!  Love the Jack Reacher series. Die Trying was fast paced with  an interesting story and compelling characters. Couldn't put it down!  I have read 9 Reacher books so far. Each book in the series is in a different setting with new characters and cities to explore so the stories do not become repetitious. Can't wait to start book 10 !
B00914JWSW|5.0|Everything that comes from Barbra is wonderful!  Love listening to her in my car-relieves stress and makes me enough my commute. Enough  said.
B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Love it! I would recommend this edition to anyone who is a life long Black Sabbath fan or Ozzie fan.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|I tried several of the experiments and they worked. The one about weight loss didn't work because I didn't believe it would. It's as simple as that! The book is an easy read but read it one experiment at a time. It makes more sense if you do. The proof is in the pudding!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I caught part of an episode while channel surfing one day, and was intrigued but I hate not watching a series from the beginning. I was aware of the awards it had won, and when it showed up on Netflix, my daughter and I started watching. And couldn't stop. Didn't realize Season 3 was half over, and to late to DVR, so I got Amazon prime just to catch up. Love the characters, the story, the dialogue, the costumes: everything. Only complaint is having to wait so long for  kre!
B000005H7D|5.0|This CD had the highest rating of all of Coltrane's CDs, and now I know why.  It's very relaxing music but upbeat.  I can listen to it while working on the computer etc., and still focus on my work, yet I won't get drowsy like I do with classical or new age music. It's a great introduction to Coltrane and probably his best work.
B00821OX98|5.0|You won't find yourself rolling your eyes on this one: It's refreshing to finally have a show that not only improves on the mediocre acting/directing/writing -- such as what you find in _any_ show on SyFy channel, these days -- but that actually goes above and beyond to bring its audience true, quality science fiction, the likes of which I haven't seen on television in at least six years.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|This is a well made classic story that takes us not only back to the history and but also to the complexity of human behavioral and emotional world that we can all relate to. It is a moist see.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|This is an inspiring story that most people can relate to in their own lives. I look forward forward to reading the other books by this author.
B00DHKKN6Q|5.0|I luv it. It is a fun game 2 play, try it and u will be hooked. It is very addicting.  :)
B00D37UQ1K|4.0|the movie portrayed the setting of the movie very well.  The cave was exactly how I imaged it when I read the book years ago.  Things had to be condensed and you don't get to see as much of the characters development as in the novel, but this is to be expected for any movie adaptation of a book.  Take it at face value and just enjoy the movie as it is... If you want more, then just re-read the book.
B005ZOBNOI|1.0|I tried reading this book, and I found it boring. I feel bad saying that because the story line could have been a lot better. I ordered it because of the rave reviews.....sorry I just don't get all the 4 and 5 stars.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|The novel features an original world, seen through the eyes of the hero, in a coming-to-age storyline. Very fluid and immersive read, with enough left unanswered / unfinished to give room to a sequel.
0205313426|4.0|FROM THE STANDPOINT OF A VALUE PURCHASE, THE BOOK IS<br />QUITE STANDARD ADVICE, EASY TO ACCESS, USEFUL BUT LIMITED IN SCOPE.
B00908DDZM|5.0|If you like rap and/or hip hop, then you need to own this CD. There are song with quick beats and even some slower ones. All are highly enjoyable. Listen to the lyrics; Macklemore is very talented and witty.
B0064J6OMO|4.0|This movie was actually not bad. It had me laughing at many parts. I would definitely be renting this again.
B0091REZMW|4.0|I love this game. been playing for 3 days and can hardly put down my kindle fire.  Love the many rooms and the outside too.  only bad thing is there is not enough diamonds rewarded to keep playing like I would like to and I refuse to play real money to play fictitious games.
1451695195|5.0|For me this book is Truth loving gathered, distilled and encoded so that we may remember what we are and where we come from. If you read this book, your life will never be the same. The illusion of separation, of the permanence of death, of a chasm between science and spirituality will likely fade away or at least be contextualized. When we can hold duality in unity consciousness, as this book suggests and offers as a possibility, we will find true peace and freedom here on earth. Thank you Dr. Alexander for manifesting such a miraculous illness and recovery so that you could be the messenger of this Divine gift.
B009KS4XRO|1.0|service by bingo blitz leaves a lot to be desired. I was told that joining the elite group for 14.99 per month would give me early access to to new rooms and other extras. this has not happened and it seems the service is worse every week.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Every update gets better. Love being able to now share pins with friends. So many great ideas I've used from Pinterest!
B00514HDNW|3.0|Book progresses slowly and nothing exciting ever happens until the end, and it is anti-climactic and leaves you feeling disappointed at the end, especially if you are a fan of the movie.
B00005MP58|5.0|Definitely the best version of the book that translated to film.  It is very raw, very much like how people in society behave
B00CWY76CC|5.0|i love these kinds of games, it made you think and it tested your memory. it was the next level up from 100 floors, wish it was longer though.
0800141660|5.0|Great movie.  Superb acting.  Excellent story with bits of humor.  The movie keeps you on your toes with all of the twists and turns of relationships.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|A great distraction when I need to take a break from work. Great for people who like problem solving games.
B000YIGNKE|5.0|This is a great movie the two main characters are strong and by the end, you are on the edge of your seat waiting for the climax.
B009NQZVKG|5.0|I have enjoyed many of his Sigma Force novels. How he can keep up the pace year after year I can't imagine. It's a thrilling ride right on the edge of what is known about the universe.<br />I can't wait to see what he pulls out of his hat next.
B00BXKKNFS|4.0|While it has some quirks on the Kindle (probably) due to the Fire HD's control-freak DRM and interface, Adblock does the same thing here as it does for your browser. I haven't noticed the speed issues that other users report. Also, I haven't found any apps that improve my life enough to download them, so I can't confirm whether it blocks those ads too. The biggest issue I have is the frequent notices of new updates. In themselves they're no problem, but the Kindle doesn't like to let it update without various warning screens and other annoyances.
B005LAJ23A|5.0|Best TV drama/action/suspense genre ever created!! It blends all the necessary elements to make it an instant classic for years to come! I hope the show goes on for the next decade!
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|The wonderful cast is back with new twists....especially the ending!!!  Such rich depth of character development and wonderful writing make this one of my all time favorite series ever.  Especially recommend it to any other &#34;all things England&#34; suckers who can't get enough of their accents and cultural mannerisms.  You won't be disappointed but may be startled.
0446691437|5.0|It's such a powerful book, that I refuse to lend it.  But I have made many of my friends buy it.  For me it has been the turning point to understanding what kept me from realising my dreams and making the conscious decision to &#34;Go Pro!&#34;.
0440243688|5.0|Like all the Lee Child novels; gripping, compelling, entertaining, and a must read. You just cant read one. You'll enjoy this one.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I always wanted to play this game. but it keeps freezing and it makes my tablet not work. can you please fix that.
B00BHNQ5XK|5.0|I love watching scary movies and this one is special. This movie is one of those movies where it will put disturbing images in your brain. This movie is great if your into spooky scary movies.
B0046B3QTG|5.0|I look forward to Despicable Me 2!  The kids laughed and enjoyed the film as well as received a great message about caring for one another.
B00AA2I2NK|5.0|I love all his music. I recommend that you listen to some of his work before purchasing to check if it is your type of music. It is easy listening type music, at times creates emotions and sounds classical. His music is classic and if you are into this type of music then you would love his albums. You could listen to some of his work on youtube then if you like it, purchase it! Support these artists that make classics. A real musician and a great pianist. Great music while doing light work, emailing, reading, writing, relaxing or even meditating. Great for retail stores, supermarkets, hospitals, funeral homes, lounges, coffee shops, law offices, real estate offices, insurance offices, etc.. With all the stress we endure these days we definitely need some more relaxing and classical music.
B00BNGFGIQ|5.0|Love the game...tons of fun...no problems. works good on kindle fire<br />I highly recommend this one.you will not be disappointed.
B00AEFXOWC|5.0|I don't know about actors, directors and such but it is a good action movie. Not a lot of flashey closeups ect. Just good acting and story.
B009I2UH2W|1.0|I'm pretty disappointed in this product. I'm not sure if I received a defective cord, but it sure didn't last long. One day of use and the lightning connector literally broke off in my phone. Fortunately I was able to get it out of my phone. But it still is a disappointment. On the good side, Amazon refunded my purchase and sent a link with instructions to return the item, shipping on them. So, I appreciate the good customer service, even if I did get a bad product.
B000O8OTNC|3.0|pros<br />the diamond tampered rod is great<br />sharpens well<br />compact<br />inexpensive<br /><br />cons<br />only the rod really sharpens<br /><br />if you get a nice knife dont use the ceramic or carbide sharpeners on this, it will only dull your blade
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|A fun game in the tradition of Myst. Kind of short, but challenging enough I couldn't put it down until I finished it! More please!
B004KPQK2S|5.0|One of the most well done movies I have seen in a long time. I enjoyed it and will watch again.
B0095P31L6|4.0|This movie was very enjoyable. This is a story about choosing your own path and making a name for yourself, no matter where you came from. The voice talent did an excellent job delivering a a sweet and humorous story. Good movie for us kids of all ages.
B006PAZMMK|1.0|I Just wanted the track called summit, but I got the whole album on accident. Summit is okay, but the album isn't  for me.
B003FXXNH6|4.0|I owe all three Undisputed films so I was afraid they may have made one to many. But my wife is big on completing sets, so since we have 1 & 2, I had to get #3. I enjoyed the story line of this one and the ending was a great surprise.
B0083EY9EI|5.0|... For a reason ... Really great music.  Lyrics to die for ... a delivery that rocks ... The sultry voice of heaven whispering powerful words in your ears that only make you want more ... I am a fan!
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Don't get me wrong. I loved the book, but how some scenarios happened left me somewhat upset. But I suppose if you take on the scenarios as each of the characters, then how they responded was suitable. So I would say go into the book not as an outside reader, but actually putting yourself in their shoes for each step along the way to a surprising chapter to the trilogy.
B00902AKK4|5.0|JUST GOT THIS AND ALREADY  ARGUMENTS  WHO'S GONNA PLAYFIRST!  LOOKS  LIKE A THINKINKING GAME Q UITE GOOD  GRAPHICS. (SOMETHING  DIFFERENT)ENJOY LKE WE HOPE TO (what video clip of game  it will show you what it's about before buying)
B000LTAY1U|5.0|Seiko clock beautiful, practical and suitable for military personnel who are looking for a wristwatch bear Kther of hardships Balazafah the to it with a distinctive shape and beautiful. As you Albzaah and arrived in record time and in excellent condition and there is no any problems<br />Thank you very much
B001POX73C|5.0|I enjoy reading Georgette Heyer's stories, especially the Regency stories. How convenient to have them on the Kindle! Thank you!
B00BOUL9DM|2.0|its the same as the other one . you cant move forward youhave to find the word im on a word that i cant figure out and others cant . i would love to move on . even if i lost points  not being able to play is no fun . i would not recomend this game
B00124DQZO|4.0|Just thought people might like to know that for reasons that are inexplicable, the mp3 files on sale for this album at Amazon all have a 1 second silent gap at the end of each song. This is especially maddening when listening to \\"Ballet for a Girl in Buchanon\\" (Make Me Smile, Color My World etc) which is spread over 7 mp3 files. That is one piece where the gaps really mess up the flow. Amazon, if you're reading this, I would urge you to RIP this one over again. I checked these files in Pro Tools, and it's true that the gap is present in each file and cannot be removed, even if ripped to a CD.<br /><br />The concert itself is very good. I notice a lot of people saying it has higher sound quality than the Carnegie Hall concert. This is debatable now, since they did such a great job with the remastering of that show.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|It's cool didn't expect nun less from it best experience ever and easy to use no problems yes yes yes
B007PE98CK|5.0|As a tarot card reader, I personally prefer the Universal Waite to the Rider-Waite. The coloring is bright and beautiful, without being garish as the \\"Radiant\\" Rider-Waite deck strikes me. For my tarot readings, I offer my clients a choice of decks, and this is always one of them. For tarot novices, this is the deck to learn from.
B001EN71CW|1.0|The first disk gets you interested, but starts to develop problems with playback in the last episodes.  The second and third disk won't play on any of my DVD players.  They look fine, but I think these guys were so concerned with copy protection that what they ended up with a set of DVDs that is basically unusable and a complete waste of your money.  Plus, by the time you realize that you were scammed, it's too late to return them.
B007FEFLTO|4.0|Excellent follow-on to Fall of Giants.  Family saga woven into historical events.  This is an extremely readable novel that provides many diverse perspectives on the World War II Era.  The characters are multi-dimensional and realistically drawn.  Ken Follett has become one of my favorite authors.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I wish I would have viewed this prior to Downton Abbey, if I would have done so, I would have raved about it.  I really shouldn't compare the two, but now it's hard not to.  Filmed in the 70's and much of it in black & white, it is very well done.  Different, yet very much the same as Downton Abbey with many of the same issues, yet not as soap opera-ish.  Can't wait to view Season 2.
B007O4XX9K|5.0|One of the best albums I have purchased in a long time. Musically and lyrically I loved it! He is timeless and sounds better than ever!  Would love to see him in concert, am going when he plays with the Eagles but he needs to also start out on his own again! Excellent and you will be glad you bought it!
B00785P2QC|1.0|Just not for me and I want a game that will keep my attention span I wasn't pleased and no thank u
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I was immensely drawn to the character of Lavinia, the white orphan who grows up with slaves on the plantation in late 18th century Virginia. The story switches between her narrative and that of Belle, her surrogate mother. The plot moves very quickly, and I had a hard time putting it down. The ending was kind of predictable, although not all of the loose ends were wrapped up. This is a thought provoking book about the lives of enslaved people and the injustices they endured.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Most games like this the objects are in the same place making it boring after a while.  Not this one I love it.  The only thing I don't care much for is I run out of money and you don't get to play it as long as I would like.
B004UID2LC|5.0|other people are saying that it doesn't run the music they download, but I have had this app to a long time and it runs great! I have downloaded like 50 songs and 12 videos, and it is perfect in the car.. and I'm in the car a lot! I would recommend it to everyone, and it is free. no adisional charges!
B001AFF25W|4.0|Helps you get to the root of what is needed to succeed. Tracy has great insights and puts them in a way that is easy to understand.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|this came is so awaone that I cane atop plying ir ia is so dun ans unpredictable at the same romw
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is fun for people who like mysterious situations and like to put there mind to the test a must play!!!
B008NMT684|5.0|My 23 month old son loves this app. He loves puzzles and this is a perfect travel puzzle. He is able to easily navigate through the app on his own.
B00AEJM6H2|1.0|At first, I loved this game. Then, the more I played, noticed did not correctly keep score, or time limit correct. Fine if just playing for fun
B00632HWOG|5.0|This app works very well and I like how you can jump into and out of an email. I would recommend this to anyone.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|This is a great saga to watch when interruptions are nil.  The show moves at a pace that is just right - but move it does, and if the phone rings or someone enters the room to talk, hit the pause button! You will surely miss a key point in the show!  I Love the accents, the clothing, the mansion, the scenery, the dialog!  I hate... the end of the season!  I hate waiting for the next season to start! oH.. AND I HATE WHEN A MAJOR CHARACTER DIES!  Come back Downton Abbey... we miss you!
B00CDT41RY|4.0|I really liked this movie. It is something different but there are a couple drawbacks to it that prevented me from being thrilled with it.<br />1) The violence was excessive and over dramatized.<br />2) The language was a bit strong at times.<br />I liked all the main actors and it kept my interest through-out most of the movie.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I love Mahjong, and have played it for years.  On a smart phone most of the games leave a lot to be desired, but this one works very well and is very palyable on my droid x2.  Its a real hoot on a 7\\" tablet!  Good play and many levels to keep oneself amused!
B00BSBVLF8|5.0|Ok, I am a Cirque Du Soleil fan so anything they do I generally love (once in a while it's just a like). The talent is amazing and the dedication the artists must have in order to perform is inspiring. I really liked the fact that I could watch this at my leisure and not have to pay the usual ticket price for the experience. I hope they put more of their shows on DVD or Blue-ray so I can enjoy those as well.
B004I744AS|5.0|Well written. The app contains Current definitions.  It is very  easy to access and very easy to use.  I would recommend it.
B004KBSQOW|5.0|I gave this album to a friend for a long road trip  They liked it so much that at the end of the trip they could sing the songs in Hawaiian.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|Very insightful acting.  Some scenes were hard to watch but I felt there was good research behind these stories.  Can't wait to see the next season.
B005KPDAN4|5.0|This was a perfect ending to a great 8 season run of \\"House.\\" I started watching this show about 2 years ago and automatically fell in love with it. I am a RN and I get a kick out of Dr. Greg House because he actually reminds me of a couple of doctors that I know. Anytime the show is on I am watching it!! Love this show!!!
B004SEUIXS|5.0|This was a sweet little comedy with its own roaming gnome! Such a pretty view of a magical Paris. I would definitely recommend this.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is another fun room escape puzzle game that is cleverly designed.  I am often amazed at how complicated and thought-provoking the solutions are.  When I solve them I feel very satisfied.  I highly recommend this game to people who enjoy the genre.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Read this book again and I was as delighted as the first time I read it. It brought back good memories.
B009WUAK2M|1.0|This was so bad (I only watched about 10 minutes) that I almost wanted to give it more stars for its unintended comic value! Sylvester Stallone was so over-the-top he seemed like he was doing a parody of himself!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Loved this game,so fun, ! Challenging and mind blowing. It's a must play but can't put down kinda game! I wanna play again, !
B004LSJCJM|5.0|I had never heard of this artist but I'm glad I did now.  Bought this for my husband for Father's Day and will definitely buy more of his music.
B000FVE3BG|5.0|No complaints. Absolutely love it. Is the best watch I own and wouldn't trade it for anything. Love the yellow gold accent.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|A beautiful story about people's roots and lack thereof and how important both are in shaping us.  Told in several cities around the world but great insight into the people of Afganistan.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|it is very addicting. You should start playing today. The minions that you can buy you can pay with bananas or tokens.
B00B0X4PIO|2.0|Hasn't really grabbed my interest.  Started and couldn't get into it and have moved on to another book.  May come back to it  at some point!
B007ZXK08C|5.0|unbelievable story your kept guessing till the very end. amazing book would recommend to anyone. twists throughout and always trying to second guess whats going to happen. cant wait for the film. most definitely an adddictive read. 5 stars
B0095MVOMC|4.0|I liked it a lot, definitely I recommend to others. Kids will love this as the game is filled with colorful screens.
1589795474|3.0|This book got old about 40 pages in. I appreciate the information and effort the authors made in compiling the data, but it began to really drag on, making it tough to continue on reading.
B005DJGMQE|4.0|This film distinguishes itself by treating an interesting, under-exposed piece of American history with a high-quality screenplay and fine acting, particularly from Robin Wright.
B00422LESE|1.0|All the same old stuff. Except that he kills off philosophy, proclaims himself the emperor of divining ultimate truths and asserts that gravity created everything. Sad, very sad.
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Started watching the series on TV but never saw the first season.  Well worth the price.  Now I know how it all started.
B008YU0AOE|5.0|I use if with my Kindle Fire all the time.  I so love it.  Now that it has a full page view its GREAT!  Always at my fingertips anytime I need a calculator....I would highly recommend...
B000JMKQX0|3.0|The book was okay.  I don't know how they are going to make this a movie.  It did not tie together well and was extremely anti-climatic.  When I saw on my kindle that I was 93% of the way through the book I was shocked.  It hadn't really gone anywhere and I certainly did not feel that it had given me any clear closure.  There was absolutely no character development at all.  I could not describe one character to you including what I would call the journalist who is telling the story.
B004JZBGWI|5.0|I am always writing myself things to do and I love writing my daily notes on this....I would recommend it highly.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Watched season on TV but wasn't sure I had seen all of the episodes.  Now I am up to par.  Would recommend this to anyone that likes horror or science fiction.
B009C7JS14|4.0|so this is a good app but I feel like its missing something I cant quite put my finger on it though
B005K17RU0|5.0|This is a very reliable app that gives you the weather info you need to plan your day .Also the interface is simple to use .I highly recommend this app for reliable weather information.<br />  I plan to go to the pro version in the near future , but don't let that throw you the free version is an excellent app.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|From the very first page, the omniscient narrator DEATH, drew me into this beautifully written novel and would not let me go until the very end. This work of literary fiction, set in a little town outside Munich during Nazi Germany, gives the reader a glimpse of what day to day life was like for the German people as well as the Jews.I can't stress enough how unique this book is and how endearing the characters become. The Book Thief is classified as adolescent literature, but it is really a story for all ages. I can see, though, how the book could be used in a high school or college English class where students discuss and analyze characters, theme, symbols, irony, metaphors, and foreshadowing.
B004GYY714|5.0|Downloaded and went thru it and found it very useful.  Located all the stations playing my favorite type of music or talk, and set my favorites.  Very easy to use.
B00B8M4IMK|5.0|I had another dual USB port car charger, and it took quite a while for my Samsung Galaxy S3 to charge.  If I was using GPS while charging, then I'd actually LOSE about 1% battery life every 10 minutes.  With the Anker, my batter will ACTUALLY get charged while I'm using the GPS navigation on my phone.  Awesome!
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|If you like FreeCell, having this on your tablet will be very satisfying.  Just like the full PC versions and just as capable.
B004U8ZH8S|3.0|I really liked that it was in HD but... It was all around an awful movie. It wasn't very interesting... Don't buy this movie!
B003UBTX7C|4.0|I like espionage and stories of diversion.  This one keeps you guessing about who is the bad guy and the good guy.
B0063M22QO|4.0|Lots of fun.easy to navigate. Nice and challenging. Could have a few more bells and whistles but great for the price:)
B009XIXVU6|4.0|I was very excited that Khaled Hosseini had a new book out.  And I liked this book, but for me it was not on the same caliber as &#34;The Kite Runner&#34; or &#34;A Thousand Splendid Suns&#34;.  The small connections between the characters, leading to the telling of each character's story, made it feel more like a collection of related short stories than like a cohesive novel.  Again, he writes beautifully and it is well worth reading, but maybe just not in &#34;one of the best books I've ever read&#34; category.
B001NA6096|5.0|Must watch before &#34;Before Sunset.&#34; Great dialogue. We watched the movie again after watching the latest, &#34;Before Midnight.&#34; Worth the time.
B0026772N8|5.0|It's a very interesting and well-written book with many questions inside and many answers. Would be interesting to everyone who reflects about life and the place of personality in it, happiness, reason and other complicated things.
B001N9ESQ4|5.0|This is the sequel to Before Sunrise. Great to know what happened after they left each other at the train station. And if you want to know what happens after this movie ends, you've got to go see Before Midnight. The dialogue in each of the movies is so intelligent and authentic. Will watch again to catch details I missed the first and second times.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I plan on playing it again. I was glad to have the directions as I went along with the adventure. Try it.
B002RUA54W|3.0|Although the book is well written I thought it was a bit slow moving, and didn't actually warm to the protagonist, or ANY of the characters.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a very fun game! They did an amazing job on the graphics! I love the minions! I recommend this for ANY age. It's so good, I'll give it 6 stars!(:
B0089LOKHG|5.0|This whole series was amazing. It captivated me with such power I literally could not put this book down. I read this book in one day, that's how great it was. I highly recommend this series!!!
B009NY43NY|4.0|Seems like everyone either loves or hate the way Charlaine Harris ended her Sookie series...and I'm sure it's all a matter of personal preference.  I had my predictions, which didn't make me happy -- and Harris went in a different direction, so I was pleasantly surprised.  I feel satisfied with the way the story ended.
B00DHNJCKQ|4.0|I had never even heard of this movie when I decided to watch it, turns out it was better than most of the ones I was looking forward to seeing. The connection between the main characters is incredible and even gut wrenching at times as you feel their individual pain as deeply as you feel the solace they somehow find in each other. Superb acting, good soundtrack, drama, action, revenge, and even romance; whats not to like. The only thing I really saw as a negative was the character played by terrance howard, somehow his role fell flat for me, but not enough to take away from the overall story.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This app was the best app ever!!!!!!!!It is a mixture of temple run and subway surfers with Despicable Me stuff all mixed into one great,enjoyable game!!!!!!!!!!
B00BNGFGIQ|4.0|Don't expect too complicated of levels. But still fun. Fast pace and keep the eyes open looking for more gems. Great way to relax.
B005KJJ4F8|4.0|\\"Cinder\\" had me hooked since the first page. Every page reveals a new secret. It is hard not to fall in love with most of the characters. This is a must read!! I can't wait to read \\"Scarlet\\".
B000SEIDR0|5.0|An excellent book!  I would recommend its reading to everyone.  It creates consciousness.  A must now a days.  It gives all the information needed to take a stand in the &#34;green era&#34;.
B0093QJY0Y|5.0|Classic black and white that was so far ahead of its time. Not only innovative cinematography but the writing and acting still hold up today.
B00DHSK3RM|1.0|I read the title and I thought I knew what I was getting....help for levels....but there seems to be only certain levels with guides to them and my very many.  It's a little confusing and not very user friendly....it did not help me at all.
B003M6WERG|5.0|Honestly the greatest sitcom since Seinfeld. I can not stop watching. I would<br />Definitely recommend this show to anyone who has not seen it.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Would give it a perfect review if the minimum limit that you have to bet would not have been raised. Also there needs to be a limit on how many gifts you can send, people are not even trying to complete collections they just go room to room begging for what they need.
B005ERIRZE|5.0|I'm going to try to teach a modified version of this for my 4th, 5th and 6th graders.  Read this if you want to understand male behavior.
B008UCJ7KO|3.0|That ending kind of just pissed me off. Wtf!?! I've enjoyed the books however--- how long will we wait for this one???
B000A59PMO|5.0|I am so glad to have the first season.  I have the 2nd and 3rd that I have kept, but the first season's episodes didn't come thru as well.  I am very happy anytime I see the cast in other works, especially Kristin Bell.  I am happy to see that they are doing a movie.  The fan base for this series is wonderful.
B000FBFN1U|5.0|One of the best fantasy series!! I love the characters and the plot is so intense!! An epic fantasy that is one of the best reads out there!
B009VSW15Y|2.0|have not figured out how to share the pictures yet.  may actually have to look at the instructions.to get anything out of it
B004ZGI1V0|4.0|Neither my husband nor I typically like movies, but I saw snippets of this while running on the treadmill at the gym and thought it looked good.  We decided to rent it that night, and weren't disappointed.  It was suspenseful, intelligent, and had an interesting plot twist.  It held our attention for the entire movie, and was full of action.  I would see it again.
B00BXI26XC|4.0|it is interesting and shows the route and speed of the planes.  I fly a small plane and would find it intesting to see the planes without flight plans also.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This is one of the best triolgies ever. I could not put any of the books down. I'm actually reading them again now. Can't wait to see the Catching Fire movie this November.
B007Z58RLC|5.0|Learned so much from this book.  Well written, informative.  Have recommended it several times.  It's on my favorites list.  Enjoy!
B009XIXVU6|5.0|A beautiful illustration that human nature is global.  A great read, and a must for anyone that interacts with people.
B00335EQ0E|5.0|I was looking for Disney movies for my niece and purchased this. It was in great condition and she loves the movie of course
B004HWYTP4|4.0|The story line keep moving and was full of action and adventure, and humor scattered through the the movie to keep you on your toes!
B000OLGCI4|5.0|This is nro easily available new in the stores. I bought this for my niece . Very happy with the purchase. Was in great condition and arrived very quickly.  The movie of course is a classic, nothing more to say!!
B002AWJEU8|5.0|I enjoyed everything about it! It is so much better being able to see the all the songs on the DVD! Totally worth it!
B00594XOZU|5.0|I KNEW THEY HAD KIK U JUST HAVE TO SEARCH FOR IT BUT I FOUND IT!!!!!! :)  \(^-^)/ c: YAY
0440242401|4.0|I got this book from the used section and the book cover has marks that shows that people have USED it, which make sense :) however if one is particular about the outward appearance of the book (I was but now I'm not), you might not wanna get a folded cover right :)
B00CWY76CC|4.0|A fun game for timewasting. Nothing bad to say about it. Hope this is enough characters. Lalalalaaaaaa lalalalaaaaaa lala etc etc
006176759X|3.0|The book cover looks perfect (which means the book is in good shape, the previous owner had took a good care of it, so thank you ;) ) and that's exactly what I wanted, or rather, more than Ive expected.
B001DHXT6G|5.0|Of all the ST series, I still like TOS best. The remastering isn't over the top and imo breathes new life into this classic series. For around $100 ya can't beat it, most def a must own!
B003VANOFY|5.0|The headphones sound better than i had expected. The 7.1 surround sound is great very comfortable and microphone is clear and loud. I like the usb port charger that the headphones came with very good.
0425263924|2.0|Loved 1st 2 books & patiently waited for Entwined With You. Very disappointed! First 2 had action, good, believable characters along with great sex. Lots of emotional highs & lows in them. Entwined didn't have much of a story to it, lots of sex though. Kind of like watching a good movie, the 1st 2 in so-called trilogy were great but Entwined was like going from great R rated movie to porn. All sex, not much plot! If you keep the characters around, give them more of what you did in Bared & Reflected In You, some more realistic emotional highs & lows with something going on. This has a lot going on but most is between the sheets. Eva & Gideon deserve better!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My cousin bought this game for me on my kindle and I absolutely loved playing it! I got addicted to it, and so has my cousin. We sometimes even fight over my kindle who's gonna play on SubWay Surfers!
B000AQJPQE|3.0|Not for the older kids who are more advanced in the knowledge of our solar system more like a baby mobile.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love watching jeromeaf play mine craft but I could not get on the computer but once I found this app I could make a world of my own and I can even let my friends play creative or survival with me I would like to change my skin but I can't and I can play it on the go !
0307387178|5.0|What a story (true one at that) very compelling adventure about an ordinary college student with family disfunctions, gives up on the norm anf ships off to Alaska to live off the land (only he is not excactly prepared for the harsh Alaska wilderness long enough,.. Very sad ending. The video was also done very well.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I got this app with my free 500 coins so it was pretty much free, and I love it! First time I played minecraft and now I want the pc version to. one thing, I can never get on a realm server all ways full for me, I hope the next update will fix and maybe add more monsters, but aside from that it's great! Even has secrets like pigman portal :)
B0002S947K|5.0|Great songs. Great recording and mixing in the studio. Not a bad song on the CD. I've been listening to it constantly since getting it.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is a fun, entertaining game. If your bored, download and play. The characters are funny as well. Great for kids to adults!
B004WESFZW|4.0|Gave it four stars for two reasons. First, Damon carries an otherwise unbelievable script which passes the Suspend Disbelief Test. Second, I'm a sucker for a credible love story. This script is more about love and devotion than special effects...which has quite a lot of. What would Hollywood do without green screens ?  Regardless, Damon just,doesn't know how to deliver less than a believable character...or salvage an otherwise strange script.
B0097C8XL0|5.0|Best game ever it has cute animations ausome quality and u get coins or fish fast I love it get the game!!!!!
1451695195|5.0|This book has been very interesting to me.  Dr. Alexander not only relates his experiences but als the events his family was experiencing and going through.  This is a very informative and presents a sense of real!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I can't put it down. I love the minions. I can't wait to get all the power ups. Would love to see another boss fight
B0028RXXFC|5.0|The man who is very difficult to gift loved this one!!  He was a big fan when this was playing on HBO and was super happy to get his own,view it when ever you want, copy.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|I thought that it would be find game that I would really enjoy searching for the missing items, but this game, the missing item is found in a more off location that does not match.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|Tom Cruise does action. I can't help but think of &#34;Mission Impossible&#34; when I see him in an action flick, but this one is much different. The Jack Reacher character is brand new to me, so I enjoyed getting to know the character a little bit. The storyline was compelling to me. Jack Reacher's back story being a mystery is a good teaser to keep a series going.
B0009IOR6Q|5.0|She says this is one of her favorites! This young actor is quite a versatile talent and has been a delight since Benny & Joon.
B00BYKIKJS|5.0|This is a superlative movie.<br />Jennifer Lawrence is great, and Bradley Cooper is brilliant, giving proof that all the movies he produces he turns into gold.<br />The story is a very unusual one, and i enjoyed every minute of this film.<br />Very well produced, great cast (fantastic DeNiro), captivating script and story line.<br />You're in for a treat.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|It's not fair to give 4 stars simply because the author's other books are 5s (in my mind) and to me they were just a tiny bit stronger ... but this was another great one. Hosseni deftly moves back and forth between continents and timelines and crafts a story that is once again eye opening and thought provoking with twists and turns that keep the reader fully engaged. Great book -- especially for anyone who liked the first two.
B00CWV8TIU|4.0|Beautiful, argute and sagacious plot, carried out by a first class cast.<br />This movie definitely builds suspense in a well crafted crescendo, and will leave most people satisfied.<br />I haven't given it 5 stars because i felt there were a couple of minor inconsistencies, but i thoroughly enjoyed it and will watch it again.
