B009K0P10K|5.0|Keeps up a fast pace and has lots of action.  Good acting and the characters make you feel better about you own honesty and kindness.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I'm not a big fan of animated games, but this is a great one, woth NOTHING inmature in it :)
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|I would have given five stars if there hasn't been so much running back and forth  without a solid indication of what might be need next. It would have helped if the journal notes were more accurate as there were many items needed  and those of us with CRS can't remember where we saw things. The map doesn't help much as it doesn't give you a look at a picture of a location when tapped to remind us. Otherwise I would say that it is interesting (most story lines are not) and the mini games were good.
B0014Z4ON4|2.0|Somehow, they dropped the ball on this one.  It just didn't ring true.  Action was good but story line just didn't make it.  In all the reviews I've read on this one, they are always bad.  I guess it was because they portraid Indy as less than the super hero that he is.  Never show the hero as vulnerable to anything!  If it wasn't for Harrison Ford in this, the movie would have been a flop for sure.  As it was, it barely made box office.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Loved these first 5 books in the series. Looking forward to reading more...Hope they are as good as these first 5.
B000J3OTSM|4.0|This is a lively and overall entertaining movie to watch with friends.  It's hard not to like Channing Tatum, he's so good looking and charming.
B00BHMF578|5.0|A stellar cast and a history lesson in the making. I wished I have went to the theater to view it

B004XQYBA2|4.0|It is broken up into various levels of difficulty making it easy to navigate and choose.  The difficulty tree coud have been condensed but that is minor.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Excellent free app of the day. good and challenging match three game. nice backgrounds and good graphics. I would definitely recommend this to my mother.
B009O2XY12|4.0|i don't see where this is where is this located at Idk where this game is at I havent played this before!1
B007MCTTHY|5.0|I loved this game.  The first couple of tries were way too easy so I almost gave up.  I kept on playing and had so much fun.  Some of them really stumped me and it took a little while to complete.  It really made me think and I loved it.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Best show ever! I hope there are many more seasons. This show keeps me wanting more. I can't wait to see what happens!
B003B02PEU|3.0|Nice narrative of the south, but very predictable.  It does hold the reader's interest and all the stereotypes are included.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is a great little app and very necessary to live life by. If you love the WORD then get this app.
B006LSZECO|3.0|Novel was fun, but also over-hyped. Was expecting a lot of twists, but was hoping the overall story would be more believable.
0123694965|5.0|I read several books on game design before, including Level Up by Scott Rogers. But no book has truly opened my mind to game design as Art of Game Design. Schell doesn't just tell you what makes a good game, he guides you step by step into the mindset of a game designer. After reading Art of Game Design, I began thinking about games differently and truly understood the job of a game designer. Game design is about creating experiences, and Schell illustrates this perfectly. Each chapter builds upon the knowledge of the previous chapter up until Schell begins discussing the ethics and social responsibilities of a game designer. Schell illustrates design perspectives using \\"lenses,\\" which divide questions a game designer must make into little modules. Many of the 100 are great, but many of the ones later do feel very stretched.<br /><br />Overall, Art of Game Design is a great book, regardless of whether you're starting out or already have a career. If you truly want to start thinking like a game designer, this is the book to read.
B005USZYDU|5.0|I'd recommend this book to anyone who enjoys reading detective stories, especially with a young kid being the star of the story.
B006MW3V6U|4.0|Some content not consistent with the era but very entertaining. Not a family series as some topics inappropriate for all ages
B005COO1X6|4.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this book. Wished it was longer, but i can't think of a Stephen King book I haven't wished that on. Amazing how a good author can draw you in so quick, which is completely necessary on singles. I feel the book worthy of 5 stars in content and quality, but the pace did seem rushed, as if to insure the story would stay short and quick to read (and write).
B004EPYZU8|5.0|Let me just say that I was waiting forever to see this movie. The trailer was badass, the sneak peeks were awesome, just the whole production looked like it was going to be mind-blowing. And upon buying the DVD, I discovered that this movie fell nothing short of my expectations.<br />Now, keep in mind that there are some really metaphorical and surreal elements in this film, which is why many people hated it; they just didn't get it. The basic storyline is this: A girl named Babydoll (played by Emily Browning, chick from Lemony Snicket) loses her mother and is left to protect her sister from their stepfather. When she tries to kill him in self-defense but accidentally kills her sister, her stepfather sends her to a mental institution, where a lobotomy is performed. It is here where the real story begins. Right before the lobotomy, Babydoll pictures herself as a newly arrived virgin at a brothel, where she is forced to dance for men. She makes a few friends there and promises them to help find a way out. Babydoll then pictures herself in several surreal and dream-like scenarios that mirror her and the girls obtaining several items that are mandatory for their escape. The only thing is, the last item is a mystery, one they will have to figure out for themselves.<br />I personally enjoyed the hell out of this film. The main reason it received so much criticism is because it spreads the message of female empowerment but depicts the girls in a male-dominated world in which they dress in skimpy clothing and are almost sexually assaulted on a few occasions. But that's the whole point of this film; it's about overcoming your restrictions and limitations to free your soul. As stated towards the end: &#34;You have all the weapons you need; now fight.&#34;<br />And by the way, the visuals are the crown jewel for this movie. From 20-foot-tall Japanese samurais and steampunk Nazi zombies to giant dragons in an orc-ifested castle and humanoid robots on a distant planet, the movieis like a giant roller coaster.<br />If you love obscure films, this one is for you. Everything about this movie will leave you breathless. If I could give it 10 stars, I would. Sucker Punch kicks ass!
B006LSZECO|5.0|you now how most books say you cant put it down, well this novel fits that cliche. and Flynn wrote nick dunnes character so well that he remained likeable throughout, my only wish was that he had found something for Boney.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I watched the walking dead since the first season and since then it has kept me on the edge just like the show Lost.
B0018LX9T4|2.0|How do you find an ideal wife?  This movie says the answer to that is find yourself a good-<br />looking woman who slices herself to ribbons and then beat the stuffings out of her.<br />The actors in this movie, both male and female, are supposedly first class.  This is the<br />craziest serious movie I have ever seen.
B008DW6VOQ|4.0|This app truely gives me a little of everything I want for a quick look at the daily market.  I especially like the &#34;news&#34; feature and the ability to pick and then follow my own stocks.  Very easy to use the features.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|This game is filled with excitement the under water things to hunt are so fun to see your shark get bigger and bigger and the people it eats is sorta funny to.I think it is my best game so far.
B00AFEY354|4.0|My son had to read this book for school. I read it as well so that I could quiz him on it. I loved the book. The movie was almost as good. I thought the casting was great. They could have developed the characters a little more.  I wouldn't have been mad if the movie was a few minutes longer to do so.
B000BN0YG6|5.0|The original 1972 movie of \\"Sleuth\\", with Laurence Olivier and Michael Caine, was a wonder on many levels:  great acting, good setting, amazing plot switches, sudden transitions between humor and suspense, great play back and forth across the line of belief, reality, and surprise.  I've been hoping for years that it would come out on DVD; our VHS tape deteriorated over time, loss of color and focus. I have not purchased this VHS version now available from Amazon because of concern that it may be similarly deteriorated.  I'd rather have it on DVD (but over $100?  too much!); may yet buy this VHS to give it a try.<br /><br />I just watched the 2008 re-make, with Caine in the Olivier role and Jude Law in the Caine role; perhaps it would work better if I'd never seen the earlier version, but I'd say it just didn't measure up.  Something, hard to define, too deeply cold and cynical behind the characters (and the setting matched that, though at first it seemed an ingenious update of the quirky playful mechanisms of the original).  Perhaps it comes down to this:  in the 1972 version, Caine as the younger character was likeable in spite of all his faults; Olivier less so.  In this version Caine in the other role was still likeable in spite of all his faults; and Law less so --- and in that case the ending couldn't achieve the same sad justice and tragedy.
B00AHTYGRW|2.0|No problems with the Blu-ray or DVD but I didn't realize when ordering that it was an UltraViolet digital copy.  Disappointed I can't include this movie with other digital content in iTunes.  Need to pay more attention next time.
B00A0SKFLG|3.0|This movie was not as inspiring as the original. Yes the tech was better, and the story was different. And I may or may not watch it again on TV. But would never purchase to watch again.
B008L40Q7E|4.0|Of course there are out of date references and colloquialisms - even some non-PC language. But Ian Fleming was above all else a good storyteller, and nothing beats a good story. On top of that, you can find a goodly number of what are now over borrowed plot devices and contrivances, they are still fun. And the villain meets a very fitting end. Pure gold from a master's pen.
B00BESKTMG|1.0|I'm almost a lover of kong fu movies. But this one was a flop. It was just to unreal and corny for me. It was a cross between a kong fu movie and a Freddy Cuger (Cruger) movie. With spurting blood and bad acting. It took the zing out of the feel of Kung Fu Movies.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|Helen Hunt, whose performance as an empathetic sex surrogate who helps her iron lung patient to experience normal sex, tries her best to keep herself emotionally neutral so she can truly help her patient.  William Macy is outstanding as the patient's counsellor- priest.  The counseling sessions, conducted at the front of the church, with parishioners coming and going, is a hilarious tour de force.  Both Hunt and Macy give outstanding performances in roles one has not seen them in before!
B00APJLFEG|3.0|This movie was just okay, almost boring. Maybe out of my appreciation level. Let the kids have it, or not.
B008D4AKYQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite prog releases of 2012. Thought provoking lyrics, lush harmonies, intelligent song writing, great musicianship- enough said?<br />Fans of early Genesis, Barclay James Harvest, Strawbs etc. will LOVE this. \\"Judas Unrepentant\\" is a modern day classic- BRILLIANT songwriting.<br />Buy this- you definately need to take Big Big Train for a ride!
B009KEN87O|5.0|lots of fun. couldn't stop till my kindle battery died. love the old school space invader graphics but much faster and more challenges.
B008673ZAQ|3.0|Excellent novel similar to fifty shades of grey but has a much better story line. The author gets more in depth with the story line an characters and you don't want to put this book down
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I just started this game but I love it already! Its real fun and if you've watched my little pony I think you'll like this game too!
B0082Z1CVQ|5.0|I read this as a teenager (many years ago), it is better than remembered,  has excellent characterizations and historical settings.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|I like how this app tells me how many hours and minutes I have for the different parts of my kindle and the fact it warns me when I need to charge my battery.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|A beautifully put together app. Very cleverly executed with cute story line. Great way to  chill after a really stressful day. Well worth the $.
B005BRS8Z6|4.0|It is good book if you want to learn how to love and appreciate everything around you. The book gravitate around the maxim of Abe Lincoln &#34; most folks are about as happy as they make their mind to be&#34;. I particularly like the advice of not taking things personally and loving people the way they
B007CKNX28|5.0|Great album from start to finish. Covers a lot of ground stylistically, but is consistently good throughout. Buy this album.
0307346617|5.0|this was a well-written, compelling story, zombies or no. I can't see how a movie could be made that could do it justice. I guess we shall see.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Loved it. It's fast paced and has just the right ammount of challenge. The perspective change during invincibility is really fun. Good spin on an old favorite.
1400049628|5.0|He's a big zombie fan overall and gave it a high rating. Looks like Mr. Brooks has hit another home run.
B008JEJN8O|4.0|Amazon doesn't have a large supply of Crocs in my size (9 men's) so I was stuck buying this one. I bought for my Afghani tour to use to/from the shower and in the shower since you don't want to shower barefooted out here.<br /><br />Fitment: the shoe is wide, really wide. I have about a 1&#34; space between the shoe and my foot but it does give me room to quickly slip my foot in/out when I need to. I walk with my feet pointed forward, but if your walking gait is more like Charlie Chaplin (toes pointing outward) you may have issues with this extra space when walking long distances in these..<br /><br />The sole is supportive enough with good tread to manage over 1-1/2&#34; to 2&#34; gravel without feeling the rocks beneath my feet. The insole has a ridge across the width (where your toes attach to the feet) and is generally molded like the bottom of your foot with a bit of an arch. The caveat with this is that water tends to puddles in the toes and heels and will require you to keep dry by propping the shoes upside down, toe up, at an angle so the water can drain off the heels.<br /><br />The only other OSD thing I have noticed with these clogs is the cutout at the front. I have a couple longer toes and sometimes the tips will either poke through that vent (recall the molded insole keeping my foot forward in these) or rub along the top of the vent when walking.<br /><br />Molded insole, nice ventilation and overall size make these great for shower shoes. Foot slipping is minimal, even when wet unlike my flip flops and I anticipate using these for flying or using on a beach this summer.
B0085RQLXK|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, this is a fantastic album by a band that has never dissappointed me. I think it has something for fans of all eras of the band, some 70's sounding stuff. some 80's/90's ballads. I love all eras of the band so i'm happy to hear both sides of this terrific band
B009KEN87O|5.0|They really integrated the retro with the abilities of today's hardware. They kept the graphics 8-bit in appearance, but not completely. It doesn't overwhelm you with the improvements, but rather enhance the experience casually. Invincibility mode is where it stands out. Good job dev!
B0036SUQWA|5.0|This movie is so funny - we still have no idea what it is about - even after seeing it 3 times - but we love it!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a sweet thought provoking book. I am definitely giving this to my kids to read and reflect on.

B004EPZ06Q|5.0|My wife and I are in our early 30's and as vanilla as it gets.  We thought this movie was very funny, however not even close to family appropriate.
B007N5YIUS|4.0|Good game, but the adds are kind of annoying. It's a free game so it is not a big deal.
B00881VLCE|3.0|Entertaining but sometimes frustrating when the whole puzzle dissapears from the screen when there are only a few pieces left!
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|I used to read the entire series every year. I had some concerns with this, especially since they were going to force pushing this book out to 3 movies. This was a concern because the Lord of the Rings books were each progressively more complicated than the previous ones, and this book was very simple by comparison. Honestly as far as the books go, The Hobbit was really written more in the style and complexity of current \\"teenager\\" books. Not that this is a bad thing, it made the book very easy to read and still enjoyable. But to make a single movie of the more complicated books and 3 out of the lightest version of Tolkien's masterpieces seemed forced.<br /><br />I saw it on opening day in the theater and I was overjoyed. They added a separate story line (Two actually, and I won't go into details so no spoilers here) that is interesting and exciting to watch. These added story lines were not in the books at all - and as a LOTR purist I am surprised at how happy I was with them. It still very much has the feel of a Tolkien story and didn't take away from the rest of the story - in fact they managed to enhance parts of it with background and other information.<br /><br />As far as the quality of the actual physical product it is excellent there as well. I was very happy to see that there were subtitles - the original posting here did not include information about included subtitles. The sharpness of the Blu Ray came across very well, crystal clear production and transition to disk. The edition I purchased has 3D, BluRay and DVD formats together.<br /><br />For most of the other concerns of many people's reviews, they just don't bother me nearly as much. Especially with regards to an extended version likely to come out late in the year. I simply did not want to wait, and I'm glad that I didn't. I may still get the extended versions when they come out too, but that will be a game time decision. I may also just wait for the price to come down then, who knows. Right now I'm not worried about it at all - I got to watch this movie on my TV in my home the day it came out because I had it delivered that way - and if you were to tell me then that I should have waited I would have laughed at the idea of it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series and really want to own and watch this movie, get it now instead of waiting. If you're an ultra purist, or really feel that you're being ripped off because another edition will eventually come out - then of course it's your choice to wait - but also think about the fact that every big production movie always comes out with other editions eventually. It's the nature of the business.<br /><br />-D'm not worried about it at all - I got to watch this movie on my TV in my home the day it came out because I had it delivered that way - and if you were to tell me then that I should have waited I would have laughed at the idea of it.<br /><br />If you are a fan of the series and really want to own and watch this movie, get it now instead of waiting.

B008IJT0CE|5.0|With this app my daughter falls asleep so easily. There is a nice selection of sounds to choose from. I would definitely recommend this app,<br />it was worth my money.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Always enjoyed Brisbane books and this one didn't disappoint. Love a happy ending. Anyone who enjoys court cases with a twist will enjoy this one.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|This is addictive and fun. It's like getting Super Mario beach buggy for free. Highly recommend. Collecting coins while driving so you can buy upgrades. You won't regret getting this game.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved it! I teach middle school and my students would love this, it brings all their favorites into one story!
B00007KWHN|4.0|I love the cd, and it's great that it's digitally remastered. I thought it was a little lame that the &#34;bonus version&#34; of the song was really just the radio version.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|i liked the book allot and am in to books like that and hope to read more books by L. Frank Baum
B0054SMIH6|1.0|Very poor video.  Movie stopped playing and five minutes of stopping and starting.  VERY DISAPPOINTED.  Will probably not rent another movie.
B002HSSAY6|5.0|Looked fantastic!  Highly recommended!!  Streaming to Xbox 360 worked like a charm.  About as clear as Netflix quality.  No buffering issues.
B009WO7NQO|5.0|A lot of people love Star Wars. A lot of people love Angry Birds. Lucas Arts and Rovio were aware of that, and that caused for the creation of Angry Birds Star Wars. Angry Birds Star Wars layers your favorite bird-slinging game with one of the world's greatest franchises ever.<br /><br />Angry Birds Star Wars's gameplay remains mostly the same as other Angry Birds games, but brings new Star Wars themed additions ( laser blasters, lightsabers, the Force, etc.) to deliver a rich and engaging gaming experience. The HD visuals improve, as always, the soundtrack is incredible, and the replay value is endless.<br /><br />If you love Angry Birds and/or Star Wars, Angry Birds Star Wars is absolutely for you.<br /><br />May the Force be with you, always.

B008LV05EG|1.0|Hailing all the way from the uk bring's you yet another mediocre mainstream electro pop singer, a singer if you can call her that. Rita ora's type of sound bring's you the same formulaic standard electronica sound mixed with very substantial vocals at best and awful song's at worst. Rita ora here displays no talent at all in her debut album and somewhat produces a slight case of ignorance in her song's but then again who doesn't in the s***ty music scene today. While i will admit that her so called supposed hit single &#34;how we do&#34; is catchy, it isn't at all enough for her to be considered a true musician, till then this will be another disposable awful hack with no skill's to develop.
B003730LRY|5.0|I enjoyed it when the movie first came out, but its an older movie which does not require an HD upgrade.  Still, a fun movie.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|I have always loved this movie. It does not get old. Love it even more as an ex-salior and seeing the ship board errors :)
B009K86D86|3.0|Just ok... didn't really tell us anything everyone shouldn't already have known.  But its a good motivator for everyone to try and eat better and make better choices
B007REV4YI|5.0|Great movie and the extra digital copy was a nice addition.  After 50 years, the Bond formula has kept up with the times and continues to excite.  Daniel Craig is the most dynamic Bond ever.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Good book well written realistic point of cancer and its victims, very sad read but beautiful and realistic. The ending is not written out but you pretty much know how this will end.
B00A0MJA1I|4.0|This was one of my favorite Disney movies as a child and now I wanted to have my grandkids experience the magic.  They watch it every time they come over.  Of course, they haven't let me watch any of the extras yet :-) but I'll get to them eventually.

0765325950|3.0|Have been reading this series for years and trying to imagine how it would end.  This was an incredibly long book for what it accomplished.  Others in the series were much more enjoyable, but at least I now have &#34;closure&#34;.
0547366205|2.0|I have &#34;Time for Bed&#34; by Mem Fox and it is my favorite book so I ordered this book as it is also by Fox. I am not a tough board book critic, they all have something cute to offer but I was geniuenly dissapointed in this one. The pictures are simple, don't catch my toddlers attention and have huge plain white backgrounds. The story is not very charming or cute in my opinion. I would strongly recommend you pass on this one and get Fox's &#34;Time For Bed&#34; instead :).
B004SIP9Z6|5.0|I had only heard of Frank Miller before this film came out and even seen some of his art but never found myself all that interested. Thanks to Robert Rodriguez and Co. in realizing material of quality, to such a magnitude, that I have since not looked at movies the same way since.

B008XBCJ34|4.0|My wife loves this movie! I think it was cleverly created, but the story line is similar to other movies.
030759565X|4.0|On her blog Deb is known for her charming stories about cooking & her great recipes.  In her book she seems to have focused on charm to the detriment of the great recipes.  Well, they're still there but, as others have reviewed, buried/scattered within the narrative.  My recommendation is to read the entire story.  Then go back & carefully re-read while using a highlighter to pick out only the recipe ingredients & instructions.  And, of course, as you always should with any unfamiliar recipe, do mise-en-place (sp?) & read thru again before beginning.
B009KEN87O|5.0|There was a time when we would have plugged many quarters in a machine to play this game. this is an awesome old style arcade game that offers challenge. Very responsive and very well done.
B00274EYKY|4.0|Mickey Rourke delivers his best in this movie, worth the watch, it can be watched as a mans movie or as a couples movie either way itll make you feel something for the guy.
B009M7G1PU|5.0|classy and sexy. i an not a fan of romance novels at all and was nauseated at all the fan fair of unintelligent fluff books like the Twilight series and Fifty Shades of Grey(tried reading both series, it was immediately apparent that it was a waste of time). Lady Chatterlys Lover is a beautifully written book, with ample reasoning for all the sex that is portrayed. Wonderful read!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Really cool. The first one is still fun to play, but this one is fun with the chase and graphics are great.

I have owned the 405CX for about a year now and whilst no super athlete, I do use it for short runs about 3 - 4 times a week.  I think I seem to have had less issues than some of the reviewers that have had problems with this watch and can only comment on my experiences.  The watch takes some setting up as it has tons of features - but for someone that likes lots of stats - its great.  You can display multiple sets of info - ie: heart rate,HR%, distance, time, etc and you can have multiple screens with data.  The watch can either slowly rotate through those screens or you can touch the bazel to move to these screens.<br /><br />Previous reviewers have commented on sweat and non responsive bazels.  Yes - I agree - as I am someone that sweats a lot - moving the bazel between screens can be hard (non responsive) with sweaty fingers.  I have found I simply wipe my fingers on my sweat shirt first then tap or slide my finger on the bazel to change screens.  No real big deal.  The other thing I have found is that I tend to use only a few key stats - HR, pace, distance, time and I usually just stay on the screen that has that info, as opposed to screen changing or leaving auto change on.<br /><br />People have commented on water effecting this watch.  I tend to try not run in the rain too much - but when I have - I haven't had any issues with water effecting the watch - assuming I am not trying to change screens though because of the sweat issue and the non responsive bazel when trying to move it with wet fingers.<br /><br />The satellite can sometimes take anything from 20 seconds to 1 minute to lock on - but I have found that once locked on - its held and I have not had any issues with the signal dropping off, even when running under trees.  I usually put the satellite search on as I'm getting ready - so its normally not an issue as its locked on by the time I'm ready to start my run.<br /><br />The only annoying thing about this watch - but also not a deal breaker - is that it only holds its charge for about a few days when its not in use.  The newer models can be switched off.  However, I simply check it the night before or every few days and put it on the charger if need be.<br /><br />The ability to upload this to Garmin Connect and review your stats and track where you have been on a map is also a great feature.<br /><br />As far as loosing complete charge goes - I have had this happen on maybe only less than a handfull of times since purchasing this watch.  A full reset or putting it back on the charger over night sorted out the issue.  Again - this has only happened maybe 3 - 4 times in over a years worth of use - so not an issue that has really bothered me.<br /><br />All in all, yes - moving between screens with sweaty fingers can be hit and miss and the satellite may take a few seconds longer than what you want to lock on, plus the charge on the watch only holds for a week at most - depending on how often you use the watch - but you can easily work around all those issues.  Given my experiences with this watch, would I buy it again - absolutely!  In fact - Amazon just had it at a super low price (even cheaper than what I paid for it originally - and that I thought was a bargain at the time...still is, I think, even though its a discontinued model) and I couldn't pass the opportunity to purchase another one - either as a spare or maybe even a gift!  For what I paid originally for this watch and how well its worked for me so far - its worth the 5 stars...even with the minor issues noted above.
B0007MWZEK|5.0|Love it! Very good value for the money. I keep this in my kitchen for quick clean ups. Works great and I don't have to ge the big vac out! Thank you!

B004XIZN5M|5.0|I found the content informative and the author's style relatively entertaining. I have been using the training system set forth by this book with great results. I have been able to reach the master step on 4 out of the big 6 and I am confident I will be able to achieve the last 2. I started out with a strength level around level 5-6 on most of the big 6 and have been very happy with my progress. Wade's system has worked for me.

B001VFEKOK|5.0|I love the diversity of the music on the album.  I could listen to it over and over.  I don't think you have to be a fan of the movie to enjoy the music.
B009LDCZ7I|4.0|I enjoyed this very much and found it suspenseful and easy to follow but not easy to solve<br />the mystery.  It is an action film.
B008VBYN80|3.0|Well, what can i say. its a very fun game..but sometimes it just doesn't let me check things. like the guild hall. or my friends worlds. this seems to be a big problem with<br />gameloft city building games..
B008FYZIVY|5.0|I found this series to be very enjoyable, much like soap operas.  The characters are all<br />interesting and each has their own story that fits in the series.  Reminds me of the old<br />series &#34;Upstairs Downstairs&#34;.

B003VXMMTK|5.0|I read Tess of the D'urbervilles by Thomas Hardy several years ago.  The film Tess of the D'urbervilles starring Gemma Arterton followed the book beautifully.  Sometimes after reading a book one is dissappointed when viewing the movie but this was not the case with Tess.  The scenery in the film was exactly how I pictured it to be when I was reading the novel.  My favorite part of the film was the way the characters were portrayed and how their acting made you empathize with their plight.  It was convenient to be able to view the film on my computer through my Amazon account.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Great box in every way possible and very pleasent surprise for me was that the movies have finnish subtitles, which is not very common in region A releases! Only region A is mentioned on the covers, but the discs are playable also on the region B players.

B0099Y2MYK|3.0|I am enjoying the series, but this set of DVDs had a number of glitches--unexpected pauses, mostly, that interrupted the story line and were only remedied by back-tracking and re-playing.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|It was overall a good book and I loved the love between katniss and peta even if it was fake for katniss. Was adorable.
1400069807|5.0|This is a truly fascinating book. Author Michael Moss has done an impressive job with reporting the facts without any preachiness. The most controversial part of this book is the subtitle, \\"How the Food Giants Hooked Us.\\" Some reviewers have taken issue with this statement, pointing out that we all have the will power to just say no to processed foods.<br /><br />However, the growing levels of obesity, diabetes, and heart disease in America can not be explained away by saying that there's been some sort of erosion of free will amongst the populace. I suspect anyone who says otherwise has not read past the first few pages of this exhaustive treatise on the ins and outs of the wildly competitive food biz.<br /><br />What this books does, at length (and, at times, with some redundancy) is give us a detailed understanding of the ways in which processed food manufacturers engineer and market their products to make them as alluring (or addicting) as possible. This is no secret. The scientists who have worked on processed foods are mostly proud of their science. Interestingly, it is amongst the marketers where one finds more remorse after the fact.<br /><br />I was particularly and personally interested in reading this book after having read an excerpt online. I grew up on processed foods and have a great fondness for many of the brands that are written about in this book. However, I now eat a plant based whole foods diet. I also found that it was far easier to steer clear of certain foods, as opposed to moderate, in much the same way as those who have quit alcohol. I have never been able to curb my enthusiasm for mac and cheese or fettucini alfredo, for instance. After reading this book, I now understand the mechanisms at work.<br /><br />I didn't read this book for absolution, but it was certainly eye opening to discover that my inability to eat what I knew was an appropriate serving size was not a personal failing, but a normal biological response. I don't blame the big companies for that. They do what all companies want to do in a capitalist society - sell, and sell well. If you are curious about how they do this, this book is a must read.companies for that. They do what all companies want to do in a capitalist society - sell, and sell well. If you are curious about how they do this, this book is a must read.
B0042RUMIW|5.0|Claro que por supuesto que si lo recomendaría<br />Esta genial simplemente me encanto<br />La entrega fue muy buena y rápida
B00BWJARHO|1.0|I rented the online video version, and it wouldn't play, but kept putting up bogus messages that I was already watching other movies using my amazon account.<br /><br />Eventually I got part of it to play, but the quality was so bad it's unwatchable for anyone sensitive to migraines.<br /><br />It should be noted that my devices were not the problem -- they've streamed all my other videos from amazon with no trouble.<br /><br />They don't make it easy to find the information necessary to get a refund for a video you can't even watch. My initial searching got me nowhere, which I why I posted my original review. A commenter gave me enough hints that I was eventually able to get tech support chat, but again, they don't make it easy.<br /><br />The tech support person was helpful and issued a refund. But save yourself a big headache and don't throw your money away on this.
B007SGM084|5.0|Best book I have EVER read!!! :) Hope that everyone enjoyed it as much as I did...hope that there is more

B005OCFHHK|5.0|It was interesting to open this up and see Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone as the first title, but it does not reduce the quality and the price was exceptionally reasonable.
B007B6VOG0|5.0|They show an amazing range of styles. all executed with great confidence and style.  Hope to hear more from them.
0439023513|4.0|I am about half way through the book and it is as exciting at the first Hunger Games book.  I am looking forward to viewing the second book, Catching Fire. coming to the movie screen in the fall.  When I finish this book, I will have read all the Hunger Games books.  I gave it four stars only because I had read the other two and knew what the story was about.  I give a five star to the trio.
1609611543|1.0|He says to give up wheat but says you can eat all kinds of fattening meat.  This book does not make sense.  To bake or cook the way that they explain in the book and not easy nor affordable to the average person.

B006LSZECO|5.0|For the first time in years I gasped, and talked out loud while reading the book.  I find this author's creativity a bottomless pit!  Kudos
B004ZMWUCU|5.0|I loved this story and didn't want it to end. The characters were well drawn and real, the descriptions so fun to read and served to lighten the dark, painful, and harsh reality of Jamie's young life. The story is well crafted and McKenna shows a command of language and restraint in its use that results in allowing the reader to live the story too.
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Wreck it ralph was an entertaining movie. I felt the story was good and overall quality of the picture and sound was great. This film is entertaining not only for kids but adults to so don't be turned off by that.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|Although this is a very long book, it moves along because it is well-written. It brings in a lot of themes including the history of computing, the creative process,  and building/managing an innovative company. Also, I finally understand Steve Jobs.<br />Since I was a computer programmer and manager during the time period covered by this book,  I was more in the Bill Gates camp<br />and never appreciated Apple products until the Ipod. Now I forgive Jobs for frustrating us so much.
B0080BFWE0|5.0|The two dizzy California girls are hilarious.  Be prepared for lots of charming laughs.  It's a shame there was never a reprise.
B0060MYM7O|5.0|Product was as described and arrived as promised (I pre-ordered it).  Was a little concerned when there were only two dvd's for the entire season, but the episodes are front and back, so they are all there.

B00A8ECU24|4.0|I'm a brony yes yes I know. (I'm not gay) but this is a great game to play. I gave it 4 stars because of the adds in the begging get annoying. but a great game all in all, but make sure u have atleast 1 friend with this game to help you out or it will be hard to complete some quests.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|It had so many twists and turns it kept me on the edge of my seat.  It also shows how women's lives were changed by the war.
B003DZX3US|5.0|One of my daughters favorite movies.  This made a wonderful after Christmas present for her, she watches it several times a week.
B00AO686MY|2.0|Perhaps I had my expectations set too high.  Maybe Blu Ray transfers like Blade Runner spoiled me.  For the 25th anniversary/first time on Blu Ray release of this movie, I guess I was expecting more.  I was not impressed in the least with the video quality.  The movie itself is just as I remembered seeing in the theater many years ago with my girlfriend (now wife) - excellent.  This transfer however was a huge disappointment.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I tried it and wow do I love this game so cool love the challenge my friend did the last level first and I was really impressed
B00APUYWYA|2.0|I had an emergency happen and didn't get to watch it.......so...I didn't like &#34;that&#34;, I guess the movie was ok. I'll try again later.
B008XX6J4C|5.0|Their music portray their exceptional creativity and wonderful talent.<br />Music is something I am most passionate about hence, I am also most critical.<br />But The Piano Guys' works have not disappointed me.<br />I am looking forward to more of their music.<br />I hope they can feature more well-loved music of the recent decades and sprinkle it with their own artistic (in lieu of fairy) dust!<br />It would be interesting to also hear what they can do with some well-loved Broadway music!<br />Thanks for sharing your music to the world, The Piano Guys!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|It's a little adicting. This is a good game to play when you have a couple minutes without Internet access. I find myself playing a game or two waiting at the school for my kids to get released.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|This book reminded me of the entertaining Science Fiction I read many years ago. Not complex and epic, but a unique story that catches your imagination, and you become invested in the outcome. It reads so quickly it almost feels like a short story. I highly recommend it. Now to the author. Use your imagination in a different land with a different story. A sequel or continuation of this story would waste your talent. Thanks.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I started using this game on my Windows Phone 8 and then found it on the Kindle. I prefer to draw on the big Kindle screen and it's nice that I can use the same account on either device depending on which I have with me at the time.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Good. Very good. Some great episodes and a few that were a little flat. Overall I believe all three seasons have been awesome.Watched all 3 in 3 days because I wanted more. Still do!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|I have Avast on all my desktops and laptops and now I have it on my phone. It works good and doesn't suck up a lot of memory.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Great DVD to own on BluRay.  Also a very good price for the entire series and in one conveneient package.  A must for anyone who hasn't seen this series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Couldn't stop reading it! One of the best book I have ever read. Love love loved it! A must for everyone to read!
B009FZHYKU|5.0|World falls apart as the dead rise up and become the worlds most dangerous predators. The irony of the series name the walking dead, to whom does it refer the walkers who search for flesh or the living trying to scrap by knowing it is only a matter of time. Myself, I am a huge fan of the comic book series as I have read the first 100 issues and like most books they are better than their on screen counterpart. The storyline itself does not directly mirror the comic as to give the fans something exciting and unexpected. I love the addition of Darlyn and Merle who were never in the comics, so their whole background and what they bring to the storyline is all a mystery. But what has truly always made me a fan of the series was the struggle Rick has trying to maintain a moral fortiude in a world where the rules no longer apply.
B001NLL8LA|5.0|Lee  Child delivers another fantastic read.  I'm sad to have read he's having it up in the near future. What will I do without Reacher  to entertain me?
B00BESNKB8|4.0|One of the better movies I have seen in a while. Easy to access through amazon prime. Good job amazon.
B007ZI06FE|5.0|I flew through this as fast as I could. I am new to the steam punk genre, and bought this on a whim after seeing it for sale and liking the cover. Thank goodness I did, because now I'm addicted. It was very well written with the perfect amount of tension, action and romance. I will be purchasing every thing Bec McMaster puts out from here on out!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I did a marathon; watching the episodes back to back.  Thoroughly enjoyed the experience.  Well done and entertaining program.  Looking forward to Season 3.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|Great graphics and challenging. Takes a bit to get used to but easy to learn. I like that the controls can be switched from tilt to touch.
B0060MYM3S|5.0|If you have not seen game of thrones, this is a show you need to see.  It keeps your interest and keeps you guessing.  I got this for my dad who loves the game civilization and he loved this show! I had to buy him the second season to complete his collection.

B000000OU0|4.0|\\"Just for the record, we never broke up. We just took a fourteen year vacation.\\"<br /><br />With those words, the Eagles kicked off their first concert in over a decade for an MTV broadcast special. The band took it all in stride, playing a tight set, leaning heavily on their most popular album (5 of 11 live tracks are from \\"Hotel California\\"), and adding four new songs to the disc as a bonus. The best of those four, \\"Get Over It,\\" is the hardest rocking song the band has ever produced. Based on a Chuck Berry riff and Don Henley's annoyance with \\"a whole lot of people saying don't blame me,\\" it's an epic rant.<br /><br />But no one is fooled by the new material. It's the classics they came to hear, and Eagles bests are as good as classic rock gets. The band does keep it mostly mellow, with favorites \\"Tequila Sunrise,\\" \\"I Can't Tell You Why\\" and \\"Wasted Time\\" all being mid-tempo to downright slowpoke, while it isn't till the end that the electric guitars come out for \\"Take It Easy\\" and \\"Life In The Fast Lane.\\" In fact. there is little straying from the original arrangements. The exception is the Spanish guitar version of \\"Hotel California,\\" which significantly alters the opening of that song.<br /><br />But throughout, the Eagles are in fine voice, with the ever so pristine harmonies fully intact. They turn Henley's solo song \\"New York Minute\\" into an Eagles song and the longing of the closing \\"Desperado\\" sounds as good as it did in 1973. Henley remains the band's dominant voice, singing the bulk of the material and two of the four new songs. That matters little to the audience, who cheer enthusiastically after classic after classic. Pretty much a souvenir of the band's unlikely reunion and subsequent tour, \\"Hell Freezes Over\\" is a polished document of that new beginning.
B00BLCHYKU|4.0|The series seems to have the right amount of grit, history, and action.  The actors are believable and well suited for the roles they play.  .
B001KL3GY0|3.0|Alleged to be a concept album about a hard party of a night and the following morning, Franz Ferdinand attempt to shift direction on their third album. \\"You're never going home,\\" they belt on the opening salvo, \\"Ulysses.\\" Offering their usual angular guitar attack on top of some squiggly synth lines, it's their call to being ready to party. They try to pick up the ladies (\\"No You Girls\\"), get a spot on the dance floor (the electronically extended \\"Lucid Dreams\\") and realize that it's all been a waste of time (\\"Katherine Kiss Me,\\" which sounds like an apology to \\"No You Girls\\"). It's Franz Ferdinand's most ambitious album so far.<br /><br />It's not just a boy's night out, as the longing for \\"Katherine\\" shows. They switch to the ladies' point of view for disco-fied \\"What She Came For.\\" Franz frontman Alex Kapranos lets go of the hedonist inside to let the woman try and hit on him, then lets loose with a kicking deceivingly not-disco guitar solo. That doesn't stop the band from nudging the dance floor, especially on the following track \\"Live Alone.\\" The big switch is that the crunchy guitars that made \\"Take Me Out\\" or \\"Do You Want To\\" from the previous album are strapped to throbbing basses and slinky keyboards.<br /><br />Not every band gets to try this bold a maneuver, but the Ferds pull it off neatly. Fans of the group's guitar based albums might be put off, but repeat listens reward the patient. \\"Tonight: Franz Ferdinand\\" makes the case the FF remain a band to pay attention to.

I have no complaints with the build quality which is which is quite fine, but it's worth mentioning, the Nexus will probably continue to have its battery drain even if you have it plugged in while using this SlimPort video connector.

B000UZNRS2|3.0|This is the fourth Baldacci novel that I have read. It is just okay. The plot just seems to drag a bit compared to the other books. Maybe if I had read the first Camel Club, it would have been more enjoyable as the characters would possibly be more developed.<br />On a side note for all the Baldacci novels - I do wish that the author had a better editor.  This one does not seem to know comma rules for introductory adverb clauses.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I love to read. It's like having a library in your hands. The quality of the free books offered is awesome.
B004TI5N38|4.0|I think that this is my favorite David Baldacci novel. I enjoyed the plot and found it a realistic omen of what could happen in America. John Puller is a well-drawn character - strong, moral, admirable. I hope Mr. Baldacci continues his Puller series.

B00A9T1HUO|5.0|My  first Groban cd but also worth the money.  He does his typical very nice job here; nice to listen to.  You'll not be disappointed.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|I was really looking forward to reading this 3rd story but found the ending a little bit odd which makes me think that there will be a 4th Chronicle.
B006OFN0SE|5.0|Enjoyed it a lot.  My kids learned a lot from it too; THAT was worthwhile.  It was worth the money.
030758836X|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book...couldn't put it down.<br /><br />My one gripe with it...SPOILER ALERT...I cannot imagine the female lead going to an abandoned mall to try to buy a gun, that was ludricrous to me<br /><br />Great book!!!
0142413860|5.0|My 4 year old grandson rarely sits still for stories, but the book plus the CD kept his interest throughout.  I also had this book read to me when I was a child, so it brought back great memories as well as making new memories with him.
B00BEZTMWW|5.0|On time and not a fake. What more could you ask for? Gandalf gives this product five Glamdrings. No kidding.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I loved these books, they were very creative and unlike anything else I've ever read. There were a lot of nice surprises and plot twists that didn't see coming. I've already recommend these to a bunch of friends! I can't wait for more books to come out!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Excellent playability. Old school at it's best. Space invaders meets asteroids meets galager. Love it! Played for 10 minutes and added to my top 5 list of games.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|My favorite new albumn. Play it over and over. Saw them on mumford's video, bought it, ended up my favorite new cd.
B006GHA9QQ|4.0|I wish the stars from the 25th anniversary show were on this.  I know why they aren't, but it would have made for a better show, Still it was okay.
B001ANSS5K|5.0|Not everyone is going to love Paper Towns.  You won't love it if you don't like pranking.  You won't love it if you like the pranking in Looking for Alaska (there's not enough pranking in this book).  You probably won't like the book if you can't stand nerds (the main character is a true nerd).  On the other hand, if you like reading about persistent people who care about people who don't care about themselves, and you like to read a good unrequited-love story, then you might really love this book.  I got lost in the story and didn't emerge until I had finished it in a single sitting and I am a very slow reader.  This book is the best John Green book I have read to date and I believe I have read everything he has published.  Five stars!
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|The game and missile early on are pretty easy, but I'm at a point where it will take days to complete one of them. Basically, I'm just used to faster paced games like this. Also, the social missions and queues are weird. That's why it wasn't 5 out of 5 for me at least.
B005D6O0LQ|5.0|Best ever shoes!  They're classy and comfortable - light as a feather.  I got them in navy to go with jeans, etc. Easy to pack and easy to clean when traveling.  I have foot issues and need a spacious toe box and snug heel - Jayna satisfies this need. I wear an 8 and this pair of shoes was true to size.
B005MYWZKM|5.0|Great album all the way through, and well made vinyl. Heavy 180 gram, well mastered. This is a two-record set.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|This was a great movie when I first saw it in the theater and was in great condition when it arrived in the mail.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|A great, rollicking read.  Though many found the story pointless and lacking in plot, I found that this was an appropriate second installment in the series.  Kvothe continues to build his legend, but lacks an end goal.  As such, his adventures are meandering, just as his character is meandering.<br /><br />Rothfuss takes you for a fun ride, and The Wise Man's Fear is still one of the best fantasy reads out there.
0553382179|5.0|I highly recommend the FlyLady system to anyone who has a hard time staying organized and clutter free.  I love the way she writes -  Very direct and encouraging book.  I read this, and passed it on to my sister in law.  I'll be buying more for my friends.
0062014536|3.0|Words cannot explain how disappointed and angry I am at the ending of this book. This is my first time writing a review; I am so mad.<br />Spoiler Alert:<br />The beginning started off great. It shows the perspective of Hana and Lena, which was needed to get a feel of what was happening on both sides of the resistance; however, that is mostly what it focused on. It did not focus on Julian or Alex. It did not focus on Lena's emotions, just the fact that she was getting more involved in the resistance. I felt like their should have been a demonstration of how Lena was fighting for her love for either Julian or Alex. Also, you would think it would tie in Julian's emotions since he KNOWS Lena loves Alex too. Later in the book, it skips around til Hana's wedding day. After she visits Cassie in the Crypts, it seems like her personality has turned to stone. It almost seemed like she was WANTING to marry Fred. I was hoping for a little resistance on Hana's end just because I didn't like Fred. As for the end, it ended on such broad terms; granted, the message is a good message, but it does no explaining. What happened to Fred? What choice did Lena make between Alex and Julian? What happened with the resistance? What happens to Hana? No one knows. There is no magnificient reunion between Alex and Lena. He just gives her a kiss and says \\"I will find you.\\" Totally not what I was expecting. That could have been elaborated on a lot more.<br />As an entirity, the book was well written, just had a disappointing end. Curiosity forces you to read it just because of the ending in Pandemonium; however, you still get no answers. I honestly wouldn't have wasted my time and money if I would have known the ending would have been this disappointing.
B005LAIHXQ|3.0|At least we now know where those nasty little buggers came from. Now all we need to know is why.
B0097GVJWQ|4.0|Other than constantly going back &amp; forth between the same scenes with no purpose, I really enjoyed this game. The hidden objects are incredible. I really liked the sound effects &amp; narration. I will be purchasing the 2nd one &amp;hope I won't be disappointed. I would have given 5 stars except for the useless travel between scenes. I thank the developer for the awesome hint button because I would have been lost &amp; frustrated.
B007REV4T8|3.0|Not quite as exciting as the previous two but reasonable.Bond is about action intrigue and of course romance.Daniel Craig looked very tired and bored.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|this is an awesome app I luv it! The horses an it look sooo real! I love this game! Never blurry always has you progress saved and never loses it!!! I love this game soo much! It is great and is awesome!!!
B005LAIIPS|2.0|Nowhere near as good as the first three. If they are going to use (The Bourne) as part of the name of the movie they need to do better than that.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|I give it 5 stars because it was more difficult hidden picture game I played then the last one I played.
B009YQJ322|2.0|Considering the year and the technology at the time the original judge Dredd with Sly Stalone was a hundred percent better. I expected more from this version.
B003Q6D2B4|4.0|It was pretty much what I expected, therefore I'm good to go with this flick. If you're for a twisted in depth plot, this is not the flick, but if you're just looking for entertainment, this works.
B008JFUUIA|4.0|Well, okay, it is a chick flick, but my husband enjoyed it too.  The plot was a little silly, but the movie was cute and entertaining.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|One of the best series I've seen in a long time!  I would highly recommend this.  We got behind and had to play &#34;catch up.&#34;  It was tempting to watch the entire season in one sitting.  It is so good, though, we wanted to make it last as long as possible.
B00177YA1K|4.0|Like Men in Black 11, I also like this the first in the trilogy.  The characters, creatures and special effects.<br />My kind of movie.
B005DC68NI|5.0|This is a very useful book if you are interested in getting published. It goes through the reasons why it's difficult to get into print, and then why it's straightforward to get published electronically. I found the nitty-gritty about royalties fascinating and the book makes it pretty obvious that even if you are able to get published in the print media, you're likely to do better financially if you self-publish, assuming your stuff is worth reading. The book also contains a wealth of advice on how to proceed, which is great because the idea of doing this is pretty daunting. My only knock is that I thought that the testimonial chapters went on a bit longer than necessary; by then I was convinced and they didn't add a whole lot.
B00006JK1R|4.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I really like Tommy Lee Jones and Will Smith-they make a good team.  And I like all of the amazing creatures and special effects.
B000HC2LI0|5.0|I purchased this collection because my husband and I enjoyed the West Wing when it was on television.  It arrived on time and in good conditionl
B009KEN87O|5.0|Lots of time wasting fun.  Reminds me of hours spent zapping space invaders.  Some levels could load a bit faster.<br /><br />Still great.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The initial start of the book was a bit confusing.  It took me quite awhile before I became interested. It was good after I continued
B009KEN87O|5.0|Nice old school game. Has a Space Invaders feel with a new school touch. Love the game simple graphics but effective. If you gee up on Atari or even PlayStation its a winner.
B0049J2CKE|5.0|If you consider success in your chosen field as riches, then you will enjoy this story of two wanna be chefs (a rat and a sous chef), who turn out to be geniuses in the kitchen.  They overcome obstacles in their own way, to the enjoyment of all watching.When the local food critic shows at the restaurant, Our duo whip through their recipes and come up with a dish of the common man to appease the man who will make or break them.
B008OOYALE|3.0|It works great on Kindle and I like it. But the cost of some of the food and brush removel is way to much. I am not paying real money but the money you get in game. $150000 for one tree to be removed . Not to say the cost of food is a bit overpriced for the small amount you get. I give it 3 stars for that but its all good and fun to play.
B005PK1G76|4.0|Works with the City Micro baby jogger and much cheaper than the one Baby Jogger sells! Straps are completely covered with velcro so very adjustable.
B005CRQ2DK|5.0|That was an amazing book . I loved the when the creepy doll showed up. You should read this book, it's great!
B009AMANH4|4.0|Instead of giving us the expanse of Abraham Lincoln's life (which could arguably fill several films), we get here a small slice: the passage of the 13th amendment, outlawing slavery.  This is a smart movie: it gives director Steven Spielberg a focus (which he sorely needs), and keeps the film from meandering all over the place.<br /><br />LINCOLN is truly an actor's piece.  In the lead role, Daniel Day-Lewis is predictably flawless; his rendition of Lincoln is so thorough, the immediate effect is a little underwhelming; it's only after the screen goes dark that you realize you've witnessed such an amazing transformation/performance.  More immediately enjoyable are some of the supporting roles, particularly Tommy Lee Jones as the outspoken Thaddeus Stevens; Sally Field, as Lincoln's troubled spouse; David Straitharn as Lincoln's contentious Secretary of State William Seward; David Costabile, as one of Lincoln's groundlings; Jackie Earle Healey as Confederate VP Alexander Stephens; and Jared Harris as a simmering Ulysses S. Grant.  We also get, in less fleshed-out roles (the script doesn't give them much to do, unfortunately), a who's who of character actors: Joseph Gordon-Levitt; Hal Holbrook; James Spader; Bruce McGill; Tim Blake Nelson; John Hawkes; and others.  The supporting cast flits in and out; most of the performances are believable and top-notch, even when the script falters.<br /><br />And falter it does.  Tony Kershner has written a good script; the only problem is, it's not as impressive at its real-life subject matter.  Everything Lincoln says seems weighted with meaning; Day-Lewis understands what Lincoln was going for--a story or joke to lighten the mood, even if it has the opposite effect--but Spielberg and Kershner want every word this president says to mean something important.  The effect is didactic and off-putting; where we and the cast simply want the story to be about the characters, it suddenly becomes and morality.  We get it: this was an important time in American history.  There can be no disputing that.  But the audience is well aware of the importance; the film's true goal should've been--and, in a few spots, is--the characters involved in that moment.  Day-Lewis anchors the film with his heartfelt portrayal; but if LINCOLN had eschewed politics and focused a tad more on character, this could've been a 5-star movie, easily.  As is, you should definitely watch it; but you might not enjoy it as much as you would have otherwise.ortant time in American history.  There can be no disputing that.

B009UX2YAC|4.0|i dont like this game very much, i dont see the point unless you your bored but My sister and boyfriend crazy over this game.
0321356683|5.0|A great book indeed.  A \\"must read\\" for anyone interested in serious programming with Java.  Bloch has a way with words that developers rarely possess.  His explanations are fun to read and, once you have understood them, difficult to forget.
B0053TMP24|4.0|I rally liked reading The Son of Neptune.  I could tell that Riordon really put some effort into this book.  I did not enjoy it as much as The Last Olympian though but it looks as if it will shape out into a good series.  It is very funny too.
B003WKOU0G|5.0|This is such a charming documentary.  There are no words, just 4 babies and their families over the course of a year.  I love watching the ways in which we are the same, no matter where we live or what we possess.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I really like this game because its similar to Temple Run, but easier to play. For instance, you can play Subway Surfers in the car or on the go. It also works really well for bigger electronics (such as kindle fires). Also, it has daily challenges, new additions, and unique things (like the World Tour) that make it stand apart from other games in the market.<br />So overall, 4 stars!
B005S9EK5Y|2.0|If you are merely looking for a musical and haven't seen the play or movie before, then you are me and my  greatest complaint is that almost every line (ok, maybe 99.9%) is sung, and this serves to elongate every scene. The movie becomes very long. I have seen and enjoyed musicals like My Fair Lady and The Sound of Music; the ordinary conversations are spoken and the songs are sung.  In LM, you don't know when any song begin and you won't remember any of their words. I don't. No connoisseur, I won't complain about Russell Crowe's voice, but even I could tell there were better singers. In RC's defense, I admire his bravery in tackling this role.<br /><br />I haven't read the book, but I'd say the whole french revolution could have been cut in favor of focusing on the relationship been the one protagonist, his 'adopted' child and his enemy.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|this app rocks I use it Everett day for school you should get it now plus on the app description it dose everything it says :) ;)
B00AIBZM40|3.0|Producer Guillermo del Toro and director Andres Muschietti present Mama, a fairly regurgitated haunted tale of a spirit existing for no other reason than to reunite with a loved one.  Throw in a little Nell-flavor, with two young girls (1y/o & 3y/o) discovered five years after being abandoned in a woodland cottage, and the result produces two primitive little girls who shuffle around on all fours like animals and appear to survive primarily on cherries.<br /><br />What I did appreciate about Mama is the display.  Not only are the scenes and sets spooky, but the actual Mama character is exposed early enough into the film to conjure image when floor boards creak.  Even if she did sort of look like a CG version of the central character from Munch's \\"Scream.\\"  Adding a heaping does of uneasiness are the two little girls themselves.  Neither will be invited to neighborhood birthday parties any time soon.  The casting is done pretty well, and all actors held their screentime powerfully.  Ultimately, however, there is nearly nothing new, and the ending is as predictable as the Farmer's Almanac.  What isn't completely predictable is the ending.  Yeah, about that.  It's a horribly mixed message leaving the ending easily the worst part of the film.  Regardless of how it's examined, Mama makes a decision that leaves viewers unsatisfied.  Finishing either with a positive or negative spin is fine; it's all director flavor, but going \\"half-way\\" is just palatable.  If the custody battle over the feral children was a headache before this movie's ending...well, I imagine the next judge might start off with, \\"Lucy, you got some `splainin' to do.\\"<br /><br />Not good, not bad, nothing really new.  Worth a rental.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|ok so I got this app and I have had this for 2 years now and I love it this is perfect. this app is amazing and u get so much bang for ur buck. everyone that said one star grow up get a life this is a great app get it! get it! it is amazing!
B008D36INE|4.0|\\"The Deep Blue Sea\\" is a tale of adultery from almost the same provenance and time period as the classic \\"Brief Encounter\\" by David Lean. In fact, \\"Sea\\" is almost what \\"Encounter\\" might have been had it been drained of much of its romance, joy and passion. For while, in spite of their obvious misgivings, the couple in \\"Encounter\\" clearly enjoyed being in one another's company, the same can not necessarily be said of the lovers here, who seem to share very few moments of genuine joy and happiness throughout the course of their relationship.<br /><br />The 1952 Terrance Rattigan play focuses on Hester Collyer (Rachel Weisz), the young, attractive wife of an elderly judge (Simon Russell Beale) who falls in love with Freddie Page (Tom Hiddleston), an ex-RAF pilot, in post-WW II London. In a bold move for the time, Hester leaves her husband and moves into a flat with Freddie, but we know immediately that things are not going well, for, as the movie opens, we find Hester attempting suicide, with much of the rest of the story exploring, through a combination of contemporary and flashback scenes, how she's reached this low point of desperation.<br /><br />One of the key elements of the Rattigan play is that it is scrupulously fair to all its characters. The author has no interest in casting stones at any of the people involved in the situation, for each is shown to be a fully-realized human being, with all the virtues and flaws that come along with that status. The emotions and relationships remain multi- layered, ambiguous and complex, and writer/director Terence Davies' spare, almost claustrophobic style perfectly captures the airless, dimly lit world these characters inhabit - something akin to a tableau vivant depiction of frustration and unhappiness.<br /><br />As the woman caught between natural lust, a desire for freedom, and the stiff-upper-lipped propriety of the society around her, Rachel Weiscz delivers a thoughtful, moving performance, and she is matched every step of the way by a superb supporting cast.<br /><br />Despite the often drastic changes in social mores that have occurred since the time of the story, \\"The Deep Blue Sea,\\" with its keen insights into the nature of the human heart, remains universal and relevant to today.tep of the way by a superb supporting cast.<br /><br />Despite the often drastic changes in social mores that have occurred since the time of the story, \\"The Deep Blue Sea,\\" with its keen insights into the nature of the human heart, remains universal and relevant to today.
B008XG1X18|5.0|Have gotten so many great ideas off of this site. I have it downloaded on my computer, and on my Kindle
B008WCP2PG|5.0|I really liked this one. It won't win any Oscars for plot, but it was still a great movie, and their was some humor. The dancing was FANTASTIC and made me want to take Channing Tatum or Joe Maganiello home with me. Sigh. I guess I'll have to settle for the dvd.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|I don't enjoy this game, but the Grandkids Love playing it. Guess it is a good game to have on my Kindle
B009IEXKXI|5.0|Great read, Very detailed. Very real main character. I had a hard time putting it down. Bougth it just because it popped up and has mega reviews. A few typos, which usualy drive me nuts, but considering the excellent story, i ignored them.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|LOVED the books. I even bought the Movie when it came out. Was a book I couldn't put down. Had to keep reading them to see what happened next.

B008XG1X18|5.0|One of my favorite apps! Does everything I want it to and more. I love Pinterest and the app on my Kindle brings hours of enjoyment wherever I go. Much easier to see than my phone and when there's no Wi-Fi available I use my phone as a &#34;Hot Spot&#34;. Easy to use and easy to understand.
B00005JKNF|4.0|This is one of those great British Edwardian tales.  My only issue is that the dialogue is difficult to understand.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Beautiful, durable, well made! Absolutely no complaints! The leather is so smooth, true red color and the design is very chic. Straps hold very well and have not loosened at all. Would definitely purchase again!
B005C8ENI0|4.0|I was very surprised at the quality of the plot, acting. It was a lot better than expected.<br />Would recommend it as a&#34;watch&#34;
B009KEN87O|4.0|This game is a great shooter.  Power ups well timed.  And unique features like going into a 3d view. Keep up the good work.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Could not put it down, excited to read what happens next. I thought the first one was good, the second one is even better
030758836X|2.0|Not sure how it got such a high rating, but this book was just ok. Until the last few chapters. Then it was horrible. What a lousy ending.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|No book ever moved me the way this one did. If you served or love your country you will do as I and buy multiple copies to give to others to read and pass on. Gain perspective and insight into an absolutely unbelievable story or heartache and triumph. If it wasn't a true story, it would be foolish to print. Thank you, Marcus for sharing this with the world. There is a reason for all things.
B0041KBWM0|5.0|I know everyone likes the Gwyneth Paltrow movie, but this was more in depth and the characters fun to watch.<br />The heroine and hero were well matched and made a believable pair.<br />I can watch this over and over whereas I can't say that for the other Emma.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This was a definite page turner!!! I will definitely recommend this to all of the women I know, great story,
B004J4WLB4|5.0|The twists and turns in this book kept me up reading late in the night! Great storytelling and easy to follow prose.
030758836X|3.0|A more or less believable relationship is developed in the first half of Girl Gone, after which the reader is given a vaguely believable abduction and manipulation story. After a slow beginning, the novel reaches an exciting middle before slumping again to reach a less convincing ending. Nick and Amy have had an intense relationship and marriage in New York, but things begin to go downhill as they both lose their jobs and return to Nick's Mississippi home town. Then one day, on their anniversary, Amy disappears. Has Nick disposed of her, or is he being set up? The problem is that one of the protagonists does something not entirely believable at a key turning point in the plot. The character follows the needs of the plot rather than the other way around, breaking a cardinal rule of writing. Altogether, I found this full of promise but ultimately disappointing.
B00BEPVAV8|5.0|this game is great I love how you can switch your controls. I also love they give you mission to try and beat. Then you earn coins to upgrade your car and get power ups. You also can get dropships and extra lives.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I will be unloading this as I can't figure out how to change the settings so my grandkids can't &#34;BUY&#34; gems without my knowledge.  It's not very user friendly, in that respect....even after googling it!

B0015AARJI|4.0|My wife and I have our computers in an office, which is adjacent to the living room with TV and couch.  My wife wanted to play some computer games on the tv.  Being the awesome husband that I am, I have connected her computer to the tv via a super long hdmi cable and adapter (see other reviews).  But, there was no way that a wireless xbox or usb controller would work in this set up.  It's too far for the reception, plus walls.  I was talking to my brother and he told me how he was able to remotely set up his PS3 and the bluetooth controller works through the walls up to like 40 feet.<br /><br />Long review short, the PS3 controller does work with the bluetooth computer just fine.  My wife has an imac and it works fine natively in the apple os with some quick changes.  For the PC, you need to get an extra usb bluetooth adapter because windows doesn't recognize the bluetooth hardware.  So, 4 stars for the controller only because it is a pain to hook up to our imac hardware via the windows feature.<br /><br />I realize none of this situation is the controller's fault, or Sony's.  The controller works just fine once you get it set up.  Some people may want to use it for a Mac or PC, though, and that process is included in the review of the product.
B009KEN87O|5.0|This app is a good simple shooter.  There are some new twists on the old space invaders theme.  Worth a download as a FAOTD.

032147404X|3.0|I recommend this book for beginners. I like very useful hints (except that high resolution gives flexibility for cropping, is valuable), I like Scott’s passion for photography.<br />This book is not enough for those wanting to be good photographers, although enough for amateurs to pretend pros. Next to this book I bought another (the same price + free delivery) which contains much more advices, much more examples, describes technology, compares equipment and software. It also answers for the question “WHY” related to the Scott’s hints.  The only disadvantage – it is 5 times heavier, not for travelling. For Australians, who do not want to be ripped-off by Adobe, I suggest to consider Corel’s PaintShop Pro or any other software than Photoshop
0547848412|4.0|A young writer has a chance meeting with an elderly man in a coffee shop who promises that the story he is about to tell him will make him believe in God. With pen and paper ready, the writer listens to the fantastic tale of our protagonist, Piscene Patel or Pi as he is called, who may or may not be the old man who is telling the tale. This is never explained. \\"'Life of Pi' is told from two points of view, the main character Pi in the flashback and Yann Martel himself, who is the \\"visiting writer\\".<br /><br />In the first part, Pi, now an adult reflects on his life and the extraordinary adventure of being lost at sea in a lifeboat for 227 days with a hyena, a zebra, and orangutan, and a large Bengal tiger, named Richard Parker, all in the boat with him. Pi is a good-natured 16 year old boy who does well in school and is religiously inclined to practice or share interest in three religions, Hindu, Muslim and Christian. He has a curious mind. He tells his father, a zoologist in India, that he wants to be baptized as well as obtain a prayer rug so he can pray outside. At the zoo Pi is awakened each morning by the roar of the lions and he learns how humans and animals coexist within the barriers of the place. This particular knowledge proves useful to say the least as the story unfolds.<br /><br />Pi's family decides they have had enough of India and they emigrate to Canada, taking all the animals with them on a ship. There is a terrible storm and the ship sinks, leaving Pi as the only human survivor, stranded at sea with the aforementioned animal companions.<br />The second part of the novel from page 97 to 286 is the bulk of the book and the story takes place in the middle of the Pacific Ocean. Once out there, the zebra, hyena, and orangutan are killed off rather quickly, leaving only Pi and the Bengal tiger on the boat. Their relationship dominates the story from this point on.<br /><br />Pi survives each day at sea with endurance and determination through the routine he has established for himself; saving food, avoiding sharks, suffering through storms, and the painful boils on his body. Everything is realistically portrayed; as well as his emotions, which range from terror, loneliness, sadness, despair and hope. The experience he relates is nothing less than fascinating. The other more important aspect of this book is the bond he has with his only companion, Richard Parker, the tiger. He knows the tiger can kill him at any moment, so he constructs a flotilla of sorts that he attaches to the boat so he can be safely away from the tiger yet close to him at the same time.<br />It's a tall tale, nevertheless engrossing. There is pain and suffering that is graphically described. For example, when the hyena is hungry and cannot cope with the confined space, he begins to attack the zebra and eat it alive. The zebra doesn't die until a few days later.<br /><br />There are some uncomfortable passages when there is no food left and Pi is forced to eat the tiger's feces. The hyena also does away with the orangutan and the hyena is killed by the tiger. The deaths of these animals are heavy and dense in the literature. They are dark points that haunt the rest of the story. The vivid and shocking description of the hyena's consumption of the zebra, and beheading of the orangutan help to communicate just how desperate the situation is; the decay of the dead animals onboard the ship; Pi's dispirited killing of various sea turtles, and the consumption of their blood. Nothing is left out here.<br /><br />It is an impressive accomplishment for a writer to devote so many pages in what is essentially a limited setting but with endless occurrences that are richly and sometimes disturbingly described. After reaching page 200, I wanted the story to end. Perhaps that is due to my own impatience. I enjoy stories that are long in narrative, but I must confess after page 200, I wanted the main characters to reach land.<br /><br />I did not find God represented much in the book. But I suspect the world in this story is a symbolic expression of a deeper meaning through a tale acted out by humans, animals, and in this case, even plant life. Yann Martel has crafted a magnificent tale involving a love of animals, nature, religion, and let's not forget the multitude of ocean survival skills all designed to explore what faith in a Supreme Being means. God is evoked in the surroundings. In other words, how could the world exist if there was not a designer to it all?<br /><br />The meaning of having an island with flesh eating algae near the end of the book could be many things. For me, it is a way to understand and interpret the world around us, which is both good and evil.<br /><br />Review by Charles Blanchard<br />[...]esented much in the book.

B007SGLZP8|5.0|This was another great book by Grisham. It was unpredictable and I didn't want to put it down. I enjoyed the constant suspense and how everything would tie together.
B009K0P10K|5.0|I can't get enough of this show!!! There are so many twists and turns, just when you think you have it figured out something else happens.
B003LQMZS0|5.0|I was looking for a toy to put on my then 3m old son's carseat, and I bought this item because of the great reviews. I wasn't dissapointed. My now 4m old LOVES it! Keeps him entertained for a long time. Currently his favorite leg is the one with the two beads on it.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|Another good episode of one of my favorite TV shows.  One can always count on the interesting characters and story lines.
B008M0NDOK|5.0|Finally a game controller for the Ipad.  Seems to work great, design is a little hard to get used to, but will work.,  Hopefully more games will be coming soon.
B001XUPGLY|4.0|Was not a Star Trek fan back in the day, but was encouraged to watch this movie by friends -- I was surprised that I really did like it.
0307744434|3.0|I received this book in a giveaway on Goodreads.<br /><br />When I first started reading this book, I had no idea where the story was going.  The synopsis on the back cover is a little misleading.  There is nothing explicitly \\"thrilling\\" going on in this book.  It's a very slow battle of wills with a confusing love connection.<br /><br />The main characters are rather flat, which makes their \\"love story\\" rather flat.  The side characters are more in depth, which made it bearable to read.  I have to admit that the biggest driving point for finishing the book was trying to figure out what the contest was in the first place.<br /><br />Even after I completed it, I'm a little disappointed in what the contest's desired outcome is.  It was definitely nothing fantastical as the rest of the book built it up to be.<br /><br />I did get swept up in the story and felt compelled to read what happened next.  The book was a magical page turner for me.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|some shows are downers, of course, but all in all a great show! excellent choices for the characters as well.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have had this app for over a year and I refer to it always and have never had a problem loading or otherwise. I am very happy with AccuWeather.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|it's a bit of a downer sometimes, but thats the way it is. costuming  is excellent for the time period
B00BP4WAZS|2.0|This movie was not very good.  Very childlike boring for adults.  children under 5 sure they would love it, but anyone any older I wouldnt recommend wasting their time or money
1588167461|3.0|This is a decent style guide that I might recommend to someone who has no clue about how to dress well, or what constitutes a good wardrobe. It's a starting point, with some helpful information on shirts, suits, pants, shoes, coats, accessories, personal grooming, and tips on wardrobe maintenance, packing a suitcase, and so on. For someone with a moderate budget who needs to build a wardrobe from the ground up, the checklist type approach in the Esquire handbook could work well. The book is a convenient size, and it wouldn't be a bad idea to bring it with you on your next shopping trip.<br /><br />That said, it's not a very good resource for someone who already has a working knowledge of menswear and who wants more detailed information, and there are some other issues worth mentioning. There are no color photographs, which should be a priority when color is so important to many of the parts of a wardrobe. Illustrations and photos are used interchangeably, but a few of the illustrations would work better as photos.<br /><br />Some important things are glossed over or skipped entirely. In the shoe chapter, there is virtually no information on shoe construction. There are many different ways to make and identify a good shoe (and a bad one), but you wouldn't know it from this book. There is a two-sentence definition of goodyear welts, and that's about it. For garments, there is almost no information about fabrics, fabric weights, weaves or patterns. You'll know lots of cute little trivia about what kind of collars wall street bankers like to wear, but like the shoe chapter, you'll be left ignorant about what defines a well-made shirt. There are five pages dedicated to watches, but the book is very light on substantive information. It's great to know what watch Chow Yun Fat wore in The Corruptor, and that Al Gore's digital Timex projects a stately and professional image (!?), it really is. But all you learn from this book is that Omega watches are sweet, you can match watches with cufflinks, and mechanical watches are more expensive than quartz. Great. For a man investing money in a wardrobe, the watch is likely to be the most expensive thing he wears, and the most costly to maintain. There should have been at least five more pages on the subject.<br /><br />There are two things in this book that stand out as extremely goofy. Out of left field, Donald Trump is showered with praise in two different chapters for his impeccable style, power, and unparalleled business acumen. From page 173: \\"the tycoon has never lacked the courage of his convictions. His hairstyle is no exception. It's an assertion of control and an expression of his approach to business...nothing is left to chance.\\" I hope the huge check Esquire got for this shameless fellatio-in-print didn't bounce. But I'm probably being unfair. I'm sure Esquire must be referring to a different Donald Trump. The Donald Trump I know of went bankrupt over and over and over again, has a hairpiece that's been an object of ridicule all around the world for 25 years, and now makes a living by ranting about the president's birth certificate and putting his name on awful $15 \\"executive\\" dress shirts made in China that not even Ross and Burlington Coat Factory can sell.<br /><br />Almost as goofy as the ankle-grabbing Trump love is a diagram on one page telling men to never, ever wear a necktie or cufflinks with jeans.....and on the VERY NEXT PAGE Jay Z is exalted for wearing a necktie and cufflinks with some baggy jeans, or as they say, \\"faultlessly blending Savile Row swank with sly street funk.\\" Grampa, is that you? Who on God's sweet green Earth says \\"sly street funk\\"? Speaking of grandparents, this book is surprisingly out of date. About 60% of the men featured in the photos have been dead for decades. It's nice to see some timeless styles, but come on now.<br /><br />This book is more style than substance (har har), and the authors get more caught up in brand names and cute little lists of \\"wardrobe essentials\\" (all of which can be found at your nearest Macy's ;D ) than informing readers well. It's not an accident that if you flip through any random issue of Esquire or GQ, you'll find ads for every single type of product mentioned in this book. Every single one. You might say the book is an advertisement for other advertisements. But considering the price, portability, and the breadth of information, it's not a bad introduction to style. Just be sure to use the book only as a starting point.<br /><br />And one more thing. The front cover label of my book was glued on upside down. Nice one, guys. Nice one.
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|Cute movie.  It was a little scary for my 3 year old but still really cute.  Would watch again. :)

B00AHTYGRW|5.0|Really nothing to stay but it is required if you rate it a 5 star which is stupid, why can't you just like a product and have nothing else to say?
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|A great reminder of what is important in life and not to get 'sucked in' on the so-called standards and values that others and society have taught us to believe.  You only have control of your own thoughts, feelings and actions and to allow views made by others due to their beliefs or insecurity only robs you of your own happiness, if you allow it.  Be true to your heart regardless of 'popular' opinion.  It is YOUR life to live - no one elses.
B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This film is not about survival.  This film is not about fighting wolves.  This film is not even about brotherhood.  This film is about LIVING and what it means to be alive.  It celebrates the act of living, even if we have to die to do it.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I seriously can't get enough of this CD. If you love JT's music...you will have to buy this. And listen to it. Nonstop.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|If you're a fan you're a fan, if you're not you're not. That's really all there is to say. The visuals are stunning, the score is beautiful and haunting. If you liked LOTR you'll like this.
B0097GVJWQ|5.0|I really like the combination of mystery, puzzles, and hidden objects.  The graphics are awesome.  It is well worth the money!
B00633W614|5.0|I chose five stars because. Once you read \\"the sins of the father\\" you will understand my decision, just hope I will be able to find that the book has been written and is available.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|e x c e l l e n t !!!<br />On time, perfect package<br />e x c e l l e n t !!!
B004IHE2B4|5.0|My grandson loves legos and trains.  He absolutely loved this additional stuff to add to his collection.  If I made him happy, that is all that matters.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Got turned into this book by my 14 year old daughter. Absolutely love it. I felt like a kid again and empathized w his struggles. Read this w your teenager
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|This was a great family movie.  There are some intense moments, so you may not want to show it to kids &#60; 5 years.  Has a good, feel-good story line that gives it meaning.
0449911357|5.0|I chose this rating because this book make me laugh, cry, smile, be happy and really brightend up my day while reading it. the book and the movie are simular. with the book you get an even deeper look at the story and the people and let me tell you they are addictive. Ninny is my favright and I read everything in her voice from the movie. What a great story. My favright book at the moment.
B009UZBLSG|5.0|fast and works great with the nexus 4.<br /> there's even a port for charging your phone while using it which I think is amazing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This book is terrible. The girl is stupid to put up with such treatment. I do not know how there could be 2 more books, what else can he do to her?
B000VZYPB4|5.0|No reason not to like the show.  The writing is excellent and there is a diverse range of characters, keeping it from becoming monotonous.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|The best calculator ever!!! easy to download, super easy to read and use!!! I use this every day at home and at work i no longer need my adding machine!!!!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I go through a ton of e-books, usually just using the star ratings that pop up at the end to review. After reading Wool, I felt like I just had to put into words how great I thought this was. Recommended to me by my sister, but since we have such different tastes I wasn't expecting much. She even offered to loan me her copy but after reading an article in the Wall Street Journal about the author, I felt like I just wanted to purchase my own copy. I'm glad I did because I'm sure I will be revisiting this novel sometime again.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|I have nothing bad to say about this series. I am hooked!! The acting is fantastic, the plot better. Highly recommend , but definitely would not let kids 14 under watch. Really graphic!!
B009HNDCC4|5.0|Phil kills me. The awkwardness between him and Matthew Broderick had me holding my breath the whole time waiting to see what Phil would say next.
B00BLCHYKU|5.0|We needed a good Viking show. I like this due to the fact there isn't a lot of Spartacus porn, like the other series. Enough is enough with that crap. I can tell when I really like a show because I am bummed out when the episode is over and I have to Wait a week for the  next one. I highly recommend this series.
B009K0P10K|5.0|Revenge is one of the best shows I have ever witnessed. It truly is addicting and super interesting and compelling! It's got everything: romance, action, scheming, and plenty of REVENGE. I absolutely love it!
B004SIIBGU|5.0|So much easier than the full site. Makes shopping from work a breeze. I'm at work so much it makes my life easier!
1451695195|3.0|I found the title very off-putting, so much so that this harrowing tale of a health care professional's entering coma and recovering consciousness was somewhat invalidated. The evidence of an external, objective \\"heaven\\", accessible to all, could no more be proven by one person's ICU stay than if he were musing about life's great questions a la Dr.William James, at his own desk.<br />Much has been made about his being a neurosurgeon in the sense that his observations about consciousness and brain physiology are the epitome of insight. However, a<br />neurologist or neuro-physiologist would have more useful things to say about his levels of coma and experiences of awareness. To that end, Drs. Oliver Sacks and Martin Samuels \\"were not impressed\\".<br />I would have been interested in how E.Coli got in his meninges. Urological or gastrointestinal infection seeding the blood then the brain? His infectious disease colleague was lukewarm in his jacket comment.<br />I don't doubt that all this was very real to Eben Alexander. Whether it holds<br />any general truths for the rest of us is debatable. The fact that he is a neurosurgeon may explain why he thinks it should be accepted as \\"proof\\".
B009KEN87O|5.0|I was skeptical at first, but decided to give it a try based on the other reviews I read. I'm glad I did!  Don't be put off by the classic arcade graphics, this game is an awesome little time waster! :)
B009FBX5M0|3.0|The sound tracks were really good quality.Disapointed that Adele was not on album singing the title song Skyfall.This was disapointing and the reason I gave it three stars.I would imagine other people complained about this also.
B00APUQRPC|5.0|One of the best baseball movies I have ever seen. On top of that though, about more than just baseball. Excellent excellent movie.
B0021L8V1Q|5.0|Great follow up to the first, lots of action! Fun to watch over and over again. One of my favorites!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|Movie was great. Had humor for adults and a storyline for the whole family. Another Disney Classic in Wreck it Ralph
B00198X0VS|5.0|We were waiting for this to come out, what a classic fun movie! Of course they kick butt and save the world again, and who doesn't want to watch that!
B009AP2G26|4.0|Love this series good music and good drama!!! More time could be spent at the school actually and not on the graduates but that Rachel is a great singer!1
B001TH16DI|5.0|These are a favorite, I grew up with Star Trek, my parents watched all the time. My favorite is #4 w/ the whales. I love me some whales! But they are all great!
B00006CXSS|5.0|I owned this box set once before and it went missing. I ordered it from Amazon and had great success in getting quick. The price was right and the delivery was fast and on time. Watched the whole set in a day and a half. Going to order more movies soon.
B00AYR2FOI|3.0|Maybe after I listen a few more times this CD will grow on me, but my initial impression is that he was just going through the motions. Boz forgive me. BTW, it took way too long to receive my CD after the order. VERY slow delivery.
B009H7SCMA|5.0|A bawdy, satirical tale of class warfare and cricket. I don't know the first thing about cricket, but I do know that I have never encountered a character quite like Gabriella and probably never will again.  I both loved and hated her and will never forget her. The story is filled with shameless characters you will swear you'd never want to meet but secretly want to. That fact along with the author's biting wit make this book well worth a read. You will laugh, gasp, wrinkle your nose in disgust and cheer for the upper and lower classes by turn. Buy this book, sit back in your favorite chair with your favorite drink and learn a thing or two about Cricket.  Who knew it could be such erotic fun?
B005WUHAX8|5.0|This case was slim, protected my phone against scratches, bumps, water damage and dust. I like the design and that us not bulky like some other cases.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Super fun game... I used to dominate space invaders and this brings me back to the good old days.  You will enjoy it... Especially for free!
B005P5TQPU|5.0|My husband and I have been watching it since it became available on CW21  Monday  thru Friday.  I  DVR it and watch without commercials,  We like to watch Sam and Dean kill monsters!<br /><br />The only downside is the secondary audio.<br /><br />I'm looking for 'Born Again Identity' episode.
B000JCCNPE|5.0|A delicious send up of political correctness, the media, big corporations, special interest groups, politicians and just about every aspect of American culture. Despite the fact that the movie pokes fun at everyone and everything, it is not mean spirited; it is a smart, dark comedy that will leave you thinking.<br /><br />This 2005 movie is based on a 1994 novel by Christopher Buckley (William F. Buckley, Jr.'s son). It stars Aaron Eckhart who shines as Nick Naylor a lobbyist for Big Tobacco.  Nick's preternatural gifts for spin control, misdirection and obfuscation, coupled with a flexible moral compass, make him especially good at his job. You watch him navigate an interview on day time television, assorted press conferences, a divorce, a reconciliation with his son, a delightfully steamy affair with a reporter (Heather Holloway, played by Katie Holmes), a violent anti-smoking terrorist group, and his own conscience. I am not sure how you are supposed to feel about Nick. I found myself rooting for him, but uncomfortable with him: the kind of complex emotional response engendered by only the best movies. Definitely worth seeing.
B009I2UH2W|5.0|Works great with the iPhone5.  Its a really tight fit in the car charger so once I got it in I haven't taken it out but it worked fine.
B0095NCXKI|1.0|This is the lamest scenario anyone could come up with, and who in the world would employ as a waitress (who is the most out front person in a restaurant) these two who have no idea about work or concern for their jobs. It's just stupid.
B0042TV4IW|4.0|This is an entertaining series. It gives insights into small hamlet & village living & wealth vs. poor in early England...the classes & attitudes.<br /><br />The cast is excellent and after the initial introduction to all the characters, each episode seems to focus on a character or set of characters trying to work out a problem. Sometimes the outcomes of some of the episodes leaves one wondering why the problems resolved the way the writers chose to resolve them. Fairness isn't always part of the picture.  Some of the characters are shown as quite despicable, but then will show a kinder, more human side.  The one issue I had was that there was no follow-up to some of the characters that had problems & lived within the towns.  They are shown to be an integral part of the town (such as the shoemaker & his son) but their characters disappear after an episode is based on their issues.<br /><br />It definitely has a liberal slant...too bad that...<br />The religious are made to look like zealots. The poor spend money as fast as they get/or might get it without putting anything aside.<br /><br />Some of the episodes are a bit tedious...dwelling far too long on the particular problem being addressed, but overall, it is quite entertaining!
B0000DJZA5|3.0|besides missing a song from the original album...most tracks lack the product of the orginial songs. but other than that its okay.
B008YKGQR4|5.0|I just got this app about a week or so ago....So far...Its been Awesome!!<br />I've had NO problems at all....I totally recommend this app to anyone that uses FB!! You will not be disappointed!! It does 'everything' Facebook' is supposed to do....<br />You can Share...Play games...Search for friends...Download/Save photos...etc.<br />I just 'hope' after this newest 'update' everything is still as great as it is now...if it is...<br />I'll be 'HAPPY'...'HAPPY'...'HAPPY'!!!!<br />Oh yeah...AND...It's absolutely F-R-E-E!!!!

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love this series! It holds my interest and keeps me coming back for more! You won't be disappointed! 5 stars from me!
B002JH3TW8|5.0|What I needed to use the older external hard drives on my newer iMac. Does the trick, good cable, simple solution.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I quickly read the first book and couldn't wait to see what else was in store! It will keep your interest the whole way through!
B009KEN87O|5.0|iloveit i appreciatethe fact that this isfree. blah blah blah. download thisgame it is very fun to play. yes yes yes yes yes yes yes
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Started slowly, the two main characters die off.  I liked them and was sorry.  But it was necessary for the story.  The story is believable...unfortunately.  The ideas presented and the ideas that can, could, and will spin off from here are really the most exciting part of the novel.
B00A3AUGEW|5.0|I have watched many seasons of American Idol (my wife's fault), but I have never been inclined to buy any music from any of the winners or losers for that matter. I kept hearing this song on a commercial for Insurance, but I didn't know who sang it. When I found out it was Phil Phillips and it was the song &#34;Home&#34; that he sang on the finale, I was surprised. I didn't pursue it much beyond that, but I had received some MP3 credits for items I bought at Amazon and I was up against the deadline to use them. On a whim, I bought the Phil Phillips album and boy was I surprised. The album is full of energy and it is very easy to listen to the whole thing at one time which is very unusual for me. I like the drums, his voice sounds good, and the songs are catchy. It fits right in there with bands like Mumford and Sons.
B008JFUTUY|5.0|I choose this rating because the dvd was very moving and electric.  Actually, I love the man's energy and what he represents to all of us as a human being.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Reminds me of the old space invaders. Good game love that it has little power ups. Husband and kids alike love it.
B00005YW4H|5.0|I truly love this cd.  It is everything I like and more.  I would recommend this cd to anyone with an ear for excellent music.
B004HD61KE|5.0|A fun story with interesting places and characters. Nothing like a good conspiracy story at historic and native American sites.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very entertaining for a rainy day or for when your just bored. Love it so much. keeps me busy for a long time
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Kyle  was one in a  million.  If only he could have lived to see his children grow to have children.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|As soon as I saw the trailer I bought the book and I fell in love with it. Of course the movie was completely different from the book but the movie was still good. I loved it it was enjoyable and entertaining
B00BKTWBMA|1.0|I have always loved Eric Clapton. I've been a rabid fan since the Yardbirds but he has definitely lost it over the last decade or so. He hasn't done anything really good since the Unplugged album and this one tops them all for really bad. It is pathetic. Not only has he included songs that should never have even been written but he takes an iconic masterpiece like Gary Moore's 'Still Got the Blues' and does it like a bad lounge act. When I saw how he dresses at the Crossroads Festivals, I knew that he had quit caring and had lost the style that made him so cool to begin with. I have heard that he has been talking retirement lately. All I can say is, do it, Eric, retire before you destroy your legacy altogether.
B009KEN87O|5.0|At first this looks like one of those games that we've all played 1000 times. But there's a reason we have and this takes that classic arcade challenge and adds some fantastic new twists to its game play. The sound is excellent and like other reviewers I am happy to say this is modern retro done right.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|My children have been watching this series, much to my delight!  I was a Trekkie, now my young children love the program as well.  They look forward to watching.
B00A4FOWYQ|4.0|It almost has an 80's vibe to it.  I don't know why the 80's ate coming back to pop culture... Also the album is a little bit more poppy than edgy as other albums by T & S are.
B004AYCWZI|3.0|While it makes interesting reading overall it's a bit predictable not leaving much for the surprise element. Also  I found it slightly implausible in the juxtaposition of India and France as the two main subject matter whose styles of cuisine can't be anymore different and far apart ( even though I enjoy both types but not fusion ).
B003O86FMW|5.0|The book is very good I like it so much that I read after my bedtime I recommend reading this.
B00A85EMVK|3.0|Good movie, but definitely not a 3-D experience.  Understand that it was not originally shot in 3-D, so should have lowered my expectations.<br /><br />Delivery and price was great!
1616550414|5.0|This is a great book for any Zelda fan or newcomer to the series, so much detail went int it in very high quality. Once I got Hyrule Hystoria I couldn't stop reading I just got absorbed into it, making sure I didn't miss a single detail. This encyclopedia of the Zelda series definitely met my expectations, anyone interested in this product should definitely give it a go.
B005BCE7FQ|5.0|Bought this for the grandkids, however, I enjoyed it very much!  Cut story, good voices that fit characters.<br /><br />Good price and very fast delivery!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I was actually really sad that it was over when I finished it. Everyone should read this book. It's my new favorite.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|Excellent 3-D experience!  Enjoyed the story and was definitely on the edge of my seat through a lot of the movie.  Good price and very fast delivery!  Would recommend this one!
0060873027|2.0|Every other technological thriller written by Michael Crichton had a strong grounding in science.  Even though the situations were often fantastic, there was nothing in known science at the time of their writing that could prevent them from happening.<br /><br />Here, though, we have a book where the basic premise violates the law of conservation of mass/energy, along with quite a few other fairly undisputed principles of physics.  Isaac Asimov wrote several essays about how hard he worked to try to explain the shrinking of people when he was asked to write a novel based on the script for \\"Fantastic Voyage\\".  In the end, he realized that much of the process had to be hand-waved away because it was simply impossible.  If you can accept far more of that kind of hand-waving, then this book might be worth 4 stars to you, as it then becomes a somewhat interesting action/adventure/thriller.<br /><br />The biggest problem is not the mistakes (even with glaring ones like humans the size of ants wouldn't have the higher strength/weight ratio that ants have), but rather the selectivity of what is and is not altered when something is shrunk.  Hearing and speech are altered so that shrunken humans cannot speak with regular sized humans, while sight is normal, and smell is enhanced.  Bodily functions proceed essentially as normal and shrunken proteins and enzymes can interact with normal sized molecules.  Shrunken electronics run normally, and can communicate with normal sized devices.<br /><br />In addition, the whole premise of choosing to shrink people as one of the first uses of the device is silly.  If this technology really existed, the company that had it would start by shrinking things like computers (since they still work the same in the book's reality) and putting them on the market.  Instead, we have a company that has no actual products, yet is building incredibly complicated devices and shrinking them (along with people) in order to search the Hawaiian rain forest for new chemicals for pharmacological use.<br /><br />If you can borrow this book, or get it for a few dollars, it might be worth it, but don't waste your time otherwise.
B00B18OL78|5.0|Have enjoyed listening to it so  many times since I bought it. It makes me smile.  Well Well Well Well
B00BEZTMFY|1.0|This is unbelievable!  There is not one word in Amazon's ad for this DVD saying it is part one of three!  It says you are buying The Hobbit....and all you are getting is a bunch of hollywood nonsense that they call part one of three in very small print on the back cover of this DVD.  Stick with the animated version and you can't go wrong.  We will -never- buy anything else that has anything to do with this trash from WB!
B00B2V66VS|1.0|My son spend $27 in 20 minutes on this game.  Beware this game will take all of your money.  Terrible Game!
B00382S9SC|5.0|Perfect Condition. Great service. Awesome show! Enjoyed it back in the day. Was fun to re-live it. Will eventually buy the other remaining seasons.
1616550414|5.0|I purchased one copy of this book from amazon.com, I recieved it extremely quickly and in great packaging.<br />Opening the Historia to me was like a dream come true considering I've been quite literally a life long fan of Legend of Zelda and most of Shigeru Miyamoto's work. I was so please with this purchase I bought another to gift to a friend of mine that has just as much a passion for Legend of Zelda as I do.<br /><br />Thanks for making this available to us Mr. Shigeru Miyamoto and Amazon!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|The \\"young adult\\" category under which this book has been marketed does not do justice to its universal appeal.  All mature readers are likely to enjoy learning what this sassy narrator has to share about her deep insights.
B00B23O96A|5.0|I agree with the comment of David Smith. This is a super record of Clapton and his close pals enjoying and serving the music.  They are not playing these old and older classics to show off or impress you with their virtuosity, they are having a wonderful time serving the music.  These are terrific musicians putting the music on display and putting the composers first.  I LOVE IT!  Clapton ROCKS even when he doesn't rock.
B0092MEGI4|3.0|Spoiler alert. Some very half-baked writing that shows a lack of familiarity with the subject matter. A few examples: No hit man with any common sense would plan to kill a high profile politician in a crowded ballroom. Too many chances for things to go wrong, too many witnesses, etc. Then he shoots from 15 feet away ensuring that fatal shot would not be delivered. And what's this? A federal agent just happens to be standing nearby with his gun loaded and ready to kill the would-be assassin -- too convenient and defies belief.<br /><br />Jimmy Darmody's crew surprising Lansky and Luciano in the woods: Drop your guns! Sure. No problem, Darmody. Let me just surrender my weapon while you hold a gun in my face. We're talking about Lucky Luciano, one of the most notorious gangsters of all time. That's a lot of trust to place in a guy who tried to kill you a few episodes back. Doesn't stand up.<br /><br />The interminably long drama of the sanctimonious Margret Schroeder is too painful to watch. Her character is a bore and yet a good chunk of the show revolves around her.<br /><br />The worst thing I can say is that the overall story arc flounders between random events that appear to be added simply to spice up the script. (Let's have the ordinarily thoughtful Darmody throw somebody off a balcony, for no apparent reason). Random.<br /><br />Nucky's brother is another random mystery. Shrewd and clever or stupid and jealous? If so shrewd, how does he commit such blunders? If so stupid and full of contempt for Nucky, how did he get so far as his trusted ally? There's an air of implausibility that permeates much of the writing.<br /><br />Despite the flaws, I've watched 2 seasons. I like going back to the days of Prohibition. The costumes and sets are believable. I also like the historic representation of the famous hoodlums Rothstein, Lansky, Capone, and Luciano, even thought they are often besotted by bad writing...
0062014536|3.0|Well...it seems the end of this wonderful series is upon us; with sadly more fizzle than fire.  Lena, who had made so much progress in growth and self confidence in Pandemonium; seems to have completely reverted to her former dithering in this read.<br />She is so hopelessly torn by her feelings for both Julian and Alex that she takes no true action in the matter at all. (A la doe in headlights.)  Here is the point where readers throw the book across the room in frustration.<br />Julian is really likable.  At least the parts of him that we get to see.<br />Alex on the other hand...a lost cause of the highest order if you ever hope for the sweet sensitive young man from Delirium.  (Oh well...hope springs, right?)<br />Hana's part in the story serves the same function as a chatty friend in a quiet room.  Her point-of-view, while not essential to the plot did provide some entertainment during lulls in the story.<br /><br />Not even the ending was enough to warm the tepid temp of this read.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver writes wonderfully of course, there is no question of that.  The problem here is that the story needed to showcase her talents was spent on Pandemonium.  Requiem, it seems suffers from the curse of, \\"I promised them three books, and I have to deliver.\\"<br />Oh well, we'll always have Delirium.<br /><br />This honest review of a literary work is a cross post from my blog.
0811877485|1.0|I LOVE Eric Carle. So, when it came time to do the grandbaby's nursery, these were a no brainer. They're easy to work with, bright in color and look amazing. Yet, at the same time, I HATE this product. Why? Because the two larger decals (and the most important), the caterpillar and the butterfly are actually folded in the packaging. The fold stays in the decal which leads to its tendency to come off the wall no matter how smooth your surface is. So, I rate the product one star because without the caterpillar and butterfly, what do you have left?
B009KG7EMC|5.0|I saw part of the movie on TV. Looked good, got to checking, found out there were two, had to have them. I like to see the actors I know in movies. I also like it when the good guys win.
B00AESN8XY|5.0|I waited for several months for the necroa virus to be released. Then another month for the android/kindle release. It was absolutely worth it. The new gameplay and graphics were amazing. Note: there us a reason that it must be purchased if you did not beat the game in brutal mode. I personally beat brutal, but necroa took several tries to beat. That aside, it would defiantly be worth buying.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|it colts off of temple run but in a good way it is not the same but not difrent so it is rely fun to play.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|This app is really good once you get into it but at the beginning of it is rubbish because you can't get very far so it gets boring. Also once you have played it for a while it does become a bit repetitive.
B000OLGCI4|5.0|My grandchild and I have watched it at least 20 times already :)<br />I was worried about buying it, but it has more than met my expectaions.
B00BM1AJIO|3.0|was rather easy and went through this like a hot knife through butter... graphics are good plot is fair but far to easy unless your 12 years old
B000F8O35U|5.0|My grandchild and I watch it every weekend :)<br />I was worried about buying it, but it has more than met my expectaions. I am thinking about getting another one.
B009FZFONO|5.0|We still love it!<br /><br />There are some really interesting episodes this season that make it apparent that their perception of the zombies has shifted and now the real threat is the other humans... sort of Lord of the Flies in examining human nature.<br /><br />If you don't want to go that deep - there's still a lot of impressive zombie killing.
B00760BPOC|5.0|Love these books. Cant wait to go to bed at night so keep reading! Sad to have to wait so long for the next one
B005LAII1C|5.0|i could not see  it in the theater  so i bought it and i love the movie so much that i wish there was a sequel
B002WV5A9G|5.0|well done introduction to the crew of the original star trek series. A slightly humorous look at each character. Scotty and Bones are great.
B00B23O96A|2.0|I have been a Clapton fan since forever, I am not a fan of this CD.  Clapton has been doing blues for some time no but this is a little hard on the ears.
B0027MJU00|5.0|I was pulled into this book from the beginning. It is a dark story, but so many interesting turns in the plot keep the reader intrigued. I highly recommend it.
0316044938|3.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was unique story in that its told from by a 14-year-old girl that ha already died and gone to heaven. It was refreshing to read how she thought of everyone else's actions. She understands the struggles her family and friends go through this hard time, and she tries to reach out to them, letting them know she's still with them. It was really sad to watch her parents struggle with their marriage and separate for a while. Unfortunately, this is incredibly common with parents that lose young children. It happened in my family as well. However, these people learns to cope with the death of their daughter/sister/friend and move on with their lives. Truly a great story! I really enjoyed reading it and look forward to reading other novels by Alice Sebold.
B00BI4H6S6|2.0|I was looking forward to this series. Got through season 1 and bought season 2, with a little bit of concern about<br />what I thought was totally unnecessary content. I'm no prude, by any means, but if this isn't the soft pornography,<br />I don't know what is. I'm not sure why an excellent story like this needed scenes of very graphic sex acts, including<br />acts of homosexuality, to enhance the story. They could have been much more subtle and made the same point. It has<br />actually turned me off to watch the rest of season 2. I'll probably make my way thru it as the Bluray was expensive,<br />but for those of you who don't find soft pornography \\"enlightening\\" you should pass on this. It adds nothing to the<br />story and is quite, in my opinion, cringe worthy.<br /><br />Well acted, the dwarf, or \\"imp\\" character is an amazing actor, sets are wonderful, costumes great, and I like the story, but there are graphic<br />(soft porn) scenes of lesbian masturbation, oral sex, homosexual encounters, full frontal nudity, men included. This advances<br />nothing in the series and this content is in every episode that you will watch. I don't think I'll finish the series.<br />Too bad as it's almost epic.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game I soooooooo cool and for each holiday it changes the them.<br />The one bad thing about it is thar sometimes it goes really slow and freeze up well who cares if there is only 1 thing wrong that's fine so anyway it still is so fun everybody should get it :):):):):):):)
B005LAIHSG|4.0|A very well done movie and adaptation of a fairy tale.  I loved the photography and most of the choices for actors.  The only thing I would have changed is the actor for Snow White, that girl can not act.
0307720950|5.0|Chris Anderson tells an inspiring tale , that documents our factories of the past and predicts the fabricators of the future.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|My 3 year old daughter and I both love this app!! Great way to spend time with the little ones.
1439152802|5.0|The Secret Keeper is a beautiful book. It deals with many complex family issues. Laurel's mother is dying and while trying to come to terms with it she begins to search through her mothers past to unlock a childhood secret that has haunted her. As her search continues she learns more about what her mother experienced during World War II.<br /><br />This is where all of the twists and turns begin. I'm not going to give anything else away but it's hard to guess where the story is going right up to the end. I cried and cried when it was over so you may want to have a hankie ready!
0385344333|5.0|Enjoyed the product and the service. Thanks thanks thanks thanks thanks and more to come from me in the future.
B007712XAU|5.0|The PBS version of the show makes it even more exciting for her and her friends to enjoy when enjoying the series!
B00BP4Z8XY|5.0|My kids love the movie, my girls kept saying girl power to the girl candy racer.<br />Better and cheaper than going to the theaters.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love knowing I can see what the weather holds for me in my area. It is so easy to review...
B00BSBU4EC|5.0|My kids love the movie, streaming from wifi to my Motorola Xoom Tablet to a Brookstone projector  inside our 4 men tent<br />in the backyard was one of best memorable a dad can have with a 7 year old boy and 4 year old twin girls.
B0063GORYU|5.0|This is a game I play when I want to  relax. It is a solitare that is a challenge to do.
0316067598|5.0|Great book!  Highly recommended!  A first hand look into Marcus Luttrell's story of operation redwing.  Over all very satisfied with book.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This game intrigues me. I find it relaxing and would let small children play this.It does take patience waiting for more coins.
B000VYX8PE|5.0|Great book! You should definitely read this book!! I can't wait to read the2nd one!<br />I finished this book  in 3 and a half days!

B00AYDC5HY|5.0|He is the master at telling these types of stories.  This is no exception.  It is beautiful to look at and I love the fact that he decided to produce it in black and white which harkens back to the original Frankenstein.  The character design is great and the characters are quite lovable.  I great twist on the boy and his dog story.  I wish I could have a Frankenweenie of my own
0062238868|5.0|After reading this book, it pisses me off more that Chris was killed the way he was.  Read this book and you will see why.  He was a badass sniper!  Feared by all enemy
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Good performances but too little action. Hopkins and Mirren do a great job of making their characters believable, I grew up on Hitchcock and Anthony Hopkins 'brought him back to life'.
B002QE3CTY|5.0|My 35 year old son told me to read this book. I loved it. You never quiet know why things were happening the way they were. I love the different personalitys in the book and how they would bond to make a true frielndship. These are young kids in there teens, put together to save eachother and get to a safe place.<br />Really good book, that keeps you wanting more. By the way there is more, three more to be exact. I ordered the books on my kindel. The books are so intriguing you can't put them down. I ordered all 4 books and just couldn't stop till I was done.<br />The juist of the story is the teens have to find a cure for a deadly desease that has been unleashed on the World. It truely is an advinture that will keep you going wanting more.  Loved it.
B00AHSIQWE|4.0|It's probably the 2nd best Batman movie made.  Very much enjoyed it although the ending is a bit overwrought!  Definitely didn't regret the time i spent watching it and my 15 year old son was a huge fan of this movie.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I liked the new people brought on board. Made for good watching.<br />Love the house, the cloths, the props, the style of life.<br />You fill like having tea while watching it.
B004U8VWLE|3.0|The movie was underwhelming.  Had dark themes that could've been more interesting but they weren't developed enough.  They just put it out there to titilate the drone masses.  It's a fairly depressing movie which would be ok if the characters were deeper and more interesting.  Not NP's best role or performance.  Also, let's face it, there were WAY too many heterosexual men for this to be believable as depicting a realistic ballet company.  Having had multiple family members involved in ballet at a high level...i can attest to the fact that while there are some, hetero males play an insignificant role in this particular performing art!  The movie might be worth watching for free sometime but can't give it much more than a weak, half thumb's up.
B005Q1W0ZQ|5.0|Picks right up from season 1. As always, love the house, the cloths, the different people that come and go, and<br />the drama. You wish by some chance you could have been born into this family. Wounderful entertainment.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Refreshing, well acted, interesting plot lines, relevant even though from another age.  My wife talked me into watching this with her and I was VERY reluctant.  Nevertheless, i'm hooked and it's quite good.  We are now fully caught up w/ the current season and it may be losing something in that it's tough to keep thinking up new, interesting plot lines.  I do love the way the Brits (unlike Americans) aren't afraid to kill off main characters.  Refreshing to be treated like an adult!
B004J4WLB4|5.0|This is a beautiful story that was also deeply sad,but with just the right touch. I fell in love with flowers and motherhood all over again.

B0037471TE|5.0|Great and exiting book. Keeps you on the edge of the seat whole the time. I strongly recommend it, both for adults and youth.
1594202842|5.0|I have 4 kids that I love dearly and I sincerely want this best for them now and in the future. This book really helped me see that to have better boundaries in my kids life may seem harsh at the moment, but in the future it will produce dividends in their lives.  You may not agree with everything in stated in this book, but you will gain some positive take-aways from reading this book.
B008220C38|2.0|From the opening moments of this movie, it's clear that you're in for an unconventional ride. Is this a theatrical experience or a cinematic one... or something else entirely? It's like the writers, director and producer sat down with a bong to do the brainstorming for this and settled on the opinion that, \\"Yeah, that's a good idea\\" without thinking things through. For instance, there are scenes when everything freezes except the main character. Or things are moving right along in a realistic manner and then suddenly everyone is on stage with a really fake looking backdrops. Or in the dance scene, some of the dancers are moving, but not all of them. It's distracting. What am I supposed to be looking at and why? Those things seem to serve no purpose other than to be creative.<br /><br />If you are going to do a movie about a book, there should be some semblance of the original story. This movie does a terrible job at that as well. I get that maybe you want to highlight a different aspect, tell it from a different perspective or turn an angle here and there, but this is so far from the original that it ceases to be a tragedy. I didn't feel any pity for Anna at all. She came across as insensitive, selfish, arrogant and finally crazy. This wasn't a love story. It was a common story of a bored, immature wife having a cheap affair.<br /><br />If you are going to do a remake of a movie, you should do something different or do it better. It's different, but not better. The Vivian Leigh version is definitely the best.<br /><br />The movie manages to earn 2 stars in my book, however, because the costuming and settings are delicious! Whether we are in the country with paupers or dining with the Russian aristocracy, it's a delight for the eyes.<br /><br />The acting has some high points. Jude Law (Karenin), Olivia Williams (Countess Vronsky), and Emily Watson (Countess Ivanova) were excellent. Unfortunately that was not enough to make up for the rest of the cast. I normally love Matthew MacFadyen but he was too British. In fact, the whole cast was too British. Despite the snow, the furs, and the Russian names, there was no Russian feel about this piece at all. I found that a big detraction. Casting Keira Knightly in the lead role was also a mistake. She is always the same. It's like she figured out a formula and said, \\"This has worked for me before. I am sticking to it.\\" She just hasn't grown as an actress at all. She's not 21 anymore, but she still has the immaturity of a girl. Her part lacked juice. I couldn't relate to her and didn't care about her. Without that, the movie is a flop.<br /><br />If you are thinking about buying it, rent or stream it first. It's a two hour disaster that  is easily avoided.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|wonderfully written, excellant story, makes you proud to be am American. Got shivers down my spine. Really a good book
B005LAIII0|5.0|Ang Lee is pretty damn amazing. Here is a Chinese filmaker with an ouvre that includes such varied work as Brokeback Mountain, Hulk, Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon, Eat Drink, Man Woman, Lust, Caution, and now Life of Pi (all except for Hulk pretty brilliant). That one man can capture both the unique Chinese flavor of Crouching Tiger and the Western American rhythm of Brokeback. Amazing.<br /><br />Now we have this film, which resists all categorization. At one level, it's an eminently watchable survival adventure and pure visual treat. I haven't read the book yet (I will now), but I have to asume it has a fable-like quality, and so does the film. The color alone is surreal and intense. The cinematography is gorgeous. Some of the shots... woah. There is some odd unreal nighttime lighting here too -- although it works. There is very heavy use of shallow depth of field to good effect.<br /><br />It's worth noting that I saw the film in 3D, which has clearly graduated from three years ago when it was only for the likes of Alice in Wonderland (hiss) and How to Train Your Dragon. Now we have it in high budget literary adventure religious allegory. Interestingly, I'm pretty convinced that 3D has the effect of decreasing realism. It makes everything look like CGI, heightened, super-real, like an HDR photograph.<br /><br />The acting is also superb. The casting of Pi at various ages is dead on. All three are highly emotive. And the tiger -- who is presumably 90% CGI -- he's the stuff of legend. There is one damn cool animal. The soggy cat hanging off the side of the boat is just so sad, lest us forget that the Bengal Tiger is the world's most dangerous land animal. Tiger's are fast, deadly, climb, swim, and can bat your head off with one paw. Imagine sharing a lifeboat with one! There's a 19th century tiger known to have killed over 430 men.<br /><br />The film is to beautiful, that the ocean itself, and its bevy of sea life, becomes a character. As desperate as Pi (and Richard Parker the Tiger) are, they can't help but marvel at the little seen wonders that present, and us with them.<br /><br />Thematically, I'm not yet sure how to digest Life of Pi. It's a pretty deeply emotional movie, and at some level plays to the film medium's visual strengths. The picture hints at deeper philosophical notes, but doesn't really illuminate. I sense extreme abbreviation. After all, 450 pages of novel would result in perhaps six hours of film.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimedhard Parker the Tiger) are, they can't help but marvel at the little seen wonders that present, and us with them.<br /><br />Thematically, I'm not yet sure how to digest Life of Pi.

B00007KWHG|5.0|Since I grew up  in this era, I love this music and this CD is great to bring back memories.
B005LAIHQS|4.0|I picked this up because of the time travel angle, but it turned out to be a pretty fun film. It's not high art, and in fact it doesn't have anything new to say about time travel, or anything else either. It's also a ridiculous romp. A clear guilty pleasure.<br /><br />We begin with a good villain: Borris the Animal. He's plenty zany and has one arm and a face hugger that lives in his remaining hand. He also has it out for Tommy Lee Jones, who locked him up 40 years earlier. When he breaks out of his lunar prison, he wants nothing more than to travel back in time and kill our taciturn hero. Which he does. Will Smith then has to head back himself and put things to right.<br /><br />Josh Brolin plays \\"young Agent K\\" (Jones). The resemblance is uncanny, in looks, in voice, in mannerism. Jones himself isn't even in the film for more than a few minutes. There isn't any time travel paradox here. There's just hunt down the villain and try to kill him. But the film luxuriates in campy 1969 visual gags. Costumes, Andy Wharhol, the Apollo 11 launch, and so on. It's like Madmen without the drama. The rocket launch really is pretty cool.<br /><br />MIB puts its money on screen. There isn't a normal shot in the whole film. Aliens abound. Not exactly realistic. The tech difference over 40 years is handled in the same over-simplified manner as in X-men first class. Everything is the same, except it was bigger then, with 60s styling. Guns: bigger. Memory eraser: bigger. Aliens, definitely bigger (and slimier).<br /><br />Michael Stuhlbarg (Boardwalk Empire`s Arnold Rothstein) plays a very amusing four dimensional being. Defiantly found him groovy. I can't even remember the second MIB, but this one has to be better.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimed
B00AE9UYJ4|4.0|Considering the countless horrible slender games out now, this is the best. Got mine when it was the FAOTD so very good price, excellent graphics. Only downside is the fact that there are only 2 levels. If there  was an additional level or two then, by far, it would be 5 stars.
B00AFEYUVG|5.0|This film adaption is very faithful. Perhaps not so surprising because the author wrote and directed it! This is tremendously rare. It's unusual enough for an author to write his own adaption (I'm doing it for Untimed, but I'll dance the Snoopy dance if I can even get it produced, and set off fireworks if I land any kind of production roll. Actually directing it? That's a serious wet dream.)<br /><br />As a stand alone film, this is an excellent contribution to the teen angst drama. It's also funny at times. Not so much as the amazing Adventureland, but more serious and just different. Way better than the putrescent likes of Nick & Norah's Infinite Playlist.<br /><br />The acting is excellent. It's been obvious since Prisoner of Azkaban that Emma Watson would end up a serious babe. She's got looks, spunk, smarts, and charisma all locked down. Ezra Miller is also a standout as Patrick. The two of them have so much life in them that they overshadow Charlie -- he is, after all, a wallflower. Nina Dobrev (also a favorite of mine, but not as good an actress as Emma) has a small role as Charlie's sister. The part has a different feel than in the novel, nicer for the most part. Paul Rudd is good (albeit the part is a bit forced) as the teacher.<br /><br />The film doesn't go out of its way to reveal the time and place. As I saw it cold, not knowing anything about the story, I had to come to the gradual conclusion (based on music, costumes, lack of computers, etc) that this was the late 80s or early 90s. It was the presence of certain Nirvana songs that cinched the early 90s vibe.<br /><br />The film strips out a lot of little details about Charlie's family. This is to be expected, as in adaption, even of a short novel like this, something has to go. These changes thin out the parents and sister to cut outs. Sad, but there really isn't much else Chbosky could have done. He also stripped out most of the sexuality. A producer generated change? Probably, but the I liked the sudden dashes of it in the novel. A few of those tidbits stuck with me. But most importantly, the de-sexualization washed out the \\"twist.\\" It was so subtly handled in the film for fear of offending that I half-missed it, only fully realizing after the credits.<br /><br />There are also subtle character shifts. Charlie is a little more passive and trending toward schizophrenic in the novel. Sam a little more broken in the film. The sister is meaner in the book (although she comes around). It's hard to say how much of this is in the writing and how much is what the actors bring to bear. Some characters, like Patrick (who really is a great character), come through 110%.<br /><br />Overall, if you like teen films (and I do), see this one. It's several standard deviations above the mean.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimeddden dashes of it in the novel. A few of those tidbits stuck with me.

B0090SI42Y|2.0|I must preface by saying that I like Kung Fu movies -- and I've seen my share of them. The Man with the Iron Fists has the body of a new style Chinese Martial Arts film like House of the Flying Daggers, the brains of Enter the Dragon, and the soul of Machete -- although it's not nearly as much fun as Robert Rodriquez's similar riff on the Mexican Gangster film. Fists isn't really a Chinese film at all, although plenty of the talent is from the Middle Kingdom, but instead is a re-envisioned fantasy of the Kung Fu genre through the eyes of Wu-Tang mastermind and rapper RZA. He wrote, directed, and starred.<br /><br />There's a lot to like in this film (as a Kung Fu fan). The characters are pretty memorable in a comic book, kung fu, video game kind of way. They each have their own weapons, powers, and gimmicks. A few of them are even well acted (or over acted) like Russell Crowe's entertaining performance as Jack Knife or Lucy Liu as Black Widow. Many have bad hair.<br /><br />RZA and his titular character forms the weakest link. He's just flat. His voice over is hard to understand and the rapper voice narrating Kung Fu feels totally out of place. But his music's good. And despite some nearly incoherent editing and minimal storytelling, the overall style is pretty decent.<br /><br />The villains are pretty darn cheesy, particularly the heavy metal fright wig hair styles of the Lion Clan, but whatever, it's a campy almost spoof of the Kung Fu genre. It's gory as hell too, but despite numerous brothel scenes, strangely chaste (no nudity at all). Hmmm, there's that weird violence is better than sex thing. What gives? A big chunk of backstory on RZA's character shoved into the middle of the film is a total snooze-a-rama, but other than  that, the action scenes are exciting and the brothel scenes funny, so if you like the genre, go for it. Just remember, it's just no Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon and not even up to the standards of Kung Fu Hustle.<br /><br />Andy Gavin, author of The Darkening Dream and Untimedthor of The Darkening Dream and Untimed

B004ZN9OTG|4.0|What exactly made the rock and roll of the mid 1960's to the late 1970's so exciting, experimental and sometimes monumental in scope, with masterpieces like \\"Pet Sounds\\", \\"Abbey Road\\", \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\", \\"Physical Graffiti\\", etc.?  It's actually not a big mystery although one might think so.  The secret was simple:  the record executives of the big labels of the day were older, came from a different musical generation and to them all of these bands were over their heads, so they measured their worth by word of mouth, live gigs or just plain chance.  Now, music is broken down, analyzed, categorized and beaten to death before it ever gets out.  Bands are thrown into certain genres, never to stray.  Hence, many fans have been suckered into this trap too, and have become ridiculously intolerant of their favorite outfits stretching creative boundaries, trying new looks or anything else.  It's stupid, but society is oversimplified and demands strict regimentation while all the while deluding itself into thinking it's free thinking and lives on the \\"edge\\".<br />  Which is why we'll never repeat the days of music taking chances like Pink Floyd's storied career, going from pure insane psychedelia with Syd Barrett to proto-industrial and jazzy on \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" to paranoid and conceptual on \\"The Wall\\".  Were Floyd to start today, they would not be allowed to move past their debut album's sound, or would do so at their own risk.  \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" is not one of their stronger albums, and does not get mentioned as one of their essentials, but it is nonetheless an important developing stage for Pink Floyd.<br />  Other bands, most notably Deep Purple, the Moody Blues and Frank Zappa had been toying with classical influences and to some that led to the bloated progressive music of Yes and ELP.  However, while recognizing that classical music is the most influential form of Western music, it can be very dull and equally pretentious.  Pink Floyd managed on \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" to avoid the dull stuff, and utilized orchestral instruments to a more psychedelic direction.  The album thus contains some orchestration but also has plenty of what is becoming the more recognized Floyd sound, with Rick Wright's organ and David Gilmour stepping in more confidently as the master guitarist he is.  A few quiet pieces separate the two larger movements, and the album ends with \\"Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast\\", which is more sedate than the title might suggest, but still interesting in its merging of the musical instruments of the past with the sonic experimentation that defined the trippy music of 1970.<br />  Hard core fans are advised to check \\"Atom Heart Mother\\" out, and new fans need to be cautioned that this is not what they may expect, as is the case with anything pre-\\"Meddle\\" era Pink Floyd.  This CD falls just shy of where \\"Meddle\\" takes off.  It's a good CD on its own, and very much shows the progress of one of the world's greatest bands of all time.art Mother\\" to avoid the dull stuff, and utilized orchestral instruments to a more psychedelic direction.

B000Y5JFNE|3.0|I loved the film, even now that it is 25 years old, But was very disappointed to learn that (some of) the extras from the DVD released many years ago were not included. Even the reprint DVD is just the movie, no extras. One thing I like about Blu Ray is it has lots of storage space, so why weren't the trailers and TV spots from the original(20th anniv)DVD included? I almost sold my older DVD to get this one but I had $10 in Best Buy rewards so it only cost me $5. Which was a bargain.

B004SBS8LA|5.0|Fun game, my son loves it! Very easy and fun to play, very addicting!  Our family enjoys it a lot!
B0079XPUOW|5.0|I read a lot of sci-fi and have never read a story like this.  A lot is not explained but I still feel satisfied with the read.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It is a fun and addictive game game.  We play it for hours.  My daughter and I seam to be competing with each other.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The app is 7.7 MB, and I decided to download it over my 4g. Well as soon as I went to open the game, it started an additional download of 70MB! Nowhere does it say that this will happen when you download the game. I stopped the download and after reading additional reviews about the way that in-app purchases are handled (1 click, $99? really?), I decided to delete this app. It looks pretty but unfortunately, I have no comments about the actual app use.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Update came on my phone but not my tablet- I need it for the tablet more since I'm further- then I will be very happy
B007SGM084|4.0|If one is interesting in the sexual fantasies and actions of a horny couple, you have just the right book for you. It is hard to put these books down, and one ends up feeling sorry for the young man who has weathered such a miserable upbringing. I would not recommend this book to anyone under 20 or over 60. I am open minded and in the latter category, but you might have a few people not used to the action and language having heart attacks!
B00B99KJR0|4.0|Got for my Kindle Fire free. LOVE IT.<br /><br />Challenging but picks your move if you get stuck. Time can run out anyway though.<br /><br />One complaint after playing every day since getting it. I am stuck on the last level of Egypt. It is not self evident the aim of how to win that level (day 29 in game). Directions to that level would be helpful.

B00006JIA4|5.0|The show must go on! I never heard this sound before but it's an amazing song. It's has a lot of meaning quite literally and figuratively.  I enjoy the original version by Freddie Mercury and the new version as well. This is the answer if you like Queen at all and not sure what to buy. This collection has it all.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|Subway surfers is very addicting and when you start playing then you can't stop.I can't wait till the next version to come out.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I love the way Sparks tells his tale.  In this novel he draws sympathetic characters who seem destined for each other and throws in a  mystery as to why his lady has come to live in this particular town at this particular time.  He saves a surprise for the ending....at least I was surprised....and it left me thinking of destiny and BEYOND.

0142419400|5.0|In Stephanie Perkins' Anna and the French Kiss, Anna's horrible parents force her, against her will, to live out a fairy-tale coming of age in one of the most incredible cities on the planet.<br /><br />Anna's a girl after my own heart, other than the whole \\"I don't want to go to boarding school in Paris,\\" thing. I would have given up my post braces teeth to go to boarding school, and I would have sold my soul to go to boarding school in Paris.<br /><br />I digress. Anna is great. She's real, funny, open, and interesting. Also, she loves movies, friends, and beautiful British guys. She's a girl that we can read and enjoy without fear of negative results, such as female youth becoming useless.<br /><br />I've heard this book described as charming. It is most definitely that. I like to think of it as a giant bowl of mint chocolate chip ice cream being enjoyed in footie-pajamas and fuzzy slippers.

B0083I90HU|2.0|I will give this book 2 stars as I reserve a star rating to books that I really hate. There are 2 stories in this novel. A tragic story of Sarah who was a Jewish girl in 1942 and a self absorbed one deferential American woman living in France with her philandering husband sixty years later. If the whole story had focused on Sarah's story, this would have been an excellent read. Unfortunately the author spent too little time on Sarah's story and a great deal of time on Julia's sex life with her French husband. Sarah's story ended way to soon.<br /><br />To make matters worse, I listened to this as an audio book and the narrator was very poor. Her attempt to do character voices made a tragic situation laughable. It was like listening to a poorly performed puppet theater without being able to see the stage.

B00BHU9BV6|1.0|Unfortunately, I was unfamiliar with the fact that Anna Karenina is a remake of a well-known theatrical play. Now don't get me wrong, I loved the new remake of Les Mis. What I wish I would have known, prior to wasting my money on this rental, is that while watching the movie you are literally watching the play on stage. There is so much changing/switching of props scenery to literally make a person dizzy. I shut this off when I realized 10 min into the film that the style of movie shooting wasn't going to change. If you're one of the lucky people who stopped to read this review, in my opinion, don't waste you're time on this awfully shot version of Anna Karenina.

It was bad, bad, bad... I'm thinking about giving it away on e-bay & paying the shipping for someone to take it off my hands! I can't believe I paid (pre-paid) for this.

He founded Apple and he did make money and visions. Steve Wozniak however, liked to tinker. He knew how to make visions in reality. He knew what made them tick. This is his story.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Walking Dead is a great show! It's interesting how the characters have become almost used to the zombies, the real threat now is the evil people the group has to deal with. Parallel with real life in some ways, heartbraking and uplifting at the same time.
B002RSDW80|3.0|However, the movie grows on you. The merging of two lives together and their relationship. WARNING: do not watch this movie hungry, you will regret it. However it is a great love story how food brings two couples together in different times.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|My old cord had fell apart where all the coating had come off.  It must have dried out over time.  I called Amazon and they sent this replacement right away.  I am very pleased.
B000TXZVGQ|5.0|The story of highschool friends dealing with controversial subjects, e.g. Sexual identity, drugs, parental abuse. There where a view instances when the Network wanted to cancel some of the episodes and even the entire series, yet it was released. A great cast, and great story writing. How did all of this evolve into &#34;teen mom & Jersey Shores&#34;?
B00AREIAI8|3.0|No problems other than u have to buy stuff with real money but other than that I really haven't had any. Problems yet and that's a good thing I guess
B0001XAPY2|5.0|Different from the normal Stuff, still very entertaining. This is a great movie out of the house of Miyazaki. I purchased this to complete my collection, 100% complete!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|Very disappointed,I couldn't play it though as I wasn't aware at the time of ordering that it wouldn't play in Australia
B00000K3D4|4.0|Or so my wife says. I gave this one to her. But it got Henson Puppets, and David Bowie. If you like the 80's this is for you.
1610454812|5.0|LOVE&lt; LOVE &lt; LOVE this audio series.  A friend loaned this to my husband and he absolutely loved it and told me I had to listen to it.  Although I listened to the series loaned to us by a friend, I bought one so could loan it out and let my friends and co-workers (we all do a lot of on the driving so the audio series works great) listen to it. You WILL NOT regret purchasing this item. Very good inspirational, true story. God Bless our Troops!
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|The first time i didn't like this movie. However, after a while it does grow on you. There is some slapstick (talking dogs), some sadness (the pain of being old), and human emotion (the power of friendship). One of Disney's better movies.
B0000C9ZBW|5.0|I gave it to my son for his birthday and he said that it is great and very comfortable.  He likes the weight of the watch.
B0001XAPZ6|5.0|This is the remastered version of the 80's version. Truly a Miyazaki movie, dealing with flying and an outlandish story. 100% complete Ghibly collection@!
B00BRR66SA|5.0|One of the best albums of this year. JT and timbaland...the dynamic duo. Every song is a platinum smash.  Music that is real and meaningful
B003E48AYC|4.0|the official movie when Tim buried the hatchet with the house of Disney. He's back and this is a great darker adaptation of the classic tale. The only better adaptation is Alice McGee's version.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|I was so excited to watch another Joe Wright/Keira Knightley masterpiece, and I even tried to ignore all of those who said it was bad, but...it was baaad. Dialogue was laughable, some casting choices weren't the best, and overall, the setting of a \\"stage\\"-like performance was..confusing. To all Tolstoy fans, keep moving on. Nothing to see here.
B004BQVGHK|5.0|This is a great movie out of the house of Miyazaki. I purchased this to complete my collection, 100% complete!
B005K0HDGE|4.0|however It took 48 years to read it!  It was interesting and started well...I would like to see a different ending.
B001HN69B8|4.0|A good concept, Plus it got Heath Ledger. Definitely one of his better works. The story is quite far out, yet intriguing and logical.
0064400557|5.0|reading this book brought back such happy childhood memories that i shared with my kids!<br />can't wait to watch the movie with them....
B002VECM6S|4.0|A touching story that is based on a true story. The story of Michael Oher. I wonder when they're pushing a sequel out, considering the 2012 superbowl. There should be a followup.
B000NTPDSW|5.0|If you are a fan of the Godfather you will love this.  Everything in one slim package and blu ray/  I love the autograph as well
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love it so much! Right when I started I had a lot of money. It is fun and interactive.
B004KPQK2S|4.0|As far as how well this portrays the &#34;true story&#34; of Secretariat, I don't know as this is the first I'd heard the story but I feel it is a good introduction to a bit of history & more can be discovered. A movie is seldom going to tell a full story of something unless it is a documentary. My 3-10 year olds LOVED the story.  There were a couple words in the movie my kids are not used to hearing but could be used as a teaching time.
B00BJA2VFW|5.0|This is such a cute game. Very additive. I have retired and I can use my Kindle more, and I can't put this game down. Love to see the little people work.
0345337581|5.0|As we all should no,skill rarely comes without hard work and sacrifice. This book must not be taken out of context in that it makes some fairly bold/magical claims. If one really were to put the work in, they could drastically improve their memory with respect to certain things.
B00B7IJBUY|3.0|I'm a huge Jovi fan who has gotten through the best of times (New Jersey, These Days) and the worst (Bounce, The Circle) and you know what?  I actually like this album despite agreeing with the general consensus that the direction has gone decidedly \\"middle of the road\\".<br /><br />I can't believe people are still expecting another 'Prayer or Bad Medicine - I know they're classics and I'd sing my heart out when they're played, but the only bands making that type of music are cover bands or parodies; Bon Jovi want to move on but their fans aren't letting them and the consequences are the atrocious attempt at capturing former 'glories' such as Bounce, The Circle and to a lesser extent, Have a Nice Day.  I know those albums have their fans but it's all about opinions right?<br /><br />This Left Feels Right was a bad attempt at something but at least it was an attempt (a more conventional stripped down approach would've been better); Lost Highway had some fantastic moments but was deemed too country by some folk, and What About Now has the band attempting another direction but having to make compromises to satisfy the fans who don't want to move on - hence what we get is 'middle of the road'.<br /><br />Richie Sambora has shown through his solo work what an outstanding songwriter he truly is but Jon has also; I loved Destination Anywhere and Blaze of Glory - both these talented artists show what they're capable of outside of the Bon Jovi framework.<br /><br />What About Now is far from perfect but whereas The Circle sounded forced, this latest release sounds natural and should be a starting point for how the band should progress.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Very easy at first with an nice rate of increase in difficulty.  Overall super fun. Obviously very similar to games of old but not an exact copy.
B00AEFXLBQ|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies! It shipped within the predicted time. I am so glad to now own this movie!
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Fast and efficient with the mailing.  Film  excellent.  Love the series and the fact by buying the DVD I can watch it whenever I want.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|I loved this book as much as I did the first book.  Rothfuss has a great command of words and he paints a beautiful story.  The characters are rich which keeps the pages turning.<br /><br />The beauty of the genre, for me, is the pairing of an extraordinary character with the challenges of a larger than life situation and seeing just how that character reacts.  Most of the time there is such a human element to the solution that you can not help but relate and feel vindicated.  Being in a fantasy only amplifies the emotion.<br /><br />The book is very well written and shows the authors grasp, love and passion for the art.  Anyone could love the series just for that, but the story is very compelling, as well.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Classic Stephen King!  Gripping and intense, though the ending leaves one hanging.  Steve never disappoints his &#34;Constant Reader&#34;!  Loved it!
B0087DIEGE|5.0|This is a must have accessory for your XZ-1. Brilliantly simple and elegant. I normally shoot Nikon DSLRs, but bought an XZ-1 for a trip and didn't want to lug all my gear. This was a very nice addition to the camera and eliminates the need for a traditional lens cap. I agree with everyone that has said this should have came with the camera, but regardless, it is well worth the money. Just turn the camera on and it is ready to fire.<br /><br />I contemplated purchasing a cheaper alternative, but decided that this looked a little more refined and I typically lean towards factory parts anyway. This is a very high quality accessory from Olympus and can't offer any feedback for the off-brand ones.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|It's fun ...I like it..no problems ..I love the horses..and I love the games..it has never messed up on me so far..the picture it great.
B005KDWUFA|5.0|What an enjoying evening . These men know how to entertain. Such beautiful voices. I never get tired of listening to them. I only wish I could find the words in English.
0345535421|5.0|This was a great follow up to Game of Thrones.  I enjoyed all of the characters.  Martin set up the clash between the kings well.  The complexity of the plots and characters, really lent it self well to the story line.<br /><br />It was a definite page turner.  As soon as I finished this book, I busted open the 3rd book
B00AQB2A3I|5.0|I've been a Porcupine Tree/Steven Wilson fan for about 14 years now. Insurgentes was probably my favorite album of the century's first decade (still not entirely sure what to call that span of time)...Raven, in my humble opinion, is way better even than that previous outing. There are startling, almost cinematic moments but also genuinely tender ones. This is truly one of the best progressive rock albums ever.
B001OST0LW|4.0|this is one of my favs, like Val Kilmer , one of his best .....stunts and continuity was well done.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|One it works offline and you don't have to be on it all the time I was on it before work and on my break I went on it to find my energy refilled
B002NPUCIA|5.0|Brian Culbertson is a excellent musician, I love his song and his style.<br />This DVD is nice, the performance is amazing.
B002VWONB2|5.0|&#34;Citizen Kane&#34; is often hailed as the greatest film of all time - or at least the greatest American film of all time.  (And deservedly so, in my opinion.)  But in poll after poll &#34;Casablanca&#34; is rated as the best-LOVED film of all time.  And it deserves the accolades as well.  A tense suspense film, a touching love story, a in between moments of great comedy.  Bogart was never cooler, tougher or more tender.  Bergman is luminous, achingly vulnerable, brave and more beautiful than ever.  The whole supporting cast is amazing, from the troika of Greenstreet, Lorre and Raines, to the amazing Warner Bros. rep company.  (Many of them actual refugees from Hitler's Europe.)  And the Nazis make the perfect villains.  Endlessly quotable and watchable.  See it you haven't already.  I envy the experience of discovering this classic.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I had heard so much about Downton Abbey and how good it is.  I never knew that once I got started on it I would not be able to stop.  It is that good.  I sat one rainy, dreary weekend and watched all 27 episodes of it...Season 1, 2 & 3.  It is a GREAT series.
B003NTSBTC|4.0|I would maybe give 4.5 stars if it would let me (aka 9/10), but I'm not willing to give 5/5 because some of the middle portion of the movie seemed to drag a little, and at times the action felt frail or one-dimensional. In retrospect, I understand why, but I guess I would hope that the development could have been a little less sparse and a little more entertaining. Still, the ending was so extremely incredible, I've no problem in saying it's a great movie.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|I love the Ice Age movies.  Although this one is not a funny as the first one, it still has its moments.  And finally Diego gets a girlfriend !!!
B000SEIK2S|5.0|Read this in just a few days.  Couldn't put it down. Very engaging and a really unique tale. Well written and fast paced. Highly recommended for anyone who likes a good science fiction yarn.

0425263908|3.0|This author was recommended by someone in my book club. If you are in to adult erotica then you may enjoy this. In some ways, I thought it had more substance than the Fifty Shades trilogy. The back story was certainly more interesting. But for the most part I feel like the names have changed but not much else. There are a lot of other titles I would recommend before this one.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Very fun, realistic, addictive, well executed game. recommended for horse people and non-horse people alike. Love love love love love love this game!!!!
B0066WJLU6|5.0|I am DISABLED. My husband works nights. ALWAYS having a light right at hand is AMAZING and My husband worries a lot less. Everything that is promised, it DOES. We all know a flashlight cannot always be found, even if in a drawer nearby. The FLASHLIGHT APP on my Kindle CAN be. The basic version is FREE, that is what I have, and it is Brighter than any other device(even some \\"real\\" flashlights). Easy for any user no matter age or handicap! We both Thank You for this App!:):):)
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I can't wait to see the movie! This was very hard to put down. I enjoyed every page of this book
B002YCVX5S|5.0|I thought it was quite clever, if a little too bloody.  But that's typical Quentin Tarantino.  The cast was amazing.
B009OINFH4|4.0|An easy read for those responsible for people or for those wanting to 'move' people!<br />It identifies that most of us are in the business of 'moving' people - and how we go about it. In particular, the ability to get to a conversation which creates a win-win. My favourite line &#34;it's about leading with my ears, instead of my mouth&#34;. And, there are loads of practical examples to try & implement.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|Okay once the season dvd's arrive - all else goes by the wayside, until we've watched them all!  Not disappointed in 3rd season's ability to draw us in yet again.  Wonderful acting, beautiful scenery, heart-wrenching plot twists - masterfully crafted yet again.
B00BRR66SA|5.0|I love this album! The songs are long but I enjoy them. It's a more mature, grown-up sound for JT. I'm a huge Justin fan and I've been waiting for a new album from him and I can definitely say I'm not disappointed. Good job JT!!! :)
B004SUDQE0|4.0|When I visited Wales, I spent some time in the village where this movie was filmed and where some of the locals had worked as extras in the film.  Knowing that there is a kind of love-hate relationship between the Welsh and the English, made the plot of  this movie even more interesting to me. Two English fellows working as cartographers measuring hills and mountains in Wales during the period of WW-I figuratively step on the toes of the locals when they discuss with the Welsh that the nearby &#34;mountain&#34; that they hold so dear, may not be a mountain at all, but is only a hill (a mountain had to be at least 1,000 feet elevation above sea level to appear on His Majesty's maps -- and this one is just short of that elevation.. The younger surveyor (Hugh Grant falls for a local girl (Tara Fitzgerald).  There is much humor, Welsh-style throughout the movie. some subtle and some that provokes guffaws. The villagers decide that no one, especially an Englishman, is going to tell that their beloved mountain is only a hill and won't appear on the map. The whole village arises en masse and starts making the hill taller, using buckets and wheelbarrows full of good Welsh soil -- much of it taken from the village's previous carefully manicured soccer field.  Colm Meany plays the role of the village pub keeper who seems to have a way with the village lasses. Movie gives the viewer a tiny peek at ancient Welsh history, Welsh informal naming customs, Welsh countryside, and justifiable Welsh pride.  Funny movie.
0786915749|3.0|I honestly can't finish this. I realized way too late why I couldn't follow this book: It's the narrator. I prefer books that tell the story from one character's perspective at a time. This book, however, is the \\"floating narrator,\\" as I like to call it. It floats over the action and tells us everything that's happening and what everyone is thinking all at the same time. There's nothing to latch onto. It's like floating down a river. I'm halfway through and can't tell what's going on or why I should care. I love the book's cover, but that's the only good thing I can say.<br /><br />And enough with the adverbs in nearly every paragraph. Barf!<br /><br />Update:<br />I finally finished the 70 pages I had left when I wrote the above review. Overall, the book was cute, with imaginative imagery, but I still think it's a badly written novel. There were some instances when the authors went from a character's thought to narration, and I thought it was still thought because none of it was italicized.<br /><br />And the villain is introduced at the very end of the book, and I didn't care one way or another if the heroes defeated him. There's just so much wrong with this book. I didn't hate it, but I'm in no hurry to read the next.
B00AN0KBJC|4.0|Really enjoyed this season; well worth watching although less 'true-to-the-book' as the first season (loved it!). The different story lines also became out of sync which was jarring to someone who has read the book(s), hence 4/5 *'s, but again, well worth watching!
B00992CF6W|5.0|I play it all the time. its my favorite thing to do when I have free time. I will never get tired of this game

B001NLKT60|4.0|I have read the complete trilogy and was entranced. It was a bit of a struggle dealing with the names but that was a minor impediment. The death of Larsson was a great loss to the literary world.
B0087ZG7HK|5.0|As the title states, Spielberg's recreation of the novel is splendid.  Personally I saw this on opening day back in 1993.  Today I have a 4 year old who loves dinosaurs.  My wife and I were looking for something to help her imagination and purchased J.P. a few weeks ago.  Since then, I have watched it with my daughter four times and I can guess there will be many more viewings in the future.
B003YL4LYI|4.0|There is a bit more of the fantasy and magic in this book. However, the plot develops the fates of the characters that remain after the first four books in a compelling way, especially that of Tyrion Lannister.

0425252868|4.0|Before the fantasy world of video game warfare and the very real world of drone warfare, the fighter and bomber pilots pioneered the concept of remote battle. Primal battles with rocks, spears, and knives were rather intimate events. But technology has made the distances between combatants greater, allowing for more abstract and dehumanizing confrontations.<br />\\"A Higher Call\\" is about a World War II pilot who fought against those numbing tendencies of aerial warfare and on one particular incident risked his life to save an enemy.<br />Adam Makos early in life became fascinated with the stories of WWII, hearing the stories of his grandfathers. He built model airplanes, read about the war and watched movies about the war, but then took his interest a step further. He began interviewing other veterans of the war and told their stories in a self published newsletter while still in high school and on through his college years. Out of school, he started a publishing company devoted to preserving the stories of WWII veterans while they were still around to tell them.<br />Makos himself had make a decision to depersonalize the enemy (the Germans and the Japanese.) He would only tell stories of Allied soldiers and then only stories that put \\"our\\" people in a good light. He would not tell the enemies side of the story.<br />That was the case until he met a veteran bomber pilot by the name of Charlie Brown (no reference is ever made to Charles Schultz' creation.) Brown said he had an extraordinary story if he heard the other side, from the lips of German fighter pilot Franz Stigler.<br />Makos begins Stigler's story not when he was a soldier, but after the war and then tells Stigler's life from when he was a child. We are allowed to see Stigler not as an enemy, but as a man.<br />Eventually we get to the battle that brought Brown and Stigler together. I'd rather not talk about what those circumstances were; how much better for you to read the story from Makos (with assistance from Larry Alexander.) It's a rather brutal tale in ways, but it ends with an amazing note of grace.<br />Brown and Stigler were both religious men. Brown, a devout Methodist and Stigler, in his heart a devout Catholic (though he was excommunicated for the sin of dueling.) At the heart of the book is the question that was asked of Jesus, \\"Who is my neighbor?\\" In that way, you can look at \\"A Higher Call\\" as a powerful version of story of \\"The Good Samaritan.\\" (2013, Berkley Caliber Books)e from Larry Alexander.)

B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|Ordered the movie when it first became available, got it when it was released.  Yes, the extended version will come out later, but I can watch the theater version anytime I want now.  Yes, I'll also buy the extended versions when they come out too.  As to the movie itself, Peter Jackson and crew did an excellent job, not only of putting the movie together, but in staying true to Tolkien. He would have been proud.  I only gave it a five star rating because ten wasn't available.  Got it; get it.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|My husband read this and found it accurate and a fast read. The situations and realisim he found fairly accurate along with the writters thoughts.

B00BWJARHO|3.0|Very long and dragged out. I don't see how this is gonna be a 3 part movie. Besides that it wasn't too bad but fell asleep once because got bored with parts in movie that they added in that they really shouldn't have. Graphics not too bad but you can tell some parts that it looks really fake. Animation in movies these days just look childish in my opinion. The action kept me into the movie.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I really enjoyed this game. The graphics were good, the puzzles were better and it had a story that was interesting right away.
B009IQG5LK|5.0|All star cast, great story, and brings back great memories. I watched this movie everyday when I was a kid. I even had a watch walkie talkie from the movie. When I saw it came out on Blu ray I nearly fell off my seat. I immediately ordered my copy. Great Picture, sound it's definitely the must have.
B000GT6KEU|3.0|I clicked on the blue-ray and than instant -- bought for 9.99 and turns out it wasn't HD.

Just be aware this isn't the HD version!

158270208X|5.0|I agree with a previous reviewer that the \\"best\\" journal is one you create yourself....however....if you are like me, sometimes starting with that which resonates with the author is a good place for beginnings.  Use this journal to get into a good habit instead of wringing your hanky over how to set it up, should I have pictures?, where do I get good sayings, what is going to resonate with me....<br /><br />When you have established your habit and/or used up the pages in this book, you can continue with your own form of journaling.  I now use a plain ole notebook.  But, I started with Byrnes and managed to learn a few things along the way.  Good Journaling, however you do it!

It is the perfect mix of sounds, traditional and possibly boring at a superficial level, but deep, melodramatic and progressive in a way that exposes a deep understanding of how to make gratifying music if you give a proper listen.  This is his best album to date.
B00371XIJE|5.0|Hachi is a wonderful movie. It celebrates the life of a dog that is very obedient and loves his master. It is a tear jerker especially for those who are DOG lovers like moi. Watch it. You'll fall in love with HACHI!
B0060MYM3S|5.0|Haven't read any of the books. My wife has. She loves it. I love it.<br />The series is enthralling. Get it now.
B00AH8FTT2|3.0|Have enjoyed the previous two episodes, but this latest offering doesn't match it in the intrigue and interest!<br />This book is obviously a lead in to the next volume, almost like a mini series on the TV. Hey that's an idea!
B007THA4FI|2.0|I didn't enjoy this much, jumped back and forth too much for my taste. It didn't draw me in like most books.
B00846TRHY|5.0|For those who question what their purpose is and for those who want to know what is really going on in other<br />countries....this is a must see. I do warn you.....you may experience a roller coaster ride of emotions!
B000JCSBU0|3.0|This movie portrays delusion with drug abuse very well.  Depressing but it's well acted and written. Not a feel-good movie!
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Perfect mix of skill and strategy combined with a bit of &#34;luck of the draw&#34; twists. Due to the board design every game is played on a different field and I have yet to not find myself at the end of one game planning my strategy for the next! The rules are straightforward and easy to learn and the card trading aspect really engages every player. Highly recommend!
B0000DZEA1|5.0|Great movie and great music. As described in the info. Thank you so much, I got exactly what i asked and hoped for, i may buy from you again someday.
0062183591|3.0|the book is well-written in most respects.  Ariely does use appropriate 'scientific' methodology.  However, his premises and conclusions become quite repetitive after a while, with little new or original material in the way of hypotheses or conclusions as the book wore on.  Not much in the book which is much different from other works by the same author.<br /><br />Most disappointing, however, was the &#34;service&#34; received on this order.  Shipping confirmation from &#34;Cirdan&#34; was received on January 28, with a projected delivery date of Februaru 2-19.  The book did not arrive until February 28.  Contacting UPS, i was not able to receive confirmation it had even been shipped until February 17.  Either the &#34;Cirdan&#34; confirmation was fraudulent, or they shipped by UPS &#34;hiker&#34; delivery instead on UPS ground.  They can't use the excuse that it was shipped to Alaska either, because another product which was ordered the same day, was shipped (according to confirmation) two days later (January 30), also via UPS ground, arrived on February 6.  Someone back there either doesn't know what they're talking about, or they don't what they are doing - or both.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Never guessed the ending, was quite the rollercoaster. And who can you like in this case of characters? Well told story, couldn't put it down.
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I liked other mahjong games and this is no exception. I just wish I had new glasses since some pieces are sooo alike. But this game is good.
B00AHTYI5M|5.0|Hate Affleck's politics, but love his work.  I'm a long time movie fan.  Ben Affleck is probably one of the best<br />directors to come along in 50 years and he's a far better actor than he has ever been given credit for.  Odd to<br />think about.
B007FY9ZWI|5.0|This app says exactly what it describes I didn't think it was going to be able to pull all of my music together but it did and I very much appreciate it!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|I have not cared for the politics and grandstanding surrounding the killing of OBL played out in the media.  But being an advocate and supporter for our troops, I was interested in the historical facts surrounding this important and highly successful mission accomplished by America's best and bravest.  This book did not disappoint.
B004S5FWEC|4.0|Great book fast paced very clever thoroughly good read. Thought it an in testing look into the US Secret Service.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Love it, so much fun, I assumed it would be like good old Space Invader's, but in my own opinion I think it's much better.
B001ANSSDC|4.0|I enjoyed the mystic of what he had done so very wrong to end up as he did, and the interaction with his dysfuntional new freind.
0062014536|4.0|The Story:<br /> The prior books both had heart-wrenching endings that left me downright angry it was over and I'd have to wait for the next book to be released. I have been looking forward to this last installment and couldn't wait to dive in once I had it in my hands, overall I was not disappointed.<br /><br />In Requiem there are dual point of views: Lena and Hana. Both stories were equally engaging and emotionally charged. Oliver wrote wonderful slow scenes that progressed the story but were also based on Lena and Hana's emotions. She also mixed in some wonderfully written action sequences that had me skimming paragraphs so I could know the outcome (then going back and reading slowly to really enjoy it). Most of the book moves at a comfortable pace and rarely was I tired of the setting or felt that the story arc was not progressing. It had a great build up to the main conclusion, weaving Lena and Hana's stories together, but when as I neared the end I began to fret that all the loose ends couldn't possibly be tied up in the few remaining pages.<br /><br />There has been a lot of talk about how Oliver chose to end the series, some people have felt disappointed and underwhelmed. I knew this going in so I believe it lessoned the blow for me. I wasn't that disappointed but I would have enjoyed more closure.<br /><br />The Characters:<br /> I was happy to delve more into Hana's story after she was cured and found that I enjoyed her story as much as Hana's. Not only was I invested in her character I was surprised by some of her admissions. And the mayor's son, Fred... what a character he turned out to be. Seeing Portland through Hana's cured eyes gave me insight into a society where love is a disease and attempted to be removed. All the cured people Hana encounters through her journey all seem harsh, rude, bitter, indifferent or downright evil.<br /><br />Lena continued to be pulled between Alex and Julian yet the romantic aspects were toned down in this book focusing more on the rebellion. I got a sense that it was so much more than just Lena's choice of men and more about the fight for the right to have a choice. I enjoyed her character growth and watching her really be capable of being a leader.<br /><br />Final Thoughts:<br /> I enjoyed the journey Oliver took me throughout the series and I was sad to see it end. Overall, I enjoyed Requiem and recommend anyone who enjoyed the prior books to pick this one up.  You might not have the exact closure you seek but I felt it was a good series ending overall.more on the rebellion.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved to read about the evalution of this couple from differant worlds as they learned to know each other. I could have done without the sex scences. I would them too repeatitive.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I bought the first book Wool on a kindle deal, enjoyed it so much I bought the omnibus so I could read the rest.  Well written, good read and and unusual story.  Quite different take on the after effects of the end of everything.  This one is worth your time and money, I don't want to write anything that could spoil it for you, just highly recommend you get it and read it.  It is a good story.
B005MYEQ4U|5.0|I really really enjoyed this movie....after going to Paris for 12 days I recognized alot of familiar places in the movie. It arrived wonderfully and on time

B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Works great on my Kindle Fire. Large screen is nice and I have not had any issues. I would without hesitation recommend this app.
B002T9H2L0|4.0|I guess that I did not read the information all that well because I was happily surprised to find not only the Blue-Ray but also a digital DVD in my order. I like the movie, actually I found it to be quite funny and for the cost I figured that I could not go wrong. The condition of both discs is great and since I got 2 for what I consider the price of one, I can lend out the digital disc but not worry about the Blue-Ray. The delivery was quicker than I thought it would be and it really was great to be able to view the movie as quickly as I did.

Also see the documentary of his career, &#34;Searching for Sugarman&#34;.<br />He was short changed in the States but the South Africans, white<br />and black, loved him. He inspired them during all those years of apartheid.<br />He is 70+ yrs old now and still lives a simple life. He could easily be bitter but is not.<br />I admire him greatly!

B005GFPZYK|5.0|Chris tells it like it is - doesn't hold back on any of his perspectives, but relates his family experience, as well.  Particularly sad since he no longer walks among us - but I think the insight he provides as to our war efforts is so insightful.

0071762345|4.0|The first thing that stands out about Likeable Social Media is how easy it is to read. The content is organized in a format that increases in detail and is laid out in a matter that flows. The more you read on the more information is built upon what you previously read. In a world that is so connected, social media is critical in business in order to reach your target consumers. As most people use social media, they may be under the impression that it is easy to use in a business sense, but this book shows that that could not always be true, and sometimes sing social media the wrong way can be very hurtful to a company.<br /><br />As far as the content goes, the book strong utilizes real world examples of both good and bad uses of social media, and the benefits or drawbacks that the use may lead to. It truly captures that multiple social media platforms can be used as a single unit for a platform to portray the overall intended brand image and voice. It is the forefront of customer interaction. With so many users on social media, the book generates advice for how to use the brand pages and accounts to properly portray your brand voice, as well as using these social media channels as ad platforms, and how to make the most out of your monetary investments should you choose to make them.<br /><br />For me, the most useful information that the book provides is how to deal with social media as a customer service platform and how to deal with customer complaints. Sometimes social media will be a platform where customers will complain more than praise, and how to deal with those complaints on the public platform can be essentially important in portraying company image. Dealing with facebook comment complaints and those on twitter is something that may seem simple, but this book provides examples where companies have failed to properly respond. Its definitely worth a read for any business small or even large that looks to utilize social media to help market and give the company some personality.

B009NQLT0M|5.0|Unbelievably quiet.  Extremely well built.  Ample spares and alternate hook - up options included.  A really impressive little piece of engineering, certainly far superior to the failed OEM fan it replaced.
B005Q1W10A|5.0|I recommend this program.  It is very interesting. The scenery is beautiful and you really believe you are there. You won't be disappointed.
1583334386|4.0|A nifty look into the mystique of one's willpower that utilizes modern psychological studies to articulate why self-control is one of the most difficult behaviors to tame and master.  This book is conveniently broken up into 10 unique sections that is patterned after the author's popular 10 week course at Stanford (Continuing Ed) and after reading through it all you most likely will not be able to kick your nasty habits out the door in one fell swoop but will at least have a better understanding on why we succumb to such weaknesses and ultimately knowing is half the battle!
B005K17RU0|1.0|Received an update to the program today. I do not like it at all. I liked the older version much better. This update is more difficult to see on my tablet than before. Hope you go back to the way it was.
0553801473|3.0|I'm still every bit enamored with the series as I have been since the first book and will gobble up every bit of story George Martin throws my way but with this most recent entry I finally felt the pangs of impatience and vehemently wished that Martin could go back and capture some of that brilliant narrative pacing he pulled off in book #3 and re-inject that energy back into the series.  PS - the Daenerys storyline is starting to bug!
B007ZXK08C|2.0|None of the characters is particularly likeable, the plot feels like it is based on too many stretches of the imagination.  I couldn't wait to get to the end just so I could stop reading it.  A shame because it started quite promisingly.
B000FC1HBY|5.0|This might be the best series of books I've ever read.  Cannot recommend them enough!!  I look forward to reading the next book!
B008D36INE|3.0|It was nothing new and out of time , this movie would be a hit 50 years ago , all you will feel about is sadness with positive little twist , the old story of love drawing in the big see of blue  , that is all about .
B000QCS8TW|5.0|Amazingly well written and unbelievable creativity.  Grabbed hold of me from the first page, and never let go!  Two thumbs way  up!
B0052REUW0|4.0|Pinker does a good job in this book of supporting his major thesis, that violence, despite all of our hand-wringing over it, has declined. I also buy the reasons he's laid out and think they are worth a great deal of thought. I would recommend this book to anyone interested in social issues and social justice.
B008Y73940|4.0|Gripping plot.  Enjoy Matthew McConaughey turning the tables on a &#34;client&#34; who thinks he's got him by the tail.  This movie is somewhat reminiscent of &#34;The Firm&#34; with Tom Cruise.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I would recommend this book to people who like books like The  Corridor. It had a very good moral and storyline that were both inspiring and interesting!! I love  it!!
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm not ruining this for anyone. Finally something you can't put down, but one that doesn't go for cheap thrills or a trite contrived plot. Just read it.
B004WESFZW|3.0|It was just okay for me.  I was wanting something with a more exciting plot, but this one seemed to be too much like too many other movies I have seen.
B003ZSI7R2|5.0|Touring all over the world. Great new band from LA. Pretty much every song is really good . It's no Hot Shot City but &#34;Nobody told me&#34; is particularly goood.
B001P06GX4|5.0|I bought this to enjoy with friends when we have them over for dinner.  They loved the game as much as we did.  They want to come back and play again with us.  A really good purchase.
0307352153|5.0|Love the way author has brought out both sides (extra/intro) in her book and explained everything with logical connections. Should be a MUST read book for everyone so people wouldn't buy into our extravert culture so easily and would understand others around them better. Specially excellent book for managers to read so they would understand their employees and would know how to motivate each one with correct methods.

B004NELBPC|1.0|Love The Huffington Post,when I could read it.When I had the standard fire,never had a problem with the app. Have had the FIre 8.9 for slightly over a month and the app has crashed again.All soloutions Amazon had me try failed the first time and I ended up ,having to do a reboot to factory settings ( which I won&quot;t do again ),tonight,they had me try the same stuff..no go..big suprise.The apps just dont seem to work with the system.Huffingon is a great app ...when it works,not sure if the fault is with them or the fire 8.9.I do know in having this less then two months,and all the apps crashing and not working....not impressed.
B004NNUZ5K|5.0|This book is a work of art.  After self learning mixing for 20 years, all my great mixes felt more like luck than skill.  I grabbed this book and read it cover to cover.  It is inspirational, educational and a great read!  Comments like \\"as everybody knows, the best processing for slap bass is that button labeled Mute,\\" happily distract you from the volume of wisdom you are absorbing.  After first read I completely re-set up my home studio based on the practical advice and completed a new mix from scratch in 4 hours.  It's transferred across to many listening sources great and this time it feels more like skill than luck, and I think it can be easily repeated.  Thank you Mr Senior!  I plan on re-reading this over and over and drilling into the sections as my practical skills improve.  So far I've only really applied the basics - their really is a lifetime of learning and experience laid out here in a very practical way.  A further great side effect is my CPU processing for the same song has dropped from maxing out at 100% to now just 25%!  What used to take many plugins on top of plugins per track I can now do with little or no effects.  With the money I saved on a PC upgrade I've already bought another (hard) copy of this book.  Now I have my new best friend within arms reach when in my studio, and another who travels with me on the road.  \m/
B009KEN87O|5.0|I didn't expect much, but this was actually pretty well done. There were<br /><br /> a few surprises that made this game better than I thought it would be.

0425252868|5.0|What can I add to the other enthusiastic reviews on this book other than to say that I loved it! This is a wonderful true story of courage, chivalry, camaraderie, loss and redemption lived out in the skies of the major theaters of conflict in the European side of WWII.<br /><br />I cannot recommend this book highly enough. Adam Makos has certainly done justice to all the major players in this incredible piece of history, most especially to the two main characters who shared 10 amazing minutes in the most horrendous conflict of the 20th century.<br /><br />Buy this book and read it!
B006MW3UZW|5.0|A breath of freshness as there are too many other shows that follow the same story line.  Desire season 4.

B004K583KA|5.0|Beethoven named Bach as the greatest composer of all time.  I believe that judment still stands.  However, it is easy to find unpleasant performances of Bach's great music.  The performances in this set of cantatas are clean, rhythmic, and exciting to listen to.  I'm taking the opportunity to listen to Bach music I've never heard before.
B0047VSW30|5.0|Great Movie to get a Feeling of what it was like to be a Scientist and a christian, who believed that Scientists were witches  and believers in god (christians) stoned Scientists to death because the people thought that the scientist were witches and worked for the devil or some stupid idea, but that is ignorance, not some new technology about how the devil may work.  The world is taught to think and believe the way that the people with the money want them to believe, and the people in power dont want people to know that there thoughts are very reactive to the basic elements, water for example.  AS soon as some one doesnt understand, they either blame god , or the devil, or choose to block it out, because the idea is so overwhealming, but the technology of the 4th century in which this movie was made was a time in the past where it was widly known that controling peoples idea of god through government was more successful that trying to control and govern people just by government itself, so the private corporations that own the goverment departments always use a persons idea of god to ultimatly control them.  this movie gives a small glips of contol and the power of truth being redistributed to the ones who seek purity, and to those who follow those who seek purity for all, without profit

B009CFZLK8|5.0|i love all of these movies and had to buy all four.  this is a classic series that should be in any movie lovers collection.
B007WFR0QS|5.0|You know, this was one of those purchases that I made based on customer reviews, and I'm glad that I did, because it's a awesome disc!  I totally loved it!  Her voice is slightly off-kilter enough to really appreciate what I heard.  She's a very talented performer and to think that she wrote those songs mean that she's been thru it and back, and coming back, she hit gold for me!  This cd was a total refreshing package and it's on replay in my vehicle now.  GO BOO!
B009CFZGFI|5.0|i love all of these movies and had to buy all four.  this is a classic series that should be in any movie lovers collection.

B00A7CF1QY|5.0|i love all of these movies and had to buy all four.  this is a classic series that should be in any movie lovers collection.  Jeremy Renner does a great job.
B0083TXXZ4|5.0|Love the gun shoots awesome and great distance. Does not come with the amount of darts to have a lot of fun so if you can get the 18 shot clips 8 of them which gives you a great advantage over your opponent's. But takes alittle while to load. Great buy.
B0094K1K42|4.0|Pretty funny, and the style was not like a typical cookie cutter comedy.  The main character seems normal enough at first, but you slowly learn she's a total wreck.  Ridiculous things happen, while not being over the top, like some movies.
B0063GORYU|5.0|it gives me exactly what I asked for. love that its free and doesn't have hidden fees. its the best spider solitaire app I downloaded. It also gives hints which is great because I'm always stuck. highly addictive
1609611543|5.0|Fantastic book.  Really explains the complex process of digestion and how all the body's system work together, which is nothing like the over-simplistic version we were taught in school.  The amount one piece of sugar raises your blood sugar will blow your mind.
B007R4ZNWW|5.0|I recently began exploring the films of Antonio Banderas and have seen the lighter, popular work and enjoy the intelligent humor in those characters very much (Zorro, Puss in Boots, Desperado.) I especially like the depth of his voice and intonation, so my first feeling when I began this film was one of disappointment when I realized it was in Spanish and I would need to read the English subtitles. This detracts from the intensity of a film for me, but from the first scene, I was surprised to find that I became unaware that I was reading subtitles. I think the visual communication and the intonations in his voice are so strong that they focused my attention and made reading the subtitles almost a subliminal action. At the end of the movie, I felt that I had fully experienced the characters' physical and facial communication even though some part of my attention must have gone to reading the subtitles. I think this was true for all the characters, but especially true for Antonio Banderas' character.<br /><br />This is a movie I will watch many times to fully understand the detail in it. It's fascinating to watch the first time, but after you finish it, you think of scenes that haunt your imagination and you want to see it again to see if you missed something, or to see if there's a deeper meaning, or to see how it all fits together.<br /><br />Having seen only a few Antonio Banderas movies thus far, I was startled at the complexity of this character. All the movies I've seen have been enjoyable and he does interesting characters with detail and intelligence, but Dr. Ledgard is absolutely extraordinary!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Omg I love this app. Its the best $7 I ever spend. I'm totally addicted to it my mom yells at me to get off of it. Totally worth $7!
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I met Marcus at a book signing, big dude and very friendly.  I was wearing my baseball cap with Vietnam Vet on it and he came right up to me to thank me for my service.  At the time I didn't know who he was, what a great young man
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I bought this book because of the high ratings.  I was a bit skeptical because I typically don't enjoy romances as much as other genres.  This book had the perfect balance of suspense, drama, and romance.  I recommend it to anyone who enjoys any of those genres.  The ending gave me chills. I don't want to give anything away, but it gave the perfect twist to the story.
B009KEN87O|5.0|FAOTD for the win on this beauty of Gem! Great Graphics, Great Retro Feel, Great controls, music and sound FX nice and mellow intense when need be, NO IN GAME PURCHASES, that I have seen. Great app, I would recommend buying even when its not free!
B00783NPVI|5.0|what happen with Breaking dawn p2 but collector's edition like this one? please!!!!<br />somebody tell me that it's coming soon :(
B00AU15HPC|4.0|songs seems to follow the theme of \\"boy, am I in the doghouse with my lady/wife\\". I like the western flavor added to my favorite Hayward song \\"Broken Dreams\\". Not quite sure yet about disco, \\"I Know You're out There.....
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Fun and allows you to care for a horse,show him and other things!! I definitely recommend it for lite kids and'm people my age 18!
B00BRUYNBE|5.0|I found out about this band like most people through their viral video of them all playing the same guitar.  I grew to like them through watching the loop covers they do masterfully, but I fell in love with the band after seeing them live at the house of blues in Houston last year.  Great energy and a wonderful sound that really comes through in this album.
B003HARV3Y|5.0|My son has watched it at least 6 times since he got it.  I watched it with him and he fell asleep and I kept watching it.
B008220C38|5.0|Glad I watched it, though as always, the book was better. Can you tell this is from an English teacher!!
0345803485|3.0|for all the hype i saw and read online about this book, it wasnt all that i expected. yes, a little out of my comfort zone, but not as pornographic as I heard/seen. A good read, page turner, yes, but only to see how it would end.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|Free' but if you don't use parent controlled. All it take is one click to get charges $4.99 up to freaking $49.99 for gems to play/purchase in the game. These game maker for kids are fraud! My 4yrs old daughter click and bam! $9.99, luckily i caught it in my email and Amazon refunded it. Uninstalled.
B0001WE6U2|5.0|Though the HB-32 is meant for the 18-70mm DX Nikkor lens, the HB 32 fits my 18-105mm nikkor lens perfectly.<br /><br />The hood snaps on easily and let's you attach uv filters & lens cap with the hood attached.<br /><br />Get the original hood! The color and style fits the Nikkor lenses better than generic/off brands. You won't be disappointed.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Totally original, great stories, characters clicked, it is a crime that so few episodes were produced.  I've always been big on Star Trek but this show would have given them a run for their money.<br /> And if you watch the short series, you have to get the follow-up movie Serenity.  It ties everything up and answers questions.
B000FCKPHG|3.0|This sounds like it has a great and logical message, but I prefer books with text to speech so I can listen in the car or while walking the dog.  I don't need a professional reader, the computer voice is perfectly acceptable.  Please turn on text to speech.
B00992CF6W|5.0|My kids play this game all the time. I don't understand why they like it so much, but they say its so fun and they sit and laugh and build and chase each other around on there tablets and kindles. I don't know anyone who doesn't like this game.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|This is the best show since LOST! I think I may like it even more :) Exciting, gripping, leaves you hanging at the end wanting more!
B004BSFC46|5.0|We all love spoiling our kids. And when you find toys that are priced well it makes it that much easier. These are made very well. They are so easy to strap on the wrist of the baby and the baby loves them. I am a fan.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|The pictures just dont do this cover justice. It fits well and all the buttons and ports are available without any issues. This cover has been in use for awhile now and still fits well and looks amazing and the lettering detail makes the cover very easy to hold onto. I feel this cover is worth every cent because its kept the kindle in perfect condition.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|so much better than the movie.  so hard to put down.  shields great light on mental illness and the required medication that goes with it.
B00B99KJR0|4.0|I'd recommend this game to anyone, it's geared to young people, but it's a great game to increase your hand-eye coordination and to recognize colors & shapes. Check it out, it's fun!
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This was my first foray into a Preston/Childs book and I found it totally entertaing.  Agent Pendergast is a very unusal and resourceful person.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great little app tells you what you need to no especially if you have no available power point whilst traveling
B00B23O96A|3.0|OK, this isn't a great record, it's not one for the ages, but it isn't bad, either. When EC released Clapton - his take on standards - a few years back, he didn't really leave his signature on the album.  Not the case here.<br /><br />Unlike Clapton, Old Sock is filled with textures of reggae throughout; something he hasn't done since his mid '70's albums. While this might be seen as Clapton 2.0 by some, this one is superior.<br /><br />JJ Cale gets your foot tappin' with Angel. Gotta Get Over would be the \\"rocker\\" with Chaka Kahn helping out. Nice vocal work on All Of Me.<br /><br />For me the standout track here is Still Got The Blues with some nice guitar work.<br /><br />Clapton's daughters provide some akward background vocal work on Every Little Thing.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|Watched online in Costa Rica.....definitely a wonder. Great actors, wonderful character development, storyline weaves its spell. Cried like a baby over Sybil and Matthew. Can't wait for Season 3.
B007L6VR12|5.0|Young love always plays out in mysterious ways. We always try to let authority not to come between each other. For two preteen lovers, their love will create a fireball of drama for a peaceful island. I've seen many of Wes Anderson's films and they've truly been enjoyable, but \\"Moonrise Kingdom\\" is definitely a one of a kind romance that would be impossible to recreate.<br /><br />The film takes place on a small New England island in 1965. We see some of the island's sights and landmarks that makes it so somberly. The story starts when one morning, a Khaki Scout troop leader (Edward Norton) discovers that one of his scouts has gone AWOL. So with the help of his entire troop and the local sheriff (Bruce Willis), they're going to find him by any means necessary.<br /><br />Later, we find our runaway boy named Sam (Jared Gilman), who is secretly meeting Suzy (Kara Hayward), the girl he's been infatuated since they first met a year ago and have been communicating in letters since. They had made a pact to meet each other and their relationship starts to become more deeper. The two make their way through rocky hills, pine tree forests, and the more they're together, the more their love grows.<br /><br />Meanwhile, the residents of the island go on a wild goose chase to find the two lovers. When Sara's parents (Bill Murray, Frances McDormand) hear about her disappearance, they are more than shocked about it. But they discover that the island people are looking, Sam and Suzy are determined to outplay they, no matter what the consequences are.<br /><br />If you're expecting a sappy lovey-dovey teen romance, well forget it. This romance is just so unbelievable and so genuine that you'll be aching to see what's next. The cast is very superb, with Gilman and Hayward that won me over, as well as small roles by Jason Schwartzman and Tilda Swinton. There are a few moments in the film that will surprise you, as well as you laugh a bit. Wes Anderson fans will call this his best, while others will call it so-so. For me, it's a romance I wouldn't mind seeing over and over again.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Anderson's take on a young love story is truly an incredible and unexpected prize.le others will call it so-so. For me, it's a romance I wouldn't mind seeing over and over again.<br /><br />Final Verdict: Anderson's take on a young love story is truly an incredible and unexpected prize.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Definitely charmed me...I want to be adopted by the &#34;Family&#34; or maybe even become a ladies maid.  I'm sure I must be a long lost cousin. Wonderful, wonderful.
B008N1V11U|4.0|the app isn't functioning as good as it did before.  most of the images became blury and the upgrades became more exspensive.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I think it is great for thinking. Having alot of fun trying to out think the dots, but it is getting harder
B0076DCT2G|5.0|Fast, current read!  Interesting, exciting, humorous.  DeMille captures you in his writing and yet brings a smile to your face with his humor.
B009KEN87O|5.0|Great game! If your a fan of classic high score arcade shooters like Space Invaders or Galaga, this game is for you!
B009KEN87O|5.0|Fast paced retro fun....brings me back to my Atari days!  Easy to glide my spaceship around....rather addicting as well, can't wait to see what the next level will offer.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|The quality of the cast is way above average.  The age group is my own age, so I loved the story line.  I would watch anything with Judy Dench in it!  The photography of the Indian people and the streets and homes were done so well.
B000SEI230|5.0|All Nicholas Sparks books are very good.  I can count on them to have a good story and not be filled with garbage.
0452295548|4.0|My only reservation is that she is  trying to describe a &#34;spiritual psychological&#34; in her scientific brain systems, terms that are familiar to her and her discipline.  She is still within the &#34;box&#34; of scientific brain theory explanation.....and does not appear to  accept the spiritual experiences that are taking place outside her box of understanding.  She appears not to accept the reality of a &#34;spiritual heart-experience&#34; which is unexplainable and &#34;Known&#34; in and of itself.  I loved the reading and the insights she presents, but I feel she doesn't allow her analysis to be lead by her &#34;heart.&#34;  Being (&#34;flowing&#34;) as part of the universe is a larger experience than just the right brain processing.  It does provoke insightful thinking, and wells up hope.
B0077EBWVI|4.0|Very good remake of the original version and current for todays teenagers etc. Good story line, different from the original.
B002UM5BXW|5.0|A great read, this book is an entertaining look behind the scenes of your favorite restaurant, and the sociopathic crew therein.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|This is the best book of the Hunger Games series. There are some great parts that you don't want to stop reading and there are some parts that sometimes you just want to return the book because you don't like those parts and you start to hate the book but trust me it just keeps getting better.
B00AHSIQWE|5.0|I classify each of Nolan's Batman movies as a &#34;separate entity.&#34;  Each movie was so different from the other, but incredible in its own way. I love how Nolan kind of left the ending &#34;open&#34; for other directors to continue with the Batman series.<br /><br />Christian Bale is so talented and was the best Batman thus far---he truly becomes the character and embraces every single aspect of Batman's struggle as the man behind the mask. (Not to mention, I love Christian Bale and have ever since I saw him as child in Newsies :))<br /><br />I would definitely recommend this movie---it's the perfect &#34;date night in&#34; movie--My husband and I saw the first two in the theater and unfortunately were not able to see this last one in the theater, so we rented it from Amazon and watched it via our Roku. It was awesome. Definitely a series that carries a little something special between the two of us---it started out as &#34;our little series&#34; and we were able to see it through, together.

B009KEN87O|5.0|Great retro feel/look to this Space Invader like shooter! Love the updated twists! Has been a while since I've played, forgot about collecting the stars &amp; power ups the first round... Fun time waster, very simple &amp; enjoyable! Great FAOTD :)
B0074VTHKM|5.0|This is by far the best in its series although I like it more than all the others in the series
B004LUS390|5.0|*please see update added for FAOTD 10/25/13*quick FYI to start: there are some one star reviews about an update making this useless in the kindle fire but another update fixed that. WORKS JUST FINE ON THE KINDLE FIRE. no question this is my favorite drawing app I have. except for a volor book app for the kids all the rest are now sitting in the cloud. there are several choices not only for pen/pencil/brush types but also for sizes and textures. as far as color choices: endless. the way that the  color customizing works there isn't a color you can't find. you can customize with red/yellow/blue scale and/or use the color wheel to find yhe exact shade you want. you van save any customized colors for easy access later on. without a doubt my favorite feature is the dual paper thing. imagine a drawing with a clear/see through paper on top. this enables me to take my drawing and,  if I want to add something but am unsure as to the effect or whether I will like it or not, I can try it out first on that see through paper type option. if I like it then add it to the original an if not just delete it. LOVE IT!!!! there is an option for a mirror effect (whatever you draw on one half of the paper is automatically mirrored on the other half.<br /><br />there was obviously a lot of thought and care for the app and the customer put into this sketchbook and for only $1.99 it's definitely a bargain.<br /><br />UPDATE FOR FAOTD 10/25/13: there have been quite a few changes since I placed this review. there have been several of the pen/pencil/brush styles added, including texture ones like newspaper print (black dots), outdoor stuff (leaves, grass, wood, flowers), bubbles, google eyes, metal, spine (yes, backbone), rainbow, bamboo, people figures (kid swinging, man with umbrella, parent with child to name just a few), animals (butterflys and bugs), quote bubbles, arrows, checkmark and \\"no\\" sign. there is a pop-up menu where you can put your most used brushes and colors. there is an additional way to choose your color. now you can use the wheel with customizer, but you there are two different panel color charts to choose from. if you use the above mentioned dual layer technique you can use more than one at a time. each update just adds so much more to this already wonderful and fun app. it continues to be my favorite drawing app, and I'm quite sure you will enjoy it very much.itional way to choose your color. now you can use the wheel with customizer, but you there are two different panel color charts to choose from. if you use the above mentioned dual layer technique you can use more than one at a time. each update just adds so much more to this already wonderful and fun app. it continues to be my favorite drawing app, and I'm quite sure you will enjoy it very much.
B0063M22QO|5.0|I already enjoyed playing mahjong on the computer so when I saw this for kindle of course I had to have it.
B009EEFTMC|2.0|This game would be fun if you could actually play it.  After touching a few cubes the graphics go wild and you get a bright blue strobe light flashing with some lines it.  The origin of the strobe light changes as you attempt to touch different areas of the screen.  Makes it difficult to see the cube and you are unable to continue the game.
B007HC3LHS|5.0|This was a great book. It was everything you look for in a book. It was a great read and I would lime to read more books like this!
B00122HT04|5.0|I gave this album 5 stars because I love every song on it! I was just introduced to the band and I'm really surprised I didn't listen to them a LONG time ago. I would recommend this to anybody who just loves hard rock. It was a great buy!
0399215980|4.0|Bought it and was a little disappointed with its size. It fits in the palm of my hand! The content is what earns it 4 stars.
B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Great movie for family night. My boys loved this movie. We will watch it again, definitely! I would recommended this movie to our friends who have kids. Thanks!
B00A9C3RNQ|2.0|I had high expectations for this movie, given the cast, but was very disappointed in it.<br /><br />In particular, the writers seem to have no clue about their subject matter - the couple portrayed is from an era at least 40 years out of date, the location in Maine shows a relative ignorance of the place, and there is lack of continuity in the development of the plot and the characters.<br /><br />How else could you make Meryl Streep, Tommy Lee Jones and Steve Carrell all seem so one-dimensional when you know they're capable of so much more?<br /><br />If you're looking for quality entertainment, I recommend putting your hope in something else.
B000X3KZVI|5.0|If you like Mariah Carey you'll love this Adventures of Mimi (Exclusive 2 DVD Set), awesome deal and great show!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I have to admit that I cringed a little when I saw that this was the free app of the day. But, I downloaded it anyway and after a few plays I have to say that this is truly retro done right. It is as fun as I remember the old games being. It used to be about gameplay, not graphics because they didn't really have a choice. Memory was a limitation, processor speed was a limitation, rom space was a limitation-- you name it, when it came to the technicals it was a limitation. But gameplay and imagination were never a limitation. This game really feels like a classic in that regard. I enjoy it and I thank Amazon for making it the free app of the day and I thank the developer for making it. 5 stars.
B00364K6YW|5.0|Colin Firth is the ultimate Mr. Darcy. Everytime I re-read this wonderful book I now picture him.  All the acting was great.<br />What can you say..it's Pride and Prejudice....it's Jane Austen.  The BEST!
B0084IG7KC|5.0|We like it more every time we watch it.  It's such an unusual story.  I've read the books and can't wait for the rest of the movies to come out.
B004SIP7AS|5.0|Beautiful version. Gwyneth Paltrow was wonderful. I do prefer Jonny Lee Miller as Mr. Knightly from another version but just my personal preference.  Emma is just fabulous in any age or version.
B005K17RU0|1.0|put it on my kindle an can not pull it up . network connection error.<br />it reads unable to connect to server,please check your network connection
B004DI7HZ6|1.0|Cheese. I made it through thirteen percent, and will not be continuing. The author beat me over the head with how ravishingly good looking, how impossibly brilliant and wealthy the vampire is. By happy coincidence, the leading lady is gorgeous, a genius, and one of the most powerful witches that he has ever seen. This book has a four star average, as of this review, and I have no idea how. I'm sad that the publisher will view my purchase as support for this type of writing, and have posted my first ever book review with hopes that they will see it. If you like semi believable characters, stay far, far away from this.
B002RVCD6O|4.0|One of the better storys in the book series only wish they had more details and some extras at the end of the movie.
B00BQPEIT2|4.0|it has good scenary and doesnt lag. the only thing is i wish there were other characters. this game is awesome.
B005H9B44A|2.0|Loads of talent and not much else.  The story was pretty thin, wish they could have fleshed out the charaters more, esp the man who assited Natalie Portman's , Jane.  Its implied a sequel, but, not sure if I want to pay movie prices.  Then again, if you just want to watch it for Thor, then yes, he is pretty cute.
0425263908|4.0|More like 3.5-4 stars. Story is formulaic... Forbes 25 richest man, alpha male personality, handsome and irresistible meets girl. But girl is strong. Eva is honest, perceptive, knows her faults and her insecurities and becomes the compass for Gideon Cross. This is my first Sylivia Day book. Ms Day writes well and her dialogue reaches deep sometimes. I will definitely check out more of her books.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Vary good port only one thing wrong creepiest spawn during the day a minor complaint but who cares aside from that a vary good MC port
B000001FDK|4.0|Show is a little dated and flimsy story but the music is still lots of fun.  Brings back lots of memories!
B005JR3Y5W|5.0|The new Ross & Rachel or Sam & Diane. Love this show! Great writing and quirky actors. So happy it got picked up for its 3rd season!
B00A80SHFM|4.0|Why in the world is there no Do You Hear the People sing??? It is a classic song and I was beyond disappointed when I realized it wasn't there!<br /><br />  Other than that, I LOVE LOVE LOVE the rest of the album!!
0345529057|5.0|this is a great value if you want to read all of the books to go along with the hbo series.
B00BF11STU|4.0|This is not a perfect movie, but it is certainly well written and executed. If you google various events mentioned or portrayed throughout the film, it seems to hold a lot of water factually (unless you believe google is a partisan plot against conservatives and/or believe fox news is journalism).<br /><br />The amazon video player was horrible. Not only did it stop randomly, but it also couldn't remember where it fumbled. Netflix player is much much better, which is sad.
B008AT9XOC|4.0|movie came in well packaged and no problems.  movie works with no issues and my son loves the movie which is the most important thing.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|Today, amidst the self-publishing and reality-show world we live in, this is one of the best books I have read in a long time. &#34;Modern Classic&#34; is a true statement - it is perfect in every way. Loved it.

B004GHNIRK|5.0|I've enjoyed Les Mis each time I have read it.  Well, not really enjoyed it because I hate the misery and the ending.  The humanity and the failings stir emotions and resolve as deep on my fourth reading as atthe first.  But I have been challenged and stimulated by Hugo's amazing work.  The electronic version has allowed me to read it in the moments in my day when I otherwise would be spacing.  Great experience.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|very entertaining. graphics and horses are realistic. great game for any horse lover. love all the different competitions. wish it was easier to get gems
B001YV502C|4.0|Bought this as a gift.  My brother in law says its a good movie
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Love, love, LOVE Temple Run 2. I haven't tried the original game, but this is SO much fun. It's straighforward and easy to understand, and even my 4 year old can play, and have fun. Highly recommended.

I am also usually a little unsure about buying \\"greatest hits\\" compilations from bands because often some of their best songs are left out in order to make room for the ones that got the most airplay.  I am not trying to be a music snob but when I think of some of the bands that I really like and I wonder which of their songs would make it to a greatest hits cd I usually wind up with several of their truly best songs which wouldn't make it because they are not as well known.  Oddly these are always the songs from a band that I want the world to hear.  Still, with all of that said I bought this album and have not been disappointed.  How can you be when you are talking about Guns & Roses?  If you are already a fan then there is not much that I can say that you do not already know.  If you are checking them out for the first time I would say that they were one of the most talented and influential bands to come out of the late 80's.  They are often credited with killing or helping to kill (along with so-called \\"Grunge\\") the \\"hair band\\" or \\"glam rock\\" eras.  Actually none of this is true the world was ready to move on from that anyway. But they did help bring the music industry back to real, substantial \\"rock-n-roll\\".  I guess I should thank them for that.  Anyway if you want the most popular cross section of their work and some of their truly best songs I would say buy this album.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Bones season 7 was really good.  It arrived on time and was packaged good.  I would recommmend this to a friend
B008JOK59K|3.0|Sorry but I have to side with the \\"middle of the roaders\\" on this one.  Really, I am sorry because I was hoping for something great.  I have been a big fan of The Gaslight Anthem for a couple of years now and I have bought all of their previous albums and their lone EP and have not been disappointed with any of it.  I even had the pleasure of catching them live and they were amazing.  I am a little disappointed in this album though.  I would say half the songs are really good (the first three and \\"Howl\\") but even those songs are a bit of a departure from the sound and songwriting they crafted in their earlier work.  Being from NJ I kind of connected more to their earlier music.  It seemed more personal, like they were writing songs about experiences they had been through and people they had encountered and they were letting the listener in on their world.  This album does not strike me the same way.  The songs seem more like generic stories \\"created\\" about the outside world.  Its still good music but not the same connection I had hoped for. I remain a Gaslight fan and await (with anticipation) their next Endeavour.
0201626632|5.0|A PhD Is Not Enough: A Guide To Survival In Science is a very useful book for those in a graduate program. The examples are Brief, explicit but sharp. A disadvantage is the print quality than needs to be improved. Thank you!

B00BSBT8M6|3.0|The movie as a whole made me think of the movie Cast Away with Tom Hanks since it was mostly about Pi's survival on the ocean.  Was a pretty good movie that left you wondering at the end which of two stories was the true story.....

B00AHTYI5M|2.0|IT IS DIFFICULT FOR ME TO UNDERSTAND HOW THIS MOVIE WON THE ACADEMY AWARD FOR BEST PICTURE.  WHETHER VIEWED AS A DOCUMENTARY OR ENTERTAINMENT, IT SUCKED!
B009KEN87O|5.0|I'm not a big gamer but there was a time when I enjoyed going to the local arcade.<br /><br />Without a care in the world ( I had no idea! ) I indulged in the great games of the times. I remember those times as innocent and lots of fun. Voxel, not only takes me back to a more simple time, it does so very, very well.<br /><br />I think it's a fun and flawless game that I would have paid for gladly. ( I'm happy it's free though! :) )<br /><br />To the designers: ROCK ON!
1451613512|5.0|THIS BOOK IS A REALISTIC PERSPECTIVE OF THIS NATION'S HISTORY,  A FAR CRY FROM THE TRADITIONAL FLAG-WAVING, XENOPHOBIC JINGOIST NARRATION.
B009KEN87O|2.0|is sorta fun at first then the problems start... first the sound effects and sound track is bad. Second,  the mode it jumps to for a &quot;fighter&quot; style simulator is dumb and the controls are clunky. After level 3 it just becomes the same junk over and over again. really can't improve on Space Invaders that much without just ruining the game.
0618918248|3.0|Dawkins has a few good arguments like the God of gaps that is if you believe everything he is telling you. He tries to go into philosophical arguments and does a pretty bad job. The argument of who created the creator i mean really. something has to be eternal and the universe is not.
B004OZZ624|4.0|The movie started off a little slow but really picked up in the middle. Exciting ending. It is worth watching.
B004MC0FO8|4.0|I love knowing the names and artist of the old songs when they come on the radio.  We have had fun at parties with this.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Fun game! Standard match 3 with a storyline. It's easy to spend hours playing &amp; not notice the time! It's nice to replay levels too for a better time score.
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|This is by far the best TV Show ever produced. The theme, the period, the settings, the costumes and by far the best end amble cast ever put together. Each episode draws you in deeper and deeper.
B004A8ZWSS|4.0|Enjoyed this for what it was and for the setting. Kind of a bigger-than-life, hard-to-take seriously spy/intrigue plot set primarily in Venice. Played perfectly by Angelina and Johnny, it was entertaining and distracting. Can't forget the plot twist at the end and all the Venitian footage which reminds me why I have visited and revisited Venice and never tired of it.
B0088W4YTK|5.0|i loved this program and don't know why it ended. This is the best of the star gate series collection.
B009KEN87O|5.0|I never was one for old school shooters, I always found them frustratingly hard.  But the drag around control scheme on this makes it easy and so smooth to control.  Enjoying the heck out of this one.

B008HK3XKO|5.0|This product works really well for my kindle fire HD.  I doubt it's tough enough to withstand dropping it but it will keep my kindle from getting scratched in most cases I'm sure.  And the stand function works pretty well so far too.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|This isn't the normal type of literature I choose, but I enjoyed this. Very well written in stream of conciousness.
B00B10GYZ8|4.0|Anthony Hopkins portrayal of Alfred Hitchcock is wonderful. He even gets the lips right! The story is mainly about the filming of Psycho, which was a bit of a disappointment as I had hoped to gain a little more information about the man and the making of more than one of his films. But I did enjoy it. I never knew how much of a womanizer he was, or that his wife played such a key piece in his work.
0425252868|5.0|I learned details about the war on the German side I did not know for example, the Nazis was a term introduced to the Germans by the Americans during the occupation. The Germans referred to them as &#34;The Party&#34; or the &#34;44%&#34;. The narrative is well written and moving. I cried at the last part. I have never done that before. I have Steinoff's and Galland's book. This is a must have in your WWII library.
B009FZFONO|3.0|I'm super tired of the &#34;Governor&#34; story. It's time to move on. I'm disappointed about this season. Not enough scary stuff!

0786962984|3.0|I like all parts but the cards in game are cheap and small. It is weird using my hands of 40 years to play with the kids showing them how to play with small cards. Some are already missing after playing with the game. It gives kids a chance to learn on there own the plan of stratagy  of what they want to try in the game. Kids enjoy this after I show them how. Cause they don't read yet very well. We all love treasure. But this game may lose fun when the small pieces go missing. 4 different classes to try to keep alive and win. Cooperative is I good idea to use so everybody wins. Solo is possible but I ran two different classes at the same time to get more fun from the game. I tried one character solo witch is possible but can get boring. But you may play 6 at one time solo but I did not try that. This is playing with others and waiting your turn and adding the dies rolls to attack monsters. Very clean add simple for kids to learn and follow after I showed them how to play. Nice game about average play and fun. But cheap cards with nice art work and color.<br />Good game board. Lots of fun with two to four players but can be played 1  to  8 players. Record all the cards so if you lose them then you can replace them with the data recorded if you feel the need.  Happy dungeon hunting!!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It sucks you have to read the whole book before getting your word instead of looking the word up on google. ITS STUPID I wouldn't even rate it one star but I have to.
B009YP9L7U|5.0|I loved it! Kept me wanting more, I'd like a sequel. I've told a lot of people about the book and they even loved it
B003P2WO5E|5.0|Possibly the best fantasy book I've ever read. If you love long fantasy novels (as I do) then you should read this one. I loved the fact that when I got to page 900 I still had 500 pages to go.I am currently reading the kindle version and loving it. Everything about this book is fantastic!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved the book thought it was excellent couldn't hardly put it down I can't wait to read the other to and watch the movie there wasn't anything I didn't like about the book except for it ending I wanted to keep reading haha didn't want it to be over I would recommend it to all my friends and anyone that enjoys a good book it keeps you wanting to read more and know more I'm ready for book number two.
B001R10BMS|5.0|Reason why I bought from amazon because in Australia it not available in the Australian Markets. I seen Never Say Never again on TV.  I liked a lot. This was the first time I got on DVD. Learning the remake & all those extras. Sean Connery is the most favourite Bond.
1451695187|3.0|I am heartened, encouraged and a whole bunch of other positive feelings because he wrote this down. Faith is, for me, indescribable.  I'm a believer, but I've never been able to tell anyone how I just KNOW there's a God.  But hope, that's something we can all relate to, when we have it and when there's an absence of it.  For me, having a scientist agree with both faith and hope was more than uplifting.<br /><br />His descriptions of the medical parts resonated for me more strongly than his descriptions of his actual out-of-body experiences.  I realize that he was brave for even trying to put down in words feelings and intangibles. I'm glad he wrote this, but, as with most stories I've read about people going toward the light and the calm and the serenity that comes as the spirit departs the body, I think it's almost too specific to that one person for me to enter into it with him.<br /><br />What I take away is assurance that such states exist, that this scientist cared enough, believed enough to tell us about it. The book is strong and memorable for me in the layering of both faith and hope on top of his intellect and training.

1451695195|5.0|Because Eben is an MD and neurosurgeon, this book had much credibility with me.  I read it twice, 4 months apart.  Beautifully written, honest in every way, moving, and profound in that it reinforced my spiritual beliefs about God being already within us and that our universe is only one of many.  It gives all of humanity hope that we are loved and that we need not fear death. But we seldom get in touch with God's love nor deal with the fact that God is within us here on Earth.<br /><br />No religion exactly captures this essence so if you expect Jesus or Mohammed or Buddha to appear you will have to deal with that the best you can. The message is to seek to be loving and compassionate while here, and that there is nothing to fear in death.  That is a big order, but if we all tried, imagine what the world could be.<br />Stephen M Pauley MD
B007IK44CK|2.0|The franchise, and Cruise himself, should be retired at this point. Or maybe it is just a bad combination at this point and both sides should explore new options?
B00AZNEW5G|4.0|Controversy is the main reason this film garnered so much attention in and out of the theaters. Controversy and curiosity and a degree of voyeurism. It probably is important that ZERO DARK THRITY was made: the film does help assuage the anxiety that tore through this country following the infamous 9/11 and subsequent acts of terrorism and if it helps bring closure to that decade of fear and loathing that intervened before the ultimate capture and killing of Osama bin Laden then it is worth placing before the public. By definition, the movie is 'a chronicle of the decade-long hunt for al-Qaeda terrorist leader Osama bin Laden after the September 2001 attacks, and his death at the hands of the Navy S.E.A.L. Team 6 in May 2011.'<br /><br /> Many aspects of the action that takes place through this nearly three hour long film is unexplained: the meaning of the title of the film we can look up as `\\"ZERO DARK THIRTY is a military term for thirty minutes after midnight - as well as code for \\"under the cover of darkness.\\" It is also the time that the Navy Seals helicopters took to the skies on their mission to eliminate the world's most wanted man [Osama bin Laden]. Finally, it serves as a metaphor for the decade long, relentless pursuit of Osama bin Laden\\". Mark Boal wrote the screenplay for director Kathryn Bigelow and together they condensed activity of 10 years well. The cast is uniformly fine (it is interesting that very few critics singled out the astonishingly credible performance of Reda Kateb as Ammar, the brutally tortured focal point of the film's interrogation techniques) and of course Jessica Chastain manages to make us understand the obsession of Maya as the almost solitary person who insisted on finding and killing bin Laden. She plays the CIA operative whose first experience is in the interrogation of prisoners following the Al Qaeda attacks against the U.S. on the 11th September 2001. She is a reluctant participant in extreme duress applied to the detainees, but believes that the truth may only be obtained through such tactics. For several years, she is single-minded in her pursuit of leads to uncover the whereabouts of Al Qaeda's leader, Osama Bin Laden. Finally, in 2011, it appears that her work will pay off, and a U.S. Navy SEAL team is sent to kill or capture Bin Laden: only Maya is confident Bin Laden is where she says he is.<br /><br />The others in the cast are also excellent - Jason Clarke, Kyle Chandler, Mark Strong, Jennifer Ehle, Harold Perrineau, Mark Strong, James Gandolfini, Stephen Dillane, Joel Edgerton et al - but the problem this viewer has with the film is that the characters never become identifiable people and remain tropes. Another problem with the On Demand version and the DVD is that on a small screen the dialogue I so covered with extraneous noise and overlapping of lines that subtitles become necessary - and they don't function! The film is far too long (acknowledging that part of the director's intent was to show how LONG 10 years of hunting was) and it is only in the last hour that the movie `catches fire' and hold our attention.  Time will likely allow us to know if people who watch this confusing and interminable study of the decade of pursuit will understand it. The film does place before our eyes some of the uglier aspects of war (on both sides) and it is well to be reminded of that aspect of our endless unwelcome presence in the Middle East.

B005721Y7Y|5.0|This really is one of the new classics.....so original and the acting, well, you just can't say enough great things about the acting. You won't find a better movie in terms of acting quality, story complexity, and just overall style. This movie has it all. Don't miss it!!!!
B0079KGAOY|5.0|Awesome!  very glad i found this collection, especially on blue-ray. It doesn't get any better than this, Mel Gibson & Danny Glover are amaizing together.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It is one of my favorite apps. There is nothing to it. Definitely worth the 7 $. It is extremely fun. I recommend this to everybody with enough money. If you have enough money, then buy it! If you don't, then get the money! You should play it! It's a great deal so get it!
B002DQDV6Y|4.0|My daughter liked these movies and so we all watched and enjoyed them. I'm 66 and Husband is 72 and we still enjoyed!

B009E3EY38|5.0|Led was and will ever be the greatest rock band, as the Beatles was and will ever be the greatest pop band !! This performance from 2007 showed that no other band from the 70´s, less yet form the 80´s, 90´s and 2000´s will ever reach such an energy and sound! Great musics, great performance!! Thank you Plant, Page, Jones & Boham (even being the son)!

B0067R0APK|3.0|Though the new version of the app with a UI (User Interface) redesign looks wonderful, there is an issue with the radar on my phone (Samsung Galaxy S2 running Cyanogenmod 10.1).  On my phone, the radar image/map never loads, it just says grey.  On my Kindle Fire (Original) the map comes up right away as it should.  Fix this flaw, and then it will be a five star app.<br /><br />I find the new UI easy to navigate, and appreciate the clarity of how the information is presented.  Though I have previously used WeatherBug on my phone, I plan on switching to AccuWeather once the radar glitch described above is resolved.  I've tried clearing data and re-installing the app on my phone, but it is still not working.

B00A81MV3U|5.0|went to the movies today and this is what we saw---kinda slow in beginning. Not sure what was wrong with Bradley Cooper and his goofy behavior---we both were crying when the movie ended.....a good cry and perhaps a happy ending
B0052UYJDC|5.0|I've read other minimalist books and this gets me even more excited about the topic. She has a way of expressing everything and positively motivating you.
B007EZJKS2|5.0|I'll start with a negative, but it turns out that I enjoyed it so much more even taking that into consideration.<br /><br />It was not clear to me when I bought this that it was the graphic novel version - if I had taken the time to review the comments, I could have seen that - but it wasn't really pointed out in the general description. I had been hoping for the normal novel, but that's not available for the Kindle yet, as I found out later.<br /><br />That said, this is such an amazingly crafted book. It's a collection of 6 comic-style issues bound together, including the original covers. The artwork comes from several very talented artists. This was my first experience with the story and I just love it. It's beautiful and thought provoking and entertaining. As long as you know what you're getting into, I'm sure you'll be enthralled by the unicorn and her quest to find the others of her kind.

B0090CVJZ4|5.0|Trying to connect wires to the back of a 7.1 surround system including wiring from multiple rooms can get messy and complicated quickly.  These plugs do the job.  The screws make it convenient to attach bare wires.<br /><br />Also, it is nice that the screw ends are properly beveled instead of sharp.  (Note: sharp screw ends can scratch the copper coating on speaker wires or even cut the wires, so the bevel is important.)

B00BMVTS1S|5.0|As always, Peter Jackson delivers on an already successful trilogy and fantasy adventure...Having read the Hobbit ( 3 times ) back on the early 70's I was truly captured by how I imagined this story would be depicted in a movie setting...To those unfamilure with JRR Tolkien's masterpiece, I highly suggest you read it before casting an opinion on this movie take, YOU can't look at it as a simple fantasy / make believe movie, rather so find it as the pinicle of what the Hobbit was truly meant for, a story meant for all time! Easy 5 star rating, IT LOOKED Awesome on Hi-def and the sound track was off the charts! ( my playback is 7.1 )
B009R5GR1K|4.0|I am very satisfied with this purchase.  I've used it many times since buying it.  Good as an &#34;on the go&#34; reference.  I'm purchasing one for my granddaughter, who's constantly asking me, &#34;grandma, what does ------- mean?&#34;
0451205766|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone who liked the movie or wants to know more. There is so much more in the book that's not in the movie. I liked how it explains why things happened the way they did. The movie seems more like a quick summary of the story. Ordered the last don and the Sicilian by Mario Puzo because I enjoyed the godfather so much.

B00B5A9FOG|3.0|I am in total agreement with the reviews of this season, when it was advertised as the final season i was very shocked, how are they going to fit everything they promised into one season ? Well i have developed a deep love of this series and am totally DISGUSTED with the writers... It still has Arthur as a person incapable of taking care of himself and Merlin as basically his slave, NOT the great people they should have become. It was actually like watching a rerun of earlier seasons just actors portraying different positions. What has happened to Kilgharrah ? The White Dragon ? Where is the story line of legend ? Come on writers and producers, WHY HAVE YOU DONE THIS TO YOUR LOYAL FOLLOWERS ? ? ?

There is high replay value in this game so I advise you most definitely to get it if you are considering.

B006LSZECO|5.0|This started off with an annoying narrative style. Especially the diary entries, which read like a Sex & the City script. But once you find out what's REALLY going on, holy crap! And the twists keep coming and the conniving and back-stabbing never stops and it's truly awesome. Other reviewers didn't seem to care for the ending because it was \\"unrealistic\\" but a realistic ending would have been a predictable one and who the heck wants that? Great read.

B00BP4WAZS|5.0|Every detail was thought about on this movie. Loved the concept. There are a lot of subtle things that really make it great.
B00B1E6FF8|3.0|I waited for this film with some anticipation and sadly was disappointed with the final product. I love Jessica Chastain, she a wonderful young actor, but her role was flat. Her character shows no meaningful development our growth over 10 years. She is static.<br /><br />Seconly, as many have reported, the film seems to suggest the enhanced interrogations, aka torture, directly lead to UBL. A highly disputed premise. None of us, or few, will every really know to what extent these methods played in the final result, but the film just glosses over all the other methods employed and all the other US and foreign assets who risked life and limb, or died to fulfill this mission.<br /><br />On the realism vs. hype department... please an Agency Station Chief who walks around the pubic lobby of an embassy wearing a CIA lapel pin? Something I've not ever seen nor could imagine. The SF guys were played to the worst high-fiveing, knuckle bumping stereotype. HUA!<br /><br />And finally, not to sound unpatriotic or in anyway down play the actions of DEVGRU, they are awesome and we all owe them and their brothers on the other teams and all the members of the SF community a lifetimes worth of gratitude. But that said, on this mision, outside of the very real threat of Paki interference, they faced a pretty soft target. A total of 3 adult male combatants, 1 of whom was armed vs. 2 sticks of special operators.. and a bad ass dog. The Tuson PD HRT has gone up against harder targets. The Mayor of San Diego is better protected. And its not a stretch to say that the SEALS and all the other SF community faces much higher threat encounters in Afghanistan every single day. Yes UBL was enemy numero uno, but lets put this actual mission into perspective.<br /><br />With regards to \\"winning\\" the WOT, this film was almost silent on the day in day out grind of the diplomatic soft power, USAID, firefights, HUMIT, signals work and yes targeted drone strikes that have actually turned the tide of battle in our favor.

This is a movie I could watch again and again. The musical scores and singing is so wonderfully done. The plot is beautiful, and I so enjoyed watching the progress of a phonetics master take on the biggest challenge of his life, by converting a poor girl right off the streets of London into a lady of society. I'll always recall the names of Eliza Doolittle and Henry Higgins (much more fondly called 'enry 'iggins!) forever, fondly.

0060558121|3.0|This book is difficult for me to describe.  In keeping somewhat with the character of Shadow, I see this book as merely existing until fairly close to the end when it comes alive.<br /><br />If you choose it to be, this book can be delightfully mind-blowing.  Or it can just be an interesting and imaginative fantastical story.  Or it can just be a bland bit of hopping about aimlessly from one small adventure to the next.<br /><br />I take from it: embrace the past; relish the future; live the present.  Simplistically, we are all the same yet different.  But we each, when broken down to our minute parts, are complex individuals built of our own experiences and perspectives.  Gods are in our history, present and future; they just change based on need and relevance, but never disappear because history remains a part of us.<br /><br />I liked, but not loved, this book.  I suspect, though, that this is one of those books that requires a re-visit somewhere down the road.<br /><br />Ambiguous review?  Ambiguous book merits ambiguous review.  Frankly, the reader will gain what he gains from it, and it might be something entirely different from what I did.  That said, I am glad I bought this, and encourage all to read it.

In view of the depredations of war and the crimes of cultural vandalism and theft committed in fairly recent history -- and likely to be committed in the future unfortunately - it's heartening to realize that a substantial body of law exists out there as a response internationally to preserve and protect that which constitutes cultural heritage worldwide.<br /><br />Under the able editorship of James Nafziger, an acknowledged expert in international law, this book is a collection of learned articles and essays on a wide range of matters relating to cultural heritage, from claims of ownership to crimes of theft, to mediation in disputes and so forth.<br /><br />Nafziger in his excellent introduction wrestles with the problem of defining cultural heritage, cautioning that it is subject to various interpretations.  However he feels that it's fair to say that in the narrower sense as used in this book, `cultural heritage' is limited to tangible artifacts of cultural significance, including cultural objects, sites, intangible ideas and knowledge related to such objects.<br /><br />All this could include everything from art and architecture, oral history, rituals, religion, folklore and music to digital records and of course, a great deal more.<br /><br />Published recently as part of Edward Elgar's  `International Law' series, the book emerges as quite a find for scholars, students and professionals involved in international law, and  obviously, those concerned with cultural heritage.<br /><br />Here conveniently in one handy hardback volume, are 26 articles in all, from such journals as the `Harvard International Law Journal'... `The International Journal of Cultural Property'... the `Stanford Law Review'... and `Art, Antiquity and Law'.<br /><br />The articles are grouped under such headings as: public international law, intangible heritage, private international law and dispute resolution. To cite just one example, Patty Gerstenblith's article in the Chicago Journal of International Law has a title which says quite a lot about the concerns and objectives inherent in this subject area: `Controlling the International Market in Antiquities: Reducing the Harm,  Preserving the Past.' Interestingly, there is even an article on the property rights of ancient DNA.<br /><br />As Nafzinger concludes, the intent of this edition is to create a `mosaic' of commentary and insight into the continually expanding framework of international cultural heritage law.  Practitioners of international law in general -- as well as cultural heritage law in particular -- will find this book immensely useful.  The publication date is 2012.ultural Property'... the `Stanford Law Review'... and `Art, Antiquity and Law'.<br /><br />The articles are grouped under such headings as: public international law, intangible heritage, private international law and dispute resolution.

Lemley -- Stanford Law School<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />Here's an important new legal treatise in which IP meets IT -- and which examines the linkage, between the two, of nonprofit organizations (NPOs).  Author Jyh-An Lee, who hails from  the National Chengchi University, Taiwan, explains in the preface that `intellectual commons' are intellectual resources (common to all ) which anyone can use, either without permission, or with permission granted in advance.<br /><br />It's subsequently pointed out that protecting these resources has `been one of the most important goals of recent innovation and information policies' and that `public interest advocates have also sought ways to expand access to various online intellectual resources,' in other words, the intellectual-commons environment.<br /><br />The focus of the book is on the role of NPOs in this process worldwide.  In the opinion of the author, NPOs have certain unique features that enable them `to serve important social aims that neither the private sector nor the government can adequately fulfill'.<br /><br />The author concludes that  `by clarifying the role of NPOs in correcting contract failures in the digitally-networked world, the book illustrates how the trust provided by (said) NPOs is indispensable for commons governance'.<br /><br />And here's something we didn't know: a number of `for-profit' companies including Google and IBM have, according to the author, successfully built new business models by recognizing and embracing the nature of the commons.'<br /><br />It would appear that, so far, the role of NPOs in the intellectual environment worldwide has been somewhat neglected in legal literature and it is this oversight that this book seeks to address.  In so doing, it certainly presents a dizzyingly broad and impressive range of research to substantiate its central thesis.<br /><br />There is a massive bibliography no less than nine pages long at the back of the book and an extensive index which enables the researcher to cross-refer.<br /><br />Practitioners as well as scholars and researchers in intellectual property as well as IT will appreciate the author's quite original perspective NPOs and their role in supporting the production of intellectual commons.substantiate its central thesis.<br /><br />There is a massive bibliography no less than nine pages long at the back of the book and an extensive index which enables the researcher to cross-refer.<br /><br />Practitioners as well as scholars and researchers in intellectual property as well as IT will appreciate the author's quite original perspective NPOs and their role in supporting the production of intellectual commons.
B00BUADSMQ|1.0|I've never seen a a big budget sequel to a solid series fail so badly in my life (and that includes \\"Godfather III.\\") From the director to the script to the casting to the acting, this was the most infuriatingly bad film made on this type of scale that I've ever endured. I actually went to the box office afterward and tried to get my money back. BTW, they don't do that anymore, apparently.<br /><br />This is not the tone, the style or even the spirit of the series and characters that I've come to love. I even enjoyed the last one which a lot of hardcore fans bashed. This is just a really bad movie. The director was beyond clueless. Sadly though the most clueless person seems to be Willis who okayed the script and the hiring of the director for \\"Max Payne.\\" Clearly, Willis didn't care if the film was a giant steaming present as long as he got a massive payday.<br /><br />If you love the \\"Die Hard\\" series, I urge you not to see this film. It will only anger and ultimately sadden you deeper than a film probably ever should.

It's what you might call a developed creature of the Companies Act 2006 which currently provides for just this type of procedure.<br /><br />The efficacy of such schemes has been alluded to, for example, in a case of 2001 in which the court stated that `...the utility of the statutory mechanism is particularly obvious in a case where a company is in financial difficulties, but can persuade most, but not all the relevant creditors that the company's debts should be restructured rather than that those creditors should exercise their rights, including the right to put the company into liquidation.'<br /><br />Schemes of arrangement, therefore, are aimed at achieving a compromise position which can assist a company by allowing, for example, further time to pay, rather than resorting to the blunt instrument of bankruptcy.<br /><br />In such a case, the consent of the majority of creditors (or shareholders) is required as well as, ultimately, agreement by the court, a process which can be protracted and complex.  The possible or probable benefits for the creditors in this process is at least the expectation -- or hope -- of some recompense,<br />which might be unlikely if a bankruptcy were regarded as the only solution.<br /><br />The book is distinguished for its erudite commentary, which is supported throughout by numerous references to case law.  Meticulously footnoted throughout, it provides extensive tables of cases and legislation and an extremely useful index.<br /><br />And -- as the contents are specific to schemes of arrangement, counsel involved in such proceedings can quickly turn to it for specific advice, (especially the Practice and Procedure section in Part V with its key documents list, timelines and so forth) without necessarily having to wade through the unwieldy standard texts.<br /><br />We would regard this book is one of the most valued statements available on corporate insolvency practice -- and certainly invaluable for counsel advising and/or representing corporate clients in schemes of arrangement matters at the Rolls Building.  As schemes of arrangement are now becoming (since 2006) an increasingly commonplace solution to problems of corporate debt, this book should be acquired by every corporate practitioner.

HERE'S AN INSIGHTFUL COMMENTARY ON ANTI-DISCRIMINATION LAW IN THE EU<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />We would say that for the most part, many people see the European Union as an organisation pursuing aims and objectives which are mainly economic.  But, as pointed out in the foreword of this clear, lucid and quite absorbing book on anti-discrimination law in the European Union, the EU has emerged as `an active human rights organisation - not just one which accepts that its policies and acts are subject to human rights discipline.'<br /><br />Granted, the EU is not commonly perceived in quite this light until one is reminded in this erudite volume from the Oxford University Press, that the European Economic Community from the beginning of its existence, `possessed rules forbidding discrimination, specifically on grounds of sex'.<br /><br />As we review this book, we believe that this is important to note:  `The right to equality of opportunity irrespective of sex,' say the general editors, `is fundamental to a civilized society... without it, the individual's talents cannot be exploited to the full, human dignity is compromised... inequality on the ground of sex is simply unfair.'  It's therefore not unfair to say that the principle of equal pay for men and women was the basis on which the edifice of EU anti-discrimination law was constructed.  It was there from the beginning of the European Union, and with us it remains.<br /><br />This book puts forward an eminently readable and certainly forceful examination of  -- and sustained analysis of --  anti-discrimination law in the EU in all its manifestations, which of course include nationality and sex, as well as part-time and temporary employment... racial or ethnic origin... religion or belief... disability... age... and sexual orientation.<br /><br />In providing a detailed analysis of the general principles of EU law and the key concepts which underpin it, the book concludes by examining its utility.  What, for example, are the ways and means by which individuals should ideally be protected against further discrimination, it asks... and what policies conceivably could further enhance equality of opportunity?<br /><br />In view of the recent profound changes in EU law in the area of equality and non-discrimination over the last seven years, particularly following the enactment of the Treaty of Lisbon in 2009, this new second edition is especially important to acquire.  Certainly, this book excels as a source of reference.<br /><br />Meticulously footnoted throughout, it contains extensive tables of cases and of legislation, as well as a table of treaties and conventions and detailed index. For practitioners, academics and/or government or EU officials, this book should be required reading, lending authority and weight, as it does, to any legal argument pertaining to anti-discrimination in the EU.

B004NELBPC|1.0|Can't view anything. Pop up ads have taken over the Android version on my Kindle. Re-installed to more pop up ads. Latest update has rendered app totally useless.
B00AQ71FLK|1.0|Save your time and space on your phone/kindle/tablet.  This is a memory hog!  Deleted almost all the active programs and still got a message that I did not have enough memory.  Looked interesting but if it is going to eat that much memory, I will wait for the patch.

B00BEPVAV8|1.0|slowest dune buggy I have ever witnessed!  the only thing that did work was the timer.  Went only half way around the course and ran out of time due to the constant freezes.
B005KB0SU6|5.0|Muchas gente califica este libro por ser la continuación de &#34;La Sombra del Viento&#34;, sin embargo recordemos esta es una tetralogia que se llama El Cementerio de los Libros Olvidados, este siendo el segundo libro, es una maravilla, por que sigue creando y amarrando tramas de una forma muy interesante, y si uno ve la historia completa se maravillara de la capacidad del escritor para ligar temas, tramas, personajes.<br /><br />Sugiero para disfrutarlo entonces leer toda la seria
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|Starts off slow and is dark.  The entire story is dark, but is full of duty bound characters who tell a compelling story.  The second volume is due the middle of 2013.  Can't wait.
B009KEN87O|4.0|I really like this cool app. The 3D affects are great and I really like the gameplay and design. Gives  me something to do in the evenings.
B00BF11STU|3.0|To me this is very much a documentary film featuring a series of events portrayed by what one would assume is mostly fictionalized dialog.  Supporting characters are not fleshed out and events are separated by cut scenes showing the location.  On the good note the film held suspense amazingly well given that you know. Spoiler Alert!  They get him.  Right when it is about to start running long it changes pacing (in a good way) but just the same recommend watching alone, when you have time, and are not distracted.<br /><br />Torture NOT nearly as central to the film as expected, after having heard all this noise about it, also it was WAY milder than I expected(ex. no cutting).  Overall the film is very a-political anyone claiming otherwise is blowing hot air.<br /><br />I'd rate it higher but I don't find myself with a desire to see it again.  Frankly the film is just not that deep, the characters are not very interesting, and there is nothing motivational or feel good about it.  Sigh I guess that's life.

B00846WWVM|5.0|LOVED THIS GAME, simple but challenging enough to make it fun and exciting. The various scenarios make for a great game.
B005LAIIKI|5.0|I am no movie critic or anything but rather just a dude that wanted to post a review that people can read that isn't 4 pages long. One of the only reasons I wanted to go see this movie is Leonardo DeCaprio. I really had no opinion on Tarantino, nor do I know how to spell his freaking name.. Anyways, the only QT movie that I had seen was Inglorious Basterds but loved it! I went with my girlfriend to this one, which was a bad idea because she hates violence, blood, and all of that good stuff that us men like. But she ended up even liking the movie a lot! I absolutely loved it! Besides the fact of Mr. DeCaprio having a part in it, I thought the rest of the cast nailed their performance! Christoph Waltz is absolutely amazing, one of my new favorite actors by far and is brilliant in Django! If you are a fan of QT or just good movies in general, you will love this crazy, fun, and riveting tail while on the edge of your seat! Alright, well that was longer than I wanted it to be so sorry about that.. Great movie. If you can spare 20 bucks take the opportunity. If not, rent it and see what you think.
B003MAOTP2|4.0|There were a few hiccups on the electronic delivery. I could watch this movie a dozen times and then watch it again.
B005PK56TA|5.0|Horror this day in age is rare. This was great considering it's a T.V. Show. I loved it. My husband however, wasn't thrilled about it. He doesn't like horror though. So, I don't think his option matters. :)
B00BHHIWQO|2.0|Something is clearly wrong with this app.  I didn't have trouble downloading as some people.<br />But the Facebook app syncing doesn't work, Which is why most people want this Version of the game.  My sister plays this all the time, and wants me to join her.  I keep my phone mostly for business, and so i was excited to see the chance to play on my Kindle.<br /><br />Gameplay is solid and just as good as any other platform Ive played it on.<br />Graphics are good,  Nothing amazing but they don't look stretched (Im on Kindle Fire HD 8.9)<br />Facebook Intergration is broken.<br />App interface is non exsistent.  I can't return to the main menu, I can only pause and play the game.<br /><br />Sad to see they released this, when it clearly hadn't been tested.
B0098G7AWS|5.0|By Darrell Stoddard, darrellstoddard@gmail.com<br /><br />\\"Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends.\\" In the history of the world, the best example of giving ones life to save the life of another is found in the true story of the Titanic disaster; not the OK fictional story of Jack and Rose on the Titanic, but the true historical event of so many men giving up their seats in the lifeboats to save the lives of women and children.<br /><br />Next to the story of the Titanic about people willing to die to save the life of others, is the sculpture of the \\"Burghers of Calais\\", and a 12 minute film entitled \\"Greater Love.\\"<br /><br />The story of the \\"Burghers of Calais\\" is found in a sublime sculpture by the artist Rodin  It is a monument to an occurrence in 1347 during the Hundred Years' War, when Calais, a French village was under siege by the English for over a year. England's King Edward offered to spare the people of the city if any six of its top leaders would surrender presumably to be executed. Edward demanded that they walk out wearing nooses around their necks to give their lives for their village. It is reported that they actually did this and then were spared by the intervention of England's Queen who persuaded her husband to exercise mercy by claiming that their deaths would be a bad omen for her unborn child.<br /><br />No less than the above, is the simple story told in a 12 minute film called \\"Greater Love\\" which is about a little girl who gives a blood transfusion to save the life of her brother. Believing that the transfusion would end her life, she then asks the question. \\"When am I going to die?\\"<br /><br />To give ones life to save the life of another is reflection of the Atonement of Jesus Christ who died that we might live after death. This even \\"greater love\\" that God has for his children is represented in a ten minute film called \\"The Bridge\\" which is the story of a father who operates a railroad bridge. When his little boy comes out on the RR tracks of the bridge, the father must make a decision of whether to save the people on the train (you and I and everyone who has ever lived) or to sacrifice his son. He allows his son to die for all mankind to live. \\"For God so loved the World that he gave his only begotten son...\\" Jews and Muslims relate the story to Abraham's offering his son (Isaac or Ishmael) as a sacrifice. \\"The Bridge\\" is an even better analogy and schoolmaster because no lives were being saved by Abraham's sacrifice. The film is a bridge between man and God, a bridge between our mortal life and a life after death, and a bridge between Christians, Jews, and Muslims. For these reasons, I believe \\"The Bridge\\" is the most important motion picture ever produced.<br /><br />See all of my Reviews. I write only about books, events, or motion pictures that have changed the course of history or unforgettable books or motion pictures that will totally change peoples lives.<br /><br />Darrell Stoddard, Founder - Pain Research Institute healpain.net and saveusa.bizen his little boy comes out on the RR tracks of the bridge, the father must make a decision of whether to save the people on the train (you and I and everyone who has ever lived) or to sacrifice his son.

0307352153|4.0|If you're an introvert you probably have felt shameful of it at some time or another. While it's okay to be extroverted, introverted people also have a lot to contribute to society too, and it's okay for us to be quiet, and while we may be pressured to be more extroverted, Susan Cain gives introverts plenty of reason for introverts to be proud of who they are and embrace being introverted. If you've ever been confused about your shyness, or wondered why the world works in favor of extroverts then this is a recommended read.<br /><br />Cain sets up a lot of history as far as how the turn of encouraging people to be more extroverted happened in America, and explaining how introverts do benefits colleges and work places despite their quietness. She also goes over how they feel, and how they have already impacted the world with their strengths. For anyone who has been confused, or felt a little held back by their introverted this can be an encouraging and powerful read to understanding yourself better.<br /><br />As an introvert it's always been a little tough to fit especially being on the extreme end of the spectrum of it. Even other introverts might be slightly a little extroverted in their wants. When you actively choose to participate silently though it has often proven to baffle those who have been around me. Susan Cain tries to welcome in introverts, and share a little about their qualities that make them feel a little more at ease with their world. The only thing she almost sounds a little tense toward extroverts sometimes, and a lot of the book drags with points that seem to already have been made over and over again by her.<br /><br />Each part of the book provides something insightful. If you're an introvert you might be baffled, and find comfort in how normal your personality traits are. If you're an extrovert it is worth a read to understand the introverts you probably know, as the book states there are more introverts than extroverts so there is a good chance that you do know some.<br /><br />As said though the book does tend to ramble a lot and it seems to only focus on how introverts mesh mostly in the business world. It lightly hits on introverted kids, and even babies, but the business side of it is a little dull. It's more interesting to hear about the traits that an introvert will naturally have that they put, and need to receive in order to feel comfortable.<br /><br />Susan Cain puts together a great read for people wanting to gain more insight into a personality that is often misunderstood. Introverts aren't necessarily always shy, nor are they always even quiet, but the world has given both personalities strong stereotypes that are difficult for an individual to shape themselves now if someone knows the traits of someone of those personalities and instantly meshes them into everyone of them. Cain's book gives you a lot of moments where you feel like you've finally found something relatable, and know that you aren't the only one who deals with the highs and lows of being an introvert.<br /><br />Rating 7 of 10<br /><br />This book was provided by Waterbrook Multnomah Publishing in exchange for a review.
B0034G4OXQ|4.0|This is a fascinating film that requires viewers to exercise their imaginations.  The acting is first rate.  Matt Damon and the young French woman are terrific, as is the little boy.  Three stories are presented that eventually mesh in a satisfactory manner.  The<br />initial Tsunami scenes are captivating because of the power and devastation of the waves of water.  But the story continues to<br />accelerate as we learn more about the &#34;gift&#34; Damon has, and why he considers it a curse.<br />I liked the music Eastwood selected for this film, and the clever way he uses it to highlight important scenes and moments in the film.<br />Like I said above, the film requires the viewer to stretch his/her imagination.  Once that's done, sit back and enjoy a thoroughly entertaining film.
B00BHU9DUK|5.0|I gave this film a high rating because I was totally captivated and felt a part of their make believe theatre world . Great metaphor!
B008Y1YK0I|5.0|Already a stunning classic, with impressive photography and acting, this new format adds greater clarity and definition to<br />the non Blu-ray version.  Facial features, including beards where one can easily determine shades of blacks and grays are<br />visible.  Sound is improved a bit, and colors seems to jump out and give one the feeling of being in the desert.  My one<br />caveat is that quality of the TV set used to view the film.  I've viewed the film on three different TV sets (all set-up for Blu-<br />ray) and have noticed subtle, but important differences.  I own a Vizio led 55 inch Blu-ray edge lit set and the pictures are<br />marvelous.  My nephew has an LG, and it's not as clear.  My son has a new 60 inch Samsung smart TV and the picture is<br />just slightly better than my Vizio.  So, readers should realize that the quality of the TV set and DVD player will make a<br />difference in the picture you see.
B009KEN87O|5.0|You can most likely tell how this game will play if you're an old school gamer just by looking at the pictures. Object of the game is to take out waves of oncoming ships. It can get pretty hectic, even on easy mode. The power-ups provided will aid you greatly, and there's even one that will turn the 2D field into a 3D field! Nifty! Fun game if you're into the old space shooters.
034553056X|3.0|While Grisham is a terrific writer, this is not one of his best stories.  It is a quick read, but some of his other novels are much better than this yarn.  Perhaps it is the way Grisham depicts the main character escaping from a soulless life, and finding redemption in<br />a most unusual place.  One thing he does stress in this novel is how awful it must be for a young attorney to work for a big law firm that employs hundreds, and even thousands, of lawyers..
