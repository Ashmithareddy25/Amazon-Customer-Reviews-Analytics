B008AS5UAO|5.0|Given the number of recordings available of Mozart's great masterpiece, including at least a few that come close to complete perfection, could yet another recording of Don Giovanni possibly have anything new to offer?<br /><br />That question is answered with a resounding yes only a few bars into Maestro N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin's dynamic, effusive rendition of the overture. N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin rips through the overture, and indeed most of the opera, at breakneck speed, and with absolutely dazzling results. The drama is accelerated and intensified, not only through truly remarkable and ingeniously executed tempi, but also through masterful control of the orchestra's dynamics. The textures that the maestro carefully coaxes from the Mahler Chamber Orchestra can only be described as glorious. However, with a truly extraordinary cast of world class singers, N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin's conducting is hardly the only compelling reason to own this recording.<br /><br />Amid an ensemble of world-class talent, it is the two female leads, Diana Damrau (as Donna Anna) and Joyce DiDonato (as Donna Elvira), who offer the most electrifying performances, both musically and dramatically. DiDonato's Elvira is particularly unhinged, in a truly frightening and very sad characterization that fastidiously avoids the silly, hackneyed histrionics employed so often by lesser singers in this role. DiDonato's artistic creativity seems completely unrestrained in the role, yet her characterization nevertheless remains completely faithful to Da Ponte's and Mozart's depiction of their tragic \\"donna abbandonata\\". From a technical perspective, DiDonato's performance can only be described as being virtually flawless.<br /><br />As Donna Anna, Diana Damrau brings real life and a depth of characterization to the role that is rarely seen today. Instead of the static figure so often portrayed, we get a sense of Donna Anna's humanity and her truly human desire for retribution for her father's killer. Damrau's execution of the role is technically brilliant, unquestionable affirming her credential as a master Mozartian.<br /><br />Ildebrando D'Arcangelo offers a vocally strong Don Giovanni with a deeply resonant lyric bass. While D'Arcangelo's choice to portray Don Giovanni as rather anonymous character and man of mystery perhaps comes across as being somewhat flat and unnuanced, this intentional artistic choice on D'Arcangelo's part is exactly how Da Ponte and Mozart present their anti-hero; we see nothing of Don Giovanni's inner life, and all we learn about Don Giovanni comes from his interactions with the other characters. While this dramatic approach is far more likely to succeed on stage than on an audio-only recording, D'Arcangelo's pure lyricism more than makes up for any perceived lack of dramatic flair. The unique timbre of D'Arcangelo's instrument makes it easy to distinguish between the two bass-baritone roles in the opera, Don Giovanni and his manservant, Leporello, who is sung with impeccable comic timing and skillful musicianship by Luca Pisaroni.<br /><br />Tenor Rolando Villaz&oacute;n, making his return to opera, in mostly good form, after a multiennial hiatus from performing following surgery to remove a cyst from his vocal chords, offers a rather perplexing take on the role of Don Ottavio. While Villaz&oacute;n puts in an overall solid vocal performance, his tone is a bit rough for such a lyrical role, and his legato, at times, simply doesn't seem to be there. Perhaps hoping to compensate with added dramatic oomph, Villaz&oacute;n offers up a more fiery and assertive take on Don Ottavio. This seems to be a rather confused interpretation given that throughout the opera Ottavio is passivity and impotence personified. He spends the entire opera groveling to his beloved Donna Anna and instead of doing anything himself to find her attacker. This simply dosen't fit with Villaz&oacute;n's interpretation.  While Villaz&oacute;n's presence was likely a boost for marketing and publicity purposes for Deutsche Grammophon, the recording would have been better off with any number of lesser known but more capable tenors in the role.<br /><br />I should note that this recording employs a fortepiano, rather than a harpsichord, as the keyboard instrument for the continuo. This would be less of a problem if the use of the fortepiano were limited to the recitatives. However, Benjamin Bayl's fortepiano improvisations are heard in the orchestral ritornellos throughout the opera, and to rather disconcerting effect. The next recording in this series, Cos&igrave; fan tutte, is scheduled for release in August 2013. Let us hope that Maestro N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin has the wisdom and good taste to do away with the fortepiano and the improvisations for that release, as they unfortunately mar an otherwise flawless orchestral rendition on this recording.<br /><br />The recording, which was made in a live concert performance of the opera, is of outstanding quality and is completely unmarred by audience noise or any other extraneous sounds. The recording is extremely well mastered, allowing both the vocal performances and N&eacute;zet-S&eacute;guin's brilliant conducting to be richly reproduced in vibrant stereo sound. In terms of audio quality, it is the highest quality recording of Don Giovanni currently available. Highly recommended.

0060254920|4.0|Maurice Sendak was an American original in personality and artistry. This children's book is his best known piece of art and literature. The book first is about a child, Max, who creates an imaginary world with strange monsters. Sendak has quite an imagination to create such vivid large creatures who would frighten children easily but not Max. He appears to be a lonely child with too much time on his hands.<br /><br />In this world where the wild things are, he becomes king and rules over them in his wolf costume. The book is very short, vivid, and colorful.  There is not a lot of writing here. There maybe some children readers who find the book fascinating while others might be turned off by the monsters themselves. They are not attractive friendly creatures but perhaps that is the message that physical appearances may be deceiving even Max.<br /><br />This book won the prestigious Caldecott Award for Children's Literature and has become a classic overall. It may not be for everyone even adults. Sendak was definitely creative and imaginative and talented as both writer and illustrator.

0062127241|5.0|It's taken me a while to read this book. It was given to me for Xmas as a hardback edition and being used to Kindle I found it weighty. However, it was well worth the achy wrists. Pete's own story, at last. I've read all previous books about The Who over the last forty years so it was good to get Pete's own take on things. Other reviewers have criticized the fact that there are not enough Who facts in here. Well the thing is - this is Pete's story - about Pete. Hence the title. It's good to get new stuff and not read the same old facts over and over. If you want old facts, then buy something else. There are plenty of titles available. Who By Numbers, The Who and Anyway, Anywhere, Anyhow (Complete Chronicles) To name but a few and if it's Keith Moon stuff you're looking for try and find an old copy of Moon the Loon!

There's not much new in the package, but that's just as well; I bought it for the movies on BRD, and even if there were no other features, that's reason enough to have them in my collection... again.<br /><br />If you have them in any other format, or not at all, take the plunge.

B00138J7ZC|5.0|This review is from: Howl (Amazon Instant Video) My visceral experience of this stimulating artistic masterpiece brought me images as follows:  I saw<br />Cities' clocks traffic-jammed against up tight sphinxes that blew cigarette smoke up smoldering stacks of sailors succoring third rail  subway connections for trains that never come. A sax player blows golden notes to jazzle the night skies with spinning spermatozoa exploding into curling copulations.<br />I imagine that others will discover passions unsensed before except by Whitman riding the ferry to Staten Island in \\"Leaves of Grass.\\"

B00005YUBL|5.0|This set of recordings from 1972 has been in my collection for forty years now and this latest set of remastered discs is certainly worth acquiring as the recordings have never sounded better and originally sounded far from clear, even if always thrilling. The original sound was too generous in its acoustics and produced somewhat 'swimmy sounds' where detail got submerged in the venue. This has now been completely rectified and is no longer a problem.<br /><br />The performances themselves have a remarkable sweep and exhilaration apparent from first note to last. This may have something to do with the circumstances of their making. The orchestra and conductor were originally booked to record Wagner's Rienzi but at the last moment two singers pulled out and that recording had to be abandoned. It was decided to use the booked time slot to make a recording of this set of Schumann. The orchestra was already very familiar with Schumann's work with a history of that link going back to the time when Schumann lived in Dresden. The change of direction for the recording sessions must have introduced an element of freshness and spontaneity with little opportunity to over-rehearse. The result, as one American reviewer put it, was 'Sawallisch's white-hot direction nails you to the wall.'<br /><br />This is one of those sets where absolutely everything seems to be perfect. Schumann's symphonies have an inner glow and compulsion in these performances that leaves most of the competition far behind. others may, and certainly do, bring other values to these works but for sheer excitement, verve, spontaneity and incandescence, these discs are in a class of their own.<br /><br />I would suggest that, no matter now many other recordings collectors have of these works, this set appropriately listed as one of the Great Recordings of the Century, is a 'must have' set. For those who are yet to buy their first or only copy of these works, this set has to be considered as one of the very best to put on the short-list.to put on the short-list.
B009Y61ZMI|2.0|I LOVED the original movie.  Seems the other reviewers missed the original, this version is a CUT UP version with a dozen scenes missing.  Too bad Amazon thinks time is more valuable than content.  Look for the original.  Would rate this 4 or 5 star but for the loss.  There is much  emotional content with respect to the solder being dumped without care for the life we have given by the people we served.  This character speaks less than 50 words but speaks volumes and shows growth beyond any normal human being!

B000GPI3OO|5.0|\\"Living In The Material World\\" may well be the last truly classic \\"Beatles\\" release, solo or otherwise. While McCartney came on strong with \\"Maybe I'm Amazed\\" and \\"Every Night\\" from his 1st solo release, and Lennon created two masterworks with \\"Plastic Ono Band\\" and \\"Imagine\\" - It was Harrison's initial output that seemed to be the strongest... and LITMW was a powerful follow-up to his classic \\"All Things Must Pass\\".<br /><br />But after the first couple of releases from each, the musical climate began to change. McCartney certainly enjoyed immense commercial success with Wings (as did John with \\"Imagine\\") - But only George Harrison's work seemed to rise to the high level that the Beatles as a band had laid out.<br /><br />Virtually any song from Harrison's first 2 albums would have fit in nicely with the finest offerings the fab 4 had ever released. It's amazing to think of \\"All Things Must Pass\\" or \\"Isn't It A Pity\\" being rejected in favor of say \\"Maxwell's Silver Hammer\\", \\"Honey Pie\\" or even \\"Why Don't We Do It In The Road\\"!<br /><br />\\"Living In The Material World\\" is a true classic from a very special place and time in music 3~*

B006ZB3V2C|2.0|The app is wonderfully itself actually deserves 5 stars. It is wonderfully done and could easily become my favorite white noise app. But there is a huge white elephant in the room. The permissions.  I decided to read their privacy polic to see why they thought they needed access to all those phone functions and it is because they use Flurry Analytics.  They make a big deal out of saying that Lightningbug.me does not get any personal info for them but they don't tell you that Flurry Analytics gathers personal info for themselves.  There is also not an option to opt out of this info gathering.  They claim that it will be an option in version 3.x and that it should have been released in late 2012.  App itself deserves 5 stars but I am removing 3 because of  the shady practices

B008JFUPK8|5.0|First off, I have to say that this was an excellent film. The actors were phenomenal, the direction was on point and the action was intense. Being that many of my friends saw the movie before me and raved about how good it was, I walked into the theater expecting a great movie. Thankfully, Man Of Steel didn't disappoint.<br /><br />They changed quite a bit of Superman's backstory, but they didn't stray too far from the beaten path. They just enhanced it and added little twists here and there. I particularly liked the storyline's direction and the flashes of Clark Kent's childhood during the story. Most of us already know the tale of his childhood, from the past Superman movies and of course the old CW series Smallville. However, the way they laid it out in `Man of Steel' made me feel like I was introduced to Clark Kent/Superman for the first time.<br /><br />Oh, and I absolutely love the new suit!<br /><br />Now there were some parts of it that gave me a little deja vu. I noticed elements were taken from other movies for the development of the planet Krypton and the creatures that resided there. That fact didn't take away from the whole experience of the movie though.<br /><br />Henry Cavill as Superman/Clark Kent/Kal-El ~ Not only was Cavill stupid freaking hot in this movie, he embodied a more emotional Superman. He took this role and modernized it, made it fit the world we live in now. Even the way he spoke registered as a Superman of this day. When I first found out Cavill was going to be the new Superman, I was doused with excitement. I've followed his career ever since he was a young buck.<br /><br />I remember him as Albert Mondego in one of my favorite flicks, The Count of Monte Cristo, Charles Brandon in the series The Tudors and Theseus in the movie, Immortals. And now he's Superman! I'm almost sure he won't live this role down any time soon, because so far he is the best Superman.<br /><br />Yeah, that's right. I said it!<br /><br />Don't get me wrong. Reeves will always be Superman in our hearts, but in this new day and age, Cavill has owned this character and taken him to a-whole-nother level. I think he deserves the Superman cape.<br /><br />Amy Adams as Lois Lane ~ Finally! A Lois Lane that isn't annoying as hell. Thank you writers of Man of Steel! I've never been a Lois Lane fan, even though Superman loved her to death. In my opinion, every Lois Lane before this one expressed her annoying demeanor and personality, more so, the Lois Lane from Smallville. Ugh, I could not stand her. That aside, I loved the way Amy portrayed this character. Of course, she was nosey and curious like any reporter, but she was likeable, to me at least. She did some things in this movie that the old Lois Lane would've never done, like the right thing for the sake of mankind for instance. The old LL was selfish, all about getting her story out and didn't care who she had to exploit to do it, but this new LL had a fairly sizeable conscious and actually listened to reason. Yeah, I was shocked too.<br /><br />Russell Crow as Jor-El ~ OH MY GOD! Best Jor-El EVER! Russell Crow owned that role! We all know he's an exceptional actor. Well he reminded us of that fact in this movie. Jor-El was a badass. When General Zod accosted him like he was merely some defenseless scientist, he put Zod on his backside. *grin* Loved that scene! What I liked most about his character was that he was more dangerous in death than alive. Sure, he showed his physical strength when he went up against Zod and his army, but he displayed his brilliance and never-ending power in the afterlife when his son needed him. He was a soul that never died. I was awestruck while watching him.<br />Someone needs to give him an award for that role. Seriously.<br /><br />Michael Shannon as General Zod ~ Michael first caught my attention in the movie Jonah Hex, then again in the series Boardwalk Empire, and recently in the movie Premium Rush. I think he has a crazed disposition in real life and it shows in the characters he plays. Don't get mad at me for saying that. Just remember, it takes one to know one. ;)<br /><br />General Zod had a deep-seeded cause for his madness and his passion to see it through was relentless. I feel Michael expressed that passion beautifully. Yeah, he was the bad guy and pretty damn crazy, but his goal had merit. No, I don't agree with wiping out the human race to achieve this goal. Genocide is never the answer. *grin* But his will and determination to rebuild his world on earth could be felt through the screen. He would stop at nothing, not even Superman, to get it done.<br /><br />In my opinion, Michael delivered an applause-worthy performance.<br /><br />The fight scenes between General Zod and Superman had me about to jump out of my seat. They were epic, and probably the longest battle scenes I have ever seen. And the graphics... wow. Outstanding! The whole movie was awesome, but the Superman vs Zod scenes were memorable. It was so fast and intense, I was afraid to blink. I might've missed something.<br /><br />For the record, I will be going to see the Man of Steel a second time at the theater, just for the action scenes, and I will also be purchasing it for my Superman collection. :Deal life and it shows in the characters he plays.

B00A8ECU24|2.0|My kids are very into My Little Pony and I figured this would be a great thing to have on my Kindle for the times when they get to play games on it (like when I'm driving and would prefer to not have distractions).  Unfortunately this game is one of the many apps out there that exist to generate more money for the developer.<br /><br />I am not against making money on apps, heck I'd love to come up with one that would do just that, but when it is a game directed at kids but it really needs purchases with real world money in order to progress through the game at a pace that keeps the kids attention I find it annoying and don't want my kids to play it.  I got the app for them, I don't need regular requests for purchases of items within the game as well.<br /><br />It may be good for older kids, or those with the patience to play at lower levels but if you want to progress you'll need to be ready to lay out some more money.

B00A85EMVK|1.0|I own about 30 3D Blu-rays.  I have never seen a transfer done as poorly as this one for the 3D version of the movie.  The picture is full of snow in many scenes.  The darker the scene, the snowier it gets.  I contacted Paramount Home Entertainment to seek a resolution, and here's what they said...&#34;Unfortunately, that is the way the 3D version was pressed.  Nothing new is being reissued.  Have you tried getting a refund or exchange?  Sorry, we do not give refunds.&#34;  It sounds like they know they have an issue.<br /><br />This release is the same as the previously issued Special Collectors Edition with the 3D disk added in.  Both this set and the Special Edition have the exact same special features included on the regular Blu-ray disk.  The regular Blu-ray picture is far superior to the 3D version, and your 3D TV will probably do just as good a job (or better) at up-converting the superior 2D version to 3D for you.  So buy which ever one is priced lower.  Just don’t plan on being able to watch the 3D disk.  It makes you shake your head in disgust every few minutes.

B00BTHWFBK|5.0|Okay. The album itself is great, but sometimes the main riffs just kind of meld together and there isn't enough variation, but HOT DAMN! Those bonus tracks are fantastic! Don't get me wrong, over half of the tracks on the regular album are really really good, but you will be missing out on a lot if you don't get the bonus songs.<br /><br />Metal is back, baby!
0045300232|4.0|I ordered one of the used versions and I'm very satisfied with the condition of the book. The binding is strong, pages are clean. It arrived in a timely fashion. I'm giving it a 4 star because the cover has some minor wear on it.<br />The book itself is very interesting and the adventures of Dr.Feynman are very amusing.
193700788X|3.0|I felt this series jumped the shark several books ago, but it's light reading, not litt-tra-chure, so okay with me. I'm just glad it's over. It was obvious from the first book that Sookie and Sam were meant for each other, no surprise at the ending. Everything else was just Harris going through the motions. There are several book series (Outlander, Wheel of Time, Game of Thrones) where the fan base is hounding the author for more. They should stop. The author knows when the well has run dry, but those golden handcuffs of bestsellerdom don't give the writer the freedom to stop. The fan base demands a book, any book, and this is just what they get. She could have stopped four or five books ago, and I would have been happy with what was there. When we demand  more from a writer than the writer has to give, this is what we get. And we deserve it. I hope Harris will continue writing. There were some very interesting flashes of insight into the power politics of a royal court and a courtier's life that make me wonder if she might go down that road next. Not necessarily another bunch of Tudor stuff, that we don't need, but something about power politics and the people who are drawn to it and the price they pay. Mafia? Drug cartel? Washington? Something along those lines. I hope so. She's a talented writer when she isn't chained to the bench by her fan base and forced to churn out novels she obviously doesn't want to write.

B00BEPVAV8|3.0|For me, this was too difficult to control. I ended up off road or in the water usually. The scenery and graphics were great and it was fun trying, however, no matter how much I played I just could not control it. After a while it was frustrating so I gave up. May just be the operator. LOL Worth giving a try but be forewarned, hard to control and very sensitive.

B000002G8L|3.0|At the time of this recording, Eric had canned his Oklahoma posse consisting of the late great bassist Carl Radle, along with drummer Jamie Oldaker, keyboardist Dick Sims, vocalist Marcy Levy, and guitarist George Terry and replaced them with a band that had yet to find its footing - even with such seasoned vets as guitarist Albert Lee, and keyboardist Chris Stainton. The live renditions of Tusla Time, All Our Past Times, and Worried Life Blues are worth the price of admission, as are Clapton's solos. Kudos to the mixers / engineers as the album has a crisp sound, especially Clapton's guitar. If you are a fan of this period of Clapton's career, this is an essential collection.

B005V20JKI|1.0|I USED to love this game. It was a great way to kill some time between college classes and I've even recommended it to friends.<br /><br />Saw that there was an update and thought to myself \\"cool, new levels or maybe a new character!\\" I couldn't have been more wrong.<br /><br />Since the newest update, they've added a purchase system into the game. This system locks a majority of ANY progress you've made. Also caps your level at 20, and re-locks characters. What kind of bull is this? It was bad enough to have to start over when I got my new phone. But now I'm locked at level 20 in a FREE game unless I pay money to unlock what I've already unlocked. What a dumb idea.<br /><br />Uninstalling. Congratulations, you guys ruined a perfectly good, free game

B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|There isn't much more to say beyond what has already been said. This is the kind of movie you'll either love or loathe -- depending on your overall attitude towards films. It's complex, contemplative and requires a high level of attention. It also helps to have at least some fundamental understanding of Buddhist principles if you're going to understand its deeper meaning.<br /><br />All that said -- I honestly think this is one of the greatest films I've ever seen. Acting, score, cinematography -- all first rate. I've watched it twice and at this point I would have to place this in my Top 10 films of all time.
B005IQZB14|5.0|This book really resonated with me. My mother died when I was the same age as the author when she lost her mother. I completely identified with her feelings of loss and anger.

0195145925|4.0|Is time a mere illusion? British theoretical physicist Julian Barbour argues that time itself does not exist in the universe. He claims that both time and motion is an illusion our brain creates for our human-centric perception of a physically static universe. Barbour's claim is certainly provocative. I do not wish to quarrel with him regarding his claim's technical soundness. Having read his book, The End of Time, I managed to remain respectful of his main proposition and ingenuity.<br /><br />Philosophers often point out to theoretical physicists who are marching into their traditional territory that they are in fact dealing with the traditional problems of philosophy that won't be solved using scientific methodology, which is basically hypothetical inductive reasoning. Stephen Hawking is one prominent theoretical physicist who rejects philosophers' such criticism - with no good either scientific or philosophical counter-argument - and even declared almost out of scientific fanaticism, \\"Philosophy is dead.\\" I personally wish that I could bet on Hawking's religious faith in what he loosely deems as \\"science.\\" But I have to agree with his critics that theoretical scientists like Hawking or Barbour for that matter are in fact no longer doing science since their claims are purely based on mathematical crunching and therefore not possible either to confirm or refute based on observation/experiments, a core scientific methodology.<br /><br />I also see Barbour running into the problem of paradox that Thomas Kuhn's critics raised for his The Structure of Scientific Revolutions. If Barbour is right (time is indeed an illusion), we would have very little reason to believe in his own claim since he would have ironically ended up destroying the very foundation of science - built on a priori existence of time and space - which many other established theories he borrowed were also built upon. If Barbour is indeed right, we no longer have any reason to believe in science's, and also Barbour's, presumption that the whole world we observe is physical, out there independently, and also governed by the law of causation which has nothing to do with our subjective consciousness. I am not sure if he can escape from this paradoxical self-contradiction which ultimately destroyed credibility of Kuhn's otherwise brilliant intellectual accomplishment. It is somewhat eerie to recall a Buddhist philosopher's argument that all (Western) scientific statements are bound to prove self-contradictory in the end (because of its \\"religious\\" metaphysical presumption that there is a physical world independently out there - e.g., traditional monotheism based on the presumption of existence of the creator God won't make much sense if there is no independent physical world \\"out there.\\"<br /><br />Barbour spent most of his book's pages to show - with some ingenuity - how the universe as a theoretical construct of the modern physics can be also re-interpreted to be completely static (in a sense, this type of argument is clever rearranging of the existing theories). He focuses on removing time from an equation of physics since time poses a deeply troubling problem for modern physics. He then simply and quite conveniently tosses over to neuroscientists the heavier task of explaining how the human brain (or consciousness) produces a consistent, extremely well-regulated and relentless movie out of a timeless and motionless universe. No offense intended, but I've found his shockingly naive understanding of neuroscience here almost unbelievable; isn't a human brain also simply part of a physical universe subject to constant changes he denies?<br /><br />I am not sure if Barbour fully realizes that the very foundation of modern physics will shatter and its devastating theoretical consequences - even for his type of theory itself - if time is indeed not real. One may also ask the single most persistent question of philosophy here: which comes first, mind or matter? If time is not `real' after all, we have little reason to believe that we are in fact real (not that I insist that we have to be real, whatever 'real' means). It only bolsters idealists' skepticism that we do not know that there is actually a `real' universe out there then (not that I reject their stance, but it only means modern science then proves to be nothing but a sophisticated but completely wrong human imagination.)<br /><br />Barbour is a rare independent academic doing serious research outside an ivory tower. The mainstream physics community seems to be rather ignoring or reluctant to embrace his clever theorizing out of established laws of physics and theories (no surprise here^^). Barbour's theory - like those of many contemporary theoretical physicists - cannot be either falsified or experimented for confirmation, which raises another question whether this type of speculation growing among contemporary theoretical physicists today is really science. Karl Popper, probably the most influential philosopher of science who's shaped a mainstream modern conception of science, would also deny since there is no way to falsify Barbour's kind of theories via either observation or experiment. Besides whether his idea is a falsifiable-therefore-scientific theory of physics or not, I nonetheless find his underlying idea - personally - alluring in that his conclusion is consistent with what many great philosophers and ancient Buddhists have envisioned of the universe.<br /><br />Time has been a consistently puzzling topic for many philosophers, both ancient and modern. No truly great philosopher ever missed the critical importance of time for our self-conscious existence. Even from a philosophical perspective, I believe that Barbour's hypothesis is worth considering since making time `an illusion' is one logical way to remove a persistent puzzle of time from modern physics, although that will put us right back into the original box of puzzle again (which in my opinion should be rather embraced for new thinking); Newton was well aware of this paradox when he simply decided to accept both time and space as \\"absolute\\" without offering any scientific rationale (and his secretly but deeply religious idea persists even today). The idea that time does not exist is nothing new in the history of philosophy. But the theoretical claim, whether philosophical, spiritual or scientific,  based on speculation alone does not make time go away. For me, many modern physicists' theory of time sounds increasingly boring since it is all purely speculative, whether peppered with mathematical equations or not. In the end, time persists for everyone of us as so real as before.<br /><br />Not only ancient Buddhists but gifted Western philosophers often arrived at the same conclusion that time might be mere illusion - that is, from a logical, analytically, spiritual or even meditative perspective. Why are those non-ordinary perspective telling us truth or more truthful than our everyday experience we all share though? Physicists, even one as gifted as Einstein or Newton, were always puzzled by the phenomena of time but had never seriously denied the very realness of time itself. Barbour as a theoretical physicist is perhaps to be noted in that regard alone.s not `real' after all, we have little reason to believe that we are in fact real (not that I insist that we have to be real, whatever 'real' means).

B00382S9TQ|3.0|Thought it would be as fun as the other seasons, but the plot is boring, kind of dramatic, instead of fun and fresh.
B00BC5I6Q2|5.0|I actually didn't think I'd like this series for some reason, but I was hooked from the beginning. It's incredibly well written and acted. It's like an easier to take West Wing (meaning, no stylistic dialog or endless walking around a set). Each character is unique and it's wild how they all come together. Spacey is particularly good.

You can really relate to everyone in the story, especially Charlie since he is the main character and the one telling he story. It is written in a diary-like format and it is one if the best books I have ever read!! I am 13 and I thought I wouldn't like this kind of book because I usually read like sci fi dystopian type books but I am glad a gave this book a try because I absolutely loved it. It is a little slow at first but trust me, stick with it and I know you wil love it just as much as I did. 😊

The Dark Crystal.<br /><br />Everville: The First Pillar is an epic fantasy and an Amazon Bestseller written for young adults. Everville is a debut novel by the energetic and ever eclectic Roy Huff. Roy is a one-man band of promotion who has blown past an impressive array of milestones in the several months since the publication of Everville.<br /><br />Roy makes his home in Hawaii. Like many successful authors, he has tried many occupations and no doubt can tell a tale or two. He holds five degrees in liberal arts, history, secondary science education, and geoscience. I reviewed the Kindle Edition of Everville. Roy and I also follow each other on social media.<br /><br />Buy 'Everville: The First Pillar' Now<br /><br />Everville was professionally formatted, printed, and edited by Telemachus Press. Indie Authors will recognize Telemachus as the Press made famous by John Locke, author of the Donovan Creed Series. Roy clearly picked a winner by choosing a high-end press and the quality shows on the cover and in the interior of the eBook.<br /><br />Roy wrote Everville in an easy-to-read first person style. The Gentle Reader should expect to read it in about an hour and a half.<br /><br />Owen Sage goes off to college and apparently discovers he is the one chosen to save the world of Everville somewhere between here and there. Pardon the quip, but the Gentle Reader may feel he has accidentally slipped into a forgotten episode of Zelda.<br /><br />Following Owen's adventure reminded me of watching a young Kurt Russell, circa `The Computer Wore Tennis Shoes,' on a quest through a world that felt it was designed by Jim Henson.<br /><br />The book is clean, decent, and appropriate for all audiences. I would recommend it for older tweens, ages 10-12, not for restricted content, but for the conceptual complexity.<br /><br />Reviewed by:<br /><br />D A Knight<br /><br />Author of<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CMXCKTC Cretaceous Clay & the Black Dwarf (The Chronicles of Cretaceous Clay)]] and<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CMU103C Cretaceous Clay & The Ninth Ring (The Chronicles of Cretaceous Clay)]]><br />Author of<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CMXCKTC Cretaceous Clay & the Black Dwarf (The Chronicles of Cretaceous Clay)]] and<br /><br />[[ASIN:B00CMU103C Cretaceous Clay & The Ninth Ring (The Chronicles of Cretaceous Clay)]]

B00CRMWMZ0|4.0|Daft punk was once my most hated electronica act.  Why?  The music was repetitive, memorable, and would stay stuck in my head.  I think doing soundtracks has done them a world of good.  This tribute to the 70s has more feeling and musicality than any previous album.  It is repetitive, memorable, and stays stuck in my head - in a good way.  Their collaborations also strengthen the album - love the track with Panda Bear.  I have been listening every day for a couple weeks now (very unusual), and loving it.  Thanks!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I really enjoyed this game but it needs to have more levels. I am disappointed that I've completed it already.

You are an inspiration.
B009R659L8|5.0|It has been ages since I've read one of MHC's fabulous books, but after Daddy's Gone a Hunting I'm a fan reborn. She masterfully weaves a tale that keeps you guessing until nearly the end as to whose behind the crimes from both present day and decades past. It's a page turner replete with characters you grow to love and care about, and others that have seemingly lost their souls. Intelligent, thoughtful, intriguing and thrilling, this is one of those literary works that satisfies the mind  in every way and makes you appreciate gifted writing all the more. This was chosen as a Book Club read and I am so looking forward to our lively discussion about it next week. Bravo Ms. CLARK. You rock.
B003ELKNH2|4.0|Apocalypse Now is a very interesting ride.  I would say this movie should be seen at least once in your lifetime.  However, while it is a very good movie, it is not a movie that can be viewed many times.  It is very long, it is a bit depressing, and at times it is quite boring.  Many people may not like the film because while it is a war movie it is not like any regular war or action movie.  There is not that much action in the film, even during the last act.  The film is not structured like your normal film either.  The pacing seems very off in places.  I will be reviewing the redux version of the film from 2001.  I have not seen the original film from 1979.  I will not be comparing this version from the original, but as a film on its own.<br /><br />The movie stars Marin Sheen as Captain Willard.  He is being sent on a classified mission to Cambodia to kill a renegade soldier named Col. Kurtz (Marlon Brando) that is now deemed insane.  I think this is Martin Sheen's best role and performance that I have of him.  The crewmates that he is with for most of the movie are all fun characters for the most part.  I was not overly annoyed with any of them.<br /><br />Marlon Brando is great is always but he has barely any screen time.  Brando has second billing to Martin Sheen but he does not appear until the last act of the film.  Keep in mind that this movie is over three hours.  I know that they were trying to build up your expectations and keep you in suspense.  I like how they built Kurtz up throughout the movie and I like story behind him, but I still wish he was in the film more.<br /><br />This movie has weird passing issues as well.  The majority of this movie feels like padding.  The overall plot revolves around Willard going kill Kurtz, but ninety percent of this movie is him getting to his destination.  I know it was like this in order to showcase some of the Vietnam War.  Some of it works and some of it does not.  I like the scenes showcasing the war.  There isnot that much action though.  The biggest action scene of the whole movie was near the beginning.  This might turn some people off who are expecting big action scenes like in Saving Private Ryan.  However this film does a great job at depicting how the Vietnam War was.  The film also has a bleak atmosphere throughout most of which definitely fit the setting.<br /><br />However, there are some scenes in the film that I have no clue why they are even in the movie.  There is this one long scene near the beginning that focused on this weird General that likes to surf, which is weird especially since we see him ever again.  There is this very drawn out scene in which Willard and his crew stop at this run down barracks and proceed to flirt with all the women there.  The weirdest scene is when the crew meets these French people and have dinner with them.  There is also this mini romance between Willard and this French woman, which felt extremely out of place.  It really felt like I was watching a different film when I saw that.  I do not know if these scenes were in the original or if they were added back in for this version, but I am going with ladder.  All of those scenes felt extremely pointless, and I do not know what they were for.<br /><br />I love the look of the film.  The setting looks very much like Vietnam.  The few action scenes there were I enjoyed.  The score was amazing.  I also like the atmosphere throughout most the film.<br /><br />Overall Apocalypse Now Redux is a good movie and, to be honest, one of my favorite war movies.  However there was not that much action, which might turn some off.  Plus there are many pointless and drawn out scenes which can get very boring.  It is not really a film that can be watched again and again.  However, I highly recommend that you see this film at least once.
B004BJMEO6|5.0|Loved this film! Indie films are getting SO much better, both in the writing AND the production!!! This film is very well acted, beautiful actors and a storyline that's NOT what you think...it's better!!! Nicole Conn is wonderful at what she does!  And when you're done with this one, you'll want to see \\"A Perfect Ending\\" as well.  And stay tuned, I hear there's another on the way!  Keep 'em coming Ms. Conn - we LOVE your work!!!!!

B00AZMFO6I|4.0|Ronald Harwood wrote both the original play and the screenplay for this diversion and somehow managed to get Dustin Hoffman to direct. The concept of a sound one - what happens to retired musicians who can no longer care for themselves after years of glory before the public has accompanied them to the station of being elderly and in need of assistance? Turning this situation into a comedy takes taste and restraint and Harwood delivers both - as does Hoffman.<br /><br />In Beecham House, a home for retired musicians Cecily (Pauline Collins), Reggie (Tom Courtenay), Wilfred (Billy Connolly) and Cedric (Michael Gambon) are preparing plans for the annual October 10 concert to celebrate Verdi's birthday - and to raise funds so that Beecham House can survive. They are tended by Dr. Lucy Cogan (Sheridan Smith) who manages to fend off sexual advances from Wilfred while assisting the entire ensemble in their participation. All goes relatively smoothly until the arrival of the newest tenant, MegaDiva Jean Horton (Maggie Smith) arrives on the scene (Jean is Reggie's ex-wife, a divorce that didn't end amicably). When informed that she must participate in the Verdi gala, Jean refuses and the rest of the film is the interaction of the other residents with Jean and how Jean manages to change her attitude - and heart.<br /><br />The film gently shows the comical aspects of approaching senility in some and the personality quirks in others. The story is slight but does carry a warm message. It is not until the end of the film that we discover that the majority of `actors' who appear as residents in Beecham House are in truth retire and aging stars of yesteryear. They deserve mention here: Andrew Sachs, Dame Gwyneth Jones, Trevor Peacock, David Ryall, Michael Byrne, Ronnie Fox, Aleksandra Duczmal, Denis Khoroshko, Sarah Crowden, Colin Bradbury, Patricia Varley, Ronnie Hughes, Jack Honeyborne, John Rawnsley, Nuala Willis, Melodie Waddingham, Cynthia Morey, John Heley, Graeme Scott, John Georgiadis, Ita Herbert and Ania Duczmal.<br /><br />The quartet members and Gambon do a fine job and the audience is left with an appreciation for the path down which we all are eventually headed.

B009AMAGQM|3.0|I watched the movie first and it was OK--a bit hokey at the end but what the heck it was put out in Hollywood. Then I read the book. After reading the book I don't care for the movie at all and will be giving away my DVD. The movie skipped Ethan's mom's intervention and Aunt Miriam entirely. And the sentimental Hollywood sacrifice ending wasn't there as it the movie portrayed it.
B00CO8D3G4|4.0|I read James Altucher's blog posts because I like his attitude and some of his practical advice. This book contains a lot of material he's published before, and it's good to have it in one place. He has some good advice on what it takes to become an entrepreneur, and it helped me realize I don't want to be one! Now I just have to determine what I do want to be, and since I'm 74 years old, I probably should decide pretty soon.
0765350386|3.0|I found this book to be moderately enjoyable. The fact that the book dealt with inciting a rebellion amongst the lower classes was a novel change from the typical adventure/quest storyline I'm used to. I expected the book to be filled with complex characters who would introduce me to their intricate political and military manoeuvrings. Instead I got flat characters and a rebellion that should have been quashed the instant it was conceived of due to the astounding incompetence of those organising it. The main characters repeatedly imply that all it would take for them to get found out would be for one man to go to an authority yet they seem to let those \\"in the know\\" wander about unimpeded and take very few precautions when protecting their safe houses or \\"top secret\\" plans.<br /><br />Vin alternates between being a former street kid with PTSD and a silly girl sighing over pretty dresses who longs to attend more balls. Her character development is seriously all over the place and I thought one of the most implausible things about her was the way she \\"fell in love\\" with Elend. Seriously, she met a nobleman at a ball where she was sent as an undercover spy and after meeting him on a balcony where she reprimands him for reading she is left feeling like she had a deep connection with him. There is no explanation as to why she felt this deep connection other than a vague idea that she felt she \\"could be herself\\" around him which is not only inexplicable (her being an undercover spy and all) but goes no further toward explaining the problem. Vin is also injured in a fight with some of the authorities and then retires for weeks to recover from her injuries. The cover story? She's sick. The fact that the authorities couldn't put two and two together is ridiculously unbelievable. The characters overall were not well rounded, sure we learned their back stories but any of their more complex emotions or personality traits are left undiscovered.<br /><br />I did like the interesting creatures and magic system. The mistwraiths and inquisitors were a highlight for sure. I only wish more time had been devoted to finding out more about them. Overall I'd recommend the book. It's interesting enough but requires a strong ability to suspend your disbelief and don't expect the characters to ring true.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Yup, the even numbered ones are (generally) pretty entertaining, and the odd numbered ones are definitely a step down.  Nice extras, too.
0989254607|4.0|I liked this novel very much for it's imagination, it's division into two parts as the hero deals with some Very Unexpected Problems.  But I liked this most because this young less than 25 year old woman cares about justice and about taking action on her own behalf and on behalf of her beliefs. She is a hero as an ordinary person. Can't say more than that without being a spoiler.  But she is also plucky, passionate and confused. Add this to spiders and the author's imagination and you have a good book.  The titles of the chapters are playful and on track.<br />My one complaint.  the book loses some of its humor when the heroine is at her very super best.  I would have liked some of the other women characters to come out in more ways than as victims.<br />Bottom line a good read, with plot twists and turns, great and original ideas by the author,  and best, a really good, if naive, woman hero.
B000IOM0WY|1.0|I bought the dvd back in 2003 and a buddy of mine just picked up the blu-ray from Amazon.  I've recently been upgrading movies in my collection from dvd to blu-ray and try to use bluray.highdefdigest.com to get a feel for the quality of the transfers before doing an upgrade.  It seems that in many cases the transfers are upgrades even if only modestly.  This movie is the exception.  The quality of the transfer to blu-ray is really like watching the dvd of the movie.  As a dvd it was only an OK transfer at best aka dirt and specs in the transfer and it appears all that was transferred to the blu-ray.  I like this movie but if you are looking to upgrade your copy for a better quality picture don't bother this blu-ray is not the answer.  There were rumors of a remaster copy being done in 2010 but I never could find any evidence that it was ever released or if it was it was so poorly advertised/documented that you would never know.  Hope this helps any fans of this movie hold out until/if a real remastered better quality transfer arrives.

B004FGMDOQ|5.0|Spooky kids are one thing. These kids truly are peculiar. The book is recommended for \\"young adults\\" , or older kids, but I'm 62 and was fascinated with it. The pictures are wonderful . What a unique idea for a story. It didn't let me down at the end and I can't wait for the next book.
B00DGMVJAO|5.0|I really enjoyed this movie. In fact I will probably end up purchasing it. I love fantasy and adventure which this movie has plenty of. The acting is excellent with some big name actors such as Ewan McGregor. I really like him. This film was made in the UK and I can't recall ever seeing a movie from Britain that I haven't liked. Awesome film.<br /><br />It does have violence, and frightening images in it that would probably frighten younger children so I would stick to the PG-13 rating.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|If this game had been a paid app, I would have given it 4 stars for length of game (which is fairly short-9 levels) but since it was free it definitely earned its five stars. Great puzzles make for a fun escape game.
B00A8MGLAI|5.0|This movie is about the reverberations of human actions and consequences spreading out through time, and at a very deep level of abstraction, as revealed through a collection of vivid concrete stories. But don't believe any interpretation/explanations you read--even this, believe only what the movie reveals to you.  Still, from my own experience I have to believe many people will find this move deeply rewarding for diverse reasons.

030758836X|4.0|For prospective readers:<br />Two people enter a marriage with enough mismatched baggage to sink a ship. The result is an extreme - and extremely interesting - story of marriage as an evolving compromise between two people who need each other to counter their weaknesses but resent each other for exploiting those weaknesses. Passive-aggressive manipulation doesn't begin to describe how these two mess with each other. If you liked \\"Presumed Innocent,\\" this is an updated, more sinister version. As a piece of writing, it's clever, modern and well-crafted. A first-person-dual-narrator device and chronological tilt-a-whirl keep it suspenseful.<br /><br />For those who've read it (spoiler alert)<br />I was completely taken-in and feeling the full weight of husband-guilt until the abduction twist, which felt like an implausible, last-chapter plot-fixer. It required suspension of disbelief, which is fine, but that also means suspension of empathy, so from that point on the characters were less relate-able and I was more an observer than participant. This, and a couple of minor plausibility quibbles, kept me from giving it five stars.
B000FCKGPC|3.0|This book was entertaining but not up to the level of the first three.  I am not sure I will buy the 5th edition, for sure I am not paying 15.99 for a kindle copy.  Really !!!  As much as I love the Kindle for reading, it just burns me to pay the same price for an electronic copy as you do for a paper copy.
B006Y9BULE|5.0|Good watch for the money, and the watch looks good.  I highly recommend this watch.  Its a 5 star product.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I insanely enjoyed this book, I would honestly recommend this book to anyone, I think that everyone just needs to feel infinite. I really wish there was a sequel.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|Totally enjoyed the book and lessons of our past history.<br /><br />Should be required reading for everyone so we never go to war again.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Not much to say except it is a great game.  Runs smoothly on my cell phone and I enjoy it when setting in waiting rooms or on the road.  Great game if you haven't played it, extreme match game and good memory exercise.  Recommended for anyone looking for an entertaining game with no violence, blood or guts, and it can be played in the silent mode also.
0062255657|5.0|Haunting.<br /><br />If I had only one word to describe this book, it would be 'haunting.'<br /><br />In all, it is a hard book to describe, just as experiences and memories are hard to describe even to a person who shared the event that gave rise to the experience and memory.  And this is what the book is about, the personal, idiosyncratic nature of memory and experience.  Or at least this is one of the things the book is about.<br /><br />The tale definitely has the feel of a short story, but a short story that could not accept its boundaries. It is a simple story told simply, revealing a complexity hidden beneath the surface simplicity that enchants and lulls you into its depths.  It is a pond that hides an Ocean.<br /><br />Adults are sure that their lives are more complex than children's.  But is that a surface complexity that belies an underlying narrowing down of possibilities from a child's borderless world?  As Gaiman says, \\"Adults follow paths. Children explore.\\"<br /><br />As adults, is it because our minds have gotten narrower, smaller, less complex that we can't remember so much from our childhood?  Do our mental constrictions that allow us to focus on the pragmatics of our daily life preclude the depth of experience open to any 7-year old?<br /><br />This story drew out of the Ocean depths of my memory experiences from my own childhood that I hadn't thought about in ages.  Part of the haunting character of the tale is this nostalgic provocation. This heartsickness to capture the feel of home and childhood again.  The time when adults were both a source of comfort and a source of terror.  As the boy in the story says, children experience and deal with terrors that an adult would not be able to bear.<br /><br />This book will speak to those who grew up buried in books and in their imaginations.  People who, as children, saw other humans as dangerous and sought sanctuary in books.  Seeking companionship lays you open to harm and the boy in the story discovers this to be true, not just theoretically but factually.  However, he finds that seeking companionship can sometimes also lead to finding a partner willing to share your risks and to combine efforts with you in fighting off the dangers of the world.<br /><br />To the reviewers hesitant to buy because of the brevity of the work: a true reader values a work by the experience given, not by the page count.  In this novel/novella, the brevity is perfect; it allows you to explore the Ocean beneath this seeming pond by diving down into your own experiences and memories.
B004J4WKTW|4.0|This book was a wonderfully inventive story. At times, I felt that it stalled a bit because of the way the story was told, but overall it was a very enjoyable read.
B008YZXYY2|4.0|This is a good album, with a nice mix of styles etc. The song Taciturn is absolutely beautiful. But has anyone noticed that, for the most part the song titles have NOTHING to do with the words & story of the songs !!!! I'm not sure what their thinking was, but it does make it more difficult to recall the song titles, when you are trying to tell someone about a particular song, or recall it yourself. Maybe it was a \\"spoof\\" on their part, to see if anyone noticed or cared, which most probably don't. But it is curious. Other than that small oddity, it is a good album.  Now lets check out part 2....

B00006F7IM|4.0|This is a movie with a lot of stars about a team of noname baseball players trying to become famous with a team owner trying to keep them unknown.  There are a lot of funny adventures and life lessons along the way.  Even if you're not into baseball or sports you'll like this comedy.  Especially if you root for the underdog.
B0014Z4ON4|3.0|A divisive chapter among fans of the series, Temple of Doom is easily the silliest of the initial Indiana Jones trilogy. While I've heard the argument that this character thrives on fantastical situations and traces of lore, for my money the envelope is pressed just a bit too far in this instance. Sure, Raiders used the power of the ark to melt the Nazis' skin and Crusade showcased an immortal knight with a collection of stand-in grails, but in each case those represented the climax of a long, grounded adventure - a mere taste of supernatural payoff. Temple shows no such restraint, diving straight in with voodoo dolls, mysterious brainwashing liquids and, memorably, bare-handed heart removals. It also tinkers with the formula of Jones as a loner, with mixed success. Indy's de-facto sidekick, Short Round, plays up every stereotype of a kid tagalong. He's shoehorned in, no doubt about it, but also adds a new dimension to the larger-than-life lead character via their rapid-fire rapport. The additional presence of a blonde love interest, Willie, seems redundant and unnecessary - her constant shrieks and clueless nature gives the impression Indy's babysitting two kids. Of course, it's not all bad news: Harrison Ford works wonders with his shadier lines and knocks the good ones right out of the park, the comic relief scenes (though over-applied) work surprisingly well, and the action / adventure elements the series is best known for hit all the right buttons. There's no shortage of that old, familiar formula here, but I wonder if Spielberg and Lucas may have overreached in an effort to make the film more palatable to the Saturday morning cartoon crowd.

Using common sense is encouraged, and will help you to &quot;win&quot; even if you feel guilty about it.

I've been regularly making the chocolate chip mint and mocha heath bar crunch for years - occasionally making Ben's chocolate. Most of the recipes are very easy - beat eggs and sugar, add cream and milk. I use egg beaters because they are pasteurized. The chocolate is more involved because you need to melt chocolate over a double boiler - but it's so good. Exactly like Ben and Jerry's Chocolate Fudge Brownie.

B00B2YH7D6|5.0|If your a music fan to any degree, get this doc. It is a loving tribute to a place that seemed to really want to nurture artists, not just chew them up and spit them out after they'd robbed them. It also offers an insight to the way records (!) were made when I was a kid- when you had to do it until you got a good take, not just make several half assed passes and then let some computo-whiz chop up the best parts, pitch correct them, and then assemble them into a finished product. You'll also be amazed at how many people who worked there went on to become major forces in today's industry.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Yes, I've been a fan since 1997, BUT this cd is the one I'd recommend to people who are still under the impression that Hanson is a boy band or one hit wonder. Hanson is neither of those.<br /><br />This CD has beats, groove, sounds that throw back to 60s/70s rock and roll. The lyrics are also meaningful. If you stop and take them in they will find a way into your heart and inspire.

B00701897I|5.0|I remember wanting to see this when it was in the theater, but I never got around to it.  A friend has a new 3D Tv and 3D Blueray, so I thought I'd buy this for a Tv-warming present.  I had no idea how well-made this movie was -- the characterizations were phenomenal from Andy Sirkis as Capt. Haddock, Daniel Craig as the villain and Jamie Bell as Tin Tin.  My Gawd!  The animation was so superb and intricate--you could see droplets of water blowing away on the portholes, each hair moving in the wind, the haircut lines, the ocean waves, all of it no detail unturned.  Then there's the storyline, which was complicated and adult for a \\"children's\\" movie.  My friend, who grew up in the movie business (his father, aunts and uncles were film cutters in the 30's through the 60's), generally has very little truck with bad movies (he generally falls asleep through them or he's always pointing a boom shadow or a bad film match -- always ANNOYING!).  He actually stayed awake and exclaimed that the animation had to be incorporated into real-life backdrops (something akin Dick Van Dyke dancing with penguins)...but it's not-- it's all computer animation and fantastic!  The atmosphere of the movie and the adventures may make you think of Indiana Jones--but, frankly, it's so much better!  The last scene indicates a new adventure...and I sure hope Stephen Spielberg and Peter Jackson make good on that.  I. Would. So. Like. To. See. It!  If you have 3D capability-do buy this.

B00AEFY66U|5.0|We had a copy and loaned it out.  Don't know where it went, so we bought this one.  We loved this movie so much more than the new one that we had to see it again.  There's no comparison.
B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|Ponyo is a goldfish who wants to become a human because she has fallen in love with a little boy. Beautiful film with extraordinarily detailed drawing and animation.
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|this is one of the best books i have ever read! i am giving it 5 stars because there was great detail and it was just a great story!  i would recommend this book to anyone!!
B003VSVWA0|5.0|While in Firezole in Italy we ate a a small restaurant overlooking Florence and they played this CD.  It fit the situation so well and I had to buy it.
B00170MYIS|5.0|It's a book, made of paper and nicely printed, the graphics are nice too. The pages are numbered nicely too....
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|The series went from a trilogy to 5 books, so it's not a 3 party story like 50 shades of grey. The first two books are amazing, but the third lacks substance and is more a filler to keep the $$ coming. It also has an abrupt end... I kept looking at my kindle thining I missed something during the download. I figured it out the story just ends like the fiste Lord of the Rings. I was sitting at my desk at work wishing for more. Lets just say It's was quite annoying. However I want to know what happends.... I just foundout though the authors website she is planning 2 more books as she needsmore time to close of the charaters so we as readers and not left with open-end questions. Just be aware that there are 2 more books and the story ends just as its getting good. Its a great story however the ending of the 3rd book makes me want to scream OMG! ARE YOU KIDDING ME!!!!
B005GFPZYK|5.0|more tree hugger need to read this, been to vietnam no picnicwhis more people would appreciate young men and woman who serve our country,
B0006J28BO|5.0|The &#34;Cat&#34; in question is a dapper statue of a cat in a tuxedo, which was pivotal in &#34;Whisper of the Heart&#34; and again in this film. Very well done animation and imaginative story.
0062255657|5.0|I couldn't put this down - it's scary in the way only Gaiman manages, where you feel brave just reading it, even as you're entirely creeped out.
B008M721MS|1.0|This app is only compatible with Kindle Fire HD, so it's of no use to me at all. Very disappointing.
0761169431|1.0|For the past 4 hours I've sat here and tried to make one photo worthy figure to advertise this book in an online catalogue... And for all it's failings I would recommend this infuriating volume as an indicator of homicidal tenancies in a person. For the same catalogue I've assembled more classic origami from 2 other books and been able to make an assortment of fun things. But this book... This book transcends confusion and adds insult when it has very little instruction to where your pattern should be and which way up you need to fold. I would not wish an hour of this book on my greatest enemy. And I hope the creator can sleep at night. May god have mercy on his soul.

B008UCJ7KO|4.0|I have to say I was nervous to buy this because of all the negative reviews after it came out. I've read the first two and loved them and I was a bit heart broken to read those reviews. But now that I have gotten the courage to read it I must say I am so confused with those reviews. Eva and Gideon's story continues and it's wonderful. You get to see much more of Gideon's side of things in this book and eva really develops into the strong woman in love with a strong man that I was hoping we'd see. I was upset that the series wasn't going to end when we'd been promise a conclusion but the more I think of it, there was just too many emotions and stories that need more time and energy put into them to fit into one final book. Gideon and Eva both have to deal with their emotions over killing Nathan and her parents issues could take a whole entire book all on their own! Gideon is healing from his childhood pain but he needs more story time to heal healthy and with eva. I disagree that the sex scenes were too many and too much. I think mrs.day is amazing with love scenes and she should write a book with just various love scenes. She's a master at them and she filled her book with what she does best ;)...I think there needed to be more books for Cary to heal also and at some point he and Eva have to become less dependent on one another and that will take time to do it properly and not to make the readers feel rushed. I didn't see this book as a filler. I saw it as a stepping stone of necessary information that's going to help the main characters eventually end up with a happy ever after. It does drive me insane that Eva doesn't press Gideon for answers on things, like him disappearing for 2 days without contacting her. I mean a text doesn't take long even if u r busy. I wish the future Eva to come would stop letting him sway her with his body and start making him get a clue!! The whole Corinne situation was a bit predictable but that needs a conclusion and fast. I hope the last two books aren't full of her drama bc seriously, how much can Eva be expected to put up with before she just knocks that girl flat on her butt!? Hopefully Corrine's husband will take her back wherever she came from and get her help and she will leave the Newlyweds alone. I also think there needed to be more books because Gideon's mom is disgusting and that needs time to develop a resolution too in a way that doesn't feel rushed. I didn't give this book 5 starts because I was not happy at all with the cliff hanger ending. It could have been done in a way that didn't make you think that Day ended it in the middle of a conversation. We deserved a little bit of a better ending considering we waited so long for this book and it wasn't the conclusion we were promised. However- I truly enjoy all of Sylvia days books and I was not at all disappointed in this one. I think it got a lot of bad reviews because so many people are mad about it not being the end of the series. But if you Put that aside, the story is still there and it's still growing and it's worth reading. And I can't wait for the 'last' two books. Hopefully we don't have to wait long.last two books aren't full of her drama bc seriously, how much can Eva be expected to put up with before she just knocks that girl flat on her butt!?

B006VFLIYK|4.0|I loved this book and the main character, Will Robie.  I normally read my books during my commute time but this book and the one following it, had me riveted to my kindle and I resented having to go to work or bed because I really wanted to just keep reading!
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Easy to play and fun to master,  this super addictive game is sure to make you smile! Once you start playing you will realize that an hour has gone by then two! I 'm going to be late for dinner honey!
B0050DIWFC|4.0|It's a suspense plot which brings a lawyer's work to its' most important level: the defense of his son for murder. Of course the lawyer is wise enough to hire a defense lawyer, but he cannot help getting involved. It's good intelligent entertainment, a fast beach read for those who like this genre and like surprises.  As a wife, I thought this wife should have tried to be more understanding and supportive to her husband, but other readers might disagree. It has additional interest to those who know Boston's suburbs.
B0000634EV|5.0|This album is just perfect, what can I really say? I mean it may not be near as heavy as the classic 1995 debut masterpiece &#34;NOLA&#34; was, but there's no question that &#34;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&#34; is an awesome masterpiece in it's own right, and an awesome follow up release to &#34;NOLA&#34; as well. While &#34;NOLA&#34; was more straight up heavy and in your face, this album has a much more 70's heavy metal, hard rock, southern blues vibe to it with a mix of Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Lynyrd Skynyrd, and Led Zeppelin, and yes even the album's subtitle is a reference borrowed from the lyrics of Zeppelin's epic masterpiece &#34;Stairway to Heaven&#34;. With Pantera bassist Rex Brown (who replaces Todd Strange), and producer Warren Riker, Down moved into singer Philip Anselmo's barn, dubbed &#34;Nodferatu's Lair&#34; located in Southern Louisiana where they lived and recorded the album in 28 days without anyone leaving the house. Philip Anselmo is in excellent form here captivating the listener throughout with his amazing singing abilities on here most of the time rather than his trademark screams and shouts that he was well known for back in his days in Pantera, meanwhile Kirk Windstein and Pepper Keenan both do an awesome job at pounding out riff after riff with pure perfection, and of course Rex Brown's bass really shines on here throughout as does Jimmy Bower's drumming providing a very thick and swampy rhythm section.<br /><br />Highlights on this awesome masterpiece of an album include the monstrous and heavy stomping opener &#34;Lysergik Funeral Procession&#34; (which includes a very memorable Sabbath-esque riff), &#34;There's Something on My Side&#34; (which features a catchy drum and bass intro plus more awesome brewing riffs as well as a cool melodic, swampy breakdown at 2:08 before the heaviness resumes around 3:11), &#34;The Man That Follows Hell&#34;, &#34;Stained Glass Cross&#34; (which has a very catchy southern blues rock vibe especially in the chorus), and there's also my favorite track &#34;Ghosts Along the Mississippi&#34; (which features an awesome opening riff plus excellent singing vocals from Phil and a great solo as well), and &#34;Learn From This Mistake&#34; (which is a nice slow and melodic number that includes some great bluesy melodic lead guitar work), and there's also &#34;Beautifully Depressed&#34;, &#34;Where I'm Going&#34;, &#34;New Orleans is a Dying Whore&#34;, &#34;The Seed&#34;, and the brilliant Zeppelin-esque acoustic closer &#34;Landing on the Mountains of Meggido&#34; which features guest vocals from Phil's ex-wife Stephanie Opal Weinstein. It's such a brilliant way to conclude the album, although it may not be as great as &#34;Bury Me in Smoke&#34; from &#34;NOLA&#34;, but it's still brilliant nonetheless.<br /><br />All in all, &#34;Down II: A Bustle in Your Hedgerow&#34; is an awesome sophomore album from start to finish, and if you enjoyed &#34;NOLA&#34;, then by all means you'll definitely enjoy this album for sure. True, it might not be as heavy as &#34;NOLA&#34;, but it is an awesome follow up nonetheless...Highly Recommended!!!n the chorus), and there's also my favorite track &#34;Ghosts Along the Mississippi&#34; (which features an awesome opening riff plus excellent singing vocals from Phil and a great solo as well), and &#34;Learn From This Mistake&#34; (which is a nice slow and melodic number that includes some great bluesy melodic lead guitar work), and there's also &#34;Beautifully Depressed&#34;, &#34;Where I'm Going&#34;, &#34;New Orleans is a Dying Whore&#34;, &#34;The Seed&#34;, and the brilliant Zeppelin-esque acoustic closer &#34;Landing on the Mountains of Meggido&#34; which features guest vocals from Phil's ex-wife Stephanie Opal Weinstein.

B00DGMVJAO|2.0|I've seen better graphics on the first Atari console.  The best part of this movie is its trailer. I want my money back.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Other games can be fun but this is like another review that I did. This game uses physics to teach you.
0525953728|4.0|I got this for my husband who is a SEaL nut.  HE knows a few seals personally. While it is very well written, he is disappointed because the names have been changed for security reasons.  While he understands the reasons, it is disappointing not to know if anyone he knows had participated in the raid.  Oh well, he seems happy with the book so far.
B00005JLR2|5.0|This is one of those movies that you never get tired of; it is just quality, a keeper, no matter what your age. The effects are great, story is great, characters are great, the moral is great. I like a movie that every time I see it I see something more; thats a timeless movie. Great for kids and adults
B005PWPUW6|5.0|I bought one of these on a whim for my little homebrew &#34;digital jukebox&#34; PC, which has an optical output. I liked it so well that I bought another for my TV when its analog audio output started to get dodgy. Very simple to install (only one switch which was already set in the correct position for me), easy to tuck away behind a TV or a stereo stand, but it is so nice looking you might want to keep it out front. The D3 will not help you if you plan to play 5.1 or other non-PCM multichannel formats, but I'm a 2-channel guy so it works fine for me. Apparently FiiO is experiencing problems with copycats, so they have started putting sealed serial numbers on their packaging, which you can enter at their website to see whether you have a genuine or a fake (both of mine were real, thank goodness).
074401493X|5.0|This is a beautifully detailed book with a hard cover, and raised lettering. It is perfectly organized with everything I needed to know about playing the game. The pictures are beautiful full color. The hints and instructions are exact and helpful.<br /><br />However, this will probably be my first and last time ever preordering ANYTHING from Amazon. I could have gotten it faster from the UK.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|The game Is ok.  It just needs to have different quests.  To many of the same ones consecutively.  Other than  it's good.
B009CF7GRY|3.0|I liked it with a modern twist but it was too similar to the original version.  Willard was adorable and the dance moves were great!!
1607053888|5.0|I wanted to learn how to make bags of good quality and also interesting. Bags that would not look home made.<br />This book it it. Easy to follow. Patterns for large bags as well as very small bags. If you are making multiple bags like I have, I would recommend making templates from the large pattern sheet. That way you will always have them. I will use this book for a long time.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Took some time to get into it, but once I did the story line became very interesting. Ending was truly unexpected and I was not even close to guessing outcome.
B005HEDI3K|5.0|I have watched episodes in both 480p and 1080p.<br />I actually prefer the 480p because it looks more like TOS.<br />The super high def version looks unnatural for some inexplicable reason.
B00CWY76CC|3.0|This is a good game, great to play. I only wish there were more floors to it, there aren't enough at the moment.
B007ZGO7EM|4.0|This calculator is great for quick work. If you are at the market you can total your purchases in no time.
B008B68IUY|5.0|Thanks so much it was everything she expected, was so very happy to receive this. some of these we just cant get in the stores so nice that you had them..<br />thanks again
B00BUADSMQ|3.0|After all the hype, I was sure it would be a hit, well it was a hit in the head.  This movie had no plot or story, the acting was poor and the movie should have been on the cutting room floor. After the 1st Die Hard they should have quit instead they may a Rocky collection.  It's time for Bruce to call it quits.
1936891026|5.0|Breaks down the reason for procrastination and helps you with overcoming it. I highly recommend it for anyone having creative blocks.
B007VDN1PA|4.0|We're using it for slides only and not film. It's easy to use, fast enough to be actually usable and compact. Some of the slides are a little tight getting in and out but it's no big deal and the price was right.
B004QNN1UI|5.0|for me is one the best concert from  simply-red, a good sound and it has all the best songs .
B008NEMN0K|1.0|The reason I gave this one star was I did not see hardly any 3-D effects in the 3-D. I had the movie on blue-ray and loved it but did not see very much differents in the two.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this app is amazing and I know it's $6.99 but it's totally worth it and it's been UPDATED :D we now get cake , spawn eggs in creative and we get more so get this app it's amazing!!!!
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Very simple and gives a quick way to access all the battery statistics without having to jump through hoops in settings.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun game, typical idea for this type of game. Will be exciting to see the new levels. Hope they come out quick. 10 levels on 6/19/13
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Again, here is another app with far too many permissions. Several people are having problems with their devices after DLing. I would automatically relate this to malware. The one, and only, reason I would change to iPhone is this very reason. They don't allow for malicious apps. When you have a large company like scAmazon pushing apps, without screening for detrimental ones, you begin to see the problem. This is another app I will, definitely, not be installing on my phone. If you don't believe it is bad, go ahead and install it on your device(s). Also, keep watching how many of these faotd's have excessive permissions. If I say to much more Amazon will reject this review. They have before.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very easy to read and hard to put down. I cant wait to read the next two, I may never get my homework done!
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|A good story, entertaing, a lot of information... but too exaggerated at times.Not as good as The Da Vinci Code
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|This game is so scary that I almost wet myself. It started and Slender was scary as crap I had 7/8 pages then I was so scared so I hid in a abandon home with a open door but I didn't know that Slender could find me so I hid in a room then went to do something than next thing<br />you know , Slender teleported in the room I was in and killed me instantly. I panted really hard that I almost died<br /><br />But anyway this game is great so buy it now and don't die on here though.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I love this game. I can't wait till more levels are added. I will recommend this game to my friends.
B00AO7HQ06|5.0|This compilation has been a long time coming but it is a fantasitc and forensically ordered sequence of tracks from wo to go....
B0002TJGQS|5.0|Instead of going to Radioshack and spending about twice as much, I prefer using this suplier. Good value for the money.
B0050R0YB8|5.0|Used this as incentive for a 9 year old. We took turns putting things together and it lasted two weeks. Now it sits in his room the prize of a lot of work.
B004N6369Y|4.0|Once again Danielle proves to be a connoisseur of human nature and writes in a way you can't put the book down!A very touching story with lots of different situations!
0688156819|5.0|I love everything Tim burton. This book was read within one day. Loved the stories and poems. This fits perfectly in my collection.
B00AKL1XPU|5.0|This has been one of the best games i have ever played and i recommend it for all children so please download this game.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I feel the romance of the downton abbeyl the series makes me feel as if I would have liked to live in that time. It wouldn't have mattered if I were one of the rich or the or one of the help.
B0076DCT2G|5.0|I am a big fan of the Coreys and De Mille writes excellent books. Hope he continues this serie and also the Paul Brenner series..
B008YWY0HK|5.0|I LOVED this movie! Finally a Disney princess who isn't all about love and finding Mister right, but instead learning right from wrong and finding herself as well. I thought all the accents were very well done, and the detailing of the movie was amazing. The scenes were breathtaking. Well done disney!
B00499NHLC|5.0|I really enjoyed noticing the similarities with the original stories.  Very clever and entertaining.  Good acting and good character development.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Being a prime member definitely has its benefits! I get to view certain movies and tv shows like Downtown Abbey for free, plus I get free two day shipping on almost everything I order! Highly suggested!
B001DHXT6G|5.0|It is like the series never aged a day. Chrystal clear pic with a lot of enhancements to make it look great. I waited for the price to go down from 300 to 60 for the full set but wish I didn't wait. This is AWESOME!
B00992CF6W|5.0|Minecraft is the best game ever and it is way better than survival craft cause the rust way to lazy to create there own game. I will always download this game in a heartbeat
B004DLPXAO|3.0|Well, now I can access books on my phone from my Kindle account. Formatting kinda sucks and is hard on the eyes, though. I will have to see how I feel after I use it more.
B004LWZWGA|2.0|I have tried to watch this movie three times, and each time I have fallen asleep. This movie just does not have the action or story line to hold my interest. I think much better villians could have been picked and a better story line would have helped too.
B0081336FO|5.0|Don't know how they could top this season.  We are anxiously waiting for the continuation to see how Sherlock works out of what seems to be an inescapable situation.  Love the characters and actors!
0375758992|5.0|The writing drew me into the story. I felt I was beside Bobo in her adventure of growing up in a world that is completely foreign to most people. It is well written. The words easily create a scene complete with smells, sounds and emotions. Well worth the read.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|An emotional roller coaster is the best way to describe this book!  It's filled  with even more surprises than the first Two books! Action packed, I could hardly put it down. She's done it again! Take a bow Suzanne Collins! An excellent write!
076535618X|4.0|Originally published at FanLit.<br /><br />The Last Colony, the third book in John Scalzi's OLD MAN'S WAR series, returns us to the perspective of John Perry, the \\"old man\\" hero of the first novel in the series, Old Man's War. John Perry is only mentioned in the second novel, The Ghost Brigades, which told the story of how the cyborg Special Forces soldiers found and defeated the scientist Charles Boutin, a traitor to the Colonial Union. On that mission they also found Zoe, Boutin's young daughter. Zoe has been adopted by Jane Sagan and John Perry and the little family has been farming on one of Earth's colonies where John and Jane are the leaders.<br /><br />Life is easy for them until the Colonial Union comes calling -- they need leaders for a new colonization effort and John and Jane have been selected. This new colony (named Roanoke.... hmmmm... I think I wouldn't have signed up for that) will be comprised of people from several different human worlds and John and Jane are responsible for its success. However, the Colonial Union hasn't been completely honest with them. It will be a lot more dangerous than the members of Roanoke have been led to believe. They are being played as political pawns and they don't realize it until it's too late. And it's not just Roanoke that's in danger, but the entire human race.<br /><br />The Last Colony (I keep wanting to write \\"The Lost Colony\\") has a different tone than Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades. It takes place mainly on a planet, rather than in space, and deals mostly with domestic and political matters rather than space battles and espionage. Some of the political dialogue between characters we don't know is dull, especially if you're hoping for lasers and explosions, but Scalzi continues to explore the interesting theme of access to information and the problems that occur when the government controls the press. When and how should governments control information? That's always a relevant topic, isn't it?<br /><br />Like its predecessors, The Last Colony features John Scalzi's engaging writing style and ultra-competent well-developed characters. Some of these are characters we already know and love (John and Jane) one is a character we are happy we're getting to know (Zoe) and some are new characters that Scalzi makes it easy for us to love (e.g., the Mennonite leader, Hickory and Dickory) or hate (e.g., the journalists). And some are there to show us that our first impressions aren't always correct.<br /><br />I mentioned in my review of The Ghost Brigades that the political situation was getting murky and it gets even murkier here. It is not clear to us (or to many of the characters) whose side we should be on. Readers may find it discomfiting to realize they are having trouble sympathizing with their home planet. It may be even more discomfiting to realize that Scalzi's story doesn't have to stretch the imagination too far. Sometimes \\"human nature\\" is not a pretty thing, but it's what we know. What if someday we find ourselves needing to interact with beings who have a non-human nature?<br /><br />You can probably read The Last Colony without having read the previous books, Old Man's War and The Ghost Brigades, but you'll have some catching up to do. It would be better to wait on this one until you've read its predecessors. They're both great books, anyway. The fourth book in the OLD MAN'S WAR series is Zoe's Tale which tells the story of Roanoke colony from Zoe's perspective. It's mostly the exact same plot as The Last Colony with a few side adventures for Zoe. If you're only interested in the plot progression, you can skip Zoe's Tale. If you're interested in getting to know Zoe, you should read it.<br /><br />I'm listening to William Dufris narrate OLD MAN'S WAR. I think he's amazing. Macmillan Audio produced this installment./>Like its predecessors, The Last Colony features John Scalzi's engaging writing style and ultra-competent well-developed characters.

B0034DGPEU|2.0|An interesting read. At times the story drags on tediously and at others the frantic screaming for mama gave me a headache. Heroine Lavinia's naïveté became ridiculous stupidity. With all the craziness, inbreeding and crossbreeding in their relationships whose to say Marshall was all white. That might explain his own crazy personality!  Disturbing. This is not a book I'd recommend if one is looking for a leisurely read.
B008220BLG|3.0|I read the book before watching this movie, perhaps that was a mistake as the book was a thousand times better. More details, more inner thoughts, more into why things were happening the way they were etc. Though the movie was good I felt so much more could have been added to it, more depth, more character development (I know that's hard for a zombie but still). I highly suggest the book over the movie.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|looooved this! would love to have more levels! so challenging and fun. would recommend for all. update soon please! Sarah
B0071XO8RA|4.0|Do a quick checklist: Do you like Sci-fi stories? Do you like post-apocaliptic stories? Do you like stories that deal on the psychology and mindset of people thrown into strange situations? Do you enjoy conspiracy theories?<br /><br />If your answer is a yes to most of these questions, then this might be a book for you. Not only it is all the things aforementioned, but is also packed in a nice narrative that makes this dark world a lot more...real I guess. While I read I found myself having rich mental images evocated by the good narrative, and making strong emotional connections with the characters. I couldn't wait to see what happened next, and that's always a good place to be with a book.
B0070Y46UY|4.0|Really good read, interesting, colorful and unpredictable.  I recommend it to anyone. Structure makes fir a quick read. Enjoy it!
B00BSBUZPK|5.0|We enjoyed the documentary and the concert.  We've watched it more than once. Friends want to borrow it, but I'm afraid I won't get it back!
B005LAII8A|1.0|When it takes a notebook, three friends, and a tub of popcorn to try and figure this movie out, and all of us are left still going HUH...it's just not worth it. Trying to keep notes, rewatching it make sure we got what we were supposed to get (which apparently we never did) and all of us having a chat about it to see if anyone had a solid agreement as to what really happened, means this movie wasn't worth it. The only plus side, it had Bruce Willis in it.

I have not used all the different positions yet but I am perfectly happy with just folding the flap over and reading like that. I love how it protects it a little bit better because my kids like to bring it to me if they want to read a book.

B00D6BN9NK|4.0|Love the Die Hard films.  Chase scene in the early part of film was great- had some new stunts that were incredible.  The dialogue was a bit forced with John McCain becoming a bit of a caricature of himself.  Shame, it's his dialogue and delivery that was always the best part of these films.  Hope they're not planning to pass the torch to the son who never existed before.  Still always a joy to watch Bruce.

B00C1GBOU6|5.0|I want to state first that I listen to all kinds of music. Rock, hip hop, metal, House, pop, indie, ambient, etc.  Sigur Ros has always had a special place in my heart with their music.  I can proudly say that they are my all time favorite band and I will listen to them for the rest of my life no matter what.  Sigur Ros has mostly been categorized as Post Rock, but they are their own genre in my opinion.  They have always made some of the most beautiful music I have ever heard.  To me, good music is good music regardless of whether it is mainstream popular or underground.  Sigur Ros make great and dreamy music that channels all kinds of emotions. My favorite albums of course were their untitled album \\"( )\\",\\"Takk\\" and of course \\"Agaetis Byrjun\\". I first discovered the band through their musical appearance in the movie \\"Vanilla Sky\\" and I was hooked. Since then I listened to all of their albums.  Then I heard of their new album \\"Kveikur\\" being a new and more aggressive sound. I was curious and looked up their first two singles \\"Brennisteinn\\" and \\"Isjaki\\". The former had a very industrial heavy sound and reminded me of Silversun Pickups a bit. I liked the feeling it gave me. It was almost an apocalyptic feeling. Then I heard \\"Isjaki\\", and I was blown away by the beauty of it. It was very upbeat and poppy, but still had the heavenly unique Sigur Ros vibe. I was sold, I wanted this album. I also heard that Sigur Ros signed with the record label \\"XL\\" which mostly features indie music. The most well known of the label are \\"Vampire Weekend\\", \\"Adele\\", and \\"Radiohead\\", so I was anxious to hear how signing to \\"XL\\" would change the music. There have been hints that this album will be the most commercial sounding as well. Like I said, I listen to all kinds of music and this new album was released on the same day as many other albums I was anticipating including Kanye Wests new controversial \\"Yeezus\\". I was standing in Best Buy for 30 minutes contemplating what to buy. Finally Idecided on \\"Kviekur\\", and I am betting I was the only one that day to bring that album to the register. But I didn't care, I just wanted to hear the beauty of this album. So I listened to it three times before I decided to review it and hear is a track by track overview!<br /><br />1. Brennisteinn: This is by far the heaviest song on the album, and it still has very divine vocals. The songs deep bass gives it an \\"End of the World\\" feel. Near the halfway mark of this nearly 8 minute epic, the song changes and becomes faster in the vain of songs from the band Silversun Pickups! Very beautifully haunting. The last minute and a half is a very relaxing recovery from the beautifully musical aggressiveness that just happened in the song.  The song was also used perfectly in a gameplay trailer for \\"Assassins Creed 4\\" as well.<br />2. Hrafntinna: This is another hauntingly beautiful song! If Brennisteinn was the War, this song is the footage of the aftermath. I mean that in the best way. The vocals from Jon are as beautiful and soaring as always!<br />3. Isjaki: Definitely the most radio ready song. Very upbeat and gorgeous. The vocals kind of remind me of the band \\"Beach House\\". This song brings about so many emotions. It is simply perfection in music form. This is the type of song that would play while you make love in a dream. This song will make you wanna dance and for some reason it makes me feel nostalgic. While listening to this song think of that special someone, or \\"the one who got away\\" and see how you feel! My definite favorite of the album.<br />4. Yfirborð: The song starts off slow and peaceful, with another haunting vocal effect in the background. While Jon sings gracefully along with the beautiful music the tempo becomes faster, but doesn't turn into a dance song. It somehow manages to speed up during the chorus without fully becoming an upbeat song. It's so relaxing. The song makes me feel like I am soaring through the clouds and looking at the landscape below!<br />5. Stormur: The song begins slowly with powerful vocals that slightly remind me of the Enigma song \\"Return to Innocence\\". The song then gains momentum and the tempo really picks up. Much like the song \\"Isjaki\\" this song could be released to US radio even though its not in English. I love it. Such a powerful song.  This song can be compared to the song \\"Saeglopur\\" from the bands album \\"Takk\\".  The chiming sound in this song is so infectious.  Definitely one of Sigur Ros's best!<br />6. Kveikur: The title track with a industrial influence like \\"Brennisteinn\\". The song has a big stadium feeling to it.  At first I didn't like it that much, but after repeated listens I started to feel the music and love it.  This is commone with Sigur Ros music!<br />7. Rafstraumur: After the slight heaviness of \\"Kveikur\\", this song takes you down a notch to just sit back and groove along. The upbeat nature of this song reminds me of Silversun Pickups again. This is a great song to listen to while sailing along a beach in my opinion!<br />8. Bláþráður: More powerful vocals to start off the song. This song brings about a feeling of loneliness and happiness at the same time. The drums stream along. There is a haunting vocal effect you can faintly hear in the background. The drumming in this song reminds me of \\"Arcade Fire\\" surprisingly!<br />9. Var: A relaxing piano led instrumental to close the album. I like it. It is very peaceful and could be used in Movie soundtracks, but I personally wouldn't listen to it as much as the rest of the albums songs. Still a great closer!<br /><br />So Sigur Ros has done it again. They have managed to make a more popular sounding record without sounding like just another pop band.  Though this album is a bit more aggressive than their other albums, it still isn't truly heavy.  The only two really heavy songs are \\"Brennisteinn\\" and the title track.  The heaviest song from the band in my opinion is still \\"Untitled 8\\".  The songs are definitely consistently more upbeat than their usual style though.  The vocals are amazing even though I do not understand Icelandic. This is the sound of dreams and beautiful nightmares!  I personally enjoy not knowing what they are singing. It adds to the mystery of the music and allows me to project my own emotions to the songs!  Though I love all of Sigur Ros's albums, this one has to be my favorite one since \\"Takk\\".  If you are a Sigur Ros fan, this is a must. If you are new to the band, this is also recommended! If you like good music, this is the perfect album to buy. The great thing about Sigur Ros is that their music is timeless.  Their music doesn't fall into the 80s, 90s, or the 2000s.  Sigur Ros music is eternal.  If you are new to Sigur Ros, be prepared, because once you start listening to Sigur Ros, no other music will compare.  I look forward to the emotional journeys this album will continue to take me on!
B00DBSZJRM|5.0|I grew up with the old traditional versions of the Grimm fairy tales (when there wasn't usually a happy ending) so I do enjoy darker versions of fairy tales.  This had a fun twist by ignoring tradition just a little, with a good story line, and a bit of modern edge which they played off of (not to the extent of A Knight's Tale, but along that line).  Enjoyable cast and filmography.

B005CRQ4GU|5.0|This book is great. I thought it was funny that Greg was trying to impress the girl he wanted to go on the dance with.
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|I have always loved Kanye Wests music.  I never really liked his personality in public, but I love his music.  All of his albums are Hip Hop classics.  His first three releases were all Grammy nominated for Album of the Year.  \\"Graduation\\" changed Hip Hop forever with its stadium influenced sound.  Then again, he changed how rap can sound with his album \\"808s and Heartbreaks\\" by adding autotune and giving the genre a more experimental and emotional sound.  The album paved the way for artists such as Kid Cudi and Drake.  Then in 2010 he released what can arguably be labeled his ultimate masterpiece, \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\".  It was an epic experimental album that paid tribute to all of the genres Kanye explored through his career with many additional new sounds.  The album was expected to WIN album of the year at the Grammys, but was ultimately snubbed of even a nomination.  Most people, including West himself, blame the fact that he released another hip hop classic soon after with Jay Z, the greatest Hip Hop collaboration album of all time \\"Watch the Throne\\".  So 3 years pass since his last solo release and many were wondering how he would top his masterpiece \\"MBDTF\\".  He started speaking about how he didn't want \\"radio\\" songs on his new album and how there would be no singles.  At first I didn't really think it would be a great album when I saw the bad quality videos on YouTube of his song \\"New Slaves\\".  The song was good, but I didn't really get excited for the new album just from that song.  The live videos of the song \\"Black Skinhead\\" didn't help either.  I am not one to get offended by Kanyes lyrics, I just personally thought the song was unappealing.  People started hating on Kanye for these two new songs and I was starting to think the new album would be horrible.  I did feel a bit of hope when I found out that Daft Punk were producing a few tracks, and that the always amazing Justin Vernon of Bon Iver would help out.  Well it was finally releasedand I must say, though it doesn't top his last album, it does stand out among his collection of classics.  Many think it is another masterpiece, and maybe it is, but the truth is, it was just over hyped.  The album is very, bipolar, in a good way.  Here is a quick track by track overview.<br /><br />1.  On Sight:  This song is okay.  It has a good robotic vibe.  The lyrics are okay for Kanyes standards.  A minute into the song there is a slight interlude that has some nice soul.  I found out this was one of the tracks the legendary Daft Punk produced, and honestly, I was disappointed with it then.  It is a good song for your workout playlist though.  7.5/10<br />2.  Black Skinhead:  Many will be offended just by the title, but will have no idea that it isn't a racist song at all.  The lyrics are great.  The beat is amazing, and very similar to Marilyn Mansons song \\"Beautiful People\\".  The song is somewhat catchy, but it gets tiresome quickly, and the screams of Kanye during the chorus are very annoying.  I can sorta see this released as a single based on its pumping nature, but I still don't see it as a great song.  Still better than the horrible live version that was on YouTube though.  Another Daft Punk produced song surprisingly.  I expected more.  This one is a grower.  8/10<br />3.  I am a God:  I know many people will hate the song just because of the title.  This is something Kanye is good at, making people mad!  I kinda like the vibe of the song, but it also gets tiresome quickly.  Most people don't realize he isn't claiming to be GOD, he is saying he is A God.  He is a god of hip hop, you cant deny that.  Despite the egotistical lyrics, this is a great song to work out to.  The pumping house beat is addicting.  Daft Punk produced this track too, and I'm not surprised.  This is radio potential if they cut out the annoying ending that contains screams and heavy breathing.  9/10<br />4.  New Slaves:  Good song, but honestly, I skip over it.  The album versionis refreshing after the annoying live version that was released prior.  Again, for people who get offended by the title, the song isn't a racist song at all.  Frank Ocean makes an appearance at the end, but it doesn't save the song for me.  The song has a similar feel to the songs on Kanyes GOOD music album \\"Cruel Summer\\", mostly the song \\"Clique\\".  8/10<br />5.  Hold My Liquor:  Just when I was beginning to feel a bit disappointed with the album, this song came next.  I think this is the best song on the album.  It has a very new and chill sound.  Chief Keef surprisingly sings the chorus in a catchy way.  I never really liked Chief Keef but he did well on this song.  First the Chief Keef chorus starts and it just sounds okay.  The verses by Kanye are amazing and heartfelt with a screeching industrial guitar in the background with a very relaxing beat.  Then the chorus with Chief Keef kicks in, but this time with amazing guitar work who I assume is from Justin Vernon from Bon Iver, who also does amazing vocal work throughout the song.  There is a tasty guitar solo in there too that fits so well into this relaxing song.  You haven't heard a hip hop song like this.  Only from Yeezus.  This can be released as a single.  This song saved the album for me.  10/10<br />6.  I'm In It:  A great song to follow the previous masterpiece of a song.  The beat is very industrial and abstract.  The lyrics are typical Kanye bragging, but it's amazing.  Before Kanyes verse a Jamaican rapper steals the show with his nice speed.  Then surprisingly Justin Vernon of Bon Iver makes another perfect vocal appearance!  Futuristic hip hop song.  9.5/10<br />7.  Blood on The Leaves:  Great soulful song.  Kanye uses slight autotune and it works so well.  I'm not a fan of Autotune, but Kanye is one of the few who make it work so well.  The sample is similar to Kanyes older song \\"I Wonder\\" from the \\"Graduation\\" album.  Another song that saves the album!  The beat is so hype and perfect!  I don'tknow what else to say.  I love it.  10/10<br />8.  Guilt Trip:  Another great song.  I thought Daft Punk produced it, because it has the most Daft Punk feeling vibe, but sadly they didn't.  Still a great infectious song.  Kid Cudi makes a vocal appearance near the end singing with his uniquely awesome voice.  Still better than any of the first 4 tracks.  9/10<br />9.  Send It Up:  Another Daft Punk produced song, and you can tell.  The chorus is catchy but this is just an okay song among the recent great songs.  I can see this played in the club though.  8/10<br />10.  Bound 2:  The final song kicks off perfectly.  Arguably the most soulful song.  It contains Kanyes iconic sampling of a classic song.  Reminds me of the song \\"Devil in a New Dress\\" from \\"MBDTF\\", and surprisingly this one is better.  Singer Charlie Wilson makes a vocal appearance and he sounds great with the song.  The song has a very romantic hip hop sound, but the lyrics get pretty explicit. Still a perfect album closer that left me wanting so much more!  10/10<br /><br />*First Impressions*<br />So Mr. West has made another classic album.  The only reason the album isn't 5 stars is because the first 4 tracks just weren't up to par with the masterpiece quality of the rest of the album.  Many will love those tracks to death, but I got tired of them quickly.  The album as a whole has this industrial rock influenced sound sometimes similar to early \\"Nine Inch Nails\\" music, but with more Hip Hop elements incorporated.  I recommend the songs \\"Hold My Liquor\\" and \\"Bound 2\\" the most.  Though I would say the last 6 tracks are all the true Highlights and they have the most replay value.  This album will get polarized reviews.  Many are calling it another masterpiece, and many are calling it trash.  It all depends on taste.  But you can't deny that this album is another landmark hip hop album that will surely change the way the genre sounds the way Kanyes other releases have.  I have a feeling Kanye might getanother nomination for Album of The Year after being snubbed with his last true masterpiece.  So if you like good Hip Hop and aren't offended easily then this album is perfect.  This can appeal to anyone who likes good experimental music.  Many have also compared it's experimental genre bending nature to the band Radioheads landmark album \\"Kid A\\", which is actually a compliment!  I also think that like \\"Kid A\\", this album will be hailed as a classic in years to come.  Another good release from the Hip Hop genre this week was J.Coles more commercial sounding \\"Born Sinner\\", but it doesn't stand out like Yeezus.  If you are looking for beautiful music that isn't in the hip hop category then pick up Sigur Ros's 2013 release \\"Kveikur\\".  This album is for music listeners with minds more open to new and different sounds.  Listen to it twice before you form an opinion though!<br /><br />*New thoughts after more repeated listens*<br />I have grown slightly more fond of the first 4 tracks now.  \\"Black Skinhead\\" in particular has become a hit for me.  I still don't see it as a favorite of mine, and it is still not up to par with the last 6 tracks.  But I have heard it in a trailer for the movie \\"The Wolf of Wall Street\\" and I found myself feeling pumped and rapping along.  For some reason \\"Black Skinheads\\" has become very appealing to me and apparently the country.  It is starting to have the same appeal as Kanyes single \\"Power\\" which has become a popular choice for commercials and movie trailers.  It is even being released as the first single surprisingly.  As for the rest of the album, I still love the last 6 tracks the most.  I keep discovering new layers to each song with repeated listens.  I will try to revisit the album every now and again since the music is amazing, but too exhausting for constant repeated listening.<br /><br />**Months Later**<br />I decided to give this another listen again.  Suddenly I am listening closer to the lyrics of all the songs.  The first 4tracks too.  \\"I am a God\\" is suddenly one of my favorite controversial songs ever.  The album sounds new and refreshing and nostalgic for some reason.  I am changing my score to a perfect 5 out of 5 now.  This is a real album.  This will be considered a classic milestone for Hip Hop in years to come.  Truly Kanyes \\"Kid A\\".<br /><br />**After Bound 2 success**<br />The album didn't have any mega hits like previous albums.  Black Skinhead has been used in commercials and trailers but hasn't charted well.  But after Kim Kardashian starred in the controversial music video of the song \\"Bound 2\\", things changed.  The song has gotten really popular and is sure to be the big hit of the album.  It is also reigniting interest in the album as it made me come back and listen again.  Once again I'm discovering new elements to the album.  Masterpiece!
1609611543|5.0|I am a person who loves life and wants to take super good care of my body, so I picked up this book and it made complete sense to me.  I am nearing 60 and a very self-disciplined eater.  I rarely ate sugar or fast food, and loved vegetables and a little meat.  After reading this book I decided to go wheat free.  My blood pressure was rising with age even though I ate very cautiously, and I wanted to reverse that.  After 3 weeks on the diet (doing EVERYTHING he suggested), I started feeling much better, I lost weight, and my blood pressure came down by 10 points.  Now after almost 3 months on the diet I am thinner than I have been in a decade, even though I eat lots of cheese, avacados, olives and olive oil, dark chocolate, and tons of nuts.  I don't feel tired in the afternoon, I sleep well, and I do NOT have cravings.  I love how he says you can even have home-made cheesecake for breakfast (who would have thought?). It has taken a great deal of self-discipline to give up bread and other yummy things that I was used to, but it has been completely worth it!  I plan to stay on this \\"diet\\" forever. I only have one body and I love life too much to jeopardize it in any way.

0060836253|1.0|Ummm...I'm pretty well read.  several college degrees.<br />This book was awful.  I mean, the author didn't miss a single cliche, poor stultifying dialog, predictable characters, AWFUL character development (ummm....his dead wife calls him ....\\"puppy.\\"?)  Wednesday, one of the main characters, is about as cliched as it gets.  So too are the eastern Europeans, the midwestern Wisconsinites, there are characters randomly thrown in with absolutely no value (like the gratuitous Arab cab driver gay sex scene).  His writing is absolutely high school level.  Sure he occasionally hits on all cylinders; the description of the slaver ship coming to the States is riveting, but the words that come to mind to describe the rest of the book - predictable, corny, hackneyed, cliched?  i considered bagging this several times.  Plot was occasionally interesting but I figured it out half way through, and believe me, I'm not usually that sharp.  Thrown together and bizarre if not downright stupid \\"battle\\" scene.  Ungodly long drawn out (get ON WITH IT already) scenes, like Shadow's vigil on the tree.  Do yourself a favor, read something well written.  This was a clever high school level work.  If that intrigues you then this is for you.  If you are a college grad, or college professor, you need to get a literary life.
B00BHU2A7I|3.0|Hitchcock is a movie which tells the of the relationship between Alfred Hitchcock and wife Alma Reville during the filming of Psycho in 1959.<br /><br />I will admit that this wasn't on my list of movies I just had to watch but I figured I would give it a chance and see it.  Hitchcock is an interesting take on the back story of the making of Psycho, which basically made Hitchcock a legend in suspense movie making.<br /><br />Both Anthony Hopkins and Helen Mirren do an excellent job in their roles. The makeup on Hopkins makes you almost believe it is Hitchcock himself in the movie.<br /><br />Although not as in depth of Hitchcock the man as I would have liked, the movie is worthwhile to watch as it was better than I expected it would be.

B0014JKJHK|3.0|I ordered a pair of similar Crocs for my wife years ago. She works at a restaurant and needed something safe and comfortable. She loved them, and they served her well.<br /><br />So when it came time for a new pair, she wanted the same ones. Unfortunately it seems that Specialist is no longer available in non-slip, so we went with these, as they are nearly identical. Again, she was happy -- so happy that when I needed work shoes I got some for myself as well.<br /><br />But after only a couple months (shortly after receiving mine), she showed me that the non-slip sole is bubbling up and coming off of her shoes. After two weeks mine are still fine, but only time will tell. Hopefully she just got a bad pair, because finding shoes that are a good fit (pun intended) is no easy task.

B00BXUG0KU|4.0|I really wanted to give this a 4 1/2 stars.  I'm impressed that she played piano as well as arranging the songs and producing the album.
B004HW7JMY|5.0|Love the series.  Kept original characters is one of the things I like about it.  Story is awesome!  Glad they put this season together.
B006CHML4I|5.0|After reading the reviews I went ahead and ordered this watch. And I am glad I did. Once it came I played with it to get some wind into it and set the time. That was a week ago and I have not needed to adjust it again. This watch has kept great time but to be fair I do keep it in a watch winder when I am not wearing it. The strap is comfortable and the watch is easy to read and this includes the day and date. Two things I did not like was one the crown is a little small and hard to get a hold of and two amazon does not fill in the warranty card. Would I buy another Seiko 5 - yes. Would I recommend one to a friend - yes. For a great basic automatic watch at a great price there is no need to look further.<br /><br />After a year of use.<br />Well I got a year of use on this watch now and it still runs well.I wear it to work a least 3 times a week and the watch has acquired 2 scratches to the crystal. I sometimes do work on mechanical equipment so a couple of scratches I can live with. I would still buy again.
157330087X|4.0|Great retrospective on Stevie from a top notch group of performers.  We watch this quite frequently, and it also is great for background noise while you just do stuff around the house.
B008OOYALE|3.0|I just love the game. It is very addictive. I enjoy relaxing and playing daily. Why did I give it 3 stars did you ask?  The price of clearing land is high for expansion and after clearing you then need to pay to remove brush , rocks, trees and more! Spending all my time earning coins to expand is not fun. Breeding dragons and visiting neighbors is  fun. The game would be 5 stars if not for the cost of expanding.
B004I744AS|4.0|I like this app for the easy word search, and its vast descriptions of the words I type in. The games are fun but aren't easy. Spelling bees easy mode is harder than it looks.
0547884591|4.0|I have read most of what Tim Ferriss has written to date and to the nay sayers out here the only thing I would say is that Mr. Ferriss can only merely show the way you as the reader will definitely need to do the serious heavy lifting! That said I have found his writings quite useful in developing a personal insight and structure that has in turn translated into long term fulfilment and enjoyment.<br /><br />If you're into seriously changing your life for the better, learning new skills and overall just taking a path towards a higher level of evolution than this book fits really nicely in that backpack you might wanna take along for the journey!
B006GWO5NE|5.0|The Kindle Fire USB cable along with the PowerFast Charger fixed my problem of Kindle Fire failing to charge immediately.
B006T3RM08|5.0|We use this for our mac mini at home, which we have connected to a LED TV.  It allows us to control the computer from the couch, without having to put the trackpad on a solid surface.  It also has a clean look to it, something you don't mind putting next to an apple product.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Wow all the songs are great and have their own unique sound.  I'm so sick of the songs on the radio because they are all electronic generic autotuned crap but with Hanson you get real lyrics with real music.  It's hard to pick a favorite because they are all awesome!  I give them all 5 stars.  You get a little bit of rock, a little bit of blues and some pop!
B001GGY3WS|5.0|One of the best written albums ever. The lyrics are so moving and poetic, coupled with the brilliant playing, makes this one of my all time favorite albums.
B000EXDS5M|5.0|Paul Newman, Robert Redford and Katherine Ross, three great actors, great directing, great camera work, great characters, great story. Great movie.
B007MDB71O|5.0|Really enjoyed this movie.  Looks great and there was a LOT to enjoy in the story. Very very fun escapist entertainment and the type of action // escape movie that (sadly) doesn't get made much anymore outside of \\"comic book\\" based movies.
1451695195|5.0|Extraordinarily courageous and exciting.. admits past errors , recognizes the need for really looking at evidence instead of just blindly accepting the common &#34;scientific Wisdom&#34;.
0312360258|5.0|This is a great series and reads quickly. I bought this book on sale and thought it was ok, nothing great, but ok. The writing was good, the main character was funny and likeable, and the story was intresting with the vampire school. I enjoyed it and decided to read the next one. That is when things get interesting. The story picks up into a massive, deep, and complex plot that had me at the edge of my seat (that's pretty impressive for a book). The characters deve from being simple to deep and complex, romance is everywhere and so is the danger. If you like vampire books, then read not only this, but the whole series. Word to the wise though, buy them 2 at a time instead of finding yourself at a cliffhanger and not a brands and noble in sight.
B0091LS07E|1.0|I heard her sing on Oprah and loved her sound and the song.  I loved her voice so thought I would enjoy the whole CD.  Wrong.  This was a waste of money,  The song she sang on Oprah is totally different than the tempo and voice on the rest of the CD.  It is awful.  Make sure you don't make the same assumption I did and waste your money as well.
B00005N7Z1|5.0|A very entertaining movie. I especially like the way Peter Weller moves when he walks, mimicking how a robot would move. Very nice, well done.<br />But mostly I am amazed at the accuracy of the writers prediction of a world that has allowed corporations to take over all aspects of our society, even police protection. It accurately describes how the lust for profits by sociopathic CEO class men and women would ultimately corrupt and eventually destroy the ability of the common citizen to live a safe and satisfying life.
B009IH0ICG|5.0|I have the large version of this starter. Bought this one to start smaller amounts of charcoal to replenish the cooker when smoking or long rotisserie cooks on the 22&#34; inch Weber grill. It works great. This size would be perfect for smaller charcoal BBQ's and when starting less that a full kettle. It is well built and is recommended.

B002QYNIHU|5.0|Basically a good collection for any DBZ fans, with good paint job and articulation. Is about 5-6inch tall, and is only 6 with the hair. There only two faces which is dissapointing since I wish they would have more to work with. Overall is a awesome figure that currently is at a low price, and you should get it before the price goes up.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Top notch. This is the app I use and I've tried them all. There is nothing I would change I give it an A+

B002GJU54E|5.0|I laughed and chuckled my way through this book just as I have with the entire Plum series. Evanovich has managed to provide readers with an unending supply of Plum adventures to write about.  If you have the rest of the Plum series this book belongs in your library as well.
B001O1O71C|5.0|I liked the movie so I decided t  read the book. The book was better than the movie but isn't that always the case.

B009UX2YAC|5.0|Really fun collect a lot of coins to get a lot of characters some of them are hard to get
B007THA4FI|4.0|J.K. does it again with a story that will propel your reading simply by the characters. The ending is tragic, but leaves you feeling full of emotion, as the best stories always do. Nothing like Harry Potter, and yet everything like Harry Potter, when it comes to the story, Rowling sends you weaving through a seemingly endless maze of small-town gossip, politics, and lives. Yet when finished, the book will leave you reflecting on these characters, their lives, and the true realities Rowling uncovers in a most heart-wrenching way.
0738206679|5.0|Just like Bursts, this show how things are connected, and starts to show you how the Power Rule is in many aspects of life.

B0084IG8TM|5.0|I've never read the book or watched the movie before but I've seen it 5 times since I purchased the dvd. Thanks!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|We've watched this movie several times, and I finally wanted my own copy of it.  As a special ed teacher, it gives me insight into the children I work with.  Even our son, who was in college at the time, enjoyed it.  My mother-in-law actually stayed awake through the movie when we watched it with her.  Knowing that the movie is fairly true to Temple Grandin's life story is what makes it captivating, and the actresses and actors do an awesome job portraying their characters.
B00CO52NLI|5.0|I love this app! its one of my most used. its fun and the animals are really cute. its a great game for people who wqant to be vets or love animals. you could buy more animal verieties and they are cheap for .99 cents. really cute game :)
1781162646|5.0|Stephen King, who needs no introduction, returns with a short novel in Joyland, published by Titan books as part of the Hard Case Crime series. But even though the book is under three hundred pages, King easily tells a full and fascinating story that fans and non-King readers will easily enjoy.<br /><br />Devin Jones is spending the summer at Joyland, an amusement park on the sunny coast of South Carolina. Jones isn't doing so well; not sure whether he wants to stay in college, plus it's the early seventies and everything seems uncertain. And the other thing is the love of his live has just broken his heart and he kind of wants his world to end.<br /><br />But then he starts working at Joyland, where they don't just sell cotton candy and prizes and rides, but most importantly, they sell fun! He begins to learn the carny life, the carny talk, and the general running of the amusement park, doing a great job as well as being the best guy at \\"wearing the fur.\\" Joyland has its mighty Ferris wheel, reaching to the stars, the various carnies who have been working there for years and have their own interesting eccentricities, and the Horror House.<br /><br />Every amusement park needs its one horror ride, and Horror House is it for Joyland, and this is the ride that has the dark story about it, because some years ago a girl was murdered on the ride, her throat slashed by her supposed boyfriend, her body dumped to the side of the track. She wasn't found until the early hours of the morning by the cleanup crew; her murderer has never been found. It is said that Horror House is now haunted and sometimes when you're on the ride, you might see the ghost of her body floating beside you in the car, that red slit throat looking like a wide smile.<br /><br />Joyland shows how much of a better writer Stephen King has become over the last decade or so, as you have a thrilling horror tale at the heart of the story, but you also have a wonderful character in the teenager, Devin Jones, who has his whole life ahead of him, but feels it is over with his broken heart. Perhaps King was pulling on his own past experience to give this story life and reality that will move the reader, making Joyland stick with them long after they've finished the book.<br /><br />Originally written on June 12, 2013 ©Alex C.

0316228532|2.0|After the unfathomable success of the Harry Potter series, with over 450 million copies sold worldwide, likely making it one of the biggest phenomena of our lifetimes, J. K. Rowling is now back with her first new book in five years.  She now turns to a much more adult story about a quaint little English town where everything is most certainly not as it seems.<br /><br />In the idyllic west country town of Pagford, where things pass at their own pace and everything stays pretty much the same, a change is about to happen.  A respected citizen of the community, Barry Fairbrother suffers a sudden brain aneurysm and dies unexpectedly.  It is a very sad time for the family and for the community, as he touched many lives during his time, as well as being an important member of the town's council.  But Barry's passing is also the lighting of a spark that sets off an explosive chain reaction, as the empty space on the town council starts many wondering who should fill his seat, and a number of unlikely candidates come out of the woodwork.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy is also the story about a number of the characters of this community, and how they begin to act and react when this person who had an effect on their lives is gone and is no longer there to provide aid and advice.  The book is by no means a happy novel, as these characters make terrible decisions that lead them down a downward spiral of despair.  By the end of the book, the reader is left hoping their might be some sort of cathartic uplift, but Rowling is going for a harsh true-to-life approach here, where things don't all of a sudden get magically better.<br /><br />Overall the book comes off as a letdown, slow and dragging at points, with nothing to drive the reader along to keep reading, as things get worse and worse for just about everyone it seems.  Rowling is perhaps pulling from some earlier experiences in her life before her fame and riches, as there are characters dealing with drug addiction, poverty,marital problems, and a whole host of unsavory issues.  The book also comes off somewhat amateurish, as Rowling constantly references many places throughout this imaginary town that confuse the reader, and could have easily been aided with a handy map at the beginning of the book.  Then there is the large host of characters, featuring many couples of about the same age, some even with the same first letters of their names, which often makes things confusing, and could've been helped with a simple cast list.  Finally, there is the constantly switching P.O.V. from paragraph to paragraph, without any break in between, so that the reader becomes quite untethered and lost at times.<br /><br />The Casual Vacancy was an experiment by Rowling in seeing what happens to a town when an important member dies and all the people he'd had an effect on begin making bad decisions that then effect the rest of the town.  By the end of the book the reader is sad over the events of the book, though Rowling makes it clear that if any of the characters had made the decision to not think of themselves for a moment and to notice that nearby person suffering and help them, things would have come out quite differently.  But because this social message is buried in the clunky format and pitfalls of the book with no satisfactory resolution, the reader is left wondering what was the point of reading this book to the last page.<br /><br />Originally written on January 8, 2013 ©Alex C.

B0069G5Z9K|5.0|this game is sooooooo fun and adicting. I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!<br />I think EVERYONE should get this. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!!!!!!
B006H5120E|5.0|Loved it again and again because my original DVD somehow grew legs.  The colors and music are just classic to enjoy.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|I watched this movie not having read the books and really liked it! I did not know it was a book series when I started watching the movie, but when the movie ended with so many unanswered questions, I checked online and saw it was a book series. I love to read so I decided I should just read the book to have my questions answered...but it didn't really help. It seems that good movie ideas are on a slow moving train(or a stopped one) and producers are just making books into movies to make up for lack of imagination. Usually the movie sucks because the book is always better, but in the case of the Beautiful Creatures movie, I am bothered as to why they even tried to make the book into a movie. There are about 10% of similarities between the book and the movie. Of course the book is better, but I did also like the movie. It just really bothers me of how different the two are. I wish the producers had decided to just use some of the ideas from the book and make a movie called something different, making a small credit to the authors of the casters series for the inspiration. It is just annoying knowing the movie was made after such a good book, and it would have been better to say it was an \\"original\\" plot with different character names, a different town, and just make a good movie with inspiration from the book. Because the way it is now makes the movie discredit the greatness of the books, and for those of us who have read the books not be able to truly appreciate some of the originality of the movie. I definitely recommend the movie if you have not read the books because it is a good movie. But for us book lovers, books are movies for the soul, and no movie can truly captivate anyone in the same way a book can.
B0015DYIH2|5.0|I recommend this book and movie saga to everyone<br /><br />I wish Stephanie Meyer would write more books for the twilight saga<br /><br />This is a good book<br /><br />I recommend this book and the other twilight saga books<br /><br />I Recommend the movies to you too
B000ICLRIE|5.0|Beyond the action and the breath of the pictures there is an excellent story .The Directors cut helped me better understand what I already thought of as an excellent film.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|This game had a really good mix of HOB scenes, unique puzzles, multiple locations &amp; an interesting  story line.  That's what I want in a game - &amp; this one delivered on all those points &amp; more.  It was decent in length as well.  I didn't experience any bugs playing it on my Kindle Fire, &amp; would highly recommend it to anyone who enjoys playing HOB games mixed with great characters/story, unusual locations, &amp; fun &amp; challenging puzzles mixed throughout.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|We all love this movie.  I have the Kevin Costner version and I thought there could be no other one like it but this one hit it beautifully
B009RH9FR6|2.0|Not a very user friendly case. It does not close completely unless you use the elastic strap.  Very inconvenient and what happens when the strap stretches out?
B003K1EYM6|5.0|The easiest way to get photos to your ipad.  Usually once I have bought and item and lose it...I hate to have to buy another. I happily forked over the bucks to buy this again.  Fast and fool proof..a must have for your fadt connection between camera pics and  ipad!
B000W967UQ|5.0|Every story I have read is a unique piece of art.  It takes a real artist to create humble characters of Gods,man and even death.  I cannot wait to continue reading the Discworld series.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|A very simple, but functional app.  The battery life estimate is very useful, and the display is easy to read with just a glance.  Highly recommended.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|i love this game. i thought you would have to spend mony to get things.i would rate this game who loves animals like me.
B000FC1HBY|3.0|Good book by George R.R. Martin.  The story gets more complex as war ravages Westeros and old friends become foes.  Magic and supernatural elements start taking a more important role in the story compared with Game of Thrones.  More mystery threads are open and you keep wondering what will happen to the main characters.  I can't wait to start reading A Storm of Swords.
B00BNWWVFG|4.0|This review contains no specific descriptions of plot events. I saw this in the theater so my review will not include an analysis of the Bluray/DVD technical aspects- the picture quality or sound quality. This review is only an \\"IMO\\" review of the theatrical film itself. Coming from Soderbergh, who's stuff is usually different from most mainstream cinema, \\"Side effects\\" was about what I expected, but more twisted. There's always something in his films that pique my interest. \\"Side effects\\" drew me in and then had me going from being into it to not being into it at various points. I found the film was engaging in spite of some inconsistencies. I also liked Rooney Mara in this, very good performance. Coming from Soderbergh, the use of digital photography, amber hues, and an image that sometimes looks a little pasty on screen was no surprise either.<br />As \\"Side effects\\" moves along, the plot goes a bit haywire. I still think it's a movie that is well worthwhile, but it feels more like Soderbergh's political statement on the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street/insider trading, which is fine by me, but the audience side of the equation could have been better judged. The basic idea itself is not so absurd, but is certainly carried over the top. I don't know, maybe he wants that question to be asked, how sensationalist is this? Severe drug side effects, to include bizarre behavior have been documented, and is anyone going to prove there is no unethical money made on what Wall street, the government, doctor's, and drug companies do lol. Maybe there's a deeper irony at work here. The films main weakness is the plot trips up in technical details- which Soderbergh usually pays more attention to. The plot discrepancies reduce the impact of the film as it morphs between its pharmaceutical side effect theme and its insider trading theme. It sometimes comes across as farcical- but it is no more absurd than what we see in the real world- The railroading of drugs onto the market, enthusiastic dispensal by doctors, the astronomical profits of drug companies; and the money wall street, and people on Capitol hill get on insider trading.<br />\\"Side effects\\" is on the extreme side, is deliberately paced (which anyone familiar with a lot of his stuff won't be surprised at) and try's to cover too much ground as it draws to its conclusion. The acceleration of events- from the slow start to the final act might leave some viewers a little confused. I still liked it better than many other recent offerings. As \\"Psychological Thrillers\\" go, this one will keep you entertained and get you thinking. I liked the concept of \\"side effects\\", and it has the crazy ending of a thriller. It was one of those movies that does'nt quite reach its full potential, and ends up being 3 or 4 stars instead of 5. I give it 3.5 stars. I'd Recommend to people who like a cerebral thriller, and to fans of Rooney Mara.<br />Update: I've since gotten the bluray version of this movie- and found both the sound and picture of the bluray transfer to be very good. Versus how I remember the film looking in the theater, things seem faithful to the color palette of Soderbergh, and everything is a little cleaner and clearer, so maybe they used some \\"DNR\\" in producing the bluray, but it is nothing unqualified, and in this case actually improves over what I saw in the theater.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|this was a good game I am just waiting for chapter 2 I hope it is as good or even better but no falling through the ground please and please make it free
B004UID2LC|2.0|This app started work for l month then it won't let me tip in the word.i only recamend this app to somone who likes to wast their time and i am not that person,but i really don't  recamend it to anyone.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a good game,  makes you think. finding clues becomes an obsessions.  not finding them keeps you thinking at nigh
B00AAQRNQ8|4.0|This mouse by Anker was better than expected.<br /><br />The mouse itself works very well. Wasn't that thrilled that I had to download drivers from the website, but after that, I was pleased with everything. Being able to customize the DPI and having it available on the fly is awesome. Being able to customize the color of the Anker logo on the mouse is pretty cool, even though I wish I could have that same color (or another color) for the scroll wheel.<br /><br />The thumb grip doesn't really grip. My thumb rests comfortably but isn't being held there by the grip. Not even a little moisture is able to make the grip more effective.<br /><br />Being able to add weights to the mouse was nice. Getting the cover off of it was a tiny bit frustrating because it wouldn't come off initially. Had to give the base of the mouse a good smack before it fell out.<br /><br />The macro button works, even though I rarely use it.<br /><br />Overall, for those that may be new to PC gaming, or for those that are on a budget, this mouse does a pretty good job.<br /><br />UPDATE: 3/29/15 - After nearly two years with the Anker mouse, I still love it. Haven't had any issues with it. No broken parts, no parts that were unresponsive, and everything works as well as when I first received it.
B004J4WNL2|5.0|If you know anyone who is a listener and not a talker and you want to know more about them OR you are one of those people, read this book.  It is non-fiction but an easy read.  We need to celebrate the less chatty in among us.
0345803485|2.0|Hmmmm.... I hardly ever read fiction but with so much fuss about this book I thought I'd give it a try.  This book should really be in the teen section.  It's written very simply...which makes it an easy and quick read.  Nothing wrong in that I suppose but even the story and plot are not exciting, in any way!  There's no suspense, no thrilling moments, no excitement.  I felt I was just turning pages and reading like it was the first one all over again.  The female character, Ana, what's with biting her lip?!  every other page it mentions it.  Surely there's more that can said about sexual attraction than just describing a girl biting her lip?! The story and the way it was written just didn't do it for me.  I agree with a lot of other reviews on here.... it feels like it was written by an teenager who was dreaming about the perfect man who had all the money to go with it.  I'll pass on books II and III.  There are much better erotic romantic novels out there....but I'm going back to history, science and religion.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Very addictive and a great way to pass time!!  If you lobe solitate then you will.love this app.  Many different options of cards and backgrounds.  you can even customize!
B000ZOXDFA|5.0|I REALLY enjoyed the cinematography of this film. That alone is worth watching the film for. It is actually a part 2. The packaging on it should let the viewer know this, instead you learn of it in the BONUS section of the DVD. Cate Blanchett is an excellent actress, who can transform herself in such a way as to put you in the  space of the person she's playing; and she did so with this historical character.. AS most, I've heard of her or read something about her, but in this movie--though embellished; It's Elizabeth you focus on and feel for. You see the responsiblity her life contained, the stress and her strengths and weaknesses. The movie has historical background, but it is Character driven, so that is what a viewer who watches this movie should really bend toward; and it would be good to view the first part first, it would put some continuity to this one.
B00CU8OVIM|5.0|He definitely won't let Nas down with this one. One of my favorite albums of the year. I hope he slowly starts changing the game like he wants. I'm getting sick of all these guys just rapping about how much money they have or how many women they get with. It's not clever anymore. Thanks J. Cole for putting your heart into this.
B008BU75IQ|5.0|I loved these chronicles. It just makes me impatient for the next one in the series. These are leaving the reader hanging waiting to see what happens next.
B00C8YOIR2|5.0|'Dead Medium' is a refreshingly new type of ghost story, told from the point of view of a stubborn 75 year old woman that has just discovered that she is dead and can be heard by the living. Peter John is a wonderful writer. Black comedy is a tough genre to pull off and 'Dead Medium' works because the characterizations are so vivid, the situation is original and the writing overall is smart and witty. I recommend this to anyone who likes comedy or is looking for an escapist read or wants to discover a talented new writer.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|I love this game.  great controls and its fast loading and moving.<br />The weapons are right on for the time.
B001GST11O|5.0|Sums up years of Gilmour's perfection. A true 'artist.' Special features include insight to his creativity and genius. Great Collection.
B00CKOYVG8|5.0|Love competing with family and friends...especially with new levels every week...it keeps the game exciting and fun for everyone ...I recommend to everyone
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Loved the first 2 seasons, so glad the 3rd is now available to watch free on Amazon Prime, will zip through them, I'm sure!
B00CV5ZPA2|5.0|This album is a complete game changer.  Just as 808s did, this will shift the sonic direction of music as a whole.  It is in my humble opinion that artists have a responsibility to create thought provoking, and boundary pushing work in order to stay relevant, and help people see that art is still alive and well.  This album proves that Kanye is an unafraid artist without limitations.  There is nothing safe for you here.
B00B2G2RG6|5.0|I did not know if I really wanted to watch this new series so I recorded all the episodes.  Just finished watching them and all I can say is that this series was fantastic.  If you like suspense, action and plot twists/turns, you will love &#34;The Following.&#34;  Every episode was built on the one before it and there were no dull moments.  I recommend this if you are a fan of &#34;Criminal Minds,&#34; &#34;Bones&#34; and other such programs.  I confess, &#34;The Following&#34; had me jumping and screaming at times and I enjoyed every minute of it.
0307271080|5.0|Excellent story. Gripping from the beginning.  A true reveal on the African-America-EU experience.  The characters have a depth often lacking in a love story, which essentially, is what this is.  I would love to see a sequel to this, could also make an excellent film!
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|very cool ifyou like this kind of game. movie was  Soo good just had to buy the game. its good for older children.
B00CWX1HPA|5.0|So Battlestar Galactica 35th Anniv. can be ordered. Why wait I already bought one at Best Buy. It's in 2 stores near me.
0393343405|5.0|Most revealing book I've read in a long time.  If you like your history in story form, this is the right book.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun but a little to easy. Great to pass the time but no real challenge. Good game none the less.
B0053O89JM|5.0|Hated to see the series come to an end but loved each season.  I would recommend the series to anyone who loves Holmes.
B004BEMC6G|5.0|Very good movie. Full of action and drama.<br />If you like Mr. and Mrs Smith you'll like this movie<br />Who doesn't like Angelina Jolie
0761169431|5.0|My grandson already had this book, but that only reveals his interest in such things as folding paper into different shapes.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This app is so addicting, I played it until I ran out of levels!! I want more levels!! hurry please!
B0063GORYU|5.0|Great take on the card game spider, lots of good options for customization. Highly recommended.  And the price is right - it's free
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Song selection was well done, thank you.  The older crowd is able to understand the lyrics which is such a relief.
B003TOMAPC|5.0|A GREAT STORY, GREAT CHARACTERS AS THIS MOVIE GIVES THE VIEWER THE TIME TO GET TO  KNOW THEM AND IT'S A GREAT ACTION FILM, AND YA GOTTA LOVE THE DETERMINATION OF &#34;HIT GIRL&#34; !
B000UVT3OI|5.0|I wasn't all that familiar with Garth's music (except for a few of his huge hits) --- but I loved a few of his songs, so decided to get this CD (Shameless, That Summer, Callin' Baton Rouge).  not only is this a 2-disc CD set, but includes a 3rd disc with over 30 of his videos. I'm enjoying getting to know all his music --- what a pure country voice!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Nice free escape game.  It wasn't particularly challenging, but a pleasant way to spend a free hour. The objects were not difficult to identify, which I appreciated.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|This app allows you to create notes like a journal entry but its safer and easier than writing because you can access it on the ipod computer kindle phone so you'll always have it even if one of those gets damaged it lets you upload audio pictures and videos to save and help create many of your memory's this app is fun and easy to use so if your looking for a nice easy free journal app then stop looking because you have just found the right one I am always looking to find an nonlinear journal like penzu and other apps but this one is by far the best!!!!!
B0030IIZ4M|5.0|I left my 4 year old's DVD case with 16 of his DVDs on an airplane.  I was notified at the connecting gate, but didn't have enough time before the next flight to retrieve them.  I was told not to worry- they would hold them in lost and found an given a number to call.  6 months, 2 dozen left messages later, still no DVDs.<br />I accepted the fact that they were gone.<br /><br />I had purchased a Kindle Fire for my son the following Christmas (after losing the DVDs) and decided to slowly begin to replace the lost movies with versions that included a digital copy.  I was having a hard time searching for that specific category and called customer service for help.  When I explained the situation, the agent not only helped me with my search but reviewed my ordering history with Amazon.  She replaced all of the DVDs that I had ordered through Amazon!  8!  They weren't digital copies - but OH MY Gosh!  How awesome are these guys?!?  I will definitely shop at Amazon the replace the other 8.  Thank you Amazon!
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|I can't wait until the next book comes out! I pre-ordered it and I really am exited! Can't wait! :D
B004ZNB12O|4.0|THE BEST OF PINK FLOYD/A FOOT IN THE DOOR: Any PINK FLOYD fan knows that their complex, sprawling body of work, which includes landmark conceptual albums like DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, WISH YOU WERE HERE and THE WALL, was never meant to be sliced and diced into four minute sound bites. A FOOT IN THE DOOR offers some of their best known radio tracks...HAVE A CIGAR (sung by non-group member ROY HARPER), the sludgy post-ROGER WATERS effort LEARNING TO FLY, and of course, ANOTHER BRICK IN THE WALL and MONEY, the group's lone Top 40 singles. Ultimately doomed original leader SYD BARRET is only featured on the winsome SEE EMILY PLAY, a first peek at FLOYD's quirky, psychedelic art rock, although he's the inspiration for the five part suite SHINE ON YOU CRAZY DIAMOND. The FLOYD's trademark components...DAVID GILMOUR's stunning, liquid guitar blurbs, WATERS' cynical lyrics and edgy, gruff vocals, and RICHARD WRIGHT's spacey keyboard textures...are the main draws on A FOOT IN THE DOOR, which lacks samples from important albums like MEDDLE and ANIMALS. This one's mainly recommended to listeners who aren't adventurous enough to purchase individual platters from the band's vast, ethereal catalogue.<br /><br />RATING: FOUR FLOYDS
B00DF0POXA|2.0|Im a true Kanye fan but I cant get into this whole album. I try to make myself like some of the songs but I cant. I think he invested allot of his time into tracks not really enough into blending tracks and the lyrics.<br />I thinks its really that he calls himself Yeezus. The second coming would produce something a little better than this. He needs a new album title and should have mastered this style of music before making an album
B00CW665VI|3.0|however; I just found the story to be rather blah.  Emma Chase takes a very ordinary story and makes it funny and more intriguing by telling the story from the man's point of veiw.  I had to double check to make sure that it was actually a woman writing the story.  Great technique.  Unfortunately at the end of the story you're left with just an ordinary tale.  I rated it three stars because the story was just that (just okay).  I won't even remember this story a month from now...and with her technique you should re-read her tales.  But Emma did a great job making me laugh with lacking material.  Looking for more from her and hopes she has better stories to tell.
B00785P2QC|5.0|Good game to pass the time.. reminds me of a new aged Sims style. Trucks,buildings,farm's,and removal of landscape is a effects antvenom there hundreds near under different bazooka
B00CEB5QU2|5.0|this is a GREAT device!  but it only works on sd chips and usb drives. doesnt on usb traveling hard drives... still worth buying! great value!
B0087X728K|5.0|Don't really need to review this product as anyone with experience building/repairing computers knows that Arctic Silver is the best.  Helps keep your cpu cool and create a proper thermal bond between the cpu and heatsink.
B0049GYXDG|5.0|Alice in Wonderland is a wonderful Disney classic. I have collected all of them for my grandchildren to watch when they visit.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I have yet to see any of the features for this app that the 4 and 5 star reviews mention.  It stops working as soon as I open it.  I've even tried uninstalling and reinstalling.  I'm glad it was free because if I had to pay for this piece of junk, I'd be extremely upset.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This series has a charm of the English countryside and of the lives of those who live there. The sets, period attire and daily lives of various citizens in these two towns are communicated with charm and authenticity.
B00CV5ZPA2|4.0|After hearing \\"Yeezus\\", I'll give Kanye credit for trying to push rap into a new direction(which is desperately needed). I'm also not surprise by the fan's reaction with their one or two ratings either. This reminds me when fans of Bob Dylan didn't like the change from acoustic folk to electric rock & roll back in 1965 or when Mile Davis flip the script with \\"Bitches Brew\\" bringing the fusion era to jazz. It also reminded me the first time I heard Prince's \\"Lovesexy\\" album back in 1988 or U2's \\"Zooropha\\" back in 1993, after the amazing \\"Sign of The Times\\" or \\"Acthung Baby\\" album, Prince & U2 released an album that didn't make sense at all. That's the way people are feeling about \\"Yeezus\\". Fans are looking at their MP3 Players or tablets thinking 'after the brilliant \\"My Beautiful Dark Twisted Fantasy\\" & the O.K \\"Watch The Throne\\"(the duo album with Jay-Z), he came out with this?' It's like he has so many ideas but instead of making it into one straight flowing song, the same track goes into another beat which doesn't fit at all(\\"I'm In It\\"). I read one Amazon customer review calling it his \\"Kid A\\"(Radiohead). I can see the comparison where an artist have a particular sound then surprise their fans with a new idea & sound.  I called it Kanye's \\"Journey Through The Secret Life Of Plants\\"(Stevie Wonder), \\"Metal Machine Music\\"(Lou Reed) or \\"Zaireeka\\"(Flaming Lips). These artists goes through this period when they released a CD & if the fans don't get it, then that's the listener's problem. To me \\"Yeezus\\" really deserves 3 stars but I'm going to give it 4 stars because I can hear what's he's doing here. Trying to bring rap to a new direction but not focus on making it into a perfect album. But I say this right now, when Jay-Z drop his new album \\"Magna Carta Holy Grail\\" and talk about how great he is, how much money he makes, how much a great business man he is & how he's married to hottest chick in the game and fans call it a great album then it's proves to me that Rap/Hip Hop will go nowhere. So again, I'll give Kanye credit for pushing the envelope with \\"Yeezus\\".
B0071XO8RA|5.0|There are quite a lot of ways he can go with this saga and I'm looking forward to what's in store.
B000V4UFZK|5.0|I bought this because a) I needed to own it and b) I was showing it to a friend who has been very sheltered and never got around to watching even the classic horror movies. Needless to say that it was a hit!
B008K6HN8I|5.0|After a few false starts and glitches, this app is working as advertised. Viewing and utilizing my network is a great convenience.
0307341577|5.0|I read this book before, loaned it out, never received it back, so I ordered another copy to own it.<br />I just liked it that much. Edge of your seat thriller!
B007KOYEOC|5.0|This is a fast paced erotic novel and love story with sexual tension maintained throughout the book.<br />The plot is intriguing with masterful twists, turns and sexual interludes so that it  soon becomes impossible to put the book down. Great read.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|the game is fun and easy to play. at least not too hard for me to finish all levels. highly recommended for leisure playing
B00CISC2DA|4.0|\\"Tomorrow's Harvest\\" is the sound of robots making music.  That is not to say it is the sound of human beings controlling robots to make music; rather, this is the sound of robot's creating music in the absence of humanity.  On a vacated Earth where humans have either gone extinct or left for a different world, many of their machines and computers have been left behind.  In the face of a human void, these devices, over a period of time, start to create.<br /><br />The music of the robots is not a music based upon their gaining of sentience -- it is a simulacrum of sentience based upon their being designed and programed by the humans.  With only the traces of our spirits in their binary understandings and vacuum sealed anatomies, they run like motors compelled only by their existence as physical matter.  Slowly, like erosion carving a canyon, they build up something resembling music yet still very much machine.  Via if/then probabilities and their banks of human data (knowledge) a pseudo-music emerges.  The robots \\"understand\\" only those things that are tangible - rhythm, melody, pitch, tone, placement.  Beauty created is but a coincidence because they possess no true understanding of beauty.  But it is beautiful nonetheless.<br /><br />The striving to create music, i.e., beauty, comes about on this cold and dead earth that humans have left behind out of necessity.  When the masters leave this burnt out husk of a planet there will still be a yearning for those wonderful interpretations of existence of which only human beings are capable.<br /><br />In the past BOC have made a music of electronics creating \\"pure\\" and almost \\"natural\\" sounds without resorting to flat-out imitation.  It was as if a synthesizer was displaying the sound of a blue sky.  Today, on \\"Tomorrow's Harvest\\", the listener hears not a musical interpretation of the natural elements but a reclamation of music in a place where music is no longer heard.
B007ZXK08C|1.0|I can't believe I spent my time reading this book. It is sick, so many stories and she finishes unpunished and no one can prove she is crazy!?
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|I couldn't put this book down!! It wrenched my heart and I felt I was with Cheryl every step of the way. She is a very lovable brave woman.  I will now read  Wild again and I will insist that all my &#34;reading&#34; friends read this book
1451695195|3.0|I enjoyed reading the book and reading about the mans closeness to death.  It shows us that God is with us in all our circumstances.
B006IGZWB2|5.0|This movie was exactly what we needed.  Super easy to rent and watch with Amazon-On-Demand.  Funny and emotional, this movie is sure to please.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|As with Mr. Hosseini's two previous books, the characters become real and I find myself thinking about them throughout the day.  I keep having to reminding  myself that they are in fact characters in a book and that I don't know them personally.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|easy puzzle solving game but still very fun. I like that just when I think I need s cheat I am able to figure outehst I need to do. easy access to pictures much better then other puzzle games I've played!
B00AREIAI8|3.0|I like the subject  of it but it is way too hard to get gems in fact the only real reason I am writing this is so I can get gems.
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|I chose to get this CPU since I built my PC primarily to play games. I'm playing demanding PC games like Crysis 3, Far Cry 3 and the 3570K is more than adequate. It's true when people tell you an i7 isn't necessary for a gaming PC.<br /><br />This is the &#34;K&#34; version of this processor, which means it is unlocked and can easily be overclocked,  I am overclocking mine a modest amount.<br />After running Intel Burn Test (a 3rd party program that stress tests new CPUs)  the processor remains stable and my temperatures are staying cool, reaching a maximum of 65°C. I should note, that I am not using the included CPU cooler, but rather an aftermarket cooler. The Phanteks TC12DX.
B00BYH6MZK|3.0|Great movie to watch once! Mark Wahlberg is a great actor! So is Russel Crowe, but once you've seen this, you've seen this. not really a rewatcher! That's just my opinion, Watch it and have your own! LOL
B007TKT2SK|4.0|Frequently use this at work to show my customers measurements before cutting their lumber or if someone is doing a project and they are confused by a measurement request. Terrific visual aid.
B004SDSSFY|5.0|I was looking for an app that would let me take notes at work, instead of always having a ton of paper notes.  I also didn't want to have to email stuff to myself to get it on my desktop.  Now, with this app, I can take notes on my Kindle Fire HD, and sync to my desktop in seconds!  It saves me SO much time, both at work, and at meetings that are associated with work.  A wonderful value for the investment.  I tried multiple other programs that said they were compatible with Office, and they were just hard to use.  This app is easy to use, and very intuitive.  I highly recommend it!
B005LN5UOC|5.0|my husband will sit and use this headset for hours while playing with his nephew who is across the country and brother in law across the city.  Has perfect clarity and he can speak very quietly and doesn't bother any one else around.
B0085YOD1A|4.0|It't always good to know when you need to plug up, turn off, or charge your kindle. If you don't, you'll be right in the middle of something that is important to you or you may be listening to your favorite music and it's gone in an instant. and you'll want to pinch yourself. This battery pro makes all the difference in the world. It lets you know what to do and when to do it. Some surprises are not all that great.
B00AJER3SE|5.0|Enjoyed watching terminator and  enjoyed just watching again one of my favorites as a child. It has both versions: the old and the new remastered with the added scenes.
0812982622|3.0|First off, I only read this book because it won the Pulitzer Prize.  I have now decided I will read books not because they win literary awards, but because they have public popularity.  I had flash backs of English class when we were supposed to read the \\"great books\\" and how I struggled, I think then it was lack of desire and interest.  I wanted to make this book work and finally \\"got into it\\" after wanting to stop many times.  Sometimes the connection is just not there.  I am sure many people will have major conversations over this book.  I thought the story about North Korea was really sad, and thought the way America was portrayed by the North Koreans was very interesting, just as curious to me was how true the portrayal was of North Korea.  I am now more curious about North Korea and aware than before I read this book, and for that I am grateful.<br /><br />Okay, now on to a book that has popularity votes, I am ready for a page turner and laughter!
B004DLPXAO|3.0|since I have collected e-books since early 1995, I am unhappy with the inability to find and read stories I already own that are on my device.  I can not find a way to make it the default reader.  I also can not find a simple way to quit the program
B007SUW24W|2.0|This CD is definitely written for a younger crowd than mine.  I only liked the one song that is currently popular on the charts.
B00475AYJQ|5.0|The next book is very anticipated in my point of vie  because of how anxious I am to finish such a great series, and with hope the final boom has a great endings  comes out soon.
B00CEMH316|5.0|I've been a fan of Hanson's for years and this new CD that came out today is incredible. There isn't a single bad song on it. More people need to check out this music and catch a show this fall when they are touring. The music speaks for itself. You don't know what you've been missing all these years.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|This program was able to read documents in several formants, on a screen that was 1024X600.  It is also able to read several ebook formats.

B00AO2P3GA|5.0|Modern combat is super An when more are made I will buy<br />When it or so it will be just more better keep making GREAT games
1589795474|5.0|Definitely recommend this for anyone just starting out post College. The book has useful statistics and case studies to support points.
B006OOHYIC|4.0|It gets pretty easy after a few screens, and therefore gets little boring.  It's nice to pass some time while waiting.
0226264211|4.0|Milton Friedman understands capitalism. He is considered to be the top dog in this subject and rightfully so. But, get ready for a heavy read.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I like it. it is fairly good and stuff you know. so yeah like get the game and other stuff.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|I was surprised to read that the producers of this movie did not give it an initial U.S. release, but chose to release it in foreign markets. Apparently they thought that it was too sad to be a hit in the American market. It's a shame that they would take such a short-sighted commercial view of this film, for it offers a powerful  message on the meaning of love and loyalty. An important film, one that will stay with you for a long time.<br /><br />I thought it a nice touch that the producers tied in the original true story that happened in Japan with this American version. That Hachi is sent as a puppy from Japan and is lost at an American train station and found by the Richard Gere  character (or does the dog find him?), a college professor. That one of his friends at his college is a Japanese man who fills him in on the background and character of the breed. I thought one of the most affecting scenes was where this man speaks to Hachi in Japanese at the train station many years later as he still patiently awaits the return of his master and tells him how he understands his loyalty and devotion and respects him for it.<br /><br />I want to add that it's a perfect family movie: no violence, sex, or profanity--just a wonderful tale of love and devotion. There is sadness and loss to it. But sadness and loss are an inevitable part of life, and that is an important message to learn. But the overriding message is one of enduring love, and that is the more important message.
B004LROUNG|5.0|Great read, fast paced and typical Grisham legal book.  I enjoy the legal books he writes versus the &#34;non-legal&#34; ones.  I really enjoyed this book.
B00BESCUKK|1.0|This kills me for I worship QTT and generally his films but this film seems odd from the start.  IDK if there were other things going on but this film doesn't flow, its choppy, and you expect moments of awesomeness that never deliver (like the iron fists).  Somehow Russel Crowe comes off as creepy - but thankfully he isn't in it that much.  The few fight scenes are great but not world class.  Lucy Liu rocks as always but her character pales in comparison to kill bill. I don't recommend renting, purchasing, or sneaking into the drive-inn to watch it.  He eventually had to have one bomb (sorry i enjoyed from dusk till Dawn).
B0060MYM7O|5.0|So I finally decided to watch this series after putting it off for a long time. First season was decent.. I enjoyed it and wasn't bored but I didn't think it was worthy of the hype... Then season 2 came along and things started to get real! I'm absorbed in the story now and can't wait to see where these characters go in season 3!!!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a very fun game. Challenging but not so hard to be frustrating. Cant wait for more levels....eight is not enough :)
B0000VCZKM|5.0|I've bought quite a few movies for my friend, like me her VCR died so now she has to replace all her VHS tapes with DVDs. She's kind of like my mother, had to learn new techs to be able to enjoy her movies.<br />She keeps telling me how much she enjoys watching these movies.
B00CRWJ7VC|5.0|LOVED THIS FILM!!!!!<br />It is so dynamic and there are so many different levels to the characters that you need to watch it more than once - or well I did.  I accidentally followed the actors rather than the birthmark had to stop and restart the film.  I personally believe in the soul's reincarnation and this was a smart fun and interesting way to show it.  It is looong but not painfully loong - you will need to take a break just to take a break.<br /><br />This is my new fav for 2012.
B00AFEY354|3.0|I am watching this and the kids are all really good in their roles, but I don't think the premise of a sensitive, possibly unstable young boy being alternately tormented and being made a pet by kids much older than he, is funny or charming. Patrick and Sam act like they care about Charlie, so they bring him to a party where someone gets him stoned without his knowledge and then let everyone laugh at him. Really caring. There is a world of emotional development between ages 14 and 18, and he is too young to be dragged through adult situations and feelings.<br /><br />I haven't been in high school in many years, but in mine, the freshmen and sophomores, and their lockers and classes were in a different wing than juniors' and seniors' lockers and classes, therefore eliminating the victimization depicted in many stories of high school torment.<br /><br />But I have to say, there is no trace in any way of Hermione in this film. Emma Watson is a treasure, with a fragile strength, similar to Evan Rachel Wood.
B00CHIY5OK|5.0|I promise this will be the most crisp, complete dance album you'll listen to all year. This album likely won't top Daft Punk's latest release in popularity but Disclosure has managed to bring electronic fans the cleanest sounding album of 2013. Get this thing and spin it on a good system and I can guarantee you unfamiliar heads will turn.
B00081U7HC|5.0|I've seen this movie decades ago and never tire of watching it. There were a lot of Actresses in line to play the part but they turned it down because they didn't playing a role of a prostitute. Little did they know this would of put them in line of a Best Actress Award. My favorite scene was when Richard took her shopping because she wasn't treated nice and she went back to the stuck up B*t*hes and rubbed it in, &#34;can't stop now! Must go shopping!&#34;
B00APJLFEG|3.0|I have a 6yr old monster loving niece and this film helped entertain her.  The colors are bright the jokes are slap-sticky and the lead is a female vampire that longs for the adventure of leaving the nest.  My niece laughed, had to show me scenes, and danced with the music.  I would rank this above Ice Age and a hair below Madagascar films.  the ending was happy and if there is a lesson it would be about not assuming or predicting people's reactions.<br />6yr old thumbs up!! I would add this to the collection and pass it on as she ages out of it.
B0066W1AZK|2.0|The options amount to resume.... From pressing the  menu button I suppose and new game. The movement is not as smooth as it should be. Sub part when compared with others available.
B00C7TAF3Y|4.0|I liked the game a lot but it was short. Beat it in a day but still was lots of fun.
B00006DEF9|5.0|I've bought quite a few movies for my friend, like me her VCR died so now she has to replace all her VHS tapes with DVDs. She's kind of like my mother, had to learn new techs to be able to enjoy her movies.<br />She keeps telling me how much she enjoys watching these movies.
B00A9C3RB8|4.0|Loved this!!!<br />Of course with such a great cast how can Hollywood go wrong.  Ya they have in the past but not with this one! This is a sincere look at an aging relationship that has become stale.  Meryl Streep plays a dedicated housewife that is still in love with her husband of 30yrs.  Tommy Lee Jones plays her faithful husband that has shelved his desires and in fact turned them off all together. A muted and perfectly played therapist Steve Carell delves deep and picks at some wounds adding further depth.  You feel for these characters and you are these characters.<br />Worth adding to your collection.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I read a lot of the reviews slamming the author because it became a five part series instead of a trilogy.  Why getting two more books out of the deal is a problem, I don't understand.  The books became more profitable and popular....that's a no brainer!  I found the book entertaining and wow so sexy!  It gave me more of what I wanted and I am so glad I got a Gideon and Eva fix!  I can say that I am ready for the next installment.  The sexual scenes in this book were unrivaled.  I love to get lost in books and stories, and this was a nice escape.  Cut the author and publisher some slack.  It is art but its also business people.  It takes money to produce books and a great deal of work.  If Ms. Day is getting a paycheck for the effort and time she has poured into these characters and feels, as an artist, she can bring the characters through two more books, I am all for it!  Its always better to have more than less!  I was not disappointed in this book and hope others will honestly evaluate the book because it is so easy to get on the negative band wagon!
B00020HEL6|5.0|I really like the CD and was pleasantly surprised at how sweet it was. Thank you so very very much
B0060MYM3S|5.0|She has the First Season and needed the Second. Wal-Mart wanted it for $20.00 more then what I got it for and it was NEW too. I think I did a better deal then what she wanted to do.
B00BCX2F66|5.0|This is the best case I have owned for a phone. It is well made, feels nice in the hand and looks great. It snap's on and off the phone quickly which is important as car and desktop docks don't work with a case on. Other cases I've had for Samsung phones have been a pain to take off with some requiring taking off the back and replacing it. Makes them a pain to use with docks.<br /><br />This case covers the entire phone and protects it when when talking on it so oils from your hair/head don't make a mess the screen.<br /><br />It's easy to keep clean so that dust and crap don't scratch your phone.<br /><br />My only gripes are the one corner comes off too easy by the power button but hadn't caused any issues and snaps back in place without really doing anything.<br /><br />Also would have been nice if HTC incorporated some sort of magnet system between the phone and case like the covers for ipads.<br /><br />Best case I have ever used.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I just wish you got more daily coins, but I guess it's just another way for amazon to get more money out of us.
B0028NSE3M|5.0|I just love this CD. This is one of my favorite CD whereas I like almost every resolve except one.
0783226845|5.0|I've bought quite a few movies for my friend, like me her VCR died so now she has to replace all her VHS tapes with DVDs. She's kind of like my mother, had to learn new techs to be able to enjoy her movies.<br />She keeps telling me how much she enjoys watching these movies.
B00C7DGRL4|3.0|So this is an interesting movie.  Lots of action, blood, and gore.  But the actual idea is completely not believable.  I mean it's like ancient times and they have machine guns.  But I have to admit I enjoyed it.
B005D9MUWY|5.0|I've been using swift key for a couple of years and it has only gotten better. I just updated to the S4 and started using swype and I have to say I'll never go back to typing. It's incredibly fast and accurate and I recommend it to everyone.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|Been a long time fan, and have been waiting for this for what seems like forever, and I am not disappointed.  To finally have all of the original albums, with the original mixes is a dream come true.  To me the sound quality is great, and I consider myself a picky listener.  I am very familiar with the \\"loudness war\\" issue, and brickwalling which plagues so many releases these days, but I personally don't hear it here, I'm not discounting what others have said, but I don't hear any clipping and the music seems to maintain the original dynamic range, at least to my ear.  They may not all be remastered versions, but they all sound pretty darn good, and for $4 a disc how can you go wrong.
B000LTAY1U|4.0|the watch gets 5 stars<br />The amazon description gets 3 because it is incorrect. According to the description, the watch is rated to 30 meters or 90 feet.<br />The back of the watch states &#34;WATER RESISTANT&#34;. According to the Seiko owners manual, this means what it says. You should not shower with this watch or go swimming. It is only resistant to casual water exposure.<br />So Amazon, whats up?
B00CRWJ5GO|3.0|This movie is 3+ hours long so that in and of itself is daunting.  But then there are multiple story lines and it gets a bit confusing.  Visually I liked it but I wish they had of developed the stories and explained better how they connect.
B003B02PEU|5.0|Typical Grisham. Well told engrossing fast moving story. As always the characters come to life and you get pulled into the tale.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Challenging, but not too difficult. Makes you think things through. I would definitely recommend this game to anyone looking for a fun way to kill a little time.
B00A3DZ61W|5.0|I downloaded it to my Velocity Cruz tablet and could not be more happy!  It is a fun and addicting game.  My only problem is my children play more often than I do!
B00CL68NOG|4.0|When this movie came out, I was not that interested in seeing it.  But it was quite good.  I think most people can relate to the fact that the son is trying to get a business started while also worrying about his mother's happiness.  Super cute.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I get this message within one minute of starting the app.  It took me five tries to turn the beta sound off after the app cajoled me into turning it on, because of repeated failures, but it made no difference, the app still failed quickly after startup.  I am using an 8.9&quot;kindle fire HD.<br /><br />Given the unreliability of the app, I can only rate it one star.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really love this game. It really requires your brain to get these cool puzzles. There are no hints for how to escape the house. You only have your head to understand these fun and cool challenges. Highly recommended.
B005CRQ4GU|5.0|I love the diary of a wimpy  they are so funny and after you read the book you can see the movie
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|I love this game I just downloaded it and have been playing it every since I will get tha hang of it soon but I recommend it  2 people 2 play it it's fun really . Just got 2 get tha hang of flying that's all love it Mrs Brooks
B00COGXGNQ|5.0|This was a good movie. Kept me interested till the end. reminded me of sleeping with the emeny. Which is another good movie.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This game is very addicting. Once I start playing time slips away very quickly. I definetely recommend everyone to play.
B003ODIZL6|2.0|Did not have a search button on the kindle fire version so you had to go back and forth to find words
193700788X|4.0|I fell in love with this series and have read them all.  Some of the books have been better than others but I'm very glad I read the series.  In my opinion this book is better than some in the series and not as good as others.  People who are in love with the vampire and/or fairy and/or wolf aspect will be disappointed at the lack of activity (especially the lack of Eric) but this book was more about (necessary) closure and I'm glad I bought it.  I do wish Hunter's character had been developed more.
B0091REZMW|5.0|it was a good hard game. had no problems. couldn't stop playing it.I guarantee. you will love it. hope you have fun.

B002SZAU1Y|5.0|I downloaded a sample and after reading the first chapter and laughing out loud it was a must buy.  This book was funny, sad and so easy to relate to.  I didn't want to put it down, the characters were easy to visualise and you felt like you really got to know them.  It makes you think about what you might do if you were in Holly's shoes and evaluate who your real friends are.  It also makes you think about what you might do if you were in Gerry's position and had to leave behind a loved one.  I will definitely read another book by this author.
0545586178|1.0|I resisted buying into the hype of this series for the longest time until I finally caved and gave it a shot since all the books I want to read are all on waiting lists at the library. I decided to listen to the audiobooks to pass the time.<br /><br />*May or may not contain spoilers* and the Amazon \\"editors\\" are going to edit this post.<br /><br />First Book: Beginning to a little over one third of the book: ZzzzzzzzZZZz... Then, it picks up once they're in the arena. Cool. Action. Action. Action. Someone gets killed. Action. Someone gets killed. Sweet deal. More people die. Good description of grief and mourning, blah blah blah. The end of the game: uh oh rebellion on hand? How exciting! Can't wait til the next book. BUT, what's this? Katniss complains about boys. Katniss whines about boys. Some uninteresting buildup for what's to come in book 2.<br /><br />Second Book: Meandering plot. Nothing happens. More whining about boy #1 and aboyt #2. Can't make up her mind about boy #1 or boy #2. Boring plot. Wait! Is that a sign of great things to come? Nope, sorry, nothing to see here! Moving on. More of nothing happening and it's half way through the book already.<br /><br />Somehow, the author has taken the interesting premise and the suspense of the first book and turned them into a craptastic romance fanfiction the likes of Twilight. What could, perhaps, be one of most interesting heroines for tweens and teens and adults alike has monstrously morphed into a pathetic whiny little brat with not a trace of revolutionary rage and fiery anguish in her. It seems her priorities have drastically shifted as soon as boyfriends enter the picture. Katniss is no longer a symbol of the revolutionary spirit of humanity and instead has become an insufferable stock icon of superficiality, representing the author's own admission of succumbing to peer pressure of trash like Fifty Shades and Twilight tweenie fantasies. So disappointing.<br /><br />I don't care if the action picks up from here on out because there is no longer a heroine worth looking up or relating to. There's just a whiny, bratty little girl who can't seem to decide who, of the neighbor boys, has the most ripped and muscular arms to hold her.<br /><br />Vomit.<br /><br />***Update:  Also, anyone who uses the word \\"literally\\" in a sentence such as this one, \\"I am literally (x number of feet) away from (object) when....\\" should not be trusted.om here on out because there is no longer a heroine worth looking up or relating to.

B00AIJP9BS|3.0|It looked fun, but I have no recollection of getting or playing this, so I'm sure it couldn't have been that great..
B00CKZX0AA|5.0|The movie may have exceeded my expectations but without a perfect score this movie would not be where it is at. Bravo Hans Zimmer. You have proven once again you know what you are doing. Your score alone got me pumped for the movie. Worth a purchase for sure.

0545586178|3.0|I read the Hunger Games so that I could talk about it with my son and watch the movie with him. I am also an author, so I try to read the really popular books to see what people are reading. The premise for the book seemed okay. It's not the first dystopian society book ever written, but it has a huge following so figured it had to be good. It was good, part of it anyway. Katniss has the potential to be a great female character, the premise of the book, fighting each other so as to not starve to death, oppression, the gap between the haves and the have-nots, all good stuff. I just wish the author had been a little bit bolder, a little bit edgier.  It's a story where a small segment of the polulation treats the rest of the world as sub-humans, starving them into submission and using them for their own warped pleasure. Kids murder each other. The author needs to commit all the way, to the horrific violence, not shy away and try to keep it PG just for sales. Some of the parts that confused me were, why does Katniss feel bad that Rue is killed, yet nothing for the boy she kills with the arrow?  Rue, despite their alliance would have eventually tried to kill her. Why can't doesn't she put flowers on the boy who killed Rue, too?<br />I was bitterly disappointed that Katniss did not fight off Clove herself, but is instead rescued by Thresh. Boo!  Let Katniss be a bad ass, and using her wits, fight off and kill a stronger opponent. Can we ever get passed the male rescuing the female?  Why would Thresh give her a pass, knowing he'll have to kill her eventually anyway? That was a glaring weakness in the story. Aaaarg! I really wish I could re-write that part of the book.<br />The part that I really hated was the weird Muttation creatures. First, let's backtrack.  The Capitol has all this advanced technology, hover crafts, medicine that cures practically overnight, can build the arenas to control the temperature, the water, etc, yet they rely on coal for fuel from the mines in the Seam? Huh? I would think they would be advanced enough to develop solar and wind power and not be using fossil fuels anymore. They have an orchard district (Rue and Thresh are from there)? Wouldn't they be growing everything they need in hydroponic towers right in the Capitol? So how are we to believe that they are so advanced that they can inject human DNA and intelligence in huge wolf-like creatures? They can make them overnight? That was sooooo far fetched that I was dying to re-write that part.  Why not just set real wolves on them and in a fight on top of the Cornacopia Cato falls and is eaten alive. Or better yet, Katniss and Cato face off and she wins through strength and cunning and the newly developed willingness to ruthlessly kill her opponent. Only it's not newly developed. Remember the kid she dropped with an arrow? Who was the content editor for this book? They really should be fired, or demoted back to picture books. Katniss had no problem shooting an arrow into the boy who killed Rue, so why does the author make Cato a \\"mercy killing.\\" We've already seen Katniss can drop somebody without a thought. She did it to avenge Rue's death and she'd do it again to save Peeta and her own ass, right?<br />I have committed to reading the series and watching all the movies with my son. I am really hoping that the next book drops the YA namby pamby stuff and makes Katniss the lean mean, I-take-care-of-my-own, killing machine, she needs to be.<br />Just a thought for the poor district people... Um, why not rip up the train tracks and blow the tunnel, sealing the Capitol off from supplies. 'Cause they'll bomb you? Not for long without food and fuel, which they can't get because you have it all.  Well, off to read Catching Fire!the Seam? Huh?

0762777931|4.0|Crazy Sexy Diet has a lot of helpful information for anyone who wants to clean up their diet and get healthier. There are chapters that would really only be new information to a beginner (like the section on eating animal products), but the book assumes you're starting from a point of eating a standard American diet, so it needs to include beginner information for those who are just beginning this journey.  There are also chapters on topics that are more intermediate or advanced (which is about where I am) that were extremely helpful.<br /><br />I do find the writing style very distracting. There's nothing wrong with writing in a casual, conversational tone to make a book accessible to a lot of people, but the writing style of this book is so casual, and sometimes juvenile, it undermines the authority of the author and makes it hard to take what she's saying seriously.<br /><br />For a lot of people, you'll have to get past the writing style of the book to take in the helpful information. But the information is helpful and well worth reading the book.
B002UXRGLG|5.0|The BBC have created yet another selection of incredible footage with interesting commentary. It is undeniably evolutionist in its perspective, but that is to be expected. The 'making of' sections are well worth a look to learn about the sheer effort involved in filming and researching each episode.
B00AQ71FLK|3.0|My grandson down loaded this game and says \\"it's just okay\\". He only plays it about once a week out of boredom, because it does not really challenge his gifted intellect.
B00DGN51O8|4.0|Watched this movie with the whole family.  We thought it was nicely done and that the animation was great!  Lots of fun!
B00BESM14U|4.0|I haven't read the book, but my girlfriend has, and we both ended up liking the movie.  It's a fun, cute teen love popcorn flick.  The plot frankly doesn't have a lot of drama; there's only a couple minutes where you feel that the lead is in danger of losing his friends, and it's all quickly resolved.  The movie hints at deeper emotional issues, and touches on very serious issues, but doesn't explore them with a great amount of emotional depth - they're treated more as a plot device than an in-depth study.<br /><br />I can't decide if that's to the movie's detriment or not, but the movie was certainly a worthwhile way to spend a Sunday night in.
B000HIVIOW|4.0|This is a classic to anyone of the 70's-80's generation. The animation is beautiful, and my children are spellbound when they watch it. This edition is somewhat marred by an annoying introduction by the very glum-sounding author of the book.

B005LAIHYU|5.0|This movie was better than I expected! I love fantasy revisions of historical events and this movie wove real events with vampires as if such a thing really happened! Benjamin Walker was great as Abe Lincoln and he had great chemistry with Mary Elizabeth Winstead as his wife. The head vampire was not over acted, he played his part with subdued menace. I've already viewed this multiple times and enjoyed every time as if it were the first.

1742200508|3.0|My first thought after flipping through this guidebook was that apparently not even Lonely Planet can find information on making a trip to England more affordable. It's an expensive place, I get that, but at the same time I felt like too much of this guidebook focused on fancy hotels and restaurants (as in, diamond-studded and Michelin-starred) rather than giving suggestions for places to stay and eat that wouldn't cost an arm and a leg.<br /><br />Just to get the 'cons' out of the way, another issue with this particular guidebook is the index. Basically, they were a bit stingy in picking and choosing what subjects/places/etc. would both be in the guidebook and listed in the index as well. On top of that, as some other reviewers have mentioned, there's a severe lack of pictures. I've used LP guidebooks before and have noted this about several of them, though, so it's something I've come to expect from their guidebooks...just figured I'd be another reviewer to note the lack of pictures in case someone considering this guidebook feels that a lot of pictures is necessary.<br /><br />On the other hand, they did cram a lot of information about traveling to England in this book, and most of it is detailed enough and fairly reliable that if you didn't want to have to buy (or lug around) several guidebooks for a trip to England, this one would do the trick. Hence my rating of \\"it's okay\\" - I think this guidebook would work just fine for some people, even if it's not particularly what *I* would want out of a guidebook.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This app is fun. Great for children. I would love to see some of the main characters a little cheaper but other than that great.

B003VANOFY|4.0|I purchased this headset as a gift for my son and they stopped working within 6 months. Initially, I was not concerned. Defects can happen, that's why there are warranties. Unfortunately, Logitech will go above and beyond to find a reason to nullify the warranty. After several back and forth discussions, it became apparent that we did not cause the defect. When they could not blame us, Logitech changed their story and blamed Amazon. Although the headset was purchased directly from Amazon (no secondary seller) Logitech claimed that there was a \\"hidden\\" resale and refused to repair or replace the headset.<br /><br />It was a lie. There was no secondary seller but we couldn't force Logitech to make good on their warranty.<br /><br />Thankfully, Amazon customer service helped us and the situation was eventually corrected--no thanks to Logitech. Customer service at Logitech was nothing short of hostile and it was clear from the first phone call that they had no intention of honoring their own warranty.<br /><br />So, while it's a very nice headset (when it works), just be aware that Amazon's warranty is only 30 days and after that, you're on your own. Logitech will not support their products.

B0021L8V1Q|5.0|great dvd
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I love the journey Ana & Christian take together through this series.  Each wanting to take care of th e other, learning about one another, and finding the ultimate love.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I couldn't stop playing. Very creative idea for a game. There are only 8 levels right now which is very frustrating now that I'm hooked.
B004G6TD8Y|4.0|This takes me way back to when I had a few more brain cells to spare, but I lost them with this!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great calculator for what I need. I never have problems with function . It processes quickly and responds exactly as I intended every time!
B00BHHIWQO|3.0|A little repetitious, but enjoyable. I find that I get frustrated trying to beat the clock and can't always seem to do as well as I would like. Fun app!
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This is book that is very hard to put down.  The characters are strong and ring true.  One cares about what is happening to them as the mystery keeps unfolding; one tantalizing glimpse at a time.  The flipping back and forth through time is a bit difficult at first, but by the middle of the novel, one can't help but feel that each chapter is exactly where it should be.  I kept cast of characters list for a bit.  The story kept playing in my head for many days after finishing the book.  This is the first time I have read Kate Morton and it won't be the last.
B004G6TD66|5.0|A must in any true retro rock collection. I was busy play'in Dealer McDope and tripp'in to this long into thew night back in the day.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|LOVED this movie! would gladly recommend to anyone who loves zombie flicks, it tells the story from the zombies point of view
B0064TVQ5E|4.0|I LOVE Mahjong...tried a few other apps for Kindle before coming upon this one. Every puzzle is different and a little more challenging. Nifty music to accompany your game, just be careful not to nod off! (it's very soothing music)
3864070570|5.0|This is just an awesome book. I have many Schlegelmilch photo books but this one uses many photos I have not seen and is just very well put together and layed out. Must have for all fans of European racing.
B003VANOFY|5.0|I love this headset, the 7.1 was not a big deal to me but the wireless is fantastic.  I had the turtle beach x12 headset prior to this one and I love those for a wired headset.  I think the only advantage the x12s had was the feedback so you could hear yourself talk.  I really like that feature, it prevented me from yelling because I couldn't hear myself.  overall one of the best built, best sounding headsets I have used.  I paid $85 for these which was a fantastic price
B0001MLMKY|5.0|love the watch and the Swatch quality.  I am able to tell which day of the week it is and ideal for wearing every day!
B000BYCAJE|5.0|I finally realized that, as often as I hear and enjoy the songs on this album day-to-day, it was strange that I didn't own it.
B00CEMH316|5.0|Anthem is by far the best hanson album yet!! There is not a single song I would skip on this record. I have listened to it on repeat since I got it. The lyrics are filled with heart and soul! This is what real music is all about! It is uplifting, inspirational, and genuine! If you get any album this year, purchase anthem.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I could not put it down! I totally. recommend. this app! Makes you have to think where to look next then figure. out the puzzle.
B005HSG3TC|5.0|This is the second case I've bought for my kindles , I've tried other cases and they are just not as good as this one.  It's lightweight, has a stand and when I'm reading in bed I can use the stand in the verticle position to help hold the kindle comfortably.  I would buy this item again and again.  I have two kindles and both have this case and both have held up very well.
B008RJ6TTC|4.0|Being a murder mystery who dunit fan,  I grew up with lots of different combinations of characters shows. I saw a few of the Columbo episodes and liked a little bit of them.  I decided to give him a real chance.<br />They are well written and Peter Falk makes the character lovable.  Some of the prints of the show are bad. The producers should have digitally restored them the best they could.<br />I haven't gotten into the later years of the mysteries yet, but Columbo has been pretty consistent through the first five seasons.<br />I think most people who like a good mystery will enjoy these.
B007R21JJK|5.0|No complaints. This board has done everything I could ask from it. Plenty of RAM slots. More than enough USB 3.0 and SATA ports.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|Enjoyed this a lot. Took a couple of hours, but well worth it. I am looking forward to more games from this group.
B0000AUHQT|4.0|I enjoyed the movie.  I saw the new Great Gatsby earlier and I think in this version you can understand the story much better.  I would recommend this version to others.
B005K0HDGE|2.0|We tried to listen to this on a road trip with our two year old, but had to stop due to constant f-bombs that really aren't essential to the story or characters. I realize this may not bother most people, but I don't like it. Too bad, because it's a really interesting book, and we might have bought more of his books.
B0093H8H8I|5.0|Super fast processor for the money. I would highly recommend it to anyone. I work on a computer all day long and I've never been bogged down since I built this machine.
B00AFPTSI0|5.0|This is a well researched book that weaves real life stories and experiences with theory to explain the concepts of takers, matchers and givers. Giving is the secret to success, but all givers are not successful.  The secret to successful giving is to do it in a way that helps you and the other party.  Selfless givers often turn into doormats and are pushed around by people for their own good.<br /><br />The concepts presented provide an effective methodology to evaluate one's style and discover faults that are keeping one from being successful at work and in life.  The books provides several ways one can improve and become more successful.<br /><br />Great work Prof. Grant.<br /><br />Wick.
B00A757EFW|4.0|The game is fun, it reminded me of playing it in the arcades when I was younger.  Still hate it when the ghost catches you right on the dot that would make you able to eat them.  But a nice flash from the past.
B00BAYLS1K|5.0|Happy to see &#34;Strictly Ballroom&#34; make it to Blu-ray. Special features not available on my DVD version. I recommend this for anyone who has enjoyed this movie!

B005KELW26|5.0|They will really like it.  I actually bought 2.  One for my regular kindle and one for my kindle fire.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|I like it, now that I can shoot the birds the right way.  The game can be adictive once you get going.
B0091REZMW|3.0|the graphics r great and the sound is too. but I played something like this before and it was a total gag.  played for about 15 minutes before I couldn't play anymore because energy was gone and I needed to BUY more and I wasn't willing too. hope this is better.

B002WIDRM6|5.0|What a great CD.  Great soft country music.  Beautiful voices and great harmonizing vocals.  These guys are the greatest trio around.
B00CH87HF4|5.0|This game is on  of a kind. Full of action, adventure, MONEY, and that old fashion kingdom fighting that everyone loves (not really) But it really is a good game. Give<br />it a try.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|Got it as a free app of the day. It works great on my kindle fire hd 8.9. I like how it tells me how much time is left in my battery before I need to charge it again, on the pull down screen.
B009NQXXZ6|5.0|one of my all time fav's! everything was great as before but better on blu ray!!!! its the best ever!
B004SVM7BW|3.0|I was looking for a PDF annotator for Android that is as good as Goodreader for iPad, because I want to take advantage of an active digital pen in something like the Note 10.1.  This program seems quite good, but is lacking an important feature for navigating easily within a long document.  For working with PDF files that have different pagination sections -- e.g., i, ii, ...{n} for an introductory section, and 1 - 1000 for the main section -- Acrobat (and others) allow the user to assign page numbers within the PDF document that correspond to the published pagination.  Goodreader recognizes the assignment of these page numbers, so that if I want to go to p. ix in the introduction, I can simply by typing \\"ix\\" in the navigation box; or if I want to go to p. 556 in the main part of the document, I can type \\"556.\\"  This program seems not to recognize these pagination designations made in Acrobat, and treats p. i as p. 1, etc.  If I want to go to p. 556 in the text, I have to add the number of pages i ...{n} in the introductory section, and type that number in the navigation pane.  I hope this feature, one that Goodreader has, can be added to this app soon.
B00785P2QC|5.0|It's a very fun game and it's pretty addictive. I would recommend<br /> it to anyone who is bored with their old games.

B0063IH60K|5.0|This game is the best solitaire game for the Kindle Fire I have seen so far.<br /><br />Great graphics and sustained speed.
B00BC24NT4|4.0|I've loved every LeCarre novel I've read, since &#34;spy who came in from the cold&#34;.  The plotting and narrative of this effort is at the skill level I've come to expect of his writing.  The characters, sad to say, are not up to his previous standards, lacking depth and believable motivation.  Worth reading, but not memorable.
B008JFUPK8|4.0|This is a theatrical review of \\"Man of Steel\\" and may contain spoilers.<br /><br />Like Spider-Man and Batman, Superman gets a reboot as director Zack Snyder, with a big assist from producer Christopher Nolan, conjure a darker setting for the Krypton immigrant.  The film opens on the doomed planet Krypton where Jor-El (Russell Crowe) and Lara Lor-Van (Ayelet Zurer) have borne a child, conceived the old fashion way which is illegal based on  the government's genetically manipulative mandate.  Consistent with Superman lore, the planet will soon self-destruct mostly due poor management by the government.<br /><br />In actuality both Jor-El and Gen. Zod (Michael Shannon) have beefs with the government, but Zod acts on his own authority which gets him sentenced to a lifetime of floating in space.  Jor-El and Lara manage to send baby Kal-El into the void destined for Earth along with some magical codex which will allow Jor-El to materialize later and provide fatherly advice.  I was quite impressed with this original act.  The artwork is excellent and there is a nice mixture of advanced science mixed in with rides on flying dragon-like creatures.<br /><br />As the scene changes quickly to Clark Kent working on a fishing boat then a young Clark having to \\"save\\" a school bus that plunges into a lake, I'm wondering where all those earlier years went.  We do get to fill in the gaps as the film occasionally goes into flashback.  What makes this second act compelling is that we understand Clark/Kal-El's dilemma.  His adoptive parents, Jonathan and Martha Kent (nicely played by Kevin Costner and Diane Lane), believe Clark (a bulked up Henry Cavill) should keep his super powers a secret.  They are rightly concerned that this \\"difference\\" will ultimately be detrimental to his growth.  Mankind has a history of not always accepting others who may be different.<br /><br />Clark eventually leaves Kansas searching for the right answers.  This leads him to the Arctic where he finds his biological father in the form of a codex hologram.  Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton.  Lois Lane (Amy Adams) has entered the picture by now.  She's a prize winning reporter who is searching for the mysterious man who has saved many lives.<br /><br />\\"Man of Steel\\" does depart from familiar legend in several ways.  First, Superman is only spoken once that I recall.  The \\"S\\" on the eventual suit is a Krypton symbol, not an \\"S.\\"  While Superman can indeed be weakened, it isn't by some glowing green rock.  Most interesting of all is that, there are few secrets between Clark and Lois.  We don't have to ask ourselves why Lois doesn't recognize that \\"Sup\\" is Clark with horned-rimmed glasses.<br /><br />So where does this movie begin to falter.  In the final act, as Superman must deal with Zod who was freed when Krypton exploded.  Zod, and his hot lieutenant and man hater Faora-Ul (Antje Traue), want the illegally conceived Kal-El destroyed and wants to take over Earth for his own species.  The movie goes into full out \\"Transformer\\"-styled destructive mode.  While some will feel this adrenaline rush is needed after the cerebral middle section, I found it tedious, loud and frankly, pretty boring.  We've all seen it before in \\"Thor,\\" \\"The Avengers\\" and many other movies.  It goes on forever.  It's as if the producers said, \\"Hey, we've still got some budget left, let's get the computerized wreckage in high gear.\\"  Those looking for romance and humor will find little of it here.  I suspect we may see more of that in the next episode.  A final note.  I saw this movie on a big screen (not IMAX) and in 3-D.  I found the 3-D to be very good if conservative.  That's the way I like it.iological father in the form of a codex hologram.  Jor-El suggests that Clark was sent to Earth to improve human existence where they failed on Krypton.

B00992CF6W|5.0|Awesome!!! You really have to get it, it should be 1,000,000 dollars on survival mode there are scary monsters when I was playing the game I was really scared because I thought the monsters were going to get me. Not kidding I was actually scared!!!!
B004J4WKUQ|1.0|I really wanted to read this book because of the insane amount of positive reviews, and I checked out the audiobook the second it was available from my library.<br />This unfortunately was one of the worst books I have read. I was listening to the audiobook, and I got to the fourth CD before I finally was tapped out.<br />I am a child of the 80s, and the references to some of the things from my childhood were nostalgic, but they really began to grate on my nerves after a while. Yeah, I get it, I am old now since all of this stuff happened 30+ years ago, but at least make it interesting to those who lived through it and those who haven't. In addition to that, don't make it like every other phrase was inserted some lame 80s reference that did not tie into the story at all.<br />Also, I felt like the protagonist was just a lame copy of the protagonist from Snow Crash. The protagonist in Snow Crash at least had depth instead of this guy who's like,&#34; Yeah, I know everything about the 80's so any challenge thrown my way is a no-brainer.&#34; The virtual world also didn't have any serious consequences other than you either start over if your avatar dies. Lame.<br />I would give this 0 stars if I could. I think my time would have been better spent playing the ET game for Atari for some lame 80s nostalgia.
B0094BB4TW|5.0|This Facebook app helps me by making it easier to log in, and look at your status updates in no time. But if you forget your password, it is very hard to find out what it is on the kindle. If you go on a computer it is MUCH easier. I really reccomend this app though.

B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|As the series continues, the writers seem to have no issue in keeping our interests high.  With the multiple sub-plots beginning to really develop there's a little something for everyone's taste.  As always, the main plot focus is on the overall survival and success of Dowton; but as we continue to experience more and more of individual character stories the show really comes alive!
B009NY43NY|4.0|A good ending to the series. Ties up everyone's lives quite well. I do wonder what mr. Northman would think of the whole ending :)
B00BUAEYVK|5.0|I have all the Die Hard movies and enjoy them very much. If you want excitement this is for you.
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|fun  and multiplayer is amazing unless you have a small i touch because it will be hard to fit two fingers on there
B005K0HDGE|5.0|11-22-63 is about a person that is able to time travel back in time to change the course of history via not having Lee Harvey Oswalt kill President Jack Kennedy.  Because I am older it was great fun to read about the things that happened in 1960, the way people thought and what things cost back then.  Stephen King did an excellent job on writing about that time period.  The story is also a love story about the main character that meets a woman he falls in love with.  It's not mushy it's very well done and very compelling even for guys.  I couldn't put the book down as I wanted to see what was going to happen next as it is a thriller.<br />Mike M.

B0076DCT2G|5.0|The Panther by John Corey was a spy thriller that was a fun read and interesting.  It taught me a lot about the middle East I didn't know.  It also taught me about the CIA that I didn't know.  Interesting characters.<br />Mike M.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|Jameson Rook gets back with Nikki Heat's squad. He is in the thick of it, helpful and full of delightfully clever observations. Nikki is ever the working detective who is torn between her job and Rook and whether she likes Rook's help or not he does help. I am really enjoying the book.

B006LSZECO|5.0|I had read the first half and was ready to stop reading.  I read the start of the second half and from then on I couldn't put the book down.  If you like a fiction thriller, this is a good one.<br />Mike M.
0449000729|5.0|This book is so easy to read and so interesting. It follows the history of five families over the centuries in what becomes today's England. Although it is fiction, it all seems so real. The author has done magnificent research. I first read it several years ago, and wanted to replace a copy I had, because it is one of my favorite stories.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|Admittedly, I read several negative reviews and decided I probably would not complete the series. I judged this book by the reviews, not the cover. Curiosity nearly killed me so I downloaded the sample.  Then I decided to read it and judge for myself.  What I found was more intimate details of Gideon and Eva's relationship and personal lives.  I read reviews where some said all these \\"filler details\\" were unnecessary to the story. I disagree. We all complain that we want more when we finish a book.  We long to see how their character's lives play out, we want to be with them in their day to day routines.  That's what Sylvia gave us.  She gave a chance for us to get to know how she envisions Gideon and Eva at their highs and lows.  This book still conatined suspense and drama. I do agree with the majority on the ending.  Where's the cliffhanger Sylvia???  You left me without a hunger for the fourth book.  That was not an book ending to me, much less a chapter ending.  I do want to see how their story plays out, so I will purchase the next book.  For all the negative reviewers, if you don't write then don't judge.  I'm sure Sylvia's intent is to give her fans what they want, they want more Gideon and Eva and she's working on that. You can't please all of the people all of the time.
0385366752|1.0|I listened to this on DVD. First, let me say the voice of Nick drove me CRAZY especially when he was doing everyone else's voices! I was so bored almost throughout the whole book up until at least one surprise actually came. I felt tortured by not only Nick's speaking of other character's voices but also waiting for something to actually happen that interested me. I don't think it ever came. I am now on the last CD and just pushing through it to the end. The surprises to me were minimal. In fact, I kept expecting something exciting to happen, perhaps how I would write it to make it that way, but that never happened. I really didn't find anything surprising except one part. I was severely disappointed in this story and can't wait til the end. No matter how it ends I am sure I will just be happy it's over. Maybe others think it's great but I surely don't understand what they found in it that was so thrilling. Also, both Nick and Amy were totally dislikeable characters. There was no one to root for!

B003O86FMW|5.0|Most often, a sequel doesn't have the power to excite the way the first in the series does.  Catching Fire does deliver the riveting grip that makes me turn page after page.

B00947N6D8|5.0|Great movie to share with the family and to remember your own childhood memories .. always a good thing have something to believe in
B008OM0EDO|4.0|Just like Borat and Bruno, the movie is side-splitting hilarious.  I was rolling on the floor laughing (ROFL).  However, movie extremely politically incorrect, completely insensitive, and just plain horrible.
1490313370|5.0|I have followed James Altucher for over 15 years, he has been up,down and shaken around and you may not agree with everything but he tells you straight and talks from the heart.<br /><br />Today we see an influx of business and lifestyle gurus that tell you \\"how to solve your problems and get rich\\" but when I have talked to them they crumble and start quoting other peoples work or experiences. Like myself James has suffered great set backs and success and talks from actual experience without preaching. When you read a book and it says \\"When I, I found that, in my XYZ business\\" then you know they are the real deal.<br /><br />If you can just learn one thing from this book and I am sure you will learn many you have covered the few dollars it costs.<br /><br />I am looking forward to interviewing James next week and will post it up on The Millionaire Dropout site [[ASIN:1118609484 The Millionaire Dropout: Fire Your Boss.

B00005R24K|2.0|This film is suggested as being one to 'scare the living daylights out of the viewer' (my words).<br />Originally this film MAY have been of the super scary genre. I found the film to be VERY tame, amateurish and suitable for the dust bin. The cast would appear to have been brought in from a local amateur group, with the characters standing around waiting to say their lines. The 'horror' make-up is just that, horrible. I guess that the director Sam Raimi had to start somewhere and this film appears to  be right up there at the starting line. I found myself thinking that enough was enough, and the temptation to stop watching the movie becoming 'possessive' as the minutes ticked by. I've since watched EVIL DEAD 2 and can only say that this sequel was much in the vein of its' predecessor. I couldn't recommend The Evil Dead. In a nutshell...horrible.

B000JLPMPS|5.0|Unforgiven works so well because it is a convincing attempt at painting a realistic image of what it must have really been like to be a cowboy. Unlike westerns of the past where our heroes kill 20 dozen men and feel nothing, Unforgiven paints us a very different picture about the price you pay in your own soul for taking another man's life. Clint Eastwood struck gold with Unforgiven. The timing couldn't have been better in 1992 for a full scale engrossing western, and in the end Eastwood finally had his Oscars he had been dreaming about, even if he lost the nod for best actor. I am sure he wasn't too disappointed. Several actors here give possibly the best performances of their careers, and Gene Hackman won an Oscar for his portrait of the brutal town sheriff 'Little Bill Dagget'. This movie holds it's own along with classics like Dances with Wolves and The Wild Bunch. Maybe not as sweepingly epic as those films but just as good.

B00BTHWFBK|2.0|It is definitely Black Sabbath. The sound is them, but nothing memorable. Would not recommend this one as a must have.
B001OGWY1W|2.0|Masterpiece?!! I've seen some reviews out there calling this movie one. Say what? What is happening with the world and it's understanding of what makes a great film or a classic? The past few years have given the world a whole slew of highly praised films that are pretty much just good but not great. All the buzz got me really excited, but this film hardly resembles the dramatic praise everyone has been chanting about it.<br /><br />The script is at times downright stupid, predictable, and inept. Christian Bale is not the worst Batman eve, but runs a close second, and his Batman alter ego voice is so bad I found my self laughing hysterically at how bad it was. Gary Oldman, a wonderful actor, is lovable but miscast as Gordon in my opinion. Heath Ledger(R.I.P)is brilliant but not anywhere as interesting as Nicholson's rendering of the character. Ledger's performance was good but nothing to blab about really. But Nicholson's Joker was wonderful.<br /><br />And finally, the stellar talent of great actors like Michael Caine and Morgan Freeman are wasted here in this critically overblown outing of the Batman saga. One only needs to refer back to Tim Burton's two classic Batman films to understand why I didn't care for this attempt so much. Both of Burton's Batman films were full of movie magic, memorable action, well cast actors, twists and turns at every corner, and lots and lots of some of the finest film making ever done for a comic book to screen movie. Some actors here were so wooden I could barely stand it.<br /><br />I absolutely cannot believe how many people have called this film \\"The greatest film of the year\\", \\"The best movie I have ever seen\\", \\"A masterpiece\\". I don't think it's one of the worst movies ever, it's not that bad, but putting this movie in the hall of fame reserved for classics and calling it \\"The greatest movie I have ever seen\\" is way, way, way over the top. What has the public been smoking lately to speak so highly of just a simply good action movie? C'mon people!movie? C'mon people!

B009XIXVU6|1.0|Yet another e-book with offensive publisher pricing.  On what planet does it make sense that a heavy hardcover book costs LESS than an e-book with near-zero delivery costs?  I realise this is not Amazon's fault and is out of their control but the publisher should know that the net result of their anti-competitive agency-model publisher mandated pricing is that I will not be PAYING for this book.<br /><br />I really liked the previous books in this series so this is quite disappointing.
0812993845|1.0|I love Sophie Kinsella.  I always look forward to her next releases (which seem to be few and far between).  However, Wedding Night is quite possibly the worst book she's ever written.  The plot is dumb and the characters are just shallow.  I thought Undomestic Goddess was ridiculous but this one takes the cake.<br /><br />Sophie, please tell me there's another Shopaholic book coming out -- Becky is going to Hollywood after all!
B00DF0POXA|4.0|Kanye West on his instincts:\\"It's only led me to complete awesomeness at all times. It's only led me to awesome truth and awesomeness. Beauty, truth, awesomeness. That's all it is.\\" (Source:http://www.usmagazine.com)<br /><br />Kanye's latest affort is the soundtrack to the perfect marriage between Hip Hop & Electronica (which I applaud since it sounds opposite to what is considered \\"radio freindly\\"). His lyrics are deep and on point (as usual) but if you are looking for the fomula from his first three albums you  w i l l be dissapointed. From the first track \\"On Sight\\" it is evident that Mr. West's hunger for achieving greatness has led him to venture into more electronic beats and sounds leaving behing the samples and more traditional sounds for this genre. The last of the experimental portion of the album is track 5 \\"Hold My Liquor\\"in which he raps over a more ambient beats. From track six till it's ending the tracks are reminiscent of his previous efforts but with a twist.<br /><br />In conclusion; This is a great album but not for everyone. I do think that is ahead of it's time and it will gain more appreciation as the years pass (American Life anyone!?). Perhaps for all those whom do not like the direction of the album with a few spins your opinion might change.
B00D6BQPMM|5.0|This film was my all time favorite during the limited time it was shown in theaters here. I must have gone to see it at least 9 times. The characters are so true to the story that Issac Marion put forth in the original novel that the film is based on. Warm Bodies gives you everything you would want from a film. The horror, suspense, the intense emotional rollercoaster, and the hilarity that you've only seen before in Shaun of the Dead. The actors that portrayed the leading roles are just perfect and spot on for the film. Nicholas Hoult that played \\"R\\" gave him all the heart and soul, that a real zombie may have lacked. While Teresa was able to embody the same kick ass attitude we expect from someone so capable of taking a leading lady role and running it like it should be. She showed in The Sorcerers Apprentice, I Am Number Four, and now Warm Bodies that she can play dual roles as the tough down to business chick as well as the warrior half and then the tentative love interest even when the guy is dead. I'm ashamed to say that while writing this I've unfortunately forgotten the name of the actor that portrays Marcus but his comedic timing is unforgettable. The scene at the airport lounge where they decide to...nope...just check the film out to be sure. Its going to be one of my favorites and will always find a spot on my TO WATCH list of classics in the genre.

0545123275|5.0|The Wolves are calling. The Wolves of Mercy Falls. Everything you know will change...from page one.<br /><br />Shivers ran down my spine as the author's poignant words touched my heart, causing it to melt. I was mesmerized by the fluidity of prose and the descriptive way in which Maggie Stiefvater captures everything; touching all senses. The sounds of the leaves rustling in the gentle, autumn breeze to the colors of Grace's multi-tonal hair; the vivid imagery is simply breathtaking in this book. I was enchanted by Grace and Sam's deep love for each other. I was fascinated by the author's singular interpretation of Werewolves, (like how they `change'/ shift in the winter and are adverse to the cold. How human's get bitten and shift every summer until their days are numbered and they give in to their inner Wolf). This is a deeply complex tale containing powerful, heartrending meaning and multi-layered connotation.<br /><br />\\"I fell for her in summer, my lovely summer girl,<br />...she holds the heat, the breeze of summer in the circle of her hand\\" - Sam's song.<br /><br />This has to be the most unexpected Young Adult story I have ever encountered, with the entire concept of a shapeshifting pack animal being so different. It is the strong (and quite heartrending) connection/ link that the Wolves have with their human form, which is so supremely singular and the main element that makes this book a \\"great\\" one as apposed to just a good read. I find that one's teenage years are filled with music, and so I found the use of music and song lyrics (to express feelings and thought) in this book so brilliant ~ Maggie Stiefvater encapsulates her target readership acutely.<br />I did find it took me a long time to read this book, as the detailed descriptive way in which the author writes takes you longer to form images of events in your mind and comprehensions; but which, I feel adds to the drama and depth. I however, loved the complexity of the history and the entire tale as a whole...many YA stories you find don't quite go into such detail as to paint an intricate picture.<br /><br />The ending was so inwardly touching that It moved me to tears. I had been on such an intense, emotional rollercoaster of a ride and such a profoundly personal journey with the characters that I felt the story having such an effect on me. It is a Romeo & Juliet tale complete with love triangle (Shelby) and full of danger and drama.<br /><br />\\"...She could've looked at the tiny miracles in front of her: my feet, my hands, my fingers, the shape of my shoulders beneath my jacket, my human body, but she only stared at my EYES\\"<br /><br />The thrilling last few pages building up to such an astonishing climax, was the perfect end to their story and the perfect beginning to their journey to come. I am so looking forward to reading Linger and Forever that I cannot wait to pluck them from the shelf. Some stories stay with you forever and this is one of those momentous works which will remain etched within a corner of my heart for all time - it is simply stunning!a whole...many YA stories you find don't quite go into such detail as to paint an intricate picture.<br /><br />The ending was so inwardly touching that It moved me to tears.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Don't read this expecting the movie because they are a bit different, as film representations tend to be. The book is infinitely better. This is a simple, quick read, but has a lot of deeper meanings than you might expect. Great for teens and pre-teens.

B006ZB3V2C|4.0|I got this app from the Play Store a year or so ago, and have used it almost every night since. The ability to mix different loops and sounds to such exact settings was actually fun, and something I hadn't seen in any of the other noise apps I tried. I've recommended the app to a few folks since.<br /><br />Strangely, at time of writing this (June 19 2013) the version here on Amazon is a version behind the one on the Play Store (2.9.1 vs 2.9.4). That one is free, but only comes with the basic sound set, while this has all the paid content. It's also true that an update to a v3 has been promised for some time now, and hasn't shown any movement since this February. I like to believe that is due to a hobby developer, or this being a side project for a developer, but I have no basis for that. Hopefully this finds some success as the Free App of The Day, and kicks the dev back into gear.<br /><br />Having said that, the version here works fine, if a bit slow, but that's probably because I have all the packs installed.<br /><br />5 stars, minus 1 for stalled(?) dev, and being a version behind the Play Store.

B003UBTX6S|3.0|Most of the book was boring.....it kept me busy with stupid details. The reason I gave it as high as a three is because when you made it to the meat of the story it was so much better than the rest of the book it was exciting.  Also the movie for the first book really sucked.  They should not have changed the ending and they should not have deleted characters.  Bad call.

B00CEMH31Q|5.0|This is a really great Hanson album. I'm a little different than the typical Hanson fan. I'm in my late thirties and became a fan because of This Time Around, their second album. I was not a fan during Middle Of Nowhere/mmmbop.<br /><br />This album offers a little bit of everything. There's some rock with 'You Cant Stop Us' and Fired Up, some soul/motown sound with 'I've Got Soul,' 'Get the Girl Back,' and 'Tragic Symphony.'  The album also offers some straight pop and a couple ballads. Isaac also returns with lead vocals in 'For Your Love.' It also features their typical great harmony.<br /><br />1. Fired Up<br /><br />This song is a great rock song and a great way to start the album. I love the guitar in this song and it has great attitude. If you need to psyche yourself up for a game or a job interview this would be a great song to listen to.<br /><br />2. I've Got Soul<br />This song is a more soulful song. Good horns. Also features a guest vocal which is not typical of Hanson songs.<br /><br />3. You Can't Stop Us<br /><br />This is the second straight rock song of the album, featuring Zac and Taylor on lead. It is similar to Fired Up, but offers more powerful harmonies. It reminds me of 'Rest In Peace' by Extreme. Good guitar riffs.<br /><br />4. Get the Girl Back<br />This song is the most like the songs on Shout it Out and is the first single. The album version has a slightly more extended intro that I think adds a lot to the song. It features horns and harmony. It has the most Motown feel. I like the song, but it's not my favorite. There's actually too much cowbell, if that's possible. Catchy tune.<br /><br />5. Juliet<br />This is a Zac lead. I love this song. It's very sweet. It's a slower song but not a ballad. Some lines from 'Romeo and Juliet.' I really like the rhythm of this song. There are some strings in this song and it's piano driven. This is one of the gems of the album. The way he stutters when he says 'Juliet' is cute. I also think this is probably Zac's best vocal performance on an album.<br /><br />6. Already Home<br />The bridge makes this song. It has a huge sound that really makes this song. Great harmonies in this song. Guitar driven with some organ sound. They use a Hammond B3, a Wurlitzer, and a Rhodes piano on the album. I don't know enough to know which one is in this song, but it works well. Great beat and driving rhythm to this song. Maybe the most anthemic song on the record.<br /><br />7. For Your Love<br />This is Isaac's lead. It's a nice ballad. The slowest song of the album. It would make a great wedding song.<br /><br />8. Lost Without You<br />This is a power ballad. I don't like power ballads, but if you like power ballads then you will like this song. Good rhythm and harmonies. It's well done, I just don't like power ballads, so if it were the best power ballad on the planet Still wouldn't like it that much.<br /><br />9. Cut Right Through Me<br />This is a very catchy tune. Great harmony. Great combo of guitar and organ sound.<br /><br />10. Scream and Be Free<br />This is another Zac lead. This is a slower song but not a ballad. I really like it. Good lyrics. This will be a great song live.<br /><br />11. Tragic Symphony<br />This is my favorite song of the album. Great groove and attitude. Sounds more like Michael Jackson than any other song on the record. Also features a violin. I can't capture how good this song is by writing about it. You just have to listen to it.<br /><br />12. Tonight<br />This is a slower song and the longest on the record. It has a great sound, and more knowledgeable Hanson fans will love all of the hidden song references throughout the song. They reference many songs that appear on albums, starting with 'Rain' from Boomerang and even including songs from Fan Club cds. This features lead verses from Taylor and Isaac. Great harmonies in this song as well. A great song to end the album with.<br /><br />13. Save Me From Myself.<br />This is pretty much a bonus song for the Album. It's kind of depressing but still a good song. It features Zac on lead. It reminds me of 'Believe' from Underneath.<br /><br />This is a great album. I think it's their best work since This Time Around. The sound quality is also much better than Shout it Out for you audiophiles out there. There isn't a weak song on the record.

B000LXHK2C|4.0|This purchase was a replacement DVD for one that quit working.  I HAD to replace it because this is a movie that is not only sweet and entertaining, but the cinematography is beautiful.  It got lackluster reviews from critics because everyone views Russell Crowe as a &#34;dramatic&#34; actor, and they failed to see the nuances of this lighter but endearing and romantic performance.  Albert Finney is wonderful, and Marion Cotillard is lovely and so perfect for her role.  I came across this movie totally by accident in a local book store bin for $5, and would replace it even if I had to pay $25!

Jillian gives you a great work out, including a warmup and cool down, inside 30 minutes. There are 3 levels of intensity, and while each workout definitely leaves you feeling like you worked for it, none of the exercises themselves are complex or require skill. Great bang for your buck all the way around
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Normally, I wouldn't have read these books. I'm more of  a romance reader & read Danielle Steele, etc but a lot of women (and some men) were  talking about it, so I thought I'd check it out. I 'm so glad I did!  It introduced me to a  VERY different lifestyle but  it had such a good story and shows that love can conquer all!  My friends & I love the \\"inner goddess\\"!  I'm off to read  \\"Fifty Shades Freed\\"!

B00BR0SGN0|5.0|I have been a Purple fan for over 30 years now, and while I like and respect the Morse era (I consider \\"Sometimes I Feel Like Screaming\\" one of the best songs I've heard) for some reason I never bought one of those CDs. I bought this one on a whim, and I am really surprised. This is a fantastic album. It flows very easily, and while you know the two main soloists of the band on their classic era are gone, you find it has a distinctive Purple sound. My favourite tracks: \\"Weirdistan\\", \\"Bodyline\\", \\"Apres Vous\\" and \\"Vincent Price\\", which I would loved to go on other 3 or 4 minutes. Even my 13 year old daughter asked me to rip it for her iPod. For me is by far the best DP album since Perfect Strangers.
B00C27LB20|5.0|I previewed this young man's record and was blown away by what little I was able to hear so I decided to buy it. Then I found out how young he is. This guy should be around for a while. If you are questioning whether to buy it or not, just do it, you will not be disappointed.

B000FBJF6Y|5.0|I loved this book.  It is the story of a woman detective in Africa.  She is a happy, content, African woman and no one has ever heard of a woman detective in her part of Africa.  It is full of beautiful African scenery descriptions, culture and simple beauty.  Also, she always gets to the heart of the matter.
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Their driving melodies and infectious beats that will make you want to get up and dance in the middle of nowhere; this is a must have album of the decade.  I have to say being a long time fan since 97 I have seen the band evolve from boys to men with mature lyrics since the days of MMMBOP.  Even if your not a fan of Hanson you should own this album its an anthem of life and has a story to each song and I assure you can and will find yourself in each of these songs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Gives your brain a very serious workout!  You must look closely to each and every clue.  Sometimes they are not easy to find.  AWESOME!

1451668945|1.0|\\"He sighed with relief when he turned into his own driveway....\\" Made an asphalt of himself, no doubt.<br /><br />MHC's books continue to be poorly edited, poorly plotted, overly fractured, and filled with a gazillion different (and mostly extraneous) characters. And maybe she was just too sensitive to allow the original rabbit skin, so she felt called upon to rewrite an old nursery rhyme.<br /><br />Sheesh! Why do I bother?
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|It's simply Hanson at their best...thus far! Has elements of the classic \\"Hanson\\" sound, but with a more amped up, rock feel with a bit of MJ-ness. It has a terrific flow and a variety of song styles to appeal to every mood.
B00CB4ET0K|5.0|Frontline Commando: D-Day is a great game with a lot of detail. The only problem is that u have to pay real money for the good guns. I'm sorry, but I'm not going to spend ten dollars on a virtual Thompson machine gun. Other than than that, it's a great game!
1781162646|5.0|I'm a huge Stephen King fan, reading my first book of his five years ago at the age of 13 (it was \\"It\\" and I only understood about half of its 1,000-something pages until I read it two years ago). I fell in love with the way he can convey emotions and make characters so accessible. His writing style just is extremely appealing to me.<br />Anyway, I was extremely excited about this book (particularly because of it's amusement park setting) and got it as soon as I could. However I hadn't read any of his newer works yet and was a little weary about how much I'd enjoy this book. Simply put, I loved it. It conveyed the emotions of your first love and a summer job (I tried my hand at my local amusement park this summer, Kennywood) and had this aura of mystery around it until the very heart-stopping end.<br />Seriously a well-written book that I've added to my small collection of favorites. Definitely worth the money!!! :)
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Fast paced, attention holding, big surprise ending. Didn't see it coming. All the elements I like in a story.  Awesome storyline. Kept me guessing to the end. Can't wait for Wayward Pines (2nd book) to come out in September 2013. Will definitely put this author on my list with King and Koontz.
B008GXHOFW|5.0|I used to have a gamecube, and the same game was on it. But now on my kindle fire, it brings back the memories.....
B00002N9ER|5.0|They fit perfect and holds my light tight in my truck, so i can find it when i need it
B00CH87HF4|5.0|when u play this game you are hooked right away enemies. are always attacking so totally hard but fun if you play for a long time you will get getter. so totally by this app its beastmode and godbless you viewers
B00CWY76CC|3.0|this game is challengingand fun. it really makes you use your brain. it is a lot of finding things and figuring out where it belongs.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love this app it is amazing! More levels please! This app deserves five stars don't miss out on a app like this!
B00BQPEIT2|5.0|Great graphics as well as game play.  It's a really fast paced, fun game that can get intense at times.
B007CKNX28|5.0|All the songs on this album are great. We never have to skip a track. This was my first Jack White cd and now I'm a huge fan
193700788X|1.0|After being an avid fan of the series, I have become increasingly disappointed over the last few books. Unfortunately, I have to say the same thing about True Blood and it kills me because they were both so good in the beginning. I've never gotten the impression before that CH was borrowing from other authors, but Sookies garden in DEA is like a page out of Alice Hoffman's Green Angel and her brief characterizaion of the devil sounds like something Christopher Moore would write. Aside from not being a fan of the plot and resolution to the big Sookie/Eric saga, I was truly disappointed by the overall lack of imagination. Here are just a few things that really bothered me - Sookie asking the reader, \\"Don't you hate it when you can't fit the cardboard disc from your DiGiorno pizza in the trash can\\" and her stream of consciousness during her first sexual encounter with Sam \\"good please again dick long hard\\" Really?? Even Shades of Grey did better than this. Another thing that irritates me is the title - it's like a misleading slap in the face to those readers who anticipated that Sookie would finally become a vampire under some condition that she could accept. My husband doesn't even read the books and he looked at the title and said, \\"So Sookie finally becomes a vampire.\\" One of my hunches is that, although SS predated Twilight and The Vampire Diaries, CH might have been afraid of being categorized as a copycat if she turned Sookie. So what? Why couldn't she have thrown her loyal readers a bone? What a let down.
B004G600A4|5.0|This is one that I don't mind watching over and over again. The horse makes the whole family crack up
B00466HM28|4.0|really portable, great balance of features/function, keys are responsive... couldn't get it to communicate with my pc at first... now works great.
B0085YOD1A|5.0|So far it seems very basic, and does help with keeping a closer eye on the battery. I don't always look onto the corner to see where the battery level is so having this makes it hard to miss.
B00CI5ET7K|4.0|This album will grow on me but it's not as good as &#34;Super Colossal (one of the very best ever!!!)&#34; Musically it is still Joe and he can move through chords like a music genius... perhaps the musician ever in my book!!! I will buy every Joe Satriani album because I would love to play as good as him.
B007HJ84ZK|5.0|I finally broke down and tried out Season One of Game of Thrones and found myself quickly being hooked.  From the very first scene, I was intrigued about what is going on in this world and that only grew as I was introduced to and got to know the characters in this fantasy world.<br /><br />Game of Thrones is set in some archaic world of sword-fighting, knights, and court intrigue...to put it mildly.  Also, on this world, the summers and winters can last for years and there are these scary beings who live beyond a huge wall of ice that is patrolled by the sworn men of the Night Watch.  The world is broken up into Seven Kingdoms, all ruled by a King who took the Iron Throne when the former royal family was driven across the sea (leaving just a sister and brother of that line to try and re-claim the throne).  The King's best friend and supporter is \\"Ned\\" (played wonderfully by Sean Bean, better known from The Lord of the Rings) who lives up north, has a boatload of kids he's trying to raise to be honorable, and tries to steer clear of politics.  To little avail, of course.<br /><br />There are many characters to love and characters to hate.  Just as there are dirty little secrets to be kept, double-crossing of all kinds, and hints of scary stuff to be unleashed once the long winter's night finally falls.  Oh, and hints of dragons once past and perhaps yet to be.<br /><br />Be warned, there are gory bits in this show, nudity, and general nastiness.  But there are also scenes where honor is upheld no matter the cost and where characters come into their own, overcoming huge trials in the process.  There are also plenty of gray characters who you never know whether to trust or not, as well as characters who are just plain crackerjack crazy.  This show will definitely keep you guessing...<br /><br />Perhaps, the biggest issue was in trying to keep all of then straight at first and figuring out who belongs to what house and has what totem (stags, dire wolves, lions, or dragons are the four main ones), but by the third episode or so you will figure it all out.  I could have used a bit less gore in a few scenes, as well...but overall this is a fabulous fantasy series, one well worth hitching a ride on.  Take a chance.  You might just get hooked, too!
1932735410|5.0|Cleared my PMP certification last Sunday and I just used this book for my preparation.Really worth buying this book if you want to understand about each process in detail....
B004EPZ07K|3.0|For years I was looking forward to seeing a Green Lantern movie, however the movie itself .Wasn't as great as the trailer made it looked. Don't get me wrong ,I though that the movie.Was good except for a few things, that they could have done differently. First instead of Hector Hammond and Parallax as the main villains, they should have done Sinestro from the beginning. That could have shown how they met, why Sinestro was kicked out of the Corps,and how he got his yellow power ring and battery.That and the whiny hero thing not cool, HEROES DO NOT WHINE !!! Anyway that and Ryan Reynolds would have made a better Flash , since I originally heard that he would. Be cast for that role but alas, here we are still waiting. For those idiots at Warner Brothers and DC Comics , to do a Flash movie. I guess they're still riding that Batman /Superman dick!!!
B00CW665VI|5.0|Loved this story! It had me laughing and crying! I totally recommend it to anyone who loves a romantic book.
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|It's so funny to me how hard it is for some to see (including ourselves) what a magical universe it is that we live in. Recognizing our own power and how our thoughts, feelings and intents  shape our individual and shared realities is a bit like waking up from a dream that you had little, or no idea that you yourself have been perpetuating. Pam's book is just that little nudge that some of us need in the morning, and oh what a fun, gentle and delightful way to open your eyes!
B000NI8F5G|5.0|See this Gene Kelly and Donald o'Connor film for some great dancing, singing and laughing.  It's worth noting that Kelly choreographed most of the dancing. Additionally, he taught Debbie Reynolds how to dance in preparation of this film.
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|So far so good. Helps me to keep all my important e-documents in one place. Would recommend to everyone I know.
0316286850|4.0|Terrific book and plan to try some of the techniques. He goes step by step to show you how to apply makeup for different styles.<br />He is a great Artist!
B002VHI8FE|5.0|I like book it is his two reed. Dis book make happy me. Now I tell it you good okay
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I really enjoyed this game. I wish there were more levels. Maybe there will be in the future. Until then I will be waiting.
B001IF252M|5.0|Great buy; it works like a charm. And the price is so nice. What a steal! Grab it while you can.
B00CWY76CC|2.0|The game downloaded and installed and then opened fine, but would not do anything after that. Not sure if it's supposed to work on a Kindle Fire, but it does not work on mine.
B002MGGM9I|5.0|I echo most of the sentiments of the other reviewers. I didn't quite enjoy watching it via Amazon Instant Video. I wished they took a cue from youtube and allowed me to buffer the stream at 1080p rather than scaling down the quality to match my connection speed. Maybe the option is there, but for the life of me I couldn't find it.
0425269205|4.0|I gave this as a gift and have only see photos of it, but the recipient is delighted! Many thanks.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|great game!!!! not that hard but keeps you interested. hope they come out with more levels!!!  good for free app. of the day. more levels I might even buy it. smitty mallet dear yin.
B008KHG2K2|5.0|Awesome Superman statue for a reasonable price.  I like how the statue is in a package with a clear front so you can still display it factory sealed.
B00AZMFO6I|5.0|Wonderful actors/actresses and great humor! For anyone not afraid to see the humor in oneself as we age, we recommend this movie. We also love that Dustin Hoffman used famous musicians as part of the cast.
B00004OCQ2|5.0|This disc is pure gold like a buried treasure. Jake's tone is fantastic and the album sounds way better than a thought it would for a demo/rehearsal disc.
0385508417|2.0|While the premise of skipping Christmas is a reasonable one; I found his treatment of the characters to be unkind and not believable.  All of the neighbors treated this man as if he were a kill-joy for not celebrating Christmas as per usual.  The twist at the end while funny really put me over the edge.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I have read the reviews from those that are angry the story is to be continued. I am thrilled the story is not finished yet! And, Chapter 9, OMG!!!<br /><br />I look forward to reading about the real wedding, Eva and Gideon's possible children (and how they will fiercely protect them!), Eva's mother coming off of her pedestal for true love with Eva's dad and Trey finding peace and love in his life. I truly love reading about this couple and how they are solving the issues that arise in their relationship. I guess I'm just a romantic with a totally smutty side, lol!
B00881VLCE|5.0|When I'm bored I normally do puzzles. So when I found this app I thought it would be a couple of puzzles but it wasn't. You can buy a lot of puzzles for free and there are a lot of awesome puzzles.
0061730335|5.0|The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind follows William's life through harsh circumstances (poverty, famine, epidemics) to a wonderful result that changes his life and those of many others. He faces the challenges with a supportive family, a faith in God, and a subtle sense of humor. Young William has a curiosity and a thirst for knowledge that he has to satisfy by himself, but he uses the results to help his family and his village.  This book is inspirational on so many levels. I loved this book!
0451418433|1.0|Pages 815 to 846 are missing.  Some pages are duplicated so that the page count is probably correct. This ruins a good book.  How can I get these missing pages?
B00CUWWLWG|3.0|Fun to play but costs a lot to upgrade kingdom.  Lots of different play scenarios to keep it interesting and the graphics are lovely.
1490313370|5.0|Excellent stuff. Some readers of the blog may feel short changed, I felt differently.<br />Got the audible version which James narrates, all 4 hours plus!<br />It includes some funny interludes and brings the authors words to life somewhat.  I LOLed many moments. The techniques and methods he uses are easily incorporated into your own life and It's a well structured and content filled product. Well worth getting for free.<br />Highly recommended.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|True Believers is excellent work from Darius Rucker, his best ever!!!  I read the lyrics from the album liner before listening to the CD.  The words painted perfect pictures and evoked emotions.  Darius delivered more than I expected.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|I thought I would like to read this book to see how close to the Castle tv show it would be. It was a quick and enjoyable book. It kept my interest and was funny at times. I recommend this as a good light read.
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Great, fun game for free! Pretty addictive for a free game. To unlock more suits a small Payment is required or you could gain experience to unlock them.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|its so addicting!!!! I love how you can go into different rooms to find objects. the music is annoying though...
B008IJT0CE|5.0|I love all the different settings. Rain with thunderstorm and Zen soft music is my favorite to fall asleep. Thank you for you app !
B00AQF8CJ0|5.0|Just as addictive as cut the rope. Love i, it's so much Fun and you don't have to play against anyone.
B00AESN8XY|4.0|Very good game but the cheats don't allow you to choose what type of plague you can hack on please update it.But. besides that its really a good game.
159463176X|3.0|You had to decide who was speaking to often.  Not as good as the Kite Runner.  Decent story but confusing writing.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I watched the movie a while ago and I thought I need to read the book. The movie is my absolute favorite. It makes me cry so so hard. I cried in the book too. This book does have some parts that are a little bit strange and were not included in the movie, but overall if you loved the movie you will love the book. The book and the movie really do mean so much to me and many other people because some of us can really connect and relate to it so much. I've been waiting for something like this to be written for a while now. Absolutely worth reading. I do think the movie is better but the book is worth reading no matter what. You will not be disappointed. Enjoy one of the best books ever written.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Very addicting app.  Hate the slow accumulation of diamonds though.  I would definitely recommend this for those those that enjoy this type.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|I downloaded this app and needed to free up some memory for some stuff and it ate my memory. Now my kindle won't get rid of the low men symbol and the memory won't restore. Please help if u can.
B004SH40BQ|5.0|This little adapter is exactly what I wanted to go with my Bluetooth Headphones. It is great, and works well :)
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is the best game ever.  It is like having a real horse.  I love it and I think you will to
B0064X7FVE|3.0|Maps take long to display or update. Has caused my Kindle to reboot when using app at times. The Pollen report once started can't be turned off nor does it work correctly or update the map correctly.
B00AF6MF9I|5.0|It's pretty easy to get into it. Kinda typical but it's still really fun. Doesn't take much in game buys to do anything either.
B000MPEIF6|5.0|Was in the mood to watch the Resident Evil movies. Couldn't find them anywhere else but prime allows the instant purchase. I love this feature! :)
B005OCFGTO|5.0|I love Harry Potter and was anxious to see all the movies after reading the books. This order came very quickly so i did not have to wait at all.
B000I8ES70|5.0|Was in the mood to watch the Resident Evil movies. Couldn't find them anywhere else but prime allows the instant purchase. I love this feature! :)
0385349831|2.0|This was all lesson, and no story. In a question and answer format, it was a main character expounding on life lessons. It was boring and not at all engaging. But it was short, so at least I can say I finished it.
B0086700CM|5.0|I love this game! It is SO much fun and EXTREMELY addictive! I would recommed this to EVERYONE! now I just need to waste space. :)  Thank you for reading!
0770437400|2.0|The novel consists of individual narratives ranging from 2-6 pages from people all over the globe who survived a zombie war. Some sections are fairly engrossing but for the most part, it deals with political and governmental dealings which I found dull to the extreme. I trudged through, thinking it would get better, but the book never takes off. There are no major or recurring characters - I'm not sure how a screenplay was written but I'm assuming it is vastly different from the book (and hopefully better!).
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I liked this book overall. Setup a few more routes to follow. Glad to see a little more length coming to the series
B00992CF6W|5.0|this game is one of the bbest game ive played when me and my friends have sleep overs we play this game all night. I think it is totally worth the $7 and I think it should cost 10!!!
B0086700CM|5.0|Is liked it so much I'm surprised that they made a second temple run I love it sometimes it has weird glitches but I like it it is way easier on the kindle you have more of a screen than an iPod but I suggest getting both of these games have fun and enjoy
B009PK9SB8|4.0|Bottom line: Great addition if you don't mind the tradeoff for battery life<br /><br />Several times a year, I particpate in high performance driving events around the U.S. in my Nissan 240SX and I was looking for a way record the events from a driver perspective.<br /><br />My setup: GoPro Hero 3 Black edition with suction cup mounting accessories.<br /><br />The reason I wanted the LCD (since the GoPro Android app works great,) was to quickly setup the camera position and review footage without using my phone. In addition, I plan on using an external microphone and this LCD is the only way to utilize an external microphone on the Hero 3.<br /><br />After several track runs with other cars, mounting it on driver's side quarter panel glass seemed to yield the best results with the sealed case that is included with this package.<br /><br />I'll add to this review after a few more track events, but right now I think it's worth the sub-one hundred dollar investment for the convenience and microphone port addition.
1554072840|5.0|My daughter and I read this book every time she uses the potty. She loves it. I like that it has clear descriptions of body parts but isn't over the top for my 2 year old.
B005IU1OMA|5.0|Outstanding........the views and shooting of this movie is the best!  There isn't a better snowboarding or skiing movie anywhere...Thank You for the sponsor
1451695187|5.0|Bought this for my Mother In Law. She read it in a couple of days. She really enjoyed it. I am about to read it right now too. :)
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|I should have read through the negative reviews as this doesn't work on my Galaxy SII even though I have root access and am running a very stable ROM. I don't plan on trying it on any other device now that I'm seeing the permissions that it's asking for.  It would be nice to have a good white noise app for the road, but apparently this isn't it.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|There are very few books that I've read that I don't want ruined by any subsequent movie viewings; Max Brooks has made that list with &#34;World War Z&#34;. Yes, it's episodic. No, it doesn't &#34;flow&#34; like a typical novel. But if you expect anything typical or normal from the son of Mel Brooks, you're out of luck like the first loser at the World Series of Poker. This is an excellent book-- funny as hell in places, scary as hell in others. And yeah, it's a better love story-- to the human spirit-- than &#34;Twilight&#34;.
B007IXWKUK|4.0|I liked this one way better than the 1st but omg does it leave you hanging on  at the end. I was thinking how is there a 3rd but the twist only makes me want to get into the 3rd book sooner!
0802473156|5.0|Very informative and teaches you the differences in the types of love and personality each person displays to the special one in their lives.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|FINALLY! I had this on preorder and was thrilled to b able to finally watch the show on DVD! I LOVED IT! I can not wait for season 4 to see what happens next!!
B005JE7WKI|5.0|What a good movie. Well written great acting.  A few twists. A lot of laughs.  The wife and I enjoyed this flick
B002ZG99G8|5.0|Got this for $5 and it was worth every penny. Action movie that doesn't take itself too seriously, pulls off nice drama with surprisingly dead on comic relief.
B001DJLD1M|5.0|I had only seen the original movie &#34;The Matrix&#34;.  Sequals were just as good. The package was like new, and all DVD's were in excellent condition.  The item arrived promptly.  No complaints.
B00DF0POXA|2.0|It's impossible to recount the amount of times throughout the album I actively wondered, \\"Did he just say that?\\" While hyperbole and shock can be useful tools for attention-grabbing, they rarely contribute to an album that will stand the test of time.  And while my two-word review would typically feel blasphemous, in light of having been lyrically violated for 40 mintues, it seems pedestrian: \\"Yeezus Christ.\\"  This one was a little bit way too over the top.
B0061S073A|5.0|I've paid over $100 for games, coins, whatever my son is buying from inside his games even when I was using Zoodles.  I tried this and so far no more charges.  I'm very happy with this app.
0316113514|5.0|A friend recommended this book to me (it changed his life), so I went ahead and bought it for myself. From the moment I picked up this book I was amazed by the research. The message is simple, yet for many incomprehensible in a fundamental level. Your body needs you to move and by doing so, your body and mind become stronger. And who would want to have a weak mind or body;  since the first comprises the stemming majority of all bodily illnesses? And who like to feel crippled by the incapacities of a weak body?
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Solid game really fun keeps you entertained lots of levels<br />Cool graphics and good music in background<br />Not boring very interesting
B009MYARIK|5.0|Took me two days to finish. Great beach read. nothing too complicated. Love Sophie kinsella. Her books are always so fun.
B009FZFONO|5.0|Show is great but this comment is on the Amazon Instant Video service.  We cut cable about 2 years ago so we watch most things through streaming services or just wait until they make it to video.  We loved having the season pass.  It is super convenient and nice that they charge whenever the episode is ready.  I'm kinda cheap when it comes to paying for video/music so it was much better to see the $2-something charge a few times than like $30 or $40 all at once. The video quality was fantastic and we liked being able to watch whenever.  We will probably do it again with the next season.
B003O86FMW|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is very entertaining and addicting to read. I would recommend this book and the other two to anyone wanting to pick up a book.
B0090P98Z4|5.0|I love this game. It's fairly simple, but it totally dragged me in. However I was at level 61, and somehow it kicked me back to level 1. This is the second time it's done this. I don't think I'm going to try it again.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is very entertaining and addicting to read. I would recommend this book and the other two to anyone wanting to pick up a book.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway surfer is addictive! The graphics are bright and colourful I love the fact you visit different countries experience different types of courses. I love getting a new character to play as and getting a new surf board with new skills. The new keys that save you are another good asset to the game.I would totally recommend this game to any one . It's easy to pick up and you will end up playing it every day! Xxxx
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|The Hunger Games trilogy is very entertaining and addicting to read. I would recommend this book and the other two to anyone wanting to pick up a book.
B0073LWEXK|4.0|I thought it was great, not for the full price but it did provide entertainment while I commuted on the train to work. The tips page was useful.
B00CFA222M|4.0|Did'nt expect much...possible something like the the original story that we all<br />have heard through our youth... But no, this has the feeling like the movie<br />Jack the Giant Killer, which was done years ago on a limited budget. So with a<br />bigger budget, we have a great looking castle, soldiers and entourage, and for what it is, a pretty good story. And they could have ended the movie at different parts<br />like most cheap companies would do...but they decided to add to the movie and<br />make the ending even more interesting....love the battles...love the giants and<br />their characters....I have been entertained.<br />A keeper for sure.
B001TH16DI|4.0|The sound could be better, but this is a great set, and a must have for sci-fi fans.<br />The Wrath of Khan of course is the best, video and sound wise.
B001FB5634|4.0|In The Road, a father seeks the coast 8 to 10 years after some cataclysmic event.  Nuclear war?  Armageddon?  Biological warfare?  I couldn't tell the reason, but the outcome was clear.  No terrestrial animals.  No living plants. And the people have developed a culture of cannibalism.<br /><br />What is a father and son to do?  The last wish of the mother was to have them head south, toward the coast.  So they do.<br /><br />The director focused on a dirty, dark future.  The son, however, really didn't seem like a boy raised in this post-apocalyptic world, seemingly whining a lot.  But I kept waiting for a knight in shining armor to come, to rescue the good guys and punish the bad guys.  Will the knight show up?<br /><br />I haven't read the book the movie is based on.  Is it also depressing?
B0001CCY7E|5.0|We never tire of this one. Arguably Kevin Costner's best work and a wonderful story about the Souix in all of their greatness as a people.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Can't run it. Got an error window &quot;internal service error&quot;, then crashed to home screen. I want my money back.
0062255657|4.0|Gaiman has offered up a simple story that speaks on childhood and memory. I've always enjoyed his particular perspective. He writes in a very personal, unafraid way. This is a short novel. It has its share of quirky thrills and exploration of myths and fables, but the real value of this book reveals itself in the voice of a tired, wounded adult remembering the way the world was when it seemed new. This book has been billed as a novel \\"for adults\\", but it feels aimed at the child within us all. With his usual blend of sweetness, melancholy and sometimes muted dread, Gaiman paints a world where all the barnacles life leaves us with become evident in comparison to what seemed most vital in our formative years. There is little of the complexity, action or intensity of some of his earlier works, but it would take a truly hard heart to eventually put this one down without a smile.<br /><br />Thanks, Neil. Innocence deserves its place still.

B00DC7N9NS|5.0|This movie is great and my kids and I loved it. Would recommend this movie to others. Will be buying it on DVD.
B00COQU0D0|5.0|I was disappointed when I read that Jay Z was in charge of the soundtrack. As it turns out, his song, which leads off the mix, is the only bad track. The music here jumps to the beat of the Roaring Twenties with a modern twist. Great mashups including Beyonce, Will i Am, Brian Ferry, Coco O, Emili Sande and Gotye.<br /><br />Jack White's rendition of slow burning rocker Love is Blindness (From U2s classic Achtung Baby) is stunning.<br /><br />Sia's contribution at end is weak. The XX are very good.<br /><br />My favorite trax are by Fergie (whom I don't usually like), Lana Del Rey and Florence + The Machine.<br /><br />See the movie first and see what all the buzz is about. With all the crap movies out there...really, can we blow up earth one more time?...treat yourself to a really good movie. Gatsby Rocks! Then each song here will resonate more for you. Jay Z did a really good job pulling together talent and working into the story.<br /><br />F. Scott Fitzgerald would love this movie and soundtrack. What are you waiting for? Hop to it!!
B005MHI0QM|4.0|This diary is fascinating. It is terrible to know so many people were treated brutally during this era. God bless them.

1590171993|5.0|Stoner is probably the most underappreciated American novel of the 20th century.  It is a marvelous blending of the physical, mental, emotional and spiritual lives of its characters, and Williams writes with such care and tenderness for them that the story, though perhaps mundane, becomes a revelation.  The title character seems to live a relatively uneventful life, but after you have read the book, you see how Stoner has discovered passion in both his vocation and his heart.  My only problem was with the portrayel of the daughter, who seemed less than three-dimensional.  However, all in all, this is a remarkable achivement in literature.
B00A8ECU24|5.0|this game is awesome. you get to explore other peoplenmagic.pony places andnyou get to expandnon yours. iyou never know what the ponies are going tondonnext.
0062255657|4.0|Does this book measure up to Neil Gaiman's best works (what I consider such of course)? Probably not, but on it is own it is a very good book IMO. As other reviewers said his writing is always a delight and him mixing up myths and reality and fears of the childhood in this story worked well for me.<br /><br />As an aside, I could not believe that it actually took time for me to get what mythology figures were the basis for Letty's family LOL. Should have clicked right away :-).
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Really makes you think creatively.  The numbers and shapes test the memory. Highly recommend for those with poor memory as a strengthening tool.
B007VUA7VO|5.0|This is a brilliant app not only does it give you overall battery information ie what is remaining and remaining charge time but it also gives estimates of how long the battery will last depending on task. This is great when deciding whether to start watching a film without running out of battery half way through.<br />In my experience of using this app all estimates have been pretty accurate.<br />Would definitely recommend this app to all Kindle Fire users.

0679746323|5.0|Don't be intimidated by the thickness of the book, it is an easy read.  &#34;Mao&#34; is so riveting its hard to put it down.  Mao was a man<br />obsessed with obtaining and keeping power and cared nothing for the Chinese people.  It was staggering for me to think that<br />while I was in college, Mao was starving 70 million Chinese people to death.  When you are done with the book the question will<br />be &#34;Why do the Chinese people still revere Mao so much&#34; and &#34;Why is there always a huge line of people outside Mao's tomb<br />waiting to see the preserved body of this despicable man.

0920236251|5.0|The story is very positive and lets girls know they can be whatever they want no matter what someone else tells them. My daughter likes walking around saying she is a princess so I wanted her to know princesses do not have to be how they have been portrayed in the past. I figure this book will help me teach her what princess really are like - strong, funny, smart and can stand on their own, if needed.

B00COQKE2M|5.0|Not too many bands have the balls to try something like this, especially in their second album release, but they pull it off. My first love is heavy music, hardcore, metal, and recently some electronic. This album satisfies all my musical tastes and blends them nicely while Ronnie stays true to his Escape the Fate roots. It can be a little cliche at times and some verses made me cringe but they usually make up for that. Overall its a very unique and ballsy album for a \\"post-hardcore\\" band. Ronnie Radke has a vision and by god he's gonna create it.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|The horrible part of this game is how addicting it is!  I spend most of my game time on this one when there are so many others to play. The music is better than what's found in most games, the graphics are top notch and the ads for other games are easy to ignore...despite what others say. Maybe having learned to tune out kid-noise makes it easier to tune out ads.
1603580557|5.0|One of the seminal works in the field of Systems thinking. Although not a Systems Engineer by training, I found this book to be very accessible to even the layman beneficial in my understanding of systems and processes. My lone criticism of this book, which is by no means the fault of the late Ms Meadows is that the examples might read more like history lessons to the younger generation.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I use the app all of the time.  App needs some adjustment to fit kindle screen. Info provided is complete and accurate.

B003XF1XOQ|1.0|I love reading and especially series... but really I dont see what everyone sees. I got all three books and read them in less then a week. The first book was good, now amazing but kept me on my toes. The second one started out good and slowly was losing me. Then this third one..... are you kidding me. I finished it for the principle because I was hoping it would get better but it was a terrible ending. This book ruined the whole series for me. I should have known the only person I knew that read the series said the same thing about book three.... too bad I heard their review after I read it.

0425263924|3.0|I loved this series but I am very disappointed with this book.<br /><br />****This review may contain some spoilers****<br /><br />What the heck is going on with Eva? I understand that Gideon killed for her but that doesn't mean that she should turn a blind eye to all his lies, indiscretions, and secrets.<br /><br />If the next book is the same way I won't be reading the fifth book. That is sad because I really did like this series. I couldn't wait to read this book and it left me very angry instead of excited for the next book. :-(<br /><br />I just can't accept the way the characters are acting. If Gideon is so scared of her leaving, then why does he keep giving her reasons to? As I said before, what happened to the Eva that I knew and loved? Where is her sense of self preservation?<br /><br />I have so many issues that I don't know where to start. Corinne needs to die a slow and painful death. I HATE her and the fact that Gideon told Eva twice that he was done with her and then he met with her anyway, unacceptable! What was he doing with her that he couldn't respond to Eva's text? And why was it on more than one occasion? Why would he leave Eva with Brett to go see Corinne? See what I mean? It just doesn't make sense. The fact that Eva doesn't question it makes even less sense.<br /><br />Then there is the whole hospital scene. Again she doesn't question it. What women wouldn't demand answers? Did he know? Is that why he wanted Eva to marry him? Is that why he kept talking to Corinne? Again unacceptable!<br /><br />What was supposed to be a great love story between to disfunctional people has turned into something absurd and sickening.<br /><br />Great sex is not a cure all and if someone was as broken as Eva, they wouldn't do a complete 180 no matter how much they loved someone.<br /><br />Then there is the reporter. What is going on between her and Gideon? Add in Anne Lucas, Megumi's disappearance, and the sudden appearance of a supposed tape of Eva and Brett. I feel like Sylvia Day should have wrapped up one situation before starting so many others.<br /><br />I'll be reading the next book. I expect to see Eva get a backbone, ask questions and demand answers. I expect her to get real answers and not accept the line of BS she so often accepts.<br /><br />I expect Gideon to be worthy of Eva's love and to quit being deceptive about the other women in his life. I hope that the Corinne situation is quickly and neatly wrapped up and ended because if I the reader has had enough, how the hell has Eva not had it as well? If these things don't happen, I won't be able to continue with this series.I feel like Sylvia Day should have wrapped up one situation before starting so many others.<br /><br />I'll be reading the next book.

What's more it's on Blu-ray and has both the theatrical version (not in blu-ray) and the unrated version in blu-ray which I look forward to watching because all GR8 movies deserve to B viewed more than once on as many different media devices as possible!

B00CKJ2KK2|1.0|Bad for tablets and phones. Game will constantly delete your upgrades and levels and make you restart. Multiplayer rarely works and the controls are extremely hard to master. This game should only be on a PC. If these problems were fixed, I would love this game

B0087X728K|5.0|Arctic Silver 5 is probably the best thermal compound that I have ever used, and I have used many. I have used it both in CPUs and GPUs and it does a phenomenal job at cooling my components. It keeps my 4770K very cool both in idle and under load. At idle the CPU stays around 33C and under load it hovers around 76C which is overclocked at 4.6Ghz. I'm using an H100i from Corsair to cool my CPU and it works very well with Artic Silver 5. The CPU stays below 65c while playing games such as Battlefield 3 and Crysis 3 on max settings.<br /><br />I know there are people out there who just go straight ahead and use the pre-applied thermal paste that comes with the CPU and get horrible temps. If you are going to spend a lot of money on a high end CPU then you might as well spend a few more bucks on a quality thermal compound. It doesn't add much to the cost of a build and it's worth it in the end because you will get much lower temps than with pre-applied thermal paste.<br /><br />Even when using Prime95, the CPU still stays very cool thanks to this awesome thermal paste. I use the pea method and have always gotten good results. I know some people use the single strip method right in the middle of the CPU and spread it out but I have found that the pea method works better.<br /><br />I did some comparisons against the pre-applied thermal paste that comes with most CPUs/GPUs and found out that Artic Silver 5 dropped my temps around 7-10c. Artic Silver 5 comes with plenty of paste that can last a long time. Make sure you do it right because some people have their own methods which sometimes works and sometimes doesn't. If you don't apply it right, you may even get worse temps than before. Putting just the right amount of thermal paste between your CPU and your cooler makes all the difference, trust me.<br /><br />My main rig:<br /><br />Case: Corsair 650D<br />GPU: EVGA GTX 780<br />CPU: Intel Core i7 4770K (still experimenting)<br />PSU: Corsair AX850<br />Ram: Kingston 16GB of RAM<br />SSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GB<br />MB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87<br />OS: Windows 7 64bitof RAM<br />SSD: Samsung 840 Pro 256GB<br />MB: ASUS Sabertooth Z87<br />OS: Windows 7 64bit

B004SJ3BCI|5.0|Awesome game to play...really challenges you to re-think your strategies on every level you struggle to beat. Great game for my Amazon Kindle Fire.
B008JFUPK8|5.0|Man of steel is in a word amazing. Yous should go see it,it is the one movie so far this summer that is worth the money and I am going to say something I never say. If you can get to a 3D or Imax showing see it there because there are some very impressive shots that are just a lot of fun in 3D and I can't imagine how good they would look in Imax,this is the must see movie of the summer. Word of warning to old school Superman fans,don't go in expecting this to have the same feel as Superman the movie(1978),because this film is a completely different animal and that is what makes it so great. Now don't get me wrong Superman the movie is number 5 on my list of all time favorite films so I am not putting it down but this film has nothing to do with that film and is the better for it. There is no denying that Superman Returns was a failure in part because it was so slavish to the 78 film and because of that it really didn't bring anything new to the table. This film creates it's own superman universe and that is what makes it so good.<br /><br />I don't want to get into the plot because that will spoil it but I will say that Warner Brothers seems to have listened to an addressed every complaint about that movie with Man of Steel. It is origin story but it is one that is pretty much packed with action from the first minute and doesn't let up yet it still takes the time needed to let you get to know the characters.  It is very good looking film and as always Zack Synder brings energy and just a great eye for what looks good on camera. In the past I have have always enjoyed the look of Synder's movies but have found them lacking in the story and character department,well teaming him up with Goyer and Nolen seems to be the best thing that could have happened.  They have come up with a great script that gives all the characters something to do and with Nolen as producer Synder seems to have grown up and this film has a maturity and brains too it that his over movies don't have and I hope he continues to work with this team because his images teamed with a script this good produces something that is just a joy to see on the big screen.<br /><br />I would just like to say that this movie also features the most mature version of Superman and Lois Lane I have ever seen. They both act like adults,have brains,work well together,and just get along in such a way that they both feel like strong characters who are more complete together. In other words this movie made me care about the love story between the Superhero and his girlfriend and that is something most movies of this type fail to do. So I take my hats off to everyone.<br /><br />The whole cast is great but I will single out Henry Calvin and Amy Adams for praise since the movie rests on their shoulders and if they didn't work the whole thing would fall apart.<br /><br />Calvin is great. He plays Superman his own way but feel just like Superman. He is not Reeves but he doesn't have to be because every time he was on screen I believed he was Superman. Superman is one of the hardest characters to play because an actor has to projected a commanding presence,compassion,a sense of joy,and the idea that Superman know how much is riding on him all at once. Then in the scenes with Lois he has to convey that despite being so close to perfect he really does love and need her and Calvin does all of this.<br /><br />I have to admit I was dead set against Amy Adams as Lois Lane. She seemed wrong for the part to me and I was sure it was stunt casting but let me tell you crow has never tasted so good. She brings everything to the role. She is a hard ass when she needs to be with out becoming unlikable. She clearly cares about people and she has chemistry with Calvin and she never is just standing by and doing nothing or just getting into trouble. You really believe that she is a smart caring woman who Superman could fall in love with but the great thing is she doesn't play it as so many others have asa schoolgirl crush. Both Adams and Calvin play it very real and the movie is all the stronger for it. Even when she wasn't directly involved with Superman's life I found myself caring about her part of the story and that is all down to how well the character was written and just what a great job Adams did playing it so I take my hat off to her.<br /><br />The action is of course amazing and as I said this is well directed and it is a fun film,you really feel like you have been on a ride at the end. Is it perfect? No but no film can be and this is about as perfect as a super hero film gets so if you can get over the fact that this doesn't continue the Reeves series I say go out and see it now as far as summer blockbusters go this is so much better then what we normally get. 10/10.a schoolgirl crush. Both Adams and Calvin play it very real and the movie is all the stronger for it.

B008UCJ7KO|3.0|This book kept me interested. More so than the second one. I am just wondering what more could possibly cone for Gideon and Eva. It seems like they need closure already. There were some beautiful parts between them in this book and I like how it didn't focus so much on the negativity of their past but their growth and hopes for the future. I just don't see enough in the plot to stretch out another book in this series. I wish it would have resolved Gideon's problems and ended with this one.
B001ANSSDC|5.0|I haven't finished a book and thought \\"Wow\\" in quite some time.

B008UCJ7KO|2.0|I have never written a review, but this book prompted my first. I am very glad that i waited and did not buy this book. Instead, a friend was able to get on the library list and get this book immediately upon release for free. Good thing too, because i was so mad at the way it abruptly ended as well and the BS fluff throughout th story. I cannot believe there will be a 4 and 5.  Unnecessary.  I like a triligoly, was told it was the final in a trilogy and expected just that. I will probably ready 4 and 5, but WILL NOT pay for any more of her books. Very Disappointed Ms. Day.
0062255657|5.0|I, like many others, have been eagerly awaiting this book. It does not disappoint. Neil Gaiman has been known to write about the same thing in different (wonderful) ways. This is not a bad thing. What is it they say about a writer? That they are always writing the same book over and over, but in different exciting forms? I say this as a way to get in, as a preface to the fact that this book makes complete sense as part of his Work, and yet is irreparably different.<br /><br />In some ways, this novel is recognizably autobiographical - the author himself admits this in the afterword. It also happens to be his saddest novel. This novel may be only 192 pages, but it will seep into you. That is in fact, my only minor complaint - the shortness of the entire affair. Just when you get into the meat of the story, it's over. Yes, objectively, I can say - this is a tightly plotted novel - but I was never one to care much about plots. For me, it's all about the experience of getting to the end. I didn't want the characters to go away. I hope he revisits the Hampsteads at some point. They are just as worthy of a caveat as Shadow was in Fragile Things. Still, I don't think the shortness of the work detracts from it in any serious way. Certainly, it won't affect my rating.<br /><br />To reiterate - I read Gaiman for the liquidity and lushness of his prose, and his imagery, and the fascinating things he does with myth and metaphor. This book has all of that in spades. Just let it wash over you, like an ocean.*<br /><br />  *A little on the head, or nose, I know - but your body should be able to handle it.

I chose this book due to my general interest in science and Nikola Tesla in particular.<br />What I thought was gonna be a test of one page reading, turned into reading the whole thing without stopping, and missing dinner :) It is very easy to read, smart, keeps you amused and dares you to question evrything you do.<br />All I can say is thank you Sean for playing with my mind and motivating me to question, to be creative and imaginative.
B00C2U6G7C|1.0|I am not comparing Zimmer's score to Williams....like HELL I'm not!  If you intend to remake/rewrite any of Shakespeare's plays, you had better be up to it. Zimmer had the choice of accepting the responsibility of rising to the level of Williams' grand scale score--but he chose to escape it.  Perhaps he was not asked to do this.  However, the natural, competitive drive in him should have generated the effort.<br /><br />Granted, this Superman is no Romantic as was Richard Donner's,and this is all the more reason to invest in rich melody, dazzling counterpoint, and expansive orchestration.  Williams brought all of that and more to the 1978 film.  Zimmer brings hackneyed Zimmer to this film.  He is capable of inventive work--the first Sherlock Holmes film brought us an adventurous, thoughtful, and creative Zimmer--every bit as clever as Holmes himself.  This Zimmer is incapable of lush \\"anything.\\"  He is either bombastic or muddled. Perhaps Zimmer was just not inspired by the film itself--I don't really know.  But here is a case where the music cannot rise to the level of the film and the film cannot rise to the level of the 1978 film.  Too, Too, \\"super\\" bad.<br /><br />It is possible that nobody could have written a memorable soundtrack for such a miserable movie.  \\"Man of Steel\\" lacks everything--it is charmless and witless. Zod reads his lines mechanically while Lois overdoes poise to the level of a pathology. And poor Superman; he can fly but nobody has shown him how to walk comfortably on screen. Let's be candid--he hasn't one clever or interesting thing to say and he can be seen reading \\"warm--as if you love people\\" as a direction.  from a script.  Worse--someone told him to \\"flash a Christopher Reeve\\" smile and--sadly--he does it several times, looking very much like a large Schnauzer each time. The movie's action scenes are convoluted and noisy.  So--really--could Zimmer have modulated any of this with a spectacular score--even if he had it in him to write one?  I doubt it....but he should have tried anyway.
1907947655|4.0|Would be 5 stars except for the mislabeling. A nice edition of the TEXT! I was disappointed with he lack of illustrations.
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|I'm not sure why everyone gave such bad reviews. Yes, there is again a bunch of unanswered questions but what I wanted to know from the last two books I got out of this book for the most part. I for one am glad that this story is carrying onto another book in this series! I couldn't put this book down so I look forward to seeing what will happen. Hopefully the release will be sooner rather than later : )
0060989157|5.0|This was a gift to a guy who likes Motley Crue.  I think any Motley Crew fan would love reading this book.
B003F5NSTW|4.0|I had put off watching the film of this book because I felt it needed to be read first, and I was not disappointed. the structure the author chose was astute: it kept things hidden from us but we as readers were not aware of that. As a result, the reader has to constantly restructure his/her schema for the story. The ending was stunning and shocking and disturbing but it was appropriate to the development of the story and I gasped aloud at it. This is a piece of modern literature.
B007L96VCY|5.0|It was a GREAT album on vinyl in the early 70's and still is now in the remastered version. The second disc is just fill.......take it or leave it.
B00CSR2J9I|4.0|I got this app for my grandchildren and they like it even though it is a little hard to control at times. Sometimes the<br />car tips over and they lose control but it isn't so discouraging that they give up quickly. It is a cute game for kids.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Good time waster. Slightly challenging. Could be a little better with the interactions and the involvement of the puzzles but overall pretty fun
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This app plays just like angry gran but it is fun to do. Good graphics for a free app. Glad I have it.
B003W5C0VM|4.0|If you ignore Jagger's facial glitter, eye-liner, and uncoordinated strutting, the music makes up for it.<br />The Mick Taylor years were fantastic - the only years when the Stones had a superb guitar player. The footage of Nicky Hopkins makes the price of the disc worth it all by itself!
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game is really fun keeps the mind working. I really like all the puzzles and codes. So far I am not bored like I get with other seek and find games.
B009186JNO|4.0|The footage was meticulously enhanced, so that everything was very clear on my big screen. I grew up with the Stones, and personally like the Brian Jones era the most. My only disappointment is that I wish there had been more concert footage. Still, this is well worth owning for any Stones fan.
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is the best app ever that's all I can say.  I never found a better app like this and subway surfers.
B009T3AE1Y|3.0|You have to be a fan of Robert Pattinson to really stay with this movie.  It would lose me at certain points.
B0049J3QAY|2.0|So started off fine but then froze up halfway through ( I also get Netflix and Never has that frozen up....so not an issue with my internet)... finally got it back on BUT it was definitely NOT HD,  less than regular quality... No point in calling Amazon's customer service... last time this happened ( the freeze up happens often with them - again not with ANY other channel I use HD or not) they just made me wait on hold in the middle of the movie recharge me for it and finally we got to finish watching.. I mean this is an OLD movie and not a super cheap rental.... So yeah don't charge for HD if it is less than regular quality...
B00CTSDDVO|5.0|If you liked the original Wrath of Khan, then you'll likely love Into Darkness! Benedict Cumberbatch is one intense Khan and keeps you on your toes throughout the movie - it's hard to tell what he's fighting for, which is what makes him so hard to figure out. It's hard to figure out what everyone is fighting for in this movie, most of the characters are even trying to figure out who they are fighting for - which makes the entire movie so interesting with no lack of action!
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a alright game. I found one puzzle took some thinking but other than that the puzzles were easy. To bad there isn't more levels.
1439156816|5.0|King injects his usual visceral and evocative prose into what could have otherwise have been a dry discourse on the life of a writer.  I find it hard to believe that I was riveted from start to finish while reading a non-fiction book on the life of a writer.  A testament to the talent of Stephen King.  If you are a writer or thinking of becoming one, get this book.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|The case its self was ok but it came scratched and with an air bubble and if the product is &#34;new&#34; none of that should have been on the case or happened. and the top of the screen didnt work and mine was NOT waterproof.
B008KOTNVA|4.0|The set is great. The bits are strong and hold up well under pressure.<br />The adapter to a normal bit size is great, although it would be better if it was magnetized. (It often drops bits)<br />The kit is pricey but worth it for the quality.
B009GQ57ES|5.0|There was a great deal on amazon for this album only 4 bucks, so why not, right??  I would have to say that this one of my favorite album for the year.  Great lyrics and the beats are very unique with a lot of mix of different beats and sound.  Check it out, it is worth it!!!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|Don't worry, this is a spoiler-free review. However, if I did tell you the big secret, you might not read the book. I mean, come on, that's the big secret?! Yeesh! I know Mr. Brown had a difficult task after [[ASIN:0307474275 The Da Vinci Code]], but if he couldn't come up with anything better than that, maybe he should have tried a different genre. But then again, the book sold like a bajillion copies before it was even released, and I bought a copy, so who got the last laugh?<br /><br />Literary-wise, the book had decent suspense but I never cared too much about the characters or even what happened to them. The only mildly interesting character was the bad guy, but he was such a wack-job, I didn't even like reading about him much.<br /><br />I guess I'm done reading Mr. Brown. The only thing that kept me reading was to find out what the \\"big secret\\" was, and now I just feel disappointed and let down that the book didn't pay off.
B0084V2R7Q|4.0|This book is actually for my daughter who needs to read this for her summer reading project for when she goes into highschool.
B0015DROBO|1.0|I can't believe this is an international best seller.  The dialogue is wooden, there's way too much description (how many times do we need to hear that the protagonist had coffee?, why do we care what chair he sat in?), and the murder mystery never builds any suspense.<br /><br />I read on Wikipedia that Larsson wrote this and other books just for himself in his spare time.  This one read like it, and it's shocking that the book wasn't heavily edited before publishing.  At 100,000 words instead of 200,000 the book may have been more bearable.
B006H5120E|5.0|This film was a classic the moment it was &#34;put into the can&#34; and released. It contained all the elements of the previous &#34;Titanic&#34; films yet more. The fictionalized account to the two lovers with the added drama of personal interactions of the participants and adversaries, both heroes and dogs made this particular story really engrossing and dramatically impressive. I just had to have the 3D version.
B001974DG0|3.0|Several reviewers mentioned a great conclusion and I was expecting all the story lines to come together into a complex resolution.  However, the secondary characters only came into the main story in a sequential fashion and were dealt with quickly, which was disappointing.<br /><br />The most interesting characters are Lem Johnson, a government agent, and The Outsider, a lab-created intelligent killing machine.  These two characters are the only ones with internal conflicts of values, but neither of these inner conflicts is explored in any great detail.  The main characters, Nora and Travis, overcome personality obstacles early, but after that they only face external obstacles from the other characters.
B003G8Y4QO|5.0|I've been watching the Doctor since my days at the University Of Colorado at Colorado Springs, when the Doctor was fairly new here thanks to PBS. That was a very looong time ago. William Hartnell to John Hurt, John Hurt? That's right the next Doctor is going to be John Hurt. I will withhold judgement until I've seen what this noted actor brings to the milieu. Matt Smith, Karen Gillan, Arthur Darvill and Alex Kingston Are superb in their roles and work together so well as to make the entire experience of Doctor Who as exciting as ever. Matt Smith is another great Doctor, season five, just another astounding season of great fun and drama. Buy it, rent it, but no matter what, you must see it!
B000FA5SMK|4.0|The book was billed as very suspenseful, so I read it to learn how it was done. The book is a basic murder mystery with the added suspense of Plum Island, an island off of New York used for biological warfare research. The book was a good story with a good deal of suspense, but it wasn't quite the page-turner that I had hoped for--maybe my expectations were too high.
B009HQ9UHC|5.0|It is like Angry Birds it's addictive the best game to be creative and is fun for all ages and, puts your mind to work.
B002DW92SE|4.0|Nick Hornby (High Fidelity, About a Boy) is a great writer, and I enjoyed this book.  Hornby lets us get deep into the character's head, similar to the way Stephen King does, and I like that.  We really get to know the three main characters:  Duncan and Annie, who are in a stale relationship, and Tucker Crowe, a retired rocker.<br /><br />My only complaint is that Hornby could have done more with the situations.  He set up some good conflicts, but they didn't pay off like I thought they would.  (I suppose I have the same complaint about High Fidelity, a movie I wanted to like but couldn't.)
B009UX2YAC|5.0|I love this game because the boy true to escape from the cop and he jumps on trains and ducks and jumps over stuff[[ASIN:B00BUS5JPW Subway Surfers: Tips, Tricks and Cheats - A Subway Surfer Complete Guide]]
B002SAUCBC|3.0|I read that this was Stephen King's first novel, written when he was 20 and in college.  As I understand it, he later revised it and published it as a \\"Bachman Book.\\"  I read it mainly to compare King's early work to his later work, which I think is excellent.  I wanted to see the degree to which King developed his ability.<br /><br />The Long Walk was well written in terms of style (which could have been accomplished while editing later), but lacked the depth of character and plot which are present in King's later novels.  The Long Walk refers to a walk to the death run as some kind of national sport in an alternate reality of the United States which has somehow become a dictatorship.  The novel starts and ends with the Long Walk which makes a nicely delimited plot for a beginning author to work within.<br /><br />Overall, my reading of The Long Walk accomplished my purpose.  I saw that King's ability to create interesting characters and plots developed as he wrote--practice does indeed make perfect!
067942850X|4.0|I really enjoyed this book very much, and this book was I needed to read it for school. I live it.
B0035G9ABQ|5.0|I am a fanatic of Gorillaz since his first CD. This a very very good Cd. With really amazing hits and other songs just for chill out. Totally recommended.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|Dis game reminds me of this pc game i once had on my laptop da game is awsome you really need to download it now not later now
B0085RQLXK|3.0|After many years of wait for a new studio material from Aerosmith, it comes to me,  music from another dimension. The most of the songs are good. but it take many many times to hear the record for begin to apreciate his music. In fact is a goog beggining after many years since just push play.  But for me the last GREAT CD of aerosmith is nine lives !!
B0063IH60K|5.0|I have  enjoyed playing Klondike ever since I was a kid back in the '40s.This version is exactly the same even down to the Vegas scoring method I used. I'm not sure what the problem is with the pop-up ads. I see only one ad immediately after each shuffle. That's all. Just ONE after each shuffle. That's not much of an inconvenience compared with playing with a real deck of cards. Get a life folks!
B008MEM24S|5.0|Its more fun than the game, \\"wheres my water\\" to me. I am up all nite playing this one. Plus my kids love phenius and ferb.
B00C2U6G7C|2.0|Hans Zimmer is one of the best of the current crop of film music composers and has done some wonderful work, but his score for \\"Man of Steel\\" is not one of them.  First off the packaging and production values for this presentation are first-rate and are not an issue. And it should be said that this was one of those thankless tasks that took some courage to take on.  It is also understood that the challenge was to score this film without reference to or worries about John Williams' iconic score of 1978; the result is something that punctuates what is on the screen from moment to moment but is simply nothing special or memorable and in this case that is not enough.  The score does work quite well for the first part of the film on Krypton (one of the strongest parts of the movie) but aside from a great deal of percussion and bombast does not really go anywhere from that point on.  A subtle and singular theme is there but is perhaps too subtle for such a super film (\\"super\\" as a description, not a final assessment).  The fact is Williams' themes kept resonating in the back of the mind from scene to scene despite every conscious effort to embrace Zimmer's score.  A notable effort, but one that this time fell a bit short of super, and that is the operative word here.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|I love these apps! ! libii makes the best apps I think and I have just about every single libii app I can get on my kindle fire !!! I hope they make more.apps soon and I will get them for sure!!!!!!! there so much fun!!!
B000002J1Y|5.0|Wow!  A lot of words have been spilled over Yessongs here, so I won't add too many.  I'll just start by saying that Yessongs might be simply the greatest live album of all time, just so we're clear.<br /><br />Yessongs is one of those albums you can pull out again and again, year after year, and just get caught up in it all over again.  I remember when I was about 12 (1976) an acquaintance gave me his vinyl copy of Yessongs.  (He was going to college in northern California, smoking a lot of dope, and only listening to the Grateful Dead.)  I thought I had died and gone to heaven.  I played that thing so much I just about wore it out.  Now, nearly 40 years later, I find that I need to hear this album (on CD now) at least once every few months.<br /><br />So, what about this \\"progressive rock\\" thing?  Well, the fact is, Yes simply rocked harder than just about any other band.  Yes, their music is intricate -- some might even describe it as \\"symphonic\\" in the sense that it largely consists of tightly composed music that where every instrumental part must be reproduced faithfully in order to achieve the performance -- but that doesn't mean that it is bloodless or cold.  Quite the opposite!  And Yessongs, more than any other Yes album, demonstrates just how hard they could rock.<br /><br />If you have heard Yes's studio creations, then you might very well wonder how these 10- to 20-minute masterworks could possibly be reproduced live by five long-haired lads.  But, reproduce them they do!  Indeed, the live versions of these songs almost always outstrip the studio versions.  Particularly with the tracks from the Close to the Edge album (all of which are also on Yessongs), I would say that the live versions are all better.  For me, though, the high point of Yessongs is Yours is No Disgrace (from the Yes Album).  Steve Howe's extended solo here surely ranks as one of the all-time greatest guitar solos ever caught on tape.  The piece becomes a concerto for rock guitar.<br /><br />I will just finish by saying that Steve Howe is definitely the star here.  After hearing Yessongs (and watching the video), there is no mystery why Steve Howe won the Best Overall Guitarist category of the Guitar Player reader's poll five years in a row in the seventies.  No other rock guitarist at the time could even come close to his combination of technique, melodic inventiveness (he has been called \\"the Charlie Parker of rock guitar\\"), and versatility, and it is all on display in Yessongs.<br /><br />If you love music, and you haven't heard this album, then you know what to do...
B008220D5K|1.0|Boring, doesn't grab your attention.  I would love to take<br />away the star. I haven't been so bored since I've seen<br />Ishtar.  Great for insomniacs

1400079276|4.0|The content of this book is highly creative and inspiring. The characters are complex and evolve over time, which is much appreciated. I enjoyed a lot reading this novel!
B0050DZN4K|2.0|app is many versions behind desktop and android, so it doesn't sync. a major problem for people who want to sync across devices.
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|After reading several reviews, I decided to take a chance on this free app of the day. After downloading, I opened the app and almost immediately my phone froze up and my screen went black. After my phone came back on, I tried opening it again to see if I did anything wrong, again, my phone froze and my screen went black. I immediately uninstalled the app. It's ok as I still got my Relax music app and that one works great. I only downloaded this app to compare it to Relax but can't compare something if the app only freezes and doesn't open.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|That book is my favorite book ever because I felt connected to it and it speaks to you I have to admit I don't like reading letter nooks like that but that I loved <3<3<3 a defiant must read
B00AREIAI8|5.0|When I got this app I didn't think I would be satisfied with it. Boy was I wrong! This app is fun and full of great things to do. I would recommend this app to anyone! You`'ll love it!;)
B009NY43NY|1.0|****CONTAINS SPOILERS****<br /><br />For the most part I love the series until after book 9 which began the slow and painful death to the series. But at least books 10,11, and 12 felt like they were written by Charlaine Harris where books 13 reads like someone who may have glanced at the books but never read them. And when did Sookie start swearing so much? I don't recall her having such a foul mouth in the past books. And the whole plot it self of the book seemed like it was hurried along..and seem to have brought back every character that ever helped her. And having the devil help Amelia's dad is just lame. The ending of the book having Sookie end up with Sam, I saw that from the beginning. I think I would have been more surprised if she got back with Quinn. With that being said it would probably be better to go read some fan fiction because I bet they have a better ending.
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the best app you will ever play you will love the game if you like to build the best
B00CEMH31Q|5.0|Being compared to that of Sly and the family stone all the way to the white stripes, ACDC, and Led Zeppelin - Hanson have created a true gem here. This isn't surprising to fans that have grown with the band and have come to be used to their quality and perfection in their work. Looking forward to the next 20 years guys!
B004SD5GZ4|5.0|It works very well for my new android.  I can put any of my documents on my android and it show up great
B006ZB3V2C|1.0|Normally I would take a look at an app for a while before giving it any sort of review. However, this one was pretty straightforward when it came to usefulness... None.<br /><br />Read the reviews and was aware of the initial message that came up all the time. Not a big deal. The problem came when only one or two buttons were tapped to change sounds and the program would close. Happened like five times in a row. Removed the program and downloaded again with the same result. App removed for good. Fortunately this was a FAOTD and the lesson did not cost me anything.<br /><br />Device: Kindle Fire HD 8.9&quot;
B0064X7FVE|5.0|It works great for the tablet I have.  It is easy to use.  I would recommend it for everyone. Look it over.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Sounds are good quality and lots to choose from. Helped us all sleep better on vacation. Doesn't drain the battery which is great. Don't like that it stops the sound if I access any other functions on my phone.
B003XRELEI|5.0|Very cynical, but very funny, too.  Would recommend to any Baby Boomer.  Don,t know why I did not read this in my younger days.

B007VUCAVO|5.0|This is a great little app that helps me manage my Kindle by giving me the estimated time left for audio, surfing and reading. It's particularly useful when I'm about to embark on a long journey.
B0028MBKVG|4.0|A very interesting and intriguing novel this is. The author does a great job of weaving characters and their backstory into a historic and physiologically revealing true story about man&#34;s oldest sport and survival mechanism -running.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|I loved this series.  A must read for the beach.  Hot and steamy.  You'll be discussing with all you girlfriends.
B005LCYR7Y|2.0|Very heavy reading. I found it too convoluted.It took time to get into the story. Unfortunately, although friends recommended it, it was not my cup of tea.
1400069807|5.0|I enjoyed this book and it helps readers like me understand how food sells and how choices are important in determining what to eat.
014241493X|2.0|i really should love john green- i grew up in orlando and have the same dual fascination/disgust with the area, i lived all the moments where being at a denny's at 11pm on a school night felt, for all the world, like the coolest place you could ever be, and the moments where you feel stifled by the fact that the only place to go at 11pm on a weekend is a f-ing denny's. orlando resonates with me, but john green's characters just... don't.<br /><br />i understand that the point of the book was the deconstruction of the manic pixie dream girl- this girl who seems like the most amazing, interesting person in the world turns out to be a bored teenager who does things simply because she can. unfortunately, every time john green tries to get at the core of girls like this, the portrayal comes up hollow, shallow, and a bit unfriendly to the girls.  his male characters are all awkward nobodys with no ambition and no interests or hobbies, and they're always the hero, the relatable character.  his female characters turn out to be the same, just plain teenagers, but they are somehow at fault for not being as unique and amazing as the boys want them to be.<br /><br />i also understand the suspension of disbelief needed to really enjoy fiction, but... what parents in their right minds would ever let a group of teenagers take off on a 2500 mile road trip by themselves and skip their high school graduations? it took me right out of the story and made me think about all the times my mom almost had a heart attack when i wanted to go to like, tampa to see a band play on a weekend.  i can believe breaking into sea world (what orlando kid hasn't done some good old-fashioned theme park trespassing?), i can believe the clues left by margo, i can even believe that a character as dull as the main character somehow has loyal friends.  i just couldn't get past this!<br /><br />p.s. i respectfully request that john green stop trying to write characters other than lily white nerdy straight men.he just can't get it right.
B009YP9L7U|4.0|The characters were fun. The story was pretty basic but I enjoyed it. I'd recommend it as a fun read to pass the time.

B007KOMTUI|4.0|I just watched one of the episodes that I had accidentally deleted from my DVR. &#34;Mad Men&#34; is a great look back at the sixties if you are old enough to remember it as I am.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|it was very challenging and fun. I thought tht I could.be a little bot harder though but all in all it was very good and educational
B0085YOD1A|5.0|This app quietly carries on with what it does, it doesn't slow down the phone at all,<br />no ads or anything.<br />The only downside is that there isn't a little battery widget in the status bar,<br />although the number percentage status does show up and gets the job done very well.
B000SFJWLU|5.0|What can I say about FFDP? Well they are currently my favorite band and every track is great. Every track with the exception of The Bleeding I would gladly love to kick someone's head in to. I would have angry make up sex to The bleeding. Seriously this album barely leaves my car's cd player.
B00571F26Y|5.0|I haven't even finished the book, but in the first month I lost 12 lbs, making NO OTHER CHANGES. I really wanted to test whether it was the wheat, so I freely ate anything and everything else that month. If I wanted a potato, I loaded it with butter and cheese. Or I made outrageously greasy hash browns with onions and lots of bacon. I ate ice cream. I ate - heavens, I don't even remember what all I ate, but I did NOT diet. And 12 lbs came off anyway. The funny thing was that the person who mentioned the book to me got locked into a mindset of &#34;I have to research this diet and that diet and this other diet .....&#34; After getting text after text from me about how the weight was coming off he finally got organized enough to do a week without flour. By the end of the week he was almost &#34;afraid of how fast the weight was coming off.&#34;<br /><br />A few notes:<br /><br />(1) I stabilized at 12 lbs off; after this I will actually have to not pig out on potatoes with cheese, etc.<br />(2) I didn't use substitutes for wheat-based foods, with one exception: I love my granola with Greek yogurt flavored with pineapple, lime, unsweetened coconut etc., so I bought some wheat/gluten-free granola. But no gluten-free breads, cookies, etc.<br />(3) One of the more amazing things was how much the cravings disappeared. This was really brought home when after 6-weeks wheat-free I indulged at a group restaurant outing where everything - literally EVERYTHING - was served over pasta. I decided not to fight it and just indulged. After a huge meal I found that I came home and kept eating everything in sight. That type of late night constant grazing had largely disappeared while I was wheat-free.<br />(4) Surprisingly - for someone who loves bread - this has been extremely easy. The results, not just in terms of weight loss but more importantly in terms of appetite control, are so motivating that I find it really easy to avoid wheat.<br />(5) OH - when I do find myself eating wheat (usually as a guest where it's hard to avoid), I find my belly swells up and gets hard, something that I think I just accepted as normal before but which I find really noticeable and obnoxious now.<br /><br />AT LEAST - give this a try, whether you buy the book or not!! But if you do it w/o buying the book, make certain you know what all wheat is in. I've been surprised by how many people think it's just bread but not pasta, etc.

B00CSR2J9I|4.0|The game is simple and fun. It rewards players very well and evenly. You do not have to spend money on it to have a good time and it has a bunch of funky thinks you can buy with in game coins. It feels like a flash game of old so done expect much from the graphics or super complicated game play.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Loved it couldn't  put it down. Very intriguing book about 2 people of opposites attracting 2 each other. Despite obstacles giving it all they got and learning and growing together.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I could not put this book down. It kept me guessing and fall in love with the characters even more.  To read how the master plan is set in motion and who the allies are throughout makes me anticipate the pending movie for this book and my reading of the final book.
B00D2K40WY|5.0|This game was so much fun. This game is to cute and my daughters are so loving this game. I am never gonna have my kindle...
0394800184|5.0|I used this a a felt storyboard and the kids loved it! Great story for young kids!! definitely recommend it!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|needs a way that we can sell back our unused stuff.  like our head starts an plus five for coins. other than that the game great.  love the challenges every month if it wasn't for that I would've. stop playing last month.
B005OCFHHK|5.0|I loved the movies and I am a huge fan but getting the whole &#34;trunk&#34; set with all the bonus stuff was too much. I just wanted the movies and this was it. I never end up watching any of the other crap anyway and just end up storing it. Blu ray quality is just unbeatable.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Plays well and very easy to traverse.  I enjoyed the app and would download it again, even my grandson can play it.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|my 2yr old kid learned how to play and now he plays almost better than me! I recommend it for any age :)
B000HWZ4A2|5.0|Having read the book and reviewed the movie 45 years ago, it still has strong impact today. You either believe in the individual or you believe in the collective where everything for every body is the same. Capitalism and Individualism vs. Communism and Oppression.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Before I read this trilogy I had the most ridiculous thoughts about this book.  Of course I was dead wrong.  IT was a delicious LOVE. STORY.  I wanted it to go on forever.  I JUST HOPE THERE WILL BE MORE SORIES.  About the GREY  FAMILY.
B005898DDO|5.0|This is a must for any Dylan fan. I will enjoy watching the DVD's for years to come. I have watched it twice already and it just keeps getting better.
0765325950|5.0|A wonderful read from Jordan and Sanderson.  Epically detailed and very well done.  A shame the original author could not finish the books; however I believe Sanderson does a great job and helped complete this epic book set.
B000ID1J40|5.0|This movie is a must see must have for any fans of tech. Even non techie types will easily follow and enjoy. Packed with an all star cast.
B00D5O7BPU|5.0|In my opinion I think this gun simulator is pretty good if you're a gun lover like me but they could at least add more weapons
B004UID2LC|1.0|Not able to search for what you want to see. Why do I need to say more that's just stupid
B0089EHWQE|4.0|I liked the book because I felt the story explained the ability of a handicapped person to be independant in their thinking and the things that most interested them.  Too often it seems, because a person has a disability, we assume they cannot think independantly.  How wrong we are!  We all need to be more aware of their abilitys and less concerned with their disabilities.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I was very happy to find this in the app store. I have used it on my ancient cell phone for years and have found it to be accurate. Now with my Kindle, it is so much better!
B008FPOIT6|4.0|This was picked for a small book club, just a bunch of likeminded nerds. We could not have chosen a better story. A search for oneself in the harsh reality of adult life, couched in a modern day fairy tale. I loved every minute of it.
0060245867|5.0|Great book, a classic. I really like the game in the back cover too. A perfect book for your child or grandchild.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|would suggest for all ages. keep up the good thinking. it is a fun game.  wish we could play on waiting for more rooms
B00D3V85FA|5.0|Hope it is no coincidence for the Ozzman's liver sake. But really this is solid stuff straight from Sabotage/Vol.4 era, could not believe how good it was on 1st listen, still growing on me...get it straight away.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|For ease of use and variety of sounds, this is up with the best of the other apps I've used. The interface is beautiful and simple. Timer feature is easy and gives some default options for times, but also lets you choose a custom time. Great for sleep, meditation, yoga. I use this every day.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Keeps you busy and keeps you on your toes , it's tons of fun. I would recommend to anyone who want an enjoyable game
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I got this app and it is AWESOME AWESOME AWESOME don't believe it is a battery hog so get this now get
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a really fun game. My thirteen year old sister loves it and is always playing it. I recommend it to animal lovers.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I love these types of games. I hope that as the levels increase, the difficulty factors increase also. This is a game that is a lot of fun for me.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|Its free and its fun! What more can I say?!  I play everyday and if you're a bingo lover like me this the best app on the market
B008MC175A|1.0|I just bought the X-Men Trilogy boxed set, X-Men First Class, and X-Men Origins Wolverine on Blu Ray individually and it only cost $55.47.  You're paying $12 extra for this set, and it doesn't even come with a nice box for the main trilogy.
B008OOYALE|5.0|I love this game! It's one of the main games I get on to everyday! Love to play it so much!
B008CP93S0|5.0|Very enjoyable and fun movie I LOVE Paul Rudd and this move is exactly what you'd expect it to be.
141659521X|5.0|Vince Flynn is a master story writer, he holds your interest from the first time you pick up his book until you finish, a surprise ending  in every book he writes, your attention is always satisfied and your never going to a disappointment with anything he writes.
1476712042|5.0|THIS BOOK ABOUT TWO COLLEGE KIDS WAS WONDERFUL, NOT ALOT OF SEX, AND A BEAUTIFUL STORY. ALSO GET BOOK 2 HE RETELLS THE STORY IN HIS TERMS AND A DIFFERENT ENDING MORE ADDED ON I READ A COUPLE OF TIMES NOW, STILL ENJOY THEM OVER AND OVER.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I got this app thinking it looked fun. once I played it the first time, I was up until 11:30 trying to beat the levels. I just finished and cannot wait for more levels to come.
0425263924|4.0|I LIKED IT BUT WOULD LIKE A LITTLE LESS SEX IN THE HOPEFULLY LAST BOOK AND MORE STORY, PLEASE NO MORE BRETT............. JUST LET THEM BE HAPPY AND END IT. WE WILL ALL BE HAPPY...  PLUS WE WOULD LIKE THE BOOK IN AT LEAST 2 OR 3 MONTHS NOT 7.  OTHERWISE MAY NOT BUY IT..  REALLY LOVED THE FIRST TWO HOEFULLY 4TH ENDS IN A BANG,SOMETHING ALL OF US WILL SAY NOW THATS A ENDING..................
B0009P5YXO|5.0|this product is great. I received it greatly ahead of the predicted date and is a blast to play with. the only one problem I had was if one dose not press the buttons very hard the screwdriver will fizzle out but pressing it harder solved the problem. Overall this is a great product and I greatly recommend this to any Whovian.  Allons-y
B00BTJMS1A|4.0|I beat this game too quickly. Admittedly, it was a lot of fun, even for my 4 year old, and I played for hours. If some more levels can be added, that would be great. The end reminds me of THX 1138 :)
0807014273|5.0|This book is a &#34;must read&#34; for anyone trying to figure out the meaning and purpose of life.  Get rid of your ego, and come to have joy and fulfillment in life!  Was recommended to me as a favorite book of several friends, and it did not disappoint.
B003VANOFY|5.0|Ive been shocked about how good these headsets are! the sound is solid and so is the bass. they are super comfortable and well well worth the price and the fact they are cordless is amazing. must get for any gamer who wants virtual 7.1 surround sound!
B0056FMNYA|1.0|Belt is too wide to easily slide into buckle - what's wrong with an easy clip buckle?<br />Camera clips on OK, not great.<br />The part that goes down your leg is for quite long lenses and looks stupid (I mean really dumb) with a lens less than say, six inches long.  This should be adjustable, it should not have to be cut it down for shorter lenses.<br />For the price this should be MUCH better.  If it was $5 - $10 then you could by a couple and cut them to desired lengths.<br /><br />Highly not recommended
B00D8KNG4Q|5.0|Call it national pride or even a foolish heart but this native Tulsan downloaded their latest digital mastery and within 10 minutes I knew I had a winner. No longer did I buy a CD just to support our local boys but rather I purchased a quality soundtrack of really good music. The \\"bubblegum\\" is gone as is the \\"jazzy mix\\" from their previous offering. This time, the \\"River Rats\\" went back to doing what they do best and that is - PLAY MUSIC!<br /><br />With driving beats and even some upbeat tempos even in their slower melodies, the boys came out to \\"rock n roll\\" and show the music industry that they are talented and they will not \\"go along\\" with trends or snazzy producers but instead they remain true to their Tulsa roots and play to their rocker strengths. The baby voices might be gone but in their replacement is some of the sweetest harmony this side of the Arkansas river.<br /><br />No longer do I buy their music because they come from my home town; now I buy their music because they truly know how to \\"ROCK IT\\"...........<br /><br />-Krip<br /><br />@crippledshark_krip (twitter)
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have no complaints about this game. It was fun to play and I look forward the next adventure. Great graphics  and compelling map layout.
B008OM0EDO|1.0|This one is bad.  I enjoy his movies but this is just cheese and I could only muster a smile at a couple of lines in the movie..I have to admit, I can't make it to the end because it stinks so bad.
