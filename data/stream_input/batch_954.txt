B000ICXQHE|1.0|This movie was a WASTE of 2 hours.     Horrible plot.  Horrible music.  Horrible character development.  Horrible cinematography.  Horrible random pointless scenes.  Horrible beginning.  Horrible middle.  Horrible ending.  Horrible movie.    My favorite part about this film is writing this review.
B000ZECQ08|3.0|Is it just me or did anyone else miss the missing magic?  No moving staircases, no talking portraits, no movement in the newspaper pictures!  Those things really added to the magic of the stories.  Sadly, changing directors with every movie has totally messed up all the stories since The Prisoner of Azkaban!  I'm shocked that Ms. Rowling would let them trash the story lines so badly. Shame on you Ms. Rowling.
B00000J2KX|2.0|let's be honest.   jack nicholson's portrayal here is so completely over the top as to be comedic. not a good thing for what purports to be a horror film.  it's a shame, because the cinematography is good, as is the supporting cast.  poor stephen king has not been served well by the cinematic treatment of his films.  the only one worth a damn is \\"the dead zone.\\"  and, no, i'm not talking about the putrid television remake, but the original one starring christopher walken, an actor who is unrivaled when he's taking his acting and the project seriously.
0805047905|3.0|This book was a gift given to my daughter for Christmas. Although I love the fact that it teaches her colors and animals, I found it too long for her to \\"read\\". We get halfway through the book and then she looks away and not listen anymore. So I thought I'd only give this 3 stars. I maybe wrong because she is after all only 5 and a half months old.

0525421033|5.0|How does one adequately describe \\"If I Stay\\" - amazing does not cut it, beautiful is only part of it, unique does not do it justice -breathtaking is as close as I could come (it took my breath away on several occasions). If I Stay is the kind of book that leaves you crying buckets, it's beautifully crafted, with prose that pull you off your feet, leave you begging Mia to make the right decision for her, but what could that possible be? If I were in the situation, I am not sure I could be as strong as she is...<br /><br />It is an elegant, sad, beautiful, amazing, stressful, and just beyond anything I have ever read, kind of book. The feelings I had while reading it, were/are so raw...I found myself in Mia's situation, heck I found myself putting myself in her situation with my life, around my own demons...this book had me thinking, REALLY thinking about life, \\"I realize now that dying is easy. Living is hard.\\" This words touched a cord so real with me...(As I said I have my own personal demons, and have struggled with depression most of my life, so I can get that sometimes dying seems easy...way easier than what living can sometimes offer.)<br /><br />Gayle Forman is one strong woman to be able to write this story - to tell the tail of Mia and Alex, along with their family and friends. To dive into those raw emotions, and bring out something so beautiful...I just can't describe how this book made me feel.<br /><br />I can't even offer a synopsis other than the one via goodreads - again, there's no way I could do it justice, or without huge spoilers that, if you want to find out you just must read the book. As such, I apologize, this review is not at all like like the \\"norm.\\" I wish I could offer you more, do this amazing book more justice, I just can't...<br /><br />If I Stay is a tear jerker - I cried off and on though most of it, it's an intense ride - with amazing characters, and words that fly off the pages and straight into your heart...it's a book that I will be recommending over and over again! One that, I will never forget reading!<br /><br />If you have not picked it up, If I Stay is one you SHOULD! I give it a 5++ stars! It's just breathtaking!ain! One that, I will never forget reading!    If you have not picked it up, If I Stay is one you SHOULD! I give it a 5++ stars! It's just breathtaking!

0802798225|5.0|Have you ever seen/read West Side Story? Perfect Chemistry reminded me in several ways of Grease, only in a more modern, unique way. Basically it is a classic love story, with a seemingly perfect \\"good girl\\" and the rough, rugged gangster \\"bad boy.\\"<br /><br />One of my favorite things about Simone Elkeles is the way she writes her characters Perfect Chemistry is no different - this book (along with the other's I have read written by Simone) is written in the alternating perspective's of Brittney and Alex, as such, I felt like I really knew each of them, their struggles as well as their loves...when they struggled I felt as though I was struggling, when they made a bad decision, or at least one that felt wrong, I got upset! I could sympathize with them, love with them and laugh with them.<br /><br />Brittney, like I said \\"looks\\" perfect from the outside - she's got a façade going and everyone is convinced, Brittney's life IS in fact perfect. She looks perfect, acts perfect, gets good grades; she's even dating the captain of the football team. However, inside Brittney is not so perfect (who is) - she's struggling to keep up the façade but...it's crumbling and when she becomes Chemistry partners with Alex Fuentes, she is just SURE he's going to prevent her from getting a good grade in the class - and her mother's going to blame HER - again!<br /><br />Alex is keeping a façade of his own, that of the rough, bad boy who no one can touch. He after all he IS a Latino gangster from the \\"wrong side of the tracks.\\" No one knows what he wants out of his life, since he has no choice, what does it even matter. Alex's father dies suddenly when he's only 6 - it's then up to Alex to protect this family, the only way he knows how! Being partnered with the uptight, \\"perfect\\" Brittney is NOT in his plans...<br /><br />As the two are drawn more and more together...they find their defenses going down, soon finding it impossible to deny the obvious attraction they are feeling for one another...however, being together is complicated, and could very well be dangerous for them both. Are they willing to risk their reputations, their families and maybe even their lives for a chance at being together?<br /><br />Perfect Chemistry is a griping tale of love, finding yourself, and learning to trust not only yourself but those you love. Beautifully written, with unique characters, which made the story for me, the way Simone writes makes you almost forget you're reading a book, she draws you into the story in such a way you begin to believe your right there, watching the story unfold.<br /><br />I found myself never wanting to put Perfect Chemistry down (much like I was with Leaving Paradise), but not wanting to read it so fast, because I was not ready for it to be over. Simone is my new favorite author, I can NOT wait to pick up another book written by her...she just has a unique \\"real\\" way of telling a story...allowing you to \\"feel\\" what's going on, creating real, unique characters in a very normal everyday setting.<br /><br />I give Perfect Chemistry 5 stars - and cannot wait to read the next installment Rules of Attraction, which is about Alex's little brother Carlos - it looks like an amazing read!er is complicated, and could very well be dangerous for them both.

1416594787|5.0|Dawkins' evidence for evolution is all around us:  if we would just bother to look, evolution is happening in every island-like habitat as we speak, just as it has been happening since the dawn of life.  I have two problems with this otherwise excellent effort:  Dawkins clearly thinks his readers are a bunch of yahoos and keeps urging us to \\"get a good nap\\" before starting what he thinks might be a \\"challenging\\" part of the book so we aren't too frustrated at not understanding him.  And the end of the book blames Americans for being especially stupid about basic science, citing multiple polls where we evidence how uninformed we are.  I suggest to Dawkins that he lay the blame where it should squarely fall:  on the scientists and educators and museum curators in the United States, not on the victims of our educational system.  Why did my child's 4th grade teacher refuse to mention the word \\"evolution\\" to the class because it is \\"too controversial\\"?  Why were the only museum exhibits I have ever seen on evolution put on in Britain and Canada, not here?  Why don't scientists come down out of their ivory tower and force boards of education to teach evolution starting in elementary school?  These are the questions he should be asking but it's easier to blame the yokels.
0545123267|4.0|Overall, I really liked this book. The beautiful, sad, poetic way in which it was written, the romance and dangers... BUT, there are few specific things I didn't like... #1 There were many times, during action scenes in particular, where I really wished the author had added more details of what the character was seeing. (Although, she could've just been wanting to leave it up to our imagination to fill in the blanks?) #2 I wanted more of the wolves. Of what it was like to be in the pack, etc. I felt that aspect of the story was somewhat lacking. #3 There were a few times in the story where things weren't explained well. I kept asking myself \\"Wait, why is this part important to the story?\\" I think I wanted more depth, more explanation and details; more background information on how everything started.  On the plus side, I thought the book was a very enjoyable easy read (Not a 500 page novel, but also not a tiny 100+ page short story that's over too fast, but just right). The characters were very interesting and each unique in personality. And the book definitely kept me turning pages to keep reading, even into the wee hours of the night. I would recommend this book to anyone who enjoys a romance with a supernatural twist to it. I'm really looking forward to reading the sequel, Linger. Maybe the author will dive more into the real details of this fascinating story in the next book. I hope so.

B002VPE1AM|5.0|At this point, a mere two weeks into Avatar's premier run in the theatres, it's trite to say that the filmaking is revolutionary.  Cameron establishes himeslf as the master filmaker of our generation, surpassing Spielberg, I think, for the history books.  Avatar is a magnificent work of the imagination, magnificent in that the makers were able to transfer the vision into the media. Putting the 3-D specs on really brings ya back half a century - though Real 3-D is a technological advance with Real potential - and the feeling is ironically apt - from the \\"Dances with Wolves\\" perspective of the story. Unequivocally, my favorite part of the film (and I love blues and greens and fine romance) is the critique of the basic ignorant, violent, imperialist, ethnocentric, exploitive, cruel, arrogant, and jarheadly stupid foreign and environmental policy which has characterized the American pursuit of privilege and exceptionalism - from the four plus century old genocide of the Native American to the present misguided insanity (given a good shot in the arm by the 1947 establishment of the Dept of Defense) which some have the temerity to call \\"conservative\\" foreign policy. As the heart of the movie-going audience is aged 8-18, Cameron couldn't have guided his arrow any better, despite evident glitches along the periphery of the storyline.  A great film - and I hope - no, pray - that people FINALLY get the POINT!!!

B000001ESN|5.0|On this date 30 years ago, Canadian prog-rock trio Rush released their seventh studio album, delivering perhaps their most commercial set of songs at the time while simultaneously helping to usher in a new era of music. \\"Permanent Waves\\" is that album, and its effects can be felt just as strongly today.<br /><br />Opening with the arena-rock ode to music, \\"The Spirit of Radio,\\" this six-song set injects not only a strong song-writing sensibility, but also tighter musicianship as well as top-notch production. In fact, it's one of the few rock albums from its era that still sounds fresh and lively long after its heyday has passed. Whether it's Geddy Lee's vibrant vocals and expressive bass-lines, guitarist Alex Lifeson's precise riffing or drummer Neil Peart's infallibility behind the drums, everything that served to define the band before is in full effect on this effort, only streamlined to express something entirely different.<br /><br />Granted, \\"Permanent Waves\\" does find the band scaling back its grand approach to song-writing and song-structures, but everlasting hits like \\"Freewill\\" and the aforementioned \\"Spirit of Radio\\" are just as bold and hard-hitting as anything else in their back catalogue. \\"Entre Nous\\" is a slightly less-recognized cut, but is yet another example of the band's shift from prog-rock heroes to stadium rock Gods. Never fear, though, as \\"Jacob's Ladder\\" and the album's nearly 10-minute long closer, \\"Natural Science\\" show a more experimental and traditional side of the album while simultaneously complimenting the hits on hand perfectly.<br /><br />Although it's admittedly more radio-friendly and commercial than the band's previous efforts, it holds up us one of Rush's most consistent and powerful records to date.  To be honest, there is not a single flaw to be found, and the songs breeze by so fast, you'll feel compelled to start the album all over again just as soon as it finishes. \\"Permanent Waves\\" is a rock album that transcends genres from a band that has never been afraid of taking risks. One of the best in the band's career, as well as one of the best albums the 80's had to offer.been afraid of taking risks.

0061914177|5.0|This is a great primer on branding and the social media. The book does not get into technical details of social media tools like Facebook but identifies important ones to learn about. It approaches their use in building brands and businesses and organizations. The power of social media to make or break a business or any organization is illustrated with examples. Gary lives the results.     The book recognizes different DNA's and how your DNA best fits in branding yourself with social media. There is an action plan at the end of the book that is easy to follow. Carrying it out to use social media to your advantage is work. But if the passion for what you do is there, then you will find it worth it.     The book is a easy read. The chapters are short allowing for breaks.     If you own a business, even medical practice, legal practice, you need to explore the use of social media to compete and survive and grow. The idea of a web page and home page is quickly fading from prominence. Building a following, enabling your customers and patients to share and contribute is what this is all about. You cannot avoid it, so you need to embrace it.     I applied this book to an article I wrote on current political activist movements at NJCommonSense blog and how politicians are embracing social media. Many politicians are going to have to run from social media because of who they are (not ready for social media exposure)and the new politicians will replace them in a more open and interactive world of social media with elected officials which is good news.
030014332X|4.0|The book was written around 1930 for European schoolchildren and is oriented toward Western Europe, but that shouldn't stop any American child or adult from reading it now.  Gombrich hits the historical highlights in a fair and balanced way, just as he does in The Story of Art.  As with that book, every reader will wish Gombrich had included or expanded upon some events that he leaves out or mentions offhand, but that's the nature of historical surveys.  Gombrich's style is simple but not at all condescending, and his humor is dry.<br /><br />The book cuts off at about 1930, more or less when Gombrich wrote it.  But this edition adds an appendix with Gombrich's remarks on subsequent events, such as WWII.  The introduction, written by a granddaughter, says that some chapters, especially those having to do with the Far East, as I recall, were reworked and corrected for this edition.  So this edition is a sort of weird hybrid between a reprint and a rewrite of the original.  It would have been more effective either to have reprinted (after translation into English) the original, and then perhaps to have added an appendix with all of the extra material and corrections that Gombrich wanted, or to have incorporated all of the corrections and additions into the original chapters, thus obviating the desire for the appendix.  But that's a minor gripe.

B002BSHXJA|5.0|I have found that neither mono or stereo is actually better than the other, all that matters is the opinion and preference of the listener.  After testing both versions, I have found that my listening enjoyment depends on whether I listen through headphones or speakers.            If you are listening through speakers (not headphones), the stereo versions sound fine. If your speakers are close together, it sounds sort of like mono anyway, but with more clarity.  But when I listen to the stereo versions through headphones, the voices- right, instruments-left separation is really annoying to the ears, especially on Please Please Me, With the Beatles, and Rubber Soul.  I prefer a more balanced stereo separation.  These albums (to me) are better in mono through headphones.           I don't really like to listen to the mono versions through two speakers.  Mono was designed for one speaker, playing it through two speakers makes it sound muddy to me, so I cut one speaker off.  I like to listen to the mono versions in headphones because it has more impact and equal sound in both ears.         Certain songs sound better in mono to me, especially the earlier songs.  Paperback Writer, Day Tripper, We Can Work It Out and Revolution are some of the best examples of songs that sound best in mono to me.  It has a more raw sound that captures a more cohesive sound of the band as if they were on stage.  Mono usually works best on the more heavier, rockier songs; it gives the music more PUNCH.       Again it all depends on the listener.  I like both versions of the Beatles catalogue. The mono version is great for completists and hardcore purists. For the more casual fan who listens mostly through speakers, I suppose the stereo is just as well.

B002VT6C0K|1.0|What a weird title for a collection of depressingly macabre stories. Sure, the writing's skillful - she can draw you in - but then each story ends abruptly, without any semblance of denouement.
B002VPE1AM|2.0|If you've read any of the reviews of Avatar, one thing you keep hearing is that this is essentially Kevin Costner's [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]] mixed with James Cameron's [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]]. The plot is almost an exact replica of [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]], with the disillusioned marine joining the alien natives and fighting against the white occupiers. Only in this version, the natives are blue-skinned aliens rather than Lakota and the occupiers are space marines along the lines of the troops in [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] rather than Col. Custer's cavalry. Since I love both of these movies, and being something of a sci-fi geek, I had high hopes for Avatar. However, I found myself somewhat disappointed.    First the good. The special effects were indeed impressive. The aliens, the Navi, really do look realistic, even when next to live actors. I generally thought the computer-generated plants and animals looked like real living organisms rather than cartoonish creations. The planet where all the action takes place, Pandora, is beautiful. Cameron's concept design and art departments must have had a lot of fun. I love the bioluminescent plants that glow at night. Even though I wasn't crazy about Avatar the movie, I would definitely want to take an eco-tourism vacation to Pandora and learn more about the wildlife.    Now, the disappointments. Avatar's plot is just too unoriginal, too cliche. I'm not accusing Cameron of copying any particular movie. Obviously, the concept of the \\"noble savage\\" have been around for a while (at least since de Montainge utilizes it during the late 1500s). However, Avatar just bears too strong a resemblance to too many other movies, from [[ASIN:B000A9QK78 FernGully: The Last Rainforest]] to [[ASIN:B000J0UD94 1492: Conquest of Paradise]]. However, Cameron's embellishments to these prior plots are only skin-deep - literally. Despite living light years away on another world, the Navi are almost identical to Western stereotypes of the Noble Savage among Native American tribes: from the braided hair to communicating with animals to the communal/egalitarian society to the use of bows and arrows. At least design some other weapon besides bows and arrows (a boomerang might have been a neat idea for a primitive weapon)!     Second, I felt the special effects really overwhelmed the movie. Of course, as mentioned above, the special effects were very impressive - but that's not enough to make a good movie. Too many times, it seems like somebody in the art department had a bunch of crazy ideas and nobody really bothered to ask whether they would advance the plot. For example, the movie features floating mountains. Really? I'm willing to suspend my disbelief (after all, I was willing to accept the Force in the [[ASIN:B001EN71DG Star Wars Trilogy]]), but I don't get why the movie really needed floating mountains as opposed to really tall ones. (incidentally, if you want to see a really interesting an original idea of what an alien planet might actually look like, check out the documentary [[ASIN:B002C39T2I Alien Planet]]).     Finally, the villains of the movie, the human occupiers, were generally two-dimensional characters (despite the 3-D glasses I was wearing). They were simply greedy corporate raiders and mercenaries - something we've seen dozens of times before. Almost no internal conflict, no remorse whatsoever (only the \\"good guys\\" are allowed to feel remorse). This is the type of movie when you really enjoy seeing the \\"bad guys\\" getting beaten at the end - they really do deserve it. However, there are no memorable \\"bad guys\\" in Avatar who rise to the level of a Darth Vader or Gollum or Khan ([[ASIN:B002I9Z8B2 Star Trek II:  The Wrath of Khan]]) or even a Lord Voldemort ([[ASIN:B002PMV9FG Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince]]). This is important, because I think one of the things that separates good fantasy/sci-fi from great is the presence of a deep, complex villain.    So, did Avatar live up to the hype? Unfortunately, I don't think so. Don't, get me wrong - it's a good movie and decent entertainment, certainly worth renting when it comes out on DVD. The moral of not conquering other peoples and respecting the environment are worthy. I just don't think that, 10 years from now, we'll be raving about this movie the same way fans still obsessively watch The Lord of the Rings or Star Wars. There's no spark of originality or really cool characters that make Avatar worth watching again - much less make it last for decades.
0316044695|3.0|I admire all those who serve and especially those who have willingly put themselves at the tip of the spear. It was a struggle to get past the first half of the book where Lattrell pumped his chest and goes on about how great the SEALS are and how hard BUDS was. I stuck it out to read about the mission and his survival story.  The second half is quite a compelling story of survival and the bond between soldiers in arms. That said, what bothered me was that this mission was a goat fork from the beginning.  The underlying problem with this mission is the fact that the military continues to misuse resources for the glory of the brass in each branch.  Every branch has to get in on the action regardless the fact that the SEALS aren't really the best unit for that mission. More than one story has been told where the SeALs were clearly out of their element in the mountains of Afghanistan.  Here are a few striking admissions that bother me.  No compass in his H-harness? No 550 cord to secure the goatherds, so they are cut loose to alert the Taliban of the unit's location?  The SEALS actually, seriously considered killing these civilians?<br /><br />It's sad 3/4 of this unit was lost on the mountainside along with the rescue team.  Things go wrong when the wrong units are used for the wrong task. I don't expect Lattrell or any of his brethren to accept that they weren't the right men for the job.  These men don't say no to a mission.  The problem is that WE expect their command staff to be smart enough to check their egos at the door and know when to say no so that the best trained units for the task are used.<br /><br />I think Mr. Lattrell and his team are great examples of our elite warriors.  I'm proud to have him and others like him out there fighting the fight against these terrorists. He's a great American and I'm glad to have read his story in his words.  He's a great model for our children.

The finale with Voldemort has the right poignancy to show that this isn't simply a battle of wands and spells, but rather the triumph of hope over evil. I look forward to seeing how Hooper interprets the future films.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|I've been listening to John Mayer since Room for Squares, and I love that each of his releases is different. I think it's the mark of an artist and musician to keep changing and exploring his sounds. I've been able to depend on JM to produce something in new territory that I'll still enjoy and appreciate just as much or even more. In general, I don't think Battle Studies has the instant charisma of Continuum, but it is more consistently listenable. The feel of Battle Studies is more relaxed and \\"70's.\\" I hear Fleetwood Mac in Half of My Heart, and the Beatles in Friends, Lovers or Nothing. Perfectly Lonely, War of My Life, and Edge of Desire also have retro vibes. My favorites from Battle Studies are Heartbreak Warfare, Half of My Heart, Who Says, Perfectly Lonely, Assassin, Crossroads, and Friends, Lovers or Nothing. There are no bad songs on this album. It is a more mature release, more genuine and without the feel that he has to prove anything. It's a great album all the way through.
B00020HEG6|5.0|This is easily the best Harry Potter soundtrack thus far. John Williams manages to capture a distinct and darker mood for the film. The themes for Lupen's talks with Harry and for Sirius are really touching. While the other soundtracks are OK, Azaban is actually memorable.
0375842209|5.0|This book is one of the best books I have read in months! I loved how the book talked about WWII and the struggles that faced everyone even German citizens.  I read this book in three days, I could not seem to put it down. It is a heartwarming and life changing novel that will make  you laugh and cry. I purchased and read the book while in Australia and it has been a huge hit there as well. I would recommend this book to anyone and I have.
0307266303|4.0|This is a good book about the the running of the Tarahumara people. It does not attempt to be an overview on their history or lives. The writer's informal style fits his \\"outsider in awe\\" status.

B0015POEV0|5.0|Hi Folks<br />Breaking Bad is one amazing show! The acting is wonderful, the casting inspired, but whoever writes this subtle nuanced layered story about a Chemistry teacher cooking meth, is brilliant.<br />The Chemistry teacher is told he has cancer and only a short time to live & so begins cooking meth to build a nestegg for his family.<br />It can be brutal, and at first I thought this would be a dark comedy. While it does have it's funny moments, this is a pretty serious drama. WELL DONE! It is one of my favorite shows!<br />Watch this series!
B0028RXXFC|5.0|This was a great Christmas present to my husband. We've been watching this since the day after Christmas and just finished all the discs yesterday. Enjoyed it more than most movies at the theater. Would buy the next series in a heart beat. Well worth the money and we can not stop talking about it.
B001AQTWF2|5.0|Wow! This CD has it all~ songs to dance to and songs to sing along with. But, my favorite song was a spiritual tune for sure! Her song, \\"I look to you\\" really spoke to me. I cried. Her beautiful voice and the fact that she is not ashamed to say, [sic] 'i needed help and it came from a higher power'  is awesome.  Throughout the entire cd you hear her story, see her fall and rise back up again. Life is not easy at times and each song has a message for us. I love the CD and wish her the best in everything. Glad she's back :)  [received for christmas from my amazon wishlist]
B002VKE1K2|1.0|If like 2 million people watch this movie, that's almost 3 million hours of life lost for nothing.   This movie was boring and I only wish I could have slept through it as well as the cast did.  The idea of recording on a hand held video camera is being done to death and let's be real...Does anyone have the presence of mind to have the video camera on 24 hours a day,7 days a week and grab it whenever a moment of crisis arises?  That got to be just plain silly.  Honestly, the acting wasn't too bad but what about that goofy professor?  Not his area of expertise?  Any researcher in his right mind would have been falling all over himself trying to get involved in this couple's problem, not saying something like: \\"Really, I think I'm doing more harm than good by being here\\" RealY?  And this guy is a paranormal researcher?   Finally, I'm going to mention the couple in bed.  They hardly ever moved during the night.  Yes, once in a while there was some slight motion in the bed bout for the most part you couldn't tell if they were even alive or not.  And the girl.  Did she just go to bed every night in the shorts and tee shirt she was wearing that day?  Did she own a pair of shoes?  She was a student...Did she ever go to class or maybe study?  Sigh.  Enough.  Save yourself.  Skip this mess.  The ending was not worth the wait.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|I must have been a good mommy this year as I got this cd that was on my wishlist!  Michael's voice is so sweet; he is a crooner and for me, it works. I love his choices and there is a really good \\"love song\\" or two on there as well that just made me feel, well, in love!
B002T9H2LK|4.0|I am a big QT fan without a doubt. I have seen all of his movies minus Death Proof. I awaited his \\"war movie\\" ever since I read on his website about his desire to make one.   Today I got to watch Inglorious Basterds for the first time and while It had me on the edge of my seat the entire time, I thought to myself that some of the music and things that made Kill Bill original just came off as a redundant carbon copy and annoying this time around. If he wants to use a particular technique in his films, be it a visual theme, or a certian hybridization of his favorite genres, that is a wonderful thing. But to recycle these unique tricks in a second movie makes it seem like he is either really out of ideas, or so full of himself that you think we will love to see these tricks over and over again.   It irritates me a bit to see a period movie with music in it that is not from that period (ex: \\"A Nights Tale\\"). While I believe that music can be done effectively, I think that we as the audience get the point that he loves to mix the 70's blaxploitation and the spaghetti western. I think it would be a unique departure for QT to leave his trademark style behind and do a movie without the tricks and gadgets. These types of techniques will make me cringe eventually, instead of making me look forward to another Tarantino release.   In this movie we have the Gore of \\"Dogs\\" with some of the exact same music, intertitles, and comic book charachter reveals from Kill Bill.  As a QT movie, he hasn't necessarily added any new recipes to his menu.  It is almost as if he has read too many reviews from people who aren't otherwise capable of following his non linear continuity, so he \\"dumbed\\" his style down with Chapter Intertitles.   I would like to see QT also leave his fetishes in the bedroom for once. Im not dissing the foot fetish, but putting it in every single movie is getting on my nerves. There are a billion other things worth capturing on celluloid than the different types of foot coverings and positions a lady's toes might find themselves in. Gimme a freakin break! \\"Okay in this scene your foot will be dressed in distress, though still in a 40's pump fashion, okay? We still need a closeup on the dolled up foot, so lets see some plantar flexion in 5...4..3..okay...\\"    I also have to say that Id like to see a QT movie that doesn't have Samuel L Jackson or Harvey Keitel anywhere in it. We get it, he likes his troupe, but it is little things like this that made me roll my eyes during this particular piece that kept me from giving it 5 stars. Im through complaining now, perhaps.    I gave this movie a review, because if moved me to do so. I don't normally review things, but this is an exception. The actors in this movie were great, and aside from the reasons listed above of why this movie isn't an A+, everything else in this movie was Best Picture calibre. The nazi bullying was intense, and even though none of the antagonists in the film were creepy, their sense of evil comes at you from the other charachters. This was simply brilliant.    It is worth watching, but my overall opinion is now QT needs to retire all of his old tricks, leave some of his old standby actors behind, and really reinvent himself.  This will be of prime importance in my opinion if Tarantino is to be remembered as one of the Great directors of this century.     I still love his work, I still will look forward to his films, but if I watch another movie of his with the same tricks from Kill Bill, I will puke on my bootlegged DVD copy of it.
B002RVZV9U|3.0|I enjoyed this documentary from a historical perspective.  It was fun to see Jimmy Page as an old man reminiscing.  But I was hoping for more music, especially the LOUD kind given the title.  But there is very little actual playing, except for brief stints that are always cut off for more talking.  Talk, talk, talk.  I wanted to hear these guys play at least a few full uninterrupted songs.  Didn't happen.  Disappointing.
0061020710|5.0|Rincewind, perhaps the worst wizard of all time, whose cowardice is so great that it might turn out to be bravery and heroism, finds himself employed by enthusiastic tourist Twoflower due to being threatened by Twoflower's super-powered luggage. Wacky adventures across the magical realm of Discworld, involving game-playing gods, Death, dragon riders, the most heinous creature of all time, dull-witted heroes, and a demon-powered camera ensue. All in a refracted mirror of our world, where magic is common, troublesome, and dull. Pratchett's prose, characters, and imagination rival that of the comic genius of Douglas Adams. It is a book to be savored while simultaneously being devoured. Also, anyone within earshot will wonder why you're laughing. Fantastic, juicy book. Absolute candy. Grade: A+
B0011N1WE8|5.0|This is one of the cutest, most refreshing films I've seen in a long time; I only wish I'd seen it sooner!  Fabulous cast, great acting, and fresh air breathed into the age-old story of not judging a book by its cover.  Brought to us by the adorable Reese Witherspoon, who makes a fun, off-beat appearance late in the film, this is an entertaining exploration into the shallowness of vanity and the depths of love, which makes you laugh, think, and feel good when it's finished.
0786838655|5.0|When I find a good series the first thing I do is see how many books are in it so I know I won't have to wait 4 months for another to come out. The Lighting Thief is a long exciting series that has a nice plot and surprises you all the time. Just about any audience would enjoy reading this book. It's based on the Greek myths and legends and turns every would-be-scary monster in them into something fun and hilarious. The humor in this is great and I recommend it for anyone. I had one of my friends read it and she's still snapping up the rest of the series. I'm 11 years old and I loved it, so if you're looking for a book for a daughter or son or nephew or niece or a person in the age group of 1-90 this is a truly superb book.

For example, if you are looking for insights into recent cases, \\"Palmer\\" provides up to date commentary encompassing amendments to the Act, including new legislation and developments throughout its implementation, notably the implementation of the Shareholders' Rights Directive as a particular highlight.<br /><br />Each section of the Act is reproduced followed by insightful commentary. There are of course references to new, relevant case law and cross references to applicable secondary legislation.  The various forms of Model Articles of Association as at 1st October 2009 are reproduced and the statutory context of the Act is explained in tables setting out surviving provisions of previous companies legislation, destinations and derivations.<br /><br />This is a formidable work even in flimsy paperback which is bound detach a few pages of the first 1154 covering the Act! It is well structured for the 47 parts covering areas too numerous to note in detail for a short review but everything is here.  Suffice to say, the contents range from company formation, constitution and articles of association, to company name, directors liabilities and audit, to offences under the companies acts and transparency obligations.<br /><br />There are six appendices covering the last 400 pages, deal with --  and we list them here -- Bankruptcy and Diligence etc. (Scotland) Act 2007...Surviving Provisions...Table of Derivations...Table of Destinations...Table of Statutory Instruments and Companies (Model Articles) Regulations 2008.<br /><br />No commercial law practitioner or academic should be without the weight of authority, thoroughness and reliability offered by this latest edition of \\"Palmer\\" with its invaluable `General Note' on almost every page as a guide of excellence for all.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-0-414-04087-8pages of the first 1154 covering the Act!

1847037542|5.0|THE 19th EDITION IS A FITTING TRIBUTE TO 21st CENTURY DUTIES & RESPONSIBILITIES OF MODERN CORPORATE & PERSONAL INSOLVENCY<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />As the current authors somewhat ruefully point out, recent economic conditions have generated a new interest in insolvency and bankruptcy scholarship, with judicial and legislative developments in this area of law accelerating at an unprecedented rate.<br /><br />It's particularly relevant now since the publication in 2005 of the previous edition of \\"Kerr & Hunter on Receivers and Administrators\\" which was Muir Hunter's last contribution to this area of law, and he is much missed. The latest edition of this venerable and authoritative work first published in 1869 under the editorship of W W Kerr  therefore focuses well nigh exclusively on bringing it as up to date as much as possible as at 31 October 2009 in 800 pages and 31 chapters.<br /><br />Following the death of the distinguished Muir Hunter QC, the stated aim of the authors has been not only to maintain his tradition of meticulous scholarship, but to provide 'an insight into the practical and strategic issues which have already arisen and no doubt will continue to arise in this area'. They succeed, and he would be pleased with the result which maintains his pace.<br /><br />New material includes:<br /><br />* the developments of the UNCITRAL Model system in both the EU and US<br /><br />* the latest rulings and case study material on cross border insolvency in respect of EU regulations<br /><br />* the rulings of the Spectrum case and their implications<br /><br />* illustrative material on potential judicial conflicts pertaining to administration<br /><br />* the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002, including the abolition of the Assets Recovery Agency and transfer of its main civil recovery functions to the Serious Organised Crime Agency<br /><br />* developments relating to the `prescribed part' for the unsecured creditors in receivership and administration<br /><br />There's also a full exposition in Part VI of receivership in Scotland and coverage of the highly important area of taxation of receivers and administrators. There are detailed footnotes and index and copious tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and civil procedure rules.<br /><br />If you deal in any way with matters relating insolvency and bankruptcy, whether you are a practitioner or academic, the nineteenth \\"Keir and Hunter\\" is now widely regarded as the definitive and certainly indispensable work of reference for 21st century insolvency law for receivers and administrators- Muir Hunter's pace has been well maintained.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-847-03754-1o a full exposition in Part VI of receivership in Scotland and coverage of the highly important area of taxation of receivers and administrators.

1847036104|5.0|TO GUIDE YOU THROUGH THE COMPLEXITIES OF COMMERCIAL AGREEMENTS!<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />When your day to day workload involves the drafting and negotiation of legal documents governing the business relationships of your clients, the new 2009 edition of Richard Christou's \\"Drafting Commercial Agreements\\" will function superbly as your practical guide and mentor to go with his other definitive work \\"Sale and Supply of Goods and Services\\" which we reviewed when we met him two years ago.<br /><br />Retaining the same scope and purpose as previous editions of `Christou on Drafting', the fourth edition, five years after the last one, aims to continue to provide all the essential precedents in one volume. It's accompanied by the necessary legal commentary and explanation in 18 chapters, divided in four parts, covering virtually every commercial and business relationship you are likely to encounter within your practice.<br /><br />Since the last edition was published in 2004, it has been completely updated to include the latest developments in statute and case law; for example exclusion and limitation clauses in both consumer and business to business relationships.  Also noteworthy is that the new volume also incorporates changes in employment law over the intervening years - including pensions and transfer of undertakings.<br /><br />This is a scholarly, reliable and logically structured resource ably written by Richard and assisted by Robert Crossley, both of whom are experts in this field of law. The work covers, both extensively and intensively, four basic areas: the supply of goods and services...agency and distribution...mergers and acquisitions...and other commercial agreements, including joint ventures, confidentiality agreements, employment contracts, teaming agreements, securities for debts, dispute resolution and settlement... and technology licensing agreements.<br /><br />All recent legislation and case law is incorporated into the precedents and commentary -- and reference is made to EU legislation and decisions by the Commission.  Do note that when you need to come to grips with that quaintly titled Unfair Contract Terms Act (UCTA), highly experienced solicitor that he is, Richard Christou provides the definitive explication and analysis of the Act under virtually every category, from test of reasonableness to EC law considerations.<br /><br />In this the definitive work of reference on the subject of commercial agreements, you'll find copious Tables of Statutes, Statutory Instruments, Cases and European Community Legislation therein.<br /><br />There is a most useful accompanying CD which will save much time, and comes with a helpline link containing data files of the clauses in this almost 800 page volume- but it is not as heavy as it looks! The law is generally stated as at September 2009 and remains an excellent guide through the complexities of drafting your commercial agreements as used and accepted in modern practice.<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-847-03610-0ted into the precedents and commentary -- and reference is made to EU legislation and decisions by the Commission.

0385504225|3.0|Yes, this review is on \\"The Lost Symbol\\", but I need to begin with \\"Angels and Demons\\" (contrary to what one reviewer in this section wrote, it was written before \\"The Davinci Code\\"). A good solid novel it was. I liked Langdon right off. If I don't like the main character, I can't stay interested. It's a weakness of mine I suppose, but I have to care about the hero.<br />  I had to skip reading \\"The Davinci Code\\" when I quickly discovered that Brown claimed doggedly that certain foundational elements of the story were fact, when they were not. \\"I can't read this!\\" I exclaimed to my wife of 50 years. \\"I love fiction, but don't try to fool me with nonsense about something as serious as Christianity's path to the present.\\" I dropped the book with a thud on the coffee table. She picked it up, read it, and said it was a \\"triumph\\" of story telling, even if it was based on bunk.<br />  That brings me to \\"The Lost Symbol\\". I wish it had stayed lost. Langdon was still there, and I was still rooting for him, but the story was muddy, full of confusing aspects, and I couldn't make myself care enough to give it a good mark. Therefore can't give it more than 3 stars (which means \\"okay\\", I gather) only because of my high expectations.<br />Jess Duboy, author: Wings of Forever.
1847036112|5.0|THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE WORK ON COMPUTER CONTRACTS<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />If there are any dinosaurs and/or young/old fogeys out there who still need reminding that computers are not referred as `new technology' anymore, they should  note the fact that the publishers of the 8th edition of \\"Morgan & Burden on Computer Contracts\\" now refer to it as a `classic text'- quite right, too.<br /><br />It reminds us that as we are now into the second decade of the 21st century, and computer technology - basically the desktop and laptop kind, (not those room-sized great big ones now in museums) - has been part of the workplace for at least 30 years, more or less.<br /><br />A whole new generation now grown up doesn't even think of computer technology or IT as particularly `new'.  Conscious of this attitudinal shift, Richard Morgan and Kit Burden admit in their preface that:<br /><br /> `one might make a good case for dropping such a term (as `computer contract') in favour of a more generic reference to \\"information technology\\"', although rather obviously they add, `we have elected not to do so!'<br /><br />Well, we see their point.  After all, this is a classic text with a now, well established title, so why change it?<br /><br />While this is not a book on the law of contract as such, the authors have borne in mind the needs of the company secretary, the procurement professional, or legal adviser suddenly faced with a computer contract and then asked for comment or advice.<br /><br />If you occupy any of these categories or similar, this 800 page book in 20 chapters will help you identify and understand the main types of computer contract and the provisions you are likely to expect in each.  If you are a lawyer charged with drafting a contract, note the extensive set of precedents at the back which emerge as one of the book's outstanding features.<br /><br />The work amply fulfills its stated twofold purpose: `to illuminate the technology-specific content of agreements ... and to provide useful precedents'. And, thankfully, not too many cases!<br /><br />To help you stay ahead in a rapidly changing environment, Morgan & Burden offers a wealth of new material, including:<br /><br />* A new section of procurement procedure covering both the public and private sectors<br /><br />* Detailed coverage of Open Source software<br /><br />* Web 2.0 contracts such as those for social networking<br /><br />* Precedents for home working staff, whether using their own or their company's equipment<br /><br />* An expanded Appendix on Sources of Advice, including the Office of the Information Commissioner and other relevant bodies.<br /><br />With extensive tables of cases, statutes, statutory instruments and European Legislation, this invaluable and authoritative legal text is, in addition to all its other merits, an excellent drafting tool for the busy practitioner with all the modern conveniences.<br /><br />So, do use this additional and expected time-saving convenience (necessity) of an accompanying CD which it really ought to have to remain the definitive work on computer contracts... as it does!<br /><br />ISBN: 978-1-84703-611-7nt of agreements ... and to provide useful precedents'.

0439023483|5.0|The \\"Hunger Games\\" is a great read full of suspense, intriguing characters, action and a little bit of romance.  The narrative is built for the reality T.V. generation with influences ranging from \\"Battle Royale\\" and \\"1984\\" to \\"Lord of the Flies\\".  It all revolves Katniss Everdeen, who elects to enter the Hunger Games, a 24-man enter 1-man leaves type tournament.  It can be incredibly brutal at times, but Collins justifies the violence in every scene.  Essentially 23 kids (aged 11-18) are going to be killed in order for a winner to be crowned, but while death is a major factor, the moral dilemmas the characters face is much more powerful in the end.  If you're a fan of tight, thrilling action but also enjoy interesting, engaging characters, \\"The Hunger Games\\" is the perfect read for you.
B001BC5HXG|5.0|One of my top 10 books. It has all the good stuff and brings out a range of emotions.
0385736002|2.0|The concept for this story drew me in.  The characters and execution of the plot drove me away.  I decided to finally stop reading after about 2/3 of the way through (I should have stopped earlier).  What struck me most was the character of Josh - one of the modern-day twins who are the focal point of the story.  His reactions to events surrounding him, particularly his trust issues with Nicholas Flamel, fall completely flat and come across as entirely artificial.  There's nothing that we learn about Josh to lead us to understand why he responds differently.  As others have mentioned, he and his sister Sophie are strongly stereotyped teenagers with little depth to speak of.  The most we ever learn about them is that their absent parents are archaeologists... as if this will explain every detail about why they're able to adapt to the magical events unfolding around them.  It's ludicrous.<br /><br />What's almost more silly is all the talk I've read in the reviews about this work filling in as a fitting successor to Harry Potter.  Please.  This work doesn't earn the author the right to spit-polish J.K. Rowling's shoes.  Harry Potter starts with a wonderful concept, but is really about the evocative three-dimensional characters.  There's NONE of that in the Alchemist.  Unless you're under 15 and have an imagination that's able to gloss over or ignore the weaknesses in the writing, skip this one and be thankful you did.

0786860707|5.0|I bought Walt Stanchfield's \\"drawn to life\\" books earlier in 2009, and They were good, but after reading this I appreciated Stanchfield's books so much more and understood the idea behind the \\"magic of Disney\\" so much better. After just the first 50 pages of this HUGE book you see what made Disney so special, and how involved Walt truly was in the process, and bringing his dream to 'life'. Your also introduced to some of the special animators that came through Disney's doors, and even down to personal 'gags' they pulled on each other.    It may not be a how-to book, but whether you want to get involved in animation one day, or just enjoy the history behind it/info about, I can't imagine you NOT reading this book. There are parts of it they are how-to, persay. the realization of squash and stretch, and that they have to make their characters think and have 'weight'.

0743298039|5.0|Oh, I wish I was reading this for the first time again. I loved every second of this book. From the very first line to the last, I ate every word of this book. This may be my favorite book ever. (But I say that often). I reread Jane Eyre after I finished it. This book is a love story to literature. It is a love story to the smell and feel of a book. This is a booklover's dream. Read it, and then read it aloud, you'll love the sound of the words. This is a all five senses thrill.

B002C1BHIO|1.0|It's funny how Amazon is selling their own branded HDMI cable on their site since they also sell perfectly good $0.11 HDMI cables which deliver the SAME picture and sound quality at a fraction of the price. Anyone who pays more than $5 for an HDMI cable shorter than 12 feet is simply getting ripped off.<br />Don't get me wrong there is nothing wrong with this cable other than the price. The nylon exterior is a nice stylish touch and the gold connectors ensure good signal transfer. It has the same 1080p video and surround sound output capability as every other HDMI 1.3 standard cable. With HDMI you either get the signal or nothing at all. There is no need for any Monster Cable gimmickery anymore since HDMI is all digital, unlike analog cable types like Composite, Component A/V (RGB) or S-Video. Only buy a HDMI cable like this if you hate money and believe in the 'Chivas Regal Effect'...
0061537969|5.0|My wife talked me into reading this book.  At first I was very skeptical and figured I wouldn't enjoy it, but after the first couple of chapters I was hooked and had to finish it.  The only thing I might change about this book is the significant amount of racing references.  I am not a big race fan or anything so I didn't really get a lot out of them, but I still enjoyed the book.      I would recommend this to anyone that is looking for their next great book to read.  Dog lover or not!    Thanks Garth Stein for the great story!
0756655730|5.0|This is one of the most beautiful,informative and spectacular books on Natural History ever made. It deals with everything from the origins of life in the sea to the evolution of man. I am fascinated with the subject. I am especially fascinated with the Natural History of Dinosaurs and yes the book does go into the history but it also takes you back to their origins. Mammals, Insects, Aquatic animals. Just about everything you need to read about the ancient Earth is here. This book is worth alot more than I paid for. Anyone interested in The Natural History of Life On Earth NEEDS to get this book!

I have four kids and none has ever been particularly interested in this book even given my attempts to engage them with the story and the pictures.  Each has had his/her own favorite book and it has never been this one.  I should look at a bigger one, maybe that's the ticket.

By that I mean this movie cost like $6000 dollars to make and it scared the crap out of me. It is shot using home video cameras and it makes it feel so real. If it didnt have the warning at the end I could of believed it. It also has several endings and this DVD has 2 of those. If you like to watch scary movies this will become a classic. Oh and all the scary stuff happens at night or when they arent paying any attention.
B002K0WBY6|5.0|This movie was just what I needed to start the New Year fresh with my husband of 10 years who I married to stay in America once we graduated out of college in 2000. Not to mention I've lived in Alaska since 1996 and have a great career as a businesswoman. Yes, I can be \\"a witch on the broom,\\" too... I could totally relate to it! Proposal is a great story, very true to reality (no, we don't live in igloos and are part of the US) and the actors were incredibly talented and funny and conveyed that spirit of New York vs. Alaska, good family boy vs. independent business lady, and the level of stupidity and humiliation immigration can put you through.  I was glad that my daughters could watch it, too (a few moments of nudity and a lot of respect and romance).  I fell in love with Ryan and was about to travel to Sitka to meet him and his family, but my husband stopped me right in time. Happy New Year everybody!
0449000729|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I had read \\"London\\" by Rutherford and loved it. I had been tempted to read it again until I came across the reviews of \\"Sarum\\" and decided to explore another fictional view of British History by Rutherford. \\"Sarum\\" starts out slower than \\"London\\" and a large part of the book is spent on the early history -before William the Conqueror. The stories did keep my interest. I like how every chapter is a short story taking in a certain time period and peopled by the descendants of previous characters. Intertwined in the lifes of the fictional characters are real characters or events that existed at the time.     I gave the book five stars and I don't award stars frivolously, because it is rare for me to read a book of this length without wanting a break. The stories kept my interest throughout the book. If you enjoy historical fiction, I highly recommend this book.
0446567337|5.0|This book caught me off guard - I didn't expect it to end the way it did or be the type of book it was.  I didn't think the book was predictable at all - and I'm a huge Nicholas Sparks fan.  I found myself reading this book and finding it VERY hard to put down.  Made me appreciate my husband & the true love we have... a great read.  I heard it's coming out in the movies - I hope it doesn't get ruined!
0812973992|5.0|I remember being amazed at the tightrope walk between the then brand new twin towers.  And this book, that starts out with the walker is just amazing!  The voices of all the characters are interesting and you fall in love with most of them.  This is my first book on Kindle and I read it fast.  I'll have to go to the bookstore and flip through to the chapters and see what drawings I missed.  I din't want to miss anything about this book - it is that good.
B002VXKYCS|5.0|How can anyone not love Julia Childs?  After reading her memoirs and seeing this movie I have even more respect for what she accomplished and the deep love she shared with her husband.  Both Meryl Streep and Amy Adams were excellent in their respective roles.  Cooking is never just about the food.  It's about love, culture, meditation, accomplishment, sharing and so much more.  This movie does a great job of embracing all those themes.
0743435753|3.0|I have greatly enjoyed David Weber's Honor Harrington series so far and hope to continue to do so, but I noticed some issues in Flag in Exile that have been constantly reoccurring, and it has gotten to the point that I feel the need to address these problems.  However, despite the negative tone of this review, that is not to say that I didn't enjoy the book.  On the contrary, Weber writes an interesting plot chock full of interesting characters and well-written space battles, which make the book hard to put down.  Spoilers follow.<br /><br /> Flag in Exile picks up a year or so after the events of the previous book (Field of Dishonor).  Honor has returned to Grayson (the planet she saved in Honor of the Queen) to recover from the emotional trauma of losing Paul Tankersley.  She is not given much peace, however, as she also carrying out her duties of Steadholder Harrington: the first female steadholder on a patriarchal planet.  Due to her position of power, she is forced to endure a great amount of criticism and scorn from the more traditional of Grayson's steadholders and people.  Honor needs to rise to the challenge and prove that she is not only a war hero, but a successful steadholder and politician on a world that doubts her and wishes for her to fail.<br /><br /> Outside of Grayson, the war between the Star Kingdom of Manticore and the People's Republic of Haven (the Peeps) has begun to turn in the Peeps' favour.  Despite their somewhat inferior technology, the Republic's Navy manages to capture a couple of systems, and the Kingdom fears the loss of more important allied systems.  On half-pay from Manticore's Navy, Honor is asked to serve in Grayson's Navy as admiral of the First Battle Squadron.<br /><br /> A couple of familiar faces from Honor of the Queen are brought back.  Specifically, Alfredo Yu and Mercedes Brigham hold prominent roles on Honor's flagship Terrible.<br /><br /> Various events transpire and the plot begins to unfold.  Locally on Grayson, one particularly dissatisfied steadholder, Lord Burdette, plots and succeeds in carrying out a horrible sabotage, killing both children and members of Harrington Steading, and later an assassination attempt, resulting in a very unfortunate and unexpected death.  While these unfortunate events occur, the Peeps are carefully executing a plan to invade the Endicott system (where Grayson is located).<br /><br /> Honor is forced to defend her, well, honour in an intense, to-the-death fencing match against Burdette and then immediately steps into the role of Admiral Harrington to defend the Endicott system.  In a climactic naval battle, Honor takes heavy losses, but manages to hold the enemy at bay and even take out a majority of the invading force.  Through her courage and determination, she saves Grayson for a second time, proving herself as a true heroine in Grayson's eyes.<br /><br /> One can hardly complain about the overall plot of the book.  It's gripping and often exciting.  Even though I don't particularly enjoy politics, I flew through the political portions of the book (mostly dealing with Grayson politics, which are actually rather intriguing).  I suppose one minor complain that could be made here is that the situation in which Honor is seemingly the underdog, hopelessly outnumbered with her damaged ships, yet possesses the courage and determination to fight to the death to protect a greater cause is becoming a bit tiresome.  Otherwise, the plot is fantastic.<br /><br /> The characters are also well thought out.  Weber seems to take great care in making sure the reader gets to know the supporting cast just as much as the main characters.  I personally enjoy reading about the various viewpoints, thoughts, and even quirks of characters aside from the hero of the story.  The author certainly doesn't shy away from killing off a character that the reader has gotten to know and attached to.  Even the Peeps, the bad guys of the book, are given personalities, and one can see that not all members of the Republic's Navy are evil simply because they are not on the \\"good\\" side.  It's great to see that the supporting characters are given so much attention and life, and it certainly adds a new aspect to the story.<br /><br /> Unfortunately, this brings me to one of the main problems with this book: Honor Harrington herself.  Weber obviously loves his main character, and while he takes the time to ensure that the reader really knows the minor characters, Honor is becoming something of a caricature.  Simply put, she is too perfect.  She has already proven herself to be a competent commander in the navy and it is made clear that she is also successful in the political arena, even when the odds are stacked against her.  Her plans rarely seem to fail, and even when they blow off course, something occurs to make them succeed anyway.  Not only can she succeed there, but she's also very accomplished in hand to hand combat.  Before Flag in Exile, we knew she could shoot and was practically a master in a form of martial arts.  In this book, we are also made aware that, despite only having a year or so of training, she is also amazing with a sword, even going as far as to defeat an opponent who has had a considerably greater amount of experience.  At this point, she is also physically attractive and her beauty is described or referred to several times in the novel (as well as her soprano voice).  She can do no wrong, and even when she is considered to have made a mistake, she is still right in the eyes of the higher ups.  Honestly, this all might not be so bad if she was aware of her success, but she maintains a naïve modesty and refuses to acknowledge her accomplishments.  Honor succeeds at everything she tries, often making her difficult to relate to and sometimes a bit of a pain to read.<br /><br /> What also becomes tiresome is the degree to which Honor is the centre of attention.  Manticore's officers and higher ups all respect and love her (even though they have been forced to put her on half-pay), the Peeps respect and fear her, and Grayson's Protector (Benjamin Mayhew IX) and the other prominent figures that matter respect and are concerned for her.  Everyone knows who she is and has some reaction to just how good she is.  I was always under the impression that there were other people in the galaxy who were more successful and prestigious than Honor, but Honor is still portrayed as being the best.  Even Hamish Alexander is written as being second rate.<br /><br /> What comes as a double-edged sword for me is Honor's pain for those who die in combat.  While I'm glad that Weber has opted for Honor to feel some emotion for the inevitable losses of military battle instead of casting them aside as unimportant, he tends to take it to an almost melodramatic degree.<br /><br /> Nimitz manages to provide Honor with yet another advantage.  The two of them share a rare (practically the only) telepathic link that allows them to share their emotions.  It also allows Nimitz to portray others' emotions to Honor.  This was an interesting idea when it was first introduced, but has now just become another instrument to make Honor better than everyone else.<br /><br /> Moving away from the character of Honor, the portrayal of the really bad guys (Burdette, Marchant, and the Citizen Commissioners, for example) is starting to bother me.  They're all just unbelievably, stereotypically evil (and often shortsighted in their extreme evilness).  I'd hoped for some more ambiguous antagonists by this point; perhaps a character that actually has believable, relatable motives and goals.  Instead, all we get are plotting, scheming archetypes with no goals other than to bring the mighty Honor Harrington down.<br /><br /> Like I said before, despite my negativity, I actually liked the plot and events of this book a lot.  My actual rating is a 3.5, but I've rounded down to 3 because Honor is becoming way too unbelievable and difficult to read and relate to.  I've actually noticed the problems mentioned above in the earlier books, too, but decided to give Weber the benefit of the doubt (and give him more time to get a feel for his main character), but by this point, it seems that things aren't going to change.  I sincerely hope that the next books do something to make Honor less perfect.  So, Flag in Exile had a tight plot and some really interesting supporting characters, but the reoccurring issues are starting to get distracting.  3.5 stars.f-pay), the Peeps respect and fear her, and Grayson's Protector (Benjamin Mayhew IX) and the other prominent figures that matter respect and are concerned for her.

B000003489|5.0|Giant Steps was recorded right around the time as another classic featuring Coltrane's playing, Miles Davis's Kind of Blue.  The two albums couldn't be different - one is mellow, laid-back, introverted, and the other is exuberant and explosive.    Up until this point Coltrane had recorded quite a few albums under his name, but Giant Steps was only the second (after Blue Train) to focus primarily on his own compositions.  Unlike Blue Train, which was recorded almost two years earlier and fit comfortably in the then-mainstream hard bop style, Giant Steps saw Coltrane taking elements of bebop and pushing them as far as they could go.  So you get plenty of dense, chord-oriented improvisation at fast tempos.    That aspect of the music probably makes this album appealing to musicians, but the album's catchy melodies and more generally Coltrane's gift for focused improvisation reaches out to plenty of casual fans.  It's one of his most popular albums.  There are of course the aforementioned \\"studies\\" of difficult chord progressions at fast tempos - \\"Giant Steps\\" and \\"Countdown\\" (which opens with a fiery saxophone-drums duet).  There are also several mellower explorations - the blues \\"Cousin Mary\\" and the almost Monkish \\"Syeeda's Song Flute\\".  And \\"Naima\\", recorded about half a year after the other tunes, is one of Coltrane's most beautiful ballads - it's such a lovely melody that Coltrane refrains from improvising, playing it pretty straight, bracketing an exquisite meditation by pianist Wynton Kelly.  He'd play \\"Naima\\" for the rest of his career - in 1961 with Eric Dolphy on bass clarinet, in the mid-60s with his classic quartet, and in 1966 with Pharoah Sanders.  Another tune from this album that he would revisit is the blistering closer, \\"Mr. P.C.\\" - this version is relatively short, but sometimes it would stretch to over half an hour in concert.    It seems like the alternate takes get a mixed review here.  I don't listen to them as much as I do to the original album,but they're interesting to have and shed light on Coltrane's thinking as a musician.  Some of them predate the actual Giant Steps album by 2 months and are effectively a dry run.    The sound, as with many Atlantic recordings from the 50s and early 60s, is not that great; compare it to the richness and warmth of Coltrane's Prestige, Blue Note and Impulse! Recordings.    To wrap up: a few of the other reviews compare this album to Sonny Rollins's Saxophone Colossus - recorded almost three years earlier, also with a quartet, also featuring pianist Tommy Flanagan, and also making a reference to \\"bigness\\" in the title.  I think those comparisons are spot on - each album represents a major milestone in the development of modern tenor saxophone playing.  Though some of Coltrane's other Atlantic albums are probably better, this one is essential listening.
0887307280|5.0|You need to buy this book if you're a small business person or a sole practitioner or artist of any sort thinking of starting a small business. Gerber has a very important concept that is so often overlooked: to turn yourself from an artisan to a business person, you need to stop working IN your business and start working ON your business.    The best way, he says, to think of this is to imagine if you had to \\"franchise\\" your business. Is the way you're doing things systematic enough that it can be replicated all over the country? In reality, of course, the odds that you WILL franchise your business are negligible, but the same method of thinking will allow you to:    ...expand your business to include more employees    ...allow you to go on VACATION with a free and easy conscience    ....allow someone else to pick up the slack if you fall ill.    There are some other good points in here (the value of consistency, etc.) A definite must read for the small business owner.    Having said all this, I am not really sure why Gerber \\"revisited\\" his original E-myth. If you can find a copy of the original, it was even better, lacking the superfluous \\"sarah\\" character who mars and confuses this revised edition slightly.

0439023491|5.0|When Suzanne Collins set out to write a sequel to the New York Times Bestseller The Hunger Games, she had a seemingly impossible task on her hands. Because, in my opinion, there was no topping The Hunger Games. But oh how Ms. Collins proved me wrong. So. Very. Wrong!<br /><br />Catching Fire takes place six months after the Hunger Games, when Katniss and Peeta have returned home to District 12. I don't want to spoil this great read by giving you too much information. But, I will tell you that although Katniss and Peeta have survived the Hunger Games, their defiance against the harsh rules will not go un-noticed by the Capitol. Even though it seems impossible for the pair to be in greater danger than when they were in the Hunger Games themselves, Katniss and Peeta soon find that life outside the arena might be as bad, if not worse.<br /><br />The pages of Catching Fire are fueled by the promise of uprising in the districts, rebellion against the Capitol, and kissing. Lots and lots of kissing. I'll admit it, even though it's kind of embarrassing, but I read just about every book just for the kissing. Fortunately for me, Ms. Collins doesn't let me down in Catching Fire. In fact, she succeeded in adding more kissing in Catching Fire than in its predecessor, by way of possibly the sweetest love triangle I've read, yet. And because both Gale and Peeta are perfect, in their own way, for Katniss, it's almost impossible to choose which team I want to side with.<br /><br />Currently, I'm siding with Team Peeta (it may change, but I doubt it. He's so dreamy!).<br /><br />So, if you haven't read The Hunger Games, well first, shame on you. Go get it now! And, once you finish you must immediately start reading Catching Fire. I promise you won't be disappointed.<br /><br />The third book in The Hunger Games trilogy will be released on August 24, 2010. So, until that time comes, I'll be off in Peeta land, dreaming of the perfect, happy ending I hope for (*hint, hint* Suzanne, you have to make Katniss choose Peeta, and give them their happy ending. If you don't, well I'll still love the book, but after I finish, I might die of heartbreak! I'll die, I tell you. Now, you don't want that, do you? So, pretty please with cherries and chocolate on top will you let Katniss and Peeta live together happily ever after? PPPLLLEEEAAASSSSEEE! ) but is not promised to me in any way, shape, or form.

B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This is a book that you do not want to put down.  Some parts you can guess at what the author is trying to hide but several sections did suprise me.  Aftet reading this book Im going to DC to take a look at the sites.
B001PJ7TUE|5.0|2009 graced us with Invaders Must Die, which is a classic-sounding Prodigy album with all original members returning. We do see some evolution however, as Prodigy are a band that constantly introduces new sounds and styles to their mix. The title track is amazing and catchy, but \\"Take Me To The Hospital\\" stands out, as it manages to blend Liam Howlett's signature break beat sound with the fiery vocals of Keith Flint better than 1997's overrated single \\"Firestarter\\".    \\"Colours\\" pummels the listener with a fast, inventive, and enticing beat, backed by a buzzing synth bass and topped off with a catchy 8-bit-sounding keyboard crescendo melody that makes this the album's best track.    \\"Run With The Wolves\\", a vocal-heavy track, features the group's new-found  love for more distorted synth sounds and the signature Prodigy pounding beat, avoiding the standard four on the floor that every other electronic artist embraces in nearly every song. The group also manages to avoid falling in the trap many of their peers do that involves repetitive dance songs free from any musical progression (besides getting louder and faster).    The only song that really lacks anything special would have to be \\"Stand Up\\", a completely instrumental closing track that sounds more like a high school marching band than Prodigy. It does feature some synth, but only for a few seconds at a time. Other than that, the album displays the group's power, creativity, and progression.    Musically, the beats are more calculated, but not overly complex to the point where you can't follow them. The synth melodies follow this pattern as well (\\"World's On Fire\\") and both of these points illustrate Howlett's patience, skill, and passion as the primary composer.    Invaders Must Die is easily the best electronic album of 2009 and definitely one of the ten best releases of 2009.
0470477237|3.0|Qualman does a very good job telling the reader why social media and social media marketing are not flash-in-the-pan fads that will be gone within a few years.  Savvy marketers and brand builders must understand the new media environment in which they are operating and embrace it as the future.  It is how things will be for a long time to come.  Qualman helps you understand the environment and offers some insights on how others have leveraged social media to their perceived advantage.<br /><br />The problems I have with this book stem from my perception that the author offers what seem like well pondered conclusions but reveals no data, no research and very little support evidence or hard quantitation so I was left to wonder if these \\"facts\\" are based on hard data or on the author's own biases and cheery assumptions.<br /><br />He seems to talk about the 2008 U.S. presidential election a little too much throughout the book which is a bit annoying for business professionals looking for application and then late in the book Qualman delves into human resource management as related to social media and it just seems to go a bit overboard.  Advice like, \\"[hire young talent and] simply get out of the way because the young talent may be vastly more talented in certain areas\\" may be accurate but it is so vague and general that it is worthless advice.  One assumes he means that because young talent is much more in tune with social media that they will be able to perform better at job functions that have ties to social media, but again, no specifics, no details and no supporting evidence for this claim.  It is at these moments in the book that it seems the author is a bit too much of a kool-aid drinking cheerleader simply repeating, \\"this changes everything.\\"  We've heard all the hype already. Now let's get down to specifics.

B001NESPHC|5.0|This 24-year old soulful jazz singer/songwriter from Philly shines on her second studio album. My One & Only Thrill includes dark, piano ballads, as well as finger-snapping smooth jazz songs with the occasional scat vocals.    I first heard this album at work and brushed it off. After all, I'm into metal, hardcore, and other styles of heavy rock music, so the soft sounds of Ms. Gardot didn't take well to my ears. However, after hearing it a few times, the melodies began to stick in my head, the lyrics began to impact my thought, and Melody's voice began to penetrate my soul.    \\"Your Heart Is A Black As Night,\\" a stand-out track, sounds like it was taken directly from the 40's, with the classic horns and stand-up bass arrangement. \\"Our Love Is Easy\\" is a dramatic-sounding soft-ballad that reaches the soul and never lets up. Ironically though, there is no climax to the song. It's simply so good that a peak is not needed. Gardot's voice is soft, yet powerful as she croons the dangerously poetic lyrics \\"They say the poisoned vine, breeds a finer wine.\\" It doesn't end there though, with the lead single \\"Baby I'm A Fool\\" presenting the lyrics, \\"Baby I'm A Fool who thinks it's cool to fall in love,\\" which seem so obvious and easy, yet they haven't been written until now. Gardot also manages to take the classic \\"Somewhere Over The Rainbow,\\" a song I always hated, and make it sound incredible.     One of the great things about Gardot is also the fact that she can and does SING her songs. With Johnny Cash-esque trail-offs and vibrato that would make Tony Bennett proud, it is clear that there is no \\"auto-tune\\" on this record. Also interesting to note is that she writes her own songs and plays both piano and guitar on them (a rarity these days).    With haunting lyrics, beautiful melodies, and skillful instrumentation, My One & Only Thrill is truly an album that pays homage to classic jazz sounds while still remaining ahead of it's time and one of 2009's best releases.
B002RSDW80|4.0|As a young American boy growing up in rural France, I learned early on that French cooking can be sublime and that the key to healthy eating is really enjoying your food.  While my American cousins in the US had their birthday parties at Chuck E. Cheese and played \\"pin the tail on the donkey\\" and \\"musical chairs,\\" we had many parties at which the only activity would be cooking contests.  Ecah child would get three ingredients upon entering the maison, and was told to make the best dish he or she could manage within, say, a two and a half hour cooking time.  The winner got a special prize of a blue ribbon, the traditiona; \\"cordon bleu\\" of the master chef.  When Julia Child (played by Meryl Streep) came to France, she was childless and felt the absence of living children ruefully.  It was all the more ironic, my mother told us, that her last name was \\"Child.\\"  Streep maybe overplays this a little bit, for when you see the movie, and Meryl Streep is bustling across a town square and she happens to see a child, which she must have seen daily, she crumples her face and clutches the hand of Paul Child (played by Stanley Tucci) and understanding Paul must cheer her up, usually by taking her to a three star restaurant and ordering some boned fish.<br /><br />I feel that if Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams) had had children too, or even cared about them, the dynamic of Nora Ephron's popular 2009 biopic would have altered considerably.  As one watches Julie & Julia today, does no one flash on Luis Bunuel's That Osbcure Object of Desire and his use of Angela Molina and Carole Bouquet to play the same part (Conchita)?  To me Ephron was trying to pull off something of the surrealist impudence of Bunuel and she's certainly earned the right to go there, after all those movies with Meg Ryan.<br /><br />We kept waiting for Julie's cat to have a reaction shot all its own, and finally in the very last reel of the movie there it is.  The cat stretches out in spastic ecstasy (looks like an expensive CGI shot) at something extraordinary in Julie Powell's change of heart.  I love when directors cut to the pet of the main characters to signal how animals see behind temporary misunderstandings to penetrate right to the heart of a cute situation.<br /><br />I also was reminded of The Wizard of Oz as Meryl Streep walks around urban Paris and everyone is shorter than her.  They must have picked little people to play the little people.  And say, when did Meryl Streep become to go-to girl for expressions of delight and pleasure?  In this movie and in Mamma Mia, every frame has her breaking into ecstatic smiles at how fabulous foreign people are (food too).

B002OPZ37E|4.0|So these guys went from being an underground favorite last year to being on the cover of AP, owning the crowd at Warped Tour, and having over 300,000 friends on Myspace. However, with all the fame comes the haters. Their eagerly-awaited second  record Homesick dropped this spring and with it did their cred in the hardcore scene.    If you ask me, not much has changed. Sure, the production is a little over the top, but the band's sound isn't too different. If anything, they've gotten heavier. But, with success comes detractors. Don't let anyone tell you otherwise about this record though. Sure, the album's sound is very polished. Jeremy's vocals sound so spot on, it's obvious he's auto-tuned beyond belief. If you don't believe me, You Tube any live video of them and you'll see the difference. The instruments are pretty damn spot on with each other as well, which kinda takes away from the whole natural and organic feel of a real band. But don't let that ruin the CD for you. The songwriting is what it's all about on this release. And these guys have it down.    The lead single \\"Downfall Of Us All,\\" along with stand-out tracks like \\"My Life For Hire,\\" \\"NJ Legion Iced Tea,\\" and the ballad-ish \\"Have Faith In Me\\" all prove that these guys have the ability to write memorable tunes. Don't believe me? Answer this: what other band can write a CATCHY breakdown?    The band's lyrics this time around deal with not only personal relationships, but also the strains of being in a band and life on the road, including the detractors (it's almost as if they could predict what was going to happen).    In short, if you like pop-punk and/or hardcore and can get past some over-production and a vocalist that uses way too much auto-tune (and possibly some  advanced computer effects on the low scream/growls), this is a record for you and one of 2009's best.
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|Awesome movie!  Kids will love the characters while parents will enjoy the themes and content!
B0015AARJI|5.0|The dualshock Playstation controller has been my favorite controller design since it first came out for the PS1. Now that it is wireless with the PS3 it is even better. Nothing bad to say about it.
B0029LHX1W|4.0|A little confusing early on when it jumps from one scene to another, but it does all come together. The author captures the scenes without any verbose descriptions. Hard to put down.
0385504225|2.0|Mediocre plot, forgettable characters, an underwhelming return for Dan Brown.  You'd think a six year effort could produce better results.  I like the Robert Langdon character and enjoyed the previous two novels; if Brown writes another I hope he goes back to Europe and delves more into its history.
B00005JNQA|3.0|To be fair, the script has possibilities, but it would take the pacing of Hitchcock's direction and the narrative expressiveness of Jimmy Stewart's acting to save it from becoming perhaps the new millennium's slowest film to date.  Unfortunate, because in a sense all of us are \\"interpreters\\" of the actions of others, frequently tempted, moreover, to \\"over-interpret\\" by taking the law into our own hands, countering terrorism with vengeful personal righteousness that merely contributes to a terrorist mentality on an ever-widening scale.  The political message is sound; the entertainment value conducive to a sound sleep.
B002XTBE8I|5.0|The only negative is that the only way to buy the 7 additional tracks is by purchasing the Relapse CD again. It would've been nice to buy the refill as a stand-alone CD. Besides that, the CD does not disappoint.  The songs all continue with the same theme from Relapse. \\"Favor my favorite Graham Crackers with John Benet Rams. I guess a modern day Jack the Ripper is all that I am.\\" So if you liked the Relapse, you will love Refill. The beats are strong and Em does a solid job with the tracks.
B00005AG7K|3.0|Third-Party Sellers are offering copies of the movie for $40 and up, claiming them to be re-mastered, &c., but who knows.<br /><br />My advice is to buy the $10 copy first.  It is washed out, but you get the gyst of the story and then, if you REALLY like it, shell out the $40. (But I'd email them first for a guarantee that it's truly a cleaned up version.)<br /><br />I suspect, though, that after watching the movie, you'll be happy you only spent $10.
B001W6S0C6|1.0|What was Tim Burton thinking. This is terrible. I mean this is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. I say it's the worst movie I've ever seen because people actually consider this a classic. I hate this movie because the writing was corny and michael k. and jack n. didn't whats so ever convince me as their roles in the movie. This movie was split on how it tried to act because this movie is too campy for adults but too dark for kids and yes I did say campy  because every part of this was campy. there were 5 things i this movie that completely killed the movie for me and those are batman killing people because if you were a true fan of batman you know he doesn't kill also the joker shouldn't at any time be dancing to prince music also the danzel in distress oh I'm sorry I mean the leading female role was terrible and the joker doesnt kill batmans parents and not only that whay was batman always making a stupid dramatic entrance every time he appears in the movie. he's suppose to be a silent creature of the night. So in conclusion this movie sucks, period.
B00129H7VS|5.0|Great Series! I love this on Blue Ray with the additional features and commentary.  Perfect!
0930289234|5.0|I used to not read comic books. Until I walked in the book store and saw this trade that was misplaced in a different section than it was supposed to be in. So when I picked it up just out of curiosity I was amazed. This is not only one of the most greatest comic books ever but this is one of the greatest books overall ever.
0439023491|5.0|Better than the First!!<br /> Once again Ms. Collins brings an extremely amazing roller coaster ride to her eager audience who have been anxiously waiting the return of Katniss and Peeta who at the end of The Hunger Games left us wishing we could learn more. After winnig the Hunger Games Katniss and Peeta are now residing in Victors Village and though it would seem as if their life is set after their victory, not everything is as it seems. Haunted by their atrocious ordeals, and not knowing who they really are and what they are to do for the rest of their lives, they are once again entrenched in the machinations of President Snow who still holds Katniss responsible for going against the government and everything it stands for in her blatant disregard for the rules. Unbeknown to Katniss her victorious survival during the Hunger Games spurred the spirit of rebellion which had been brewing in many of the districts, and it is now up to her to decide if she wants to become the symbol of freedom or just accept the rules and constraints that have been placed on her in order to survive and save everybody she loves.<br />  Even better than the first installment of the series, I have to say that this is one of the best written stories I've read in a while. Funny and witty yet sometimes so heart wrenchingly painful that it brings tears to your eyes it is an amazing storyline that reaches the depths of your being. The characters are well developed and you are able to relate to, root for Katniss and Peeta following their lives.<br /> The theme of political control, where people are starving and subjugated to horrendous conditions is another aspect of the novel which becomes real and you can't help but to think of all of the people in the \\"real\\" world that are going throughout those same situations.<br /> Filled with suspense that leaves you hanging to the edge of your seat, I was able to finish this book in a few hours and now I'm lamenting the 8 month wait for the finally of the amazing series.e amazing series.
B000FBJAOG|4.0|This book was fantastic. I am a big fan of zombie and horror books and added to the fact that it was writen by Mel Brooks' son made this a must read for me. My only complaint is that, at the end, the real life accounts were a little redundant at times.
B000MRAAJM|5.0|What a wonderful series for the whole family. I too was surprised when I received my copy and the packaging said 1080i. But once I started watching and checked the source through both my Oppo player and Pioneer Plasma I discovered it was in true 1080p. There was no picture flickering (which can occur with non-plasma HDTVs) so beware of what HDTV you are watching it on. Also, you need a high quality sound system and not just the TV speakers to get the impact of the great sound.    Well worth the money.
0316776963|5.0|This was the first David Sedaris book I came across. After reading Me Talk Pretty One Day, I immediately needed more Sedaris. I've never laughed out loud while reading before finding this gem and became addicted to Sedaris' storytelling. Simple observations and family related memories are delivered with wit and enthusiasm. The only thing better than reading Sedaris is listening to Sedaris. Luckily, he reads his stories in the audiobook versions, which adds another dimension of character to what is already sublimely funny.
0812973992|2.0|I grew up in NY & love it.   The best thing for me in the book were the descriptions of places I have known for decades.   The basic idea of the book is brilliant: a tapestry of this fascinating city at a moment of transcendent personal achievement, Philippe Petit's walk/dance across a wire between the Twin Towers.    Each chapter, told from inside the mind of a particular character, is like a writing class exercise.   Some of the characters are interesting, others aren't.   I found that I was often bored, wondering how much more time I would have to spend with an uninteresting person.  Based on what I had read about this novel, I kept expecting an ending that would brilliantly bring the disparate parts & characters together.   It didn't happen.   All in all, this trip isn't worth the effort.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|Science Fiction Version of Dances with Wolves    PLOT: Evil humans have depleted the natural resources of Earth. An evil corporation from Earth with the assistance of evil military from Earth tried to rape another planet of its natural resources to fuel humans' insatiable need for technology and power and kill the indigenous people who get in the way. When the evil ones are about to kill the indigenous people's deity, the indigenous people retaliate against the evil corporation from Earth and evil military from Earth with unfettered hatred (indigenous people incorporated high tech weapons from the humans to help them fight). When the indigenous people are about to be defeated, their deity intervenes and saves the planet (Mother Nature triumphantly does to the humans what they were going to do to her and her people). Once the evil military is thwarted, all the humans except for a few (those who have been enlightened) are forced off of the planet never to return. Those who are left behind have the privilege of living in a utopia and replacing their evil human bodies to take on the perfect anatomy of the indigenous people and worship Mother Nature who slaughtered thousands of humans.    AGENDA: Couldn't they find a cheaper and more honest way of promoting green (350 million dollar propaganda commercial). Leave all the resources in the ground and kill corporate giants was the message. I wonder how much of the movie used green technology. Like most of Hollywood, they never practice what they preach.    CHARACTERS: The villains of the movie were way over the top, unbelievable. Most were based on false premises--political caricatures of corporate giants and the military. Most of the heroes were static; they lacked any character flaws. Sully had the greatest transformation both psychologically and physically. In the beginning, the evil military forced Sully to fight in a war where he lost the use of his legs from injury. At the end of the movie, the perfect indigenous people and their deity gave Sully a perfect body because he denounced his evil human race and adopted the perfect way of the perfect indigenous people.    SERMON: The whole movie hinged on the idea that those who live as one-with-nature and are absent of all technology are better. And those who use natural resources to create technology are evil. And that all the comforts in modern human society have been created at the expense of those who are one-with-nature. BALDERDASH! Avatar was the science fiction version of Dances with Wolves. It was high technology that produced the movie. Its writers drive high tech cars, its producers live in mansions, and its actors live in the lap of luxury. This was the biggest propaganda since Hitler and his anti Jewish movement.    PREACHY: WOW! While watching this movie, I kept having flash backs to hellfire and brimstone sermons I had to hear growing up in church. Half way through, I was expecting the movie to pause so that we could sing hymns to MOTHER NATURE while ushers passed around offering plates. When the movie ended, I was also expecting the high priest of the church of environmentalology, Al Gore, and his prophet, James Cameron, to step out and usher everyone to the altar for repentance where cups of Cool Aid would be distributed to all new converts.    WHY ONE STARS: The CGI was phenomenal, the fictitious world was awesome, the action was great, and the whole avatar concept to interact with the indigenous people was brilliant. But these elements alone do not merit a five star rating.
B0012GMW0C|5.0|I've listened to pretty much all of Journey's albums and this is without a doubt their best album.  The guitar solo in the last few minutes of the song 'Of A Lifetime' blew me away into space!!! It is awesome beyond words.  The rest of the songs on the album are good too but 'Of A Lifetime' stands out as the favorite.    'Next' (Journey's 3rd album) is also a good album too, so check it out if you like this album.
B00304LF0W|1.0|Unlike most attendees, I found this to be an incredibly bad and stupid movie. In many ways I found myself like the hero of the Charles Addams cartoon who was the only person giggling in a movie theater where everyone else was crying.  In my case, I was the only person giggling at an incredibly stupid movie while the entire rest of the theater was engaged in discovering new ways to invoke deity (OMG!!!!).<br /><br />I also found myself getting irritated at stupidly written characters who steadfastly refused to do anything about their deteriorating circumstances. Ok, Mr. Take Charge Wannabe Tough Boyfriend,  why didn't you do anything for your girlfriend day upon day upon day?  She wanders outside, spends the night on the porch, and freezes herself out. She has no memory of this. Duuude!  This is not normal!  Take her to a physician! She stands over your bed all night long and has no memory.  Duuude! Take her to a shrink!  This is way past six or seven standard deviations from the mean!<br /><br />Mr. Take Charge Wannabe Tough Boyfriend:  when you know that there is something that wrong and you oppose her admittedly lame attempts to get help, you have issues as well, and risking sounding cold and arrogant, I had one of my biggest laughs at the ending of the film in the theater.  You sooo asked for that one.<br /><br />For the heroine, is there only one parapsychologist you could consult?  You let it drift for that long?  Really?<br /><br />Look, the movie has some shock value.  It does manage to surprise, but the result not long after is growing disbelief as the stupidity continues, gets expanded and then eats the entire movie.<br /><br />If you want to scare yourselves, watch this when it comes out on HBO.  Personally, I'm looking forward to the Rifftrax version.
0316017922|4.0|In many respects, Outliers reminded me of Freakonomics.  Gladwell offers unexpected and often shocking explanations for various social and economic phenomenon from success criteria for technology entrepreneurs to the secrets behind Asian students' higher math scores.      The best parts of the book are chapters 1 and 2 where the explanations of the true success factors behind the Beatles, Bill Gates and Canadian Hockey players are explained.  After that the content is still good, but less interesting.  There were only two of the last seven chapters that I found to be compelling. In chapter seven on the \\"Ethnic Theory of Plane Crashes,\\" Gladwell offers some intriguing theories as to why airlines from certain countries such as Columbia and South Korea have more accidents than others.  And in chapter eight on \\"Rice Paddies and Math Tests,\\" Gladwell provides very logical explanations as to why students from Korea, Japan and China gain advantages in math over American students.
B002WTOXUK|1.0|This was an unrelenting exercise in the examination of human misery--obviously based on the personal societal background of the movie's director.  The darkness at the center of this movie, so directly based in South African social and racial inequities, makes it really difficult to find anyone or anything about the film worthy of any sympathy.  A major part of the film is devoted to the misery of a petty bureaucrat who gets \\"infected\\" by the aliens and who starts transforming into one of them. The squalid nature of the bureaucrat and his life makes it difficult to do anything other than watch the misery of his transition in disgust and in the realization that he deserved it.<br /><br />The aliens, as can be expected in exercises in self-revulsion such as this, were portrayed as being the nasty products of a nasty situation, but they were portrayed as having nobility.  However, it is difficult to appreciate the nobility of indiviudals as degraded and nasty as the aliens in this film.<br /><br />In many ways, I'd characterize this movie as yet another entry in the corrupt-overlord/noble-subjugated sweepstakes.<br /><br />An ending comment: as memory serves, most of the substance needed to power the shuttle and ship was destroyed in the film-ending fight.  Why did it take so long for them to get their acts together to leave?  Do they like being degraded that much?  Why was it left to a lone alien engineer and his offspring to get everything together?  In a space faring civilization, wouldn't some sort of organized effort have been made to get the substance together so that they could leave or send for help? It seems that several plot holes attack the internal credibility of the film.<br /><br />If you enjoy \\"cinema\\" that is an unrelenting exercise in self-loathing criticism of the fundamental nature of the human race, then this is the movie for you.
B002VKE0XA|4.0|This movie was real good. It starts off slow then picks up and scared the crap out of me as it went along.    The question I have is..since the move was filmed  in home video .... What will blu-ray offer? maybe extra footgage but how will it improve the image?
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|I just recieved a new Kindle for Christmas so I wanted to buy \\"The Lost Symbol\\" but after reading all the bad reviews I tried it first. I read about three chapters and was hooked. This is a really good book so don't believe all the bad reviews. I haven't finished it yet but it is well worth it.    Enjoy!
0143038419|1.0|This book is just another proof that we now have the luxury of having any type of nonsense or boring \\"life experience\\" published. I read a very lengthy review here on amazon by a person who loved the book \\"...for what it is.\\" Do read the review before purchasing it. I think it very nicely explains what the book is not, so you spare yourself the disappointment. Too bad what the book IS doesn't seem to be much to an intelligent reader either. I didn't expect it to be a deep, life changing book, but rather a journal about a woman's experience traveling around the world. Too bad even with my low expectations, the book proved to be boring and pretty much a \\"story\\" any stranger met at a bar could tell you over drinks. So why pay for it? What's funny to me is that as I turned each page, despite the author writing about being in those wonderful places, all I could think of to say to her was \\"get a life.\\" I honestly don't see much point in spending money on this unless you are the author's friend genuinely interested in what she has to say. But if you're looking for these sort of no-point scribbles of a person who is traveling to run away from ordinary problems most of us go through anyways, why don't you read some blog instead. At least the bloggers don't expect you to pay for their \\"stories.\\"
B0000630BT|4.0|To me the best hard rock is the melodic type,  this was priest leaving my favorite type that they do so well from 1974-1989 and delving into speed metal.  Priest does speed metal fantastically.  But it is the older style of music that  is more accessible and fun for me; and it was that music that could appeal accross boundries unlike the barely listened to types of thrash/growl metal that is programmed today on the few channels left playing hard rock.  Speed metal is better than the growl metal in my book but it's still less about melody than great hard metal rock.  Priest is so great a band though that they make speed metal sound good to me! At least most of the songs on here sound listenable. Personally I don't listen to this one as much as any earlier priest discs but it remains one of the few speed metal discs that I can listen to. I love iron maiden , helloween and they play fast rock but this they are highly melodic and take a different path, this is priest doing less melodic music , but any form of hard rock they try they rule over. Even if it isn't my favorite type of hard rock. (speed)
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Hello,<br />I am an Avid Fantasy Sci Fi Reader and movie watcher. When I went to this movie I was captivated with the beauty of it and the story told. Yes it is a story told time and again I have read many and was very moved by this movie. ANyone who gave this less than five stars must not have seen it in 3D which is the only way to see it. I loved and I hope it comes out in 3D for my Television. Just an Amazing movie.
B00005OCMR|5.0|You won't see a copy, spin-off of this movie... if anyone even tried, it would be a blatant rip-off, extremely obvious and not as well done.<br /><br />Imagine your favorite video game... now imagine the packets of information, each part of the game, and not just the characters being living, breathing people with only a small amount of information.<br /><br />What happens when, in order to make something work, or to stop a crash in the game, you are that part of the equation that needs to get through the circuit board in order to get the correct information there, and at just the right time, with a number of obstacles in your way.<br /><br />OK, so I'm being a bit cryptic about the plot (actually only given a small glimpse of the characters and really nothing of the plot at all), but a movie every computer user should see, so if you are reading this, buy the movie!<br /><br />I remember seeing this when it 1st came out! A bit of the technology is a bit dated, but the only changes really are smaller, faster, more efficient, and more user friendly for the non-technically inclined. A lot more memory in a much smaller space, generally used for sloppy programming, but essentially the same...<br /><br />If you don't understand the math co-processor and other references, just realize that these were once peripheral cards to the motherboard, and now they are essentially airbrushed onto your CPU!<br /><br />Nostalgic movie for long-term computer techs, an education for others, and an interesting story woven into it.<br /><br />Nothing has ever been made like it, and nothing ever will capture this again!

Patrick and his friend, Bubba, scare off the attempted assailent and think they are finished.<br /><br />Later, Kenzie gets a call from Karen but it doesn't sound urgent and he doesn't return it. Then, he learns that Karen has committed suicide by jumping off of a high rise building.<br /><br />Feeling a deep sense of guilt, Patrick begins looking into Karen's life, from the time he last saw her. He uncovers a plot which appears as if someone deliberately set out to destroy this innocent woman's life and her will to live. In despair, he contacts Angela and she agrees to rejoin him. Together, they delve into the reasons why anyone would do something like this and Patrick plans his own retribution.<br /><br />Lehane has given his readers a stand alone novel detailing the wickedness that a person can do. Similar plots have been written, but in this case, Lehane does a good job. Patrick and Angela are always interesting to read about and when they work together, they create a dialogue between them that makes them a special couple.<br />This was a most enjoyable, stand alone thriller.
0882709194|1.0|My son gave me this book as a Christmas gift because he knows of my interest in evolution and Darwin. He was given the book at college. I read Ray Comfort's intro hoping for new insight into the subject but instead found an anti-Darwin rant. I found this to be deceptive, given the cover appears to be in Darwin's honor. Indeed my son was deceived. I suggest booksellers make clear the book's intent.
0156034026|2.0|With polished prose and clever style, a winner by the norms of contemporary fiction, Hamid strives for and may attain empathy for his narrator, Changez. The narrative is a not quite disclosed scheme against an unnamed narratee (a clumsy, insensitive American in Pakistan) as well as the reader, also addressed by Changez. I contend the author is himself trapped by doing so well at conventional literary skills in the maintained tone and style, covering over assumptions that could be questioned a bit.    Changez can be witty, warm-hearted, sardonic in his observations, his flashbacks to sojourns in a premier American university and profession, his descriptions of Lahore's local foods and people. As narrator, he's meant to spellbind both the narratee and reader, gain our understanding and empathy as he recounts crises of identity (even putting on a false identity during sex). From America, he eventually returned to Pakistan where he somehow underwent de-corruption and redemption (though this may come after whatever he does to the narratee). The novel means to dramatize the cultural and political polarities of the Pakistani and the unnamed man he talks to, who represents cultural and (possibly) military American imperialism, though it's a one-sided game.    The reader (if not the dumb narratee) need not be so spellbound. Breaking the narrative triangle, the reader may question Changez's prevailing nationalism and resentments. I didn't buy the tragic tone of Changez's prior displaced identity, his righteousness and superior self-possession. Not too far beneath the smooth surface, the narrative and narrator show a fundamentalist spirit, at its most brutal when Changez relishes the sight of slaughter of innocent people on 9/11. A more daring fiction maybe would have reversed roles: have Changez invited into the home or other context of an American who'd been murdered in the WTC that day.    I'd have liked to see some humor about Changez's plights with his rich employer and girlfriend. I'd have liked some challenge to the assumption that Pakistan is simply the victim of India, the USA, etc.    The book fits nicely into contemporary expectations for fiction. The movie version would be rated R. It would have handsome young actors, be shot in actual or authentic looking countries of origin.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|Usually I make a long and dedicated review when I give a movie a 1 star rating. I point out all it's flaws and just what makes it so bad. However, this movie doesn't even deserve that respect. I don't even know how to classify this film. The main character is highly unlikeable, the aliens are highly offensive(like you can't tell they were meant to portray minorities),The story takes too long to get going and when it does it ends up absolutely no where.<br /><br /> The Back of the DVD case says that this is an \\"EDGE OF THE SEAT!\\" film. If you mean I was sitting on the edge of my seat to get up and take this out my DVD player you are absolutely correct.<br /><br /> This is not at all what I thought it was going to be. If you could imagine mixing Mr.Bean/ID4/ALIENATION/BOYZNTHEHOOD/THELORDOFWAR/E.T./& HURRICANE KATRINA FOOTAGE, you just might come out with District9! I haven't watched a movie this bad in a very long time. The only good parts of this film worth remembering are the action sequence which are very well done (no complaints at all) but that's the only thing that salvages this movie from the \\"zero star\\" rating I wished I could give it. I guess I'm mad because I paid to see this film. It's more suitable as one of those SCI-Fi original flicks they show from time to time. Matter of fact it's just like those except with better special effects.<br /><br /> This is a FF movie...meaning it's one that you Fast Forward through most of it just to get to the interesting parts. The ending of district 9 is open and unsatisfying as hell. When you sit through a movie like this you don't want a \\"What happens next?\\" ending. You want a complete ending that finishes the movie off with no questions asked (this isn't \\"War of the Worlds\\").<br /><br /> The main character isn't at all likeable. He's more like a used car salesman. You know some quirky slime ball that just wants to smile and grin at you so he can get what he wants. The type of guy that pushes morals aside just so long as he comes out on top. That's pretty much the main character in a nut shell. You don't care what happens to him because he is annoying and you for some reason just want him to get killed off but it never happens because he is unfortunately the main guy. Other than him you won't meet anyone else that's likeable unless you want to count in the alien acquaintances that come in way later in the film.<br /><br />Bottom line-<br /><br /> District 9 just isn't a satisfying film to watch. A made for T.V. movie sure... but a theatrical piece... not hardly.<br /><br />However I'm sure there are plenty of professional reviewers who see otherwise and would give this film 2 thumbs up, but since Tri-Star hasn't given me a wad of cash to lie through my teeth as they... I will have to tell the truth. Watch this when it comes to basic cable. Do not rent, do not buy, do not waste your money on this one.at's pretty much the main character in a nut shell.

B002Q9MZHE|4.0|This film version of La Boheme is gorgeous! The cinematography is beautiful and tasteful, and the singing is all top-notch, crowned by a performance by Anna Netrebko as Mimi. Her voice has luster and charisma, and her acting is right on the money. Rolando Villaz&oacute;n's only fault, vocally, is that he is not Pavarotti; otherwise, he is among the very best tenors today, having a beautiful, powerful, and passionate voice, and impeccable technique. His acting was just a tad over the top for a film, but it would have played perfectly in the opera house.<br /><br />In a way, my review should stop here. I recommend this wholeheartedly to the most discriminating of opera lovers; and this is the first mainstream opera that I have seen on Blu-ray that can stand up to the competition in all formats. As always, however, there are a few caveats that perhaps should be mentioned.<br /><br />This is opera as film, not simply a film of a staged production, although it was inspired by the two principals' on-stage performances together. The reader/shopper probably already knows whether or not he or she likes opera presented in movie format, so I will not discuss the pros and cons, except to make two observations specific to this film: (1) this is, for much of the time, not a lip-sync job for the principals, which is unusual for opera-on-film, and (2) the director used only very sparingly (twice, I think) the device wherein singers' voices are heard without their moving their lips (as is done sometimes for day-dream sequences). In this case the main use for it was to show Mimi's inner thoughts when she would have been too weak to have sung them in real life. Returning to the first point, however, lip-syncing was used for some of the characters, in which photogenic actors were seen but opera singers were heard. There is also some lip-syncing by the principals when it was impractical to record the voices on the set.  The bonus materials mention the difficulties inherent in keeping the singers in sync with the orchestra, which was recorded in a separate studio at another time. The final result, however, is excellent; and on the whole, I'd say that this transformation of opera to the movies is less jarring than most.<br /><br />Among the 71 minutes of extras, the director, Robert Dornhelm speaks about several of the choices he made, big and small. The most important choice he made was to keep things traditional; there is no attempt to update the setting, costumes, or circumstances in order to pander to more modern, or simply restless, tastes. He wisely realized that straying from the original concept would have only taken it downhill. He had also made a version of the film in which there was somewhat extensive use of CGI and other special effects but ended up using almost none in the final cut. A few scenes are shown in black-and-white, an effect that mostly worked well and for which the justification was rather obvious; but there was one mostly black-and-white scene, in which a stand of flowers was deliberately singled out for color. While it was effective, and pleasantly reminded me of a famous scene from a Fellini movie, I did not feel that it was organic to the mood here--it was distracting, but only for a second or two, as it caused me to pause to contemplate its \\"meaning\\"; on the other hand, it could be considered a good thing that the director threw us something additional to chew on. In any case this was a rare exception within a production that is distinguished by its lack of tricks, an homage to the time-tested genius of Puccini.<br /><br />Musically, one could hardly desire more. In the beginning of the first act, the tempi may have been ever so slightly fast, and I was afraid that the conductor was going to take a somewhat business-like, let's-get-this-thing-over-with, tack; but that did not last long at all; there was plenty of good 'ole romantic wallowing in tears to come. Indeed, the quick pace of the first few moments was consistent with the vision of the film director, who conceded that the first act is the most difficult to bring off, and who opted to bring out its more humorous aspects; sparing us any unnecessarily-early hint of the pathos to come.<br /><br />The only other nit picking is to mention a couple of minor (almost theoretical) shortcomings in the final product:<br /><br />(1) The highest-tech soundtrack available on this Blu-ray is Dolby 5.1. (There is also \\"Dolby 2.0,\\" and I am not quite sure what that means -- 2-channel PCM encoded for Dolby Pro Logic, maybe, for the benefit of older receivers that cannot process a digital input?) Many operatic and concert DVDs provide DTS 5.1 as a sometimes preferable option; and of course Blu-ray often offers further enhancements to these formats, including the possibility of 5, 6, or 7 uncompressed audio channels. As something of a long-time audiophile and techno-geek, I have to mention this lack of state-of-the-art-edness; but I also have to say that it makes virtually no difference. Yes, it is conceivable that a more detailed audio could have been attained, but to what point? This Dolby 5.1 soundtrack is beautiful and perfectly fits the look of the film. For that matter, it would also have been possible to capture a more starkly detailed picture through the use of direct video, but the softer images of cinematic film better suit the mood. None of this, however, is to deny the superiority of the Blu-ray edition of this film versus the DVD; \\"softness\\" is one thing, a DVD's 5.5-times loss of detail is quite another, if one is watching on a large screen.<br /><br />(2) Kultur provides no booklet, and the jacket almost requires one to use a magnifying glass to find the name of the orchestra and conductor (both of whom contributed greatly to the overall high standard of musical performance). The only readily visible credits are to Netrebko, Villaz&oacute;n, and Dornhelm. As to the absence of program notes, the justification, no doubt, is that there is an abundance of information in the rolling credits, as well as in the generous bonus features; and of course, the optional subtitles mostly do away with any need for printing the libretto. However, on this latter point, the subtitles were not perfect; and it would have been nice to have had a printed copy of the original Italian.

B002OEBMN4|4.0|After \\"Christ Illusion\\" and \\"God Hates Us All\\" there was no telling what Slayer would come out with on this new disc.  Being a fan who has \\"God Hates Us All\\" pretty much etched into memory note for note I was looking for something along those lines for this new disc.  Needless to say that you get a little of this and a little of that with \\"World Painted Blood\\".  IT takes all the great riffs and energy from the last two albums and rolls them up into a package of flesh tearing anxiety that is not for the timid.  Really, I have a few devoted Slayer fans who say that this is too much.  What do they know.  There are many elements this band has explored over their stunning career, bay area metal, edge driven metal in the 90's, thrash metal with touches of hard core and here they all come on this disc.  Granted if you are looking for something along the lines of \\"God Hates Us All\\" or \\"Divine Intervantion\\" there is a little here for you but it is towards the end of the disc and sometimes buried inbetween some serious thrash, but worth the dig to get to because no one takes you for a loop the way that Slayer does.  This band is what real metal bands should hope to be.  I have watched so many bands \\"lighten up\\" and basically lose what makes them great metal bands.  But not Slayer.  They continue to create music in line with an ever changing world and metal scene and push boundaries only they can see.  \\"World Painted Blood\\" might not be for fair weather fans but if your Slayer collection starts at \\"Show no Mercy\\" and runs up to \\"Christ Illusion\\" then this is a disc worth having.  Thank you Slayer for giving us another great soundtrack towards the apocolypse.
B000ANVPPQ|1.0|My main criticism of all the DVD versions of this movie is that there are lines that are missing. How this happens astounds me but I know the movie well and thankfully have kept an old VHS copy that is complete. The most notable exception is the scene where Maureen O'Hara bursts in on him playing chess and Birnbaum comments her hair looks a different shade. John Wayne laughs and says he is right, she did color her hair. Why cant they transfer a movie without cutting it up? All of John Wayne's movies need authorized editions that have been remastered badly!
B00005JPSM|4.0|We have all seen the movies where someone's well-ordered life is turned upside down when he or she is unexpectedly required to raise a child -- think \\"Three Men and a Baby\\" or \\"Baby Boom\\".  That is the basic premise of this movie where Kate (played by Catherine Zeta-Jones) is the exective chef at a successful New York restaurant.  She has total control over what happens in her kitchen and her life revolves around acheiving perfection.  The life-style she leads doesn't leave much room for outside interests or family but when her sister dies, the only one that can raise her niece is her.  All this happens during a time period when a new sous chef has been hired and has a vastly different approach to cooking and running a kitchen.<br /><br />While somewhat predictable, the movie rises above the usual slap-stick humor of the other movies (which I loved.) This movie shows more of the human emotion of losing a sister and mother and the havoc it causes is portrayed with more depth and feeling.  While very humorous at times (particularly enjoyed the scene where she cooks a meal for the young niece and it ends up being a fish with its head still on - the reaction is priceless) it is more realistic than other movies along this same story line.<br /><br />Good acting, good story and a great way to spend an evening at home!
B000W4KT64|4.0|If I were reviewing this off-beat musical comedy from a political perspective I would have to classify this film about the virtues of  show tunes as a tool for racial harmony in early 1960s Baltimore, before the out-front racial polarization of the city were exposed and Spiro Agnew hit the scene, as an integrationist's daydream, and a segregationist's nightmare. And at that political level the theme just doesn't work, although the sub-theme about accepting differences (racial, ethnic, gender, size) has a certain appeal. But all of this is to take this sweet fluff of a film way beyond those rationale political parameters.    What does work? Well, a nice little odd-ball, not exactly cookie-cutter American family, circa 1960, with some big dreams and some big women (?) get to play center stage in the quest for the American dream, or one of the early 1960s variant of it- stardom in the music and/or television world.  The current \\"American Idol\\" is only the latest in a long line of such efforts. Here the plot revolves around becoming \\"top dog\\" on one of the old after school dance shows that were a staple of 1950s-early 1960s television to keep restless kids under control for a few hours until dad got home. To that extent the plot is just a ruse for some great songs about those above-mentioned social differences and how to deal with those differences in a quirky and dreamy interracial way.     The real kicker here though are the performances of John Travolta (yes, that John Travolta) as the over-sized mother, Edna, who can still dance up a storm, the usually bad guy-playing Christopher Walken as the supportive and skinny dad, Wilbur, and normally good girl, and always femme fatale Michelle Pfeiffer, as the plotting television station manager makes this thing appealing to a non-teenager. And, of course Queen Latifah being, well.... Queen Latifah. The high school kids led by Tracy (Nikki Blonsky), black and white, good or bad, sweet or vicious are just there to glue this thing together. Watch this couple of hours of an integrationist's daydream.
B002PMV9FG|1.0|This 6th movie of the Harry Potter series was not as good as I was lead to believe.  It was very dark and hard to see what was going on compared to the other movies.  I may end up selling all my other Harry Potter DVDs since I will not have a complete collection - in other words I am not keeping this one.  It also was very hard to follow the plot anymore.  It was poorly written and directed.  I would suggest that the movie be remade and with a lot more lighting, better directing, and writing.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|This movie is quirky, fun, and original. I loved the fact that this film didn't have a typical storybook ending, but still donned an optimisic one. The casting is perfect, and the film is absolutely awesome. Definitely a must see!

0307269752|4.0|I would like to sincerely thank all those who gave this book glowing reviews because without you, I never would have gotten through what turned out to be an exciting, suspenseful and intelligent novel.<br /><br />The first 200 pages of \\"The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" were like reading a balance sheet or an annual report.  Pages and pages of needlessly detailed background information.  Of the first 200 pages, maybe 60 are germane to the story<br /><br />Emblematic of the whole problem are the chapter headings, referring to the dates the events therein are meant to take place (Tuesday July 2 - Thursday July 4, e.g.).  They are of absolutely no importance.<br /><br />I believe this is Larsson's first book, and it seems as if he took the 'Novel Writing 101' exercise of realizing the most minor details of your characters and locations.  But he forgot to edit them out once he got going.  We do not need to know the minute intricacies of the office floorplan where our main character stops by for a five minute meeting.<br /><br />The real mystery here, is how a book like this could get past a large publishing house's editors.  I'm not familiar with how the publishing business works, but I'm assuming that once the book is published in Sweden, it can't be substantially edited any further for its US translation.  Regardless, someone really screwed up, but it hasn't seem to hurt the sales, reviews or the Swedish film version or no doubt the in-the-works US film remake.<br /><br />And now I will join the ranks of those whose glowing reviews kept me going:  Once the story kicks in (more or less at page 214 in my paperback edition) this is a grab-you-by-the-throat-and-don't-let-go mystery thriller told with intelligence and real human emotion.  And that's a rare thing.

B002VECLVE|1.0|Being the fourth review posted so far of this film, I am definitely in the minority by proclaiming it a gigantic mess.  There is very little story here - the bulk of the film references the \\"loving\\" relationship between the Colin Firth character and his recently departed gay lover.  The only problem is, I did not buy the depth of their love for one another, nor Firth's response to his partner's death, basically because there seemed to be no real chemistry between the two men.  In addition, there was no narrative thread in the film's script that weaved together a believable or logical story line that compelled me to feel anything whatsoever for the characters.  Everything seemed so piecemeal and artificially stylized in this movie, which left me feeling completely cold when I should have felt great warmth in response to the characters and their suffering.   I also did not connect with Firth's relationships with his best friend (played by Julianne Moore) and his stalker student (whose mad pursuit of Firth made absolutely no sense).  Everything about this film felt contrived, including Colin Firth and Julianne Moore's acting (especially Julianne Moore's utterly ridiculous British accent), as well as the motivations of the two young men in hot pursuit of Colin Firth (both of whom, by the way, looked like New York runway fashion models).  A SINGLE MAN was one of the most forced, contrived, terribly written and poorly conceived first-time directing efforts I have ever seen.  I think Tom Ford should keep making films, but not until he takes a few film school courses in Directing 101.
B002JCSWUW|5.0|'Invictus' is a Latin term meaning invincible, or unconquerable.  It is also the title of an important poem, one which Nelson Mandela found inspiring during his long walk to victory, penned in the 1800s of the same title, which includes these famous words:<br /><br />It matters not how strait the gate,<br />How charged with punishments the scroll,<br />I am the master of my fate:<br />I am the captain of my soul.<br /><br />Mandela faced perhaps even more formidable challenges upon becoming the first post-Apartheid president of South Africa than he had trying to end Apartheid -- how does one manage this kind of change, this kind of forgiveness, this kind of reconciliation?  Perhaps the most important scene in the film for me was the one in which Mandela discusses with Francois Pienaar, the South African rugby team's captain, what kind of leadership philosophy one needs to have, particularly when faced with a seemingly hopeless task that most have written off as unobtainable.  Leadership by example is important here; courage in the face of adversity and perseverance even as all appear negative is also key.<br /><br />Mandela is played admirably by Morgan Freeman; Freeman has been a friend to Mandela for many years, and even so found the role daunting.  How does one portray a living legend?  Francois Pienaar is played by Matt Damon; Damon recounts in press information for the film his meeting with Pienaar, and how Pienaar, an actual rugby player, is so much larger physically than Damon (who, despite his athletic build, is of a more average size).  Clint Eastwood, now a master film maker, was able through his camera work to disguise this fact -- rugby players in general are larger than average!<br /><br />The rugby scenes are very well done; I saw this film with an audience where most had never been exposed to rugby before, but they had no problem figuring out the basic pattern of play, and so problems with rules and strategies did not become a hindrance.  The political scenes, which could also have the potential of descending into arcana that would lose a non-South African audience, were also well crafted to show important issues without delving into the minutiae of politics that end up being distracting.  The on-field and off-field struggles are juxtaposed, and the film shows how the rugby World Cup helped to bring the divided nation together -- of course, this would be to simplify history far too much, but it was an important step.<br /><br />The victory of the Springboks, with Mandela handing the victory cup to Pienaar, is considered by many to be one of the greatest moments in sports history (the BBC testifies to this, among others).<br /><br />Overall, this is a feel-good film that has important historical and social themes.  The cell on Robben Island, where Mandela spent more than half of his nearly three-decade political imprisonment, was actually used in the film -- an important element that helps show the importance of Mandela's actions, and the power of how what might have been quite legitimate hatred and desire for vengeance had become an even more powerful drive for unity and reconciliation.<br /><br />This is an important film, and worthy of viewing and discussion.  It qualifies as one of the most significant South African films, also, as much of the cast are from South Africa and much of the filming was done at or near the actual venues of this taken-from-true-life film.<br /><br />Ah, if only I were 20 years younger, I'd be out on the rugby pitch tomorrow!ial of descending into arcana that would lose a non-South African audience, were also well crafted to show important issues without delving into the minutiae of politics that end up being distracting.

B001HNE3NO|3.0|This book is ok, but I am surprised by how well it has been reviewed by readers. Generally, when I pick up a book that is dominated by 4 and 5-star reviews on Amazon, I get what I am expecting...an outstanding read.<br /><br />This book, however disappointed. About half way through, I was thankful that it was so short and was looking forward to it being completed. The novel has an original plot and good structure. What it suffers from is the writer's tendency to over-state her point. Often, she iterates the emotional content not twice but three times, beating her reader over the head with the point she wants us to take away.<br /><br />I suspect that the overwhelmingly positive reviews stem from the fact that so few people really are aware of the Vel D'Hiv round up of Jews or the French complicity under Nazi occupation.
B002KQ6BT6|5.0|kept u on the edge of your seat for most of the book. however it could have ended sooner
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|I thoroughly enjoyed The Lost Symbol. This book was reviewed rather harshly, I believe. It's not great literary fiction, but then you don't pick up Dan Brown expecting A.S. Byatt. It's a brisk and enjoyable read and makes me want to visit Washington D.C. again. Overall, I would say that this novel is not as good as The DaVinci Code but better than Angels and Demons. Pick this one up and enjoy!
B002HNA95E|4.0|Even if you've collected Madonna's entire library over the years, you might find yourself wanting to pick up Celebration because it includes some edits and remasters that can't be found on album versions.  It also includes the fun new tracks \\"Celebration\\" and \\"Revolver\\" both of which are excellent.<br /><br />If you can live without the remastering and a few new versions, you might want to skip this album all together though.  Madonna's lengthy career spans more than 2 discs, and frankly they've missed out too many classics.  Her DVD [[ASIN:B002JM1VJG Celebration: The Video Collection]], however, is an amazing release that is much more of a true greatest hits collection, especially since it would be an injustice to not consider her unprecedented music videos over her career.<br /><br />Overall, a great gift for the casual Madonna fan, or a must-have for the hardcore fanatic!
044654146X|4.0|Dan Senor and Saul Singer skillfully bring to light Israel's national ethos to explain how Israel has managed to achieve the highest density of start-ups in the world, in spite of its precarious beginnings, its small size, and its isolation from its neighbors for well-known reasons.  Israel specializes in what Messrs. Senor and Singer call high-growth entrepreneurship, i.e., start-ups that reengineer entire global industries.  As the authors demonstrate convincingly, the Israeli high-tech business success story lies not only in the presence of the institutional elements that underpin classic business clusters, but also, and more importantly, in the key components of its cultural core.  Many Israelis display a mixture of seemingly contradictory attitudes which can be baffling to anyone unfamiliar with Israel's national ethos: simultaneously both driven and flat and both ambitious and collectivist.  The IDF (Israel Defense Forces) plays a key role in inculcating specific societal norms into the young men and women who do their mandatory military service.  Messrs. Senor and Singer summarize this ethos very well when they write: \\"it is a story not just of talent but of tenacity, of insatiable questioning of authority, of determined informality, combined with a unique attitude toward failure, teamwork, mission, risk, and cross-disciplinary creativity.\\"  To their credit, the authors do not gloss over the weaknesses of the Israeli economy such as the mixed performance of its other industries and the low Israeli workforce participation chiefly attributable to Haredim (ultra-Orthodox Jews) and Israeli Arabs.  Messrs. Senor and Singer usually explain clearly what different countries such as the United States, Singapore, Finland, and the states of the Gulf Cooperation Council can learn from the Start-Up Nation.  However, these countries should keep in mind that, like emulating a successful company with a distinctive corporate culture, copying \\"High-Tech Israel Inc.\\" will be challenging.  Just recycling bits and pieces of that model will often end in failure.  To summarize, Messrs. Senor and Singer usually succeed in giving their audience an impartial view of the strengths and weaknesses of the Start-Up Nation.challenging.

0061914177|4.0|I've been following Gary for a while now. I was pumped when I found out he was coming out with a book. But then I started reading the negative reviews about how it's all fluff and doesn't give you anything new. I'll be honest my thunder was severely dampened, so I put off reading it.     Well, I decided to check it out myself over the weekend and I have to say I was pleasantly surprised. I think the naysayers have a point that Crush It doesn't provide anything new for people who have been in the web game for awhile now. I'm pretty sure people who bought this book have been following Gary for some time now and know all about Twitter, Tumbler, Wordpress, and Facebook. So the sections weren't very helpful to me. If you're a complete newb to the social media game, then it's a great primer.     With that said, what Crush It has to offer is motivation and enthusiasm. After reading it, I wanted to get to work helping people that follow my site. I started interacting with people more, answered emails faster, posted useful stuff on Facebook. In short, I started to care more.     If you're looking for a kick in the pants to take your business to the next level, read this book.
B001PPGKRG|5.0|I really enjoyed this first complete recording of Handel's 16 keyboard suites. Great music, among which Handel's OWN 'Handel variations', that sounds most beautiful on a Steinway, here masterfully played on by Ragna Schirmer. Her interpretation is playful, exciting and extraordinarily accurate, with every single note being hearable, and never a dull moment. Highly recommended!
1439110123|5.0|One of the most thought-provoking, engaging, and enjoyable reads I've ever had. A comprehensive tracing of petroleum's path from potential home lighting fuel to indispensable energy source and geopolitical instrument. Includes profiles of the colorful personalities that have shaped oil's history and their motivations. I found it very difficult to put down.

B002KQ6BT6|3.0|I enjoy Dan Brown because he is, generally, a mental escape from my \\"work reading\\" and such.  His formulae is consistant and predictable, but generally veiled better than in The Lost Symbol.  Over half of the book replayed the same scene from a different character's perspective, adding tidbits and subplots throughout.  The pace of advancement for the storyline seemed lacking; so much so that I began counting down chapters to the end.  The large plot twist was predicted by me to my husband within the first 40 chapters (there are 132).  The book is sub-par for Brown, but if you need to read something to keep your mind of your flight's three hour weather delay, it will do nicely.
B000000WA4|5.0|This might sound cliche, but Mellon Collie changed my life. By the end of \\"Twilight to Starlight\\" I had laughed, cried, daydreamed, reminisced about childhood memories and friends...No other album has had the same affect on me as this has. I am truly thankful that I found this album. I've known about the Pumpkins since I was 10 (around '97) and I had heard singles from Mellon Collie like \\"Tonight, Tonight\\" and \\"Thirty-Three\\", but for some reason the singles themselves didn't have the same affect on me than listening to these songs in the context of the full album. This album took me on a ride...and I never want to get off. If you don't have it already, buy this album as soon as possible! No matter how many times I listen to it, I never get tired of it. There's always something new! Mellon Collie and the Infinite Sadness is my favorite album next to Black Sails in the Sunset by AFI.
B001993Y2C|2.0|The two stars are for the DVD quality.  Both the audio & video is great.  BUT, and it's a big but, the packaging is horrendous.<br /><br />To start with, the box is so big it will not fit on any shelf in my home.  The boxes that the individual seasons come in are flimsy and the folded cardboard that holds the DVDs came apart for two of the seasons.  Getting individual DVDs out of the box is quite difficult unless you don't care about getting fingerprints all over the DVD. There is no documentation whatsoever.  Not even a Episode guide.  You have to load each DVD to see what is on it.<br /><br />And, as far as the Cylon figure, several joints don't move at all so it won't stand.  I guess mine is a dead Cylon.<br /><br />I wish I had simply paid a little extra to get the individual seasons  so the DVDs would be protected and I would be able to find the episode I want to see.
B001ILFUD2|5.0|I bought this DVD for my boyfriend for Christmas. It arrived quickly and in great shape! He loves it and we just watched it last night. I am very satisfied with this product!
1400064287|5.0|Made to Stick gives so many inspiring example of how you can create effective message. The book itself is \\"sticky\\", too. It's very easy to understand and apply to your work, no matter what it is. I'd recommend this book to anyone.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|I saw this movie in 3D Imax and it was great! I intend to buy the movie as soon as it is available! Very cool sci-fi movie with great plot line and lots of fun with the alien world! Just super all around!
B002SJIO4A|2.0|I've read a number of glowing reviews on this movie, and have to wonder where the scifi genre is headed. It appears to me the movie was created and presented solely as a shock movie, rather than the more conventional \\"story based\\" movie. It is evident from the very beginning you are in South Africa, and are destined to stay there. The \\"news commentary format\\" left this viewer cold, and the Apartheid innuendo throughout felt forced. Perhaps I, as the viewer, just doesn't want to be reminded of(make that force fed) an infamous part of history yet again! Yes, this movie seems targeted towards a narrowly defined type of viewer...I just don't happen to fit into that category.    To be fair, there were a number of scenes near the end where you could genuinely feel sympathy for the two principal characters and had a feeling of a story emerging, but it came a bit too late for overall effective story telling...
0765348276|5.0|This is the story of John Perry and his enlistment into the Colonial Defense Force.<br />The CDF's mission is to protect Earth and all other human colonies in the galaxy.<br />In this first book you follow John through his basic training and subsequent battles that he and his fellow CDF soldiers fight against alien forces bent on human destruction\consumption.<br />This book is a serious page turner!!! I loved it!!
B002T921DE|5.0|I've been a George Michael fan since day 1.  I own and actively listen to all of his (sparse) catalog.  With that said, I also own a lot of concerts on DVD and Blu-ray.  Only a few get me really pumped up, like being right there at the concert.  This is one of them.  While many of the artists who have been around for 25+ years need some help on tour, George still sounds the same.  His muscial arranger, Cris Cameron, has been with him since \\"Faith\\" so the music really sounds true to the studio albums.   The documentary \\"I'd Know Him a Mile Off\\" is a peek into the background scenes of the tour.  Very interesting and laugh-out-loud funny at times.  The documentary really shows how huge of a superstar George is in Europe.  The technical aspects of this Blu-ray are better than others I own. The Hidef video is superb. The special effects of the production are relayed in all their glory. The LED backdrop is like nothing I've seen before. Unlike a couple of other reviewers I found the sound to be excellent in DTS. High volume came through clear and undistorted. Other Bluray concerts have suffered from this but not this one.
B001KVZ6F2|5.0|After all these years Clint Eastwood can still deliver an excellent performance!! This movie will touch you heart!! If it doesn't you don't have one!!!
B002SAEP5G|4.0|The formula is the classic; someone is being \\"alienated.\\" Naturally someone wants to put a \\"bug\\" in your ear as to which the person(s) is/are. Time is running out to find out what the problem is and how to correct it. As always the first to go is the authorities.<br /><br />All right you have seen it a million times and even the characters in the movie refer to \\"Invasion of the Body Snatchers\\" (1956) [see my review] and \\"The Puppet Masters\\" (1994). However it is not the plot but the carrying out of the plot or action that makes the movie. I was amazed to find this movie so professionally portrayed in the era of ersatz teenybopper knockoffs like \\"Sleepy Hollow\\"<br /><br />The characters were well chosen to portray the different Faculty and student types.<br /><br />Where have we seen Coach Willis (Robert Patrick) before? Can you say \\"Terminator Two\\"?<br /><br />Laura Harris is from Canada and this is Ohio so what doses that make her? (An Al...)<br /><br />You can not beat the descriptive names given to the characters.<br /><br />The movie is just down right fun and has a lot of \\"Don't do that\\" scenes makes you want to kibitz.
0452289963|4.0|*I highly recommend this book if you want to maximize your well-being.<br />*Though Eckhart Tolle has a lot of absurd New Age ideas shaping his worldview, his advice as to how one should live one's life is amazing.<br />*The main idea of the book is that we tend to mistakenly identify ourselves with our fleeting, shifting thoughts and emotions, while the only unchanging thing about ourselves, our \\"real self\\" is made of pure, naked, content-free awareness.
B000ZELISO|5.0|Harry and his friends are just a tad older in this movie. Dumbledore turns up inconveniently to spoil Harry's night out with a waitress. This sets up the beginning of a series of frustrating moments for Harry. While Dumbledore's primary mission is to defeat he who must not be named, Harry and his companions must deal with unrequited love.<br /><br />I will not go into all the details due to the fact that it is fun to see them unfold as the movie progresses. However, I would say this movie has more spellbinding and snogging.<br /><br />In the ongoing conflicts between book and movie we have consistently seen these movies could be, just a shadow the book in this movie is no different. Yet once again, Helena Bonham Carter plays a perfect Bellatrix.<br /><br />However, after the second viewing of this movie you will notice that it is consistent and logical. The clues are all there setting you up for the future action. In addition, there is not a wasted scene or word.<br /><br />I've actually seen this movie in the theater with popcorn and nachos. However, I suggest that you look at the Blu-Ray version and do not miss the extra DVD features. The main feature which is maximum movie mode is a little frustrating at first, as it requires you to press buttons and pay attention to the whole movie again. However once you get used to this feature you find that it does add to the viewers understanding of what they are trying to accomplish in the short time available for this movie.<br /><br />For those viewers that are inclined to play with technology more than just being a passive viewer this Blu-Ray version also has a BD-live feature. I personally do not find this very useful.
0684857219|5.0|I read the reviews of people that say this book is a waste and I wonder how they approach their workouts and live there lives. One person complains my body was breaking down from 100 minutes of exercise! Come on people, a little over an hour and a half a day and your complaining your body is breaking down. This book is an excellent source for weight training, it comes from a man who was and arguably still is the best Bodybuilder that has walked the planet. Exercising is about learning what works for you with weights, aerobics, diet etc. and this is an great reference book for just these things.  Over 300 reviews on the book while I'm typing this so it must be doing something good for people. Do yourself a favor and buy the book and I guarantee you'll learn something you never new before no matter how long you've been working out.
0439597404|5.0|The book is the first of five books that constitute one story that is divided up in to bite size books that again are divided up in to bite size chapters. Be sure to read all the periphery notes and charts left in the book. And if you are reading out loud to someone you may want to show them the pictures.<br /><br />The author really knows how to write creepy stories. It makes you want to sleep with one eye open. There is nothing cutesy yet on the other hand there is not violence for violence sake. The story just squeezes into the realm of possibilities. However it takes an evil mind to write these chronicles. One good advantage is that they are short and to the point enough to holds your attention and then be over before you realized what happened.<br /><br />Three children (Mallory, Jared and their younger brother, Simon) and their mother move in to a new home (O.K. shack... O.K. more like several shacks staked on top of each other.) There they find strange noises in the walls. Perusing the source of the noises and with the use of a dumbwaiter they locate a secret library and you guessed it a riddle that may lead to \\"The Field Guide.\\" There is an out write warning that if they find it to get rid of it. However the story is fascinating. All of this comes at a price. I do not want to elaborate but if you have long hair or a suspicious mother then I suggest you read with caution.
B000FA5QEK|1.0|From seeing so many 5-star reviews of this book (and being on the bestseller list for so long), I was waiting to experience some epiphany of enlightenment. Yet after reading this book (you can finish in a day uninterrupted...very short), I just felt like I was conned out of my money.<br /><br />Kiyosaki has successfully followed the formula for every other late-night 3:00am infomercial snake-oil salesman...his \\"teaching\\" you how to become \\"rich\\" has made him all his money rather than applying what he advocates in his \\"book\\" (i.e. printed infomercial).<br /><br />Let me save you the trouble of wasting your money: the key take-away he repeats over and over is to (1) don't buy a house bigger than you need and (2) save your money (duh!) and invest in things that generate additional income.  He makes passing mention of financial investments (stocks, bonds, etc), but his big 'secret' was flipping properties he bought from distressed sellers.  I'm sure that'll work great in today's economy...NOT.<br /><br />Even the stock/bond investments he mentions as his personal examples involve essentially random purchases where he just got lucky and they went up.  It doesn't take an \\"instructional\\" book to tell you to do that.<br /><br />If you want to learn the \\"Rich Dad\\" secret...just do what's common sense: don't spend into debt and save your money.  Take the money you save and invest in assets that generate more money. There...the whole book in one sentence.
B001RQ9QQ0|5.0|Hitler must ultimately decide what threats are real and when.  He relies on the one man he knows can accomplish the task of finding out the truth.

Any that do do not live to tell about it.<br /><br />First, they have to believe that he actually exists.  Then they have to find him.  It they can find him, can they stop him?<br /><br />Yes, the story is intriguing.  Yet it is the people interaction (loyalty, love, and credibility) and the attitude of \\"The Needle\\" that make the story.  Ultimately, the question is \\"Will he succeed and what effect will this have on future generations of those who knew him?\\"<br /><br />[[ASIN:B000035P5E Eye of the Needle]]
B002KQ6BT6|3.0|Dan Brown's latest would've gotten more stars had he cut out about 150 pages or so.  I expected this to have the same \\"formula\\" as \\"The Da Vinci Code\\" and \\"Angels and Demons\\", and indeed it does.  The usual copious references to all the research Brown has done is again evident throughout the book.  If the reader is not a fan of Brown's dismissal of Christianity, then this is not the book for him/her!  However, from the standpoint of fiction/entertainment, it was a pretty good holiday read. It goes pretty quickly, as you'll find yourself skimming quickly through some of the chapters since a lot of the storyline is somewhat predictable in many places. In hindsight, I probably would've borrowed it from someone to read through it instead of the paying $10 to get on the Kindle...or just wait for the DVD of the movie to come out...
B0001HLVSC|3.0|This is modern day interpretation of the swashbucklers staring men like Errol Flynn or Douglas Fairbanks.  Anyone who might be wavering about their feelings about \\"Master and Commander\\" needs to watch some of the older sailing epics and then decide upon their feelings about this one.<br /><br />I thought this production was very pleasant to view.  Wonderful filming, great casting, magnificent sets and the attention to detail was fantastic.  I can't figure out what was missing (for me) because I didn't find it to be as exciting and moving as the majority of reviewers have reported.  With all I mentioned above (the good features), I still found the film flat, almost to the point of being boring.<br /><br />So many reviewers have agreed that multiple viewings are necessary before positive feeling develop.  Well, it's now in my DVD Collection and have it to watch it again, anytime I want.  I'll submit an updating of my feelings if they change.  Hahahahahaha...  I bet you can hardly wait for that...
B001GKJ2FM|4.0|I've always known Meryl Streep was a great actress, but this film reveals a view of her I'd never seen. She was funny, could sing, was energetic, really was believeable in a part that I'd never have thought she would even consider. She seemed to be having a ball through the whole thing--I'm glad she had the opportunity to do this. It may open up a whole new level of movies for her to do! For a \\"chick film\\" this was fun, and the music and scenery and the very predictable story made it a fun thing to be in the midst of. I went with my daughter and granddaughter, and we all laughed all the way through.
B00003CXIY|5.0|Let me start by saying I am not much of a teen movie fan. Road Trip is one of my most favorite comedies. Unlike some comedies it has a solid story and a mixture of personalities. Each contribute to the story to make it one hiliarious classic tale. I started laughing right from the start and did not stop until the end. It is the perfect Road Trip of all time. A must see.
B000GFLE1S|5.0|Kinky boots appealed to me because I love fashion, and enjoy a movie that takes on unconventional, political views.  My dad of 84 loved it as well as all my friends (ages 25-45).  SEE THIS MOVIE & FEEL INSPIRED!
B002SJIO5E|1.0|Really? Seriously? This movie was made for millions and there are people dying in the streets in the US. Millions of people cannot afford adequate healthcare and this movie wasted millions of dollars. wtf? If I could, I would sue for the loss of the two hrs it took to watch this drivel and do something really useful with the money. The only reason I rented it was for the GOW III demo, so at least the disc is more than just a coaster.  Oh well, to each his own.
B001KMB6X2|5.0|Babylon A.D. is a pretty good action movie, but please, don't expect a compelling, thought-provoking storyline of any sorts, haha.      This is just your typical gimmicky Hollywood action movie.  These kind of movies actually hold a special place in my collection of films.  Why?  Because despite the overall and obvious cheese factor of the entire film, these kind of movies actually never get boring to me.  You expect cheese, you get cheese.      The storyline takes Vin Diesel, Michelle Yeoh, and Melanie Thierry all around the northern areas of Asia, such as Mongolia, Kazakhstan, and Russia.    It's about Vin Diesel's character protecting a young hottie (Melanie Thierry's character, who just so happened to be born exactly 10 days after I was back in 1981) and eventually taking her back to New York City where the story concludes.    Once back in America, this is when the shooting and violence REALLY goes up, giving the film a nice slice of solid action.   Melanie Thierry plays a nice role, and throughout the film you constantly wonder what makes her so unique.    It's Vin Diesel- don't expect brilliance.  Just expect an hour and a half of Hollywood action storytelling and make believe violence, and then you'll be able to enjoy the movie better.
B0013XW2F4|1.0|I love the Sherlock Holmes mysteries and have enjoyed many a bedtime story with the great sleuth, so it was with great anticipation that I purchased the Kindle version of this volume of short stories.  I was sadly disappointed, though, to find that apparently the publishers did not understand the audience that buys short story collections; they did not bother to include something most basic and needful in an anthology - a table of contents.  Without a table of contents the reader has no choice but to start at page one and hit \\"Next Page\\" hundreds of times to access stories further into the volume.  This is a ridiculous oversight that completely ruins the experience of picking up a good collection of short stories and choosing a story to read at a whim based on the title.  If one cannot see all of the titles in an included table of contents, then one is forced to start at the beginning and read them all chronologically.  This may work in a novel, but it decidely does not work as a format for a collection of short stories.  Please actually keep the reader in mind the next time that you publish a Kindle version of short stories.  Include a table of contents.
B00260HH3K|1.0|Oh Please, Dragonball? This is an insult to every dragonball fan there ever was or ever will be.   That is like a whole bunch of people asking if they could have a brand new car & you give them a bucket, that would be an insult & a disgrace! This is what this movie has done.
B002GU5V24|5.0|Let me inform you that maybe one of the best Genesis live CDs for many people, SECONDS OUT, unfortunately could have two big recording defects in this USA edition until all Boxes were replace. But now, Rhino Records began to send discs replacement as request for the people who have the GENESIS LIVE BOX with defects on both SECONDS OUT CDs. The defects are two glitches exactly at the begining of track N° 2 of each disc. So, if you have that problems, you only have to send an e-mail to Dr Rhino and they will ship you both discs replacement. I have a GENESIS LIVE BOX that came with that defects, so I wrote to Rhino and they finally responded sending me both replacements. Many thanks for everybody, don´t worry and remember that life is too short to take it seriously!!!.
B000OIMRKE|5.0|When you add this one to it. We've all heard it mentioned about many musicians \\"debut\\" as being their best. A very, very good first album by Dire Straits, written by Mark Knopfler. If you get the CD...Put it this way \\"You won't be skipping tracks\\". Would you want to add a bunch of \\"Filler Crap\\" to a great jam like \\"Sultans\\". Bottom line...If you like warm,cleanly recorded, well written and just plain excellent music.....Welcome. Almost 32 years old and a truly timeless album. If you're a fan of J.J. Cale, Eric Clapton, or Dylan...you'll love this one. A \\"Must own\\" and a for sure \\"No brainer\\"
B001P22HK8|4.0|First of all, I liked the book, and look forward to other books by the author.  When the sequel is available on the Kindle, I'll buy it.  Daemon was entertaining and substantive, although the ending was abrupt.<br /><br />That said, this book very much felt like a better-informed but less well-written Snow Crash with a touch of the Matrix.  The author didn't make as many technical mistakes as Stephenson, but his influences were apparent.  Of course, it's tough to write a cyberpunk novel involving virtual worlds without running into Neuromancer or Snow Crash, but once you throw in a motorcycle chase at the end, it's a little gratuitous.  Stephenson's a bit more naturalistic, if you can say that about a post-modernist.  The dialog in Daemon is a bit stilted and awkward feeling, but it's not so bad as to be pulpy.<br /><br />The small-scale technical mistakes were small, and not nearly enough to make me feel like ranting at the author.  I think they were more a case of stretching outside his area of expertise and being too precise, a lesson I think Pynchon taught us in his foreword to \\"Slow Learner\\".  He also obviously attempted to shorten the narrative by having senior government officials and military officers know about object code, APIs, and how to pronounce the title of the book.  I thank his editor for not letting him go into long descriptions of acronyms, abbreviations, and technical terms, because I probably would have had to skip whole sections of the book.<br /><br />Without the technical exegeses, however, I'm not sure I can recommend it to people who a) aren't extremely computer literate, b) didn't go to university between, say, 1988 and 1998, and c) have not had some exposure to computer and/or network security.  This is definitely spun towards the pre-web or cracker technologist.  Then again, maybe more people are using IRC today than I think.<br /><br />The larger scale technical issues are those things you just have to go with in the same way you might watch a James Bond film.  OK, there's a super-genius villain, it's just possible that maybe he could invent things that are really, really, really, really difficult but brittle, and are capable of executing massively coordinated plans with no intervention.  I suspect the sequel will exploit this.here's a super-genius villain, it's just possible that maybe he could invent things that are really, really, really, really difficult but brittle, and are capable of executing massively coordinated plans with no intervention.

B000X5SPBI|5.0|I am a HUGE fan of Supernatural, I think it is the best show on television. I love \\"My Boys\\" and the acting and characters are amazing. Not only is there eye candy for girls, but plenty of action and scares for everyone. I got seasons 1-4 for Christmas, and I LOVE them!
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I'd heard this was terrific, but it's so much more than that.  My husband, son and I were mesmerized watching it, it was just so good.  To see these three great, music-defining guitarists together, to see them riff together and enjoy each OTHER's contributions to music, to hear their own philosophy on music and where the music comes from for them (and it's totally different for each of them!) was an incredibly pleasurable experience.  I loved watching one of them take off on a piece of music, and you could see the other two intently watching what he was doing, copying it and then twisting it in their own style, and yet - they harmonized so beautifully together!   We loved it, absolutely loved it.  I'm glad we own it, we will be watching it again.

B0013N3DSE|5.0|This is one of the greatest films of all time, folks.  I don't know if I've ever seen such cast camaraderie in a film cast before (the only other occurrence that comes to mind is \\"Rio Bravo\\" with John Wayne, Dean Martin, Rick Nelson, Angie Dickenson, and Walter Brennen).  It permeates through this film and it is one of the reasons that this film in particular has become a classic and probably one of the top ten best movies of all time.  It is beautifully shot, perfectly acted, and the score is gorgeous.  If you are a fan of cinema, this belongs in your collection, especially on blu-ray.  I will admit that I do like the Costner version as a guilty pleasure, but THIS is the cornerstone, the truest representation of Robin Hood on film.      **Postscript**  Also recommended as a sequel to this film is \\"Robin & Marian\\" with Sean Connery and Audrey Hepburn.  Trust me.

B0011KQSZ4|5.0|I am shocked that any reviewer has rated this movie with less than a three.  Although some parts might be considered predictable it just doesn't matter as it is an incredibly funny movie.  If you love some of these movies: Thank You for Smoking, Young Frankenstein, High Anxiety, as I do chances are good you will love this one.  Enjoy!
B001AQO3WY|2.0|When i bought this show, I was under the impression that HBO consistently produces quality television shows, I was wrong. I thought this show had an good idea with theme and such, and it was well shot. but it was really corny and not well written. which is a shame because i am a huge fan of The Wire, and I thought that was written extremely well. so, in conclusion, I thought this show was not good overall.
B002PMV9K6|2.0|I haven't read any of the Harry Potter books, but I thought the original movie was uniquely wonderful.  Like countless others, I was enchanted by its masterful realization of rich archetypal symbolism drawn from a combination of classic British culture and the world of magic.  It was a movie that simply had to be made.<br /><br />But the subsequent movies have merely attempted to recycle the ingredients from the original, letting them become increasingly stale in the process while adding no worthwhile new elements.  Moreover, instead of being buoyantly magical, the movies have become rather dark, not just in their plot and characters, but even visually, with the original vivid colors now looking faded as though all the events took place at dusk.<br /><br />This latest movie exemplifies these weaknesses.  The characters are now stereotyped and flat, the plot is unconvincing and doesn't go anywhere interesting, and the overall emotional range is stunted and narrow.  If they wanted to give up on making a good movie and instead just cash in on their lucrative franchise by resorting to fear and cool special effects, they didn't even accomplish that.  The special effects fell short of the previous movies (lowering cost to increase profit?) and boredom was the main effect I experienced.  I had to struggle just to stay awake.  In a word, this movie was drab.<br /><br />I can't recommend this movie even for mindless entertainment, and I won't be watching the next one unless they somehow get their act together and garner rave reviews.

B00026WUAU|1.0|You can tell by how Dylan's personal life was in total chaos, as well as dealing with drug addiction and Methodone.<br />In his weakened, painful, drug mared state, he was at his weakest, in the lowest ebb of his life. So low, with a failed marriage, and dealing with drug issues that his self-esteem was at such a low point, he desperatley got involved with a group of born again Christians.<br />Being told what he should do and feel and being so exclusive to the world, as a \\"born again\\" Christian, was not exactly what would be attractive to this magnificent,creative, innovative and critical thinker. Dylan has open millions of minds and rather than having anything with and inclusive type of group, was very inclusive to all and all people from different races, religions, etc, could hear something that would move their being and open up a personal search of their own.<br /><br />What is most striking about this album, that is of low standards by really any artist of any success, was the total lack of feeling and emotion in it. He was at a low point in his life, giving up on personal hopes and dreams and this terribly uninspired work, that was needed  to fulfill contract obligations might have been looked at as terrible sad.<br /><br />Fortunately Dylan recovered from his drug issues, got his \\"mojo\\", back with a vengeance, fortunately dropped the \\"born again\\" gang and and has created some incredible music again, has a terrific radio show on BBC and wrote the first of Dylan's fantastic Chronicles, which was a finalist for a Pulitzer.  He is also touring almost non-stop, healthy, happy and attending Jewish services, as seen in New York.<br /><br />So this dreary album, that has no spark or even a song worth mentioning, is to be of interest to curiosity seekers only, as it is one that doesn't represent Dylan or his work.<br /><br />I personally am thrilled that this energy less, sad album, represented a personal bottom for Dylan, who after recovering, has had a creative explosion in some great inspired work in music and writing.<br /><br />It isn't good as all and I recommend that people pass on it, unless someone is such a Dylan fan (as I am), and wants to hear it as a sort of collectors or curiosity piece.<br /><br />Jon
B000E41MS6|5.0|While the series is a bit wobbly on its pins starting out, that's forgiveable and even enjoyable when returning to watch it later. A delightful reimagining of a wonderful British character, this first season of new Who is definitely worth trying to get a copy of.
0743243153|5.0|I read this book for the first time 10 years ago and I just reread it.  I will not wait ten years to read it again. The Road Less Traveled is without a doubt one of the best books ever written.  If everyone read this book, and had enough insight to understand Peck's information, the world would be a better place.  Each time I read it, I become focused on being a better person.   If you are contemplating this purchase- you should buy the book- it will not disappoint you!
0385504225|4.0|It doesn't quite meet the high standards set by my favorite, \\"Angels & Demons,\\" but it's a fun and suspenseful read. Definitely recommend it.
B002H3F7F6|4.0|I received both the CD and the DVD for Christmas.  I'm a big Sting fan, but that doesn't mean that I've liked everything he has put out.  So, I really wasn't expecting much from the winter album, as I've always preferred his main-stream music to his \\"musical exploration\\" type albums, like Sacred Love.  I listed to the winter CD first.  I thought that the songs were ok, but mainly just interpretive versions of some of his original great songs, and nothing spectacular.  So I basically wasn't impressed.  BUT, then I watched the DVD.  Wow, what a difference.  First of all, you see the setting, the artists, and their instruments.  And suddenly, just ok becomes outstanding.  It's hard to describe the difference, but it was a huge one for me.  It gives you a much better appreciation for Sting (and the other artist's) abilities.  I highly recommend you buy the DVD version over the CD, or both, but not the CD by itself.  Treat yourself to the whole experience by watching the DVD and you'll be pleased.  I plan on watching it every year around Christmas time (even though he is an agnostic, and not much of a \\"reason for the season\\" kind of guy) and start a new tradition.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|I was going to see this movie when it hit the theaters.  I even participated in the Demand It promotion on the movie's website because in the beginning it wasn't showing in El Paso but it started showing in the city rather quickly but then I started reading the reviews on Yahoo movies and quickly changed my mind.  I told myself that I rather wait until it came out on DVD because I knew based on the ratings it wouldn't stay in the theaters that long and let me TELL YOU...I'm so glad that I went with my gut feeling!  The DVD wasn't completely terrible but it wasn't that great.  I know the movie was made with about $12,000 but I thought it would at least be somewhat scary!  The last 15 minutes was the scariest.  I'm thinking that was the part that was shown in the previews!  I'm so glad that I didn't waste my money and believe the hype!  This movie was definitely over marketed and the consumers were robbed while the studio is laughing all the way to the bank!  While watching the DVD, I definitely had to use my imagination because there wasn't anything scary but several creepy noises and loud bangs.  The last 15 minutes was the creepiest.  The movie could have been done in less than 30 minutes.  There are no special features on the DVD.  I'm giving it 3 stars for effort but seriously it doesn't even really deserve that!  How are these people on Amazon giving this movie 5 stars?  I also didn't understand how the movie got beyond a C- rating on Yahoo.  I guess some people like watered down horror flicks or really don't get out much lol.<br /><br />And one more thing....why is this movie rated R?  It was more like watching a PG13 rating because of the language!
0393317552|3.0|I was just about to attempt to write something that hadn't been written, but I see that is out of the question.  The author, Diamond, is obviously very knowledgeable in his field of study, but it seems that he has attempted to simply write something that hasn't quite been said before.  The result is the opposite of what so many have said regarding European supremacy throughout history, mostly recent history.    Without going any further, I will just allude to Mr. Christopher A. Smith's review.  I don't think it could be said any better.  I am a white American, and I'm not sure I would be able to critique the work as effectively as Mr. Smith, since he notes his race and the fact that he still has a problem with Diamond's approach.  Mr. Diamond's approach is indeed biased.  I'm not faulting the author; I'm sure it would be next to impossible to tackle this subject matter without leaning one way or the other.  At any rate, well said, Mr. Smith.
B002UZCJ8Y|3.0|In the future, people stay safely indoors, while they live their lives through their Surrogates, the robotic images of who they wish they were: young, pretty, and popular.  Surrogates are the brainchild of Dr. Canter (James Cromwell, the go-to guy for genius inventors), but when Canter's son is murdered while hooked up to his Surrogate, the world must face a realization: society is in for yet another change, and this one promises to be a violent one.<br /><br />Bruce Willis, as the cop who tries to get to the source of the problem, turns in a solid performance; as does Cromwell, although he has so little to work with, it's almost a tragedy.  Ving Rhames, as the leader of a group of anti-Surrogate people, is reduced to caricature; a shame, since he's such a great actor.  Rosamund Pike, as Willis's wife (or, rather, her Surrogate, for she is rather addicted to the technology), is so wooden, we can't help but wince; granted, she's playing a robot, but still...<br /><br />\\"Surrogates\\" is based off a graphic novel, and as such I will be reading the novel when I get the chance.  The premise behind the film truly is outstanding; but then, the same could be said about \\"I, Robot,\\" to which this film draws many (unfavorable) comparisons.  In both instances, we have a pretty decent--sometimes great--actor playing the sane man in an insane world, surrounded by friends and loved ones who criticize him for his reliance on the past.  Such concepts contain the promise of social commentary, but \\"Surrogates\\" never quite gets there; instead, it's basically a slam-bang action thriller with an ending you can see coming a mile away, but some interesting special effects and a performance by Bruce Willis that make it worth a viewing or two.
B002SJIO5E|2.0|The proof that I went into this film wanting to like it is evidenced by the fact that I bought the Blu-ray without having ever seen the movie.  I did so purely on the basis of the positive buzz this film has received.  Big mistake.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" is indeed a novel depiction of aliens, as others have said.  Rather than coming to earth as our would-be conquerors or superiors, these aliens are mostly lower-class worker bees who lack the social sophistication you would expect of beings capable of manning, let alone creating, their massive space ship, which remains hovering over the city for decades after their arrival.  These aliens are a ragtag lot on their last leg as they stagger into our world.  After they arrive, they are housed en masse in a slum by their human caretakers, who ultimately must take on a role closer to prison guards.  There the aliens display all of the social unrest and lack of civility you might find in any slum on earth where humans reside.  The problems spill over and begin to negatively affect the local human population, which leads to the decision to relocate the aliens to a refugee camp further from the city.  We follow the human administrator tasked with overseeing this effort as he works his way through the alien slum on what seems to be the ridiculous errand of delivering eviction notices to the aliens in preparation for the move.  What's so absurd about the whole thing is that some of the aliens begin randomly fighting with and even killing members of the human security detail as this vulnerable administrator--depicted as the quintessential office-cubicle nerd--continues to make his rounds on foot.  All the while, he is being videotaped for what appears to be a news report or documentary.  Rather than retreat from what starts to feel like a war zone, the humans just pick up the body parts of their eviscerated comrades and keep up the ridiculous formality of serving eviction notices.  Eventually, a human becomes infected with something the aliens have brought, and we spend the rest of the film following his plight and the reactions of the humans and aliens around him.<br /><br />\\"District 9\\" takes a long time to get rolling, and once it does, it fails to make any meaningful statements about anything.  Set in post-apartheid South Africa, the film pretends to teach lessons about xenophobia and segregation, but the aliens make themselves such unwelcome guests among their human benefactors that they generate zero sympathy from viewers when the humans make what seems to be the very rational decision to relocate them away from the human population.  The reaction by the humans in charge when they discover one of their own has been infected is over-the-top, but if anything, their actions are motivated more by greed or concern for public safety than xenophobia.  About the only thing this film succeeds at is turning cinematic stereotypes about aliens on their ear.  Bottom line is \\"District 9\\" is a long way to go for much less payoff than the hype surrounding this film would suggest.  What little payoff there is largely comes in the form of action once the bullets start flying.<br /><br />I'm somewhat shocked that Peter Jackson was associated with this film at all (he was the producer).  It is nowhere near the level of his earlier \\"Lord of the Rings\\" films or \\"King Kong\\" (all of which he directed).  Much of this $30-million film has a low-budget indy-production feel, in part due to the excessive use of shaky hand-held cameras, which quickly becomes annoying to watch.  There are some high-quality CGI aliens and special effects, but they are not enough to save this film from its lack of character development or a meaningful plot.  As a result, when bad things start to happen to the infected human, we're not so much caught up in the drama of his plight as we are dispassionate observers of the mayhem that ensues.  The film's resolution only raises questions that expose obvious plot holes.<br /><br />If youneed to find out what the buzz surrounding \\"District 9\\" is all about, pay your local video rental store a visit.
1416594787|4.0|I listened to the [...] version of this book.  I also downloaded the reference material (illustrations) provided by Audible.<br /><br />This is a really wonderful book which plainly provides plenty of evidence to support the idea that evolution, as defined by modern science, is how the profusion of life forms we witness today came to be.  Influential people like Dennis Prager and Michael Medved should be required to consume the contents of this book before they utter another word on the subject.  They currently both abandon their excellently evolved minds, and deny, in their \\"Intelligent Design\\" zeal, macro-evolution and natural selection.<br /><br />Really, there is no need for them, or anyone for that matter, to address the question of how a deity fits into the picture.  Dawkins does, unfortunately, get into that question within the book.  He points out some obvious issues that make ID arguments look silly, but he need not have.  He effectively makes the case for the facts of evolution without dragging in the \\"Darwin/ID\\" hassle.<br /><br />The ID crowd are stuck in the doctrines they learned as children and will carry to their graves.  It would be a major step forward for people like Dennis and Michael and the ID crowd to face the facts and the evidence and accept natural-selection evolution regardless of how it all got started.<br /><br />Thank you, Professor Dawkins.
B002SJIO4A|4.0|It's not often that we get a science-fiction movie, and a high-profile one for the big screen, that takes a rather unusual approach. A number of things were unique or at least from the expected - the dynamics of the situation, the aliens and their \\"agenda\\", intentionally de-framing some of the obvious questions one would want to see answered, and things like that (I don't want to spoil the plot for those who haven't seen it yet).    It is not often that I watch a big scifi/action movie and have no idea what is going to happen next. This was the case with D9. I simply couldn't have predicted the twists and turns. It was that outside the box. It is sort of the opposite of watching an episode of TNG where you could see things coming.    Unfortunately what could have been one of the best scifi movies ever was disrupted by what movie executives want to see in movies to bring the masses to the movie theaters - non-stop action, guns, explosions, cool-tech, deaths, etc. And it's not that these should be avoided, but in the case of this movie, they got in the way of what could have made it a very special movie.    One of the other elements that made this movie different is that it just avoided getting in-depth. It's as if they were telling the story from the perspective of someone watching it off a tangent and couldn't keep his hands (no pun intended) from changing the channels on the remote. It was filmed and framed not from the perspective we usually see. Perhaps by design, perhaps not, but it gave it a different feel.    And by doing this they avoided a lot of the cliches that make it hard to take some of the scifi-action blockbuster movies seriously. Other than the shoot-em-ups of course.    If nothing else, this is a must-see movie for its unique approach and storyline.
B00005JKCH|4.0|This flick was decades in the making. So many legal setbacks forced Spider-man to bounce from rights holder to rights holder before finally finding a place with Sony to deliver the goods.<br /><br />The hype surrounding this movie was astounding. I remember getting my copy of the soundtrack before the movie came out, and not just that, but also a copy of the \\"Hero\\" single by Nickelback as well. Seeing Spidey swinging over a gold-bathed New York on its cover got me even more stoked for this film.<br /><br />And so, opening night, I went with my dad to check the movie out, my heart pounding with excitement, the previews before the movie taking excruciatingly long.<br /><br />Peter Parker (Tobey Maguire), geek extraordinaire, gets bitten by a radioactive \\"super spider\\" while on a class fieldtrip as he tries to get a picture for the school paper of next-door-neighbour-slash-love-of-his-life Mary Jane Watson (Kirsten Dunst). Following a bout of sickness, Peter wakes up the next morning no longer a skinny geek but instead buff and tough, wondering what happened to him. Adding to the weirdness, he's suddenly able to do things he wasn't able to do before: no need for glasses; lots of energy; fantastic agility; amazing strength; sticks to walls; shoots sticky white web-things out of his wrists; can sense bad things before they happen. So, like any good teenager with superpowers, he uses them to impress the girl of his dreams, in his case taking on a spider-like persona in a wrestling match to win some big money to buy a car. While on the way there, he fights with his uncle, Ben, and leaves in a huff, only to later find out the burglar he let get away--who had stolen from the wrestling folks who didn't pay him what he was worth--killed his uncle in an effort to swipe a getaway car.<br /><br />Also going on, Norman Osborne (Willem Dafoe) is having trouble with his company and so, in a fit to prove to the military his superhuman formula works so he can sell it to them, he tries it on himself . . . but with dire side effects: the creation of an alternate personality which is eventually dubbed \\"the Green Goblin.\\" When things go sour for the company, the board of directors votes him out and Norman goes into full villain mode to exact his revenge.<br /><br />Across the city, Peter has learned that with great power comes great responsibility and so avenges his uncle's death by using his new spider-like powers for good and becomes the Amazing Spider-man.<br /><br />It's hero versus villain, Spider-man versus the Green Goblin, in this superheroic slugfest/love story/coming-of-age movie that made the wait for this flick well worth it.<br /><br />To be honest, however, the crazy overhype of this movie did put a damper on it for me when I first saw it. Straight up: when I left the theatre opening night I left disappointed. No that I thought it was awful, not by any means, it was just there was this lingering \\"Is that it?\\" feeling that hung over me as I made my way back to the car.<br /><br />If anything, Spider-man is definitely an origin movie, something to set the stage for more to come, giving a rich back story and atmosphere not to just Peter Parker's world, but to each of the supporting characters, even J. Jonah Jameson (who J.K. Simmons played brilliantly, by the way).<br /><br />The effects were top notch save for a couple moments where you clearly saw the Peter that was swinging and jumping from rooftop to rooftop was animated. Speaking of the swinging, when Spidey took you up and down through the deep concrete chasms of New York--man, you felt like you were there, swinging along with him. I heard they even developed a \\"spider-cam\\" for this movie. Cool. And that heartbreaking scene at the end where Peter turns down MJ? My heart bled for the guy.<br /><br />Do I stand by Spider-man? Absolutely. I saw it again in the theatre, going back with the mindset of \\"seeing it for what it was,\\" and I adored it afterward. Out of the three movies in thisseries so far, it's my second favorite. As for my favorite-favorite, just watch my reviews.<br /><br />This was a superhero movie done right, done well and done just plain cool.<br /><br />Recommended.<br /><br />A.P.

B0019I6WDG|4.0|It's not hard to see why the movie \\"Juno\\" became so popular. Ellen Page delivered a great performance as the character of Juno that made this movie what it is. Juno's whole matter of fact and pragmatic approach to life and all the issues she was going through was refreshing and unexpected. This is another movie where you really couldn't see where it was going until it went there.    The rest of the characters were okay to good, although the rich couple felt a little bit not-organic.    From a movie makers perspective, they brilliantly used the runners to both frame and quirkify the movie. It really worked.    The movie also touches upon some serious issues, but does so in an organic and pragmatic way, instead of the typical culture-war histrionics we often see.    My suggestion? Watch this before you watch another formulaic Hollywood dramedy and comedy!
0735619670|5.0|I received this book as a two year gift at the company I am working at from my lead programmer with the explicit task of reading it before the year was up.  After having read it, I've found that this book is valuable not because it contains many revelations, secrets, or obscure concepts that programmers don't already know, but because it provides a solid, practical foundation for all programmers to relate to.  Regardless of whether or not you or your team chooses to subscribe to the teachings within this book, I believe it is valuable for everyone to have a common lexicon for discussion when it comes to coding standards, and I believe this book has the most complete, well thought out, monolithic compilation of these.  I highly recommend every programmer to browse if not purchase this book outright, be you a novice who would like a better understanding of the processes of professional software development, or a veteran who would like a codex of the lessons learned over many years of engineering experience as a reminder and common ground with other senior programmers.
1559409002|5.0|Its Amazing that low budget films like this one can endure the test of time. I truly loved the eerie organ music and don't care what anybody says about it. Those people don't have good taste that discredit the music. You have to be a truly dark arts fans to enjoy it. The plot of the film was pure Aghori. The sect in India that claims we are all dead even though we think we are not. We are the Carnival of Souls!
B002NPUCP8|4.0|First heard of her from \\"This Is It\\" where she really made her mark as a guitar player.  This album could have had more, more guitar.  But, she sings fine too.  Also, she needs more radio 'air' plays!
1400067936|5.0|Nicholas Taleb can be awfully condescending, indeed. The backhanded dismissal of many persons and ideas, sometimes to the point of scoffing, can put off the average reader. E.g., his equating \\"work ethic\\" with \\"inefficient mediocrity\\" (p. 124). Still, persist through all this and get to his quite valuable insights. Even simple, semi-obvious ones like, wealth doesn't contribute as much to well-being as does the path getting there.    He correctly points out that, in spite of most of us knowing better, we easily (and loudly sometimes) see patterns after the fact or event, whereas seeing them before the event would be next to impossible. Almost trivial, except that this behavior poisons far too much thinking. Taleb's logic then extends the point to show that the \\"new\\" is rarely the \\"excellent,\\" and that inventions do not necessarily imply progress. The same applies to information (witness much of the witless journalism). He saw such behavior in his extensive securities trading career, to the usual detriment of his clientele.     There are many references to \\"one case does not prove a point.\\" Also, see an extended discussion of \\"relative anchoring\\" as regards how people value things (section \\"Where is Napoleon When We Need Him,\\" p. 190). A related idea discusses the inverse relationship of self-imposed pressure to happiness (p. 258), an idea with which one could legitimately quarrel.    This excellent book still has things to become irritated over. Taleb often makes \\"so-and-so will be coming/discussed later\\" comments. This device, used effectively, keeps readers glued; used too often, keeps readers annoyed.  Remembering from chapter 4, something talked about in chapter 11 can be hard on the poor soul who didn't write the book! Be aware, too, that the author will use a double negative in a stretched-out sentence sometimes, a tedium sort of like that chapter 11-4 problem just mentioned. Get the book anyway, especially if you are a stock or options trader. You will think five times before doing any more of that stuff. He speaks truly when he tells us that only a small fraction of traders survive, but almost 100% of financial advisers do. Yes.
6305609713|5.0|Got the delivery in good time.  Had to review this movie for a college course and it was not available throught Netflix, delayed disc, so I had to purchase.  Not that it really mattered.  It is a classic and probably would have ended up owning it anyway.
0439023483|5.0|I was expecting a Battle Royale imitation. I was hesitant to read it at first because it is rated for young adults. I left it on my desk for over a week before opening it. I was expecting some kind of insipid, amateur writing and plot. Instead, I was enthralled by the story and could not put it down! The characters are fleshed out and the plot is action-packed. The author introduces a new world without making the plot drag at all. For the first time in a very long time, I really like the heroine. I'm usually exasperated with heroines and their sassy, illogical decisions, but I rooted for Katniss the whole way.<br /><br />Even though I have an aversion to books written in 1st POV, I was very impressed with the characters and the story. I read this book in a day. It is a fantastic read that ends in a cliffhanger. I was a cynic about this book at first, judging it by its category, but now I can't wait to get my hands on the second book.
B000X9PNOG|2.0|I´ve always been a huge Meatloaf fan and I even still like his non-Steinman recordings which never were dull (esp. Midnight at the lost and Found and Blind before I stop - I mean the songs not the album). I´ve seen him twice in the last 5 years, always to my big disappointment. I just couldn´t see him publishing a concert in that low quality of singing he offered when I was in the audience, so I had higher hopes for this disc. But, well, it´s the sad new story: He and his voice are burnt out unable to cope with enormous amount of versatility and range that Steinman-stuff demands. He tries to get away with some acting and putting more \\"expression\\" into his voice, but it sounds stained, he´s off the mark a lot of times, his voice cracks and out of tune. This actually is a sad document of an artist who is not able to live up to his own standards. He should ease-up, go into clubs, with a small band and do it more acoustic. He just can`t hold up against the massive wall of sound anymore. No blame on the band which is excellent and tight. The mixing could´ve been more powerful. And the female leads (yes, pretty) should stick to what Steinman wrote (-he sure still knows better as his refusal to work on the ill-fated (and soundig) BAT III shows).
B001RLP862|1.0|I don't see how these cards can claim to be RARE...they were not just a trial run, they have been in full production for over a year, and you can easily walk into Walmart and find a deck for cheaper than on here.  Not sure how they are crease resistant since when I did buy a pack several cards were already creased when I opened it up.  If you are going to buy these, don't get ripped off by purchasing them on here.
B001SN78JO|4.0|First of all Jim Carrey is an amazing actor he has been my favorite actor since I was Eight years old when I saw Ace Ventura When Nature Calls. This movie is very funny. At first You will find that the story line is bad but don't turn it off it gets much better. He makes a covonent with a preacher type guy to say yes to everything, learn korean yes, take guitar leasons yes, go bunjy jumping yes. The star of this movie is Jim Carrey but Bradly Cooper from the Hangoverand Zooey Deshanel are also in the film. So i Highly recommend it. If you like this film I recommend seeing Ace Ventura and Liar Liar.
B000NA28IE|5.0|I have only seen the movie, never read the book.  So I base this review on that alone.  I loved the fantasy and felt like this movie actually took me there with it.  I would not call it a kid only movie.  Much better than any other movies I've seen in this category.  I was disapointed by it ending and felt like it needed to continue, and then there was never a sequal.  So I probably would prefer the book.  But nothing can replace seeing these beautiful dragons up on the big screen.  And riding them, it's breathtaking for anyone who likes dragons and mystical creatures.  This movie really helps bring them to life with a good story.
B002HWRYJE|4.0|I saw this movie in theaters and i thought it was an incredable movie. The story line is good, the action is great, and the special effects are amazing. I highly recommend this movie even if your not a trecky (star treck fan). Right from the start you will love Captain Kirk. Do not rent this movie buy the movie.
B000GCFY0I|4.0|This book touches subjects that, although harsh now, open the readers eyes to a new way of thinking. Do we really base such a large amount of our opinions of looks? Do we really cut down trees for useless things? Do we really encourage wars over material objects? With a futuristic spin that leaves you wondering more about the way we might live in the future, Uglies is a book that is refreshing and a good read.     It is similar to the book Exodus, as it points out flaws in the way we live now and what effects it might have in the future. It takes a while to get used to the enviroment that the book portrays, but you soon get used to it. Although I feel as if more could be known about the background and childhood of the main characters, it was nice to puzzle things out for youself.    This book offers adventure, romance and a good read.     Jessica, 14
B001GCUO1Q|2.0|When my friend let me borrow this DVD i thought it looked really cool but I was wrong. Overall the movie is Bad. The action is not that great and the story line is not great either this film is very overated.  They hardly show cyclopse, Gambit, or any of the other characters. When i first saw the commercial the voice says \\"im assembling a perfect team.\\" That team did not include Cyclopse or Gambit and the team was only in the movie for the beginning. Do not purchase the movie just rent it.

B002T9H2LA|4.0|Inglourious Basterds was an ok film. It was amusing in it's own twisted way and the scalping can be a turn off for some. There are a lot of Nazi movies out there and this one is pretty good. The only thing i didn't like about the film was it was all subtitiles. I can handle subs usually but it was small and sometimes hard to read. Brad pitt did a good job and his charater was interesting. So all in all it's worth seeing. One of the better Nazi films.
B001GKJ2FC|5.0|I'm an action movie lover. Not all of them make the cut though. Wanted is one movie which doesn't make any pretensions of being a classic movie. Not that there isn't any story line or drama, but it takes second place to the action. And I loved every bit of it. Right to the point of the silly twisting bullets. From the trailers I knew that these scenes were in the movie, so no shock of thinking logic with that. The action scenes deliver, particularly one memorable sequence of a train chase in Romania. I get the chills just thinking about it. Couple it with the high energy score and this movie doesn't disappoint. With a decent receiver, the blu-ray experience delivers with the audio. One interesting point I noticed was when I originally played this movie with a sony sound-bar HDMI audio is that exactly at 13:48 seconds into the movie, it froze. I was able to play Kung-fu Panda with the same sound-bar though, so its peculiar to this disc only. I don't have that issue anymore as I promptly returned it next day for an Onkyo SR606 receiver.
B001U0HBPG|2.0|This shows the narrow line between success and failure in drama. The same writer had a mammoth hit with Forrest Gump. Despite some critical mauling the paying public loved it because the viewer cares about the three major characters right from the start.<br /><br />In Button you have exactly the same three major characters of a man, his mother and his 'girl'.But the viewer never comes to care about the characters. I did not find the film too long - far from it , I was waiting for some of the relationships to be filled out. I was quite happy with the whole idea of a life lived backwards; that is quite an original idea but the writer and director seemed to think that the idea would be enough  for us. They seemed to be saying \\"This is a large scale Hollywood film - we have thrown money, special effects and lots of make-up at this film. Enjoy!\\".<br /><br />The weakest part in the film relates to Button's adoptive mother. She simply disappears onto the cutting room floor along with almost all of the part of her real daughter, Button's sister.What was that all about?<br /><br /> Kate Blanchett plays the life out of Button's love but we do not understand her fascination for him and early in the film this is very creepy.It is quite inconceivable that her daughter would not have been told all about her bizarre father repeatedly through her life, rather than finding out the truth at her mother's death bed. Scenes to which Hurricane Katrina has been added for no reason whatsoever.<br /><br />Brad Pitt plays Button with great reserve. Worked for Hanks in 'Gump', leaves us cold here. The narrow line between success and failure is defined by the plot and script.We are asked to believe that Button abandons the love of his life so she will not see him 'grow young'. Not anyone's idea of true love. The episodes in Button's life; the endless tugboat scenes, the pointless Tilda Swinton scenes in Russia are never remotely engaging. Maybe Roth thought that the post Vietnam war Shrimp Boat scenes in Gump could be replicated. Mentioning Vietnam reminds me that the success of Gump was in getting the audience to come to terms with American history over 40 years from the 1950s. Button takes a similar broad brush to the history of the world from 1917 to the 1960s but this history is never connected to the story and sometimes the settings look decidedly wrong. Did New Orleans really have happy race relations between the 2 World Wars??<br /><br />So, sorry Oscars, this is a bit of a clunker. Why not try a Director's Cut;see if we can get involved a bit...ated.

B002T9H2L0|5.0|Quentin Tarantino hit this one out of the park.  We picked this up to watch with friends and before we started watching it, I cringed when I learned that one of these friends was squeamish when it comes to Tarantino films, but to her credit she was willing to give it a viewing.<br /><br />Chapter One (worth the price of the DVD) sucked in the group of us with riveting performances, dialog, and cinematography.  It set the tone for the rest of the film.<br /><br />I know a lot of other viewers dinged the film slightly for Quentin's little idiosyncrasies.  That doesn't bother me a bit, in fact I've come to expect them.  They're just his way of putting his stamp on the film.<br /><br />What was most striking to me, was the fact that Tranantino is perfecting (given the right story) his craft.  The way he built up the scenes to shocking, often surprising conclusions was phenomenal.<br /><br />The actors' performances were outstanding, though Brad Pitt is included more for comic relief than anything else.  Christoph Waltz and Melanie Laurent easily stole this film. The film was more about story and performance, masterfully told, than violence.  The squeamish friend enjoyed it, and Quentin seems to have redeemed himself in her eyes.<br /><br />Stunning cinema!
031606792X|5.0|Breaking Dawn is the fourth book in the Twilight series by Stephenie Meyer. I have read all of the previous books, but this is by far my favorite. The book begins with Edward and Bella finally getting married, just like Edward wanted, and then progresses to their honeymoon which is where the problems begin. Bella starts getting sick in the morning and has weird stomach pains, and when Edward calls Carlisle, he doesn't expect to hear the words that comes out of his mouth..\\"She is pregnant.\\"       The plot of this book revolves around Edward, with the help of Jacob, trying to convince Bella to stop the pregnancy because it is killing her. The whole Cullen family is very worried about her safety and what will happen once the baby is born. Will Bella survive or die? The plot is so well thought out that the readers will actually think vampires and werewolves are real. There is never a dull moment in this book, which keeps the intensity up and the reader's minds working hard trying to figure out what is going to happen next. I know I had to force myself to put the book down for a while, and I know the same will happen for you.     The structure of the book is written in chronological order. The book goes from the wedding, to the honeymoon, pregnancy, fights, love, etc. up until the final moments of the birth. Also, another neat thing that Stephenie Meyer does is she changes points of view. In the beginning, Bella was the one talking and telling the story, but then Jacob jumped in and started telling his side and his thoughts. By doing this, she has showed us more than just one character's reactions to everything going on in the story and that makes it seem more real.    Just like in all of the other books in this series, the theme is love and romance. Edward and Bella have such a strong love and connection for one another, but what makes the book so amazing is that Jacob is madly in love with Bella, too. It kills him to see Edward with Bella because he would do anythingto be with her. However, instead of trying to convince Bella to be with him, he is there as her best friend. Bella made up her mind and he has to respect her decisions. After reading these books and seeing how amazing both Edward and Jacob treat Bella, I sure hope I find a guy like either of them! Preferably one that looks like Jacob, too. (Taylor Lautner) =] Romance and love is one of the best themes to put into a book because everyone can connect and relate to certain things that happen then.    I liked every single thing in the book. Stephanie is an amazing author and it is apparent how much time she put into each and every one of these books. The thing I liked most in this book is that she changed points of view. I love when authors do that because we learn so much more about every character, instead of just learning what the main character tells about other people. However, throughout these books and from the two movies I have become more of a Jacob fan. If Bella had gone and been with Jacob I would fall even more in love with this series, but Edward is a great guy, too, so it's still good.    All in all, this book is very good and easy to read, which is why I give it 5 stars. I wish this wasn't the last book in the series because after I finished the previous books I couldn't wait to start the next one. Now I am going to read all of Stephenie Meyer's other books and I am sure they will be just as amazing. I recommend this book to everyone; You will not be disappointed.     Thank you,  Dana Sullivan
B000KJU1HI|5.0|I would agree that this is a film which all those who are interested in the life of Bob Dylan, whether fanatical fan or casual listener-reader-watcher, should see. It is an excellent, realistically shot, accounting of an concert tour ,by the young Dylan and his then-entourage, through England.  I found it quite entertaining as were the limited number of concert pieces that he performed.  Having said that, I should add that it would be sheer self-delusion to believe that one has learned much about Dylan, save how he  speaks, what some of his entourage, and other people he met, looked and sounded, the feel of some of the hotel rooms, and similar matters. What we cannot learn from these pictures and sounds, is the meaning of the actual scenes, the place they have, from the perspective of the tour and of Dylan's career line,  and.........In other words, we are seeing a dream-like illusion not social or psychological dynamics which make up the meaningful experience.  By no coincidence, I am concurrently reading one of the accepted standard biographies of Dylan to the age of about 50. While no book has been able to provide an acceptably \\"realistic\\" portrait of the singer/songwriter, the written form gives the possibility of greater depth than does a photo, series of photographs, or a moving picture. However, to the point, the ability of the written material to describe the roles of each of the participants in the Dylan nexus adds substance to the screen portrayal of their physical interactions.   At any rate,  the film is a fine representation of the craft and a picture of what it might have been like to be a fly on the wall during some events in the life of a very important person. It is highly recommended.
0061122416|5.0|\\"The Alchemist\\" in its twenty-second year as a best seller has found its way to the four corners of the world, and to me. I read this about two years and have just reread it as we enter the decade of the 2010s. It is a good read at the beginning of any new year.<br /><br /> In \\"The Alchemist,\\" Author Paul Coelho has written an entertaining and inspiring fable about an Andalusian shepherd boy, Santiago, who is inspired to seek his treasure by a gypsy woman and an old man. On the journey, the young shepherd, learns about the fundamental truths of life - we are not victims of fate, love is the greatest alchemy of all, we must trust our hearts, we must live without fear but with courage and enthusiasm - and, most importantly, we will find our treasure within ourselves.
B001FB562U|5.0|I won't repeat the theme as other reviewers have done this. Though this film does take place in a very bleak and hopeless time as others have mentioned, it still projects hope and displays intense, dedicated love. This is much of what makes the movie as good as it is. In a time when there should be no hope, the father and son hold on to each other. They search for something that they have no right to hope in, a place where they can be safe and fed. It may not even exist, yet they take to the road despite the fact that many others have given up. They choose to hope.<br /><br />The relationship between the father and son was so well acted that it was very believable. Viggo Mortenson played this father determined to protect his son with such a fierce passion and vulnerability that it was mesmerizing. The actor playing the son was just as fantastic. Vulnerable and innocent, with such trust of the father, reacting to the evil in the world, but still wanting to do good. It was moving.<br /><br />This was a movie that makes you think. It showed that in desperate circumstances, some will give up and choose death, some will choose evil to survive, others will choose to do no harm while surviving, and still others will risk everything to do good despite what they're up against. It was very true to life.<br /><br />This film was powerful, fascinating and well done, and I recommend it.
0060751967|4.0|Fun, light reads, the Love at Stake series is a nice mix of humor, action, drama, suspense and romance. The series focuses on vampires finding their love interests. The good vampires (who drink synthetic blood) fight the malcontents (bad vamps who take blood from humans). The series moves along quickly and is hard to put down. There are many laugh out loud funny moments. I enjoyed the characters and seeing them again in future books. The author did a nice job with world building with some original ideas like the vampire tv network, synthetic blood mixes, etc. She also does a good job making each book original -- vampire millionaire, clothing designer, reality tv show, etc.<br /><br />If you like this style of book, also check out:<br />Pride Stories by Shelly Laurenston<br />Dragon Kin series by G.A. Aiken<br />Argeneau vampire series by Lynsay Sands<br />Vegas vampire series by Erin McCarthy<br />Dark Ones series and Aisley Gray series by Katie MacAlister<br />Laurenston/Aiken and Sands are my favorites in the humorous paranormal romance category, but the others are also very enjoyable. Happy reading!
B0024SQW2Q|1.0|This movie SUCKED it was a 15 minute story line stretched out to 90 minutes of chewing a mouth full of yarn with bits of tin foil. The acting was good, the story was like a great big fart in church. A flat out embarrassment. I can't believe I spent money to view this piece of trash.
B00005K9LM|5.0|Judas Priest had just finished touring for there highly acclaimed (sometimes) over-rated \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". I know that if you're reading this, you probably think I'm crazy for thinking that, but I believe that it was there follow-up to that classic album that surpassed that on all levels. Defenders of the Faith, I believe took the foundations that were layed down on \\"Screaming For Vengeance\\" and Raised them to \\"11\\" on all levels. They took that sound and cranked it up by making it much heavier, louder, meaner, scarier, a little Gothic, Dark, Gritty, and a lot more intense.     If you don't know what I mean, just listen to every song on this album and you'll see how they tear down anything that was on \\"Screaming for Vengeance\\". While that album had a couple of good ballads (\\"(Take These)Chains\\", \\"Fever\\", \\"Pain and Pleasure\\"). Rob Halford shows more intensity and fury in his voice.    The album blasts the gates open with \\"Freewheel Burning\\", which really showcases what I'm talking about when I say that they sound a lot meaner, heavier, and intense.    \\"Jawbreaker\\" continues that sound with greatness. \\"Rock Hard, Ride Free\\" is very anthemic, but still kick-ass. \\"The Sentinel\\" is epic all on levels. \\"Love Bites\\" is Haunting, Scary, Gothic, But Very Heavy and Kick-Ass (They would normally start there shows in support for this album with this song, and it makes for a awesome opener!)    \\"Eat Me Alive\\" is creepy, fast paced, intense (kinda like \\"Freewheel Burning\\") but with a overall darker tone.    \\"Some Heads Are Gonna Roll\\" is a mid-paced, stalking, dark, song and probably my personal favorite on the album.    \\"Night Comes Down\\" follows in a great way, and even though it is a slower song, it's not a wimpy ballad in no way, it's quite epic and Rob Halford's delivery in this song makes the hairs on the back of my neck stick up.    \\"Heavy Duty/Defenders of the Faith\\" both these songs are separate, but i consider them one song due to \\"Heavy Duty\\" going right into the title track, and it's a great ending to not just a Perfect Priest album, but a Perfect metal album all in all.    Judas Priest followed this with \\"Turbo\\" which sonically went into the glam metal that Priest had no right to be in (although that album was good in it's own light), as they belong with Just Heavy Straight Forward Metal. The Priest eventually went back to there true roots with the return to form: \\"Painkiller\\" in 1990, which I believe is the sequel to \\"Defenders of the Faith\\".
B002TIWQNK|2.0|And this is just an overhyped waste of money.  The Viva La Vida song is ok. It comes off as flat compared to the Coldplay version. The Christmas song is just a slightly tweaked version of music they've already put out.  The \\"My Girl\\" song on the album is ok. It grows on you a bit but it's not PSB at the top of their game.   My suggestion would be to buy the VLV song if you want that and skip the rest.  For $10+ this is really not a product where you get your moneys worth.  I'd say 5.99 or 6.99 would be reasonable.  I say this as a longtime fan since high school who has nearly every CD and several original bootleg masters.    Sound 3 - Average  Value 2 - Below Average

B002XTBEDI|5.0|I was able to watch this follow-up to [[ASIN:B00140PK6O Cranford]] thanks to a particular website and I promptly pre-ordered the DVD as I loved \\"Cranford\\" and its host of interesting and eccentric characters (and yes, I am a period drama fan, especially of BBC productions). This is actually a 2-part special that is not only inspired by the original Cranford, but also two other stories by author Elizabeth Gaskell, i.e. \\"The Moorland Cottage\\", and also \\"The Cage at Cranford\\", see [[ASIN:1434473589 Three Tales of Cranford: Cranford, The Cage at Cranford, and The Moorland Cottage]]. Besides the familiar and beloved cast of the original Cranford such as Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench), Miss Pole (Imelda Staunton),  Mrs Forrester (Julia McKenzie), Miss Tomkinson (Deborah Findlay), etc. several new characters are introduced, such as Lady Glenmire (played by Celia Imrie), and the conjuror Signor Brunoni(Tim Curry).<br /><br />The first part is set in summer 1844 - it has been two years since dear Miss Matty (Dame Judi Dench in another luminous portrayal) lost her beloved sister Deborah, and a year since Sophy Hutton married Dr Harrison (these two characters are no longer in this show). Miss Matty seems content with the presence of her brother Peter (Nicholas Le Prevost) who is home from India, and helps look after Tilly, the baby of her maid Martha and carpenter Jem Hearne. The continuity from the original Cranford is seen in the railway project which still looms menacingly over the town. Things are also made more exciting with the arrival of Mr. Buxton, a wealthy widower who lives with his ward Erminia (Michelle Dockery) and his son William (Tom Hiddleston who is quite the eye candy). Life in Cranford is always full of surprises and when Lady Ludlow's long absent son Septimus (Rory Kinnear) arrives, things take unexpected turns, precipitated by a tragedy in the family. The old tensions are there - especially between those that are against the railroad project and those ,like Captain Brown and young William who feel that modernization is essential to Cranford's long-term survival. Miss Matty, in her usual subtle fashion, gets involved in some of these village proceedings, with some rather startling results.<br /><br />The second part is set later in the year 1844, October  up till Christmas - Miss Matty and her friends are predictably excited at the visit of Lady Glenmire (Celia Imrie) but when Mrs Jamieson (Barbara Flynn) feels no one amongst her peers is of suitably high rank to meet her, she and Lady Glenmire get snubbed by Matty and company and it is left to Lady Glenmire to set things right in a most memorable way. Matty also faces some challenges that involves a falling out amongst her circle of friends,a serious romance between William and a young woman deemed unsuitable by his father (which has Matty pondering the wisdom of her 'involvement' in bringing the pair together), and more tragedy on the horizon, affecting the citizens of Cranford.The magic of the original is still evident and this follow-up (of sorts - it's not strictly a sequel though some story arcs from the first Cranford get developed here) is still charming and engrossing. A fair note of warning, this particular installment in the Cranford franchise is much more subdued than the original and there's quite a fair bit of tragedy - there's death (involving a couple of familiar characters who were also in the original), grief, tension, family drama, imperiled friendships, the age-old battle between those opposed to change and those who embrace the challenges of modernization,etc., but there's also romance, lighthearted moments and even a bit of magic!The comic and the tragic are seamlessly blended into the story, resulting in an immensely satisfying viewing experience. I loved it though I can understand how this particular follow-up might disappoint purists who loved the original and how well it adhered to Gaskell's novel. As for the production qualities - they are excellent. The cinematography is gorgeous, capturing the beauty of the village surroundings as well as the period details, and the score complements the story perfectly. I wish I could be so lucky as to live in a place like Cranford!ellent.

076781326X|2.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />I need to be a dissenting voice and say that this movie is not as good as it wants its audience to believe it is.  The only things that recommend it are an admittedly grandiose portrayal of Fagin by Ron Moody that justly rivals Alec Guinness in the overall better \\"Oliver Twist,\\" and a couple of songs that rise above the mediocrity of their counterparts.  \\"Food, Glorious Food\\" and \\"Consider Yourself\\" are not reason enough to make the rest of the musical.  Performances are shoddy and unremarkable.  Bill Sikes is a dandy bore in this production and not the monster Dickens wrote him to be.  Worst of all, Dickens' message of nobility amidst poverty is completely lost in the desire to mutate the story into a happy-go-lucky song-and-dance.  Stay away at all costs.
045122499X|1.0|Unlike most Amazon reviewers, I rate \\"World Without End\\" a single star, as I found it uninteresting and, in particular, it did not build upon my knowledge base of the late Medieval/early Renaissance period, as \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" had done of the earlier period.  Let me be clear -- I think that \\"Pillars\\" is a monumental work that should be read by any American heading to France and/or England to admire the skyscrapers of the Middle Ages, the great Gothic cathedrals.  Among other things, \\"Pillars\\" conveyed a sense that the clergy were often anything but pious and that the serfs lived a life of sheer randomness and potential terror; those concepts put building the cathedrals in a strong historic context without being tedious, which books such as Barbara Tuchman's \\"A Distant Mirror\\" can be.  But \\"World Without End\\" seems to lack any original research -- it simply piggy-backs on the earlier work's creations -- and is little more than a common trash novel.  Any potential reader who liked \\"Pillars\\" would be much better advised to read \\"Sarum\\" by Edward Rutherford, rather than wasting time on \\"A Distant Mirror.\\"  A sweeping historic tale a la Michener, \\"Sarum\\" spends much time on the building of the Salisbury Cathedral, but continues through to the 20th century.  It is a far worthier companion to \\"Pillars\\" than Follett's latest book.
0786838655|4.0|Soon to be released as a movie, a decent book. It's targetted at the early teen readers, I think, similar to the target of the early Harry Potter books. In a similar vein, it has a draw even if you're older than that.<br /><br />Well written, if a little _too_ tight. It might have been interesting to see a little more exposition before the main thrust of the story proceeded, but I can understand with the target audience why getting into the meat of things as soon as possible was desired.<br /><br />All in all, a book I'm glad to have read. It's a quick read, and I'm off to the second in the series.

0385504225|5.0|Short chapter style works for me. Unbelievable detail includes thoughts and emotions, location and action, out of box picture as well as minute details. It wasn't not tiring at all to me. I loved the way he placed direct thoughts from the characters minds italicized. The story line was great and the way each chapter revealed more and more but not too much and certinly not too little. Excellent ending and epilogue. I recall several spot on keeper lines of humour. I also found the author was equally merciful and evil (both angel and a demon haha) in the latter chapters regarding the fate of the protagonist (that is all I can say without giving anything - you will know exactly what I mean when yor get there). Beware that no matter what you are doing or where you are you will not be able to put this book down. Again, the ending was greatness.     I've never read Dan Brown before. This was enough for me to buy his other works.     I hope to see this one as a movie.

044661758X|5.0|When I first discovered Connelly (long after everyone else did, obviously), I began by reading several of his more recent novels. There were good parts and not so good parts and, overall, I wasn't unduly impressed. I wondered where his great reputation had come from. So I went back and began reading his books from the beginning. As I suspected, his earlier stuff is far, far better than his recent work. This one is his third novel about Harry Bosch, Los Angeles native and twenty-year homicide detective. Harry, whose whole existence is wrapped up in being a cop and in catching killers, is also a significant bit of gristle in the body of the LAPD. He doesn't bend, he doesn't suffer fools, he doesn't tolerate betrayal, and he's been frequently in trouble with his superiors and with the system. That's just the sort of person Harry is, take him or leave him. Four years ago, he was involved in the hunt for a serial killer, dubbed \\"the Dollmaker\\" by the media, and was responsible for eventually finding him and killing him. He did it his way, naturally, and, while being cleared of any wrongdoing by the department, he nevertheless was disciplined by being yanked out of the elite Robbery-Homicide Division and sent down to Hollywood Division, which is not a nice place. But he's managing -- and , in fact, having been around Hollywood all his life -- the real, scruffy Hollywood, not the glamorous image -- he may actually prefer it. Now the Dollmaker's widow has brought a civil suit against the city for wrongful death and Harry has to listen to the widow's lawyer re-interpreting all his actions in the worse possible light. But the lawyer is an extremely talented firebrand when it comes to excessive force cases and he can't help admiring her. Then another body turns up following receipt of a tip-off note, buried in concrete this time, and it looks like the Dollmaker is still out there. Did Harry really kill the wrong man? Was he actually innocent? That's every honest cop's nightmare and it gets its hold on Harry, who has to balance sitting at the defense table in court with trying to pursue this new case in order to save his own soul. I'll say nothing further about the plot (just in case you haven't read the book), except that it's carefully constructed and entirely believable in its internal structure. There are no wild leaps of logic, just careful, plodding police work illuminated here and there by helpful accidents and unanticipated discoveries -- just like real life. Harry is a fully realized, four-dimensional human being. He's not necessarily the sort of person you would always like, but you can respect him. His colleagues and adversaries are also very well done and the \\"telling details,\\" as they say, the bits of business that build verisimilitude, make this an extremely impressive story. Moreover, in the previous book, Harry discovered an attraction to the widow of another cop (a widow he created, actually) and they've been developing a cautious relationship for more than a year now. It's difficult for Harry to let anyone else into the dark places in his life, but he's trying -- and that makes him even more human. I wish the author could get back this ability to write a gripping story with no gaps in logic.e and it gets its hold on Harry, who has to balance sitting at the defense table in court with trying to pursue this new case in order to save his own soul.

Only two people stand between anarchy and freedom: one of them, Augustus Gibbons, has just survived a hit on the National Security Agency's top-secret headquarters and is on the run. The other, a decorated Special Ops soldier, Darius Stone, sits under close guard in a military prison. Gibbons once again finds himself in need of an outsider and Stone is his man. The new XXX agent must uncover the insurgents from within. It is the nation's only hope to stop the first coup d'etat in American history. This is a fun and non-stop action movie.
B000FZETKC|5.0|Another reviewer did an awesome comparison to \\"Pretty in Pink\\" and they were right on the money.  A great side-by-side compare and contrast.  I had never thought of \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" this way.<br /><br />When this movie came out, I think I saw it in the movie theater 3-4 times before I actually owned it on VHS and more recently DVD.  It is one of my favorite movies of all time because I always identified with Watts' character (and was told by friends in the 80's about the reminder).  If you are a lover of the 80's John Hughes genre of films you will love this one.  The characters are played out well and the storyline is very sweet.  You can really feel the teenage angst between Mary Stuart Masterson \\"Watts\\" and Eric Stolz \\"Keith\\" as a best-friendship works towards something more.  Many of the actors and actresses in \\"Some Kind of Wonderful\\" have gone on to bigger careers and also recur in other John Hughes films.<br /><br />After 20+ years, this still remains one of my favorite movies.  A must for every John Hughes groupie.
B000PY52EU|5.0|There was a time when Lazarus played the blues; a time he got Bojo's Juke Joint shakin' back in the day. Now he lives them. Bitter and broken from a cheating wife and a shattered marriage, Lazarus' soul is lost in spent dreams and betrayal's contempt--until Rae. Half naked and beaten unconscious, Rae is left for dead on the side of the road when Lazarus discovers her. This movie is as interesting as it is intriguing. I enjoyed this movie very much and I highly recommend it to all adults.
0316113077|5.0|this is really the book you want to learn cake decorating  clear instruction, lots of ideas, lots of picture  worth to buy, recommended for yourself   or gift for someone who is a home baker who just want to make something special for the family
B00000JL86|5.0|A young princess attempts to regain her throne from the madman who took it from her family years before. Anastasia is an outstanding movie. It has great voices, great picture, a great story, great art, and wonderful music. A superb film for children and adults alike.
B002HWRYJE|3.0|The Talosians are definitely in charge. What I mean by that is the special effects wizards at ILM, bless em, can create any imagery, conjure any imploding star, lens flare, cloud nebula, or incredibly destructive explosion you can imagine. The writers and producers can create any kind of convoluted, twisting plot, design any virtual set, city, or structures, shoot with any unusual camera angle, or engage in virtually any kind of wild stunt you never dreamed you could see.<br /><br />It's Wagnerian Whiz-Bang, pedal-to-the-metal, over-the-top-entertainment typical of today's over-produced and over-stimulative blockbusters. Is this really what big movies are all about? It's true, it's giving our kids ADD.<br /><br />As a Star Trek TOS purist, it doesn't fit the mold of the original series. But because JJ Abrams and his team employed the original characters, and made an extraordinary attempt to bring back the original Star Trek bridge, I give them extra credit for their artistic vision and ambition.<br /><br />In fact, the visual concepts with their enormity of scale and rich detail, the action, and their execution are absolutely spellbinding. This film is loaded with great action sequences that are at the hot cutting edge of anything out there.<br /><br />Nevertheless, I think we should all sit down calmly, take a stress pill and think things over. Just slow down, man. And bring back the social commentary that was what Star Trek was all about.
B00026ZG10|5.0|Marital problems plague an international spy who works for Omega Sector, a top-secret government agency charged with the intervention of nuclear terrorism. This movie is a great comedical movie with great action sequence's. The actors are fantasic and play each role beautifully.
B002ZHKZEC|5.0|Having just watched \\"End of Time\\" broadcast in both lo-def and hi-def, can say that blu-ray will make the most of some of the beautiful matte painting backdrops and sets. Not sure it matters as much for the extensive chase and action sequences - it's the slower parts that shine. You can really see the emotion on the faces of Dr and Master in some of the close conversations. e.g. \\"Can you hear it?\\" in End of Time part 1.    No spoilers other than those almost everywhere on the net, but Tennant goes out on a poignant note that's different and appropriate. Roaring action, wrenching choices, and a lot of interactions at the end that should please the fans, even if a little downbeat. The first Doctor in a long time (since Pertwee?) to really appreciate the 'mortality' of a regeneration.    Set seems a worthy addition to the collection. In order, would rate the episodes best first as    End Of Time,  Waters of Mars,  Next Doctor,  Planet of the Dead,    for any that want them individually.
B000F1IQNC|5.0|A new nanny enters the household of the recently widowed Mr. Brown and attempts to tame his seven exceedingly ill-behaved children. The children, led by the oldest boy Simon, have managed to drive away 17 previous nannies and are certain that they will have no trouble with this one. But as Nanny McPhee takes control, they begin to notice that their vile behavior now leads swiftly and magically to rather startling consequences. Her influence also extends to the family's deeper problems, including Mr. Brown's sudden and seemingly inexplicable attempts to find a new wife; an announcement by the domineering Aunt Adelaide that she intends to take one of the children away; and the sad and secret longings of their scullery maid, Evangeline. As the children's behavior begins to change, Nanny McPhee's arresting face and frame appear to change as well, creating even more questions about this mysterious stranger whom the children and their father have come to love. A witty, rocking kids' movie that adults will enjoy, too.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|Even the most basic student of storytelling (in whatever format) knows that a great story must have an introduction, a conflict, and ultimately a climax and a resolution. This movie is strong on intro and plot, but weak on climax and a failure on resolution. What is the ultimate outcome???? The movie criticizes apartheid (Congratulations, I think everyone in the modern world agrees apartheid was evil), but what is the end of the story???? I wasted nearly 2 hours developing sympathy for the oppressed alien prawns and I still don't know is their ultimate future???? Nice political points, but pathetic storytelling!!!
B0014Z4OQG|5.0|Five young New Yorkers throw their friend a going-away party the night that a monster the size of a skyscraper descends upon the city. Told from the point of view of their video camera, the film is a document of their attempt to survive the most surreal, horrifying event of their lives. This movie is a heart-pacing experience with plenty of chills and exhilaration.
B00204AA0O|5.0|I also stayed away from this album for a few months because I was scared in being disappointed in Regina.  HOWEVER, I can not stop listening to each song, I find myself singing her songs when I don't mean to, the lyrics touch your soul, move your soul just as much as her previous songs.  I am impressed and surprised.
B0009UC7HA|5.0|Explorer Dirk Pitt, a modernday Indiana Jones, joins a U.N. science expedition in the Sahara to search for a toxin that is killing marine life. A cheerfully silly action adventure that finally gives Matthew McConaughey a role that fits his carefree, sexy, Southern-boy style.
B00006HAZG|4.0|Whilst this adaption has an excellent cast (Bob Hoskins as Micawber was particularly good) and is really enjoyable and moving, I longed for it to be longer - I think Dickens' novels need more time to unfold. In this respect, I thought the recent BBC adaption of \\"Bleak House\\" got it just right. It is nearly 20 years since I read the book but the thing that struck me was forcefully was how people in their lives could not avoid the spectre of death - consequently life appeared more real and substantial not like the entertainment culture we live in!
B00009ZYBY|5.0|In the final days of Marcus Aurelius' reign, the aging emperor angers his son Commodus by making it known that he wants Maximus, a fearsome and respected Roman general, to be his successor. Power-hungry Commodus kills his father and orders the death of Maximus. But the latter flees, only to discover that his wife and child have been murdered by Commodus. Crowe proves he is a world class star with his versatile, passionate and physically virile performance. This movie engages the senses and the mind and lingers in the memory.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The beatles is one of the best rock bands ever compare to todays rock music, most stuff like Linkin park, etc, are just terrible.     The beatles band today is consider as classic rock but back in the hippie generation(1960's) it was kind of consider as psychedelic music.      I think today rock music like linkin park, slipknot, etc. sucks...because their too commercial an main stream, etc.    Like the 70s an 60s music are way better than late 90s till now music.    Anyway this arent much of a review but what the hell.

B000HEWEDK|5.0|Forbidden Planet is full of TV and movie stars of my childhood and into adulthood.  It is a classic and is a great addition to anyone's DVD library.  The movie was made before all the computer genertated movies of today and has great special effects for it's time.  Remember, the kids in the movie \\"Halloween\\" were watching FORBIDDEN PLANET when Michael Myers came to pay a visit to Jamie Lee!  I recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys SciFi.
B00007AJF8|4.0|The first time I saw this movie I did not like it at all because I really had no idea what was going on or what was the point of the movie. After subsequent viewings I still am kind of lost but I just accept that and I cannot stop laughing when I see this movie, it does hold my attention. So even though I'm still not sure of the point of the movie I find it very entertaining in a strange way because it just cracks me up and in today's times I need and appreciate a good laugh!!!
0783240236|5.0|One of Alfred Hitchcocks best movies.  In the day before computer generation, the methods that the movie makers used to make the special effects works.  If you purchase this movie, make sure you watch the interviews with surviving cast and the methods used to make the special effects.  I enjoyed this movie when I fist saw it and I purchased it for my SciFi/Halloween line-up.  Several great stars in the movie and it is done as well as a movie of the time could be done.  Classic Hitchcock - I highly recommend this movie.
1401323820|4.0|This novel is something of an advertisement for the ABC network Series \\"Castle\\". In the program, the lead character Richard Castle, played by Nathan Fillion, is a mystery novelist who uses his connections with the mayor of New York to finagle a ride along with Police Detective Kate Beckett, portayed by Stana Katic. This novel is the \\"result\\" of that research.    Having stated all that It really is a well written Mystery novel. It captures the readers attention and forces them to invest in ll the characters to follow the mystery thru to the end. Jameson Rook and Nikki Heat have an undeniable chemistry and the subsidiary characters all keep teh story moving at a swift fluid pace. I highly recommend picking it upi. Well worth the read.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This was my first kindle purchase and I read it as quickly as I could click through.
0060837551|5.0|I think this is a very beautiful and intricate novel. It has so much detail about the surroundings and the people. It takes you deep into the lands and the motivations and feelings of the characters. I savored every bit about the description of life in the land down under and the land of the long white cloud.    The characters were intricately spelled out. The love affair between the priest and Meggie was an unexpected development. Even without it, the book would have been a true delight rich in detail about decades now past.    Highly recommended for anyone with a nostalgia for old times and a love of rich, moving and detailed descriptions brimming with a fresh humanity.
0545140315|4.0|The Lonely Hearts Club by Elizabeth Eulberg is a definite debut winner. It's a fun and genuine story.<br /><br />Penny is a lively character. I was reading this book on my plane ride back to Colorado and I was fully immersed in her thoughts and goals as she created The Lonely Hearts Club and watched it take-off in directions she never expected.<br /><br />I liked seeing friendships being revived, new friendships springing up, and seeing how Penny deals with the feelings she has for a boy she has always considered just a friend. I also liked the fact that Penny isn't perfect. She makes a few hurtful remarks her classmates, she isn't always the perfect friend, but at the same time, she tries. She really wants to see her club revolve around friendship and putting yourself first: not your friends, not your boyfriend. It isn't a club about not dating, even if that's the impetus for starting it, it becomes so much more.<br /><br />There was one thing that I wish had been shown a bit more in the story, rather than just tacked on and told by the author. Penny has a friend, Kara, who is obviously struggling with an eating disorder. By book's end, a few friends tell Penny that Kara has decided to get help for it and the girls go on to say that she was inspired by Penny and the club. I felt there was a huge gap in that part of the story, minor as it was. You see Penny influencing other girls, but if you're going to throw that in to the story, may as well give it a bit more depth. (Seriously, this is the only minor nitpick I have.)<br /><br />I enjoyed the romance aspects of the story, and watching Penny see her crush, Nate, through new eyes. Reality and boys don't often go hand in hand, but this story provided a nice vehicle to see the downsides to relationship behaviors, from both guys and girls.<br /><br />And mostly, this is just a totally fun story. Lots of great Beatles references, a strong friendship story, and just enough romance thrown in to make this book a sure hit with YA readers, both middle grade and high school I'd say since it's a rather clean read for the most part. I have to touch on the truly awesome karaoke scene in this book too! As a karaoke aficionado, I had the biggest grin on my face during this part of the story.<br /><br />All in all, an enjoyable read. Enough depth to give what can be an overused topic a bit of a new shine.gh school I'd say since it's a rather clean read for the most part.

B003102JDM|5.0|One of the best movies of the last decade, for sure.  Smart, funny.  This film gives no easy answers but, in spite of being labeled a \\"black comedy\\", doesn't oppress you.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|There you have it, James Cameron's first film since \\"Titanic\\" wrapped up in five words.  If I was Michael Blake, I'd sue him for everything he's got.  With [[ASIN:B000G6BM00 Aliens]], [[ASIN:B001VLBDD0 Terminator 2 - Judgment Day]] and [[ASIN:B00000JLWW Titanic]], he wrote interesting characters that held their own against the incredible special effects; in this, they are all cliches who do not say or do one original thing.  It seems that every star in Hollywood ends up doing one pet project and it always sucks (look up a little film called [[ASIN:0792843584 Heaven's Gate]] if you don't believe me).  I guess this one was his.<br /><br />Yes, I am more than happy to admit the visual effects were impressive--I'd be stupid to say otherwise; heck, they're probably a shoo-in for the Oscar.  But Jim, can you do me a favor?  Go look up George Lucas and ask him which is more important:  visual effects or the story and characters?  Be warned though; if you do go see him, he might just sue you too for ripping off the third act of [[ASIN:B00076SCPW Star Wars, Episode VI- Return of the Jedi (Widescreen Edition)]].
B001KVZ6FW|5.0|The Pixar machine has so many feathers in its cap it now looks like a Vegas showgirl. UP is Pixar's tenth animated feature film and I would say that it's among the studio's best, except that each of its pictures tends to rank pretty much right up there. And it's looking more and more like there's no end in sight concerning Pixar's run of awesome. (Rumor has it that John Lasseter, Pixar's head honcho, once broke wind and it smelled like dandelions on a gorgeous summer day.)<br /><br />While on the surface still very much geared towards kids' sensibilities, UP trots out some fairly mature adult themes. If the first twelve minutes of UP don't at least choke you up, then you are a soulless cyborg. The opening act is a nearly dialogue-less montage, and it encapsulates the life of a man. This segment is absolutely key to setting up the rest of the story, makes you root for the old cranky, creaky gent Carl Fredricksen. The stuff that he goes thru, the sadness that crushes him, the dreams and hopes that get dashed because life simply got in the way - you know exactly why he goes on to do what he does. Which is sail away in his house strung up on thousands of balloons.<br /><br />You'd have to be an utter grinch to bring up the slovenly physics involved, so let's not. Hundreds of feet up in the air, Mr. Fredricksen hears a knock on his door. Bemused, he opens it and sees Russell cowering on his porch. Russell is a tubby eight-year-old wilderness scout, and he's enthusiastic and, if I'm brutally honest, borderline annoying. The kid needs to earn his Assisting the Elderly badge and he's set his eyes on Mr. Fredricksen. We learn eventually that Russell's overeagerness may be his way of compensating for tough times at home. UP, at its core, is about these two characters and their emotional journeys and it's also about the process of, while not exactly putting the past to bed, at least moving on. Carl and Russell move on to South America (\\"It's like America - but South!\\").<br /><br />UP is an extremely moving, heartbreaking picture, but it's also very funny and features several things which may make you cry out \\"Adorable!\\" ad nauseam. The main villain of the piece is deranged and sinister, and his assistants consist of a pack of talking dogs. Which leads me to this: I love Dug! Dug is one of the talking dogs, a rambling, whuffy Labradorish type, and he's exactly what you'd expect a lovable dog to be like. Dug isn't as clever or focused as the other dogs. He just wants to be loved, and Bob Peterson, the co-writer & co-director of the thing, comes up with the perfect voice for him. Also a neat character is Kevin the giant bird, but Kevin doesn't have a fancy collar which allows her dialogue.<br /><br />The animation is flawless. Why even go into it? It's Pixar.<br /><br />The single DVD version also comes with two riotous bonus animated shorts. \\"Partly Cloudy,\\" which preceded UP in the theaters, pokes holes in the bird and the bees theory. Babies instead come from clouds. \\"Partly Cloudy\\" tells the story of one slightly seedy-looking cloud which leans towards making the not-so-cute babies and the poor stork that has to deliver them. \\"Dug's Special Mission\\" is narrated thru Dug's perspective as we see the moments leading up to Dug's first meeting with Mr. Fredricksen and Russell.<br /><br />I like the visual twist of a house kept aloft by a gazillion balloons, and then this floating house being toted around by our characters as if it were one big balloon. Rather than chilling in the crib, Mr. Fredricksen and Russell actually spend more time outdoors tethered to the house and towing it with them. \\"Adventure is out there!\\" is an often mentioned motto in the movie, and our characters land themselves in a wild, exotic adventure. Fun for the kids, fun for the grown-ups, and bolstered by powerful dramatic undertones.

1906694176|4.0|As the third and final entry in the \\"Millennium Trilogy,\\" \\"The Girl Who Kicked the Hornets' Nest\\" is both wildly entertaining and somewhat bittersweet. Larsson's untimely death means that the series (originally intended to be much longer than three books) will not continue. And though this book ends the trilogy on a satisfying note (as opposed to, say, the maddening cliffhanger ending of the second book), there were clearly plenty of avenues left to explore in the wonderful world he'd created.<br /><br />First, a brief caution: this book should absolutely not be read without having read the first two. I had difficulty enough keeping straight the characters and storylines from the first two installments; I can't imagine how much of an endeavor this would be for someone not familiar with the rest of the series. Plus, reading this first would spoil events from the first two books, both of which are exceptional, so if you haven't read them yet, please do so before reading this one.<br /><br />That said, this final chapter of the trilogy starts off fast and never lets up. In a lot of ways it plays as the back half to the second book--it gets right into the action, starting off only minutes after the cliffhanger conclusion of \\"The Girl Who Played With Fire,\\" and the entirety of this book essentially deals with the fallout of the events that took place therein. That said, this book does take on a life of its own, introducing new and compelling characters and throwing out mile-a-minute plot twists that the series has become known for.<br /><br />In this book, the power of the media and investigative journalism is in the forefront, as Mikael Blomkvist and his colleagues at Millennium attempt to take down a massive conspiracy in the highest ranks of the Swedish government. Lisbeth Salander, meanwhile, faces problems of her own as she is in the hospital awaiting trial for the events of the second book, and Erika Berger starts her job as editor-in-chief of a new newspaper, where she encounters unexpected difficulties. A team of police inspectors, many of whom carry over from the second book, lead their own investigation to try to get at the truth. Larsson masterfully weaves all of these threads together, which sometimes go in their own direction, but more often that not intersect in surprising and delightful ways.<br /><br />For the most part the book reads fast and compelling, though every now and then (as in the other books), Larsson gets a bit too caught up in historical and technical details. There's a section, for example, which goes into far more detail than is necessary regarding the history and infrastructure of the Swedish Intelligence Community, and while it certainly shows the amount of research Larsson put into his book, it creates a lull in what is otherwise a fast-paced ride, and I found myself skimming through a couple of sections like this to get back to the story at hand.<br /><br />This book is certainly on par with the first two, and evidences that even after three books, the series was going as strong as when it first started. It's a shame we won't get to see how the rest of the series plays out--especially since Salander and Blomkvist were kept largely apart for the second and third books, and surely would have developed their relationship more had the series continued. Their relationship was truly a unique and fascinating one, and it's something of a tragedy that we'll never get to see it come to fruition the way Larsson had intended. Nevertheless, the books as a trilogy are wildly entertaining and some of the best reads to come out in the past few years, and though we may not have gotten the full story of these wonderful and compelling characters, we should be thankful all the same for the chance to meet them, and to join them in their adventures if only for a short while.cted difficulties.

B000ZELISO|1.0|I agree with other reviewers who have noted just how poor the quality is of this film transfer.  I even tried switching from the Blu-ray to standard DVD, and tried the Blu-ray on two different TVs and two different Blu-ray players.  All have horrible quality.  I did not see this movie in the theater, but I can only figure no present-day DP would be this poor at lighting a picture.  Something must have been done wrong in the transfer.
4770030096|5.0|This is a really good series. It teaches you how to write also. I taught myself Japanese with this series.
0143038419|4.0|The author rides an extreme emotional roller coaster at the beginning of the book. She goes through a divorce and then immediately jumps into an all consuming relationship. After that ends, she journeys through Italy, India and Indonesia to find good food, \\"religion\\" and true love. I think it's a great read. There are a few slow parts (hence the 4 stars), but for the most part, it's a page turner. The utter frankness in which she tells her story and bravely embarks on these new experiences is completely endearing. Gilbert doesn't claim to have all of the answers, but does set out to find them. It's a very courageous and honest book that I was glad to read. I've seen the reviews about her being selfish, self-indulgent, etc. In some ways, I would agree, but as she's being completely candidate about her spiritual journey and what she needs to make her whole again, I think it's only fitting.
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I have seen every available version of 'Emma' released thus far that I could get my hands on, and this is by far, my favorite!  The A&E version was well done, and Gwenyth Paltrow's enjoyable (especially Jeremy Northam as Mr. Knightley, yay!), but this series actually captured the essence of 'Emma'...it was absolutely lovely!      Romala Garai plays Emma excellently: Emma is my least favorite Jane Austen heroine, but I actually like her in this particular version!  Garai brings a certain warmth & vulnerability to the character that makes her quite lovable, even with all her apparent flaws: the movie is quite cute & fun, while at the same time being deep and interesting!      Johnny Lee Miller plays a nice Mr. Knightley, and the chemistry between the two main characters rings true; I will admit to liking Jeremy Northam (from the Gwenyth Paltrow version) just a bit more as that character.  But Miller does an excellent job with the character, and I must say that the others were quite well cast!  Michael Gambon as Emma's father, and Jodhi May as Miss Taylor/Mrs. Weston, was a delightful surprise!      The series comes across with warmth & sunshine, and is just such an enjoyable watch: everyone will love to see this one again & again: by far the best overall version of 'Emma' so far, I will be enjoying this countless times myself: I would highly recommend!
B002KQ6BT6|1.0|My husband and I enjoy Dan Brown's books and purchase and read them regularly when they come out. We read this one together, and we were very disappointed. The plot was much less believable than those in his other books, we found the \\"twists\\" to be predictable, and the writing just wasn't as good as usual. The end of the book dragged on and on, and we were so relieved when it was finally over. We will still read his future books, but this one has already been deleted from my Kindle, never to be downloaded and read again.
B000SO7OM0|5.0|What an experience it must have been to sit in such a magnificent palacial setting and listen to this wonderful music performed live. Having been a fan of Loreena McKennitt since I first heard \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" back in the 90's, I now own her entire catalog. She has chosen a superb playlist for this live performance that will please her longtime fans and will be a great introduction to her work if you haven't heard her before.<br /><br />Loreena is often miscategorized as a \\"New Age\\" singer, but it is better to call her a \\"World\\" singer. Her music has none of the trite homilies set forth as \\"life-changing\\" messages in New Age music. She sings traditional Irish folk music, she writes her own songs that mesh beautifully with classical works, and she is an incredible musician, taking passages from Shakespeare and classical poems and setting them to music that sounds like the poems were written to be performed to it.<br /><br />In \\"Nights from the Alhambra\\" Loreena's spectacular voice is in perfect form, and she has written new arrangements for some of her well-known songs. The musical accompaniment to \\"She Moved Through the Fair,\\" performed a capella on the album, is excellent. The performance of her biggest hit \\"The Mummer's Dance\\" is festive and energetic, as is \\"All Souls Night\\" and \\"Huron (Beltane) Fire Dance,\\" her unique blend of Celtic and Native American rhythms. Her more recent songs, such as \\"Caravanserai,\\" reflect her interest in Middle Eastern music, but blends perfectly with her other songs. This is why I consider her a \\"World Music\\" artist; she can perform so well across so many cultural lines.<br /><br />I would have liked to have heard the full versions of \\"The Lady of Shallott\\" and \\"The Bonny Swans,\\" however.<br /><br />All in all, though, if you love thoughtful, culturally rich and beautifully performed music, then you must watch and listen to \\"Nights from the Alhambra.\\" It is a beautiful performance by an artist at the peak of her powers.
B002NUULNG|5.0|Ghost in the Shell is one of the finest works of the genre.  A groundbreaking narrative about the nature of humanity and what it truly means to be alive.  The story revolves around the emergence of a notorious cyber terrorist known only as \\"The Puppet Master,\\" a terrorist with the ability to hack into the most highly-secured computer systems around the globe, as well as into people's cyber-augmented minds.  Section 9--a group of highly trained Counter-Terrorism Operatives is tasked with bringing this individual to justice.  The movie's protagonist, the fearless Major Motoko Kusanagi leads this operation and delves into her own inner termoil dealing with the nature of her own blurred past.    Video 5/5    OK, since I'm not too familiar with the technical jargon (plus I already used up all of my good SAT words on the intro) I'll just tell you this--it looks great!  Compared to the scratchy, washed out DVD version, GitS 2.0 is vibrant colorful, and incredibly sharp.    Audio 5/5    Big explosions, loud cars, booming um...booms?  It sounds great.  The same care that was given to sharpening the video transfer went into the audio as well.    Extras...depends    The Anime purists out there will undoubtedly turn their collective noses up at the thought of their precious Ghost in the Shell undergoing an unnecessary facelift.  However, with the advent of HD technology--a lot of the CG content that was added doesn't detract from the experience but makes the film seem more polished and just fits in better than the archaic computer generated effects that were present in the original.  If you can overlook this, the wealth of new effects and content added makes GitS feel like a whole new movie.    I highly recommend picking this up if you're an Anime fan, or if you just want to show off your shiny new Blu Ray player to a room full of your envious friends.
0132350882|4.0|Edited by Uncle Bob, this is one of best books in Software Craftsmanship. The book should be a required reading for all Programmers. Even though this book has half a dozen co-authors, the flow is seamless. The authors convey consistent, clear yet very practical set of  ideas in CODE. If you even apply 50 % of the ideas in the book - the guy after you will appreciate it a lot.
B001NFNFNU|5.0|This is a true story & done quite well. Just shows you how bad the LA police department was back then.     A young boy is kidnapped. The police bring back the wrong boy and when the mother saids so they lock her up.     The other side of the movie is about the man who did kidnapped the boy & many other children.     Matthew from OLTL is in this movie. He is owned by the kidnapper.
B000M5B6Q0|3.0|I bought this CD because I just loved the movie.  I love Hugh Grant and was pleasantly surprised to discover that he does his own singing on this soundtrack.  The other songs are fun (especially Buddha's Delight) but this soundtrack is not for everyone.  Its best suited for those of us who love Hugh Grant.
1594489505|5.0|Khaled Hosseini proved himself to be a remarkable storyteller with his first novel, \\"The Kite Runner\\", which was an incredibly readable tale of loss set in Afghanistan.  His follow up, \\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" shares the same mixture of tragedy and hope, set amidst the darkest hours of Afghanistan's troubled, war-riddled history.  It is a heartbreaking tale, at the heart of which are two women from very different backgrounds forced to share incredible hardships together.<br /><br />The story begins with Mariam, a harami (bastard) child who lives with her mother on the outskirts of the town of Herat.  She lives for the weekly visits from her father, never believing her mothers tales about him until it is too late.  All too soon, Mariam's world is uprooted when she is given in marriage to Rasheed, a man much older than she is, and taken away to Kabul, forced into a life of servitude and beatings.  The story then switches to Laila, the beautiful young daughter of a college professor and his wife; their sons have gone off to fight for their country and Laila has never known any love from her mother.  Yet she knows love with her best friend, Tariq, and hopes one day to become his wife.  But these hopes are dashed when war forces them apart.  At this point, Mariam's story and Laila's story become intermingled as their lives are bound to each other in various ways.  Through every hardship they face, Hosseini is faithful to these fictional characters and the very real travesties that Afghan women have had to endure.<br /><br />\\"A Thousand Splendid Suns\\" covers a vast amount of history in its three decade time span, but Hosseini makes it easy to follow the convoluted allegiances that destroyed and rebuilt Afghanistan time and time again.  Readers share in the trials and tribulations and the small joys that these two women experience and can experience the sad and tragic struggle of a country that has been pushed to the side of modern conscience.  Although Hosseini offers his characters hope, their tale is a sad, heartbreaking one that is impossible to put down, and even more impossible to forget.pe, their tale is a sad, heartbreaking one that is impossible to put down, and even more impossible to forget.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|Other reviews here have pretty much covered the waterfront. This is a charming little movie that's both inventive and engaging. The two leads do a fine job of bringing their characters to life, and anyone who's ever been through the ups and downs of unrequited (or barely-requited) love will feel Tom's frustration. Not quite a 5-star move - more like 4.5 stars - but definitely worth watching with someone you love.
B001HN69AO|3.0|The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus isn't the best movie I have seen and it's not really worthy to have been Heath Ledger's last film. Yet, I liked it for it's odd story and the performance by Christopher Plummer. Ledger is really good too of course but the movie wouldn't have been any better if he was in the whole thing. The script is a mess even if the movie still does manage to be interesting.<br /><br />  But Ledger deserved to work with the Terry Gilliam that was at the top of his game, the one that made Time Bandits, Brazil and 12 Monkeys. I was hoping that was the Terry Gilliam that made this movie. I was entertained by the oddness of the movie and the visuals but not enough to give it a higher rating. The movie doesn't make enough sense for me to give it a higher rating. The fact that Ledger turns into either Johnny Depp, Jude Law or Colin Farrell when he enters the Imaginarium does add some fun to the movie though.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|When I saw the trailer for Fantastic Mr. Fox, I was unimpressed, but I am a huge Wes Anderson fan, so I decided to give it a shot.     Wow! I am SO glad I did. This film was such a refreshing change for me--it embraces its storybook roots with simple, puppet-show style sets and animation, instead of basically apologizing for the fact that it's animated by using CGI to easily create the smoothest movement possible.    I usually don't laugh much at movies, but this one had me in tears. True, if you prefer less subtle humor, you may not like it, but in my opinion, this is Anderson's greatest film so far--and maybe my new favorite movie.
0385736002|5.0|My 14 year old son loved this book and he is NOT a reader at all!  Would recommend for any young boy teenager.
0786838655|5.0|My son Matthew offers the following review:  In the book \\"Percy Jackson and the Olympians the Lighting Thief\\" By Rick Riaordan, Percy Jackson, an 11 year old dyslexic boy just wants a normal life but that all goes down the drain quickly. On a normal field trip Percy is shocked when he gets into trouble yet again.  Not only that, but his teacher suddenly becomes a monster from ancient mythology and the world is not what is seems to be. Soon his textbook seems to be coming to life as all of the ancient Greek mythology becomes fact. Percy soon learns that his missing and unknown father is actually a god. Percy then learns there are more kids like him at a magical camp for demigods. After Percy trains to become a hero he embarks on a epic journey to recover stolen property from the gods that could lead to a war. But his journey is full of shocks and twist and deceit is always near. A betrayal is in the mist and Percy must make life-changing choices. Rick Riordan creates a masterpiece of a book and brings adventure, action, and myths to life to keep the reader excited and begging for more.
B000RZOR2U|5.0|These ARE without any possible doubt the DEFINITIVE recordings of the greatest works of music by possibly the greatest genius of all time! The recordings of these cantatas made by Koopman and Suzuki are good but they are not consistent. However, this collection is all the way through. This was and as far as I'm concerned THE standard for performing these works. It set up the program for historically informed performance over  thirty years ago and it still is the standard for all any that come after it. Do not miss owning this collection. I started to buy them when they first came out on LP but it was expensive then and then I started to collect them when the CD technology came out but still couldn't afford the regular purchase of them. Now, they are at a bargain price and anyone who admires Bach and the Baroque shouldn't miss owning them!
B000ZELISO|4.0|I'm a huge Harry Potter fan. Of the books anyway - the movies are nothing thrilling. I havent been happy with a single movie, until this one that is. Alright, they do take a little license from the book (a lot of license actually) and some scenes are completely pointless...but the acting has improved so much and the funny moments definitely make me laugh. Bottom line: treat HP the movie as its own entity...if you dont spend time comparing it to the book, the HP 6 is definitely the best of the series.
B001C3KCSY|5.0|I can't get enough of the lead singer's sexy voice! I listen to it all the time.
B00133KFGW|5.0|As a musician for 30+ years, one of the most difficult things to explain to a lay-person is what SOUL is.  What HEART is.  What musicians mean when they say they were filled up inside, or taken over by music.  Watch the movie!  Fantastic performances, excellent story line, August Rush is incredible.  It immediately jumped to my Top-5 all-time, and I consider this the Wizard Of Oz of movies about music.  PG-rated only because of slight thematic elements, it's still worth watching with kids who are old enough to understand real-world (these days, that's around 7).  Watch the movie!  You've heard the phrase \\"feel-good\\" movie before, but on the mountain range of feel-good films, this is Everest.  At the summit.  Watch the movie! I'm not going to break down the story, or rate the actors individually, or give anything away.  I'll say the only 3 words that matter:    WATCH THE MOVIE!
B0029QRA1U|4.0|If you are looking for an inexpensive usb turntable that does the job easily and quite well, this one could be for you.<br /><br />Just install the software, plug it in to your pc, put on your lp (don't forget to clean the lp), and record! It's that simple with the ezvinyl software.<br /><br />There's also Audacity for more advanced use. I've been experimenting with it and it is working quite nicely. The audio quality using either ezvinyl or Audacity are very good. I was certainly pleasantly surprised at the sound quality.<br /><br />So far, so good. It is doing the job. I think I can safely recommend this turntable for those of you who are wanting to transfer your precious lp's to digital, be it cd's or ipod and such.

As an extreme Holmes fan, I was very guarded, but I found myself very much in love and more than happy with the outcome and the direction that they took the tale. Downey Jr. has long been one of my favorite actors and he has not failed to perform and to impress me in this production.  The cast, effects, cinematography, story, music etc. were all wonderful. It did display the grit and the earthiness of the characters, but it retained the brilliance of the masterpiece. Two thunbs up!
B001V7UXG2|3.0|Totally delightful series - we all know that:) - but the quality of DVD image is very disappointing - not totally awful: you just know it could be so much better!
B002SJIO5E|5.0|So now that I go that off my chest...wait, no I haven't.  I keep reading some of the \\"reviews\\" of this movie and just don't understand why so many people placed so much \\"hope\\" in District 9 and then were So Let Down.  IT'S A MOVIE!  But I think when all is considered here, such as the budget, the director  ( for that matter the lead character  has No acting experience before this production), and the absolute uniqueness of the entire effort, one has to re-weigh what ends up on the screen vs how it is judged.  That being said, you also have to Pay Attention to this movie.  Oh, and don't watch District 9 at home while the kids are running around screaming for dinner as you pause the DVD player over and over again.  This movie needs your consistent attention from start of end.  It's not deep, but it certainly isn't just a small plot with some \\"shoot 'em up\\" thrown in either.  It's a tale of redemption, so you sometimes have to read a little between the lines.  I have never said this next statement before when it comes to a motion picture, but here goes....A person with at least average intelligence will view District 9 and walk away with an improved sense of humanity.  The aura will then fade (like any other experience) and you will resume your life, like I did.  Shallow-minded viewers will....well never mind, I lost them a long time ago.  But You made it this far.  You got brains.  See this movie.  Give it your attention.  You'll like it, and you'll want to discuss it.  I promise.

B000OY454O|5.0|Nightclubbing is the best entry point for those wishing to investigate Ms Jones immediate post-disco phase. This 1981 album followed the previous year's groundbreaking Warm Leatherette and was a commercial triumph. More accessible than both Warm Leatherette and Living My Life, this second work in the Sly & Robbie trilogy is packed with outstanding songs of lyrical and melodic distinction. They include compositions by Bill Withers, Astor Piazzolla, Sting, David Bowie/Iggy Pop, Barry Reynolds and Grace herself. The sound is crystal clear and despite the Jamaican influences the album has a bohemian European air about it.<br /><br />Varied yet cohesive, Nightclubbing successfully explores different directions but gives the overall impression of a concept album. It is polished and sophisticated, displaying none of the raw edges of [[ASIN:B000001FU5 Warm Leatherette]] and offers a broader appeal than [[ASIN:B000001FU8 Living My Life]]. On the opening track Walking In The Rain Grace applies her semi-spoken vocal style over a light pop-reggae beat. Notorious for its risqu&eacute; lyrics, Pull Up To The Bumper with its jerking Jamaican rhythms and car horn samples is a perennial club favorite which has seen a multitude of remixes and covers down the years.<br /><br />The slower numbers are Bowie & [[ASIN:B000000WH7 Iggy's]] Nightclubbing which is sinister rather than celebratory and I've Done it Again which is romantic and soulful as opposed to the title track's menacing undertone. Speaking of which, her interpretation of Sting's Demolition Man takes menace to new dimensions; it's the most explicitly rock-influenced song here and packs a punch. Bill Withers' Use Me & her own composition Feel Up are both buoyant uptempo tracks, the first being a show of defiance with an infectious reggae beat and the second a Caribbean feast with rattling percussion, choral vocals, what appears to be flutes & whistles and a dialogue in French patois between Grace & a male vocal.<br /><br />The magnificent Art Groupie is the most poetic & literary track with a flowing rhythmic lilt and a synth that resembles the golden age of Human League or [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Eurythmics]]. Reggae meets an accordion on the bouncy Libertango, a catchy bilingual track on which Grace speaks and sings elegantly in French and English. The album concludes with the wistful ballad I've Done It Again where an introspective lyric and an understated sound create a delicate gem. In retrospect, Nightclubbing contains several tracks that resemble what ZE Records, the NYC label which was thriving at the same time, was pursuing. Artists like [[ASIN:B0002XB9IM Cristina Monet]] and Kid Creole made the exquisite types of music that this magnificent album offers in such abundance.<br /><br />The follow-up Living My Life concluded the Sly & Robbie trilogy and therewith the reggae & dub phase of her career. On her 1986 and 1989 albums -- [[ASIN:B00000718N Inside Story]] & Bulletproof Heart -- Ms Jones focused on soulful pop music. Then followed 19 years of silence. It was only in 2008 that Grace worked with Sly & Robbie again, on the challenging and ultimately rewarding [[ASIN:B001GAD7NA Hurricane]] where Brian Eno and Tricky count amongst the other contributors. In my opinion, Nightclubbing remains Grace's masterpiece, a work that best demonstrates her distinctive styles as vocalist, interpreter and composer via an exceptional set of songs.the most poetic & literary track with a flowing rhythmic lilt and a synth that resembles the golden age of Human League or [[ASIN:B0000CFXNP Eurythmics]].

0385341008|4.0|[[ASIN:0140143505 84, Charing Cross Road]]<br /><br />With over one thousand reviews, and 900+ rating the book either 4 or 5 stars, you can decide for yourself whether or not you'd like to read the book.  Although it took me a bit to get into the story as I had just finished Sarah's Key by Tatiana de Rosnay, I loved the book and now wish to travel across the pond and take the mail boat to Guernsey as did Juliet in the novel.<br /><br />This book reminds me of \\"84 Charing Cross Road\\" by Helene Hanff, which I read years ago but thoroughly loved.  84 is also told through correspondence letters between Hanff and Frank Doel, a bookseller in London whom Helene contacts in 1949, and the lifelong friendship between them.  You get a sense of literature as Helene is seeking books by Pepys and other classic authors, as well as what life was like in London after the war.  This is another gem, so if you enjoyed \\"The Guernsey Literary and Potato Peel Society,\\" seek out a copy of \\"84 Charing Cross Road.\\"

Susan Boyle is a Natural!
0810982862|3.0|It is really a shame.  One of the best movies I've seen, and one of the best collection of art from that movie is in this book, great details and descriptions and it gives you a general touch of the imagination of James Cameron... that's the good news.<br /><br />James Cameron and his crew should get in touch with the publisher immediately!!!!  So far I have two copies of this book, and both of them have bad binding.  The pages literally fell apart in the second week.  I bought a second copy, but one of the centerfold spreads was sliced instead of folded, and again the pages are popping out of the book.  Also the book cover jacket was not folded correctly.  Being a published Science Fiction writer myself and noticing some problems with my own works, I was able to correct with my publisher on any problems... This book has major binding problems.  Both copies were bought with three weeks in between so as not to get the same batch.<br /><br />If not for the pages falling out, this review would have been a full five stars.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|As I have said before in my criticism of this talented lovely Clive Davis discovery, Alicia Keys is more musician than singer. Her piano work is still light years ahead of her vocal ability. A full package, she is a crossover beauty that is built for a mass audience to love. I want her to go home again. Leave divadom behind and re-group to the pretty, cornrolled, yella tomboy we all was exposed to in her debut CD. Where has that raw urban talent gone? Bring back that girl. Before she gets stale, Keys needs to rid of the slickness she has acquired  and get back to her true urban self. I miss that side of her sooooooooooooooo much.<br />Aside from what I just said, the CD is aiight. All the radio airplay will shift on her once Sade drops her new CD. So, Keys had better know to go home for her next outing.
B000JQU1VS|5.0|Spending so much of my day plugged into the internet, peering at my iPhone, staring at Excel spreadsheets, it has been an absolute pleasure reading The Adventures of Sherlock Holmes(on my Kindle, I must admit). I am reminded, in adventure after adventure, that there is no substitute for a sharp mind and astute observation. As I watch the master investigator calmly solve the most \\"singular\\" of mysteries through the eyes of Dr. James Watson, I almost want to myself be transported back to 19th century London.<br /><br /> If you haven't read any of Conan Doyle's stories, they are worth perusing. I only read a dozen of Holmes' adventures. But in those stories, I grew intimately close with both the detective and his trusty sidekick and doctor-cum-biographer, Watson. I came to admire Holmes' heroic stoicism, encyclopedic memory, and sharp wit.<br /><br /> Each of the adventures follows a somewhat similar plot structure. The adventure opens with a shot into Watson's or Holmes' personal life. You might hear briefly about Watson's life as a doctor, or get a glimpse of Holmes' tobacco, alcohol, or cocaine habits (yes, the rumors are true--Holmes does cocaine). At some point, Watson ends up at Holmes' pad on Baker Street. Both men are then found lounging, Holmes in his \\"dressing gown,\\" both men likely smoking, drinking, and enjoying a fine meal, usually arms' length from a cozy fire.<br /><br /> Watson, the narrator, will then tell us how, in all of his time with Holmes, the case he is about to elucidate is the most \\"singular\\" one yet. Then one of them will see or hear someone approaching their home base; inevitably, the bell will ring and in will enter yet another all-but-hopeless client. We'll get a detailed description of the client's physical appearance, from the clothes on his or her back to the flushness of the face. We'll also always get an idea of what class the client falls into; most regularly, the clients are from higher classes. The client will give us a detailed account of his or her problems as Holmes and Watson listen intently. It is here that the reader is supposed to do the detective work to piece together clues to solve the case. Of course, most of what the client tells us seems unrelated and inane; Holmes will remind us that the simplest cases are the hardest ones, and the smallest of details often the most important.<br /><br /> In most cases, the client has a suspicion that the police's conclusions on the case were flawed. In almost every case, the police were consulted and ended up being wrong indeed. Holmes generally requires a trip to the crime scene, sometimes in costume, and the readers have the privilege to join him with Watson. But most trips are simply chances for Holmes to confirm what he already suspected. Guns may be drawn, extreme danger is almost always encountered, and Holmes emerges the hero. Holmes has a penchant for withholding his conclusions from us until the very end of the story, however, so as the reader follows Holmes' movements at the crime scenes, the reader must do some sleuthing as well.<br /><br /> Holmes will finally tell us what actually happened, and the seemingly innocuous clues from earlier in the chapter prove to be essential to the weaving of the truth. Holmes prefers to strike a deal with the crimes' perpetrators rather than offering them to the police. The clients offer to give Holmes unlimited reward for a job well done, and Holmes calmly requests only that which will defer the cost of his work. He gets enough pleasure out of a job professionally well-done.<br /><br /> Because of the similarities between stories, I recommend taking Holmes in limited doses. But his is a very powerful medicine, one that rejuvenates the mind and strengthens the character. As an example of someone who betters the world by doing what he loves, Sherlock Holmes is a timeless hero.count of his or her problems as Holmes and Watson listen intently.

B001ASVXSE|5.0|The strength and beauty of Oistrakh's playing is extremely well documented by this set. His sound is never excessively sweet which I think is wonderful. It is also worthwhile to watch DVDs of Oistrakh playing. Pure music coming from his brain and heart without theatrical body gestures and facial expressions.<br />Two DVDs I would recommend highly are EMI classical archives 33  with concertos by Brahms, Tchaikovsky, and Sibelius. The other is of David Oistrakh accompanied by Richter in Beethoven and Brahms sonatas on VAI. If you are new to listening to the classical violin these recordings are a wonderful place for you to start.
B001FB55HQ|2.0|This movie is all action, no talk! Well, some talk, but the action is so intense that the story and variety of scenes in this movie suffers greatly. Sam Worthington plays a character--Marcus--that seems to come out of nowhere. There was no mention of him in any of the three previous Terminator movies, and this movie seems to be mostly about him, even centered around him more than John Conner. And him getting hooked up with some hot babe in the desert was really CORNY and soap opera-ish. He's a machine, for crying out loud!    I was hoping that this movie would center around the start of the relationship between Kyle Reese and John Conner (father and son, you know), not this Markus dude. He played a noble character, but I thought it was an unnecessary addition to the grand Terminator tale. Hopefully the next sequel will hone in on Reese and Conner more.    As with a lot of action movies these days, this flick didn't have a lot of charm and variety to it. This is not entirely the fault of the screenwriters, of course, since the setting is, after all, post-Armageddon with everyone living like savages in constant misery and fear--not a lot of room for comic relief and witty one-liners as in Terminator 2. And of course, having no Ahnold (aside from a brief appearance of a Terminator of his likeness) just isn't the same! And Linda Hamilton is sorely missed as well! So obviously this flick isn't going to be as all-around entertaining as Terminator 2.    I thought all the scenes of the Resistance fighting the machines looked straight out of an Xbox or PS3 game, exuding that same vibe you feel when playing a video game. And that's fine for teenage boys, I'm sure, but I'd rather the movie seem more like a regular movie, overall.    So for hardcore Terminator movie fans, I wouldn't recommend against adding this movie to your collection, but I wouldn't call it a must-have, either.
1596680296|5.0|I love this book.  I am a new knitter and thought socks were going to be impossible.  Not with this book.   I like that she gives you basic yarn weights instead of specific yarns.  You can't always find those \\"specialty\\" yarns that most patterns tell you to use.  I have made at least 20 pairs of socks and slippers since I got this book....highly recommended to new knitters.
B0026P3G12|3.0|I have just now listened to this album having received it as a gift.  Boyle has an amazing voice.  She's a beast of a singer.  But these impressions come more from her live appearances than from this disk.  The disk demonstrates how clear and - at times - powerful her voice is, but the songs became a bit of a blur to me because they all seemed to have the same pace.  I heard this in the car all by myself and driving route 81 south it was a bit soporific.      \\"Wild Horses,\\" is terrific, but I prefer the live version from AGT by a wide margin.  The AGT version is sung in a lower key.  I think this key demonstrates the power in her voice better and also makes her voice more distinctive.  I think these songs are sung in fairly high keys because, as the first CD out of the gate, there was an effort to make her sound younger.  And she does sound young.  So, they succeeded in that.  I guess I'm a bit out of step with the parade on this point.    I'm no expert on voice and listening to voice professionals discuss Boyle is like listening to actors discuss Spencer Tracy's acting or baseball pitchers discuss pitching.  As a non-actor and non-pitcher, I can understand only so much.  But it's clear from what voice professionals and many singers say, that Boyle has 'it'.  This album seems to have reinforced and advanced their impressions.         It's great to own it, though and I'll be very interested to see what's on CD #2.
B002OR18HQ|5.0|Loved this DVD. John sounds great as usual. But dose anybody know if this or any of the other Fogerty concerts are going to be released on Blu-ray. Concerts on blu-ray just blow away standard DVD and this music just screams for it. I believe this was shot in hi-def, so it should be easy. Anyway, great show. go get it!
0312360258|1.0|I was shocked by the mature content of this book, and found it totally inappropriate for a youth audience.  The main character is marked to become a vampire and is transferred to a vampire high school of sorts. Shortly after arriving at the school, she witnesses one student performing oral sex on another.  As the story continues, there are several instances in which one of the main female characters pleasures herself, and marijuana is used durng a school-endorsed ritual.  The language is also exceptionally and unnecessarily crude, running the gamut of obscenities, including several references to genitalia.     In addition, for Christian parents out there, you should be aware of the anti-Christian themes running strongly throughout the book.  The author sets up a group called \\"People of Faith\\" to represent the Christian perspective and then portrays them as bigotted, ignorant baffoons. The main character's step-father, whom she refers to as the Step-Loser, is the principal Christian antagonist.  He is an Elder in the People of Faith and spouts an intolerance for many things from single women to Enya, as well as harboring an opinion that the main character was marked to be a vampire because of her bad nature, an opinion which is described as being unenlightened and at clear odds with the \\"science\\" behind vampirism. Christian worship services are compared to the numerous pagan worship services that are depicted in the book and are found to be lacking in sincerity (Zoey: \\"I'd never heard stuff like this in church before, and I sure as hell had never felt so energized there, either!\\"). The author's agenda in this regard is fairly transparent.
B002SJIO4A|1.0|This movie was boring , confusing and senseless, all the charaters were unlikable, I truly do not understand all the praise this move got from critics.It was to be a parody of racism, but they did a much better job with \\"alien nation\\" years before.

1400079179|2.0|This book was written at a surprisingly amateur level. This book wouldve been a much better read about 15 years ago, and i am 29 now.<br />The writing was so incredibly tame and a Geico caveman wouldve had no problem getting through this book.<br /><br />The characters were also so incredibly uninteresting. I did not care one bit for the two main protagonists. I didnt care if they lived or died since they had absolutely no back story in this book. The only character i enjoyed was Silas who seemed to be a poor ignorant man mislead by zealots. He would have been better served as an atheist who went to S&M shows to get his blood running.<br /><br />On the plus side, this book was a fast paced read and i was very curious as to what the holy grail was going to turn out to be. However, after the whole holy grail thing was explained i found myself going, 'huh?' and 'are you kidding me?'<br /><br />Good read for a high schooler. Not so much for an adult.
B00005U2JL|5.0|I couldn't listen to Manson at all before watching this; I thought his music was crap, but this DVD changed my mind completely. A lot of the songs are from Holy Wood, one of my favorites, and the others sound 1000x better than their studio versions. I get the impression it might have undergone a lot of engineering to get the quality of sound it has, but who cares, put on the headphones and crank it up!!
1594488843|5.0|Pink continues his mastery of researching big concepts to provide king sized insights, bite sized gems, and life changing tools. Wrapping this quick read with great humor, metaphors and inspiration richer and deeper than any self-help book, he crystalizes trends ahead of others for those yearning to maximize human resources or hoping to make their next day a better one. Drive is required reading for any grad student, CEO, or \\"nervously employed\\" worker seeking words and hope to explain why adapting to constant changing is the only constant. Pink's Free Agent Nation, A Whole New Mind, Johnny Bunko and now Drive are the most useful books I've read in terms of taking control of one's career, strengths, and situation since What Color is Your Parachute. Marcus Buckingham, Steven Covey and Tom Peters moved career management to a new level. Drive puts readers further down the road with greater wit, style and speed.
B002MBAJ4M|5.0|When I first heard Gov't Mule, I thought that they were just a little kickass blues rock trio in the vein of ZZ Top. They had some good riffs here and there, and Warren was a great singer/guitar player, but I've heard better bands and more memorable songs.<br /><br />That opinion has been flushed down the toilet with this release. To put it quite frankly, this is the best album Gov't Mule has EVER put out, and quite possibly one of the best rock and roll albums of 2009, possibly the decade even. It's all over the place. Barnstomping blues, Hendrix funk, soulful ballads, Led Zeppelin-inspired riffs, psychedelia, and the powerful vocals of Mr. Haynes. It's a fantastic album, and it FEELS like a rock album should sound like. There's a terrific flow to everything.<br /><br />Broke Down On The Brazos just kicks it. Boogie in the vein of ZZ Top (It even has Billy Gibbons playing guitar), this is one of the heaviest songs the band has ever created (Apart from a certain track I will talk about later in the review.). Warren and Billy tear it up for 6-plus minutes in one of the best guitar duels ever recorded.<br /><br />Steppin' Lightly is a song that reminds me of old-Mule, but the songwriting and pace of the song works, and it doesn't go into weird forgettable directions like some of the earlier stuff. It all feels right.<br /><br />Railroad Boy is a reworking of an old Celtic folk song, transformed into something Led Zeppelin would've done circa 1975.<br /><br />Monday Mourning Meltdown is a fine example of how Gov't Mule has progressed into an amazing BAND, and not just 3 guys backing Warren Haynes. Listen to the trippy keyboard work on this, it's a feast for the ears. And the backwards guitar solo! Just lovely.<br /><br />Gordon James is a fantastic southern ballad which reminds me of something Counting Crows would do. Lovely song, though I can't place just who it's about though.<br /><br />Any Open Window is just badassery. You know you're in for some funk when it's dedicated to Mitch Mitchell and Buddy Miles.<br /><br />Frozen Fear sounds like it would've easily fit onto a Derek Trucks record. While it's certainly the least fulfilling song on the album, it's still quite good, and that's saying a lot.<br /><br />Forevermore is a dark ballad with some interesting space noises. Very atmospheric song.<br /><br />Inside Outside Woman Blues #3.....WOAH! Warren lets his hair down with this one! This is borderline heavy metal. If you think Warren has softened over the years, listen to this song. It's just intense.<br /><br />Scenes From A Troubled Mind is a funky little song with some great slide work. Another keeper from a great album.<br /><br />And finally, World Wake Up is a dark psychedelic song about how our economy and our world is going down the crapper. It's a fantastic album closer, you could close your eyes and imagine Pink Floyd doing this were it not for the southern accented vocals.<br /><br />This album has it all. Great songs, terrific playing, showmanship, amazing tones, variety. It's just a perfect album.

0756405890|2.0|That shouldve been the title of this book.<br /><br />SPOILERS<br /><br />The Doogie Howser of the magic world goes to high school and meets his first bully and his first girlfriend. Thats it. Thats the entire book summed up right there. Nothing happens in 500 of the 600 pages and characters have no personality. I really could not tell Kvothes two best friends apart at all.<br /><br />The main character is also extremely unlikable. He is an arrogant know it all and has the most ridiculous dialogue and vocabulary of any young teen i have every known/read. Kvothe reminds me of the teenager who thinks he is invincible but wraps his first car around a pole and dies at the age of 18. Its amazing how Kvothe survives past 14.<br /><br />Also, the token dragon rears his head at the end, out of the blue, without one word of magical lizards throughout the previous 500 pages. The dragon destroying a town scenario reminded me of the Hobbit where another persons meddling made a dragon attack a helpless town.<br /><br />All in all this was a terribly slow read and a lot of nothing happens in this tome of a book. Highly overrated.<br /><br />Im giving this book its second star because Rothfuss uses some big words.

B002RI9UKE|2.0|I am a book junkie and I was really excited to read this book. But this book made me rather mad. Not because I did not do the steps but it just worked when I wished for a tomato that tasted good.... But when I wished for something I really wanted it did not work or if it was, like my kindle, I did it after my mom told me I was getting one.....   do believe there is power is postive energy and saying you can do this but don.t get your hopes up. And for that I ddi not need this book my mom has be tellling me the whole 11 years of my life.  When you first read it you think it will ma.ke such a difference in your life. Here is the main message in ghis book with for what you want nad believe you have it and you will get it. And it says this over and over. And if you believet his will happen, use shooting stars and believe they have magic, it works for me for alomost every wish I make on a shooting star (other then  wish  had amgical powers ) it works and in a way hats what this book is telling us, not the shooting star part but the believe and wish part.   My advice just use the stars !
B0011UBDTK|3.0|SATC is a great show, but this sex is way too expensive. I bought each complete season separately for less than 70 bucks, and this costs 200? That seems a little excessive. If it were Bluray format, I could see the price. Also, many people complain that the packaging scratches DVDs, which I can see. If it were Bluray, it wouldn't scratch so easily and there would be less disks to manage. That only thing I didn't get with my solo seasons is that bonus DVD with the games and such, which I don't really care about. It's not worth 130 extra for one bonus DVD.
B002NXSRW0|4.0|I loved the actors whom played Snake Eyes and Storm Shadow, they got their characters down to a 'T'!     The rest of the movie however, so-so, the story line could use a bit of tweaking.
B002L3RVCY|5.0|I loved the original Star Wars, but I wasn't a huge fan of Episodes I-III (though the last was much better).  And the screenshots of this animated series didn't do anything for me.  I wasn't really hyped to see the series, but after watching the first disc I can say this is the most fun I've had in the Star Wars universe since waiting in line for the opening of Episode I.  Too bad that film didn't live up to the expectation.  This would have.  It's great and I cannot wait for more.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I, for one, am very impressed with Sting's current musical path and I plan to support him on it, with my $ and my word of mouth. Sting is clearly bored with rock and pop, as he should be---nothing much happening there and he's been there, done that. I was growing bored with Sting's solo career, despite his good music and even better lyrics. But this has brought me back: this is one of his most creative efforts and that is saying something for this man. He shows that one doesn't have to compose music to make it original; his blending of sound (particularly the Webb Sisters) shows a man who is not afraid to see how far he can go to flex his musical muscles. Only one drawback to this CD: Sting's vocals are too throaty and he doesn't seem to have the same range as shown in his previous work. But I can live with that as he is still vocally superior to most of what we are stuck hearing from the music industry. 5 stars! Great work, Sting!
0553573403|5.0|I was familiar with GRRM's work in the \\"Wild Cards\\" series, so when friends recommended this series so heavily to me, I already knew the man could write. I was just a bit shy about committing what seemed like a year of my life to reading this epic series. With board games, card games, miniature figures, and a television series on the horizon, I finally got around to \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" afraid that I would have the series spoiled for me if I didn't get started.<br /><br />Now, I'm both glad I did and annoyed I don't already have the second volume. My expectations were set pretty high, and they were well exceeded. Still, there are some caveats.<br /><br />1 - This is a HUGE fantasy series. I know that. Anyone approaching it should know that. I think some of the complaints that the books are \\"too long\\" or that the first book doesn't wrap anything up are just cases of flawed expectations. To say that Tolstoy, Homer, or Tokien accomplished more in fewer pages is just silly. GRRM is using the number of pages he needs to tell his story, as every author should. This doesn't make his story better or worse, just longer.<br /><br />2 - This is not high fantasy. There aren't fair maidens, noble knights, loveable elves, or any other stock fantasy trope. There is no messianic wizard mentor character to battle the Balrog or get shaved and sacrificed to save the soul of the traitor. This is a gritty world with no mercy. That is not to say that GRRM is particularly sadistic or cruel. The tone is more comparable to the histories of Rome or the historical works of Bernard Cornwell than to C.S. Lewis or David Eddings, who write a gentler brand of fantasy. This is not young reader-freindly, as a fair amount of sex, violence, and profanity is found throughout. Again, not a case of better or worse, just of creative choice.<br /><br />3 - The book itself (and the rest of the series, I imagine) is structured in a very specific fashion. Chapters are not numbered. They are titled with the viewpoint character for that chapter, and in \\"A Game of Thrones,\\" there are a good half dozen of them or more. This worked very well for me, because I tend to read on my breaks at work, and the length of chapters seemed to correspond to a good 15-minute break, allowing me to read a chapter and at a glance, see who we would be catching up with next. This built anticipation such that I was often eagerly awaiting my next break so I could see the resolution to a problem set up the last time Character X was the focal point.<br /><br />This also allows GRRM to mix tones and writing styles. A lot of the \\"soap opera\\" melodrama that GRRM is criticized for stems from the simple fact that a number of the viewpoint characters in \\"A Game of Thrones\\" are children, who view everything with either blind optimism or tragic melancholy, and an astute reader will be able to find the truth of a matter somewhere in between. There are also many cases of unreliable narrators, even though the book is written in a third-person style. Not everything everyone claims or says should be taken at face value, and this actually supports a crucial theme of the book.<br /><br />These viewpoint characters are hardly immune to injury or death, as well, and that should keep readers on their toes throughout the series, though some find that they can find no one to connect with since everyone is potentially \\"on the chopping block.\\" I'm not afraid to emotionally invest in characters who may very well die, however, since I find that to be more engaging than the constant, invincible protagonist. I'm willing to get choked up over a fictional character's demise after I've invested 500+ pages in their struggle. Others may be annoyed by that, so fair warning given.<br /><br />So, over all, I was thrilled and satisfied, but I understand why others would be completely turned off by it. If this sort of series is not your cup of tea, by all means, stay away from it, because 900 pages is far too much to invest in something you're not going to enjoy. If you think there's a fair chance you'll enjoy something like this, however, then go for it, because I find \\"A Game of Thrones\\" to be about as accomplished in its field of epic fantasy as you're going to find.ir chance you'll enjoy something like this, however, then go for it, because I find \\"A Game of Thrones\\" to be about as accomplished in its field of epic fantasy as you're going to find.
0783225482|3.0|This is a great movie and I just saw it again on HBO in Wide-screen format.  I decided to purchase the DVD but could not find it in Wide-screen, only in Full-screen format.  I checked Blue Ray but it isn't available in that format at all. Anyone know if the Wide-screen version is available anywhere, besides HBO?
0321127420|3.0|I'm surprised to see here that the first edition, which I just finished reading after letting it collect dust for several years, is still the current edition on the market.  Seven years in the software development industry is a long time, and I feel that this book could use some refactoring.  (I couldn't resist.)  For example, the book refers to a \\"Plugin\\" pattern because \\"dependency injection,\\" an industry-wide practice of decoupling interfaces from implementations and configuring them at runtime, hadn't become a common term at the time the book was written.  The \\"service stub\\" pattern, one of whose benefits is described as enhanced testing, is now better known as mock objects, and this book doesn't mention the tools and libraries that have sprung up around generating mock objects to facilitate more insular unit testing.  Finally, when discussing object-to-relational-database mapping patterns, the book makes recommendations about \\"buying\\" one but makes no mention of solid open source solutions available like Hibernate.    The book's loosely edited style and almost chatty, informal delivery prevents it from attaining the academic perfection that the original \\"instant classic\\" Gang of Four design patterns book earned.  There is frequent phrasing like \\"my preference,\\" \\"here at ThoughtWorks,\\" and (my favorite) \\"at the moment I don't have a strong opinion either way.\\"  Martin Fowler is cool, and is a renowned software personality, which makes it easy to tolerate the familiarity, but at times I wished for slightly more rigorous editing.    The book's examples are a blend of Java and C#, and while this works fairly well to present a language-agnostic view of the patterns, this book doesn't avoid an occasional platform-specific side trail (like the judicious use of Enterprise Javabeans vs. plain Java objects).  This sort of indiscretion has often marred patterns books that would otherwise have achieved more timelessness (for example, the book \\"Pattern Hatching,\\" a followupto the classic Design Patterns books, spent an entire thick middle chapter dealing with workarounds to problems that occur only in C++).    Some of the patterns in this book would not have been hard to come up with: if you've built a vertical slice of a multitier enterprise application, you've almost certainly developed some of these patterns on your own.  The value of patterns literature, of course, is in how it increases our shared design vocabulary, and to the extent that it helps us know what we mean when someone talks about \\"doing it with a Table Data Gateway,\\" this book is a worthy addition to the literature.  Overall, though, for me the book was less a series of profound \\"aha!\\" experiences and more of a catalog of \\"so that's what that's called\\" moments.  A decent effort, but the new reader should be aware that it would benefit from some updates.
B002MW50KO|5.0|OK, Bob Dylan's voice has a unique rasp that has become more noticeable over time, but his voice also offers a deep set of emotions and he plays it straight and sweet. This is a fabulous and nostalgic delight. There's not a dud on the disk, and several of them are sublime.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|I recieved this as a Christmas gift from my nieces and nephews (AWWW!!)   and I have watched it three times now to date and I love it!    What more can I say other than as both a musician and admirer of Jimmy Paige,   The Edge and Jack White's work, I found this to be a great interaction and you could   feel the mutual respect that each of these 3 decades of guitar giants had for each other.  When Paige broke into \\"Whole Lotta Love\\" and other classic Zeppelin stuff,   The Edge and Jack White both looked like Wayne & Garth in their basement headquarters   with wide-eyed gleeful grins saying AWESOME DUDE!!  Each individual guitar icon is given a platform for their backstory to be told  (for those who don't know already!) and we get to visit and view locations which  were crucial to their development. Alot of this I already knew, but for the youngsters  who are just learning about Paige, The Edge and Jack White, it's cool.   My summation: Plenty of good playing, conversation, backstory, etc.,   and I can't say anything better than what the other positive reviewers have already said.   A worthwhile DVD for guitar players and rock music lovers!   I liked it so much that I bought 4 extra copies this past   weekend to give to some musican friends of mine.
0385504225|2.0|It's a book that if you are not well informed on the Freemasons you will read this book in front of your computer to help you decipher most of the information.  Don't misunderstand me it's a great chase and codebreaking story but once again Langdon is lectured and then \\"everything makes sense\\" or he see's the picture, even while facing death.  You will also get a history lesson that i'm pretty sure if we had paid attention in high school we would know what and where they are talking about. It does make you want to visit Washington D.C. which is amazingly full of mysteries and hidden history and awesome art and architecture. Langdon gets a call to lecture in Washington D.C. but when he gets there he realizes that his friend is missing or rather kidnapped. A severed tattoed hand in the rotunda,at the precise moment Robert Langdon gets there and gets one of the many phone calls of the night, the CIA who decides it's a matter of national security and on a need to know basis and you don't need to know, and a mysterious man who taunts and orders Robert Langdon around via cell phone, A couple of 33rd degree freemasons a pyramid( here is where knowledge of Masonry comes in hand) the kidnapped Peter Salomon sister Katherine and a few other people who really don't make sense as to what they are doing there but that is part of Dan Brown's way of writing adding unecessary characters. You will also know exactly where you are even if you have Never been to the Nations Capital. Noetic Sciences play a rather confusing role in this story but it really doesn't give you much information you need to look it up too and by the way it really isn't a science at least I didn't think so. The history of the Freemasons was rather interesting but being a woman there is no way I would be able to join them. Good thing I did not pay full price I got it believe it or not on clearance for a fraction of the cost. Would I read it again? Most likely not.
B002LMV7TS|5.0|We got this very fast.  I didn't even know there was a DVD and a Blu-Ray when I ordered it so I was very surprised and pleased.  We can now watch it in the car and at home.
B001Q94TQA|5.0|Since Once is only available in the US on DVD, I purchased the blu-ray through Amazon UK for less (including delivery) than most blu-ray and some DVD movies cost in the US.  The package arrived at my home in about a week with standard delivery.  It shipped through Royal Mail and was delivered by the US Postal Service.        Consistent with reviews I had read online before purchasing:  the movie played flawlessly, but the extra features did not work.  I was prepared for this outcome and am pleased to have the film in HD. As expected, the picture quality is clearly superior to the DVD version. I have seen some report their blu-ray unit is able to play the extra features.  I have not seen reviews stating the movie does not work.  I'm using a Sony BDP-S350 blu-ray player with up-to-date firmware.      Note:  at the writing of this review a US version of the blu-ray is not available.  If you purchase through any US reseller, it will be an imported version.    As for the film itself, the story is grounded and simple--yet remarkably interesting.  The music is absolutely gripping.  I typically hate musicals, but this is not your typical musical.  This ultra-low budget film deserves the nearly perfect score it's tallied on the Rotten Tomatoes website.  As a bonus for me, it was filmed in fantastic Dublin City where I have many fond memories from business trips.
160094048X|5.0|I'm much more of a \\"cookie person\\" than a \\"cupcake person.\\"  I can appreciate the qualities of an adorable and delicious miniature cake, but cookies are my idea of the perfect treat.     I bought this book not only to keep my recipes collection from this fantastic duo of cookerinas (veganesses?) current, but also because of the lure of vegan lemon bars. How long I have waited! Our lemon bar effort turned out to be super-lemony and beautiful like glass. The crust burned a bit but lemon conquers all. A replacement for my ancient, inscrutable oven might also conquer a few things, but I can endure this sort of hardship for a while longer.    We also got \\"fancy\\" with the Peanut Butter Chocolate Pillows. Twice. The second time was a double batch (48 cookies got eaten just as quickly as 24 did). This cookie is a CLEAR favorite of the PB+Chocolate lovers (which seems to be everyone we know...hmmm). It's a big hands-on extravaganza to make these, but the work is fun with a friend, and there is definite reward and glory.  The glory comes when the hordes praise you and the reward comes when you remember to stash a few cookies away for your private enjoyment.    I'm pretty sure we'll eventually get past the Pillows to make every recipe in this book. The book is a gem.  Thanks again, ladies!

B002SJIO5E|2.0|Careful with what people say here.  Anyone who says \\"This is the best film of the year\\" or \\"The best film ever\\" cast a skeptic eye on those comments.  No way this is better than \\"Star Trek\\", \\"Public Enemies\\" or \\"Avatar\\"  This is clearly a grade 'B' sci fi along the lines of \\"Cloverfiled\\"  To save money on production costs, you are not even shown a clear, hi-def image of the space ship until near the end.  Not the best screenwiting either in my opinion.  You are mostly jostled around as a third party video cam reporter.  This does not lend to very much replay value since you never really feel engaged.  Save a few dollars on a potential dog in your collection by renting this first like I did and see if you like it enough to buy it.

B002VECMAY|4.0|I managed to see a very good movie over the weekend. The film, Up in the Air, has garnered some great reviews, so I figured it was time to take a break from all the football bowls and head for the theater. Great flick, but beware Up in the Air will leave you down in the dumps. George Clooney plays corporate downsizing expert Ryan Bingham and his job is to travel around the country and hand out pink slips to the sad and sometimes disgruntled corporate employee.If that isn't depressing enough, Clooney will make it even tougher on you, the moviegoer, as he plays his part so well that you actually begin to feel sorry for him. There are great lines in the movie and chances are you will find yourself laughing out loud on more than one occasion. But I'll warn you again, you won't be leaving the movie house, clicking up your heels.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|The worst of the them being boring. This is not even a film. It's a no budget peice of crap that can only be blamed on the decade that worships reality televison. It's an isnsult that a video home movie like this gets to have a theatrical run where decent films like Trick R Treat get a straight to DVD release.
B0025KVLRO|5.0|The Beatles' first album was largely recorded in one day. An unbelievable performance by today's standards. Then when you are listening to the music, which sound incredibly tight, inspired and accomplished, you may be in lack of words. Breathtaking<br /><br />Most of the numbers were inherited from the group's live material, and this is obviously part of the reason that they were able to record in such a short time.<br /><br />It should be mentioned,  in the name of truth,  that four numbers originated from previously released singles.<br /><br />Eight tracks are Lennon / McCartney originals, including the singles \\"Love Me Do\\" and \\"Please Please Me\\" which had already been in the charts at the time of the album release. The obvious or single-choice \\"I Saw Here Standing There\\", did not come out in the UK, but was released several places in Europe and the following year also in the United States. John Lennon's vocal tour de force performance of \\"Twist and Shout\\" was also released only outside the UK. In the US it reached the number two spot - in fact \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\" managed to do the same in 1964 - a bit more surprising, I should say.<br /><br />Apart from Ringo's vocal on \\"Boys\\" and partly George's on \\"Do You Want to Know a Secret\\" it is in particular the vocals that are impressing; both individually and in harmony.<br /><br />Highlights are Lennon's vocals on \\"Anna\\", \\"Ask Me Why\\" and not least on \\"Baby It's You\\" and the Twist and Shout \\".<br /><br />McCartney shines on \\"I Saw Here Standing There\\" and \\"PS I Love You \\". George performing lead vocals works fine on \\"Chains\\" and together they are terrific on \\"Misery\\" and \\"There's a Place\\".<br /><br />Finally it should be mentioned, that without a producer like George Martin, it would never have possible to create a milestone like this under such circumstances.
B000FA5TTW|4.0|I originally heard about this book from a former student of mine who mentioned it was a good book, but also easy to pick up and begin reading.  Also, I knew the motion picture was coming out soon and I like many other readers enjoy reading a book prior to viewing the movie version.      I was instantly hooked after reading the sample chapters for this book which is surprising for me because I generally put my leisure reading off, but I couldn't do that to do this book.  I really loved chapter to chapter and although some were more like \\"filler\\" chapters most were entertaining.    It's a bookworthy selection for most age groups and those who are still intrigued and bothered by child killers & their victims & their family.  So, download it--you won't be disappointed!
B0026P3G12|4.0|This is a great album for a Sunday morning, not a Saturday night.  The liner notes will explain the tone -- she is still getting over how she has been treated (or at least the producers wanted to highlight that).  I am enjoying it and will listen to it a lot but agree with others that Susan has a lot of talent that has yet to be tapped.  I look forward to her next album, which I hope will better highlight the full range of her vocal power and be infused with more joy.
B002R0F3Q2|3.0|I Love Alicia Keys, except her first album, which was too ghetto for my taste. I have to say; Diary of Alicia Keys is still her best of all albums. This one was very different from her original songs. The theme remains the same about Love and life, ( must be her thang) Overall, I am a fan and I have enjoyed maybe 5 songs with the exception of her duo with Beyonce. It could have been better though. But like I said, I am a fan...
0765316889|5.0|Brandon Sanderson is one of my favorite authors. I thought this trilogy was very inventive and different. A great read!
B000B0WODA|5.0|I had mentioned in my review about this band's previous album about how i looked forward to more of their stuff, whether they were in for more releases or just for the time being in 2004.  Luckily, this 2nd album does just that, & actually surpassed my expectations... i listened to the 1st album way too much in the summer of '04, & then i ended up liking this album even more.  I've seen some random comments from other fans that prefer this album, but other people will prefer one of the other 2... so to each their own.  I thought the big thing that made this 1 stand out from the 1st album was just simply more variety (yet another user commented about lack of variety on this album??? Disagree!!!).<br /><br />1 - The Fallen - like the 1st album, more toe-tapping goodness... but with a little more punch & hip shake factor ;-)<br />2 - Do You Want To - as a single, i didn't think this was the strongest pick... but it's a fun song nontheless.<br />3 - This Boy - whoa, 2:20 minutes is rarely this much fun!<br />4 - Walk Away - & then surprisingly, all that energy calms down to this... & then i had quickly realized the 1st album was missing good down tempo songs like this.<br />5 - Evil & a Heathen - mmmm, just like track 3, these 2 minutes are even more fun!  1 of my favorites<br />6 - You're the Reason I'm Leaving - back to the 1st album, more relationship woes...<br />7 - Eleanor Put Your Boots On - a genuine slow song, & they make it work!  it also became 1 of my favorites on here<br />8 - Well that was Easy - starts off like a song on the 1st album, but then changes tempo... which keeps it interesting, along with catchy \\"Oooooooooo\\"'s<br />9 - What You Meant - another 1 of my favorites... has a few different sides to its 3 minutes<br />10 - I'm Your Villain - i dig the catchy twangy guitars<br />11 - You could have it so much better - a little more drive... feels good to crank up while driving out of a parking lot *grin*<br />12 - Fade Together - another genuine slow song... also very noteworthy.  It chills out the end of the album very nicely.  I found it funny how my favorite songs on here were all the slow songs when i was initially drawn to the band's energy to begin with.  I should also mention this track always reminds me of that old song by The Turtles - Happy Together ;-)  It has a similar vibe without the dynamic buildup of The Turtles' song.<br />13 - Outsiders - a cool hip-shaking closer!<br /><br />If someone's wondering which FF album to start with, i'd say either this one or the 1st.  The 3rd is good, but just not as good as these 2, imho... Interpol & other bands of this decade fall in this 3rd album trap, it seems like.  If you like this, also check out albums by The Rapture, VHS or Beta, Kasabian, The Rakes, & my newer musical crush, Friendly Fires.d of the album very nicely.

B0026P3G12|5.0|Sorry, but I have to make this fast.    This is a positively wonderful CD. Susan has a way of making every song a thing of crystal clear beauty while also putting her own signature on it. For instance the Monkee's song \\"Daydream Believer\\". Now, we all know this piece as really catchy, semi-upbeat and beloved. I at first envisioned Susan trying to boldly bounce through it like the original but she certainly did not. The song was still as wonderful as ever but she turned it into a gentle, smooth and relaxing thing of beauty. She is truly gifted and magical [in my opinion]. Which is what this review is supposed to be, right?     Gotta run.   T'care,  Mike
B00284BMBM|4.0|Daughtry is of course the band spearheaded by bald headed Chris Daughtry, he of some success in an American Idol contest a few years ago. And you know what - when I was 16 I would never have listened to anybody remotely associated with that program. But the honest and simple hard rock of the band won me over on their visit to Sydney, Australia, and the debut album was an excellent slice of post grunge hard rock that I felt could sit comfortably in amongst the whole Nickelback/Creed scenario (with a dash of Hinder as a chaser).<br /><br />And certainly the band has a hard line to walk. They have to be mindful of the fact that it's mostly females who vote on things like Idol and that a) they aren't going to want things to get too crazy and b) a girls taste is going to change significantly between the ages of 13 and 15! Not to mention the fact that if they actually wanna tour and sell albums to guys they have to put enough meat on the bone to get all those male Nickelback/Creed/Hinder fans to part with their hard earned. Now when I was younger I would not have grasped that and would not have given the simple yet honest fare this album represents a chance.<br /><br />For simple and honest it is and that is not meant as a dismissal. The very first song lets you know that these guys like to crank their guitars. They come across as a band who enjoy the odd power chord, who enjoy being loud and with Chris' singing style often likened to `shouting' in a number of reviews this is probably a fair way to go. The albums production qualities allow things to breath and aid connectivity by ultimately making this album sound like everything else it's supposed to sound like. The pacing of the album shows thought in the way the gears go up and down slightly and it does aid end to end playback. All of which further impresses me in regards to this bands professionalism and that of their management/spin doctors.<br /><br />Now kids, if all you wanted to read was praise then you'll have to satisfy yourselves with the first three paragraphs because this is the paragraph where I explain why it's only just four stars. So you've been warned OK? Now of course I suppose this album will struggle to have the same `first time' spark the debut had and as I pointed out in my review of the debut the palette was pretty narrow in terms of variety. This album unfortunately continues in the same vein by serving up endless relationship based lyrics. I mean seriously - what are they trying to be? Ronan Keating with guitars? There is a whole universe out there full of amazing and horrible man made and natural things. All sorts of ideas floating around and a zillion things that an artist could bounce ideas off. So why on earth would you put out an album with 12 tracks and every one about the same thing just with the sentiments slightly altered every four minutes or so?<br /><br />Well that's my rant, overall I found this an album that very much succeeds in what it is trying to do and I hope that the project keeps on rolling on - I'm old enough now not to resent how talent is found, just as long as it is. And I feel these guys are a real rock `n' roll band. They just need more variety lyrically and to have the gumption to spread their wings musically on their next outing. Which I'll definitely be buying.th the first three paragraphs because this is the paragraph where I explain why it's only just four stars. So you've been warned OK?

B002SJIO5E|1.0|I have read/watched fantasy/SF for more than 30 years.  The story line was absurd.  The format (pseudo-docu) was off-putting.  The prawns are revolting to look at and not worth taking the time to understand, and the humans are one-dimensional cardboard.  After an hour I had no sympathy or interest in any of the characters or what passed for a plot.      Save your money and use it to take someone you love to see Avatar instead.
B001OQCV60|4.0|Let me begin by saying this is written from the perspective of someone who has long been a major fan of Arthur Conan Doyle's original Sherlock Holmes stories. They were some of the first non-children's works I ever read, and it was a yearly ritual to read them all consecutively. I did so for a long time and have read them on other occasions in various combinations. I thus unsurprisingly approached the film with a highly critical eye and a perhaps more than healthy dose of skepticism. As with many fans of the stories, Holmes is more real to me than many real people, and I would take any faulty adaptation very seriously - almost personally. I am therefore very glad to say I was pleasantly surprised.     Perhaps the most important thing to note is that it aims at both those familiar with the stories and those who have never read them, probably the latter primarily. This will inevitably annoy some purists but was necessary to gain wide appeal and, in my view at least, a nice balance was achieved. Some have complained that very little background is given at the front, apparently assuming it is known to all. However, everything is clear well before the end, and hard-cores will appreciate their time not being wasted. Far more important to fans is that the film does not follow a specific Doyle story. The general background is used, including of course the characters, but the chronology is somewhat changed; for example, a difference in how Watson meets his wife and moves from Baker Street threw me at first. Elements of various tales are used here and there, but this is essentially a new mystery. Any hard-cores limiting themselves to canonical plot adaptations thus should not even bother - but they will be missing out. The mystery is a Doyle-esque classic and, while not coming close to the master's best, the honest must admit it is quite a bit better than his worst. Anyone who loves the stories will find much to appreciate, as many classic elements are used. It is even an unexpected treat for hard-cores in some ways, as they can experience suspense and entertainment not possible when the plot is known.    There are many other non-canonical elements; most are essentially neutral, but hard-cores will quibble to various extents. For example, as nearly always in Hollywood adaptations, there is a significant action increase. It may not be hyperbole to say there is more action - in the Hollywood sense - than in all the stories combined. I feared this, and what I heard and saw made me worry it would ruin the film. However, at least in my view, it thankfully does not. It is not pushed too far and, though sometimes improbable, is not more so than in some stories - and is certainly mild compared to most films. The fact that non-Holmes fans have complained there is too little action testifies to this. Some hard-cores have complained loudly, but it is all fairly well integrated; there is really nothing gratuitous and contrived. It is also important to remember that the stories have a fair amount of action; some were indeed almost the equivalent of Hollywood action films by Victorian standards. This is easy to forget, and some would apparently like to deny it. It is also worth noting, for what it is worth, that Doyle could hardly have gotten away with such a thing in his time and place. For all we know, he was holding back and would have fully approved of this.    Hollywood is also infamous for sexing up literature, which is done here to a far lesser extent. No actual sex is shown, but there is significantly more suggestiveness than in the stories. In particular, Holmes' implied love for Irene Adler - a major character here despite appearing in only one story and being mentioned in a few others - is made fairly clear. This is shown in various ways that, while incredibly mild by Hollywood standards, may be too much for some hard-cores. However, this again is skillfully made to arise naturally and is after all plausibly extrapolated from the stories.Doyle was even more cramped here and may well have sketched the relationship out far more if he could have. More importantly, in contrast to the action, we can see the director and writers consciously holding back and should appreciate it.    The other non-canonical elements are essentially subjective; any given one will annoy some hard-cores while leaving others unfazed. I swallow most of them whole, and none annoy me particularly. The most obvious and significant is the increased importance of Dr. Watson despite the story not being told from his point of view as nearly always in Doyle. He is far more active, especially in regard to action, and beefed up in other ways - not least in becoming a witty wisecracker. Holmes is certainly the central focus, but Watson threatens to steal the proverbial show at times and is never deemphasized as in the stories. This can only be blasphemy to those who believe Holmes should dominate but works in context. Those able to see the film as a film in itself, rather than mere appendage of the stories, can appreciate this. Those unable to will be disappointed, but even they should not let it ruin what is a very worthy adaptation. Remaining changes are mostly added personality quirks of little or no consequence spread out among the characters. They have no real effect on plot except in a scene where Holmes drinks wine that has been fixed by Adler after she has more or less seduced him. I do not believe the \\"real\\" Holmes would be so easily fooled, but this is nothing to quibble too much about; ditto for whatever bothers anyone else.    All this is of course irrelevant to those unfamiliar with the stories, who will probably enjoy the film even more. It is a well-wrought mystery and certainly far above standard Hollywood mystery or action/adventure fair. One would have to look unusually hard to find plot holes, and no major threads are left dangling. Despite a slow start, the picture soon becomes engaging and entertaining and never lets up. The uninitiated will get a great introduction to Holmes and Doyle, as well as the time and place, and hopefully be inspired to read the originals.    The film is an excellent adaptation in most respects. Director Guy Ritchie does a superb job of bringing Victorian London alive. His depictions are of course not always what I picture but are nearly always legitimate and evocative; the sights and sounds have that all-important \\"right\\" feel, and the cinematography is generally well-done. The music is basically effective and appropriate but occasionally overblown and arguably distracting. Ritchie's greatest accomplishment, though, is avoiding the corniness that so often plagues and nearly always ruins Holmes onscreen. Holmes is one of the most famous fictional characters and has been portrayed many times nearly from the beginning of cinema; making him and his world seem fresh and convincing is a significant accomplishment.    The real key is of course the acting, which is basically excellent. I had major doubts about the casting of all the main characters and was glad to be proven wrong. Robert Downey, Jr. certainly does not look like Holmes as I picture him or as nearly always depicted, and little effort was made to change this. Yet it works. This is undoubtedly due mostly to the fresh approach. Ritchie decided not to go with the famous coat and hat, which was probably a good idea; it had been done too often and had arguably become almost inherently corny. Downey, Jr. uses actual acting skills to portray Holmes convincingly; his British accent is dead-on, and he has the mannerisms down well. Holmes' observational skills are put forth well, though his explanations often go by so fast we have little time to appreciate them, in contrast to the stories, where we can reread and savor. All told, I was thoroughly impressed by Downey, Jr.'s Holmes.    Jude Law as Watson is at least as good. He has performed well in each film I have seen him in, but I just could not envisionhim as Watson. How glad I was, then, to see him be an excellent one. That he looks nothing like himself clearly helps, even though his Watson is significantly different from how I have always pictured the character as well as from most depictions. Freshness again pays off, and Law deserves credit for pulling off a role substantially different from most of what he has done. The closest thing to a complaint one can make about his performance is that he sometimes comes near stealing Downey, Jr.'s proverbial thunder.     The biggest worry for me was Rachel McAdams as Adler. I questioned the validity and effectiveness of enlarging the character in the first place. Apparently it is not enough for her to be crafty and beautiful (I see nothing in McAdams, but I guess that's just me); she also had to be nearly as physically tough as Law's Watson and with even less canonical basis. Casting her on top of this seemed a sure recipe for disaster - nay, a cheap lure for non-Holmes fans. Again, though, I was pleasantly surprised. Her performance is not great - certainly below Downey, Jr.'s and Law's - but more than adequate. She does not quite convey the intelligence and craftiness the character demands and fails to sound like someone from New Jersey but is at least basically convincing. A more appropriate choice could probably have been found, but she passes my rather strict standards and does not come anywhere near ruining the film.    The minor actors are also quite good. Eddie Marsan deserves special mention for a humorous Inspector Lestrade. Mark Strong and Robert Maillet make convincing villains even if they lean toward the overly melodramatic. Their roles push non-canonical elements near the breaking point and sometimes come dangerously near corniness. However, while this brings down the film slightly, it does not ruin it.    The ending is a shameless sequel ploy, but we should not be offended; not only is the film well-done, but the Holmes world is so vast that there is plenty of room for more. Many, many elements are not touched on or used only in passing, and it would be interesting to see them further developed. Even hard-cores who thoroughly enjoy the film will inevitably miss certain scenes and characters - including Holmes' brother Mycroft, who is mentioned but does not appear, and arch-nemesis Professor Moriarty, who has only a token role. I am personally glad of this last, as adaptations have almost invariably overplayed Moriarty's importance, leading to a gross exaggeration of his stature. He is after all only physically present in one story, plays a real role in only one more, and is mentioned in a further handful. It is time that he stopped overshadowing other characters and situations. The promised sequel will surely feature him prominently, but I am more than willing to give it a chance after this success.    In summary, I urge any ambivalent Holmes fans to see this; whatever prior adaptations may have been, this is a good one. It is not perfect, and there will of course be many things you will wish had been different. You will quibble and nitpick. However, it is a quality adaptation, and you should let yourself enjoy it. This can be easily done in regard to the stories - there are plenty of tit-bits thrown in for the discerning that will be unnoticed by casuals - and is even easier if we take the film on its own terms. It is of course very hard to do the latter when dealing with such famous material, but the film is good enough that we should try. No honest person can say it is truly great cinema, but then Doyle's Holmes is not truly great literature in the strict sense. However much we enjoy it, we should admit it does not reach the profound heights of, say, Victor Hugo or Fyodor Dostoevsky. This is of course not a bad thing; as C. S. Lewis wisely said, the only people who have a problem with escapism are jailers. Or, as I have long said, it may be escapism, but it's damn good escapism. Doyle's Holmes stories may be thegreatest literary escapism ever, and the film is a fairly close equivalent; it may be the popcorn movie of the year.    Non-Holmes fans have even less reason to hesitate. This is an intelligent film with plenty of action and more than a few laughs. One would be very hard-pressed to find something more entertaining out now or on the horizon. Bring on the popcorn!
B00027JYLC|3.0|Knowing the history of this film, I am extremely disappointed that we will never see the Tod Brownings original version before it was mutilated by the studio.  Yes, the severe editing leaves many unanswered questions and the happy ending should have involved the \\"freak\\" troupe rather than the sugary focus on main characters.  Still, it is a movie that is hard to look away from.  Some would say fascinating and others would say a train wreck but it keeps my attention either way.<br /><br />Having watched this a couple of times with others, I am impressed with the fact that many get quickly bored and seek other entertainment (that is, walk out of the room).  The movie does start out very slowly.  In addition, several of the actors speak in a tinny voice that is difficult if not impossible to understand.  You can buy the script online for around $20 bucks if you are really interested in all of the dialogue.  I prefer to save the $20 and guess.<br /><br />My favorite characters are Henry Earles and Schlitze.  If you don't love these two guys, then you simply don't posses a heart.  Henry and his sister Daisy of course went on to appear in the Wizard of Oz as munchkins.<br /><br />This is a simple morality play with a simplified script.  It is always listed as a horror show but we know better. As previously noted, it has been alleged that most of the great scenes were clipped from the movie.  Too bad.  Nevertheless, the remaining scenes are still classic and everyone should take a turn at viewing this.  Maybe it is your cup or tea or maybe not.  For the price of a fast-food meal, what's the harm?<br /><br />I hope you find this opinion helpful.<br /><br />Michael L. Gooch<br />Author of Wingtips with Spurs.
B001T30232|5.0|Originally I thought this book would appeal to car racing fans more than to me, but I was proved wrong each page I read. The story is original and fraught with insight. I could not help but reflect on the years I have spent with the fur people in my family and the many instances they were thinking \\"Enzo\\" thoughts. Having been recently widowed I found parts of the book difficult but in the end I felt uplifted and with hope renewed.
B002VKE0XA|2.0|Ok, unless you live in Siberia or something, you all know the story, a young couple Katie and Micah seem to be visited, mostly at night, by a ghost or demon in their new home and Micah takes matters into his own hands by videotaping and recording every single moment, literally. This is it in a nutshell, \\"Night 1\\", they toss and turn, a slight noise, next day Katie whines and Micah checks it out on his computer, tapes Katie in the bathroom. \\"Night 3\\", toss and turn, bedroom door moves back and forth, next day Katie whines some more about being scared, Micah gets into it, tapes her some more in the bathroom. \\"Night 6\\" toss and turning, loud thump, Katie calls a psychic and he stops by and does nothing, and so on and so forth. LOL! Sorry, that may not be exactly it but...I will admit that I did enjoy the very end, you can skip the alternate ending, but up until that point I just didn't believe any of it or the characters. It's a shame because I really was looking forward to it.<br /><br />I'd like to congratulate the marketing folks who did an amazing job with this film, creating all kinds of buzz and hype and sucking almost everyone in the world to go see this film and/or buy the DVD. I must say I am the latter and boy was I duped! I have to say maybe I'm just a \\"doubting Thomas\\" but I don't go for all the \\"ghost hunter\\" tv reality shows and the like and when I heard the premise of this I just couldn't pull myself to go to the theater and see it. In any event I kept reading, not in great detail as to spoil any expectations, review after review praising and saying how scary this was, much to my dismay.<br /><br />One reviewer said, \\" Paranormal Activity is the most raw horror film since the original Texas Chain Saw Massacre. It's very realistic and unsettling.\\" But then in the same breath goes on to say \\"The only thing I didn't like about the movie was the stupid characters\\", how can you have a movie that is both realistic and has stupid characters? You got me, I thought the characters were very unrealistic most notably, which no one seems to mention, the visiting \\"psychic\\" played by Mark Fredrichs. His dialogue was horrible and stiff and was so completely bad that it shot was credibility it had right out the window. At some points Micah was pretty unbelievable too when he is yelling out to the spirit, and the whole cliche using the Ouija Board was almost laughable. On top of all this as the story unfolds, I won't give it away, but it just became more increasingly lame, ie the story on the computer and the past. Come on, you tell me you really got into that?<br /><br />Anyway, I could really go on and on but I won't. Like I said from the start, maybe I'm too much of a \\"doubting Thomas\\" or just don't jump on the \\"bandwagon\\" like most, I don't know, I do know this was NOT the most scariest movie ever nor should it be compared to some of the great classics! And I slept like a baby that night. Oh, I almost forgot, I did get my name in the credits! LOL! I wish I hadn't now that I know how bad it was. I've also put my copy up for sale on Amazon. Anyone want to buy it? Oh, and please don't do a sequel with Katie. LOL!
0060775858|5.0|I got this book from [...] not on Amazon.  But just wanted to say it's the best book I've ever gotten for my daughter.  I heard of the great reviews of this book and when I saw it at [...] I kind of thought, it looked boring and dull because the illustrations just didnt' look appealing to me.  But i gave it a shot and got it for my 2 year old daughter.  The first time I read it to her right before her bedtime, she was fascinated by the illustrations and sat on my lap.  She hardly would sit for a book.  But she would for this book and she even followed me and repeated what I read in the book.  Many words like, mittens and kittens, house and mouse rhymed so it was easy for her to copy.  She even woke up in the morning and asked me to read \\"goodnight moon\\".  For some reason, she loved the dull illustrations and black and white illustrations.  I guess they're simple for my daughter to understand and relate to.
1400063515|3.0|While the topic and its implications are important and interesting, sometimes I had a feeling that the author is overdoing it with adding \\"sauce\\" to the main facts and arguments in order to increase the length of the book. About 1/3 of volume would still have all important content, yet would be much more reader friendly. Do not take me wrong, I have no problem with long books, but for the genre of this book, more to the point writing is IMHO appropriate. My ranking is an average of 5 stars for topic and arguments and 2 stars for writing. Also, it may be a part of my cultural background, but the author was self promoting himself a bit too much.

One day the older brother said he had a new record. \\"I want to hold your hand\\" by some group called the Beatles. BAM! While we still youngsters we knew we were hearing a fun band. After the killing of President Kennedy we were more than ready for something fun. Now....George is gone but his music is still with us. Some day, like today, people are seeing that George is fantastic in his own right. Most of his Beatle songs were on message and had a thought to convey. Enjoy this wonderful record of Harrison Songs.
0452295548|4.0|This is a short book and it's also easy to read.  Being quite the hypochondriac, I liked it because Jill Bolte Taylor portrays strokes as nothing to be afraid of.  In fact, for her it was a lifechanging, almost spiritual experience.<br /><br />Essentially the book is in three parts.  The first part is a simple explanation of how the brain functions and what happens when you have a stroke.  I have no great scientific knowledge but I found this quite easy to follow.  The second part (most of the book) is about Jill Bolte Taylor's personal experience of having a stroke (specifically, a haemorrhagic stroke in her left cerebral cortex) and going through the recovery process. Her account of the stroke is fascinating because she is able to describe very specifically what was happening to her brain as well as how she felt and how it affected her as it was happening.<br /><br />This section also has a lot of information about how you can best communicate with and help someone who's had a stroke to recover.  There are lots of tips on basic things that you can do, for example: speak quietly but slowly and clearly, don't hurry them, don't overwhelm them with stimulation (no TV or radio), keep visitations brief.<br /><br /> One thing that I found very interesting in terms of her recovery process was how long it took: after four years of work her brain became capable of multi-tasking, after six years she could climb two steps at a time etc.<br /><br />In the final part of the book, Dr Taylor takes what she learned from her experience and explains how she believes that better understanding of the ways that our brains operate can allow us to choose what thoughts we will give attention to and to consciously override the negative aspects of left brain thinking.  This section of the book is quite closely aligned to ACT (acceptance and commitment therapy).  While I found this section interesting, I also felt it was repetitive and drawn out.  When she started talking about how she thanks her bladder everytime she passes urine I felt like shouting \\"enough!\\"<br /><br />Nevertheless a truly fascinating book.passes urine I felt like shouting \\"enough!\\"    Nevertheless a truly fascinating book.
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|Started off really great, and had a very entertaining pace.  I thought it was a good read.  A bit disappointing at the end.  The author kept leading the reader to believe there was some huge mystery to be solved, and kept dangling the carrot.  But the carrot ended up being somewhat unsatisfying, which is why I gave it 4 stars.
B002DKGWSE|2.0|Spoilers abound, so please stop reading if you haven't seen this remake or the original. I bought this DVD for $2.99 at a Blockbuster that was closing, and made a point of watching the original immediately afterward, since I hadn't seen it in about 5 years.    This is a remake to one of the most notorious horror films of the `70s. Notorious because of the various prints that floated around (some showed more than others), notorious because of the sexual degradation and violence in an R rated movie (originally meant to be an adult film, they decided to go with an R rating to make more money on the drive-in circuit). And notorious for its frequent tonal shifts - black comedy/sadistic violence/slapstick comedy/sexual humiliation.    This remake takes the safe route, and all but sanitizes the sexual humiliation scenes and the brutality of the murders. Yes, what remains will shock to a degree, but not to the degree of the original.    Here are some changes (mostly politically correct crap that has overtaken contemporary horror films):    '72: Krug's son lures the girls to the lair so Krug and company can \\"have some fun\\", and in perhaps the most disturbing scene in the film, Krug's son briefly retaliates by pointing the gun at him, but Krug has so much control over him (by hooking him on heroin), he tells him to kill himself, and he obliges.     '09: Krug's son is a stereotypic pothead/victim who innocently invites the girls back to smoke, thinking Krug won't come back until later, and actively helps out the family towards the end.     '72: the girls are typical teenagers of the time who smoke.    '09: Mari's friend smokes, Mari evidently does not (coughing when she takes a hit), and this relegates the film to the current morality tale of pot smoking=death; see \\"Chainsaw\\" `03 when Biel expresses disgust over their trip to get pot, then flicks a joint out of the window when offered one, and \\"Friday the 13th\\" `09 that has pothead dolts getting killed by Jason.    '72: Mari is shot, manages to crawl out of the lake, and is found dead. Realistic and devastating.    '09: Mari is shot, and manages to swim, then crawl out of the lake and to the house in a rainstorm that is described as so bad, even a tow truck won't come out - politically correct nonsense to the extreme. And I'm sorry, but foreshadowing this by showing her holding her breath under water at the beginning doesn't cut it.    `72: The killers are depicted as \\"animal-like\\" (Sadie), killers of a priest and two nuns (Krug), and sadistic child molestors (Weasel).    '09: Sadie has a mascara tear fall from her eye when Mari is shot, and Weasel is neutered by being renamed \\"Francis\\" and cries like a baby when his broken nose is fixed. Contrast his crybaby behavior with Mari's stoic silence when her father stabs her in the back twice to treat her. And Krug is just another typical killer/rapist that could have been in any crime-themed TV show or movie.    '72: The family is sympathetic in their revenge for their dead daughter.    `09: The family is initially sympathetic in their revenge for their *still living* daughter, but sympathy turns to incredulity during the final scene that shows the father becoming Dr. Butcher M.D. when he kills Krug in a set piece taken directly from an obscure slasher film called \\"Evil Laugh\\". This scene could have worked if it was a nightmare scene (like the chisel nightmare from \\"Last House\\" '72) but it does not work in the context of a real scenario, but instead lowers it to the level of a stupid `80s slasher film, like one called \\"Evil Laugh\\".    A technically well-made/well-acted film, but not a good remake.
B002JM1VJG|3.0|I like alot of these videos, but you know what a fun game to play while watching this is. From the beginning of disc one to the end of disc two, every time Madonna spreads her legs take a shot of vodka or any other hard alcohol. I promise you will be sloshed before the end of Lucky Star (Video 2). Or if you like, put in the second disc and start it with Music and every time Madonna makes out with someone that looks like they could be about half her age, take a shot. You'll be a full fledged alcoholic by the end of the set.
B000641D2Y|5.0|I hadn't seen this movie in years, but it's still hilarious. [[ASIN:B000641D2Y Home Alone 2: Lost in New York]] is one of those classic comedies that will manage to make you laugh despite yourself.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|LET THE RIGHT ONE IN is my favorite vampire movie. It has replaced some heavy-hitters in LET'S SCARE JESSICA TO DEATH, THE HUNGER, NEAR DARK, and HABIT! I must say that I was very impressed w/ the innocent, yet terrifying atmosphere of LTROI. The kids, Oskar and Eli, are perfectly cast and utterly believable. The story has a depth and charm that transcends the genre, making it one of the most emotionally-fulfilling vamp-tales ever made. Don't get me wrong, I love the blood-letting and supernatural exploits too. I simply wasn't expecting to be hit so hard on an emotional level! I actually cared about these characters, wanting for their success. I rooted for them, hoping for the destruction of their enemies. Not since HEAVENLY CREATURES has a movie left such a horribly satisfying mark! Scenes like the Rubick's Cube, the morse code, the hospital visit, and the swimming pool (to name but a few) are scratched deep into my brain, moving effortlessly between touching acts of love and incredible acts of brutality. A flat-out masterpiece...

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I too, like many on here, have owned multiple formats of The Beatles over the years. From records to tape to the original 1987 CD's to 2009 Stereo/Mono Remastered CD's, there is no comparison to the FLAC 24 BIT files on this. The sound is so clear and crisp that you can hear everything! It is like listening to the tracks live from the studio. This was well worth the extra $230 I paid while stick in stock here at Amazon.    Also, wanted to pass on what I did to use the FLAC files. I downloaded MAX for my MAC, which is free, and configured it to output to AIFF 24 Bit files. From there I simply dragged them into iTunes to listen. This whole process was very simple to do. Now these AIFF 24 BIT files will NOT play on my iPod Classic (5G) but they do play on my iPhone 3GS and did come over as 24 BIT files.    If you are looking for The Beatles Remastered Set or even if you already have them, this USB with the FLAC files will not disappoint you!
B002MW50KO|1.0|After listening to two songs on Christmas morning (one would have been plenty, but I wanted to make sure it wasn't a mistake), I packed it back into the CD case. A few days later I took it to the used bookstore to sell. They were laughing, knowing how horrible it was. They did give me $1.00 for it, though.
B001E45XT4|3.0|The first thing I noticed, right out of the box was the size, and the, uhm, remarkable looks of these bad boys.  Really, these phones fell out of the ugly tree and hit every branch on the way down.  Don't get me wrong--I like a full-size can.  I've worn my share of David Clark H10-13x headphones on the job, so it's not like I'm afraid big ugly cans.  This set, though, made my gourd look twice as big as it is.  Freakishly big headphones.  Lighter weight and more comfortable than your oldschool aviation cans.  No active noise cancellation, I don't believe, contrary to other reviews.  Whatever noise is being cancelled is no doubt due to the giant foam earmuff that's surrounding your ear and half of your head.      Who cares, though, if it's good for listening.  If only it were good for listening.  These headphones, I had intended to use for music occasionally (backup to my primary), and for skype (as primary).  While they'll do the trick for skype, music is out of the question.  No bass sensitivity to speak of, just a burnt-out rumble like cheap car speakers, and the midrange is awful tinny.  So don't get your hopes up for music.  I guess if you like to hear a lot of thumping sounds when you're gaming, these are good to go.  Me, I'm not a big gamer.  Probably I should have gotten an old trusty Koss set instead.      pros--Light weight for the size, microphone seems ok for skype, comfy enough  cons--Ginormous geeky looking clunkers with little value added for all the ugly they threw in. Yikes.     3 stars because they do function, but dang, you could do so much better.

This season reminded me alot like scrubs style which is a great show and i officly think that after this season and the fourth and fifth that i ve seen that it can become in the ranks of sienfeld friends cheers A.D 30 rock the office scrubs and i'm pretty sure the big bang theory modern family and glee will be with it soon and the honey moon videos or great and some great episodes or the third whell slaps giving there hilarious
B0026P3G12|1.0|Susan Boyle's lovely, electrifying voice is simply overwhelmed by a technically shoddy job of recording.  The orchestral background interferes in every single track.  You hear Ms. Boyle singing BEHIND the orchestra--far behind.  What a shame.  I would NOT recommend buying this album, though her voice even so handicapped brings you to tears.    Are you listening Simon Cowell?  Go back to square one and do this right.    January 8, 2010  WHOA, WHOA, WHOA! Stop the presses, etc. etc.      Turns out I was listening to the CD on my computer WITHOUT MY HEARING AIDS. Dumb old fogy. In the car, with hearing aids firmly in place, the CD came to life: magnificent!!  Apologies to all, including Simon.  Buy this CD.  It is a treasure.
B002EEP3NO|5.0|I bought this for my 8 year old for Christmas - and it was the best Christmas ever!  My son loves Lego Star Wars and spends hours and hours entertaining himself with the various sets.  He had  been dreaming about this Lego set ever since it was presented in the catalog - which he studies regularly.      This is the ULTIMATE Lego Star Wars entertainment weapon of mass satisfaction.  Building it took 3 days and occupied every flat surface in our living room / dining room.  The best part was that the instructions are set up so that the different rooms / levels are completed one at a time.  So we'd build for a while, play for a while, continue building etc.  The prison block is very cleverly done.  Everyone in the family participated so it was a wonderful shared experience.    Yeah, it's wicked expensive, but I figured it is a once in a life time experience, and this lego set exceeded all expectations.  The instructions are very clear and easy to follow.  Though at a certain point, you have to stop building and sort the pieces by color / type or you will lose your mind trying to find all the pieces.    One small complaint - we couldn't find about 8 - 10 pieces.  Perhaps 4 were because we used the wrong pieces at the wrong time (based on pieces left over).  But there were a few missing pieces which we had to scrounge from our Lego inventory on hand.  But all the critical / unique pieces were all there, and anyone taking on this project should have a certain amount of Lego experience prior to making the attempt.
045122499X|5.0|How long I have waited.  If you loved \\"Pillars of the Earth\\", you have probably  been waiting for this book.  All Ken's books are good, and I await each one, but this is his legacy. The time, place, and characters will live on in your mind. If you love deep historical fiction, you'll be glad he wrote this sequel.  Now I wish he could write another \\"Eye of the Needle and \\"Key to Rebecca\\" What a great novelist!
0385504225|5.0|I don't know what was true. I don't know what was real. But Dan Brown certainly made every aspect of this novel jump off the page with lifelike authenticity. And that's all that matters.    I'm not a symbologist or an historian or a student of a particular religious faith. I'm just a guy who likes to spend a few hours every now and then sitting on his couch reading a good book. Documentary makers and people who write books about books will scrutinize and analyze the facts, pseudo-facts, and myths in The Lost Symbol for years to come. But I think if you simply accept that this novel is what it is--a piece of an extremely imaginative and diligent writer's fantasy--then you'll agree with me: this is one very good book.    The Lost Symbol is a smart, exciting, and fast-paced novel that I found incredibly hard to put down. Besides dealing with Freemasonry and ancient codes, it also discusses the relationships between science and faith, humanity and the divine. This book is not a simple thriller--it's also a book that will leave you with a different perspective on reality...or at the very least Washington D.C.!
B002VECLVE|5.0|Now and then a film comes along that is so perfect as examined from every angle that restores faith in the art of motion pictures.  Such is the case with A SINGLE MAN.  Starting with the beautiful novel of a gay British professor's planned last day of life in Southern California by Christopher Isherwood, adapted for the screen by Tom Ford with dignity and the power to open up the subtleties of Isherwood's book without treading on the solemnity of the books message, directed by that same newcomer Tom Ford with conviction and identification with Isherwood's characters, and then acted with consummate skill by Colin Firth as single man George who is surrounded with an excellent supporting cast - this film is in a class by itself and hopefully those who decide on the awards for best film/best acting will honor it.<br /><br />George (Colin Firth) begins what appears to be a rather ordinary day for a teacher of English in a close by college, the voice over by Firth relates the routine of rising and facing another day of loneliness he has been experiencing since the accidental death of his young lover Jim (Matthew Goode), yet  there is something unique about this day: George is preparing for his last day on earth as he sets out his funeral attire and his gun and other accoutrements that suggest he is seriously going to end his life.  He busies himself with getting to class, leaving money for his housekeeper Alva (Paulette Lamori),  facing students who seem to be uninvolved with life in general and his course on Aldous Huxley in particular, then clearing his office and progressing with his exit plan.  Little things happen: he observes his neighbors, the Strunks (wife/mother Ginnifer Goodwin, grumpy husband/father Teddy Sears, the annoying yet perceptive little girl Ryan Simpkins and brothers Paul Butler and Aaron Sanders) as they 'play at ordinary normal life'; he talks with his longtime friend Charley (Julianne Moore), an ex 'lover' who shares his life secrets and invites him to yet another evening of food and drink and thwarted seduction; he is followed by one of his students Kenny (Nicholas Hoult) who despite the age difference offers a sense of caring and need for closeness; and he encounters a young handsome Spaniard Carlos (Jon Kortajarena) whom he befriends but decides not to pick up as a physical diversion.  Little incidents remind him of his longterm relationship with his beloved Jim and these reminders are magically captured in flashbacks in tonal colors that create a sense of aging scrapbook pages.  How George's planned 'suicide day' ends gathers all of the beauty of this film in some moments as finely tuned as we are likely to ever see on celluloid.<br /><br />Colin Firth IS George and the subtleties of his characterization are almost unbearably beautiful to watch.  His home feels like Isherwood's home in Santa Monica: there are even drawings by Don Bachardy, Isherwood's lover, sensitively placed in the set. Julianne Moore gives another brilliant performance as the distraught alcoholic aging friend of George, and Nicholas Hoult and Matthew Goode give us characters to admire and to love.  For this viewer this is as perfect a film as is possible to make.  Highly recommended on every level.

B002VH6V9O|4.0|THE YOUNG VICTORIA is a elegantly costumed and reproduced bit of history that benefits from some fine settings, solid direction by Jean-Marc Vall&eacute;e of stalwart Julian Fellowes' version of the youthful lass who was to become England's longest reigning monarch - Victoria. Much of the early portion of the film, that part when Victoria is a child whose ascent to the throne is contested by her mother (Miranda Richardson) and Sir John Conroy (Mark Strong) seems to drag and get lost in the multiple costumes and scenery variations. But once Victoria (Emily Blunt) comes of age and is courted by Prince Albert (Rupert Friend) the film blooms. Blunt is a strong actress and finds that delicate line between girlish infatuation and royal dignity that makes her a fine foil for those at court who would seek to control the 'child queen' - including her secretary Lord Melbourne (Paul Bettany). But as she matures into her role as queen her eye dwells on the dashing German Prince Albert, and a love affair that has lasted in the memories of everyone is matched by the concept of joining Royalty with concern for the care of her subjects - much due to the sensitivity of Albert. The film takes us to the birth of their first of nine children and then ends with some statements about the influence of Queen Victoria and Prince Albert's effect on the various Royalties throughout Europe! It makes for an evening of beautiful costume drama and allows us to appreciate the growth of two young stars in Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. A solid if not transporting epic. Grady Harp, January 10

All I have to say is that this series is AWESOME!!!!!
B000001EUP|5.0|If you're a fan of hard rock or classic metal this is a must have album. The performances on this album are perfect for what they were doing. To me this is the most aggressive Scorpions album and even though they had bigger radio hits later I think this was their high point.
B000002I53|5.0|Coltrane was a pretty rare musician - a guy who in the span of his career innovated and managed to achieve commercial success, often at the same time.  This album is a great example - as you can see from many other reviews, a lot of fans consider this to be an extremely accessible, and yet at the same time, it was a pretty pivotal recording in the evolution of jazz.    First, the hit 14-minute interpretation of \\"My Favorite Things\\" was a major milestone in the incorporation of modal improvisation into jazz music.  Coltrane and his former employer Miles Davis were most responsible for offering modal jazz as an alternative to the chord-based improv of bebop (and Coltrane's classic album Giant Steps).  But \\"Milestones\\" and \\"So What\\" are still tied to bebop in terms of structure - there are only a few chords, but they repeat at predetermined times.  \\"My Favorite Things\\" took modal jazz one step further - each chord goes on as long as the soloist wants.  This allowed Coltrane to stretch \\"My Favorite Things\\" or contract it, depending on what his group felt like doing.  He'd keep playing this tune in concert right up until his death in 1967.    Second, this was (almost) most fans' first encounter with Coltrane's classic quartet featuring pianist McCoy Tyner and drummer Elvin Jones.  McCoy had played with Trane since the summer and Elvin had joined just a month or so before this album was recorded, so some fans caught them in concert; and the Coltrane album released right before this one, Coltrane Jazz, included one track with this lineup.  Still, this album clearly showed that Coltrane had put a great lineup together.  (Only one piece is missing - bassist Jimmy Garrison - who would join at the end of 1961.)  Though the group's sound was still at its early stages, it's amazing how much of it is already in place - \\"My Favorite Things\\" sets the stage for later classics like \\"Ole\\", \\"Out of This World\\", \\"Afro Blue\\" and A Love Supreme.    Third, this was the first released example of Coltrane playing the soprano saxophone (you can see him playing it on the album cover).  He'd already recorded with it a few months earlier on The Avant-Garde, an album not released until 1966, but most fans had not heard him playing it.  The eastern-sounding instrument was apparently very popular because many of his contemporaries soon began playing it as well.  Besides \\"My Favorite Things\\", this album contains an unusual example of Coltrane playing a ballad on the soprano - the lovely \\"Every Time We Say Goodbye\\".    I guess I should wrap up this long review - but two more comments.  The first two tunes tend to overshadow the second half of the album because they aren't as innovative, but \\"Summertime\\" is an absolutely must-listen monster performance.  Second, this album was recorded at sessions which also generated the albums Coltrane Plays the Blues and Coltrane's Sound.  Those two albums are just as essential as this one - if you like My Favorite Things, pick them up ASAP.
B001OQCV24|3.0|Great movie but I was highly disappointed by who was \\"saved\\" in this film. As someone who has been working on a masters in theology I would just like to say that the Bible on more than one occasion says that the world will not be destroyed by water the next time but with fire. Christ also says that \\"the first will be last and the last will be first\\" in the new world which Bob Dylan quotes him in his song \\"The Times they are a changing.\\"  One other interesting tidbit of information is that it took the earth as a global civilization from about 6,000 years ago until the year 1900 to gather a certain amount of information. Then from 1900 to 1950 we doubled that amount of information. Then from 1950 to 1970 it doubled again. 1970 to 1980 it doubled again. As of 1994 NASA was seven years behind in just getting the information in their computers so they could use it. NASA predicted that by the year 2012 the information would be doubling every second! Clearly something amazing is about too happen...
1439138311|2.0|This is a simple and gentle story about a young woman's immigration to New York from Ireland in the years after WWII.  Much of the novel contains her personal thoughts and her analyzing her future and decisions and life in general.  It has an easy pace with lots of descriptive elements and a vast array of characters.<br /><br />I really wanted to love this book, but it just seemed oversimplified.  I think virtually anyone could have thought up the plot if they were given the basic elements (girl alone in big city, first real job, meeting new people, family crisis).  In fact, at one point it felt like an After School Special.<br /><br />While Toibin depicts the female brain very well in some areas, there are other things that don't ring true.  For example, other than her work and classes, the main character seems to have no curiousity about the world in general, or about the exciting new country she has come to.  In subjects such as racism and the Holocaust, not only does she know nothing but she has no interest in learning more.  And while we hear much of her thoughts, some subjects she doesn't even visit mentally:  when her female boss makes a sexual pass at her, she feels uncomfortable but never ponders it again.  Yet she ponders so much more trivial stuff all the time throughout the book (what to wear or where to eat)<br />.<br />Additionally, while there are some tragic events, overall there doesn't seem to be enough conflict to make the story interesting.  All the other characters are almost too good to be true, some crusty or cranky but all of them (excepting Miss Kelly) are big hearted and generous.  Money is never really an issue, and things go amazingly smooth for such a huge life change.  Again, that seems incredibly unrealistic.  And the strange behavior of her fiance's moodiness, her mother's unpleasantness, and her landlady's suspicions are never really explored.<br /><br />I intend to read more of his work (I have ordered the Blackwater Lightship) and I hope things become a bit more complex and realistic.I hope things become a bit more complex and realistic.

B002H3F7F6|2.0|I've been of \\"fan\\" of Sting's since my teens, listening to the classic The Police albums (such as Synchronicity, Ghost In The Machine), watching all the live performances he's been a part of, and listening to all the solo discs again and again over the years (Ten Summoner's Tales, The Soul Cages are two of my all time favorite records, no matter what genre). I've always appreciated his wide sense of musicality, his openness to various genres and his ability to combine various styles of music in his songs. Even his \\"poppiest\\" pop songs have depth to them.     I've even liked the albums that were sort of critically panned (at least in the U.K.), such as the 2001 live record \\"All This Time...\\". That said - I haven't been ENTIRELY about convinced about his latest effort in (it appears) trying to edge slightly towards being a classical singer and a performer - something he's most definitely NOT. \\"Songs From The Labyrinth\\" was the first official Sting release I DIDN'T enjoy.     First off - I have to say as a disclaimer, that I'm well aware that he intended to do a \\"Winter album\\" instead of a \\"Christmas album\\", something which has apparently confused a lot of people, including critics at [...] and The Guardian, it seems. In the documentary accompanying the Durham Cathedral concert he says producer Robert Sadin first offered him regular Christmas fair such as Silent Night, but he refused to do them - which was the right choice, it's a sign of artistic integrity.    On \\"If On A Winter's Night...\\" there are some very enjoyable highlights, but there are a lot of major let downs. It's also plagued with uneven material (for this project, that is).    In my opinion, Soul Cake, The Snow It Melts The Soonest, Christmas At Sea, Burning Babe, and, to an extent, The Hurdy Gurdy Man are the highlights. Great arrangements, the musicians (and vocalists) give inspired and thoroughly enjoyable performances. But that's only 5 songs out of 15...which means there's a lot that's wrong. Peoplehave been grieving for Sting's vocals on this one - and I have to say, I concur. His raspy, husky, very unique voice suits a lot of things - but this album is one it doesn't. In some songs, he tries to find depths his voice simply doesn't have, and the end result is borderline comedic.     Even the new versions of older, rarer Sting songs (Lullaby To An Anxious Child, Hounds Of Winter, Gabriel's Song) were much, much superior in their original configurations.
0375703764|2.0|I really wanted to like this and had been waiting for a chance to read it for months, but in the end I was hugely disappointed.     There were some great ideas present but the book was so bogged down with extraneous junk and show-offy allusions that it just killed it for me. The writing was very poor, the characterization and development was non-existent, and I dreaded every time I had to read an extended entry from Johnny Truant.    It tried so hard to be smart but any student of literature or art history would recognize all of the references from survey classes. Every \\"obscure\\" or \\"historical\\" text referenced are from undergrad lit. classes -- even down to the shaky use of the Uncanny and Derridian semiotics. The academic essay part of it was so poorly assembled and ill-conceived that all authenticity was stripped away.    To me it was shame that such a strong concept could fall apart so easily in a desperate attempt attempt to impress people by mimicking Pynchon, Nabokov, DFW etc.    The good thing is, it's a super quick read because a good chunk of it is just a few words per page. I'd love to re-read the story after some serious editing and revision, because to me (a lit. student) this was about 400 pages too long. If it was just the story of the house, and the Navidson's experiences in it, I think the author would have something great on his hands.    Very disappointing.
0061885452|5.0|I started this book with little knowledge of what I had begun. I am a fan of Ferguson's show and watch it almost every night. The truth and vulnerability that he displays in this book is astounding and truly breathtaking. It is not without humor and incredible wit that he divulges his past while, as he put it, sparing no embarrassment to himself. It's a breath of fresh air from the indulgent, sob-stories that are so often passed as autobiographies. Instead, he has created a brilliant, humorous, and inspiring reflection of a fully lived and diverse life. It is because of people like Ferguson that there is reason to be proud to be an American.
B002XMGGK6|5.0|For the first time in my life I went to the movie theaters twice to see a movie. I thought this was an amazing movie, with action, suspense and raw emotion. It's a movie that makes you feel for all characters involved, but moreso for the \\"bad guy.\\" This is definitely a flick that has audiences hoping the \\"bad guy\\" gets away with it.

0156012197|3.0|What I find remarkable about \\"The Little Prince\\" is the discrepancy between how it is generally perceived (or remembered) and much of what it actually says. It is generally treated as a straightforward (if symbolic) plea to the reader to value the open mind of a child and the bonds that unite lovers and friends. But if the book arrives at that point, it does so in a paradoxical way, like a Zen koan. The book actually highlights the dogmatism of children and the irrationality of lovers, and suggests that children should distrust adults, to whom they are superior. As a child, this message disturbed me, but I did not have the mental framework to reject it.    In the famous opening sequence, the adult narrator describes, as a child, drawing a boa constrictor that has swallowed an elephant, an image that adults invariably perceive as a hat. While the idea is whimsical and inventive, Saint-Exupéry takes the idea in a small-minded direction. Rather than marvelling at the fact that the figure can be seen in two radically different ways, the narrator pouts that adults must be stupid not to see what he drew in the first place, retains that dogmatism even as a \\"grownup,\\" and is rewarded when he finally meets a kindred soul in the little prince, who can see what the image \\"really\\" is.    This pitting of wise children against ignorant adults reaches its nadir when the prince, in the midst of his tour through the planets, meets the drunkard who drinks to forget that he drinks. \\"Grownups are very strange,\\" concludes the supercilious prince. \\"Oh, please,\\" says this grown-up reviewer, who has seen plenty of childish irrationality. Basically, the adult drinker is analogous to every child who has ever been too tired to go to sleep, namely every boy and girl ever born. I am reminded of C.S. Lewis, writing at roughly the same time, who inserted the same heavy-handed \\"I'm on your side, children\\" sentiment into his books, where \\"grownups\\" become the easy target of scorn. In one such instance, a man becomes infatuated with the statuesque witch who follows his nephew to London, oblivious to the havoc she wreaks, observing that she is a damn fine woman and imagining that her feelings are mutual. Yet even though Lewis pokes fun at the foolish adult, he is even-handed enough to reflect that children have their own ways of being silly. This insight is beyond Saint-Exupéry.    Parallel to his battle between the generations, Saint-Exupéry stokes the war between the sexes. The little prince loves a pretty little femme fatale rose who embodies almost every negative stereotypical feminine attribute imaginable: she is demanding, vain, and dishonest. Yet the prince is made to feel guilty for having left her behind; a male is to serve such a lover unquestioningly, even unto death, and thereby prove his worth. I don't mean to enter the realm of unimaginative political correctness to insist that every relationship, even a 1940s romance between a flower and a prince, be presented as egalitarian and healthy in every way. But this one seems enough to turn a reader off romance for life.    In lovely poetic symbolism, with charming childlike drawings, Saint-Exupéry idealizes what seems to be a double pattern of paternalism: grownups are to admire the children who are encouraged to scorn them, and lovers are to care selflessly for the domineering objects of their affection. I believe that adults can recover a worthwhile message from this view of the world because they are experienced enough to see it as an exaggeration, not the full picture. But it's rather a heavy load for a child.
B00002E224|4.0|this movie takes you around europe with 2 young people who start to have feelings for eachother after spending the day together. Lots of good conversation and keeps you interested enough till the end.
B001SAHOBO|4.0|3.5 Stars     I liked it ...it was entertaining with good fight scenes and a decent story. Not sure how much of it was completely true and how much was movie enhanced history, but it was a fine feature. Not as much wire work as some of the newer flicks, but there certainly was some, but not overdone to me. I would recommend it for fans of the genre. To me, it looked like the Wing Chun art was shown pretty true to form and execution(to the non-expert, but fan eye). Donny Yen did a good job as the lead.
B00005JCA9|4.0|the best Julia Roberts movie ever! The love story is great and very different one that hasn't been told and the soundtrack is even better! i own both!
B002BU0DPE|2.0|Turtle Beach...What can I say, they have yet to learn from some of their past mistakes. This is my second headset from Turtle Beach (1st Ear Force AXT for Xbox/Xbox 360). The hissing is annoying but does get drowned out by in game sound. However, if there is a quiet section it's back! As true with past sets the mic works but echo and lag plague the p21's as well...not fun hearing what you say after you just said it again. Sound, my previous set has better sound and direction...constantly turning the wrong direction and getting shot in the back with the p21's.  Another thing is a loud speaker crack with my first shot and then the chat boost kicks in, causing the volume level to adjust down. This is bothersome, in that you are constantly adjusting the game volume or turning the mic off to keep the volume constant. But turning the mic off defeats the purpose of having in game chat.   There are some positives. One is the p21's are lite and the other is the cord is very long. Other then that, this set falls short and is over priced. The Ear Force AXT's cost me $49.99 these $79.99. I expect much more then a longer cord and less weight. I have already posted them on Craigslist and Ebay after 3 day's of use. If you are looking for a better headset Astro or Tritton...If you go with Tritton get the more exspensive set cause the cheaper ones are just that, cheap. Astro A40's are much more exspensive but are the best ones I have found for both the Xbox 360 and PS3. I know that the two other sets cost more but you get what you pay for...go collect some cans, mow somemore lawns or donate blood to make up the higher price.
6305428042|5.0|This has to be one of my favorite halloween movies ever made! Great for kids and family alike! The soundtrack isn't bad either!
B003102JDM|3.0|the main character is academically smart but has NO street smarts !!!  -  he is   the full manifestation of the term a \\" WIMP\\" !  definitely entertaining but I could hardly resist the advice  to  the main character to \\" grow a pair \\" !  He is the type of individual who would benefit from a vacation in  the SouthWEST,  He could attend a NATIVE AMERICAN peyote meeting - this  would help cleanse all the FALSE TO FACT ideas he has about LIFE, living life  and his personal self worth and identity - He is hugely BLOCKED from living  life as an  independent VITAL organism !    Worth seeing if you grew up back EAST in the 50s in the middle class .
B00005JCAA|5.0|This movie is one of my favorite Brad Pitt movies ever made! this is a remake of a classic movie with a modern touch, it is kinda of long but well worth it believe me! The story that is told will answer a lot of questions people have of death and why it happens the way it does. i love this movie!
B000P6YNSE|5.0|Lost Season Three is weird, but then again the whole series is weird by design, so what's not to like?  With Jack, Sawyer, and Kate (the Lost love-triangle) all in cages held by the Others at the beginning of the season, the series makes a bit of a tedious beginning.  But as usual, things pick up and Season Three does not disappoint.<br /><br />One of the weird things about Lost (there are many) is that there are 40+ survivors, but we really only get to know a handful.  Once in a while some of the outliers show up in some scene or other, and when one lovely woman outlier says something disagreeable to Sawyer, he pretty much speaks for us all with the line: \\"who the hell are you?\\"  My thoughts exactly, and we never do find out.  Hilarious.<br /><br />One thing about this series: it is not afraid to kill off major characters.  Season Three is noteworthy in this regards.  No spoilers here.<br /><br />I liked Season Three just fine.  The Dharma Initiative continues to creep everyone out, the smoke monster is as mysterious as ever.  Elizabeth Mitchell makes her debut in this season as Juliet Burke, and she is as lovely as ever.  Mitchell is a charismatic actress, beautiful, well-spoken, with a presence that causes her to dominate every scene she is in.  Since she is a doctor, will she interrupt Jack's interest in Kate?  Inquiring minds want to know.  Again, no spoilers here.<br /><br />Another great season.  Highly recommended.  RJB.
B00005J6UP|5.0|this movies takes me back to my childhood and why i loved the eighties so much! Great for any age and any household!
B0018CWEYY|5.0|Lost Season Four is shorter than the first three seasons due to the Writer's Strike, but it packs a lot of developments into its truncated season.  The show is notable for its dazzlingly effective use of flashbacks.  In Season Four it begins using flash-forwards to give us some notion as to if and how some of the survivors get off of the Island.  Consistent with Season Three, Jack is having more than his share of issues and problems which do seem to derive back to his failed marriage, but maybe not.  This part of the storyline seems wrong to me; Jack mostly has it together and that is who he is.  But not here.  This is not really a spoiler because this is obvious very early on in Season Four and even parts of Season Three.  I also would have liked to have seen more development of Elizabeth Mitchell's Dr. Juliet Burke character.  Good chemistry between her and Jack could have been used more, and more effectively.  These are just opinions and they are fun to write about but no matter.  This is a great season of a great miniseries.<br /><br />Let's face it.  If you made it to Season Four you do not care what I or any other reviewer thinks about the season.  You are hooked, like I am.  Enjoy!  RJB.

B000UJ48VI|1.0|Let me start by saying that I am not a professional movie crictic or writer, this may not be as \\"piquantly\\" written as some reviews on here, but I am an avid reader of literature, and relatively bright.  I've read Nabakov's book Lolita, as well as seen the 1997 version of Lolita and the 1962 version. I think I've gotten the full view and scope of things, so to speak. I must, with heavy heart, tell you honestly, that this movie was a huge let down.  The charaters were very one dimensional and almost cookie cutter. There was a complete lack of any of the emotional turmoil Humbert suffered, as in the book. This movie felt like it was made JUST to be made. Not heartfelt. Lacked insight into any of the characters. Poor chemistry. Certain scenes from the book were either changed completely, or the most annoying, was they were followed thru up to a point, THEN changed. Very frustrating. There was NO sexual relations between Humbert and Lo. Ok, I understand that it was taboo back then and some stuff had to be sensored. But nothing sexual happened. At ALL! Thats what the book was aBOUT. A pre-teen girl having sex with a much older man. It was only even HINTED at very few times.  Why did he bother making this kind of movie if the entire thing had to be sensored? All subtle nuances of love, of first touchings, of Humbert's past were absent. Even an explanation of WHY Humbert was like this in the first place was missing!    Lo, in the novel was a plain girl. A girl attractive enough, but definately able to be overlooked. Its important to remember this, for nymphets arent necessarily pretty, but possess a certain aire and charm about them. Sue Lyon was beautiful and much older looking than 12 but possessed nothing nymphet or innocent at all. Much OLDER acting than 12. The whole atmosphere was thrown off by this. High heels?  Um, not for Lo! But they were worn here.    \\"Lolita\\". Another thing... Lolita was a pet name given to Lo by Humbert. Only by him, but no, in this version, EVERYONE was calling her \\"Lolita\\". Even her MOTHER! (I wonder what lurid info mamma had).  The mad Quilty was at most a silly nusance here. Not the menacing, forboding quiet giant of the novel. Just laughable. Why she even would be attracted to him in the first place from this version, I'm utterly perplexed.  I must say, watch the 1997 version staring Jeremy Irons. It was lush and warm,beautiful and atmospheric, full of subtlties and true character insight. Dominique Swain captured the true essence of a nymphet. Charming, bratty, innocent, but not at all innocent, in sneakers sucking a jawbreaker.I almost cried at the end of that movie there was so much emotion. You actually feel BAD for him that he cant be with his step-daughter. Sick, yes, but it follows the novel expertly. I'm sorry I was so hard on this movie, but Kubrik was hard on the book. I give it a D+.

B002VKE1K2|3.0|A warning first: If you intend to watch this film unspoiled, hopefully, you have not seen the trailer; nor should you. My Paranormal Activity experience was ruined because(and I am not exaggerating) 90% of the scares were in the trailer. Basically, if you have seen the trailer, you've seen the film.     Is it spooky? A tad. Is it original: Not really. Is it overhyped? Yep.    If you scare easily, you may enjoy this (or not, depending on if you don't like to BE scared). Most people go to see films like this to get an adrenaline rush. Again, if you have seen the trailer, the fun is pretty much ruined. Even the big 'climactic' ending is spoiled (shown in the trailer) so you expect it.     I applaud the film for doing so well on a ridiculously unheard of budget. It certainly is better than most other so-called horror films out there now. It feels more realistic, especially with the two main characters doing a pretty good job of acting genuinely scared. However, there are parts in the film that felt set up and unauthentic. For example, if your girlfriend was screaming her head off in another part of the house, would you take the time to grab your video camera first, or would you just go running after her? It's just little moments like that which sort of spoiled some of the excitement for me.    Also, the original ending is WAY better than the theatrical one. It feels more realistic, while the theatrical ending feels, well, Hollywoodized (not a word, but well, I think everyone knows what I mean...)
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This movie was such a let-down when we saw it in the theater this past year. Talk about being completely over-hyped and underwhelming. While the special effects were great and the sound was fantastic, both of which you would expect from WETA and Jackson, the film itself was just far too bland to be enjoyable.    Problems we had with it:  - The main character was a dud. Nothing was exciting about this guy. He was just a nerd whose life was ultra boring and we found the over focus on this aspect of the story to go on seemingly forever.  - The aliens, while looking very interesting, were anticlimactic. I suppose it is the scenario that they are put in for the movie but I found them to be very uninteresting. Too little focus on their origin, technology, etc.  - Very off-balanced mix of action and storytelling.  - Too much time in the movie where nothing significant happens - i.e. just too much 'filler' content that isn't significant.    Flashy graphics and special effects and Jackson's name just aren't enough anymore to make a movie a hit. While we love his past work, he needs to do better than this to impress us.
0061020710|4.0|This is only my 2nd discworld book under my belt, the 1st being Small Gods which comes much later in the series. This is important because so many people started in different points in the series and this obviously affects the reviews concerning this novel.    I felt like this was a strong start to the series, although not as good as Small Gods. I kept getting the sense that there was a lack of control; the story was all over the place, the characters lacked consistency, and the humor was bare. Of course, all of those are comparing it to my previous experience with Terry Pratchett's writing, meaning this: the novel is an enjoyable read on most standards! I can see where many of the motifs for the series are slowly being built and how the principal foundation is being laid.    Reading other reviews, I get the same kind of sense after reading this novel: Pratchett hasn't hit the stride yet he finds a few books in. I hope to find that this is true when I continue to read the series. But, if the rest of the novels are at least on the level of The Color of Magic, I'll be more than satisfied.
0385333846|5.0|Not enough praise can be heaped upon this book.  Its sentences are lean, mean, fighting machines.  Its characters are humanely represented, sorrowfully represented, and humorously represented.  Vonnegut's imagination fuses with memory here, as elsewhere in the body of his work, but it is in this novel that he's forged something utterly perfect in its emotional range and his ability to move through various times and places, past, present, and even future, with the literal blink of an eye.
B000V86OKG|5.0|I love Dexter!  Not like Lila, but as an altergo to my soul.  He does what we all would like to do.  Admit it, we all have a bit of the dark vigilante in us and Dexter personifies that dark force better than any other series.<br /><br />I came into Dexter midway through the fourth season, and I have now watched the first two and am anticipating the arrival of the third and the release of the fourth.<br /><br />At first, I was completely upset when I started watching season 1.  The soundtrack didn't synch to the lips, and it was beyond irritating.  Then, I changed the audio preference to Dolby 5.1, and everything was fine!  I've never run into this before, so now I know to look for the adjustment, and I had to do it for each disc...duh!  Maybe I'm a pot-hole?<br /><br />This series belongs in the library of everyone who loves the darkest of humor and appreciates true creativity!  At this point, next to Deadwood, this may be my favorite series of all time!<br /><br />Let the blood talk to you! ;o)
0061766089|3.0|I really wanted to like this book but, frankly, it was so difficult to follow and build any enthusiasm for the ideas in it, that I found myself wading through it.  Some things were so obvious - Build a Buzz (do CEOs actually set out to create boring products?).  I kept wondering when the great insights would appear.  Wouldn't you think a design guy could write a more inspiring book?  And, just a personal pet peeve, where's the index?

B0008KLVG4|5.0|Steven Spielberg, we know him from various movies like E.T.: The Extra Terrestrial, Jurassic Park, Indiana Jones series, War of the Worlds, etc. There is another timeless classic that launched him into stardom released in 1975, Jaws. It takes place on a fictitious resort known as Amity Island and begins when a college woman went swimming on the beach one evening and was attacked by a shark. The next day, the Chief of Police, Martin Brody (Roy Scheider), investigates the shark attack with the help of his wife Ellen (Lorraine Gary). Martin tries to close the beaches, but Mayor Larry Vaughn (Murray Hamilton) overrules it to make a profit on the 4th of July without fear of a shark attack. After the shark attacks a kid, his mother places a $3,000 bounty on the shark, starting a shark hunting frenzy and gets the attention of shark hunter Quint (Robert Shaw), who offers his services at a meeting. Martin hires ichthyologist Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) to do an autopsy on the shark's first victim and determines this. By the 4th of July, beaches were full of tourists. When a shark joke creates a false alarm and distracts the city officials, the real thing arrives, kills a man, and nearly takes the life of Martin and Ellen's oldest son Michael. Martin, Quint, and Hooper team up to kill it at all costs. They get to the shark on the \\"Orca\\" and lured it with chum. They shot tracers on the shark. After the engine gets damaged, Hooper gets in a cage to tranquilize it, but breaks the cage. The shark jumps on the boat and kills Quint. Martin tosses an air tank in the sharks mouth. He gets on a pole and shoots at the shark and causes it to explode. Hooper catches up to Martin and they paddle back home. I saw it with a friend some time ago and it was timeless. It has a little blood and gore, but not much. It mostly relies on suspense by not showing the shark much until the climax. The acting was splendid, the shark looks pretty real, and the score by orchestra legend John Williams is so powerful, almost on par with Star Wars. If you are a fan of Spielberg, Williams, and sharks, I would check it out. You will be pleased. This is another example of a film that didn't need a sequel, but I will get to them eventually.

0385523904|4.0|Although I do not normally care for journalistic books, this one could not have been written any other way.  Author Demick recounts the stories of six North Koreans who ultimately defected to South Korea with uncommon insight and she expertly weaves what is known about North Korea into her narrative to provide the necessary context.         First to dispel the criticism bound to come due to all of the author's subjects being defectors: even if these subjects are not completely representative of the North Korean people, there is no other way of obtaining information on the lives of ordinary North Koreans since the North Korean Government prohibits contact with them.  Even allowing for some distortion (which is not readily apparent) and dividing the individual hardships by half, the portrait of North Korea that emerges still makes Cambodia under Pol Pot look like paradise (with a little exaggeration.)         Outside of the image of life in North Korea that the author so competently paints, one must consider that North Korea is a model of how pervasive propaganda over a long period of time can cause a people to believe black is white.  We have seen this before, but rarely is it so graphically demonstrated.  The problem here is that the North Korean people have no \\"Voice of America\\" reaching them -- they are totally isolated and dependent on their government to tell them what is what.  They cannot see that South Korea is now an economic powerhouse with a high standard of living.  In comparison, in North Korea necessities like electric power have become luxuries.  To have hope is for the people of North Korea to believe what the government says.  Only through supporting the government and communism can life get better, or so they are told.         One should contrast this to the pervasive propaganda in American schools since World War II that progressivism/socialism is superior to capitalism and big government is a necessity.  In spite of this very serious effort over 60 years that has affected three generations, a majority of Americans still reject this philosophy.  Why?  Because the American people have alternate sources of information, notably their families, churches and non-government controlled information outlets.  Only in Ivy League universities where the propaganda is carried to an extreme is progressivism considered moderate -- for the average American it is still considered left-wing.  In North Korea, communism is the gold standard and capitalism and Americans are evil because there is no other thought allowed.         One would hope that the North Korean regime would collapse at some point, but its continued survival stumps and astounds the experts.  Meanwhile the people die of starvation and lose cognitive capability through malnutrition.  Unfortunately, there seems to be nothing the outside world can do to help as long as the North Korean government maintains such a tight hold on its people.         Yes, sports fans, there is true evil in this world, and it is not the United States Government.  Read and weep for the people in this book.  Our lives could become like theirs when our government becomes all-powerful.         Recommended to all.
B002Q4TKZY|5.0|I sold my regular DVD before my Blu-ray arrived, and was thinking I'd be out of luck   for everything but the movie.    On a Panasonic DMP-BD30, that is the case. You have to skip over the trailers,  as all you see is Black. When it goes to the menu, you can click on the bonus  features, but again all you see is Black. I would of been OK with this,  as I really like the movie, and was looking forward to HD.    What a surprise, in my LG BD390 ... Trailers, Bonus Features, and the movie ALL play!  (No modifications were done to my player.)    Hopefully the price will come down ... this is a little steep.  But the 3rd party sellers are more reasonable.    ...and by the way, it looks phenomenal. Excellent transfer. Single subtitles are below  the picture in the black, and doubles are in the picture & below. Very easy to read.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|To anyone who has been debating shelling out the money for this box set, I say go for it!  I held out for a few months since the release but when I saw the price on Amazon ($175) compared to in stores at nearly $250 I knew I had to seize the opportunity.  This is one of the most beautiful looking box sets there is.<br /><br />I know as a consumer I was wondering if the CD's within the stereo box sets were the exact same as the ones you can get separately in the store, and the answer is yes.  They have the same packaging and liner notes, just now you get them altogether in one package PLUS a DVD that contains all of the enhanced portions of each CD and makes it a lot easier to watch in one sitting.<br /><br />As far as the sound quality, I think they sound superb.  I was not around in the 60's to experience these albums they way they should have been heard, but I feel as though this is pretty close.<br /><br />I would also like to eventually pick up the Mono set, maybe Amazon will lower the price one day :)
1594488916|4.0|Readers understand the mystique of books. Most of us have our own quirks and book obsessions, many of which revolve around our love affair with the written word. Often we, too, have book collections of one kind or another; a favored author, a special subject, a particular format. Yet Allison Hoover Bartlett's account of one man's bibliomania makes us stop short and rethink how we react to our treasured books!<br /><br />With a definite flavor of other books on manias, particularly Susan Orleans best-selling title, The Orchid Thief: A True Story of Beauty and Obsession, we are swept up in the story telling; in awe, and perhaps dismay that there really are people who will go to prison for a book. John Charles Gilkey was, and is, such a man. This book is his tale, a look at how one man bamboozled the antiquarian book trade and its members.<br /><br />Since we have a man in a black hat, there must be a white hat somewhere--and there is. Ken Sanders, a self-proclaimed \\"bibliodick,\\" has made it his mission to stop Gilkey in his tracks, and prevent the further loss of such timeless books as a first edition of The Grapes of Wrath. Allison Hoover Bartlett's first meeting with Sanders is laden with stories of such thefts, of missing incunabula, and the \\"aesthetic charms\\" of printed materials. From the very first chapter Hoover makes it her mission to discover what drives thieves such as Gilkey, and what motivates such unofficial detectives such as Sanders.<br /><br />As far as investments go, Sanders makes it clear that few make money collecting books and related ephemera. It is a field that attracts book lovers to collect and sell treasured tomes, simply for the joy of handling rarities, smelling the must and dust of books hundreds of years old, and of opening a book for the first time, and realizing that it is in mint condition, with no foxing or tears or spine damage. Unfortunately, this attraction isn't reserved for legitimate buyers and sellers only. There is no predicting who will be bitten by the book bug, and when characters like Gilkey come out of the woodwork, it becomes--seller beware!<br /><br />As the story unfurls, the characters and idiosyncrasies of each man become more obvious. The reader is alternately appalled and fascinated by Gilkey's constant justification of his behavior and his numerous thefts, and Sanders' personal fixation with preventing any more inroads by Gilkey on illegally obtaining precious, irreplaceable volumes . Sometimes Gilkey comes off as being levelheaded and sane, whilst Sanders seems hysterical and irrational. The lines blur and waver between the two protagonists, and we almost come to understand both viewpoints, despite knowing that Gilkey is wrong, and Sanders is right.<br /><br />So often, Gilkey is portrayed as feeling distanced from his behavior and misdeeds, citing insurance coverage as justification for depriving others of their property. Bartlett says, \\"Once Gilkey had rid himself of the (item) he felt he should also be rid of all blame.\\" This twisting in the wind is typical of many lawbreakers, who feel some off-the-wall validation within themselves for often-heinous wrongs. Bartlett tries to pin Gilkey down, but despite often expressing an antagonism towards dealers, he manages to slip out of any open confession of guilt.<br /><br />Sanders' place in the story is important, for, as Bartlett says, \\"...stocking his store is a form of vicarious collecting...\\" No matter which side of the law the central characters fall on, ultimately, their instincts are much the same--to have and to hold works of immeasurable importance, both in literary value and publication matchlessness. Moreover, whether or not we share those self-same obsessions, we can understand the driven personality and the want-to-have syndrome Gilkey displays. Bartlett does a good job of helping us see the shades of grey in the stories each man tells, and not only the value of the books stolen, but the value of the interaction between thief and seller. It is an ongoing tale--woven in our culture and our value system, so that no matter how we shake our heads at the excessive behaviors, we are intrigued, fascinated, and ultimately drawn into this storyteller's art.<br /><br />by Laura Strathman Hulka<br />for Story Circle Book Reviews<br />reviewing books by, for, and about womenwoven in our culture and our value system, so that no matter how we shake our heads at the excessive behaviors, we are intrigued, fascinated, and ultimately drawn into this storyteller's art.    by Laura Strathman Hulka  for Story Circle Book Reviews  reviewing books by, for, and about women
B0001NBMEE|3.0|This 1954 movie has some good moments. The action sequences are exciting and well choreographed. The cinematography is excellent. The production values are first rate. There doesn't seem to be any obvious corner cutting. The plot is not outstanding but adequate.<br /><br />The big problem is with the script. This film has a great cast but only James Mason seems capable of doing anything with his lines - but being the villain he had a huge advantage. The characters are woefully undeveloped. This is particularly striking if one compares the film to its comic strip origins. I'm not one to complain about a film taking liberties with its sources but what purpose is served by transforming Aleta from a complex and capable, but stunningly feminine woman to a one dimensional damsel in distress? A minor but not horribly distracting problem is that Robert Wagner and Janet Leigh were a little old for their parts.<br /><br />Physically it seems that very little restoration was done with this film and there were places that could have used it. Extras are few. A Movietone news short, a theatrical trailer, and some promos for other Fox DVDs.<br /><br />All in all, worth the price of the DVD but bound to disappoint Prince Valiant fans. Non fans might be more forgiving.
0312370849|3.0|In short, the novel worked for me. It is very well-written.  How can I tell that this novel is well-written? Not once did I put it down and say to myself, \\"Gee-whiz, I wish this author took a rudimentary English and/or literature class in college.\\"      In general, the novel tugged at my heart, gave me a good amount of food for thought about how easy it is for people to turn the other way to suffering, and taught me something.  What else could I ask for when I plop down a few bucks for a novel nowadays?    While the novel over-illustrates the angst of the main character, Julia, as she hits a mid-life crisis and obsesses over her fact-finding mission, it does introduce a compelling reason for her obsession: the complicity of France in the persecution of the Jews during WWII. The author writes with intensity about the Holocaust's atrocity, the affect the Holocaust has had upon other characters in the book, and the havoc Julia's obsession causes in her life.  This intensity compels the reader to continue through page after page of unnecessary overwrought character depiction to the point of written diarrhea.      In short, the author redeems her verbose writing by a great plot. It was a page turner that I read in about a day.    I was especially moved by the author's vast research on the French complicity in the Holocaust.  I did a little research on the subject and the facts appeared to be fairly accurate. With this type of fiction, I appreciate when an author depicts events such as these accurately since without truth, we, as a society, tend to blur the truth of what really happened.    I give it between 3 and 4 stars.

B002NXPTDK|1.0|Outside of \\"Day n Nite\\" and \\"Hyerr\\" there is nothing remotely listenable on this record. If this is the \\"new\\" direction of hip-hop then here's where i'll be taking my dirty backpack to the laundry. Cudi is not even a rapper. At best he's talking to you stream of conscious style tone. He should probably be commended for going into deep areas that are reserved for artists such as Tori Amos. The problem is that nothing fits musically. It's like Kanye said \\"dude just express yourself and screw production.\\" I'd be suprised if you hear anything else from this record as none of it is 20% as good as the 2 songs I named earlier. I'm sorry but the lonely loser motif is almost anti-hip-hop. As for Kanye... I totally get why he he's tuned into a guy like Cudi. Right now he can relate. Kanye has had a life changing 12 months. From his Mom to his break-up to that bizarre auto-tuned 808 CD to Taylor Swift. If you caught the VH'1 Storytellers you can see he's a guy running on fumes. I hope...I repeat...I hope Man on the Moon and 808 are an anomaly. Hip-Hop has at it's roots always done 3 things. 1 - painted a vivid picture of urban/street youth. 2 - provided a good fun despite the circumstances 3 - makes you move even when it moves you. If you want deep go check Biggie, 2Pac, Scarface or early Jay-Z. For me? Kid doesn't quite cut it. He's sold about 3 million to this point. I wonder if his winner motif makes the music any better.
B001AVCFK6|2.0|I really wanted to like this movie but I was disappointed. What finally got to me was all of the unlikly and unbelivable coincidences which result in J.T. Kirk being at the helm of the Enterprise.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|As a recent convert to the Beatles, and one with limited funds, hearing of the new 2009 stereo remasters was intriguing to say the least. Being a CD-phile, I wanted to get both sets of remasters, but could not afford to, so I did the sensible thing and got the stereo box. To say the least, I loved it. Nice crisp sound, clean mixes (sound wise) and, except in a few cases, little tape hiss or pops and clicks without damage to sound (unlike the horrible 2002 EMI remaster of DON GIOVANNI, but that's another story.) When I began reading about the mono set, I was greatly interested, as I was only familiar with the 2009 stereo versions, and had not heard the 1987 remasters, except for MMT, and was not familiar with the fact that several of the albums were only available in mono until 2009. Being cheap, I borrowed some of my friend's CDs and went to LimeWire to get some of the songs.    Were the rumors true? Did mono sound better than stereo on both a stereo system, audiophile system, and headphones?  Well to tell the truth after sampling some:     YES!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!    THE MONO VERSIONS ARE BEAUTIFUL!!!!!!!!!    And after listening to \\"Girl,\\" I was sold on mono. The quality and detail in recreating the packaging is wonderful, and WAY better than the old 1987 versions with digipacks and LP sleeves replacing the old fashioned jewel cases I always disliked. While the White Set lacks the detail of the Black Set, especially the booklets, I really don't care about the documentaries since they are superfluous, and come on a bonus DVD in the stereo box set anyway. The box set is nice and compact due to the rather thin CD cases. I also like the look of the box in general since it is nice and simple and not extravagant like ANTHOLOGY or LOVE.    The mixes themselves are near perfect. Stereo is not bad, but more detail is in the mono versions, that the stereo versions sometimes lack in. While some songs are better in either one or the other, several sound good in both, butin most cases, I find that I am biased to mono, but even if I prefer some mono mixes of songs like \\"If I Fell,\\" \\"I Feel Fine,\\" and \\"Lady Madonna,\\" both versions are fine. Only a few songs are bad either way, mostly when it comes to stereo. While on iTunes it us possible to pick and choose what songs you want on your iPod or playlist, I find that whole versions of either the mono or stereo mixes of the albums to be better than mixing and choosing individual songs, mostly because some of the albums have different overall tones in one mix compared to another.    My pick of mixes based on album:    Nothing new, but I will give my opinions on both stereo and mono. I tend to get nitpicky with certain things, but I really did not get into it here. **Astericks are ratings for the mixes out of 4, the first being mono, the second stereo.     PLEASE PLEASE ME:. MONO! 2-track recordings sound terrible in stero since you only have vocal and music, creating an unbalanced sound. The stereo mixes are excusible here since you really cannot create that great mixes other than mono since that was what they were designed for. ****, **    WITH THE BEATLES: Direct your attention to PLEASE ME for my opinion. ****, **    A HARD DAY'S NIGHT: Up to the listener, but I prefer the mono since it sounds more authentic, but the stereo is also a good listen due to the clean mixes created by the 4-track machines. I find some songs are better in one mix over another, so I'd say both are important and necessary. ***1/2, ***1/2    BEATLES FOR SALE: Same as above since both the mixes are well done. ***1/2, ***1/2    HELP!: You may hate me for this, but the \\"new\\" stereo is my favorite. This is because it sounds the cleanest, and the \\"old\\" version is too, well, old sounding, and a poor job was done in remastering it in my opinion. I also find Ringo sounds more alive in the new one, like the mono mixes, but still located in only one channel. That said, mono is wonderful, and Lennon's vocals on the title track are different, yet good, and the mix is still clear and wonderful. ***1/2, *** (65), **** (87)    RUBBER SOUL: Listen to \\"Girl\\" in all three versions and the result in obvious: Mono. The old and new versions are possibly the only really horrible stereo versions of all the albums, both having an artificial sound, especially the new version which just recreates the original mixes. Probably proof that new remixes might not be a bad idea, especially if you listen to YELLOW SUBMARINE SONGTRACK. ****, ** (65 & 87)    REVOLVER: Wow! Mono sounds great here! The tone of the album is better suited for it, and the nice balance given to the mixes are perfect. That said, stereo is not bad, but not perfect either, with \\"Here, There, And Everywhere\\" and \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" showing off both the pros and the cons of stereo. The previous is absolutely alive in stereo, the latter faltering in a few respect. On the whole mono is better. ****, **1/2    SGT. PEPPER'S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND: MONO, MONO, MONO, MONO, MONO!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Stereo is too muddy, especially the opening tracks, and Geoff, remember to check the varispeed control next time for \\"She's Leaving Home.\\" \\"Lucy\\" is fine in stereo, but when you hear mono, you'll forget all about it. A few sections sound okay in stereo, but I avoid it since even the bandmates, Sir George, Geoff Emerick, and most critics agree that the mono version is better. ****, **    MAGICAL MYSTERY TOUR: Your choice. Give me stereo, but mono has its merits, and \\"I am the Walrus\\" sounds cleaner without the duophonic remix. Also the definetive better in mono songs are \\"Flying\\" and \\"Blue Jay Way\\" which no one really likes them anyway from all that I've heard.  It should actually be noted that this along with some PAST MASTERS songs and even older albums that the stereo mixse were created for 1971 rereleases, notably the HEY JUDE album and the mono and duophonic versions were the original versions available. I credit this as the reason for the great stereo mixes since the band had no real input and the mixes were straight forward and not as experimental or out there as SGT. PEPPER had been. Both are therefore required. ***1/2, ***1/2    THE BEATLES (WHITE ALBUM): Stereo. Mono has some nice differences, but otherwise seems like a stereo fold-down, 1 and 9 being literal fold downs (seriously, who would go through the trouble to create a mono version of 9). It doesn't sound bad, it's just that the stereo sounds more balanced and controlled compared to older releases, and some great effects are used exquisitely. A few songs sound nice in mono due to their differences, but once you go stereo for this, you cannot go back. Also, \\"Helter Skelter\\" will make youl scream louder than Ringo after you hear the mono version. ***, ****    From here on out all the albums are in stereo, so I will not discuss them here, but rather include them in my stereo review.    MONO MASTERS: First off, \\"Hey Jude,\\" \\"Revolution,\\" \\"Get Back,\\" \\"Don't Let Me Down,\\" and \\"Across the Universe\\" should only exist in stereo. That said, mono for practically everyone else. As with MMT, all songs before \\"Get Back\\" were remixed in 1970-1, or never released in stereo until 2009, so while the mixes sound fine for the most part, mono is what these songs were written for. More so than the other albums, it is possible to pick and choose what mono and stereo songs you want, but with the exception of the above listed, the stereo only tracks, and possibly \\"Lady Madonna,\\" all tracks are better in mono. Note: the YSM songs sound great, and I am glad they included them here. Just had to say that. ****, ***1/2    For the most part, I consider this to be my guideline for listening to Beatles music, and though I divulge into one version or another, mono is truly great for the band, and comparing the mixes allows for greater understanding for the complexity of their music and style. I am certainly glad I got this boxset, and since the price has dropped $40 since I got it, it is an even better buy now. Anyone who is even a passive Beatles fan needs these albums, and those who complained about the first four albms only being in mono for 22 years can understand Sir George's rational behind that.

Once she took the reigns in the studio, she never looked back. The love songs are pure and honest. Anita Baker stood out because, she has an influence of Jazz.  This foundation makes Anita stand out from any other pop singer, that I knew of, at the time this album emerged.  She was and always will be in a class by herself.

0385341008|4.0|The Guernsey Lit. was a lovely, little gem of a book. I particularly enjoyed it because of the writing style. The hand-written letters challenges the human connection beyond what we know of it today--thank you Facebook. This isn't dominantly a \\"girl-loves-guy\\" novel. There were over 20 characters mentioned in the book, but each was individually crafted and unique in their tone, vocabulary and anecdote. I'll also say that I loved how the plot was crafted around the main character's, Julie, journalistic intuition. She focused on a small culture of those who found hope, bondage and intellect in a historically horrific time. You don't have to be a 'lover of books' to enjoy Guernsey. It's a really easy read, I conquered it in one sitting. It's a little sad and suspenseful at times, but mostly inspiring and humorous.
B00005JMYI|4.0|It took me awhile to see this movie. Will Ferrell is someone I can take in doses. Usually I have to be in a certain mood to see one of his movies. I kept hearing how Anchorman was such a great film and wondered what the hype was about. Well, the hype is well deserved.<br /><br />What we get is the fictional story of Ron Burgundy. Swinging newscaster of the 1970's. He dominates the airwaves and has a way with the ladies. However, all this is about to change as the news station is hiring its first female anchor.<br /><br />There are many great quotable lines in this movie. The humor may seem pure slapstick on the surface, but there are some clever lines going on in this movie. I have to point out that the news anchor gang fight is worth the price of admission.<br /><br />The supporting cast did an excellent job. Special recognition should go to Steve Carrell for playing Brick (a not so bright character who only seems to know what is going on with the weather), David Koechner for playing Champ (sports anchor with his own special catchphrase), Paul Rudd as Brian (like Ron, also a ladies man and seems to act as Ron's right hand man). Christina Applegate also deserves a big nod for playing the no nonsense reporter Veronica who is fighting for her right to anchor the news.<br /><br />There are some surprising cameos as well such as Jack Black, Vince Vaughn, Ben Stiller, Tim Robbins and Luke Wilson. They all help to round out the cast as competing news anchors, with the exception of Jack Black as a biker.<br /><br />There are also some nice special features on the dvd including Will Ferrell in full Ron Burgundy mode doing a mock interview for ESPN in 1979. There is also an interview with Bill Kurtis and Ron Burgundy done in the style of The Actor's Studio. All about Ron's life and career. Also included are may deleted scenes and out takes from the film.<br /><br />So, enjoy this movie because... When In Rome......  and<br /><br />Stay Classy Planet Earth!
0307341550|3.0|Well, I finished this book in 4 days.  This was definitely a page turner, but for me, not in a good way.  This was less of an \\"I can't stop now because I really like the story and want to get to the bottom of things\\" and more of a \\"This book is so disturbing, if I don't finish it soon, I'm just prolonging my own suffering.\\"<br /><br />First off: it was well-written enough (although Gillian Flynn has an annoying habit of using \\"said\\" way too often...surely she could've referred to a thesaurus every now and then and used other words such as asked, lamented, cried, sputtered, ventured, mused, begged, implied, etc.) and she had formulated a fairly good whodunit.  She certainly keeps you guessing regarding the identity of the real killer, even though she left enough clues from the beginning, and for that, I applaud her.  Her little switcheroo at the end was entertaining (although not entirely surprising).  She also paints both a pretty and a cynical picture of Missouri (having never been there nor known anyone from that state, I wouldn't be able to comment on the veracity of her descriptions).  Her character development was above average, paying close attention to her main players and adding some color to the supporting ones.  I do think she had a tendency to stereotype, but it wasn't distracting enough for me to dislike the book on this count.  If anything, the mystery part of her novel played very much like a TV mystery (if sometimes a tad screechy).<br /><br />Despite all that, however, the novel itself was disturbing on so many levels.  It was a complex psychological narrative dealing with cutting, inferiority complexes, psychological diseases such as Munchausen's syndrome (and Munchausen's by Proxy), and sadism and masochism.  In my mind, it would've been one thing to approach these topics as the alarming afflictions they are, to not only inform the audience of their existence and pique their curiosity, but to play on the audience's emotions in a \\"positive\\" way (there is such a thing!): confuse them, confound them, elicit distress, frustration and even anger, maybe provoke the audience to look these up in other books/on the internet but then walk away from the story and their research with a little more knowledge but remain relatively unscathed.<br /><br />But all too often, I felt that every time Flynn wrote about her characters' psychological illnesses, it was meant less to provoke and more to titillate.  Whenever she wrote about sex or cutting or even the emotional tortures her characters inflicted on themselves or onto each other, she left me feeling extremely dirty and rattled.  I'm neither delicate nor squeamish by any means, but I sometimes felt as if she gained some form of risqu&eacute; enjoyment from writing in this manner, as if she relished the act of noting down the various debasing acts she described so vividly, so viscerally.  Even her detailed meanderings regarding the pork industry made me (temporarily) steel away from bacon, ham and any pork products. Throughout some parts, I almost equated her words as a type of torture porn, only not in film form.<br /><br />As contemporary works go, I've read worse, and I've certainly read better.  Maybe this just isn't my type of novel or genre.  Still, I got through the whole thing, but I don't think I'll be journeying through another one of Flynn's novels.  I think that as a TV or movie critic, she gives very insightful critiques and I generally like her tone.  But if this novel is any indication of the sort of fiction writing she will continue to do, I think I will make a concerted effort to avoid her other works, not because they're not well-written, but because it's just not my cup of tea.ng!): confuse them, confound them, elicit distress, frustration and even anger, maybe provoke the audience to look these up in other books/on the internet but then walk away from the story and their research with a little more knowledge but remain relatively unscathed.

But the path they chose isnt bad either.<br />They show us MJ the man and how he leads the rehearals, how he takes charges and knows what he wants and also shows how considerate he was to his cast of dancers and the band, no big ego coming off from him at all, but a perfedetionist wanting to get it right for the fans.<br /><br />There was a lot of film shot and they use alot to show the progression from the start to the ending where you can just tatse the upcoming concert and how awesome it was going to be.<br /><br />maybe they will go back into the film vaults and try to capture a complete concert as it was to be, no song breaks or talking on how to fix this or that but giving us a fel of a complete concert that never was, it can be done and it will blow your minds.<br />Rest in Peace MJ

1594488916|3.0|Allison Bartlett's tale of book thief John Gilkey and amateur detective Ken Sanders is quite engrossing, especially to a bibliophile reader. Bartlett sprinkles anecdotes not only of Gilkey's escapades, but of collectors who lived in other countries. She also dangles the question of where Gilkey's ill-gotten books are stored and even the psychological reason for his behavior. The mystery of Gilkey, himself, kept me turning pages late into the night.<br /><br />  For most of those reasons, I recommend the book, at least to collectors and book lovers.<br /><br />  I had problems, however, with Ms. Bartlett's conclusions (e.g., if Gilkey's motivation to collect rare books was to show them publicly, why did he keep them hidden?) and the major loose end (where were most of Gilkey's books stored?). I had a good understanding of Gilkey's persona and M.O., but no real affinity for the person who should have been the hero of the story, Ken Sanders. Despite the pages devoted to descriptions and dialogue with Sanders, I never felt that I truly got to know the fellow.<br /><br />  In the hands of another author (or a movie director), the characters and the suspense might have had more life, while the story could have been presented more concisely.<br /><br />  Finally, in my opinion, Ms. Bartlett's footnotes were mostly unnecessary.

Aborigines trying to shoot down aircraft with arrows.  Really exciting stuff.  After an hour of predictability I decided it was a waste of time.
0452289963|5.0|Stumbled on this book quite by chance - on (of all places) a financial forum where I'm a regular in a string with members listing their favorite books. A New Earth was the only one I didn't already recognize, so I picked it up from the local library just to see what the fuss was about.    It was hard to start, but for me, it is one of the most important books I have ever read, and the most important in about 10 years at least. After 55 years on this earth, I was surprised to learn more about myself and understanding others than I imagined possible, and the learning has only begun. I am a newbie to this sort of topic so I found it a tough read, very different from the mainstream American cultural mindset, but if you're open to it, it is a most enlightening experience. I also watched the Oprah webinars with Tolle which also helped me understand it better. I have since bought my own copy, as I expect to refer to it often. A remarkable book...
B001GSTOAM|5.0|This book focuses in on small details that really come together to make a great set of core practices for designing simple, easy to read source code.  Bob Martin is a great Author, and the ideas in this book come from his and others extensive experience.  I liked how the chapters were really focused in on particular topics.  Great read.
B002W6Z0UK|5.0|After Lady Gaga's premier album 'The Fame', us Gaga fanatics have been waiting with bated breath for her next installment. Is Lady Gaga a no talent hack who values style over substance? Are the flashy costumes and makeup affectations used to distract us from her non-talent? Happily, the answer is no. After going toe-to-toe with Beyonce at the VMA's and the Grammy's in '09, Lady Gaga managed to come away with several accolades of her own and if 'The Fame: Monster' is any indication, this piano child prodigy is here to stay.<br /><br />Lady Gaga is many things, but a pseudo britney/aguilera pop amalgamation of poo she ain't. She writes, performs, and sings her own songs! Additionally, she is a wizard on the piano! Initially I despised her for using a seemingly endless amount of synthesizers and autotune for correcting vocal deficits, but after hearing/seeing her live via youtube I was given a very different perspective: she is an incredible talent who deserves our utmost respect.<br /><br />Now on to the CD. Yes, its content is edited which greatly bothers me, but otherwise it is a must have. The standout tracks for me are 'Bad Romance' (which we all know and love), 'Teeth' (reminds me of something you might hear in a live stage show on broadway), and 'Speechless' (lyrically and melodically reminiscent of Queen...me likey). What I could have done without: 'Alejandro' (too listless and repetitive for my taste). But, for the incredible deal on Amazon, 7/8 isn't bad at all and a hell of a lot better than most CD's these days. Highly recommended!
0307269981|5.0|I've read this book and his first book and they were both amazing!!  I have already ordered the third book of this saga.  It's sad to know the author didn't write any other amazing books like these.
0312570740|5.0|This was one of my favourite books of 2009. At last someone could meet Marc Rich and get more than monosyllables out of him. This book is very well researched and I congratulate the author for his tenacity in explaining to other people what oil trading is all about. Not only that, we learn that Marc Rich's ex-wife was perhaps not, as previously widely reported, the sole individual who helped gain a last-minute pardon from Bill Clinton. Some Israeli friends seemed to have helped a lot too.    I'm still not sure whether Marc Rich is a saint or a sinner. But, after reading this book, you have to admit, he's a very clever man and extremely astute when it comes to business.    As for Bill Clinton, I can imagine that last-minute pardon still seems a mystery to most people.    Marc Rich says he will never return to the United States for a visit, just in case he's arrested, for example, for a minor parking offence. Does that mean he doesn't really believe too much in that presidential pardon?    You have written a very entertaining book, Daniel Ammann.
B00006GEXQ|5.0|Bought this as a gift for my mom for christmas. Arrived very soon after I purchased and in new condition. Very satisfied with price and product itself.
B0027DK206|1.0|If this was a cheap toy, I wouldn't judge it so harshly.  But Lomography sells their Diana+ camera for about $45 then this back is about $75, so that's a $120 camera you're using.  So even though it masquerades as a cheap toy, it is not that.  And for $120, I expect to get decent prints most of the time.  I'm not talking about great or exceptional prints.  I'm talking about a print where you can identify what's in the picture.  However, as the other reviewer stated, getting a such print is a rare event.  Indoors, there's not enough light.  Outdoors in sunlight, there's too much light.  This leaves you with a rather narrow window for taking pictures, and even still, they might not turn out.  When you take into account that the Instax film is about $1 per shot, you're wasting a lot of money.  I cannot recommend that anyone buy this product.

1594488843|5.0|I read 39 books in 2009, just \\"a few\\" shy of my goal of 50. Thanks to a little nudge from some friends I've set my 2010 sights just a little bit higher: a book a week, for a total of 52. I got the list off to a good start this weekend when I finished this latest from Dan Pink. Interestingly, one of the first books I read in 2009 was also one of his, A Whole New Mind: Why Right-Brainers Will Rule the Future.    In that previous book, as the title suggests, Pink describes the type of workers that will emerge - actually are emerging - to solve the complex business and social problems now facing us. Taking that as a starting point in Drive, Pink provides some guidance on what will be necessary to \\"manage\\" these new types of worker by exploring the what motivates these workers to perform. Or, as the title put its, what drives them.    Part One of the book explores the evolution of the motivation \\"operating systems\\" at play throughout human history and how the science of motivation is leading us to version 3.0 of that Motivation OS. Or, at least, how it should be leading us to this new version. I found it fascinating that much of what Pink describes in the book is not new at all, but has been known for several decades. Known and ignored. Known and actively buried buy those who just couldn't believe it or didn't want to accept what it meant for them and their positions of control within organizations. Fascinating reading.    At the end of Part One, Pink delves into the differences between workers who are intrinsically (Type I) and extrinsically (Type X) motivated, and leads right into Part Two, which explores the three elements that make up Type I behavior: autonomy, mastery, and purpose. The chapters for each of these elements includes some insight into each, along with practical examples of what they mean.     Part Three is the \\"Type I Toolkit\\", which includes suggestions, reading lists, and other tools for individuals and organizations to help them become more Type I. As Pink says, Type I's are made, not born, and this toolkit can help you remake yourself, or your organization, as a Type I.    Perhaps the most damning statement about the current state of affairs, at least in my mind, comes in the sentence: \\"Unfortunately...the modern workplace's most notable feature may be its lack of engagement and its disregard for mastery.\\"  Longtime readers of my blogs know that mastery is a concept I've long thought and written about. Pink's chapter on mastery in the context of work pulls together many ideas that I've struggled with over the years. This chapter alone was worth the price of the book.     All the rest is an excellent bonus.

0811821846|5.0|My 5 year old son and I have really enjoyed this cookbook. I appreciate that my son's practicing his reading and culinary skills, and my son appreciates the funny names and pictures (and of course, the finished products :). The recipes are easy to follow and cater to even the pickiest of taste buds!
B000XR49VQ|3.0|This is my favorite film and has been since it was first released. I bought the VHS (also for an insane amount) and was excited that it was finally available on DVD, but this transfer is really bad. The audio overloads at times, and the video quality is poor. the video isn't even full frame 4:3. I agree with those who said that this looks like a cheap VHS->DVD transfer. To pay $70+ for it is almost an insult. Unless you are a true hardcore fan of this film, avoid this DVD.
B001KVZ6FW|4.0|I know I am late coming to the party on this one, but we just never got around to seeing this in the movie theater.  Everyone raved about it and we picked it up to watch over the holidays when we had some extra time at home.<br /><br />While I  enjoyed the movie and there were portions that were hilarious, I don't quite get the total rave reviews on this.  At times the movie moved a bit slowly and the story line didn't flow for me as I expected -- particularly the shamed explorer who is at The Falls (dont' want to give too much away).<br /><br />I still compare almost all animation to \\"Finding Nemo\\" and \\"Monsters, Inc.\\"  which I liked better. To borrow a phrase -- good but not great
B00002SWEM|5.0|It is a great movie. I bought it for my father and on Christmas day, my whole family -all the ages- ended watching it.
B001F3DY9A|5.0|Ask anybody that knows me, I'm not a country music fan.  But, after hearing some of the songs from her Fearless album on the radio and really liking them, I took the gamble and bought this album and Fearless.  Now I haven't even started listening to Fearless because I can't stop listening to this album! This girl has a real gift for putting powerful emotions into beautiful words and turning it into a catchy tune.  EVERY SONG on this album is a jewel. The music is lightly produced, which is perfect because it gives more emphasis to her singing.  But don't get me wrong, each of these tunes are extremely catchy. I never realized how good a little twang and a banjo could sound. But the real gem here is the lyrics.  She wrote/co-wrote each song.  Each of them are from real experiences in her life and it shows.  She sings of love, longing, vulnerability, heartbreak and loneliness--things that we can all identify with at some time in our life.  She's certainly not the first to sing about those feelings.  But she shows real literary and musical genius in being able to tell us these stories of her life in a way which causes us to be right there with her as she lived it and to feel it ourselves.  Furthermore, all of her songs, even the saddest ones, come from a position of confidence and optimism that remind us that it's OK to be sad when you don't get the person you want every time, when you are different and don't fit-in, and when someone has hurt you.        In summary, Taylor Swift has made me remember how good music can be.  Her debut album is like a good book that I hope never ends. This isn't pop candy.  Each song deserves to be savored, and if you are anything like me, you won't be able to stop listening and singing along to the songs on this album for a long time.
B0000C8AUO|3.0|As my title says, I'm commenting on a particular version of the album.  By now, you know how you feel about this record.  For what it's worth, I think Reality's the latest in a set of strong albums that brought the Dame back in full force.  True, he's stopped writing songs that change the face of pop culture; the Seventies was his decade as a capital-A artist, just as the Eighties constitute his creative nadir.  But starting with The Buddha of Suburbia, he's produced a set of strong albums that do him no shame (Outside, Earthling, Hours, & Heathen -- take your pick) and often remind me of what I loved about him as a songwriter and bandleader.  (By the way, what a treat to see Naveen Andrews have come into his own on Lost; check out the original Buddha of Suburbia mini-series if you want to see a great portrait of UK life in the 70s.)<br /><br />As for Reality, we may never see another new Bowie album or tour, given that he seems to have settled into a happy retirement, so if this is his swan song (as Bring Me the Head of the Disco King implies), it's a fair way to head for the exit.  It has some gems (Disco King, Loneliest Guy, Days, the title track), two great covers, and nary a bum note throughout.  It doesn't hurt that once again a few familiar names are in the band and Visconti's on board as co-producer.  But you may still be pining for the Seventies and not give this a chance, nor the other fine releases of the Nineties and the Noughties, in which case my words won't change your mind.<br /><br />That being said, I want to bring fans' attention to the copy of Reality that I acquired.  We all know about the various alternate packages, but they pretty much come down to the album plus an EP with the three songs Fly, Queen Of All The Tarts, and the Charlie's' Angels remake of Rebel Rebel (that version also pops up on the Diamond Dogs anniversary repackage, which is not really worth the money, I think -- but that's for another review.)  There are other editions with live DVDs and other bonuses, but it seems that most Reality releases offer these same cuts as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I stumbled across an Austrian version (a limited run since pirated out of Belarus, I believe) that adds the 3 EP tracks to the actual album, which makes for a much fuller listening experience.  The songs are great, they all rock, and climaxing the album with the new Rebel Rebel is -- well, a climax, in every sense.  I own the only copy I've ever seen (though a friend has that pirate edition); the disc id # on my copy is COL 512555-9-5125559000/1.  The package is basically the same, with the tracks listed as \\"bonus track\\" (no plural) under the regular listing.  Remember, it's clearly a single disc, if you go looking for it.  For my money the best way to enjoy this fine and -- could it be? -- final Bowie release.live DVDs and other bonuses, but it seems that most Reality releases offer these same cuts as the sweetener.<br /><br />However, I stumbled across an Austrian version (a limited run since pirated out of Belarus, I believe) that adds the 3 EP tracks to the actual album, which makes for a much fuller listening experience.

B000065PUE|5.0|I recently heard about the Pixies being on tour in my home town and unfortunately missed them (nov 2009).  As a substitute I watched the Pixies documentary film [[ASIN:B001U5S2WM Pixies - loudQUIETloud: A Film about The Pixies]]. It made me remember how much I loved the Pixies music and caused me to update my library with this CD. These guys are musicians par excellence.  This and Bossanova, IMHO, are their two best albums. This is when they were at their creative best. If you like other Pixies songs and don't have this, you've got to get it. Almost all other alternative rock pales in comparison.  Kurt Cobain even publicly stated that Nirvanna's biggest hit \\"smells like teen spirit\\" was a blatant knock-off of the Pixies style. Not to say that wasn't a good song...  Now, in general, you don't listen to the Pixies for insightful or clever lyrics. It's the music that matters. As one other reviewer points out, the Pixies are a band in which the sum of the parts FAR exceeds the individuals. I don't know why, as each member of the band has incredible mastery over their instrument and a unique style that is totally their own.  Any one of the band members, it seems to me, could elevate a typical band to must-hear.  Now, multiply that by four for each of Frank Black, Joey Santiago, Kim Deal, and David Lovering, and you've got the alternative rock dream team.  The Pixies, like no other band I've heard before or since, know how to build a song that is at the same time angry and beautiful.  Harmonious and melodic, yet punk angry with screaming vocals and wailing guitars and driving percussion. On this album, they are at their best in using their instruments to capture the angst, anger, frustration and energy that alternative rock represents, while also layering beautiful melodies and harmonies. The result is just...musical!  And, as if those beautiful melodies are not enough, they thwart any attempts to categorize them as a loud angry alternative rock band by interspersing a few incredibly catchy melodic feel-good pop songs.   Now, I'm not 18 anymore (thank goodness!), but I've got to say that when I'm working out hard, this album captures the gamut of my feelings perfectly.      This album should be in the library of any serious alternative rock fan.
B0017KIBAI|5.0|This is simply a GameCube Controller in white color, and a long cord too.<br /><br />if you have a wii and need a gamecube controller, no matter if is for virtual console or play gamecube games, you really need one of this, because it match perfectly the wii color, and actually looks like it was a part of it, is so nice to tune up your wii.
0439813786|5.0|I received this book as gift and was a little curious.  My aunt told me it was a whole new kind of book and that I might not like it.  She was wrong.    The book is told in words and pictures, a genius move.  Often times I find myself reading a boring paragraph in a book and really just skimming it, possibly missing something important.  Here, the pictures are used in just the right places to tell the story, with words in the right places as well.    Other than the brilliant style change, I loved the plot of this story.  With twists and turns at every page turn, it was hard to put down.  I also appreciated the various ages the story could appeal to.  Children would enjoy it for the pictures and the fun plot, but adults could enjoy it too for the several philosophical moments and the bigger lesson it teaches.    Overall, my hat's off to you Brian Selznick.  This is truly an unforgettable novel.
B0015AARJI|4.0|This is just like the standard controller that comes with the PS3. It works really well and can be used at a great distance because of bluetooth. My only complaints are that it's pricey, not entirely as ergonomic as the XBOX360 controller IMO, the L3 button was hard to push, and it didn't come with an USB cable. Sony should ship their units with 2 of these anyays. Still a good product.
B002W6Z0UK|1.0|ugh. I'm so mad that it's censored since it didn't say \\"edited version\\" anywhere. In fact, I was coming to Amazon.com just now to make sure I wasn't the one that made the mistake. I love the CD and I love all of the songs but now I'm upset to have to to purchase another CD.
B002T9H2ME|3.0|First, this movie is about story, substance and thought- not about action, aliens, effects, or set design. So one may forgive this blatant derivative of Kubrik's now 42 year-old masterpiece. Any sci-fi setting would not take away from this movie's essence. We also have a HAL figure whose design is more reminiscent of the Wall-E master computer. But if we're talking HAL, then he's been neutered and ultimately proves the Achille's heel for this movie.    The topic and premise are actually quite thought provoking and initially disorienting. I was reminded at some point to the experience of reading existential plays by Jean-Paul Satre or Camus. In fact this story could reach success rewritten for the theater and I appreciated it more as such.    The concepts of loneliness and isolation, family alienation and abandonment, discovery of the self and purpose, etc. upon which this film touches are nothing new. Worker exploitation by some evil, profit motivated but otherwise poorly defined corporate entity is all the rage these days, but reaches new heights in this movie. The worker is no different than the product; the worker IS a product; even has a shelf life \\"do not use beyond this date\\" product- pure capitalistic nirvana.    So far so good. The movie falls apart after Sam's revelation. Sure he's devastated by the news concerning his \\"wife\\" and presumed daughter, but the viewer gets no insight into any inner turmoil or philosophical reflection. We thus lose any point of view and are left with anticlimactic sketchy plans for a road trip. While we can cheer the escape and sabotage we have no real understanding.    As to the eunuch-HAL. Empathy and willing accomplice to sabotage?!!It's like playing chess on a computer and the PC lets you win out of pity.    Overall a pleasant neutral film sure to stir some debate but ultimately falling short of memorable.
B00156ZWV0|5.0|I don't usually write reviews, but I thought I'd have a go after reading some of the reviews others have written here. True, there are no lyrics, libretto, or notes in this set. Also, there is no apparent order to the works (chronological would be nice), though the producers at least seemed to try to group certain styles together, which I appreciate. Usually this lack of information bothers me because I like to know as much as possible about who and what I'm listening to. At least the booklet tells the titles of the pieces, their movements, and the performers as well as the dates they were recorded. Just that alone comprises nearly 40 pages. What you get here is good MUSIC and lots of it. I love having the alternate versions - though there are only a few.     If you are new to RVW like I was when I bought this and are interested in getting a fuller picture of his work than what just a symphonies box set or a few \\"greatest hits\\"-type CDs can offer, I can without hesitation recommend you purchase this set. It has such a broad range of styles from symphonies, to folk songs, to operas, and more. I made it half way through this box so far and have not heard a bad recording -- quality-wise or performance-wise. I am very pleased with this set and would certainly buy it again if I had to do it all over. Buy it, and you may even find yourself scouring libraries in search of RVW's biography (written by his widow) like I did to learn more about the life of this remarkable composer! This boxed set is highly recommended.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|This was THE BEST MOVIE EVER MADE!!! I was so sucked into the movie in so many ways, It was like being there with the characters...there will be no movie that even comes close to this movie.....until the sequel!!!
B002LL13AM|2.0|Save your money and get the WTK ([[ASIN:B0000041Q7 Book I]] and [[ASIN:B0000041RF II]]) by Andras Schiff. Mr. Pollini doesn't seem to have a clue about Bach's polyphony and counterpoint. Listen, for example, to how he skates over the D major and D minor preludes, or the towering 5-voice fugue in C sharp minor for that matter, and you'll know what I mean (not to mention the less than satisfactory piano sound). Maddening. Pollini's pianism is much better suited for 20th-century repertoire. Enough said.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|I'll keep it brief.  Legend of the Seeker has been one of those surprise series that has captivated both my wife and me.  The acting is superb.  The effects okay (but excellent for a TV show with limited budget).  And the storyline is interesting and holds our attention longer than most.  Bridget Regan and Craig Horner portray their characters with depth, feeling, and passion.  I typically do NOT like fantasy TV shows, and this is the best I've seen.  I highly recommend \\"LOTS\\" season one.
015206396X|4.0|Okay, this book doesn't quite deserve a four-pointer (four stars is pretty high praise for me), but I just couldn't give it three for one reason: Po, our heroine's love interest.  In my opinion, Po made the story.  Funny, compassionate, and impressively humble (more humble than I would have been in his situation, but I won't get into that), he was easy to fall in love with.  And I was truely not expecting what happened to him in the end of the novel; I have to give Cashore credit for that particular curveball. It was a bit sad, but it showed that even heroes have to suffer the consequences of things.  As for other positive aspects of Graceling, the very concept of Gracelings--humans Graced with inhuman ablities, apparent only after their eyes change to remarkable colors-- was innovative and engaging. King Leck's evildom was a nice twist, also unexpected in the beggining. For a debut novel, the writing, too, was far more intelligent than the avrage YA fiction.      Beyond that, though, I had some problems with Graceling.  It's never a fully enjoyable read when throughout the story you're wishing almost any other character was telling it besides the one telling it. I love brave, intelligent, self-suffient female leads as much as the next gal, but Kasta was unrealisticly hardcore; too invulneralbe to be relatable.  Her character comes off as if femininity were a bad thing, a weakness that connot be afforded if you're going to also be kickbutt.  She did evolve a bit as the story progressed, but not really enough to be likable by the end. And as much as I loved Po, I couldn't quite understand why he loved HER.  Their relationship went from friendship to love/sex in a blink, and then it was on to the usual business of assainating the king. It got rather tiresome hearing Kasta complain about how inconveinent and unwanted this romance was (and the sebane, or whatever it was called; the no-pregnancy herb was just a bit too much for me).      As for the adventure, it draggedin places.  Parts that should have been frought with suspense just kind of happened, no scene more so than the end shebang, which was more like the end she....that's it?  It was over too quickly and too easily, considering Leck's formidable Grace.  I was also dissapointed with Po and Kasta's resolution.  It is MORE THAN CLEAR that Cashore would rather kill all her characters off before marrying any of them, but for protagonists that are supposed to be deeply in love, Po and Kasta basically end up as friends with benefits, to give it a PG-13 phrasing. There is no sense of commitmet or devotion, only selfish convience.     All and all, I enjoyed Graceling, but I would have liked to see the series continue Kasta's and Po's story, which it does not (Fire is the companion novel, and stars a whole new cast of characters). And this book is not for the kiddies.  Even as an adult I thought it was a little much in all the wrong places.

0439023483|5.0|Amazing book! Absolutely captivating! This was one book that I could not put down. This is a story about a dystopian society which is ruled by a \\"big brother\\" of sorts. It details the journey of a young girl who is forced to go through an annual competition called the Hunger Games! Suzanne Collins is a master at catching your attention right from the beginning and leading the reader through an epic tale of adventure, love, and rebellion! 5 stars!
0316096199|5.0|After reading this book, I came to Amazon to read the reviews, and started with the one and two-stars.  It seems that a lot of people picked up this book expecting a novel.  Naturally, they got disappointed, because this is real life.  So before you start reading this memoir, please set yourself in a \\"real life\\" frame of mind.  The \\"characters\\" are not characters, they are real people.  Their train of thought is not always going to be linear.  The \\"storyline\\" is going to wave in and out.  There will be no nicely wrapped conclusions and answers.  This is, after all, the account of a rape and its aftermath, and needs to be taken at face value.  If you read this book and are disappointed at the end, please stick to fiction from now on.<br /><br />For those of you who liked it, kudos: you demonstrated great empathy and maturity.<br /><br />Alice Sebold is an extraordinary person, despite all her flaws, and a lesser being could not/would not have survived this horror to the degree that she has.
B001PO53IO|4.0|What a great twist on the star wars story line !  even better on blu-ray!
1449575617|4.0|This is an example of quality Victorian fiction, with romance, intrigue, deception, rogues, subterfuge, sprawling estates and more.  Unfortunately, it also has a nice guy (Walter, a drawing teacher/artist) falling for a supermeek yet seemingly attractive woman (Laura) who can't tell some blackguard of a suitor (Sir Percival Glyde) to shove off because she doesn't love him (so goes the Victorian era, I suppose).  That aside, Wilkie Collins has crafted a compelling yarn that revolves around these three individuals, not to mention the skullduggerous Count Fosco.  While the book is rather long, it's never dull.  You'll want to keep reading to find out what Sir Percival's \\"secret\\" is as well as how Walter will set everything straight in the end.  Good stuff.<br /><br />Note: if you're accustomed to reading and enjoying 21st-century \\"mysteries\\" by the likes of Robert Parker and James Patterson, you'll probably struggle with this due to Collins' quality English and the lack of extensive dialogue. If you just read \\"Northanger Abbey,\\" however, \\"The Woman in White\\" shouldn't require any shifting of your reading gears.<br /><br />SPOILER: I was rather hoping for some sort of physical struggle between Walter and his two enemies by the last third of the novel, but alas, that never came.  The story, though, was satisfactorily concluded, mind you.
0307716988|5.0|A touching and heartbreaking autobiography. Michael Jackson relives his difficult childhood, his feelings for his family, crushes and friends. The hard work it took to get to the top, the sacrifices and the undeniable effects of extreme loneliness are all in this book. You can't help but feel Michael's pain and wish you could make it better. His thoughts, inspirations and dreams of the future are all here. some he realized like making film inspired videos. He definitely had the acting bug, especially after making the wiz a dream that wasn't fully developed because of his music career. A quick read for all Michael Jackson fans interested in his history and mind set during that period of his life.
B002VPE1B6|4.0|Don't get me wrong. This was a very impressive endeavor in IMAX 3-D, with astounding special effects, a solid script and good acting, but it's like watching an ultra-expensive futuristic version of \\"Dances with Wolves,\\" except that the main character in \\"Avatar\\" pulls a \\"Capt. Kirk at Starfleet Academy\\" move and changes the ending so the natives win.<br /><br />Stephen Lang is awesome as the head of security in this movie and it's nice to see him get a great role. Giovanni Ribisi is also great to watch as the corporate guy focused on the bottom line. Excellent choices.<br /><br />There were, however, a few issues, such as: 1) Why is it no big deal to transport billions of tons of people and equipment to a planet with a non-breathable atmosphere, hostile wildlife and resistant humanoid life forms, but getting \\"unparalyzed\\" is a hideously expensive venture? 2) How did Sam Worthington get some of the corniest lines you've ever heard in a movie? 3) Why didn't the humans just map out their various target locations from space and use tactical nukes (or something else), thereby eliminating the need for the line-of-sight mission at the end of the movie? I almost laughed when I saw a bunch of guys trying to shove a load of explosives out the cargo bay. 4) Why is it that the avatar technology (i.e. the brain link between human and avatar) works anywhere on the planet, but guidance systems, FLIRs, etc. don't? Despite all these quibbles, Cameron and crew did a fantastic job and have raised the cinematic expectations of the movie-going public.<br /><br />8 out of 10.

0316069906|5.0|The amazing thing about this book is the fact that it's such an open discussion of the subject. It is anything but a lecture on how the author believes people should live or behave. Jonathan Safran Foer includes interviews of people on all sides of the issue to give a well-rounded view to the reader. It is a juicy, surprising, and eye-opening read. I would recommend it to anyone - carnivore, omnivore, or herbivore.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|Ordinary young couple Katie and Micah have been experiencing some interesting phenomena.  Out of a sense of playfulness--for he doesn't really believe in ghosts--Micah buys a video camera and decides to film the events.  Thus, this film.<br /><br />The technique behind PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is one that I have always found intriguing--surely the most interesting way to film a horror movie.  CLOVERFIELD utilized it effectively; QUARANTINE, not so much.  Never saw BLAIR WITCH, though I probably will if I find it for an outrageously low price.  My point is, ACTIVITY looks and feels real, which is far more than most horror movies coming out these days.  Its premise is its strongest suit: no real explanation (in fact, what little explanation there is was extraneous and weighed the film down); no real horrors actually seen, at least until the end (and oh, what a final scene; the very last image is a bit cliched, but the minute or two leading up to it...phenomenal); no overarching goals or ambitions or social commentary.  It's just a simple little horror novel about ordinary people finding themselves in an extraordinary situation.<br /><br />I have the feeling, if you didn't see it in theaters, you missed out.  I know a bunch of people who saw it at the cinema and were thoroughly disturbed; after all, a group of people gets frightened far more than a single person (fear being contagious).  Having watched it alone in my apartment (at night, at least), I was entertained, if not overly frightened.  Nor was I really disturbed, and that is why I gave the film only three stars.  The performances are strong (this doesn't come across as \\"acting,\\" and it shouldn't), the script is engaging and realistic, and the sound effects are absolutely creepy.  But the film never really lingers.  Sure, the ending is great--in fact, that may have contributed to the enthusiastic response.  PARANORMAL ACTIVITY is a ho-hum movie with a truly great premise and a fantastic ending (even the alternate ending is okay; not as good as the one used, but disturbing nonetheless).  It's worth a viewing to fans of the genre; and, over time, will surely gain a cult status that it probably deserves.as good as the one used, but disturbing nonetheless).

0618918248|5.0|I approached this book with some trepidation, even though I tend to agree with most of the author's opinions. My hesitation was because of a TV program Dawkins did on religion in the UK a couple years ago, in which I recall him being quite arrogant and condescendingly dismissive of all religion and religious people (\\"faith-heads,\\" he called them).     So I was very pleasantly surprised to find this book to be a calm, fair, rational argument for atheism. It takes all major theistic arguments seriously and addresses each of them in turn. The book covers a variety of fascinating topics, from the nature of religion (and possible reasons for its existence) to the specific evidence for evolution and against creationism. It concludes with an excellent discussion of the meaning of life without God or immortality.    The nature of the debate is eloquently set out in the first chapter, addressing common objections like \\"science is just another religion\\" and \\"only fundamentalist/extreme religion is bad\\", explaining his general refusal to publicly debate creationists, and wondering why we should be asked to \\"respect\\" religions by not criticizing or questioning them - when the same is not asked of political or other opinions. That last topic is an especially important one that I thought he handled beautifully.     The most important historical problems with Jesus' life and resurrection are highlighted. A full chapter is devoted to the morality of the Bible, using concrete examples to explain why it shouldn't be the source of anyone's ethics (and actually, that it isn't). He includes data from studies (\\"thought problems\\" posed to volunteers) that show all humans share a similar sense of what's right and wrong, regardless of religion or culture.     A highlight for me was a fascinating description of the cargo cults of Africa, which sprung up around the 1950s. They include a named messianic figure who would have been active only 60 years ago, and yet it hasn't even been possible to verify he existed! It is a striking illustration of how religions can get started so quickly on such obscure origins, even in the modern historical age.    This book is an excellent introduction to the major arguments against theism and to the major philosophical and scientific issues concerning religion. It strikes the perfect balance between technical and readable (he's one of the few scientists to manage this) and is well-organized into topical chapters - I enjoyed reading it straight through, but you can jump in anywhere.
B000MXPE7O|2.0|A great cast is wasted in this long--make that lo-o-o-o-o-o-n-g--film that purports to be a fact-based film about the origin of the CIA. Perhaps the CIA really was formed as depicted in this insufferably boring film, but having Angelina Jolie inexplicably throw herself at Matt Damon's gloomy, robotic character calls even the most basic facts into question.<br /><br />But worse than that is the amateurish script.  Each scene lasts about fifteen seconds before moving onto the next--often unrelated--scene. So we see the set up, say, of a scene, then the outcome, but not the drama in between.  If you've seen a TV movie in the last few years, you may get what I'm talking about. I've read reviews comparing the film to \\"The Godfather,\\" but I sure don't see any similarities.<br /><br />Sure the movie looks great, but clearly the director/screenwriter/editor/producer--or some other Hollywood genius involved with the film--has no understanding of dramatic structure.

1416594787|2.0|I received \\"The Greatest Show on Earth\\" for Christmas and am well into reading it.  I was initially concerned about the narrative of \\"40 percenters\\" (evolution non-believers) and the general bullying he engages in.  I find that terribly juvenile from a scientific point of view.  I am a former aerospace test engineer and have many times been forced to prove technical points in writing over the objections of affected aerospace vendors with regard to scientific anomalies and as to whether these anomalies constituted aircraft safety concerns.  One uses just the facts.  Name-calling and sarcasm are not convincing tools and are never employed in technical proofs.    I wanted to get a feel for where the author was coming from, so I Googled \\"Professor Dawkin\\" and \\"global warming.\\"  Very interesting to find a quote from him hailing Al Gore's movie \\"An Inconvenient Truth\\" as the go-to guide to global warming.  This movie is filled with scientific errors including the childish use of a Mercator Projection World Map, instead of a simple globe, to calculate warming and cooling global surface areas.     It seems as if Professor Dawkins is simply churning out book after book against religion and hyping evolution with no additional facts.      FYI, I am no religious zealot and am constantly in search of \\"proof of evolution\\" in order to promote that fact with an actual fact or two.  Looks like I must continue that search...
B001AVCFK6|5.0|J.J. Abrams's reboot of my personal favorite television/movie/book/game/comic/etc franchise is an incredible movie. Seamless transitions, above-average acting, and a riveting script combined to make this my favorite film of 2009, and my second favorite film in the ST series (second only to TWOK, because, well, Khan rules). Watching the movie in Blu-Ray format makes it even better. You can see Karl Urban's freckles and the individual beads of sweat on Capt. Robau's  head in the opening sequence. The phaser battles came through so clear, I actually caught myself wondering if my TV would get damaged (only for a split second, but still).     If you're going to own this movie (as any self-respecting Star Trek fan should), get it on Blu-Ray. Anything else would be illogical.
B00003CX8V|5.0|Good solid movie !  We've watched this at least two times a year for the last decade or so.  Not too slap stick, not too depressing.  Grim, funny, lovely, real.  Jack Lemmon at his best.  Shirley MacLaine sweet, tragic, tough, lost.  Might even be a happy ending lurking there but is it ?

0385523904|5.0|Examining what goes on in North Korea - on any level - poses monumental challenges for today's journalist.  Access is rarely given to any part of the country.  When it is, it's severely restricted to certain areas.  \\"Minders\\" make it impossible to approach \\"real\\" North Koreans, and - as Barbara Demick's book shows - many \\"real\\" North Koreans aren't even allowed in cities which are (occasionally) visited, such as the capital city of Pyongyang.      So it's a small miracle that Demick's Nothing To Envy: Ordinary Lives in North Korea was even conceived.  Although Demick made it into North Korea on multiple occasions, the vast bulk of this book comes from interviews with North Koreans who managed to make it out of the country successfully.  Many of these escapees were from the northern city of Chongjin, a city near enough to North Korea's border with China to make fleeing a slightly easier task than it would be from other points.  Without having seen it herself, Demick paints a portrait of Chongjin - the daily rhythm of life there, the changes brought over the course of a few years and the personality of its residents - that manages to feel absolutely dead-on, without sensationalism or distortion.  Demick herself admits that it's likely that she's gotten some of the details wrong, but the \\"reality\\" she creates is believable.      The book is nothing more than a series of interwoven character sketches alongside some relevant political and socio-economic context.  But the intersections of the lives and events she portrays are masterfully depicted.  Although Demick has a journalist's eye for detail and a documentarian's desire for truth, she deftly transcends what would be, in lesser hands, simple fodder for the dailies.  The book has no great arc.  Although drama drips from every page, and the current fates of the warmest characters are detailed, Nothing To Envy feels, much like the fate of the millions of North Koreans stuck in a despotic wasteland, ever-so-slightly unfinished.  This isn't criticism, rather its high praise for an author sensible enough to let time tell the rest of the story.      Most parts of the world, in most important eras, are marked by a piece of literature or documentation that superbly convey that time and place.  For understanding North Korea's people at the start of the 21st century, I can't imagine a better book than this.  Very, very highly recommended, and timely.
0307454541|4.0|Really 3.5 stars.  A very entertaining mystery novel.  I found the gore a bit excessive and often over-the-top.  There's a sense of the author trying too hard to shock his readers.  But in the end the story holds together compactly.  If I hadn't known that this was the first novel of a series, I might have had more hesitations regarding the conclusion, but as is, I'm interested to learn what else awaits this dreary world Larsson crafted.<br /><br />One issue I found interesting:  the role of the women in the novel.  The epigraphs that accompany the intro page to each part of the novel list statistics that deal with violence against women in Sweden.  This is embodied to varying degrees by several male characters in the novel.<br /><br />I wonder then did Larsson intend for the portrait of his protagonist Blomkvist's relationships with women to seem so sexist?  To a certain degree, I think yes.  Then again, it also relates not only to the actions of the protagonist but also to Larsson's own use of language as an omniscient narrator.  It's something about the narration that gave me consistent pause, the way the women of this novel all but throw themselves at Blomkvist's feet, as if in submission to some irresistible sexual Adonis.  And likewise the way his actions toward them are described.  Did Larsson produce an intentional or accidental irony?<br /><br />Regardless, this novel came in handy during my recent holiday trips.  It's slow in parts and perhaps the true denouement occurs too early in the plot to sustain the same degree of interest over the final 1/4 of the text, but it's still a finely crafted novel and well worth the attention of mystery fans in particular.
B002K0WBXW|5.0|This is an amazingly funny movie.  For a \\"chick-flick\\" it really was good.  It takes place in Sitka, Alaska.  Some people wont get some of the humor, because Alaskan based humor is quite different.  Until you have lived in Alaska and experience some of the experiences shown in this movie, you can't fully appreciate how funny it is.  Even with the Alaska humor, it is a great movie for all Non-Alaskans.  Sandra Bullock and Ryan Reynolds deliver a great performance and very funny production.

B000UR9QGW|5.0|What can i say about this movie that hasn't already been said a thousand times over?  An absolute classic, regardless of which genre you place it in.  The blu-ray picture quality is only a slight improvement over the standard DVD version, but if you don't own it already you might as well go with the blu-ray version.  this is a MUST OWN movie!
B001AVCFK6|4.0|There's been enough commentary (much of it VERY detailed) on many aspects of this product, so I'd just like to say that other Blu-ray's in this format (Blu-ray + Digital Copy) also come with a DVD version and for typically the same price.  I feel a little cheated that there was NOT a DVD version in this edition.

B001MYIXAW|5.0|Fascinating, haunting, beautiful, touching, subtle and eerie all wrapped into one. I have watched this film several times on dvd and blu-ray. The 1080p transfer is stunning. This film has pushed it's way into my Top 10 of all time list. It is that good. These young actors have a bright future ahead for themselves. Many people try to compare Twilight to this film. There is not even a comparison. \\"Let The Right One In\\" is on another level when it comes to films. This is how you make a great film; not big budget special effects, boring story and terrible acting. Folks, this is one of the best films I have ever seen; not to mention maybe the best vampire film ever made as well. I know there is a subtitle issue for some viewers. If they release an updated version on blu-ray with the theatrical subtitles, then I will buy that as well. Money well spent.

B0000E5NPZ|3.0|I don't really understand the love and adoration for this film.  It is decent at best, but it lacks any and all real definitive originality to make it a memorable or even commendable film.  Aside from Kerr, who is remarkably moving, the acting is awkward.  Niven is serviceable but nothing to write home about (he won the Oscar this year for the better of his performances) and while I adore Seberg and consider her turn in `Breathless' to be utterly stunning, here she is as amateur as they come.<br /><br />She is trying way too hard, and it shows.<br /><br />The film strikes a familiar chord with a jealous daughter who works hard to disrupt the budding relationship between her father and his new beau, a woman who seems all to comfortable playing `mother'.  Cecile is a spoiled and rather outlandish young woman who would rather drink and flirt and party than study.  Her father Raymond fancies her to the point where he overlooks all of her obvious flaws, allowing her to slip away in debauchery.  When Anne, a proper and intelligent woman, enters their lives it becomes apparent that her stay is going to be too much of a positive influence on the pair and thus something MUST be done, especially when Raymond really starts to fall in love with her.<br /><br />Alas, the obvious unfolds (even if the overly tragic ending is not one I expected).<br /><br />What I find rather shocking is that so many tote this as an underrated gem, when in my opinion it isn't like this film really earns that pedigree.  Like I mentioned, it is fine and all, but it doesn't elevate the material or present us with anything we haven't seen done many times before.  The ambiguous relationship between Cecile and her father, with someone uncomfortable to entertain, is really the most interesting piece to the puzzle, but it is never explored with any depth or real certainty.  It is left hovering over us like an unspoken rule and so we are left wondering how astute the film COULD have been had it attempted to flesh out the realities of that relationship.<br /><br />That said, Deborah Kerr is marvelously used, with the perfect pitch and tone to her performances, creating someone we can rally behind and firmly believe in.<br /><br />I see where this could have been a really stunning portrait of father/daughter bonds, but instead it becomes a school-girl fantasy of love, lies and tragedy that never adds anything new or exciting to the catalog of familiar and similar films.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and it's not `French' enough!relationship.

B0031RS4WU|3.0|Funny, clever, unique and many other positive adjectives. Undoubtedly a fantastic book but one which is not well suited to Kindle. The frames are rendered far too small, making it almost impossible to read the captions and speech bubbles. Your eyes would rather you  pick up a copy off the shelf... Or maybe from some sort of internet-based bookstore.
B001GCUNWQ|2.0|While I haven't been a partiular fan of this series, I found this to be the least engaging of the three.  The reactions of my family seem to match.  Certainly it has a few chuckles, but overall was not a favorite.  I am a big fan of other family friendly animated films, and this is just not on my list of \\"must see\\".

B002I9Z8G2|3.0|I am a Star Trek fan since the night the original series premiered on NBC.  While I did watch it, I have always felt that Star Trek-The Next Generation was a bit overrated.  I remember picking up a sci-fi magazine during the '80s or '90s (I forget which) which listed ST-TNG as the greatest sci- fi series of all time and ST-TOS at #12!!!  Thankfully this magazine is no longer in business.  As for the Star Trek movies, the critics went bananas over this film.  One actually said it was the best Star Trek film since \\"Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan.\\"  Better than \\"Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home\\" and \\"Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country?\\"I don't think so!  (This is almost as silly as a film critic in a moment of temporary insanity who proclaimed \\"Never Say Never Again\\" as the best Bond film since \\"From Russia With Love.\\")  Anyway this film got near-unanimous great reviews and still grossed less than $100 million in the U.S.  I've always felt this film to be overrated.  However I must admit to enjoying the blu-ray transfer I watched last night.  The picture and sound quality are excellent.  I just wish Paramount would stop using the same special features that are found on the deluxe dvds of these films.  As for the film itself, there are still many things I do not like about it.  I cannot stand James Cromwell's performance as Zephrame Cochran, the inventor of Warp Drive.  I find him to be an uncharismatic and unlikeable actor.  (Cochran was portrayed by Glenn Corbett is a 2nd season Star Trek-TOS episode, \\"Metamorphosis.\\"  I'm not sure if he was still alive when this film was made, however he was a much better looking and likeable actor than Cromwell.)  I'm also not a great fan of Patrick Stewart, in T-shirt, doing John McClane- like stunts at the end of this film.   I did enjoy the scenes with the Borg a bit more than previously (especially the scenes outside the Enterprise.)  I'm still not a great fan of the Borg Queen however.    I still think the best Star Trek:TNGfilm is \\"Nemesis,\\" which was surprisingly the biggest flop in the series.  And while, as stated previously, I've never been a great fan of this film, I think I can now jump it over \\"Star Trek V: The Final Frontier\\" and \\"Star Trek Generations.\\"  (I still believe \\"Star Trek Insurrection,\\" the film following this one to be the worst in the series.)  I do feel that poetic justice has taken place with the great success of the \\"Star Trek\\" film this summer, people continue talking about Kirk, Spock and McCoy and Captain Picard and the crew of Star Trek-TNG have basically been forgotten after only four films.  As stated, Star Trek-TNG was a good series.  However Star Trek: The Original Series was a classic.
0307454541|4.0|I had doubts about this book. It seemed to start slowly, or perhaps because it takes place in Sweden, in a culture so different from my own, I was reluctant to accept it.<br /><br />Nevertheless, about sixty pages in I was completely smitten. The heroine, Lisbeth Salander, is quite possibly my favorite heroine of all time. She's the reason I intend to read The Girl Who Played with Fire. I have to know what will happen to her next, and how she'll handle it.<br /><br />To sum up, it's definitely a book worth reading - if you enjoy twisted murder-mystery novels.

B002VH7P4O|5.0|I grew up with the Beatles.  I had most of their LP's, but they've been sitting in my attic for years.  My wife and I took a trip to Liverpool this past summer.  We visited all of the boys birthplaces, homes, schools, the Casbah Coffee Club, the Cavern, the Jacaranda, Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane, and on...  It was a blast and a very connecting experience.  When I got back to the states, I got the USB remasters, and all I can say is I'm in Beatles Nirvana.  The sound is amazing, the videos are fascinating and the album jackets bring back a flood of memories.  Each and every song is crystal clear and amazingly beautiful.  It sounds as if I were sitting in the Apple recording studio back in the late 60's listening to them live.  You will not regret the purchase of this set.  Worth every dime, and sure to be a collectors item one day.  Instantly downloads all of the albums into iTunes, AND instantly downloads MP3's for CD burning.  Now, I recommend a trip to Liverpool to drive it all home. Since we visited, now every time I hear Strawberry Fields, Penny Lane or Eleanor Rigby, I can see them in my mind (and photo album).  AMAZING!

0143034901|4.0|Set in Barcelona in the 1950s, after the civil war, the book starts when a man takes his ten year old son to a secret place, the Cemetery of Forgotten Books. He is told he can pick one book only, and little Daniel finds \\"The Shadow of the Wind by Julian Carax\\". Daniel reads the book in a day and is greatly intrigued by it; however when he asks his father who is a bookseller about the author, his father says he had never heard of him. His father then takes him to see an old friend of his, the book collector Barcelo. Barcelo is amazed that Daniel has a copy of the book since it seems there has been someone going around to bookshops and booksellers and burning all Julian's novels. And when a man with a singed face and a black coat finds Daniel and asks him to sell him the book, Daniel knows he has to get to the bottom of things and find who Julian Carax is/was.<br /><br />Several characters are introduced: Barcelo, his niece Clara, Daniel's friend Tomas, Fermin the homeless person Daniel finds, and more. With each chapter you realize that all these characters and minor plots feed a bigger plot and the ending is satisfying in the sense that it ties up everything. I finished half the book in one sitting, and I really wanted to read the last chapter to find out how things ended. I'm glad I didn't though! The pace was slow midway but picked up and I greatly enjoyed reading this. I will be on the lookout for more of Zafon's books.<br /><br />I accidentally bought this book twice (at the same bookstore at that, too). It took me about 8 months to start it though!

1401323820|5.0|Everyone needs to watch the show \\"Castle\\". It is 10 times better than any other show on television, especially in this new age of \\"reality tv\\". The writing is clever and witty, and the actors are extremely talented (and Nathan Fillion is yummy...). It's on Monday nights at 10 pm on ABC.<br /><br />For those silly people who don't watch this great show and may not know, Richard Castle, the title character (played by the hottie mentioned above), is a writer who shadows the detectives of the NYPD. This novel, \\"Heat Wave\\", is written by this character and is based on the female detective, Kate Beckett, who is Nikki Heat in the book. I know, a bit confusing, but if you watch the show, you'll get it...<br /><br />My point is, after all this blubbering, this is a fun book. If you're a fan of the show (and you should be...) then you will be a fan of this book. The characters are exactly the characters from the show and the dialogue kept me laughing out loud through each scene. It was pure entertainment and I finished the book in the span of three days, which is actually pretty quickly when you consider that I saw friends and family and had to be social during those three days as well.<br /><br />From a writer's perspective, I give it a low score. Mixed metaphors and amateur writing. In the show, Rick Castle is supposed to be a great and talented writer, but with this book I'm not sure he would have been published in real life...<br /><br />This will never be literature in any way, shape, or form. It is purely for fans of the show to have a piece of Castle and to pretend (yes, pretend) that he is a real man who writes real books. I love it! And, seriously. Watch the show.
B002HWRYJE|5.0|Bought the DVD for my husband for Christmas.  I was pleasantly surprised when we watched it, what a great movie!  I was a kid when the original Star Trek was a TV series, I was really happy with how the movie rolled out, really good.  I think this movie would be enjoyed by those familiar with the TV series as well as new viewers, very well done.  PG 13, we watched this with our 12 year old and felt the movie was appropriate for her as well, she really liked it too!
B0015HOFZI|3.0|I received this product in a timely fashion, The 45 spindle was missing, so what, I don't do 45's anyway. Not much to set-up. Though I was Surprised to see that the belt(a rubber band part) of the belt drive was needed to be installed upon set-up, but following the instructions to the letter made it a breeze, removed the tie wrap from the arm, and plugged in the USB, there, a walk in the park, I put the cover on it and admired it, all shiny and gleaming black. The software was also cut and dry, Since I am not into editing,the extra sound effects are over the top, maybe I'll have to experiment. I've worked with it by downloading from LP's and putting files into the Windows Media Player and If done properly WMP will label and update the file. I'm not going to say that it's all cut and dry, however I will say it can be done with memory(How'd I just do that?) and passion either for the electronics or the music. I'm sixty years old if I can, you can.
B002PMV9FG|4.0|This movie had some high and Low points, though not my most favorite of this series, Acting could of been better and they left you with a whopper of a cliff hanger, still I'd watch this again!
B002VEB228|5.0|Odds are reviews are going to spoil how fun this movie really is.  If you like thrillers, you just simply must see this movie.  'Nuff said.
B001MEJY8W|3.0|\\"It will polarize audiences!\\" scream the reviews.  \\"Brilliant!\\" say some.  \\"Grotesquely bad!\\" moan others.  It's been called shocking, relevatory, revolutionary, unsettling, profound, and even genius.<br /><br />Let's not get carried away.<br /><br />First of all, unless you yourself are a mass murderer or life-hardened torturer, this movie WILL probably bother you.  That is, without question, one of its goals.  The film excutes a little soft-shoe at the end to make you believe that goal is secondary -- to convince you that the movie (and its heroes and villains) had a higher purpose -- but I'm not sold.  Not at all.  I'll get to that.  In the meantime: be prepared for some gut-churning violence.  Lots and lots of it.  So much so that, yes, ladies and gentlemen, it is gratuitous.<br /><br />I'm going to harp on this for a bit.  I've read many, many reviews that argue that the film is in no way gratuitous, that the overwhelming amount and quality of the violence is in service of a greater point.  These people are, at best, unaware of what the word \\"gratuitous\\" means.  At worst, they are willfully and gleefully unaware of the film's point.<br /><br />IF the film's goal were simply to horrify and unsettle, then the violence is by no means gratuitous.  \\"Let's make people puke!\\" the director could've announced.  \\"Let's cause them to choke up bile into their sinuses!\\"  IF he'd said this, then the violence would've fit the film to a T.  Children being beaten and flayed.  Various implements hard bolted into bones.  Knives, shotguns and hammers.<br /><br />This is not the film's goal, however.  The first half of the film shows us a young child escaping from some kind of torture chamber and undergoing extensive recuperation, during which she befriends another girl.  Fifteen years later, the two girls set off on a quest of vengeance, which doesn't take that long, really.  Up to this point, most viewers will be excited to know what happens next, will be intrigued and (if not slightly sickened) happily disgusted.<br /><br />Then the film spirals into a philosophical black hole.  The story suddenly veers away from the (so far) compelling revenge plot and enters a world of weird and wealthy people who have sinister and stupid goals.  I wish I could go into it, but I don't want to give anything away.  I'll just say this:<br /><br />Most people struggle, at their most basic, with one question: what's the point?  People find the \\"point\\" in lots of ways, but throughout human history, the most popular explanations have had to do with the world outside of the human realm.  With that \\"sleep\\" that Hamlet was so uncertain about (\\"perchance to dream?\\").  People have used lots of things to legitimize or discredit or dis/prove the purposefulness of the human experience: drugs, war, religion, meditation, and logic.  This film is, basically, about a, shall we say, unique way of discerning the validity of the human experience.<br /><br />Does that sound pompous or self-indulgent?  That's because it is.  Especially the way this film goes about it.  Hence the gratuity.  Needless to say, this film demonstrates a rather macabre way of sussing out the existence of a Higher Purpose.  As soon as it becomes clear where the film is headed, as soon as the film reveals the bunny in its hat, the magic trick is over.  And yet this movie goes on for about fifteen more minutes, showing the same violence, the same torture, the same ridiculous excess.  It is, in effect, trying to make martyrs out of the audience's sensibilities.  Understandable, but not clever.  It's like the child who does the old \\"knock knock\\" joke that involves the following exchange dozens of times:<br /><br />Child: Knock, knock.<br />You: Who's there?<br />Child: Banana.<br />You: Banana who?<br />Child: Knock, knock.<br /><br />This goes on and on, with you checking your watch and indulging the child.  Finally, the kid says, \\"Orange.\\"  \\"Orange who?\\" you respond.  The punchline?  \\"Orange you glad I didn't say banana?\\"<br /><br />Ah, it's punny.  There's an element of wit to it.  But it's freaking annoying.  Gratuitous.  This film is that joke, but it's not funny, and although its final line has the same spirit of word play and snarkiness to it as \\"Orange you glad I didn't say banana?\\" it is nowhere near as decisive or illuminating.  Instead, this film plays off obfuscation as if it were the same thing as brilliance.  That's not bad all by its lonesome -- other films have done the same thing with far greater pinache and beauty -- but coming at the tail end of so much nauseating wickedness and hell, it's very much a cop-out.  It's as if the filmmaker couldn't conceive of any straight-forward way to justify the movie he just made, and so he aborts the whole thing with an incoherent mumble.<br /><br />Five stars for the first half.  Zero stars for the last half.  I recommend you stop the movie at about the forty minute mark.  (After the \\"monster\\" is dealt with once and for all.)  You'll have watched an artfully filmed and coherent vignette of a film.  Everything past that is worthless.ing.  Gratuitous.

B002VPE1AM|4.0|Let me say first off that I really enjoyed this movie.  The visuals are stunning and the 3 D is so well done that you really don't even notice that it is in 3 D.  I thought the technical effects and cinematography were outstanding and should recieve an academy nomnination at least and possibly even the Academy Award.  The actors all did an excellent job and seemed totally realistic which for a sci-fi movie is an achievement in itself.  All in all an excellent movie BUT and that is a very big BUT -- the screen play was trite and message ridden to the point of annoyance.  The military as usual were  portrayed as ignorant savages bent solely on mindless destruction.  The Earthlings had already raped and destroyed Mother Earth and were now on a mission to rape and destroy another planet in the name of corporate greed.  This was a transparent metaphor for how the white man raped and destroyed North America crushing the Indians who were at one with the land.  However, this propaganda ridden screen play ran up against reality because natives armed with bows and arrows cannot stand against modern weapons and technology.  So the ridiculous author of this even more ridiculous screen play had to throw in attacks by heavily armored animals who were impervious to all weapons in order to orchestrate the very obvious and necessary victory over the military and greedy corporate rapists -- the message being that Mother Nature would rebel against greed and the raping of the planet. This was a good movie which could have been so much better with even a grade C screen play.  Still this was a beautiful movie with excellent actors who were burdened with a sub-standard screen play.  With a better screen play it would have been a 5 star effort.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|The good thing about reading a first novel by an unknown author who was highly recommended by a friend is that I know I'm probably going to be in for a good read.  It's my opinion that first novels by authors who subsequently become well known tend to be better than the novels that follow. Maybe its because the first novel is when we are introduced to the main protagonists, thought goes into the shaping of their characters and the plot is woven together well.  I find that an author can often lose the plot with a character a few books down the line and really shouldn't carry on hacking away if they've run out of gripping and believable material.  Dan Brown's last Langdon novel and the last 2 seasons of CSI Miami and Las Vegas serve as prime examples of endeavours well past their sell-by dates and Patricia Cornwell should just be kind and kill off Scarpetta and give her a good Christian burial.<br /><br />OK, back to the matter at hand.  Larsson introduces us to Mikael Blomkvist and Lisbeth Salander and they are very likeable characters.  Blomkvist is the nice guy reporter next door who gets dragged into an adventure of sorts. There's not really anything about him that one doesn't like or that offends and if I think about it he's quite average.  But that's clever writing because the Salander character is so off the wall that she needs an opposite or the book would be too cluttered with complex characters and one would lose the subtleties.  Salander's character is offensive in every way (that is, if the reader is easilly offended):  she's rude and anti-social, tattoo-ed all over, her morals are highly questionable and she breaks the law at almost every turn.  In fact, she's so pathetic that one is almost compelled to feel sorry for her and root for her.  This is one area where I would criticise and say that her character is perhaps too cliched and one or two 'normal' attributes would have balanced her out better.<br /><br />I just loved the fact that's it's set in Sweden.  As a South African who was wheaned mostly on British and American literature it's extremely refreshing to venture into such a foreign setting in this book.  It's not the usual old Chicago or London or Madrid or Paris (or Cape Town, for that matter), no it's Uppsala and Stockholm and Hedestad.  Just saying it sounds romantic.<br /><br />To be honest, the plot isn't the absolute best I've ever read and the conclusion of the Harriet Vanger disappearance as well as the OTHER issue (there's a twist, obviously) had some parts to it where I thought Larsson had been smoking pot.  HOWEVER, the combination of interesting characters, a great setting and a clever(for the most part) plot all combine to make this book a very enjoyable read and I would definietly recommed it.en.

B00280LYIC|5.0|One word. AWESOME!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! This book surrounds Percy Jackson, and is an extremely hilarious twist on greek myths. For example, Mount Olympus is over the empire state building. Full of action and hilarity....I have read it over ten times. It never gets old...
031606792X|1.0|I loved the first three books. I felt very involved with the characters and cared what happened to them. When I read this, I felt like I wasn't reading a story with the same characters. They were the same by name only. Things I didn't like (spoilers)<br /><br />1. Bella \\"Ok I'll marry you for sex\\"<br />2. The alien 'Nudger' baby and Rosalie all of a sudden BFFs with Bella<br />3. As many have said, no one has to sacrifice anything! Shouldn't Bella, who's transformation into a vampire albeit painful really wasn't that hard, feel some sort of loss or pain due to the sacrifice she's made? Shouldn't Charlie be terrified of her? Or Jacob, disgusted by the whole thing, leaves? No. Instead she gets the hunk, gets the new family, keeps her human family, and the guy who she's strung along for 3 novels is still in her life as a glorified baby sitter. And everyone lives happily ever after! For 3 novels, the Cullens have sacrificed exposure, the volturri (in New Moon), the newborns, and then in BD all they have is a very serious talk with the Volturri??? Give me a break! Where's the conflict, struggle, sacrifice?<br />4. The imprinting on the creepy alien newborn...Yuck! (Maybe it was just me, but I keep picturing it as one of those computer animation monsters that looks kind of human but has huge eyes and jagged teeth. I never got past Renesmee - stupidest name ever - being an IT). I must say that the imprinting thing throughout the books bothered me. So what he babysits her, changes her diapers, and when she comes of age it turns into \\"hey sexy\\"? more Yuck!<br />5. The birthing scene...even more Yuck! Really, Edward has to chew the baby out? I mean, no sex god forbid, but creepy horrifying brutal birthing scene? Sure!<br />6. All the build up to their 'first time' and it fades to black. Ok we aren't reading porn here but still - Have Bella talk about it being magical or sparkly. They barely cover it.<br />7. Let's introduce a million characters at the end. So many you have toput a geneology at the end. Why? Why? When I got to this point, I was half expecting Wolverine or Magneto to come around. All these mutants...er...vampires with special powers were really obnoxious to keep straight.<br />8.  When I say this, I say it incredulously... Did anyone else get bothered at how many times that word came up, in all the books? I know she's no literary genius (nor am I but I'm not making millions selling books) but she used that word over and over. Irked me to no end.<br />9. I truly felt as I was reading this, and I've spoken to others that have read it who have agreed, that it was ghost written. It is so far out there from the other books. I am really disappointed and let down.<br /><br />In Summary: I hated the book, wished I hadn't paid for it (someone offered to loan it to me but I wanted to have the 'complete saga'), glad amazon had it cheap, hope they don't make this travesty into a movie, and wish I could go back in time to finish with just 'Eclipse' and make up my own conclusion in my head.
0316069906|5.0|This book is dangerous in the best possible way - it is wonderfully written (I'd read anything Mr. Foer wrote at this point, he writes so well), and clearly an act of love, daring and courage.  I can only imagine that the factory farming industry is freaking out over this one. I've read Michael Pollan's books (am a big fan) and quite a few others about organic food and sources of food, but this is another thing entirely - Mr. Foer describes what happens so the facts are right out there and it's hard to look away.  He opens the curtain wide on practices that are abhorrent and makes even avowed meat eaters like me consider that they should change their ways and either become vegetarian or seriously consider changing their buying and eating practices to avoid factory farmed meat.  I suspect this book shows the tip of the iceberg, since Mr. Foer doesn't get into practices of making eggs and cheese that are probably also problematic.  It's sometimes a hard read since there's no sugar coating the practices he describes, and it's very upsetting.  It's also very important.  This should be required reading for all meat eaters, so at least they know what they are dealing with.  Kudos to Mr. Foer, I hope this sparks some kind of revolution - both in terms of the society at large and in each person who reads it, to finally make a change.
0375842209|4.0|I found this children's book interesting because it dealt with puzzles that hit us adults hard but that we usually find ways to avoid.  War, and war told from the viewpoint of \\"death\\", allows us to confront the peculiar futility and hopelessness of \\"real\\" life, with the preciousness of life and how one can learn to live in between the cracks in the world with a measure of joy and love.  A children's book allows an author to explore such a deep theme that would merely come across as rather mawkish in a book intended for adults.

0061914177|1.0|While Gary Vaynerchuck would definitely be my pick if Ben Affleck was unavailable to give his famous Boiler Room speeches, Vaynerchuck is a zero as author.      Crush It is appalling.  Yes, the clichés are overwhelming.  Yes, the triteness is underwhelming.  Yes, the repetition is mind-numbing. But it's the lack of substance in Crush It that really turns me off.     This book screams \\"be passionate\\" so loudly, so frequently, and so sweetly that it becomes a siren song focused on luring the audience from their jobs into the role of fulltime blogger.  Lost in Gary's shouting is the unquestionable truth that success has as much to do with the strategy, the team, and preparation as it does the desire to \\"crush it.\\"     Gary preaches a \\"shoot first, aim later\\" strategy (consistent with many of the so-called social media experts in emerging media).  This gospel is actually a dangerous blend of motivational speaking and business ignorance based solely upon an extrapolation of Gary's own personal experience.    Gary is one of the most talented self-promoters in the United States.  Unfortunately, he missed a golden opportunity to tell his story and share some broad principles.  This is the classic trap of the narcissist.  By turning his own experience into a \\"How To\\" guide that promises a path to replicating his own success, he grossly disserves the reader.     As a result, instead of learning from a genius marketer's experience, we listen to an over-the-top tirade against the typical business world (\\"traditional resumes are... irrelevant\\"; \\"Social Media = Business.  Period\\"; \\"If you want it badly enough, the money is there\\").  And we hear him tout his own formula for crushing it.  It's something to the effect of: quit your job, blog all day until 3am, start taking steps to get on the lecture circuit, and then P&G will offer you a job as their spokesperson.     I emailed Gary to push him on some elements of his logic:    On Dec 1, 2009, at 9:52 PM, Zach wrote:    Love the book, but surprised at how much you mention your email address.

B002BSHWUU|5.0|Not much to add to previous 5-star reviews, both the sound quality and the packaging are simply great.   To me, the proof that this was a project done with great care is the fact that all the songs in the 14 CDs are at a very consistent volume level, meaning  that you if you listen to all of the songs in random order you don't have to make any volume adjustments in your CD player or iPod.  As obvious as this might sound,  I have learned from previous remasters of other Artists' catalogues that this is not Something you can take for granted: many times each album is remastered independently of all others,  and this results in widely different sound volume levels when you listen to the entire discography.  Not so in this collection.  Also, a nice detail... In the back of the Box you can read:  \\"217 songs - Remastered for Superior Sound\\".   But actually, if you count them, there are 226 tracks...  So what gives ?   The explanation, I believe, is that the same version of both  \\"Yellow Submarine\\" and \\"All You Need Is Love\\"  appear twice in the collection (in Revolver / Yellow Submarine  and  Magical Mystery Tour / Yellow Submarine,  respectively) so they are counted only once;   and the 7 orchestral George Martin tracks in Yellow Submarine are not counted at all.  So 226-2-7= 217.   Very honest calculation to me   :)       All in all, a very nice job, congratulations EMI guys !!

However, it was interspersed with regular camera work and I didn't end up with a headache as a result.<br /><br />The special effects are outstanding, especially with the alien visitor icky bugs. Using their real speech with sub-titles was a stroke of genius.<br /><br />The hero starts out as a slimy kind of doofus character, but changes as the movie goes along. By the end... well, you have to see it.<br /><br />Overall, this was a well-done icky bug thriller, though the blatant political overtones cannot be ignored. Recommended.
B002RSDW80|3.0|Julie & Julia is a good movie.But not the movie it could have been.  This should have been a film entirely based on \\"My Life in France\\".    Which would have made for a much better film. (rather) Than intertwining one good book with one uninteresting one.  I don't really care to read about some boring twenty-something's search for meaning in her life by cooking her way through \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\". (which by the way, is a very good read in it's own right!).    Julie Powell can only be called a real writer, when she publishes at least two more best selling books. \\"That's the Rule\\"!   Nora Eprhon is a great director, especially when it comes to films involving food! I don't fault her on how the film was made. It was fun to watch. (at least the  scenes with Ms. Streep doing a masterful job playing the beloved Julia Child. And Stanley Tucci was no slouch either!   I just didn't find the Amy Adams charecter of Julie Powell interesting enough to really care about her at all.   As I said before, this would have been a much better movie, if it was All about Julia and how she went from being a diplomat's wife, to one of the most beloved icons in food history.   By the way, I wrote this review without reading any of the other review done by guys. We seem to agree on this one.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|We got this because Chris Pine, the new Captain Kirk was in it. I can say he certainly doesn't play the hero in this one!<br /><br />The story is a depressing take on one version of the apocalypse, where disease is the main culprit. However, the way the humans act toward each other is far worse than the disease. This was also similar to the quote on the back of the movie box. Many times those quotes seem to have little to do with the actual movie, but this time, they got it right.<br /><br />None of the characters are all that likable, so when one bites it, it is no big loss. And in the end, the survivors could have been any one of them and it wouldn't have mattered. Just the fact that some of them made it to the end is good enough.<br /><br />I hate it when the hero dies, but in this case, there really isn't one, just a group of four people trying to get someplace safe.<br /><br />Overall, this was a decent movie, especially being only +/- 85 minutes. It was short enough that it didn't have time to drag. Very well done. Recommended.
B002T9H2LK|5.0|I just wanted to comment on the idea that this movie is \\"war porn\\" or somehow diminishes US vets.  Saving Private Ryan is my favorite movie.  I am a combat vet of Operation Iraqi Freedom.   So I tend to be sensitive to how liberal Hollywood treats veterans.   There are a few scenes in Basterds where  - not to spoil the movie -you sort of see military heroism from the Nazi side.   Those are actually a little hard to watch.  One scene is reminiscent of a scene in Private Ryan, but it is a reversal.  If anything they drive home the fact that war is terrible and are by no means any kind of slam on US vets.   Anyway it's a very funny well acted movie.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I'll spare the boring ramble of many of the reviewers.  I own thousands & thousands of CDs & records.  In many cases, remastering is simply a cash grab for the record companies.  However, if you own the 1987 versions of the Beatles British albums, they sound bad...  The 2009 remasters (because this is what it is) sound sonically fantastic.  You can hear Paul's bass for the 1st time & other various instrumentations I didn't even realize were there.  If you're a casual listener, pick up the Beatles number 1s & Past Masters.  If you're a passionate listener of the Beatles, this collection is a must (mono or stereo) because this group truly started modern rock 'n' roll...<br />Listen & you won't be disappointed...
B001UDYI9K|4.0|As a fan of The Alan Parsons Project (not Alan Parsons recordings) this CD was a great return to the roots as Eric Woolfson voice and compositions were an essential part of the project. If you enjoyed the Alan Parsons Project era give a try to this recording which will drive you back to those great days when APP music was all over around.
1932907009|3.0|This book is at its best when it's arguing why \\"Schindler's List\\" and \\"Die Hard\\" should belong in the same basic category, or drawing up 15-beat lists that a good script should shoot for.<br /><br />Not so much when it repeatedly references the author's own 'Blank Check' as the go-to film for excellent structure and pitch-perfect storytelling.  Yknow.  Because 'Blank Check' was hackneyed and awful.<br /><br />Of course we can't forget 'Stop or My Mom Will Shoot', which SYLVESTER GODDAMN STALLONE said was the worst movie he's ever been a part of.<br /><br />I get the sense that Mr. Snyder is more like a film critic who wrote a movie than a screenwriter who wrote a book, but that doesn't change the result: Save The Cat is a respectable guide on how to structure a salable, competent piece of storytelling.
6303224644|5.0|This is a great film with a wonderful cast, classic musical-comedy script for the era, great songs... make it part of your film library... especially nice film to view during the Christmas season!
B002HEOLH0|5.0|Rarely do I ever take time to review a purchase anywhere...in fact, this might be my first one on Amazon.    I enjoyed Daughtry's first CD so much, I figured I'd be disappointed with this one.  I bought it primarily for \\"No Surprise\\", but have since fallen in love with at least 6 or 7 other songs on the album.    Incredible. You will not be disappointed.
0316017922|5.0|What a great read... went really quick. Targeted for the general reader. Gladwell made so many relevant connections between intricacies of our daily lives. I look forward to reading more of his books.    If you're even marginally curious about this book, you really should read it. You'll come away with a newfound appreciation for hard work, persistence and diversity.
B000ZELISO|4.0|it was a great moive but a bit to long for me i had to watch it in parts but other then that i hope the last one well explain more about everything but i have to wonder if its going to be a bit longer then this one was i wonder lol.
B001UV4XUG|4.0|The two stars Joseph Gordon-Levitt (from Third Rock TV Show) and Zooey Deschanel (Failure to Launch) are almost too good for this film.  They are great characters and the movie is funny.  Tom (Gordon-Levitt) is the star.  He writes and creates greeting cards but has higher aspirations.  Tom wants to be an architect.  Zooey is Summer, a sweet and beautiful quirky girl.  The film goes back and forth in time, and we see a complicated relationship, often troubled with some communications problems.  It is typical romantic piece, and satisfyingly fun to watch.
B00005O3VC|1.0|It is a terrible PG movie.  I checked this out from my local publick library to view with my two kids (11 & 10) during the holiday season.  I got it because it is rated PG.  We kept watching and waiting for a funny good story but none.  Instead, we got many words not appropriate for kids, such as, oral sex.  We adults were shocked to hear those words.  Who did the rating of this movie!?  Bad for family with kids.
B002BU0DPE|5.0|Bought these based on the reviews and was not disappointed one bit.  These allow you to hear things that you never know were in the game and allow you to find things based on sound.  Gameplay feels much better when you hear everything as it was meant to and they are really comfortable for extended play sessions.
0596009208|3.0|I'm new to Java, but ancient in the world of programming (30 years of experience).  When I am able to find a topic that I need to check on, this book gives a pretty good explanation of that topic.  But finding the topic is a major problem.  The index is ridiculously short for a book of over 680 pages.  Most of the terms I need to look at (I am examining Java code written by experts and trying to figure out what it all means so that some day, maybe I will be able to write some myself) aren't in the index.  As easy as it is with today's word processors to automatically generate an index, there is no excuse for having such an incomplete index.  A second, associated, gripe I have is that there isn't an electronic copy (preferably PDF) of the book on a CD.  Then I could do my term search using Acrobat Reader and not have to worry about the incomplete index provided.  But, no CD with this book.  I will probably go back to the Dietel and Dietel book as my reference.

B001CTDH76|5.0|I just finished watching the last DVD, this show is by far one of the best shows on tv. Basically its about Patrick Jane who after certain life events dedicates his life to helping the CBI, (California Bureau of Investigation) solve murders, or close cases so to speak. It isn't really a CSI rip off its all about observation. He strings together subtle clues, and shows how a professional Mentalist does his work. If you have not seen I would buy the whole series it is amazing.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|I admire the style of this movie.  But the first half mocumentary was very hard to watch.  Like the original Star Trek TV series, this is a social commentary disguised as Science Fiction. It browbeats you over & over again about what happened in South Africa, substituting Aliens for the Black Africans.  Yes, what happened there wasn't right, but do we have to see it dramatized as a documentary over & over again?  Even with almost 20 minutes of the oiginal documentary footage edited out, it still plays too long. Strangely the producers say they were not over preachy about their topic.<br /><br />The \\"hero\\" of this movie is hardly anyone to like, and no characters are developed to help bring the story around.<br /><br />This is pure shoot-em-up, blood spurting (& landing on the camera's lens) action with little real story or character developement to follow.  And what little story there is never really gets resolved.  Who are these people & aliens in this story?  You will never really know, they are more like players in a video game.<br /><br />The producers admit that they originally gathered to produce the HALO movie.  When that fell through for them they ran across this script.  This probably explains why it feels like a video game.<br /><br />Is it a bad movie?  No. But it is not something to watch over & over again.  One viewing is enough, and I was tempted to hit the fast-foward button quite a few times.
B000059XUO|3.0|I've loved this movie since I saw it in the theaters.  Owned the VHS for years and figured it was time to upgrade to DVD.  That turned out to be pointless, I could've dubbed my VHS to DVD myself.  I could've let my 3 yr old niece dub it from VHS and she couldn't have done worse.  There is some sort of strange grid pattern throughout the movie and tons of noise in the picture.  Reminds me of watching my family's old 8mm home movies.  Seems a common complaint among anyone who seems to comment on picture quality.  Aren't a lot of options out there, but know what you're getting.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|This Sci-Fi film, with its unique blend of fantasy and reality, developed with the painstaking use of both CGI and 3D technologies, overtakes them all and should take the Oscar as the best film of 2009. Avatar is a basic story of an evil empire of infinite superiority invading a lush, paradisian rain forest on the planet Pandora in order to plunder its vital mineral resources. Unfortunately, the mining operations on the planet must take place at a location occupied by a civilization of tall, blue, large-eyed, gentle inhabitants, the Na'vi. And, also unfortunately, it's the Marines who are tasked to ensure that the job gets done, in the event that Avatars cannot talk the peaceful tribe into giving up their Eden-like homeland. Avatars are scientific transformations of humans designed to look like the Na'vi for the purpose of infiltrating and studing them.     Acting is more than adequate and all the characters are both likable and credible: Sam Worthington as Jake Sully, the disabled ex-marine whose avatar clone makes friends with the Na'vi and who falls in love with the cute Na'vi princess, Neytiri played by Zoe Saldana; Sigourney Weaver as Dr. Grace Augustine, the scientist responsible for Avatar development and experimentation; Stephen Lang as the mean, single-minded Colonel Miles Quaritch, leader of the marine assault force; and Michelle Rodriguez, as the enthusiastic marine chopper pilot.    Obviously, the time spent developing the blue Na'vi animations and the lush jungle landscape results in a mind boggling scenic stage for the actors and primitive creatures to interact. The colors, flora, jaguars, and perydactyl-like birds are impressively rendered. The Na'vi animations are about as visually realistic as they can be, and as the story unfolds, and it becomes clearer what they have to lose, they become worthy of your sympathy as they suffer through the brutal invasion.     The only aspect I disliked was the use of \\"shock and awe\\" to describe the Marines'impending attack of the Na'vi, an obvious jab by Cameron to compare it with U.S. invasion of Iraq, a mission to stop evil. It certainly does nothing to convince anyone in the world that the U.S. is on a mission to fight evil and terrorism. I found this disturbing because of what takes place later in the battle scenes. On the whole though, I can look at the marines in this movie as perhaps being part of a rouge group that violates their original orders to protect rather than assault - that works for me.     But don't let any \\"message\\", intended or unintended, ruin your viewing entertainment. It is in the end, an extremely good movie, and it will transport you into an incredible world. The movie will be perfect for your home theater when it's released.
B001RIY4WE|4.0|Anyone in the mkt to buy a Blu-ray movie with fantastic special effects needn't look any further.  Albeit this is one of my favorite movies of all times, it should be noted that like other movies of the time it is easier to pick out minor flaws as they were not produced for this kind of high-definition.
B001FB4W0C|5.0|This has to be the best season yet to be available for sale as DVD series collection. I am patiently watching this seasons (#5) on Thursday nights... It is SUPERnatural.  [[ASIN:B001FB4W0C Supernatural: The Complete Fourth Season]]
B002T9H2LA|3.0|I finally figured out what Tarantino was trying to say in his satirical way. \\"This is [NOT] the face of Jewish vengance\\" although it could be or \\"should\\" be - no the Jewish people are forgiving, unracist (for the most part), and still contribitute to society. The point is that perhaps this attitude of vengance could be justified; but that is not the face of the Jew today.
B001GJOL22|5.0|Just thought I'd write this to let potential buyers know that there are NO audio sync issues with this excellent Blu-Ray.     Audio sync is a new problem with LCD/Plasma TVs. This happens because of additional video processing that the TVs go through. So, if you are watching normal TV using the speakers on the television this isn't a problem as the internal audio is delayed to \\"catch up\\" with the picture.     Problems arise when you take the audio from the Blu-Ray player and hook it up to an A/V amplifier as the audio is then not delayed and is out-of-sync with the picture. I suspect this set-up is familiar to the people that have noticed the sync problems as it's apparent more with music than movies.     There are two solutions:   1. Take the audio feed from the TV to the A/V amp using phono connections, but you will only get a stereo or at best a pro logic signal (no DD or DTS)   or, 2. Check to see if your player has an \\"Audio Sync adjust\\" setting in the player's menu (I know most Sony players have this so I'm sure other manufacturers will too).     Hope this is of some help. The Rush disc is excellent and I wouldn't want people to be put off buying it if they thought there were going to be problems.
B0015OKWL2|4.0|The truth is DeNiro and Pacino have both made some very humdrum movies in recent years, but this isn't one of them. Yes, DeNiro has seemingly played this role 1,000 times before, but Pacino's character has a bit more originality. Both are jaded NYPD vets, but still with a few good days left in them. The bad guys, except for 50 Cent, are all pretty forgettable. And though Brian Dennehy plays the cop boss, he isn't given much to do. The movie is all about DeNiro and Pacino. The pacing is quick, and the dialogue is relatively smart. Enough twists to make this worthwhile.
1415954402|5.0|My wife read the book and insisted I listen to it during our Christmas travels in the car.  All I can say is that it was a treat.  The several readers made the letter format of the book come alive.  The different voices enhanced the experience.  There is more to say but the best praise I can give it was that I was anxious to get back to the car on our seven hour drive so I could hear more of the recording. Great job to all.
0802130208|5.0|COD is a marvelous treat.  Ridiculous, insightful, erudite  and deliciously low-brow like  Henry Fielding's Tom Jones.  I wish those one-star reviewers had checked their outraged \\"good taste\\" at page one.
B00005ATQF|2.0|Full Metal Jacket, 1987 film    Young men are getting a recruit's haircut; this marks them. They are given a welcoming speech by the Gunnery Sergeant. This is not a recruiting film. [The language is raw, but sort of funny in an exaggerated way.] They are taught to distinguish their rifle from a gun (artillery). \\"Gomer Pyle\\" has problems. [I wonder if such training was used in World War One and Two?] Gunny uses peer pressure against \\"Pyle\\". He has a \\"bad dream\\"! The Marines are taught how to shoot accurately. They finish their training and graduate. Most will go to Vietnam. There is a dramatic scene in the head when Leonard disobeys orders. [How realistic is this?]    They arrive in Vietnam and learn to communicate with the indigenous people and learn the culture. The correct phrase is \\"sweep and clear\\" not \\"search and destroy\\". There are two types of stories published. It is the Lunar New Year. The Marines shoot at the figures who are far away. Joker will be sent to cover the front. One man in a helicopter shoots at the people on the ground. They arrive at the combat zone and find dead civilians. Was that speech by the Colonel supposed to be funny? They meet some frontline troops. There is enemy action and casualties. They photograph the troops, who speak their lines. There is a scene that wouldn't be shown on the 7 o'clock news. The Marines patrol the ruins of a city to check the report. A booby trap claims a victim. The follow the map. Was there a mistake? The enemy shoots the point man to draw in those who want to rescue him. \\"Where's the sniper?\\" Did one man stand in an exposed position? The Marines are able to neutralize the sniper. This scene is drawn out for dramatic effect and commentary on combat. What song do they sing as a final comment?    The credits roll, the cast is shown in tiny type. \\"Filmed on location.\\" The story was not designed to be a popular success. So who put up the funds for it? Was it designed to be a loss to offset profits from other successful investments? Oliver Stone's \\"Platoon\\" is still the best movie on the war on Vietnam. This is based on Gustav Hasford's novel \\"The Short-Timers\\". The first part of the film shows the psychological conditioning of recruits. Do they get any reconditioning before they are returned to civilian life? I wonder if anyone realized that forty years later America would be shipping factories to Vietnam and China?
B00304LF0W|4.0|This movie was really good.  My wife and I got chills during the movie.  A lot better than the Blair Witch Project.  Other reviews sound a lot like the boyfriend moking whats happening but from other perspectives it can get pretty chilling.
0399215921|2.0|This is one of my son's favorite stories. He smiles as we point out each animal and he always sits still through the entire book. I bought this copy as a gift for a friend's new baby along with several other favorite children's book. Maybe I should have been able to pick this up from the listing, but it is TINY. It is not the nice sized board book we know and love. It is a hardback with paper pages. There is no way we'd be able to read this one any time soon and I think the size would take away from the lovely pictures. Very disappointed!
B002UJIY70|5.0|There was great acting and suspense.  The director came up with some original  usage of split scenes, that embellish the movie and made it more interesting.  When  the action started, Matrix action took over.  You felt drawn into the film and you   were right there, fighting along side of actors.  Great creativity and good action.    And the guy with the glasses, just great, good performance and believable.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was impressed that the description of the used CD I wanted stated that it was in excellent condition.  That was very important to me, and it was!  The only thing that caught me off guard is that when I received my safely packaged CD from the previous owner, since I did not recognize the name or return address, it sat on my table for a day (giving me time to remember I had ordered the CD) and realize that it was safe to open.  As indicated, I obviously have not ordered many items through Amazon, but I have NEVER been disappointed with my transactions.  Di M
B002A9OJ0Q|5.0|Coundn't find this on Napster or iTunes so I got this import CD. I love it. Kind of has an 80s touch to it. Makes you rock in your seat and sing along. Totally awesome and worth every penny.
0375842209|5.0|This book is very unique in style and narrative form -- also would be a very good read for a younger adult/teenager who is getting into the more adult novel format.  I enjoyed it thoroughly.
1932100660|5.0|A masterful, well-researched and stunning book that clearly and logically shows where we are headed if we continue down the path of the standard american diet, and shows how we can break free and take control of our food and our health.
B000KRNCYY|5.0|My son surprised me with this CD for Christmas after finding it on my Amazon Wish List.  I had forgotten that I had added it to my Wish List, but what a great Christmas present it was!  Generally I prefer instrumental music, but I also love Irish music, and Celtic Woman has such soothing voices that their music ranks right up there with great instrumentals as far as I am concerned.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|I was 15 when the Beatles came into my life. I am now 60 and still enjoy listening to and singing along with the Beatles songs. I received the stereo box set for Christmas and thoroughly enjoy the remastered songs. I consider myself an audiophile, but haven't gone to extremes like some others who call themselves audiophiles. I have a sound system that pleases my ears. Everyone hears things a little (or a lot) differently. Listen to these cd's on equipment that suites you.   The sound remixes ARE better than anything I have heard. I grew up with mono records. Stereo lead to more depth and seperation. The newer technologies have brought more clarity and new life to the old recording methods of the 60's. Ringos drums have come to life, the clapping in the backround in the recordings bring a new sound the remixed recordings. Listen for yourself. Please, enjoy the old recordings with a renewed enthusiam.
B001TH16DI|4.0|Amazon's bargain price makes it worthwhile to own all these oldies from the original cast (though I think I and IV are very good, and with a message still valid today). The seventh disk, The Captain Summit, is very interesting and valuable for your collection. I really did enjoy it.<br /><br />A couple of caveats though. First, the \\"primitive\\" special effects from the 80s look really awful on high resolution, particularly for the first movie (though I guess die hard trekkers will not mind), as digital images magnify the roughness of the simpler SFx of that time (e.g. the small shuttle going around the docked Enterprise made my children laugh a lot), and second, the digital sound is great, but the volume is so high that sometimes you can hardly listen to the dialogue. Was the package produced in a hurry?<br /><br />For new Star Trek fans a better start will be the [[ASIN:B002I9Z8GW Star Trek: The Next Generation Motion Picture Collection [Blu-ray]]] as the transfer to Blu-ray is much better because these movies were filmed with much advanced technology than the movies from the original series.
B000YAA68C|4.0|P.S. I love you is a good movie, and this DVD comes with deleted scenes and a commentary (which I have yet to watch!) I don't typically like chick flicks, but I am a fan of this movie. The deleted scenes were awesome too!
B002BSHWUU|4.0|I opted for the Stereo set because the price was much less for more material then the MONO. The MONO tracks included in this set satisfy my curisity. There dosen't seem to be a huge difference in the sound,however some tracks stand out with incredably sound.The packaging is just awful. The discs are so tight in the cardboard cases you either open the glued bonding or grip the disc tightly causing fingerprints. \\"Past Masters\\" has one compartment for 2 discs so they are stored tightly against each other. I also had trouble with the box and sleave that stores all the discs. This set is certainly worth owning just to have all The Beatles Albums together and the nice booklets that come with each set.
B001FOR5XU|5.0|The loneliness and despair of Robert Neville are thoroughly expressed and provided with slight imagery in this novel. The storyline falls on classic vampire stories along with real modern day science.<br />Robert Neville is a man living in the late 1970's; alone. He seems to be the only living human on earth; after something had turned everyone else into bloodsucking living dead. He spends his time fixing and re-fixing his house, drinking, and trying to figure out exactly what these creatures are; how they work, and how they changed into such.<br />To examine and comprehend the lives and motives of the \\"vampires\\", Robert researches tales such as Dracula; along with deep scientific experimentation books. The story at first seems to revolve only around the vampires and the reason of their existence, but the reader will see that throughout the story it is about one man struggling with surviving through not only the risk of death from the vampires, but from his own suicidal thoughts.<br />I thought this book was well written and had a flowing and constant voice the entire way through; even through Robert's changes. It was interesting and hard to put down. The author, Richard Matheson, although he made it easy to follow, a person had to focus on the hidden details and thoughts of Robert to be able to solve the scientific cause of these vampires.
B002VPE1AM|1.0|James Cameron has made one--count it, one--good film: 1984's \\"Terminator.\\"  \\"Avatar\\" is a decidedly bad movie, one that could well be titled (descriptively) \\"Interminable.\\" The only interesting feature of the film is the special effect work, and that is no better looking than many video games; it's hard to imagine anyone who could not imagine better effects, and there's no reason to bother watching this film, as the special effects will be par for the course in a matter of two or three years.  The movie, mind, is not in any way a science fiction film: it's a flimsy fantasy full of utterly unconvincing characters and an utterly ridiculous, hopelessly anthropomorphic bunch of \\"aliens.\\" Stay far away.
B0012QE4Q2|5.0|Two sisters, Anne and Mary Boleyn, are driven by their ambitious Father and Uncle to advance the family's power and status by courting the affections of the King of England. Leaving behind the simplicity of country life, the girls are thrust into the dangerous and thrilling world of court life--and what began as a bid to help their family develops into a ruthless rivalry between Anne and Mary for the love of the King. Initially, Mary wins King Henry's favor and becomes his mistress, bearing him two illegitimate children. But Anne, clever, conniving and fearless, edges aside both her sister and Henry's wife, Queen Katherine of Aragon, in her relentless pursuit of the King. Despite Mary's genuine feelings for Henry, her sister Anne has her sights set on the ultimate prize; Anne will not stop until she is Queen of England. As the Boleyn girls battle for the love of a King--one driven by ambition, the other by true affection--England is torn apart. An enjoyable movie with an entertaining angle on a hard-to-resist period of history.
B002T9H2ME|5.0|Moon is exactly what the Sci-Fi genre needed in 2009. Duncan Jones didn't need tons of glitz, glamor, and special effects to hold the viewer's attention through all 90 minutes of this amazing film. Moon is both compelling and thought-provoking, without being preachy about the subject matter. Sam Rockwell did an amazing job developing his character and displaying pretty much every emotion imaginable, without seeming forced at all. I would've liked to have seen the family situation given a little more time, and I wasn't blown away with GERTY's role in the film. Why would a billion/trillion dollar corporation completely blow the programming on the one robot that is essential to their sustained success? There are obvious similarities to HAL in \\"2001,\\" but with a more generic and \\"acceptable\\" conclusion. This bugged me a little, but not enough to jade my overall view on the film. The ending could've been given a little more time to develop and \\"finalize\\" the whole situation, but it still worked. Overall, Moon is a highly enjoyable movie, and hopefully a sign of stellar films to come from rookie director Duncan Jones.
B000BYA5GO|5.0|Yuri Orlov is a globetrotting arms dealer. Through some of the deadliest war zones, Yuri struggles to stay one step ahead of a relentless Interpol agent, his business rivals, even some of his customers who include many of the world's most notorious dictators. Finally, Yuri must also face his own conscience. This movie is not much of an anti-war or anti-bush or anti-guns movie. It was much deeper than that. It was about doing things that we aren't necessarily proud of for personal gain; this is something that we all face. Also, at the end the movie mentions that the top 5 nations that export weapons are the United States, France, Britain, China, and Russia. It then says that these are the only permanent members of the U.N. Security Council. That is an interesting fact. I urge you to see this because it is not a movie you watch, it is yourself that you watch.
0061537969|5.0|\\"The full moon rises. The fog clings to the lower branches of the spruce trees. The man steps out of the darkest corner of the forest and finds himself transformed into....  A monkey?  I think not.\\"  And thus begins the hilarious, heart-breaking, philosophical, loving, life journey of our narrator Enzo. No ordinary canine, this Enzo tells the story of his human companions and the bond that unites man and his dog. Denny is a professional race driver who explains to Enzo all the nuances of racing while they watch racing films together. The reader soon realizes that \\"That which you manifest is before you\\" is more than just a mantra for Denny,  it is the secret of his life. We are caught up in the tragedy of the death of Eve, the custody battle for Zoe, the situation of the Evil Twins, the true friendships of Mike and Tony, and the physical problems of Enzo. We are introduced to the art of car racing, and Denny's knowledge and understanding of the physical and mental aspects of the skill. We are educated in the traditions of the great cars and the race drivers who lived and died at the wheel. Through all of the drama of this story, Enzo tells us of his view of human life and his own struggle to be a part of it.  I know nothing about racing, and I only recognized two names in the entire book: Chinetti and Jackie Stewart. It is not important to know about racing, because this story is about life. All the elements of a great drama are here. The hints of impeding events are easily picked up by an experienced reader, yet it does not change the emotional impact.  I found myself screeching with laughter over Enzo's revenge over the Evil Twins, and I cringed with his fear of the demon giraffe. I understood his idea of loneliness as a virus that invades us, and I felt his rage in the killing of the squirrel. I knew what was coming, yet I found myself wiping away tears at the end. I will read this book again because I had to finish it before I could absorb it all.
B00002ND77|5.0|Biographical drama on the life of the late Malcolm X, who was assassinated on February 21, 1965. A black man who went from jail to leading a revolution. This is a great educational movie, to help everybody learn about Malcolm X. Denzel Washington gives an outstanding performance, no one else could have done it so well. The DVD I have, has a special feature documentary of the real Malcolm X. I've never seen anyone more charismatic than him.

But I just happened up on this one by accident and fell in love with this artist's voice and the songs, also the incredible music! Miss Gardot's voice has a hauntingly beautiful sound. This is a whole different style of music than I ever even listen too, but take my word, once you listen to it, you'll be hooked! Thanks Amazon, Now Miss Gardot has a brand new fan of her great music!

B001P3SA94|4.0|The rise and fall of Chess Records, which launched the careers of Muddy Waters, Etta James and Chuck Berry. Leonard Chess scoured the South, checking out the various blues scenes and selling records from the back of his Cadillac. The soundtrack, more than anything else, is what makes this movie so enjoyable.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|This film features such exciting scenes as people sleeping, people brushing their teeth, people chatting about nothing, etc.  It is not scary, exciting, interesting, or anything else.  One thing I noticed throughout the whole thing was the complete lack of authentic emotion.  At the end there is one ghost.  A billion monkeys on a billion webcams ...  Not worth watching.
B0012Q732O|5.0|In a remote mountain tribe, the young hunter, D'Leh, has found his heart's passion - the beautiful Evolet. When a band of mysterious warlords raid his village and kidnap Evolet, D'Leh is forced to lead a small group of hunters to pursue the warlords to the end of the world to save her. Driven by destiny, the unlikely band of warriors must battle saber-tooth tigers and prehistoric predators and, at their heroic journey's end, they uncover a Lost Civilization. Their ultimate fate lies in an empire beyond imagination, where great pyramids reach into the skies. Here they will take their stand against a powerful god who has brutally enslaved their people. 10,000 BC, is a great ride that takes you through a sweeping landscape of honor, pride and standing up for one's self and each other. The movies message is a good one. See it...enjoy it for what it is worth.
1421532255|4.0|If you are like me and have read all of the Death Note mangas, watched the anime and the live action and you still want more, this is it.    It takes place in the live action movie world of Death Note, not the manga or anime.  I have not seen the movie version of this (I like to read the books before seeing the movie), but this is a novelization of the movie.  L has one last task before he dies - stop bioterrorists before they unleash an Ebola like virus across the planet.    It has nice nods to what has come before, there are cameos and a little more background on Wammy's House and the children trained there.  I probably would have liked this if it were longer too.  All in all, worth the read (only 188 pages!).
B002GOAH1A|5.0|Special government agent James West and his co-hort Artemus Gordon, team up to thwart the diabolical Dr Arliss Loveless who is plotting to assassinate the President of the United States with the aid of a huge, walking weapon-transport vehicle called \\"The Tarantula\\". This movie is definitely an acquired taste, I enjoyed it.

0790737345|5.0|An angel comes to earth and falls in love with the woman he's assigned to watch over. The actors deserve a lot of the credit. As an angel experiencing human sensation for the first time, Nicolas Cage's power of concentration is such that he can convince an audience it's witnessing his first touch, his first kiss. There's no doubting his tenderness, his elation or his innocence. City of Angels maintains the premise that there are angels everywhere, moving invisibly among us, laying hands on people when they need steadying. Very entertaining movie, I loved it.
B000003C2U|4.0|Death's output has always been more a function of the musicians assembled by mainman Chuck Schuldiner than anything else. On the first album, Autopsy's Chris Reifert kept the band in check; on the second and third, the band that later became Massacre gave the band a more aggressive, basic sound.<br /><br />On \\"Human,\\" Chuck bonded with the guys from Cynic, and they upgraded his songwriting -- and he kept them aggressive and true to the spirit of death metal. With new musical understanding of key and harmony, this album gains a spacious sense of contrast that earlier death did not have, but because it stays away from the easy heavy metal licks, has a profundity that later Death albums completely lack.<br /><br />These songs are hard-hitting and simple in structure, but complex in riff style and development, which makes them a delight to listen to. Unlike previous Death albums, \\"Human\\" has an eerie depth so that we the listeners kind of wake up three songs in and think, \\"Holy nuts! I'm immersed in the strange new world of this music!\\"<br /><br />After this CD, Death never really regained the momentum they'd had before, and started trying to be heavier Judas Priest clones, with a brief exception for \\"Sound of Perseverance.\\" But on \\"Human,\\" Death rise above everything else they've done -- even \\"Scream Bloody Gore,\\" their acerbic first album -- to make a lasting testament to their vision.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Trevor Reznik, a quiet and reserved loner who works as a machinist, is wasting away from lack of food and sleep deprivation leaving him gaunt and fatigued. After a year of suffering from severe insomnia, he is involved in an accident at the workplace that leaves a co-worker seriously injured. What follows is a dark descent into paranoia, as Trevor's downward spiral leaves him obsessed with finding out the meaning behind the strange and bizarre occurrences taking place around him. The Machinist is a gem, it's Bale's gripping, beyond-the-call-of-duty performance that makes this movie impressive.
B00192KCQ0|2.0|I will be the first to admit I wish I could write riffs like Metallica. These musicians have a deft sense of what makes a brain-locking riff, and they use this to good advantage.<br /><br />Even more, unlike most metal bands, they are well-versed in harmony and other genres, and so easily mix in rock influences -- lots of rock influences. And this is where their downfall begins.<br /><br />At this point, Metallica are essentially a \\"metal-flavored\\" band that really would rather be the Allman Brothers. This is country-metal, with lots of gritty alternative rock thrown in. And in that, it seems out of place with its image. Why not just be a regular rock band, like Bruce Springsteen and his E Street Band?<br /><br />What makes the Metallica listening experience awkward is how much they try, in order to compensate for being metal-flavored rock, to become Jesus for us. They suffer. They are ANGRY. They are rebellious! Raaaaar, fight the machine! But it all rings hollow.<br /><br />These incredibly talented musicians need a new direction and a new shtick to go with it -- the old one is obsolete and needs replacing.
6304936303|5.0|A former Secret Service agent and a former pro quarterback team up to investigate the murder of a girlfriend working as a stripper. This movie had everything! Explosions, action, great cast, and funny one-liners from Bruce Willis and Damon Wayans. There is a lot of great memorable scenes such as the explosive ending fight between Joe and Milo. This is a movie every action fan should own. See this movie and you'll known why Bruce Willis is know as THE LAST BOY SCOUT.
B000E1ZBGS|1.0|So you end up at a friend's place, and they pop this in, and five minutes later you're wishing your wife would call with a sick dog or extended family crisis so you could escape. You don't believe me? Let me explain:<br /><br />This movie takes a classic of literature, and dumbs it down so that all traces of subtlety are lost, and even further, all depth of character is lost. These people are cardboard silhouettes walking around and reacting in really obvious ways to really obvious problems; they have no souls, or character, of their own. They're actors creating generic characters that are dressed up like Jane Austen ones.<br /><br />For example, the dialogue. Gone are the complex elegant sentences; they might as well have translated it into Valley Girl, Surfer or Jive for as much as these speaking parts resemble the original. With that loss of elegance goes much of what defines each character, and it is replaced by a movie that makes the worst sin of a literary re-creation, if you ask me: a talky movie in which very little is actually said because all spoken ideas have been boiled for eight hours before serving.<br /><br />Even worse, the action. We the audience are expected to be dumb as rocks and distracted, so every action has to be jerkily symbolic in the same way traffic signs, middle fingers, and giant explosions are symbolic -- a one-dimensional, brain-dead, spoon-fed kind of way. Characters no longer maintain a tense balance of mutual respect and competition; they fight like bickering drunks. Scenes do not crackle with many different kinds of emotion, but pound us senseless with a single one.<br /><br />In short, this film is awful -- and doubly so given the better alternatives just a click away. Hollywood took a literary classic, threw it in a blender, and took parts out and pasted them into a typical Hollywood plot with typical Hollywood neurotic brain-stem characters. Now they want us to buy it presumably to turn us off from literature forever, so we can watch the latest starlet vehicle and think, \\"Well, at least it was better than that tiresome Pride and Prejudice.\\" Avoid avoid!e and think, \\"Well, at least it was better than that tiresome Pride and Prejudice.\\" Avoid avoid!
B000C20VRS|5.0|After years of diplomatic silence between the United States and Cuba, Castro opens the port of Mariel Harbor, Cuba, to thousands emmigrating to the United States in search of the American dream. Shrewdly, Castro also unlocks the overpacked prisons, allowing hordes of criminals to join the refugees. Tony Montana, a small time hood, is one of them. In Florida, Montana connects with gangster Frank Lopez, and guns his way through the sun washed streets of Miami where he finds power, wealth and passion. He kills Lopez and marries his mistress, Elvira. Montana, better known as \\"Scarface,\\" soon becomes the leader of a bloody cocaine-smuggling empire but at a terrible cost to his sister, Gina and his loyal friend, Manny. However, like that of others before him, Montana's reign is brief and a violent end is guaranteed as rival gangster compete to become the next drug lord. Those who have not seen this movie be forewarned. It is one of the most graphic, vulgar movies...well...pretty much I think ever made. definitely not for the weak of heart, unless you can handle chainsaws and point-blank shotgun kills. IF that's your thing, then this is your movie.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Like most parents, I'm always looking for positive media for my children -- shows, movies, books, comics and games that do not glorify pointless and neurotic behaviors. For this reason, I jumped at a chance to get Gilmore Girls complete on DVD. And I am 6/7 totally satisfied.<br /><br />This show is unlike anything else on TV. It's like a cross between a soap opera, a sitcom, and literature -- these characters are struggling with real dilemmas of our time. Not \\"issues,\\" not political viewpoints or other hollow symbols, but how to survive. Class, psychological control, rebellion, the balance between sex and love, and the need for affirmation are big themes.<br /><br />Most of all, you will fall in love with the characters. They will also make you think about yourself, because you will see yourself in them. To any moderately gifted child, Rory's story is familiar -- trying to stay on track to excel in school and keep a good relationship with your parents, even when drama and the excess of others threatens to take you off course. Lorelai's story is familiar to many of us in part, which is the minefield that dating as an adult can be, and the struggle of a single mother in a complex modern world.<br /><br />The first six seasons, absent the final episode, are brilliantly written with more meat than quirk, but plenty of nuance. They're not like most TV shows where wooden characters interact based on their external traits. Instead, characters have personalities, fears and desires, and they act on these -- and either rise or fall, like characters in a Hemingway novel. A compact dose of life lessons fits into just about every episode.<br /><br />From the final episode of the sixth season through all of the seventh season, however, this series descends into dreck. Out come those standard wooden Hollywood characters with their pre-fabricated drama, and they react rather than act, making for a miserably predictable and uninformative plot. Clearly the writers don't know how to end the show, and so they hack off huge parts of each character's soul in order to make obedient plastic automatons. The actors know it too and are clearly \\"phoning it in\\" while they wish for escape from these awful, poorly-written, brain-dead episodes.<br /><br />From what I've read, at the end of the sixth season the network was sold, the writers and producer got caught up in a writer's strike, and as a result the network retaliated by cutting the show short a season -- originally eight were intended -- and as a result, the original writing team ended the plot with the last episode of the sixth season and then fled, leaving behind their understudies to patch it up and make it into typical Hollywood pap.<br /><br />While the seventh season is disappointing, and the last episode of the sixth season that leads into it is also weak, the rest of this show is pure brilliance. Real people facing real dilemmas and instead of just reacting like typical TV dunces, they show some real spirit and character. As I said above, we could describe this as a collision between a sitcom and a soap opera, except for this literary component where characters have actual souls and fight for them as they navigate the obstacles of modern life.<br /><br />I think the non-broken parts of this series are great for girls from eighth grade onward and quite frankly, reflect a common-sense worldview that is compatible with family values of either political stripe. People who do dumb things get bad results. Everyone makes mistakes, but they pick up and keep going. Those who keep working toward constructive goals, whatever their place in life, are rewarded, while those who get sidetracked end up irrelevant. It's like Thomas Hardy in a digestible form, with more interesting people, and that's why I let my daughter and son watch this.ff huge parts of each character's soul in order to make obedient plastic automatons.

0800141806|5.0|Andrew Beckett is a young up-and-coming lawyer who has just been fired by his prestigious law firm. His former colleagues claim he's just not good enough; Andrew says he's been fired because he has AIDS. Determined to defend his professional reputation; Andrew hires fierce personal-injury attorney Joe Miller to represent him as he sues his former firm for wrongful termination. Separated from Andrew by a deep social and cultural chasm, Joe is initially reluctant to take the case. For Andrew the battle is clear cut--he's fighting for his reputation, his life and for justice. Joe, however, faces a different kind of struggle as he confronts his own fears and prejudices about homosexuals. Philadelphia is a brilliant movie. You have to have an open mind and not be so prejudice to understand the meaning of the movie. I recommend it to everyone.
6305313687|5.0|Going into American History X, I knew two things about the movie: 1) it was about neo nazi's 2)Edward Norton was suppose to keep constant with being an amazing actor. Apon viewing History, I left with knowing three things: 1)The writing and direction are bar none 2) Edward Norton is still a phenominal actor and 3)American History X is one helluva film.     Nazi's are characters which aren't too common in American film. Outside of being plastered by an All American protagonist assult rifle, (or by the Bear Jew's bat) Nazi's are untouched by the cinema. Never before has anyone tried to take a Nazi, a modern day Nazi at that, and turn him into a heroic character. American History X uses this as it's main hook. Edward Norton plays a reformed Neo-Nazi in Venice Beach. After being incarcerated for 3 years in prision, Derek Vinyard (Norton) looks to reform his life and save his brother from the gang life that he lead. Norton's acting in the late 90's was that of legends. AHX catipultes him on a podium of acting that is untouched by the hords of modern day preformers. His acting talents have leaked into other flicks, but with History X and Fight Club, Norton was in rare form, catipulting two revolutionary films even further.     Thematically, American History gives a good amount of social commentary where the message is prevelant, but you aren't bashed over the head. Touching on a theme that Unforgiven gave, direcotr Tony Kaye asks us, can forgiveness be an option to a person with such a terrible history? Mixing themes of race, gang life, and redemption, American History message is left blatently open, but is strong and powerful.     American History X blew me away. I intially thought X would showcase the downfall of a man with no morals. Instead, I was introduced to a cast of mentally complex characters that grow and evolve. As brutal as it is brilliant, AHX is rated R for good reason. Graphic violence, rape and language is used liberally. It packs as big a punch with adult material is it does with it's message. On the last note, Hollywood once agian takes its stabs at Republicans (although Vinyard is right winged Naxi, he has very educated political opinions), dissapointing me, the \\"close minded conservative\\". Regardless, History X is a great film that derserves to be viewed.  9.5
0937381888|5.0|I am relatively new to Home brewing, only third batch, but have read several books already.  By far this is the book to get to bring you from novice to advanced brewer.  It will go through step by step in easy to understand language how to brew some good beer.  In later chapters you learn too much to apply immediately to your next batch of beer but not long after that information becomes invaluable as you come full circle in the brewing process.  i consider this the most valuable piece of brewing equipment that I have bought to date.    Prost! Happy Homebrewing!
0810982862|5.0|This is a wonderful book, filled with beautiful art related to James Cameron's film, \\"Avatar\\". While I highly recommend it, potential buyers should be sure they understand what it is and, more importantly, what it is not. The Art of Avatar is a great book with many spectacular images. If you found yourself wanting to pause some scenes while in the theater so that you could study and better appreciate the stunning beauty of Pandora, then this is a book you will love. You can linger on each page as long as you wish.<br /><br />But understand, this is not a dense, fact-filled study of the making of Avatar. It is not an in-depth analysis of the CGI wizardry or 3D magic that Cameron brought to the screen. The Art of Avatar is filled with just that--art--not profiles of the stars or endless ancedotes about who played the most practical jokes during production. This book is primarly about vision. That said, there is a surprising amount of interesting information squeezed in between the art. The brief comments from creature designers and set designers are enlightening. Jon Landau and Peter Jackson provide great comments as well.<br /><br />If you are looking for a book that is a visual treat and glows like the film, then The Art of Avatar is sure to satisfy.<br /><br />See my photos from the book above (\\"Customer Images\\")<br /><br />--Guy P. Harrison, author of:<br /><br />Race and Reality<br /><br />and<br /><br />50 Reasons People Give for Believing in a God
0385504225|3.0|Many of the reviews really go on and on.  If Brown is such a bad writer than why don't some of these \\"critics\\" try to write a novel? They nearly have in writing a review, you would think they get paid by the word!<br /><br />The Lost Symbol is not as good as Da Vinci Code, why? is something every one needs to find out for them selves.<br /><br />I feel that Robert is not as smart in the Lost Symbol, the story does not move as fast.  I do feel that Dan Brown puts a lot of research into the books he writes. The science of Noetics, I've not heard of, I may do my own research or not, does it have bearing on the plot, maybe not but the lady needed to be researching something, right?  Why not pick a area that not many have heard of?<br /><br />Anyway if you like Dan Browns books you will read it, you already have I'm sure.  If you did not read Da Vinci Code, don't bother with this one.
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|Our Representatives need to see this movie. Our country is like ancient Rome. Rome is burning and we don't know how to put out the fire. Our country can't find the money to change our health care system at home, but we can find money for other countries. We send our jobs to other counties, but we are the comsumers of the same products we sent out.  The next movie should be \\"Congress the big sicko or Rome is burning\\".
1594488843|5.0|One of the most helpful things that I took from this book is the varying value of rewards.  I had noticed that bribing my son for even little things led to some less than desirable long-term results; I loved reading the research to back it up.<br /><br />One measure of a powerful book is whether it leads to action. I just ordered a second copy for my son's middle school faculty library.  It's my personal mission now to encourage them to include free-style learning/creating days in the curriculum.  It's a pretty conservative school so I'll have my work cut out for me. Thanks for providing the inspiration, Dan!
B001P9EQH8|4.0|I give this little amp 4 stars -- I bought it for use with my iPod Nano 5g and Sennheiser HD600 headphones.  The built-in amp in the iPod is **just** a bit inadequate to drive these headphones well -- on some albums I needed to crank the volume up all the way, and sometimes that still didn't give me enough volume.    For $20 plus shipping, I figured I'd give the FiiO a try.  If it didn't work, just return it, right?  So it came today, and I gave it a try with some of the problematic tracks on my iPod.  First reactions:  enough volume boost (barely, but enough) to make the problem tracks listenable, and to drive the HD600's to more than comfortable levels on most music. I have the volume on the E5 turned up all the way, and use the touch-wheel on the iPod for volume control.    Second, despite some other reviews here and elsewhere, there is NO discernable hiss or noise from the FiiO E5, either idle or with music playing.      Third:  Bass boost works as advertised.  If you have phones that don't give you good bass response, this will probably fix your problem.  The HD600's have great low-end, so I'm running the E5 set to the OFF position.    Summary:  well worth the money, and worth a try if your music player is working too hard to drive your particular headphones, or if you need the bass boost.  I detect no degredation of the sound with my iPod.  Just for fun, I hooked it up in series with my Home Headroom amp, to see if I could hear a difference...yep, the E5 blurs the extraordinarily good sound from the Headroom just a bit.  But, then, that's not what it's for, is it?  It's NOT a high-end, multi-$$$ amp, just a way to get a bit more performance from your portable music player.  For that, it works just fine!  The only alternatives would be a CMOY amp from one of the builders on eBay, at two to 3 times the price, or a commercial amp at much greater cost.  The E5 is good value for the money, in my book.    - 1/2 star for the flimsy interconnect cables, - 1/2 star fornot having a bit more gain.  However, overall, I'm very satisfied.  Build quality looks fine.  The battery even came charged!     Happy listening!
B002XMGGK6|5.0|First off don't be fooled by the negative reviews of people who wouldn't know a good suspense thriller if it fell out of the sky and landed on there face. This movie is suspenseful, offending, and brilliant in lots of ways. The justice system is very corrupt and definitely has a lot of flaws, is that any reason for someone to become a terrorist, well certainly not. The movie however does touch on some good points as Gerald Butlers character speaks out against a judge claiming, i'm guilty of a crime and you were just about to let me WALK! Not to give anything away but yes this kind of thing happens everyday. Jamie Foxxs character does sympathize at first but as things get more and more out of hand throughout the film he starts to realize he may have made a huge mistake. Gerald Butlers character becomes quite deranged and there is nothing that can be done about it. As far fetched as this seems, the film executes this process very well, even if it seems a bit overkill at times, it never goes beyond slightly plausible. The performances are great, and i especially like Gerald Butlers part since you really don't see him in a lot, but he goes toe to toe very well with Jamie Foxx. Also throughout the movie you can't help but think how Hugh Jackman would have played this role, since Butlers gruff, rugged, mumbled talking attitude reminds your a lot of him. At times you may forget and think thats who it is. So with all the explosions, deaths, and overall bleak atmosphere or the film, i think its dark gritty nature is just what we needed in films today. Thats all i'll say for now, but believe me it is a very very good movie, and never lets up from beginning to end.    NOTE:How far would you go if someone killed your family? And you had the chance?
0156027321|4.0|I have really been enjoying this book. Somehow, I feel comforted while reading about this poor boy's treacherous journey through life and death trials. It was a slow start, but really got going about a third of the way in. And now, I'm enthralled. There is a wisdom and solace that speaks to you while reading. If you're at all interested in the animal wildlife kingdom, then this is definitely for you.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|In case you haven't seen the more revealing trailers, Avatar's story falls in the family of films like Pocahontas or Tarzan - the clash of two disparate worlds. A human company has arrived at Pandora to mine for a very valuable rock, but there's a village of natives, the Na'vi, who are sitting on a large deposit of this rock. Sam Worthington's character is part of the Avatar program, in which a human's being can be transferred to a genetically engineered Na'vi version of himself, to try to learn from the Na'vi and find a way to get this village to move. I know that sounds like I just spoiled the whole movie for you, but that all probably happened in the first 20 minutes. It's literally nearly 3 hours long, so a lot happens in it. I'd say 4 major acts, in all.<br /><br />There are some movies that you can look at over the history of film making and know that they are classics for one reason or another. On my short list of classics would be Chinatown, The Godfather, The Matrix, Star Wars: A New Hope, and Raiders of the Lost Ark. You can say what you will about them, but they're definitely classics. If I had an honorable mentions list it'd probably include Harry Potter and Lord of the Rings, but neither of those series' starting movie was as important as the movies I just listed (which is obviously not an exhaustive list). I think Avatar is a movie we're going to look back on as a big deal in science fiction films and probably in films, in general.<br /><br />I heard all this hype about the movie but didn't buy any of it because the movie didn't look interesting to me. I was as big a skeptic as they come and insulted that James Cameron claimed a CG movie was an innovation, even if it was 3-D. Both those technologies had already existed, so what was the big deal? Well, he was right: I don't think I've ever been so impressed with computer graphics before in my life. He was able to map his actors/actress's faces to their computer-generated forms to display real emotions. It's phenomenal. I felt more for these characters than many movies I've seen with live action movies. As for being in 3-D - it looks amazing in 3-D. It's no longer that stupid gimmick at your local science museum from when you were little where at special moments you'd put on these gigantic classes to see something silly coming at you. It's not a gimmick at all in this movie, in fact - it's a part of how you experience the movie. It makes everything very palpable to the point that I don't know how I'd react to some scenes if I saw them in 2-D. The idea of depth of field you get in some scenes is very valuable for conveying a lot of information to you without having to spend a lot of time on it or just use camera tricks. To not see this movie in 3-D is a disservice to yourself since seeing it in 2-D will be easy once it's out on home video. Back to just the visuals though: the level of detail in this movie is awe-inspiring. You definitely willfully would forget that the world you're seeing isn't real and that these creatures are just computer generated - they're that realistic. Part of what makes you believe is that when you see scenes that didn't need to be computer generated - the scenes between just humans - they don't look computer generated at all. If you see this movie for nothing else other than to enjoy it as a visual feast then it was well worth the price of admission.<br /><br />When it comes to the acting and writing, you start entering somewhat thorny territory. I enjoyed the story more than I thought it would. It was somewhat formulaic but still epic and engaging. It wasn't as predictable as I thought it would be, and I was still happy with the direction it went in. Some of the writing came off to me as a little kludgy and corny. Strangely, I found myself moved even by a couple of the cornier scenes. The acting by most of the leads was strong, especially Sigourney Weaver, Sam Worthington, and Zoe Saldana. Giovanni Ribisi never made sense to me though andStephen Lang's role as the Colonel felt hollow and stereotypical. I think that's more due to the writing than his portrayal though. I did find myself enjoying Michelle Rodriguez as the same character she always plays, but I have a soft spot for her so I was ok with that. The movie was definitely way too long. I don't know what they could've done about that, but it was quite long. To be honest, I enjoyed it enough that I didn't mind sitting through all of it, but I can see other people losing interest during the slower parts.

There's no reason to not go out and see this movie in 3-D if you're in a place that has it in 3-D. If you do not you will almost certainly regret it.

Even if you don't love it like I did, you will at least appreciate the significance of the technology at play here.

It'll almost certainly come out on Blu-ray in 3-D, possibly the first movie to do so, but unless you're rich I'm guessing that you're not getting a 3-D TV set and this is one of the very few movies where 3-D adds to the experience.

B001CISHU4|3.0|Having absolutely adored With Oden On Our Side, I picked up Fate of Norns, and was not disappointed.  The sheer brutality was a breath of fresh air for me.  Being a fan of progressive rock and bluegrass, among other things, anything that is eclectic seems to work for me.  It was nice having some music where the tune is found in the guitar melodies rather than in the vocals.  Despite the harsh growling throughout, those two albums were no less melodic than your average pop song.    With that in mind, what disappointed me about Twilight of the Thunder God is the relative lack of melody.  The vocals are as intense as ever.  The music is more textured, but it is less melodic.  It has its moments, and it's not a dull listen by any means, but it's hard to listen to Twilight when Oden and Norns are available alternatives.
B000ZHS3E8|5.0|If you're a fan of the Sci-Fi genre then you'll love this movie. It's got everything, a little Horror, and superb cinematography. The movie was executed well, sure it gets \\"spacey\\" at one point or another but overall this movie was a pleasure to watch and made me want to revisit it a number of time!
B002PMV9FG|1.0|This was absolutely the worst HP movie I have seen so far. One does not have to be familiar with the book to see the many flaws of this adaptation - from storytelling right down to acting.  The 'high-school' romance and all the potions and all - it was absolutely ridiculous to focus this much on them. And while Ron Weasley's character has always annoyed me for being one pi55y sourpuss, he got even more on my nerves when he started acting all happy.  Overall, I felt like there was about 30 mins of important material that was poorly presented and explained, and over 1.5 hrs of filler fluff that was painful to watch.  And you'd think Dan Radcliffe would get better with age, acting-wise - he got worse. I laughed throughout pretty much the whole thing, as the entire production is an absolute travesty and cannot be taken seriously. I feel totally suckered into buying the rest of the HP movies, just to complete the collection.
B00005JPAO|5.0|Shortly after the election of Tony Blair (Michael Sheen) to the position of Prime Minister, Princess Diana was killed in a horrific car accident. As the British public clamors for an open memorial for the woman Prime Minister Blair called \\"The People's Princess\\", Queen Elizabeth II (Helen Mirren) chooses to keep everything private, taking her grandsons to Balmoral Castle to help them in their time of loss. Without any word from the royal family though, the British people become angered, and are soon close to calling for the dissolution of the crown.    Princess Diana's death was a very tragic event that led to a sense of lost amongst people the world over. It's no secret that Queen Elizabeth II and Princess Di did not get along, especially when considering the fact that Diana was not quiet about her former husband's, Prince Charles, infidelity among other things and was dating a Muslim. Shortly before Diana's death, Tony Blair was elected to the position of Prime Minister, and while things looked somewhat smooth, no one could have expected the hardships he was about to go through in dealing with what became something of a national crisis. Depicting a situation like this isn't an easy task for film, so how did Stephen Frears do with his movie The Queen?    Amazingly! With a script written by Peter Morgan (Frost/ Nixon, The Damned United, The Last King of Scotland, etc.) which is actually the second in something of a series starring Michael Sheen as Tony Blair, The Queen is not only a look at the inner workings of the British government in a time of crisis, but is also a look at the differences between the branches of government and the way they think. Throughout the movie you see that the Queen and the royal family are very old school, choosing to hide emotion and mourn in private rather than display their feelings to the world. They also don't believe that Diana should be mourned on a public level since she no longer was a member of the royal family. Then you have Tony Blair who wants to move the government in a new direction, and can't believe the way the royal family is handling this: with a lack of warmth in their proceedings. You see Blair trying his best to do what he can for a family that, from the outside, doesn't appear to want to do anything for itself. Working off interviews from unnamed sources within the queen's employ and staffers who worked with Blair, Morgan crafts a script that catches the nuances of the inner workings of the government in this type of situation.    To really bring this out, you really need great acting, and in Michael Sheen as Tony Blair and Helen Mirren as Queen Elizabeth II you completely see the struggles, differences, and even similarities between these two figures. As Queen Elizabeth II, Helen Mirren shows you a woman who is strong and solid in her ways but also worries about her position in the history of the monarchy. Mirren's performance is truly the tour de force of the film, but one also can't count out Michael Sheen's portrayal of Prime Minister Blair. You see Blair as a man trying to lead Britain into a new era, and sees things differently with the monarchy, but still holds the monarchy in high regard. As the people start to turn on the monarchy you see him as a man who is, not trying to tell the monarchy what to do, but trying to help the monarchy through a crisis into a better position in the court of public opinion, and Sheen masterfully embodies this.    Never does the movie take a position as to whether the monarchy is good or bad, outdated or what Britain needs at this time. It doesn't examine Princess Diana's life, or who was at fault in her death. A masterful feat for the director, the movie really just examines the monarchy and the British government in this day and age through this crisis. On top of that, the eye for attention to detail is amazing. You see the difference between the settings where the monarch lives and the lower levels of the government reside, and the images of the country side at Balmoral Castle, and the views of the castle interior are breathtaking. Accomplishing this kind of movie in this day and age is a great achievement.    If you're a fan of films dealing with history, or the inner workings of government, particularly the British government I highly recommend this film. With superb acting, directing, and writing this film shows what any film dealing in this nature of material should really be like.    5/5

B0025X4P24|5.0|What do you get when you combine a little bit of pop, a little bit of latin, a little bit of jazz with a whole lot of soul and passion?  You get the The Real Thing.  There are so many good things to say about this CD, I almost don't know where to start.  Vanessa Williams oozed just the right amount of sexiness and sultriness throughout the entire album.  On several selections, I felt like I was watching her in a small intimate night club or dancing and singing away on stage in the more up tempo songs.  The musical arrangements and instrumentation were first class.  From a technical perspective, the CD sounded well suggesting quality production and the songs transitioned well; a real nice ebb and flow from the first song to the last.  I have listened to this CD several times already, and I can honestly say I never felt the inclination to skip to the next song.  Of course there are some songs I like better than others but each song seems to have that ability to grab and hold onto you.  This is the first Vanessa Williams' album I have purchased and I hope it won't be the last.  I have not heard any of her previous recordings but with this album, she has set the bar very high for herself.  I highly recommend this album.

0316069906|5.0|I'm not, nor ever have been a vegetarian. I'm not a huge meat eater, but when I have meat, it's usually chicken. So imagine my dismay when I finished this book, as I found myself standing at the grocery store, staring at pounds of packaged birds, and thought, 'How can I truly eat this again with what I know?\\"  And frankly, if that's a goal on any level for Foer, he succeeded. I think this is one of those books that needs to be bought, and shared , and talked about, and shared again. There's too much the public is either ignorant about regarding the meat industry, or they simply refuse to acknowledge it because once you know you can't go back. Foers decisions, that stemmed from the birth of his son, are also argument enough for any parent out there. How much do you really know about what you're putting in your childs mouth? If you just read one book this year, and care at all about your health, read this.
B00003CXBK|5.0|I absolutely love this movie. It is definitely on my top 5 movies list, (and I have a very eclectic taste for movies and library, therefore). There's just something about this movie that is very powerful. The meanings are both obvious and yet subtle and complicated. It's much more than a typical man vs. nature scenario, depicting an all too familiar greedy mankind and a seemingly fragile system. I could go on and on about it, but I actually wrote this for a different reason. Whereas this is one of my favorite movies and even those who aren't fond of animations could love this as much as I, I would like to correct something I did wrong. I accidentally left the wrong feedback for Media Geek and now Amazon won't let me redo it. Therefore I am attempting to make amends here!    I suggest that you watch this movie. If you are here to purchase it, may I also suggest that you buy it from Media Geek. They not only offer a fair price, but their customer service goes above and beyond anything I have experienced in all my years and years and years as a consumer. I am a very honest person and mean what I say.    So, step 1. Buy Princess Mononoke! Or at least watch it!    Step 2. Buy it from Media Geek!    The end. Thanks for reading!

B002Q1YDLI|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed the first novel in this series.  So much so, in fact, that the very moment I'd finished it i was on my way to the bookstore to pick up this one.  I love that it picks up the moment the other book leaves off. But perhaps the most compelling aspect of Something Blue is the way it is narrated in the voice of a different character from the first book.  Darcy was not the most sympathetic character in Something Borrowed, and when, a few chapters in you find yourself actually pullimg for her, you learn a thing or two about forgiveness, redemption, and how there just might be some good in everybody.  At the very least you see the value of remembering that there are two sides to every story, and neither everything nor everybody is ever as simple as they may seem at first glance.  Great, different follow-up to Something Borrowed.  Hoping for more to come from this talented author.
B001TOD92C|5.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie's plot.  The Wrestler is a movie about Randy 'The Ram' Robinson (Mickey Rourke) who was once wrestling's biggest superstars but now his stardom and his career are fading along with his personal relationship with his daughter Stephanie (Evan Rachel Wood) and a stripper Pam who also has a stage name Cassidy (Marisa Tomei), even worse is his fleeting popularity with the fans. The movie is shot in a somewhat documentary style and compliments the directors vision of in your face realism.     I went to see this movie when it first hit my local theater and I must admit that I am a huge wrestling fan. I grew up watching the likes of Hulk Hogan, Ric Flair and many wrestling greats. I was eagerly anticipating the behind the scenes action and it delivered. Not only does this movie pay homage to the wrestling superstars of today it also reminds us to never forget about the superstars of yesterday, whose names are not currently up in lights. There is considerably enough humor, emotion and complexity in Randy, s personal life to keep a non fan sated but its unbelievable ability to touch a fan is most profound and it succeeds with flying colors.     In my opinion 'The Rams' relationship with the fans are much more complex than Randy's personal relationships. This is best demonstrated as 'The Ram' is seen greeting and acknowledging two disabled fan's just outside the door to ring side. Here are two fans that probably know all that there is to know about 'The Ram' but perhaps know very little about Randy. I personally doubt that they would want to know either; you see, wrestling is about making heroes and villains, it shows us the beauty of love, the ugliness of hate and gives us fans a proper outlet to appropriately express it. This movie made me laugh and cry. I laughed the most at scenes of Randy's day job where at a deli he tries to use humor to get him through the day and again in a later scene where Randy's stagename 'The Ram' suddenly takes on a whole new meaning. I really enjoyed those scenes.     I choked up a few times, in particular the part where Randy is seen playing Nintendo with a little boy who isn't interested (not really) in hearing stories about The Ram. To me this was sad because back in the early 80's wrestlers were devoid of proper media marketing such as Internet, Dud's, Cd's, etc... not to mention the lack of popularity wrestling  had with the mainstream. (Note: The fact that the business held onto the idea that wrestling was absolutely real added to this. It wasn't until after a superstar 'open hand slapped a 20/20 news reporter (twice) who asked him if wrestling was fake, that WWE admitted, \\"Although the story lines are fixed the matches were absolutely real\\". That is what launched it into the mainstream.)     Reinforcing this is a later scene in which, you see former superstars at a fan signing resting their heads on tables while another is actually sewing. The young fans don't care about them anymore, they are left with a disregard that I'm sure was tougher for them to live with than the injuries that they had endured.  It hurts me so deeply that people consistently mock and make fun of the die-hard passion between the wrestlers and the fans that I got more emotional while writing this review than I care to admit. I have witnessed more compassion and love from the men and women in this business then I have seen from those in any other popular sport.     As far as WWE superstar appearances, there are plenty, but most important to me was a cameo appearance by WWE newcomer R-Truth. Where he asks Randy \\"So how you been man?\\" Randy answers \\"Hangin and swangin' my brotha.\\" that is priceless topped off with R-Truth saying\\" I'm buyin.'\\" is something only a fan can truly appreciate and it brings a smile to my face every time. It upsets me to know the sacrifice and undying commitment these superstars give to the fans night after night and for some (superstars and fans alike) that is the only family they have left. This movie will   pick you up and slam you down, again and again.     At the heart of this emotional roller coaster is a 'Rocky' like tribute. While Randy is talking on a pay phone we hear him say \\"I don't give an s--- I just want to wrestle.\\" This is a really good movie for Fans and Non fans alike and although as a fan I wanted to stand up and cheer I couldn't because I was too floored to move.  I walked away with a feeling that although the sport might be staged, maybe just once because of this movie, everyone can appreciate just what wrestling entertainment is really all about.
B002QEXN2K|5.0|Reviewers on here are way way too harsh, like they could even begin to make an album...    John and crew have done an amazing Job here. I don't even know why people compare it to previous albums. What   is the point? How can you expect an artist to make the same album over and over?     This album is a completely natural continuation of John's growth as a musician/artist.     And do you really need to comment on his love life? Perhaps the only reason those BS tabloids are flooding every shopping isle is because people buy them. So stop buying them and worry about your own love life!

B002KQ6BT6|5.0|Having read all of Mr. Brown's books, I have to say, I waited impatiently for this one to arrive.  I was not let down.  I believe Mr. Brown does for literature what Star Wars did for cinema. Where the actual story Good vs. Evil, boy and girl, whatever (now that's good English) is fairly simple, however Mr. Brown is able to interject history, background and theory that said in other forums would be dry and boring.  I never had an interest in the Masons, or Washington D.C. until reading the book.  I am fascinated now, and will be planning a trip.  The argument over previous novels is bull (again, good English) and only opened the door for lively debate among intelligent people.  It strengthened my faith by an increase in knowledge of theories and history.  As as Novel and loosely based on theories and innuendo, all of Mr. Brown's books have been very enjoyable reads.  I look forward to the next one.
0061730327|2.0|William Kamkwamba has an amazing story of perseverance, brilliant innovation, and overcoming the odds.  This should be a story about William's character.  Sadly, it's more about conditions in Africa and how the international community SOMETIMES picks a winner to lift up and commend.<br /><br />This book does William Kamkwamba a disservice.  \\"The Boy Who Harnessed the Wind\\" makes this young man's story ... well, almost an afterthought.<br /><br />To begin the book, Bryan Mealer treats the reader to 156 pages of the situation on the ground.  Drought, famine, witchcraft, cholera, unimaginable suffering, poverty, governmental incompetence.  This takes up more than half the book, and other than providing the motivation for William's inventiveness, it seems to be merely a way to showcase Bryan Mealer's descriptive talents.  Got it, Mr. Mealer -- you're doing a great job as a writer.  Tell me about WILLIAM.<br /><br />When the book finally begins to describe the principles of electricity and wind power that William discovered through extensive reading (in a foreign language, from library books) and trial-and-error, the story becomes gripping.  What William did, and how his invention transformed his life, is awe-inspiring.  William never became resentful of his circumstances or depressed because of overwhelming odds.  Day by day, he searched the junkyard, and he had lucky breaks that led to his providing electric lights for his room, his house, and his village.<br /><br />William Kamkwamba had an ultimate goal of using wind to power an irrigation pump, so his family could make two harvests a year instead of one.  But before we get to read that part of the story (which would have been interesting), we have to read about the story of William being discovered by the media.  Suddenly, blessings begin to flow to him -- schooling, equipment, solar panels, help, attention, speaking gigs.  Outside sponsorship and international aid smooths his way to greatness.  There's plenty of information on William's benefactors -- again... that doesn't seem like it should be the important part of the story.<br /><br />All in all, there's only about 100 pages of the story of HOW William did what he did -- the good part.<br /><br />The writing style is good, but the book is not very satisfying on the science or the central figure.rs -- again... that doesn't seem like it should be the important part of the story.

I found the author totally lacking in any spiritual enlightenment. I did not learn anything and was not brought to any higher enlightenment by her book.<br />In fact, the contrary...<br />I have a person in my life that was abused by her first husband then went immediately into another relationship with another abuser. Two years ago she was diagnosed with lung cancer (never smoked a day in her life) which metastasized to he brain then her bladder. In this time she lost her job and had to declare bankruptcy. Her life is a daily struggle and  her future uncertain. She is 39.<br />If I want to glean spiritual enlightenment about a life journey I want to read something from someone who has actually gone through tough times. I don't want to read about someone who had an all-expense paid trip to three different countries after going through nothing more than a divorce. (She did not even have kids to make it complicated.)<br />My advice is to pass on this book.

1416594787|5.0|With the 150 year anniversary of the Origin of Species, we have been deeply rewarded with a couple of first class books in defense of the biological sciences of which Darwin's elegant theory forms the foundation of those sciences.  It is unfortunate that books of these types are needed, as excellent authors such as Futuyma and Pennock have provided excellent books in the past that convincingly detailed the evidence for evolution.  However, to those of us who find biology interesting at a novice's level, we get to be rewarded as excellent writing scientists such as Richard Dawkins and Jerry Coyne grace us with interesting and passionate expositions of the evidence for evolution and the profound power it has in explaining so much of the natural world in which we live.<br /><br />Dawkins starts off comparing deniers of evolution to hypothetical deniers of ancient roman society or to the less hypothetical deniers of the holocaust.  Dawkins points out that those who deny evidence do so for ideological reasons and are unlikely to be swayed by his book.  It is the author's intent to give enough ammunition to those not snared by superstitious and/or nonsensical ideologies that they can confidently oppose such ideas in the public contest for the hearts and minds of the public as a whole.<br /><br />Like Darwin, Dawkins starts with a lot of evidence from the world of artificial selection to show what can be done through different selection pressures within the gene pool and does a good job of connecting artificial selection to natural selection and explaining what selective pressures occur in the natural world from both \\"natural selection\\" and its subset \\"sexual selection.\\"<br /><br />Likening it to uncovering a crime, Dawkins goes through the evidence bit by bit and shows that the evidence is overwhelming except to those who have been blinded by dogma or disinterest. Dawkins gives some great examples to show how Darwin's theory has been used to direct new findings in the study of genetics, paleontology, geology, etc.  Such examples as bipedal African apes, or four limbed \\"Titkaalik\\" fish, show the power of understanding Darwin's theory, and how you can look for evidence and find exactly what you hypothesized you would find.<br /><br />For those of us who already accept the reality of evolution, the book provides additional interesting insights that Dawkins' previous books such as \\"The Selfish Gene\\" and \\"The Ancestor's Tale\\" got our minds salivating for.  Though it is unfortunate that a defense of Darwin's elegant theory is necessary in a world where tribal bronze-age dogmas die hard, for those of us enamored by the incredible wonder and beauty of the natural world, such a defense is deeply rewarding  and awe-inspiring.ontology, geology, etc.  Such examples as bipedal African apes, or four limbed \\"Titkaalik\\" fish, show the power of understanding Darwin's theory, and how you can look for evidence and find exactly what you hypothesized you would find.

1400063736|4.0|I wasn't 100% sure I'd really enjoy this book before I started. It seemed like a book I should read (especially after I saw it appear on a few \\"Best of 2009\\" lists), but I wasn't sure it was one I wanted to read. I finally got around to it while I was stuck on a plane with nothing better to do, and it surprised me.<br /><br />The book is almost like a series of short stories, but the overlapping characters and plot lines pull it together to form a cohesive novel. Two of my all time favorite novels ([[ASIN:0375507256 Cloud Atlas: A Novel]] and [[ASIN:0375724508 Ghostwritten]]) use a similar technique, so I couldn't help but compare it to them. When I read those books, I found them very compelling; I always wanted to jump into the next section to see what would happen and how the stories would connect. For some reason, though, this book did not have quite the same affect on me. I enjoyed the book, but I rarely felt a strong pull to pick it up again after setting it down.<br /><br />Although I didn't find it compelling as my two favorite novels, I did still enjoy reading it. I really liked the way McCann took several simple stories and developed them by connecting them to one another and illuminating multiple perspectives. There were several times when the novel surprised me by returning to another story or character and totally changed my understanding of it by offering a new perspective (while keeping it consistent with the original story).<br /><br />My biggest criticism is with the final chapter. Most of the novel takes place in 1974, but the last chapter jumps ahead to 2005. I found McCann's portrait of NYC in 1974 fascinating, but his return to the near-present was jarring for me. He seemed determined to include every possible contemporary theme (post 9/11 airport security, Iraq/Afghanistan, carbon footprint, etc.) in order to make his novel relevant. But since he didn't have time to deal with each issue in just one chapter, he just mentioned each briefly and moved on. That being said, I did enjoy the storyline of the final chapter and seeing what had happened to the character(s) included.<br /><br />Overall, it's definitely a novel that I'd recommend to a friend who enjoys reading. The artful use of multiple perspectives made for very interesting character development that really enhanced the novel.I did enjoy the storyline of the final chapter and seeing what had happened to the character(s) included.

0385532458|5.0|I have read most of Grisham's books.  He has an interesting place in my literary file - an enjoyable summertime read on the beach versus some of the most thought provoking character studies.  This collection of short stories is extraordinary.  He takes ordinary people, places them in circumstances of life, and then drives the story by letting the characters evolve and interact with each other.  It is like watching an intense play in a very intimate theatre setting.  The resolution of the story may  at times be a logical conclusion, but more often than not, it continues as a spectrum of life.  I listened to the audio version, read by Grisham himself - what a great experience!  Igor Dumbadze

So this movie stars Brandon Lee as Eric Draven/The Crow Ernie Hudson as Officer Albercht Micheal Wincott as Top Dollar, Rochell Davis in her only role as Sarah. The story is somewhat simple on October 30th Devils Night Eric Draven & his fiancée Shelly Webster are murdered by members of Top Dollar's crime syndicate so a year later Eric has come back for revenge to put the wrong things right. Give or take a few things it's an almost perfect movie. This screams 90's the soundtrack is great when you got The Cure, some S.T.P NINE INCH NAILS, Rage Against The Machine, some Rollins, freakin' Pantera you win. Greame Revell's score was excellent. Sarah could be annoying but she really did have character you cared about she screamied what the mid 90's were about. Ernie Hudson was good. Micheal Wincott was solid.
0802136834|5.0|I have loved every book by Weir that I've read.  She's an excellent author who doesn't stray from the facts and keeps the content clean.
B002VKE1K2|1.0|Half an hour into this movie we wanted to turn it off.  We decided to keep watching because of all of the hype.  Hoping that it would get better.  At an hour, I asked my boyfriend if he wanted to turn it off (hoping he would).  We decided to keep watching because something had to happen right?  No one would make a movie so boring without something really good happening at some point.  Well, finally in the last five minutes something happens.  Not much, but something. The best comparison I can make is it's like an hour and a half episode of Ghost Hunters except it's fake, so the few little supernatural incidents are not the least bit scary becuase we know it's fake.  If it were real, it might have made a good Ghost Hunters episode.  Shame on the person who compared it to a Hitchcock film.
B002SJIO5E|3.0|I had high hopes for this film. The combination of political intrigue, poignant views on racism, questions of \\"un\\"-human rights, the science fiction genre (specifically about aliens), and spot on specially effects, should have made this a 5 star reveiw. The fact is, it just missed on all of these points. The set up is great, but the plot is lacking. The acting was also sub-par, save for Sharlto Copley, who I thought did a decent job.    I liked the mocumentary style, and I really liked the cable feeds in the beginning.    This may have been a 4 star review if I did't have such high expectaions going into the film.
B000IMVMFM|5.0|Back to my review It's a shame Brandon Lee had to die he did work work with Dolph Lundgren in a film called Show Down in Little Tokyo & some other action movies this movie would have put him in a league with Arnie & Sly. It's 1 of the last over the top action flicks. I can't believe there remaking this movie G*d D**n since when did we start remaking movies from the mid 90's.
B001AVCFJM|5.0|I was never a Star Trek fan, but my wife has always been. When this came out, it was the first Trek movie I wanted to see and the first Trek movie she didn't want to see. She was worried they would screw it up. We finally saw it and I loved it! It actually got me interested to see the rest of the movies so I got her the original 6 movies for Christmas, all which I have now watched, and I will soon get the next 4 Next Generation movies. She was very upset for awhile at certain things that didn't immediately make sense, like Kirk's father getting killed so early in his life, Vulcan getting destroyed, etc. and it seems a lot of other Trek fans disapprove for similar reasons. It actually makes perfect sense; as the time-travel alternate-universe plot-twist revealed itself, I explained to her that this movie is not actually a prequel, but actually yet another SEQUEL about Spock's fate when he grows old. The prequel aspect is really just a fun and much more interesting way to package the movie than to show Spock get thrown back in time and be stuck on a frozen planet for umpteen years until the Romulan Nero is able to force him to watch helplessly as he takes his revenge by destroying Spock's home planet. My wife had been upset that this movie seemed to \\"reset\\" or \\"nullify\\" the original episodes and movies with its alternate-universe events, but once she realized and understood that it is a sequel, she really liked it. The only things I don't like is the Spock/Uhura romance thing which seems totally unnecessary, and the actor for Chekov doesn't look anything like Chekov, although he sounds just like him.
B002IVLH60|5.0|I've owned every PJ album since they debuted and many bootlegs, live albums, etc. This is without a doubt the best PJ album in at least 10 years based on just my first time listening. And it might be one of the best ever. I won't take the time to describe each song as I have yet to identify my favorites, I've really liked them all. A little more melodic than some previous albums, although some songs are simplistic really but hauntingly memorable. But go buy it at Target, this import price is too much and they have it for much less there.
B000002A3T|4.0|Well here it is.... 2010.... and as I finish watching David Gilmour: Remember That Night: Live at the Royal Albert Hall on Blu Ray I have to reflect upon the Divisional Bell. With the recent death of Richard Wright we see a final chapter to Pink Floyd. For me I have always believed that like many groups that broke up, the sum of the parts are greater than the individual members. Pink Floyd was no different. No one can argue the talents of Roger Waters. But looking back all these years since and listening to the works of both sides I have to say that the Pink Floyd legacy survived with David Gilmour. I have been patiently waiting for Waters to somehow emerge out of his state of anger and conceit to create something worthy of his talent. On the other hand, years later and I still find myself loving 'Divisional Bell'. Gilmour has stated that much of the contents were not about the relationship between Waters and the band but one only has to listen to the words to know that is understated. Rogers has his \\"Wall\\" and this is Gilmour's \\"wall\\" that has him expressing his feelings. Holds up well IMHO and I find myself pulling it out to play again and again.
B001AEF6C2|5.0|Great Movie, Dvd, or Film. That has a very sexy looking women in it. ( Kelly Lebroc)  Anthony michel Hall also does a great job of acting in this film.
0316044407|1.0|I got this book as a gift and the person who gave it to me used the word\\" hideous\\" to describe it and asked me to tell her my thoughts.    Well, plain simple, this is an awful awful book! I could not even finish the book because it was dragging and 150 pages in, it just did not go anywhere. As much as I feel sorry for what happened to Susie, she is just a boring character!!!!    I wound up skipped about 100 pages(and apparently I did not miss out much) and started glancing through the tedious paragraphs and when I got to the part of Susie(in Ruth's body) seducing Ray, I just could not take it anymore. You are raped and killed and instead of spending time with your family(while you have a chance to communicate with humans), the first and only thing you want to do is to have sex?!!!!    A very pretentious and amateur read. If you dont have anything better to do, still do not give it a try.
B001UV4XUG|5.0|At first I was not that into this movie. The sequencing of various memories out of order was mildly annoying, and it just wasn't catching my interest that much, and Joseph Gordon-Levitt did not seem to fit the role I *thought* he was playing...<br /><br />However gradually it all began to mesh for me and by the end - and after the movie was over - I have decided that I liked it very much. I don't know that it would be for everyone, even those who like indie films, but as for me I really enjoyed it. It has been a couple of days since I saw it, and the afterthoughts linger nicely as very good films tend to do. It affected me, and connected with me through relationships from my own past. I've had my Days of Summer too.<br /><br />(500) Days of Summer explores a relationship, concepts about love and romance, the difference between fantasy and reality between friends and lovers, and of course the notion of unrequited love. The acting is very good, there are a lot of little coherent details and interesting scenes that add up to a rich film, and the story is universal. The climax is very poignant and intense, and so much went unsaid, which is a nice quality in a film. Shortly thereafter the end of the movie can't help but make you smile - though whether you are smiling due to humor, pain, happiness, or something else is up in the air.
B0026P3G12|5.0|I was amazed when I first saw/heard her on the British talent show.  I am amazed at her 2009.  I am completely satisfied with this CD ... I play it over and over and four of the songs are just OUTSTANDING and I love listening to her sing them.
B000I5XOVY|3.0|3.4 stars<br /><br />A technically well-made action flick with occasional very interesting lines, Swordfish also gets way above its head in many areas.<br /><br />I liked Travolta and Jackman well enough, and Berry is better than the normal starlet in these sorts of summer blockbuster movies (backhanded praise, of course). There were moments here that I really enjoyed, but they always seemed offset by some form of silliness that ratcheted everything else down a notch, like the hacking/bj scene. There's also zero sense of reality (the DOD mainframe gets hacked and they don't immediately track the ISP?), but I doubt that was the goal here.<br /><br />The ending is laughable; watch the two deleted endings in the extras and listen to the director's commentary. He claims they added the [spoiler alert] bit about blowing up the terrorists to show that Travolta's character \\"is a patriot\\". Yeah, some patriot: he kills dozens of innocent bystanders to \\"save our American way of life\\". This is presented as some sort of rationale, incredibly. Look, boys, stick to the slam-bang action and leave the self-glorifying justifications for murder and torture to scumsacks like Dick Cheney. Saving our \\"way of life\\"! If paying ten bucks to go watch weirdly violent semi-nationalistic weirdness like this is our way of life, I'd say it might be time to get a new life.
B000OT8GCQ|3.0|Nicholas Sparks is an amazing author, but his last few books have been all the same. I had to force myself to get through Dear John. The relationship between John and Savannah was boring- I thought the only redeeming quality of this book was the progression of the relationship between John and his father, which was very touching.
B002Q4U9YU|1.0|Some would have you believe this is a powerfully potent epic with a penetrating message for today's youngsters, but no \\"State of Shock?!\\"  No \\"Say Say Say?!\\"  This MUST be a joke!
B002BWQ6H6|4.0|Here is some superb and sublime writing. I found the first few chapters almost hypnotic in style, tone and substance. I was drawn right in.    It's a wonderfully crafted, structured and woven piece...however, the unrelenting and often puzzling introduction of new voices distracts and eventually dilutes the novel as a whole. The threads between them become more tenuous, the voices less real...and then there's a leap forward in time and space that breaks the thread entirely.     Still very much worth reading. But a pity: a more focused edit could have elevated the novel to another level.
B000002KOO|5.0|This album is in my all-time top ten.<br />Vintage Mac, flying at its highest. With this recording, they moved away from the somewhat confining and very derivative straight blues vein, and into some very new and adventurous territory. Peter Green--Peter the Great--demonstrated that he was ready to expand his horizons, and we are lucky for it. Absolutely magnificent singing and songwriting by Pete and Danny Kirwan, and superbly creative and powerful rhythm, as usual, from Mick Fleetwood and John McVie. And the guitar playing? Words cannot do it justice. Green confirms his reputation as one of the most expressive, tasteful, and technically great players of all time.<br />I'm the same age as Peter Green, and I bought this LP when it first came out back in the late sixties. I loved it then, and I love it now. The tunes all hold up extremely well. The full-length version of Oh Well is a song for the ages, a masterpiece of the highest order.<br /><br />The photo of the band gives me a wistful, bittersweet feeling. On the original LP of course, the photo was reproduced inside the cover at full size, and so you could see more detail. I think I once did a drawing of that photo, mainly because I was so enamored of the music and the band. We were all in our late teens or early twenties, so young, so fit, so strong, full of possibilities, and it was a different world. The guys in the group looked happy and carefree, oblivious to what was to come. I hate drugs, and what they did to Peter Green, how they ravaged him mentally and physically, and robbed him of the stupendous skills he once possessed, which were never higher than on this record. But then again, Peter is still with us, still playing, still touring, and so, even though he is a shadow of what he once was, we can be thankful, and raise a glass to him.<br /><br />Life takes a toll on all of us, and some of us pay dearly.
0312360258|5.0|I am a huge fan of Twilight, despite some lack of actual writing technique.  One of my Twilight buddies recommended this series to me. I am so glad she did!  Zoey lives in a society where vampires are a known fact and scientifically studies.  She becomes Marked and has to go to the \\"House of Night\\", the fledgling vamp school in order to survive.  Zoey has been given special powers by the goddess and now how to try to fit in.  She makes some new friends, attends two different full moon rituals with candles and the calling of the elements Water, Fire, Earth, Air and Spirit.  Her human ex-almost-boyfriend causes her all sorts of problems.  She makes some powerful enemies and does a bit of blood drinking along the way.  This is a great story of a struggling teen trying to fit in and do whats right.  The hero is the classic thrown into a new world with extraordinary power, but that is where the similarities end.
0060775858|5.0|There is a reason this book is such a classic. This gentle story offers many opportunities for learning and interacting with your child about everything happening in the story.  A must for any child's library.
0312370849|5.0|I have always been drawn to books on the Holocaust.  The history of this event has never been recorded as I thought it should.    \\"This book will stay on your mind long after it's back on the shelf.\\" -Risa Miller, author of Welcome to Heavenly Heights  This review is completely true.  I had never known of this event which took place in France and could not put this book down.  I had to keep reading to see what was going to happen next.  At first I wasn't sure I was going to like the chapters going from 1942 to 2002, but after the first two, I understood why and that is what had me after each chapter.  The ending was also not what I would have expected and I would even wonder now if this was a true story what happened after the last chapter.    Loved the book, would definitely recommend it to anyone.
B00127RAJY|4.0|Love it!!  especially since it was in 3 segments, I could sneak in a workout while the baby was asleep. Def tough but not imposible, I was kinda out of shape before trying this video so it was rough but I did it and it was great!! Especially level 3, so don't be afraid by other rec. saying its not for begginers just give it a try and stick to it and you will see a difference!
B002M2T1UO|5.0|This series was awsome. From the moment you watch the Pilot to the final episode it keeps you guessing and on edge. A great cop show and has enough comedy to make you smile. Many people have complained about the booklet it comes in. My Disks were great, not a scratch on them and slide in and out fine. Perhaps they fixed this from earlier models.
0689853491|5.0|This story is so much fun to read aloud.  It is interactive and gives a parent lots of chances to be expressive and act out the various scenes.  My daughter will bring this book up to us and hold it out asking us to read it.  It is long but a blast for the reader and child.
0060763280|3.0|Like many of the other reviews state, this book is mostly pep talk and promotion for his Millionaire Mind Intensive Seminar.  Having never attended the seminar, I can only rate the book, which is just decent.  There are certainly some useful ideas and some positive mind-sets if you want to become wealthy, but there is nothing in the way of practical advice for how to take action other than attending his seminar.
0316017922|3.0|To be sure, I greatly enjoy Gladwell's writing style. His books are fun to read. This book Outliers is no exception. It is engaging with ample relevant examples. Even though the basic premise--that success is much more than the result of talent--was nothing new to me, I still read it with great interest. That's a sign of a good writer: engaging readers with something they may already subscribe to.    Having said that, it would have been good if Gladwell had spent some space on spelling out what success means to him. He leaves that assumed. Based on the examples he gives, success is found in health, athletic excellence, academic achievement, professional ability, and entrepreneurial accomplishments. Those are indeed signs of success in North American culture, but therefore, based on Gladwell's own rationale, legacies of our popular culture.     Consequently, Gladwell falls into the same value-trap that Lewis Terman fell into with his massive study on \\"gifted\\" children. Giftedness was based on intellectual prowess--measure of success was based on these kids eventually ending up in professional careers. If a child would end up as a homemaker or a carpenter, that was a disappointment to Terman. Gladwell, by implication, explains this as lack of opportunity or legacy issues holding people back. That may be so, but it could equally well be that those children ended up being content with a job that fit their value-system.    Gladwell's framework of success (or lack thereof) is an oversimplification. People often pursue what they value most. The reality is that many young people gifted in athletics decide not to pursue it. (I have been a high performance coach and have seen this first-hand.) Or a young woman decides to abandon her career as a doctor for the sake of her many adopted children (as a friend of my wife did). Success as implicitly understood by Gladwell (and folks like Terman) is based on some sort of public achievement (academically, athletically, or economically). Success could simply be living with integrity without the economic benefits that come with \\"professional\\" accomplishments. Who is more successful, a person who breaks records and makes hundreds of millions of dollars in the process yet repeatedly cheats his wife and lives totally narcissistically or a \\"no-name\\" man next door with an average income (and status) job, who loves his wife and children and is always ready to help his neighbors out? Watch the movie The Family Man or It's a Wonderful Life, and you may understand what I mean.     Still, Gladwell's book is worth reading. At the very least we will know that life is more than talent. But the book is somewhat of an opportunity to piggyback on the shallow legacy of popular culture.
0446402397|3.0|What a great concept for a crime thriller.  For the first two-thirds of the book, I was very intrigued.  The writing was good, not great.  The detective in Stalinist Russia was a great convention.  Interesting, if not especially deep characters.  Then the most absurd and overly convenient plot point ruined the book for me.  An attempt to wrap the book all up into a neat, tidy package.  Very disappointing -- and intriguing/disappointing like Dan Brown's books are.  A much better book set in Soviet Russia is David Benioff's City of Thieves.
B000W7JWUA|5.0|I only gave a 4 in Durability because if people are rough when putting together the pieces or you let kids under 10 play, they can tear up the cardboard punched board tiles.  This is a great strategy game that is easy to learn but complex to master.  Great for the whole family (10+).
081095415X|5.0|These are the best photographs of animals in the wild in Africa that I have ever seen.They are poetic evocations of the spirit and beauty of some of the last vestiges of wildlife in the world.  If you are longing to go on safari but can't find a way, this book will transport you.  If you have gone on safari and want a reminder of the wonders  that you have seen this is the book for you,
0375854819|3.0|I am having so much trouble getting through this book. I really like the first book(which was so close to Star Wars remake that it was rather comforting), and the second was pretty good also (more of a Lord of the Rings feel with that one), but this third one is sooooooooooooo loooooooong! There seems to be lecture after lecture for stupid choices that even my 12 year old wouldn't have made. Kill Sloan already!! Put the \\"blessed\\" girl out of her misery why don't you! Teenage girl with large arms?  And now I find out that there is one more book to this series? Are you kidding me? Less than one third of the way through my husband was saying that an abridged version of this book would have been much better, and he is as anti-abridged as you can get.    I was tempted to give this book only two stars because I'm really not liking it, but I felt that three stars better suited because of closure issues that some might have. I think I'll write my own book 4 to be done with it sooner.
B000FA675C|3.0|I don't quite understand the success of this novel: research is sloppy, style so-so, the \\"code-breaking\\" part almost childish. As for research, if the author is too lazy to learn how GPS locators work, describe Louvre's Great Gallery accurately or invest more that one sentence in claim that Dead Sea Scrolls contain New Testament texts, it will somehow make suspension of disbelief harder. OTOH, it in not necessary to repeat twenty times that the Church changed quite radically in its early centuries, that authentic apocryphal (so to say) gospels exist or that religion is not \\"naturally male-dominated\\" (though, judging by the novel's success, it seems to actually be news to many).
1416550542|5.0|I read this book because it was selected by my bookclub, and I am so happy for it.  I read this book while on vacation on the sandy beaches of Mexico and although on vacation, this book transformed me to a different land.  It was so easy to visualize the book due to the writer's fantastic writing and really get deep into the lives of the characters.  It had a little bit of everything, mystery, romance, angst and even some funny points.  It definitely kept you guessing and enthralled until the very end, and when it was completed, I was left with a sigh of \\"ahhhh, what a really nice read\\"!
B002SSBD6W|5.0|This is a great book that everyone should read, especially those who eat meat. It is packed with facts, stats and information that most people have no clue about. I would think that if someone didn't like this book it is because it made them sit up, take notice, and have second thoughts about what they are taking part in. Or they are someone that works with the  meat industry and helps to create all these problems. We vote with our dollars every time we sit down to a meal. This book makes you realize how it is important that you pay attention to who is getting your dollars. Two thumbs way up!
B000AP04OM|5.0|How is Captain Von Trapp not the best father EVER? He's a former Commander in the Austrian Navy (????--lots of lake-based War Games, I suppose) who has of late become a widower raising seven kids in his beloved homeland, now post-Anschluss and overrun with brown-shirted thugs, including an 18-year-old Hitler Youth poster boy named Rolf who's been hitting on his super-hormonal 16-going-on-17-year-old daughter (redundant, I know).<br /><br />Obviously overwhelmed by circumstances and with no-one to confide in but Max, his cliche-spouting music producer friend with Liberace's flamboyance and Michael Jackson's judgment, he winds up making some questionable lifestyle decisions, like dumping his money-honey sexpot Baroness GF in favor of a completely bedroom-untested Salzburg nun with nothing but a guitar, an Ipana smile, and an eerie pre-hip-hop ability to rhyme on the fly. In English. The Nazis, whom he strongly opposes, are pressuring him with some not-so-veiled threats against his family to accept a high-level commission with the Reich he so despises. Escape from an occupied homeland surrounded by forbidding mountains with seven kids and a guitar-lugging wife in tow would seem an iffy long-shot at best, even if you just watched the hapless Jets beat the undefeated Colts a mere hour or so earlier. And yet in the face of all of this, he manages to keep his eye on the prize, pushing his kids to learn a half-dozen or so great R&H tunes, even to the point of making sure that they get those tricky Rodgers harmonies right.<br /><br />You, sir, are a Great Father for the ages.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|I just watched the series and film again over the holidays.  If MASH (which ranked only 46th its first year) had the same network nabobs unwilling to allow that series to find its fan base, it, too, would have been canceled.  Staggering, yes.  That is what FOX did to this brilliant series that fans all over the world love and remain heartsick about to this day.  Not only is it developed by Josh Whedon for pete's sake, but also it has such talented actors and crew that the thing is about as perfect as a series could be. It is often laugh out loud hilarious, other times pulse pounding thrilling and sometimes heartbreaking--but always fascinating.  Check it on IMDB and [...] where it has nearly perfect ratings as here in Amazon; also take a look at the cast's filmographies. All of the brilliant actors have been busy since the show was canceled, all of them in series/movies right now, including Nathan Fillion's charming Castle. I am so happy for all of them, yet from everything I've read, they, too, wish they had been able to continue Firefly (Whedon planned it for 7 years) and are deeply touched by their fans' love of Firefly. Don't miss the film, Serenity, which Whedon did for his fans who worked so hard for the series--it is also excellent and helps tie a few ends, but it's not enough, no. Canceling Fiefly may very well be the worst blunder in television history.
B000056HE9|5.0|This is my most favorite Christmas movie.  Everytime I watch it I see something new.  The new DVD version has clear images that enhance the viewing experience.  Everyone should have a copy in their Christmas movie collection.
B001PR0YDA|3.0|Robert Zemeckis' new \\"A Christmas Carol\\" story is an animated film using the art of \\"performance capture,\\" where actors' movements are digitally recorded and translated into CGI. So what you will see here is not Jim Carrey himself, but the computer graphic animation of Jim Carrey. Considering his superb performance as Count Olaf in \\"Lemony Snicket's a Series of Unfortunate Events,\\" I think Jim Carrey playing Scrooge in a live-action film would be a better choice, but it seems Mr. Zemeckis didn't think so.     (By the way, I have watched the film in the conventional 2-D format. These 3-D glasses are too much of a distraction for me.)     The classic story of Charles Dickens needs no new introduction. Old miser Scrooge is given a chance to reform his life through the visitation of three ghosts. The basic storyline remains the same in Disney's adaptation, but it seems Robert Zemeckis thought he needed something new to sort of spice up the content.     Besides the aforementioned performance capture and 3-D, Robert Zemeckis-directed \\"A Christmas Carol\\" stars Jim Carrey in multiple roles. That means he plays Scrooge (young and old) as well as the three ghosts. Not only that. Most co-stars play more than one character in Mr. Zemeckis' version. So, (animated) Gary Oldman \\"plays\\" the three roles - Bob Cratchit, Marley and Tiny Tim. But what is the point of doing this?     The tone of the film is also pretty different at times, compared with other versions. As some reviewers have pointed out, some scenes (especially the entrance of Marley's ghost) will be scary for kids and, perhaps, even for adults. The second half of the film contains a rather lengthy \\"chase\\" scene of the mouse-sized Scrooge. But do we really need this?     Obviously Robert Zemeckis, whose recent works include \\"The Polar Express\\" and \\"Beowulf,\\" thinks the cinema's future lies in the advanced visual technologies. Whether he is right or not is yet to see, but for those who still remember Mr. Zemeckis as the creator of imaginative and innovative \\"Who Framed Roger Rabbit\\" like me, what really matters in making people happy is something else.
0307237699|4.0|This was a good, informative book on Barack Obama's personal beliefs as well as his political philosophies.  Each chapter starts with a life experience that lets you know where he is coming from on each government issue that he discusses.  I'm not sure how interesting it would be for someone who already has some knowledge of Obama's ideals becuase it doesn't seem like he is saying anything too earth-shattering.    Another interesting thing is that his sincerity comes across the same way on paper that it does when you listen to him on tv, especially when he discusses issues of faith and morality.

B002SJIO5E|2.0|This movie has far too many holes in its storyline for it to be considered a good movie.  The director and producers are hoping that you only notice the good CGI work and ignore the rest.  As you watch it, you will see more and more holes develop where events happen or the main character performs a feat that should in no way be successful, but is.  Plus the fact that it is shot to look like handheld footage, this is more of a bad Cloverfield than anything else (and that wasn't a good movie either).<br /><br />The holes in the storyline are obvious if you have seen the Bourne movies - these movies have very few, if any, parts of the plot where you can't believe that he got away with something, or that he did a task that didn't get him caught.  In this movie, the main character does too many things that miraculously turn out OK, although if you think about it for a minute there is no way he should have gotten away with it.<br /><br />Don't waste your time, the CGI is good but not good enough to warrant watching it.  If you want to see a movie with great special effects AND a great story, watch JJ Abrams' Star Trek - now that was the best movie of 2009.
0452295548|2.0|I heard a podcast with Jill Bolte Taylor which was very intriguing. Imagine a neuroscientist experiencing her own stroke, and able to recall it all afterwards!  Unfortunately, I didn't find the book nearly as interesting as her interview on NPR's Fresh Aire.  The book starts off with a couple chapters of neuroanatomy, which were very very dry. The next few chapters are about the actual stroke, and then there are a few chapters on the recovery.  After that, about the last 1/2 of the book turns into preachy self-discovery, self-help information.  I guess if I had been expecting this, it would be okay, but I was not, and thus the \\"recovery guide\\" portion was just too much.  And unfortunately, Dr. Taylor is not a very engaging writer.  Anyway, great story, amazing recovery, just not the book for me.
B00006AFF5|4.0|\\"How the Grinch Stole Christmas,\\" (2000), a live-action movie based upon the popular Dr. Seuss children's story stars Jim Carry in one of his usual over-the-top performances: he's an actor who is not going to go unnoticed in any flick. Ron Howard is the director, and Anthony Hopkins does the narration.<br />As a baby the Grinch turns up on doorstep and is brought up by two women who love him even though he is a weird looking kid, far different from the other children in Whoville. In school he is ostracized by the other kids except for one girl, Martha May, who can see worth in the inner child. He becomes a scapegoat, is feared and despised and chooses to live up on a mountain above the town where he recycles the town's garbage. He has a dog like Annie's Sandy. He hates everything about Whoville but especially Christmas.<br />He is bizarrely different, hairy and green with hands like webs. A little girl is not frightened of him and befriends him and visits his cave. She believes she can reform him. It's not a particularly original notion, redemption through the child, but it seems to work. The town is giving out a special prize, and she talks the town into making him the recipient. The ceremony where he is made the town's hero is joyful and full of music and dancing, probably one of the best moments in the film.<br />The mayor is a nasty, bad guy who tries to turn the townspeople, simpletons, against the Grinch.<br />Later the Grinch steals everyone's Christmas presents, decorations, and Yule trees and puts them into one giant Santa sack with his one dog pulling a sleigh in place of the eight reindeer.<br />It's not a movie that's easy to like with a lot of predictable stuff. Frenetic Carrey and rather simplistic storytelling keep it from drawing you in. It's a typical overwrought Carrey performance, but because he's so off-the-wall, the kiddies may love it. The Grinch is not really a monster but rather a bad joke with a nasty temperament.
1578988411|5.0|I love this book.  I first read it when I was 16 and using the techniques described in the book found it to be a really helpful tool to getting what I wanted.  I lost my copy so I reordered this version.  However this book is textbook style rather than your standard sized paperback like I thought.  It's thinner and larger sized than your standard paperback and perhaps that makes it easier to highlight and read for people at their desks but I was looking for the standard paperback sized version which is easier to read in bed.  Just thought you should know what you were purchasing.  But the content is excellent!
B0028RXXE8|1.0|Men in tights, you can see some chicks bods though. But the same old bunch of guys with swords talking about who rules with Renaissance festival accents. reminds me of the movie \\"role models\\" and how ridiculous that medevil park was but it was funny.     Bought this, the tudors and felt betreyed. Wont do a series like this ever again!
B002VEB228|4.0|First, let me start off by saying that in general I really like Steve Zahn's and Timothy Olyphant's movies.  I thought that the plot line in this move looked interesting enough.  Sadly though, I couldn't find it to rent at Redbox, or even to buy at most Wal-Marts.  So I was really let down.  I thought to look it up here and low and behold found a version to rent for cheap, so I jumped on it.  I was really surprised by how much I liked the movie.  Now I will say, it's not an Oscar nominee, but I don't think anyone chosing to watch this film is expecting that anyway.  I will say that some of the plot explaination is shakey at best, but the overall energy of the film, I think, makes up for it.  It's a great movie to check out if you just want to sit back and be entertained for a bit!  Hope the review is helpful, oh, and if I haven't mentioned it yet...  Watch It!!
0439023483|5.0|I finished this book at 2:00 am because I couldn't put it down. Fantastic. I wasn't sure at first- The Hunger Games starts out a little slow for my taste, and the main character, Katniss, seems a touch naive in the beginning. But once she enters the Hunger Games, hold on. Fast-paced action without seeming frantic, a solid story, and an emotionally complex character make this book unforgettable.  Although the main characters are young (12-16), the story is very adult. There is a lot of violence, though not terribly graphic. But what makes it so good is the emotional maturity. The author manages to balance the fears, worries, and self-examintation of the teenagers with their very real struggles to stay alive in a way that feels fresh and true.   I hate to give anything away, but I can't help comparing The Hunger Games with Stephen King's \\"The Long Walk\\"- something about the tone and the contest linked them in my mind. So if you are a fan of that story, you will love this book. I am ordering the second book in the series, and I can't wait to find out what happens next.
B000P12LWY|1.0|Actors walking around with swords and Renaissance festival accents.HBO's Rome was the same way (weren't those supposed to be italians. I hated it. Anyone want my rome and my tudors... trade ya for just about anything. !
B001C3KCSY|5.0|CDs like this one don't stay in top selling status for a year for no reason. I finally got this and am glad I did. Just really good music, distinctive and original.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|Star Trek is a very good movie, even with the technical issues (e.g. traveling through a singularity).  The acting is first rate, the effects are a little better than the other movies, and the music is ok.  The energy is what makes it all come together.  Urban is excellent as McCoy, and Pine is great as Kirk.  Pike is fantastic.  The rest are good...although I didn't care for the new Chekov.<br /><br />However, this review isn't about the movie, but rather the Blue Ray version.  First, let me state that this was the first Blue Ray disc I've watched.  Sadly, I didn't see anything truly spectacular in the resolution...my hopes were too high I guess.  The movie disc was as good as you could expect, but the extras are what I was most interested in.  I had hoped to watch the movie with the deleted scenes inserted but sadly, I didn't find an option for that.  The deleted scenes were stunning; I can't figure out why they took them out of the final movie (except the klingon scenes...I didn't care for them at all).  The rest would have made the movie even better!<br /><br />The starship simulator is a mystery to me, because I couldn't get it to come up.  It just showed a little dialog box as an introduction and never did anything else.  I'm sure it is there but the interface confused me.<br /><br />The casting extra was interesting but I had hoped to see some screenings of the actors screen tests.<br /><br />The tribute to Roddenberry was very good.<br /><br />The gags (outtakes) were ok but too many 'prepared' outtakes for me.<br /><br />I haven't watched the rest yet.  I don't have to to give it 5 stars.  If you like the movie, you'll love the dvd.
031606792X|4.0|I was bitten by the Twilight books recently after watching the Twilight Movie. I read the first 3 books in record time and much like many others could not wait for the finale of Edward and Bella to see what became of such an impossible love match.    I was a bit worried after reading the reviews here after I had already purchased this book, but I felt that since I had received it I wanted to read it to form my own opinions. I am glad I did do that because I was very happy with the story and did enjoy it.     I will add that I'm a 36 year old Mom of 4 kids ranging from ages 8 months to 8 years and I've been married for 13 years. I am a huge romance fan and as far as paranormal goes, Kresley Cole and Gena Showalter are authors I adore. Obviously those are written for an adult audience and the Twilight series is written with a different audience in mind, with a sweeter, but not less appealing tone.     Spoilers:  In the reviews I read about the book, were complaints about much from this story line. I'd like to address some of those:  The name of the baby I felt did a nice tribute to both Bella's Mom and Edward's Mom. I felt it wonderful that Jacob included Charlie in the know so to speak because as a parent, the thought of what he would feel losing Bella was hard for me to grasp. So I appreciated that she was able to maintain her relationship with him. The Mother was not seen in the story and despite Bella being sick, I was not thinking as I read \\"she would have been there\\". I always got the impression she was flighty and Bella was more the caretaker for her. I didn't feel let down by the build up to the fight. I was on the edge of my seat the whole because it felt like it could have gone either way. I also felt the pain of what Bella was going through trying to not only save her daughter but to also try to save Edward and all those standing beside them.  The maturity of Bella and Edward in the parental role might not appeal to a younger reader but it did appeal to me.Bella was strong (though I always felt she was strong to fall in love and trust without a doubt in Edward). Bella and Edward were given what I perceived to be a beautiful gift in their daughter and though it was never the plan or in the cards for them. They took to that role beautifully. I was happy that Jacob imprinted on Nessie. Honestly I had been annoyed with Jacob in New Moon and Eclipse. For me it was like I began to like him again and began cheering for him where as in the other books I wanted Edward to just injure him LOL. I do think that the characters took a more mature twist. I could definitely not see it from the first books where they would end up. But I cheered from Twilight that Edward would turn Bella and that they would be able to live \\"happily ever after\\". The bonds of the Cullen family as always is inspiring. The fact that Bella took to being a vampire with such ease that non had seen before, I felt was a wonderful thing (because I wanted her to keep that human part of herself at least). She had feared the worst and she ended up getting the best which I thought was a wonderful way to take these characters out in a wonderful way.   I do think the author has given us potential for several other characters to develop and for their own stories to appear. Jacob and Nessie for one is something I'd like to see more of. I'd like to see more of Sam as well and see what happens to him.
B000ZELISO|2.0|Is it over yet? That's what I was thinking as this 6th installment of the Harry Potter series unfolded in front of me. Then when it actually did end my kids and I said almost in unison, \\"That's the end?!?\\" Wow. If ever I've seen a movie that was pure filler until the next installment...Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince was it! What a completely forgettable movie.<br /><br />Harry Potter and the Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber of Secrets, Prisoner of Azkaban, Goblet of Fire & Order of the Phoenix were all at minimum very good. Certainly Sorcerer's Stone, Chamber and Goblet of Fire are as memorable as it gets. Azkaban was relatively slow compared to the others, and Order of the Phoenix, was also a bit drawn out, but still pretty good.<br /><br />The A-list actors giving A-list performances goes on and on in this series of films....You have Richard Harris (GRHS) who was flawlessly and un-noticeably (no disrespect intended) replaced by Michael Gambon; Miranda Richardson, Gary Oldman, there's Alan Rickman doing his best Jeremy Irons imitation, Ralph Fiennes, John Hurt, Shirley Henderson, John Cleese and of course Robbie Coltrane as Hagrid. I know I'm forgetting more, but you get the idea.<br /><br />Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber were brilliantly led by the direction of Veteran Chris Columbus ([[ASIN:B00008N6NQ Home Alone]] and tons more). And the cast of these films?...How often do three unknowns (Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter, Emma Watson as Hermione Granger and Rupert Grint as Ron Weasley) walk into overnight stardom? Not very often. But these three sure did. And it's well deserved. Their characters are well acted and believable; not bad for a bunch of preteens whose debuts now seem so long ago.<br /><br />Azkaban was really good and certainly an integral part of the Harry Potter progression of stories. But Azkaban was the first hand-off of the director baton from Columbus to the short resumed, mostly-foreign-film-guy Alfonso Cuar&oacute;n (prior to [[ASIN:B000N6TX1I Children of Men]]). Columbus still had oversight as a producer to Azkaban, so perhaps Cuar&oacute;n felt intimidated by Columbus' brilliance in Sorcerer's Stone and Chamber...or perhaps Cuar&oacute;n just held back from doing his own thing. Be that as it may, the change in \\"direction\\" really showed through. And Cuar&oacute;n was gone for Goblet.<br /><br />Goblet comes in with three changes in direction: 1) The director change from Cuar&oacute;n back to another vet in Mike Newell ([[ASIN:B000NQPZCO Donnie Brasco]]), 2) The exit of Columbus oversight, and 3) A shift from...shall we say...a more famlyish Harry Potter to a more dark Harry Potter (the way it was intended!). And this did not go un-noticed by the MPAA.<br /><br />The Dirctor's Chair went to a relatively inexperienced David Yates for Order of the Phoenix, but at least Yates stayed the course started by Newell and kept the darkness (and the PG-13) in. Yates' directional talents are clearly inferior to his predecessors, and it really shows in Half Blood Prince. Either the main cast has lost their heart or Yates simply could not get out of his cast what they were once capable of. It is mostly Radcliffe's, Watson's, Grint's and especially Tom Felton's (Malfoy) performances that were blatantly lacking. Maybe now that this crew has grown up, it simply turns out that as adults they can't act. But that's where a more qualified director should have come in to finish off what started as a Class-A series.<br /><br />It must be tough to make a PG movie these days; it's hard to believe that the MPAA took the Potter series from a PG rating to a PG-13 rating starting with Goblet. Kids 13 and under can see uglier violence and hear more profanity at school recess and at the local playground than they do in Harry Potter movies. How is it that a movie like Goblet without a curse-word or graphic act of violence (by today's standards anyway) gets thrown into the same category as, for example, [[ASIN:B000K0YLLY Alien Vs. Predator]], that does indeed not only have profanity, but strong violence? Ludicrous. But I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to \\"protect\\" our youth.<br /><br />I will indeed finish by saying that the Harry Potter releases combined have grossed billions of dollars because--up until Half Blood--they're excellent movies that kids can watch too. So stick that in your pipe and smoke it, MPAA. The fair MPAA rating for Half Blood would be NG. Not as Good.<br /><br />Yates is on board for the final two...that's right, I said TWO...in the Harry Potter series. Deathly Hallows is announced for 2010 and Deathly Hallows Part 2 for 2011. Way to milk it, buddy. Yates had better step it up several notches and get this series back to form if he expects me to fork over the Blu Ray bucks for Hallows instead of waiting for cable.<br /><br />Is this rambling, long-winded review over yet? Yes, it is. And I hope it saved you some money.ut I won't get started on how unfair the MPAA is and how neurotically insane the pressure is from certain groups on the MPAA to \\"protect\\" our youth.

B002SJIO4A|4.0|I am as soft as melted ice cream and wont watch gory or disturbing film, and I had no problem with the level of violence portrayed in this film, so rest easy those of you with gentle dispositions.     This film could be interpreted by some as an unsophisticated look at South Africas treatment of their minorities, and I suspect part of the reason that the film plays so well in a South African setting is how easily the humans subjugate the aliens, and what an unlikable bunch of arrogant people they collectively seemed to come across as in the film.    Its nice to see Lethal Weapon 2's nice work in generating South Africans as your stereotypical evil race in films. Now we have Arabs, the British and South Africans taking the traditional role of the Russians prior to the break up of the cold war.     The fact that the central character is so unlikable, and has the name Wikus (I could only think of Michael Palins Pilate in Life of Brian saying \\"Wikus Dickus\\") is a masterstroke, why should films have a likeable star just to make everyone feel all warm and lovely about themselves. Sometimes, stuff happens to those who aren't Brad Pitt or Matt Damon types and they have to deal with it as best they can.    Also an interesting counterpoint is the fact that the black population is as enthusiastic as subjugating the aliens as the white, perhaps not seeing their own history reflected in the plight of the \\"Prawns\\", it must be remembered that the spaceship arrived in Jo'burg when Apartheid was still at its height, and some back-story perhaps integrating the arrival of the ship into the breakdown of that social system might have strengthened the story a little.    Which brings me to my biggest gripe, the lack of back-story isn't critical in this film, but would have added a lot to my enjoyment of the film, where did they come from, why did they come to earth, why were they in such a poor state when they got here, why didn't they defend themselves against the humans with their advanced weapons?     This is overall, however, a film about human nature, and could be transplanted across our globe and throughout our history when a dominant society subjugates a submissive one, and as such makes provoking and interesting viewing.
1439138311|4.0|Brooklyn is the story of an Irish girl called Eilis who moves from Ireland to Brooklyn in the 1950s in search of work. When she arrives in Brooklyn she's homesick at first, but gradually she finds her feet. She gets a job working in a department store, studies bookkeeping in the evenings and starts a relationship with a man she meets at a dance. Then things come to a head and she needs to make a decision whether her future lies in the US or Ireland.<br /><br />Eilis is a very passive character. If there's a way to avoid making decisions or taking action, that's what she'll do. Almost everything that she does is arranged for her: moving to America, where she lives, where she works, what she studies. Again and again she finds people to take care or her or make decisions for her, although interestingly she simultaneously holds them at arm's length. She can be irritatingly reserved. For example, early in the novel she goes to a dance with a friend. A man doesn't talk to her and she thinks he's rude. So rather than making the effort to strike up a conversation, she leaves.<br /><br />So it's slow and there's no major action. Despite this, I found the book quite compelling and hard to put down, although I can also see why someone may not like it. It slowed me down and drew me in. I felt like I was seeing life through her eyes. The people she met all felt real, the situations all felt true. It's a short book but it feels totally satisfying. Like eating a meal slowly and really thinking about the tastes and textures in your mouth. It's a simple story, but it gets under your skin and stays with you.
0756405890|5.0|So, I had this book recommended by a few friends whom I had recommended George R.R. Martin's book too, but I just kept forgetting the title! Finally I ordered it and, after it sat by my bedside for a few weeks, I picked it up.  Then I put it down for a week, then picked it up again and finished in a few days.<br /><br />This is the first book in a very long while that I literally couldn't stop thinking about. I would skip out on plans just so I could sit down with this story. It's a fantastic read--very well written, great characters and universe, but really, the writing just flows so well and the pacing so effortless, that it is almost impossible to put down.  Remember that great feeling of \\"just one more chapter\\" after glancing at the clock? This book is all about that feeling.<br /><br />My biggest frustration is not being able to figure out when Book 2 is coming out! I hope it's soon!
B0030CIAQQ|1.0|From the moment the hideously out-of-tune piano, cimbalom, etc. began bombarding (invading) the acoustical environment of the theater, I found my self continuously checking to see if blood was flowing copiously from my eardrums. As if the initial shock wasn't bad enough, the noise continued throughout the entire movie. While the movie was just okay (even the trite photographic \\"effects\\" were amateurish, at best), the music (if it can be called that) was simply horrid. I was distracted from the action on the screen because the score contributed absolutely nothing to the film and, indeed, was so intrusive that I wanted to scream STOP! STOP! Alas, that wasn't possible. By the end of the movie, my ears had become so traumatized by the obnoxious noise that I could barely move. While I wanted to bolt from the theater, I was so weakened by the ceaseless out-of-tune ostinato (the \\"score\\" really wasn't much more than that - a single BORING ostinato), that as I slowly made my way to the exit, I happened to notice that it had been written by Hans Zimmer. Hans Zimmer! Yes, that's the same guy who usually writes WONDERFUL scores. Frankly, I couldn't believe he had \\"composed\\" this sonic nightmare - so I ran home and double checked (by that time, my bleeding eardrums were, thankfully, recovering). Again, I couldn't believe it - Hans Zimmer not only decomposed this \\"music\\" but, in one review I read, proudly discussed his search for a well-abused piano to \\"feature.\\" Heck, listening to cats fight or babies screaming would be more pleasant. Fingernails on a chalkboard anyone? Let's just hope that Zimmer had a momentary lapse of sanity and that he'll go back to writing great scores again - this one was a disaster.
0385532458|5.0|As an avid reader of the short story, I was pleased to find John Grisham's \\"Ford County\\" an enjoyable read. Since all the stories are related geographically in Ford County, the book has the slightest breath of a novel, which many readers will appreciate. As you might expect from Grisham, the judicial arts are well represented in each story. In all, light reading well worth the time.

The sound is very different and Jared's voice is amazing.  I have heard random songs from them before like \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" and I have enjoyed it, and this cd is no exception to good music.

B001EAWMGA|4.0|This film shows yet again how much mileage there is in the old stories. Beowulf is a poem from the Anglo-Saxon oral bardic tradition, written down by someone who had read Vergil's Aeneid, and who gives a Christian overlay to a pagan legend - the monster Grendel is called by the scribe a \\"son of Cain\\". In the film, the hero (who has inadvertently brought the monster to Earth, along with his load of guilt) is named Kainan.   So how does this film compare with other films that draw on the Beowulf story? Sturla Gunnarsson, in Beowulf & Grendel, makes the monster an almost human troll, so he can dispense with CGI and focus more on the psychological than the physical conflicts. Much of this film's pleasure comes from following the hero's attempts to find out the truth in a confusing situation. John McTiernan's The 13th Warrior, based on Michael Crichton's novel, combines elements of the Beowulf story with other folklore and invention, and hooks the audience by giving it the point of view of the reluctant hero - a sophisticated man banished for his indiscretions from the refined Arab culture of the time. Like Outlander, it shows believable Vikings rather than Hollywood stereotypes. All three films benefit from using live human actors, unlike the recent atrocity where the actors contributed only their voices and their gestures in motion suits to the CGI.   If you want tortured and intricate characterization rather than believable conflict and action, you can always go back to Ingmar Bergman. But for a very entertaining and well done new version of an ancient story, this film would be hard to top.

B002R0F3Q2|5.0|Pros: I love the song \\"Love is a Disease\\" which is song #8 on the album. It's actually one of the most poignant love songs I've ever heard when it comes to the soulful longing people feel when they miss someone. The first few notes of that song grab me every time, and I can't help but surrender. She says the line, \\"I'm a baby when you leave.\\" If that's not vulnerability, I don't know what is.<br /><br />Much of the album is related to love; heartache, being in love, wanting, longing, missing someone.<br /><br />She says in one line (not sure the song it's in) where she says she'd rather risk the fall if she could just feel what it would be to fly. It's absolutely beautiful, and it's what neo-soul is all about.<br /><br />Cons: I'm not crazy about the drums. They're soft-pad synthesizer fake/imitation drums, if you know what I mean. Also, some of the tracks feel as though the beats were inserted after the words were written rather than the words written WITH the beats. I feel, in some respect, the music lacked integration with her incredibly talented voice.<br /><br />* All in all, I give it 5 stars... but it's only cause of her voice, the words, and the soulful presentation of her piano playing. Not so much the beats.

0385523904|5.0|One of the biggest dangers regarding North Korea is the giant joke Kim Jong-Il has become.  Pronouncements from his country make outrageous claims such as that he is the greatest golfer in the world, regularly shooting three or four hole-in-ones per game. On TV you can see the North Korean \\"happiness squad\\" of beautiful hand-picked young women crying tears streaked with heavy make-up when they see rain falling on a poster of \\"Dear Leader.\\"  And of course there is [[ASIN:B0007Y08IS Team America]]...<br /><br />In her book, \\"Nothing to Envy,\\" author Barbara Demick makes that point that this would all be funny, if it weren't for the suffering of the North Korean people who pay the price for Jong-Il's excesses.  North Koreans live in a hell on Earth that few humans could imagine, scraping off tree bark to try and serve as food, stepping over dead bodies of small children, picking corn from feces in order to re-use it as food.  All of this is carefully hidden from the world in order to protect the image of Kim Jong-Il and his fantasy kingdom he presides over. (One wonders if he actually believes his own propaganda.)<br /><br />Following the lives of six defectors, Demick gives us a full and complete picture of what lies behind the façade.  She wisely chose a broad spread of interviewees, from a student at a top university to a homeless child thief to an elderly woman who has always believed that North Korea is the greatest country on Earth and Jong-Il a benevolent father, Demick is careful to show all aspects of life.  Some lead an almost privileged existence, getting packages of money from Japanese relatives and able to indulge in luxuries such as a bowl of rice from time-to-time instead of ground-up corncobs and salty water.  Others sit helplessly watching their family die, including their children, wondering why on Earth they are still around to suffer more.<br /><br />Something that surprised me is how most North Koreans are wholly ignorant of the outside world, and believe that as poor as North Korea is, the rest of the world is in much worse shape.  They are constantly shown pictures of the bombed-out ruins of Japan and South Korea after WWII, and told that the countries are still in those devastated conditions.  One of the most powerful scenes was when Kim, a doctor, finally escapes across the river to China, where she finds a small farm house to take shelter in and realizes that even the house dog eats better than a doctor in North Korea.<br /><br />Even though I lived in Japan, with North Korea only a missile-shot away, I was never very scared of Jong-Il.  He was just too funny-looking, too ridiculous to seem a credible threat.  Now that I have read \\"Nothing to Envy,\\" I will shudder when I see him and know that pure evil doesn't always look blatantly scary.as North Korea is, the rest of the world is in much worse shape.

B000GIXEIG|2.0|I watched 2007's Beowulf and it was absolutely amazing so I rented this version. What a horrible movie! Beowulf was some guy with a bunch of hair on him and a kid could have stopped him! The whole movie was just people sitting around and talking! Horrible!
B0013LL2Z2|4.0|The special effects seem almost silly at times, compared to todays computer generated movies. The acting is also at times not so good, but overall it is a very interesting story about a possible future living in a closed dome city.

Regardless, this album is good...love, love \\"Te Amo\\" \\"Russian Roulette\\" and \\"Rude Boy.\\" You should definitely listen to the previews before you buy it to make sure you'll be into it as it is not her normal pop music. It's dark but beautiful.
B000YAA68C|4.0|What an original movie! I loved all the parts and loved the whole cast and characters.
B0016PM722|4.0|This is not a toy, it is definately a collectors item.  Just makes noise when it turns on, is moved around hits something or is shut off.  It is heavy and big.  Love the blue glow.
B00006JDVV|3.0|This movie was ok and had cool effects and a good cast. Gerard Butler had a small part in it but Christian Bale was in the whole movie. Overall it wasent bad but I wouldnt watch it on a regular basis. About 2 times is all I can watch it.
B000E1MXSW|4.0|I found this movie very entertaining in terms of watching Audrey Hepburn with her wide array of talent.  It was also, what I felt, to be an accurate depiction of the life of a nun which was interesting to watch as well.  If you are an Audrey fan, you'll like this performance.
B00005JPLW|4.0|You will never see a war movie like this! If you like the way Sin City was filmed you will like this. Everything about it was good. I just wish it was longer.
B000QXDED6|3.0|300 is an effects extravaganza, with a visual tone reminiscent of Sin City -- another successful Frank Miller graphic novel adaptation. The production design is to be applauded on all counts as this film looks remarkable throughout. It suffers, however, from some truly portentous dialogue (although, in fairness, it's hard to imagine the conversations that took place between such people during such times). It also borders on gratuitous in its depiction of violence, with arguably too frequent use of slow-motion during the gorier moments. Most notable however, is the oddly depressive and oppressive feel to this movie. Perhaps it's because of the unrelenting grimness, or maybe it's just me. This is powerful stuff in many ways but it's not particularly enjoyable to watch. I'd give it 5 stars if the visual aspect was all that mattered but the sheer severity of the viewing experience left me a little too dispirited for top marks.
B0010358CQ|5.0|The action is better, and the story is more complex. I can't wait for the next installment!
B001U0HAYS|5.0|Despite the age, this movie holds up extremely well, even the action sequences. Great performances, fabulous cast. I think Redford was at his peak with this movie. He's the smartest guy in the room, but we're with him, following his thinking, which is fun, especially as he uses his wits to keep a step ahead of professionals who are quite sharp themselves. The only thing you'll find dated in this movie is the sideburns, but they're getting to be fashionable again as well, aren't they?    Top recommendation from me!
B001992NUQ|5.0|Considering this is the 10th Anniversary Edition of the movie, you've probably already seen it. But, a basic rundown of the film is this:<br /><br />A man (who remains unnamed through the film, and played by Edward Norton) is an insomniac. In order to deal with this issue, he attends support groups for people with diseases/problems in order to make himself feel better and sleep at night. He meets up with Tyler Durden (played by Brad Pitt) and eventually ends up staying with him due to the circumstances of the loss of his own apartment. Together, they make their own 'help group' called Fight Club. While it helps this group of men feel better and take back their lives, it eventually gets out of control and becomes something that Tyler calls \\"Project Mayhem\\". Edward Norton's character feels the need to stop Tyler once one of the members of the group is killed. And... then there's the surprise ending that you don't expect at all.<br /><br />This synopsis makes a very outstanding movie sound extremely dull, and I apologize for it. I just didn't want to spoil anything if you happen to have been in a cave for the last 10 years. Anyway, onto the BLU-RAY!<br /><br />The menus on the Blu-Ray are great. I genuinely feel that they put all the effort they could into this release. Everything looks fantastic. And there's even a prank on it when you first turn on the movie--which I won't spoil if you don't already know it.<br /><br />The sound and video are great. This is about as near to perfect as you can get.<br /><br />I'm not one to double-dip on movies if I already have the DVD, but this is actually worth picking up on Blu-Ray as well.
B001AVCFK6|1.0|I wanted to like this movie. I was open to the concept. But this movie just dragged on and on.    Like the Star Wars prequels, the most fun is just identifying characters and drawing connections to the Original Series characters and events we know and love. On its own, though, it's just not much of a story.    What the movie lacks is heart. The surface plot doesn't suffice. The only character that makes any sense is the bad guy who's flying some big ship that looks like what the Babylon 5 shadows would fly if they had giant battle cruisers.    Look, if you're going to mash up Star Trek, at least make it fun! Give us something to sink our teeth into. This cotton candy grows stale a good hour before final credits.    Side note: Zachary Quinto did a pretty good job at capturing Spock's body language, but the voice was all Syler. That was distracting. I kept expecting him to point his finger at someone's forehead and....
B001F12J48|2.0|The Polar Express Presented in 3-D is as most say - Not Very Good. I kept thinking something was wrong with the TV or lighting or even maybe the glare but after trying different things I realized that it was just the poor quality in 3-D. It is true the Red images and Blue images do not come together - for the entire movie you see double of everything. The snow effect and other small items will come in 3-D pretty good but all in all, I wish I had never gotten it without reading all the reviews. I have not tried it on a 1080p TV yet but if it is truly better as one reviewer stated, I will make sure and update this review and note that.
B0010ZR160|4.0|\\"Mystic River\\" set the bar pretty high for a Denis Lehane novel adapted for the big screen.  While \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" certainly doesn't rise to that level, it is a worthy big screen adaptation.  Ben Affleck makes his directorial debut and not surprisingly, given his Boston roots, manages to superbly capture the people and place that is blue-collar Boston in this missing child crime drama.<br /><br />While there are some holes in the plot, it is the litany of stellar acting performances by Casey Affleck, Amy Ryan, Ed Harris and Titus Welliver among other, that stand out in \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" -- not to mention another gem by Morgan Freeman in limited screen time.  I was originally a bit skeptical about Casey Affleck, but in spite of his early 20s appearance, I thought he was exceptional as a young private eye in above his head in an abducted child case.  When Amy Ryan's daughter disappears, Affleck and his lover/partner Monaghan are hired by Adam's sister-in-law and brother to supplement the police investigation.<br /><br />Ryan is amazing as a drug-addicted and all but worthless mother of the missing girl Amanda.  While you hope for the safety of her daughter, Amanda, it is hard to feel much compassion for Ryan and her pathetic ways.  \\"Gone Baby Gone\\" is definitely worthy of viewing and will spark some heated dialogue about the right moral and ethical choices.  As the story unwinds, the tension stays at a fever pitch and the interplay of the characters keeps you deeply engaged until the final morally conflicting denouement.

B000W7JWUA|5.0|This is one of the most fun board games we've ever played.<br /><br />Pros:<br />LOTS of fun<br />Gameplay is variable if you want it to be (you can set the board game up differently each time you play, or use the beginner's set up)<br />Requires you to use your brain (strategy)<br /><br />Cons:<br />Lots of pieces...most small or small-ish...that can get lost or that kids could swallow if you're not careful.<br />Somewhat steep learning curve. It's easier than it seems at first, however. One of those games that is harder to explain than to play.<br />Only 4 players at 1 time...literally...due to the design. There are extensions/expansions that allow more people to play, but they are crazy expensive too.<br />Expensive
0385737424|5.0|I have wanted to read this book ever since I heard librarian Nancy Pearl talk about it on NPR.  She said the magic words: she said it was an homage to Madeleine L'Engle's A Wrinkle in Time, one of my very favorite novels when I was a child a million years ago.<br /><br />A Wrinkle in Time is also the favorite novel of 12-year-old Miranda, a sixth grader living in Manhattan in 1978.  Miranda is rehearsing a story in her head.  She needs to tell the story to a somewhat scary unknown person who's been leaving her hidden notes and appears to know the future.  The first note says, \\"I am coming to save your friend's life and my own.\\"  It asks Miranda to write a letter relating the story of the events of the novel, and it asks that she deliver the letter by hand.<br /><br />This is a bizarre and meaningless request when Miranda first reads it.  But as the story unfolds, slowly, slowly, everything becomes clear.  By the time you get to the end, you will understand everything that Miranda did.<br /><br />Nancy Pearl and her librarian friends are predicting that When You Reach Me will win the Newberry Medal for \\"the most distinguished contribution to American literature for children.\\"  Let's see...  The writing is excellent.  The character's breathe life.  The plotting is superlative.  And one more thing--by the time I reached the end, I was truly moved.  I don't know if it was the story's poignancy or if I was just feeling nostalgic or if it was something in between, but for a few hours this 41-year-old was 12 again.  And if that's not time travel, I don't know what is.
075640407X|5.0|Quite literally the best book I've ever read, with the exception of the Bible, which is far more than just a book.<br /><br />Rothfuss is an incredible talent. The book is deep, engaging, powerful. It is a meaty thing...in a good way. I didn't want it to end, and for such a (relatively) long book, that's saying something. Excellently drawn, deep characters...likable but flawed and complex. Great plotting, excellent world-building. The magic system is one of the best I've seen. Many standard fantasy tropes are used, but in a fresh and unique way. Kudos to Rothfuss for taking what has become a somewhat stale genre, and making it new and fresh. Great, great stuff here. Can't recommend it highly enough!
B002VPE1AM|5.0|At first I really wasn't interested in seeing this movie. It didn't look like the type of movie I would want to go see. My mom went with her husband because he wanted to see it. When she got back she told me I really should go see it. So I did. I saw it in Imax at the El Dorado hills theatre. I was blown away. This movie has everything. It has love and romance, violence, action, saddness, science, and the graphics are breathtaking. I would recommend this movie to anyone of any age over thirteen-fourteen years old. This movie, however, is not for children. It has some scary parts that would frighten young children and the storyline would be hard for them to follow and understand. I extremely recommend that, if you are 13 or older to see this movie. It is an experience you don't want to miss.
B000NQRE0K|5.0|This is, quite possibly, the best movie ever made. Yes, I'm serious.

HIGHLY recommended!

1594488843|5.0|While I've been a fan of Dan's since A Whole New Mind, one of the things I worry most about in books by the same author is whether or not there will be any new material, or if it will simply be a retread/recycle/update for the sake of a new cover.    Thankfully, this book is not only entirely new - it is entirely useful.     The bridge that Dan builds between the science (which is absolutely required to make a case beyond the squishy motivational stuff that clutters the business section) and the viable application of motivation research to both individuals and companies is truly helpful.    On top of this, Dan adds the toolkit, which is very likely (at least for me, and I suspect anyone who spends the time to use any or all of it) to be the most valuable portion of this effort.    As some reviewers have noted, this is essentially 2 books in one: the research without the toolkit is a good read, but Dan's gift to the reader of the toolkit makes this a book that won't go straight on the shelf, but will be kept on the desk to help during the year.    Highly recommended!

Reminded me a lot of \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", plenty of wit, perhaps not as much masochism when it came to protagonists though, which I actually preferred.  Definitely worth a read.
0345298349|4.0|Martin Cruz Smith's GORKY PARK is the height of pulp fiction during the early 1980s. It combines page turning with a detailed look at Russia's disfunctional society in the 70s. Smith has the ability to describe the ugliness, decadence, and despeartion of a country and a people that has lost all hope. Where there is no eschatology, the harshness of life strips all brightness from life, even the blood as Smith describes it, appears colorless. Arkady Renko fights through that meaningless. Meaning to him is solving the crime, even if that means the loss of all personal privilege.
0312360266|4.0|This book is good for being YA.  I liked it but did get board with the struggling with three guys thing.  They throw a lot on her shoulders for being a teen and what they consider a flegling.  Age group I would say 12-18....
0679731369|3.0|The main narrator, Geoffrey Braithwaite, a retired Dr. and Flaubert buff, spends some time in France investigating the author of Madame Bovary. It start's off with Braithwaite spending alot of time wondering about Flaubert trivia, for example looking into what happened with the stuffed parrot Flaubert had for a time, viewing places Flaubert once lived in, etc. As the novel progresses it goes a little further afield with one chapter where Braithwaite talks about his own life, mostly relating to his wife (who has some parrallels with Madame Bovary), one chapter written as a retort by Louise Colet, Flaubert's paramour, and towards the end a mini Flaubert dictionary and a mock exam.    PROS   It's different. At just under 200 pages it's lean, compact. Barnes has a very nice prose style - elegant and detailed. (Maybe he learned a little something from Flaubert.) It was kind of interesting learning about Flaubert and the time he lived in.    CONS  It had no dramatic tension. I don't really care about Flaubert's parrot (or a lot of the other trivia) and I don't believe the narrator did either. It was a little too aloof.    SUMMARY - I'm not likely to reread this book, but I'd like to check out some other books by Barnes, if he's written something more conventional, less gimmicky.
B002KDUDG6|5.0|This cd is lovely.  A refreshing mix of standards and retro (70's) tunes.  Buble is hard to resist. His voice is just like buttah and the band is great. About the time I think that all of the songs have been sung and reworked, he reinvents sound.

It competes with the very worst songs ever in the English language, and doubtless the world over.  It is a hideously self-indulgent and whining piece of self-pitying and self-righteous teen angst (did I mention self-pitying?).  I guess that explains the album's title.  But seriously, maybe these guys have something to offer, but it will take a lot of good material to outbalance the harm done by this truly wretched song.  Maybe you should try to hear this song in its entirety, though.  It is an experience you'll never forget, try as you might.

B002H3F7F6|5.0|I have to say that I was immediately intrigued at the prospect of a Christmas Album from Sting. That was how I was first alerted to this recording. I imagined all kinds of things in my head about what something `seasonal' would sound like, and boy I was surprised at the outcome.<br /><br />First, let me say that this really is a fabulous recording and very rich. If you are into Sting at all, you'll love this, or rather any of the three versions that are currently out there:<br /><br />1. If On A Winter's Night ... [[ASIN:B002H3F7F6 (audio CD)]]<br />2. If On A Winter's Night ... [[ASIN:B002N0KMP8 (CD and Documentary w/single)]]<br />3. If On A Winter's Night ... [[ASIN:B002QCKOOW (Live from Durham Cathedral DVD)]]<br /><br />And yes, there's even a vinyl release and a few other options just in case you just have to get them.<br /><br />I had some choice things to say about the exclusion of `Ghost Story' from the line-up on the CD, but if you're so inclined to hear them play this version of the song, you can and should purchase the Live at Durham Castle DVD as that really is magnificent, too. A lot of people have actually bought the CD because they heard this version played live on PBS and were disappointed that it wasn't on the CD. I actually prefer the `Brand New Day' version myself, as I found the timing a bit too fast, but that's just me.<br /><br />The folksy-esque version of `Hounds of Winter' is easily my favourite version of this song that I've yet heard and is really a beautiful reworking of a classic. It's a good thing Sting, and his ever faithful cadre of musicians are willing to attempt re-workings and do covers of their own stuff, unlike many other musicians and bands. Variation on a Theme is soup d'jour in classical music and Sting obviously takes a cue from it. Also, all the best musicians and people that he normally works with are back. Dominic Miller looks a lot like Willem Dafoe these days, but that's fine as everyone's gotten a bit long in the tooth, Sting included. I've always believed that Chris Botti is Sting's illegitimate son, which is fine with us, but it's no surprise that he shows up here playing on a Christmas album with `dear ol' dad.' He's a fine musician in his own right and a plus to listen to. Sting's beard is a nice touch, but he does wear it like one of his Chet Atkins guitars. It looks a little too good, if you know what I'm saying. My wife said: \\"Wow. He looks amazing.\\" We could all wish to age so well.<br /><br />I've read many reviews and have heard most of what folks are saying in criticism about this release. Sting was listening to this album or that artist. This version is older and better and done by so and so. Well, the truth is that if you're looking for folk music from the British Isles, then Sting would probably not be your first choice anyway. You might go with a plethora of other artists before buying a Sting CD.<br /><br />Sting has always walked that fine line of `Pop' artist, which he absolutely hates, and yes, for the record he does make pop music, and does so very well. He always struggles and pushes himself to produce Classical, Jazz, Avant-Garde, Experimental, Country-Western, Hindi, etc.. In all honesty, Sting has always been all over the map trying to shed that `Pop' image, but I doubt he ever will. His early body of work is just too damn good for it.<br /><br />Did you ever see that `Feed the World' video from the eighties? Ever notice how `uncomfortable' he looks around all of his other 'pop/rock' peers? How out of place the expression on his face screams? Trust me when I say this, as a fan of his, that he's been like this most of his life, probably even since the Police. It's always been about `him' and trying to make a grand statement with music. Something `greater than'. I don't blame the guy for trying, and `trying' he does. Here is a place where he actually succeeds. Hey, it's his name on the billing, not mine.<br /><br />The `experimental' element to this album is his voice. Here he tries to pull off a rich and thick baritone that has the ingredients of a `Tom Waits'-sans gravel. He works on the lower registers well, but it is something that does stand out on every version as it's not his usual `talky' tone that we normally hear. It's not bad, it works in some spots, but it's also like an American actor trying to carry a British accent for the entire length of a feature film. Sometimes it works and sometimes it doesn't, but you do leave knowing that it wasn't true and that it was a bit forced. Here, the same thing applies, but I didn't deduct any points for it as the music does call for it. Why not.<br /><br />...ingredients of a `Tom Waits'-sans gravel.

0671027344|4.0|In this book, the protagonist Charlie is a freshman who grows up in experience and self-confidence throughout the book. In fact he is the one who is called a \\"wallflower\\", because he \\"hears things, understands them and keeps quiet about them\\". He also has to deal with the suicide of his best friend and the death of his favorite family member, his aunt. Altough, throughout the book he learns with the help of two seniors and his English teacher more about life, dealing with love, drugs and sexuality. He falls the first time in love, goes to partiess and takes drugs. He learns to share his problems and opinions by writing it down. The word choice in this book is directed towards young high school students. I also love how it's written. It is written in a series of letters to an anonymous friend. The basic theme of this book is that active participation is much better than passive. It's better to live your life participating and pursuing your dreams rather than standing on the sidelines and watching the actions.
0307456625|5.0|This is the first in the series of the Alexander McCall Smith books featuring a lady detective in Botswana, Precious Ramotswe.<br /><br />Precious has many adventures in this book with several interesting supporting characters like Happy Bapetsi - the names are great all by themselves. While relating all this, the book introduces readers to what apparently life is like in Botswana. It seems to be quite an interesting culture, especially in its viewpoints on life.<br /><br />Here is one example of the latter. While Precious is daydreaming about her retirement to come one day in the future, she thinks how sorry she is for white people, because they worry themselves about things that are going to happen anyway. What good does all their money do them if the can't sit still and take in the view? She thought that the rare white people who understood the truth were regarded with suspicion by the other whites. As a white person, I must say that Precious may have a point here.<br /><br />The book is worth a look for the Botswana philosophy alone. Give it a try.
0316069906|5.0|I have been a vegetarian for 25 years. Vegan for about a year about 6 years ago, and now remain mostly, but not fully, vegan. I am a neuroscientist, and consider myself relatively informed and well read. Yet, I learned SO much from this book - more than I ever wanted to know perhaps, but acknowledge that I *should* know.    I am married to an omnivore, who will forever remain an omnivore. But this book changed things. Oddly enough, the heroes that emerge in this book are not vegan or vegetarians. They are the animal farmers who remain true to their values, in spite of a system that relentlessly tries to put them out of work.     Yes, you might say that that's what Michael Pollan has been writing about. It's not. This is a much more focus thesis, which is not G, but R rated. It does not leave out facts or descriptions to make the book more readable. It treats the readers like adults that, if they eat meat, are entitled to know EVERYTHING that went into producing that meat.    You should read the book even if you're a vegan or a vegetarian like me, because it WILL change the way you think, and it WILL make you aware and better equipped to deal with the question of \\"so why don't you eat meat\\"? If you live with a meat eater, it will help them understand you better. And it will probably affect what's in your fridge....     This is a fantastically written book, with excellent reliable sources, and is so important, it should be required reading for every high-schooler and college student. After all, it is THEIR future which is at stake here.
B0013FDM7E|1.0|One star because you must rate, no star if you want to be sincere.    To say the least, this is the worst one ever. The only thing you will enjoy is the deep bass and shattering effects of your subwoofer and sound system grespectively, apart from that, give your $12 to someone in need, or just assume you lost it outright.    Vague story line, useless suspense, meaningless conclusion.    The worst purchase I have made in recent times.
B002GYVRRI|5.0|A ' MUST HAVE' for any self respecting music lover. Bill Bruford has all the fun. John Wetton, Robert Fripp, Mel Collins AND Ian McDonald. This was the Crimson your father thought was the end of it all.  When Discipline arose in 1981, \\"RED\\" finally came to the stage as the beast it always was. \\"FALLEN ANGEL\\", \\"ONE MORE RED NIGHTMARE\\".  These aren't just 'rock songs' on a 'rock band album'. This is SERIOUS STRONG MEAT. The DVD includes the RAREST PIECE OF VIDEO ever.(next to the Oscar Levant Show).  SEEING Crimson LIVE in FRENCH TV STUDIO in 1974, is the best hidden piece of Art mankind ever stuck in the vault for 35 years. Let us be thankful for it.  \\"Lament\\" LIVE, \\"STARLESS\\" live.. SEE JOHN WETTON SING & PLAY BASS, SEE ROBERT FRIPP stare down the camera for invading his personal space. SEEING ROBERT FRIPP play the \\"STARLESS\\" guitar lines is like looking into the sun.  This release REPAIRS all time disturbances in the continuum. Get this NOW, before Earth ends!
0446698326|5.0|When I bought this book at a local book store the sales rep told me to savor the story and not to read it in one day. I accidently ignored her suggestion and ended up reading the whole book in one day. I am absolutely in love with the story and wish it never ended. I could have read an additional 300 pages and still leave the story wanting more. It was such a great book- the first Nicholas Sparks book I've ever read. There were parts where I felt like I could guess what was going to happen next, but Nicholas Sparks took it in a different direction while still allowing the story to develop in my head (and heart) in a way that makes you feel a true connection with the characters in the story. I finished the book wishing I could have been in the story rather than reading it. I can't wait to read it again.
B002LLE3Q8|5.0|THANK THE FRIPPIAN HEAVENS for including the ORIGINAL MIX of the 1969 Toe Tapping Classic Album.  The music unearthly. Remastering Bursts with Staccato Thunder of Michael Giles. As great as the new 2009 Stereo Mix is,  the original still has that Thrill that Fripp does to us oh so well.  This Issue is beyond 'recommended', to not enjoy this release  is to not enjoy life itself. As some other wise man once said; \\"I never met a Fripp I didn't Like\\"
0802136834|5.0|Alison Weir brings her wit and extensive knowledge of British history to life in this complete volume of the lives of Henry the 8th's six wives. Each woman leaps off the page as her personality is brought to light, and common misconceptions are dispelled by factual evidence and the detail of the research that was poured into this book. Even though this is nonfiction, it is every bit as compelling as fiction because it is presented in such a way as to be a compelling read from start to finish. There isn't a single page that is dry like so many history books tend to be. A great deal of the book focuses on Anne Boleyn, as she is most certainly the most notorious of the six. Everything from personal letters to household lists are used to paint the most accurate picture possible of how these women lived and what they were like, and most importantly how they dealt with this enigmatic and hugely promiscuous husband with a temper that became increasingly erratic as the years progressed. A must read for any fan of the Tudor era and a great companion to historical novels, if you are into getting the true story in addition to the fictional portrayal.
B002VKE1K2|3.0|I found Paranormal Activity refreshingly creepy. Not scary for me (although others felt otherwise). With at least 3 endings having been filmed, I'm surprised that only one alternative ending was included.    Regarding the Blu-ray version - how does someone outside the USA gain access to the digital copy?    Surely the blu-ray people and the film distributors can't have been so short-sighted as to make this feature geographically restricted?!
B001ED7C58|5.0|The item was in perfect condition and I really enjoy the CD. I have made the first song my ringtone.
B00288KNJU|1.0|The movie itself is WONDERFUL, but the 3D \\"feature\\" of this BluRay or DVD, is not was it was in the digital theater. The Real3D experience uses \\"polarized\\" glasses, which gives a more realistic 3d experience, as it does not have the blue-red glasses filter.    This disc release has been converted to the inferior, and VERY disappointing blue-red Anaglyph style.    Don't expect to watch this with the same brilliant 3d experience as in the theater.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|Loved  it   Here you have a totally ALIEN WORLD  with 10 ft HUMAN like aliens who are  physically and spiritually SUPERIOR to   humans ! ( without the technology and greed )    STATE of the ART in FILM making  , good casting ,  awesome video and sound-  I  saw it in 3D and will see it AGAIN !!!  I loved it -  been watching movies over 60 years  now !
0385504225|5.0|I have read all of Dan Browns books and here's how I rate them in order of my favorite first.    1. The Lost Symbol  2. Angels and Demons  3. Deception Point  4. The Da Vinci Code  5. Digital Fortress    I particularly enjoyed The Lost Symbol and could hardly put it down.  Same thing with Angels and Demons.  I read his books completely as fiction and enjoy them without getting caught up in whether something is 100% accurate like some other reviewers.  I read simply for the enjoyment of it.  Some of the twists had me gasping and I just thoroughly enjoyed it!
B002RVZV9U|1.0|This DVD is almost all talk and hardly any music. Very misleading. Save your money.
B001V7UXG2|1.0|This is a very disappointing edition. The picture quality is grainy, and the color is poor. In fact, I am going to keep my VHS tapes, which are better, and hope a good quality DVD collection of this wonderful series is one day available.
B0002XMF5I|3.0|Not a bad album, eventhough no Ozzy or Dio, Tony still proves he can write riffs for whoever sings for him.
B000HWZ5XI|5.0|In some ways MIGHTY REARRANGER can be viewed as the culmination of all of Robert Plant's previous solo albums. There's a wide range of styles - the heavy rock, the modern electronic effects, the brilliant musicianship (Plant always gets the best available) all combine to make something that's both familiar and unique. I expect Plant would say that \\"blues\\" music is at the heart of all the music he makes but I mostly just hear a very modern sounding kind of rock n' roll when I put on MIGHTY REARRANGER. I find it extremely fresh and exciting.<br /><br />\\"Another Tribe\\" - This lament for a war-torn human race features a briskly strummed acoustic guitar over Middle Eastern flavored atmospherics and a quasi-tribal drum beat. Earlier in the decade, Robert Plant participated in The Festival in the Desert in Africa which featured musicians from around the world. The influence of his experiences in Africa can clearly be heard on this record. *****+<br /><br />\\"Shine It All Around\\" - has a mysterious, almost ominous sound although it's really very spiritual and uplifting. Plant still has incredible singing chops and his multi-tracked vocals on \\"Shine\\" are otherworldly. *****+<br /><br />\\"Freedom Fries\\" - Anyone of age at the start of the most recent American invasion of Iraq will remember the bone-headed weenies who insisted on renaming \\"french fries\\" \\"freedom fries\\" because the French government did not support invading Iraq (and for damn good reasons). This straight-up hard rock song sports a jerky, chugging rhythm and typically great Plant vocals. ****<br /><br />\\"Tin Pan Valley\\" - I don't know exactly what \\"a grudge of Christian women\\" is, but this is a strange and very cool song. It begins as a subdued rocker filled with quiet tension, but then Plant sings, \\"I take the bottle to the baby/ You take the hammer to the pearl\\" and the song immediately explodes with intensity. *****+<br /><br />\\"All The Kings Horses\\" - This is an absolutely gorgeous ballad that may in fact be Plant's most beautiful one yet. It's a sweet love song with some great lines like \\"I pour myself a brand new start\\" . . . only some spare violin and acoustic guitar accompany Plant's soft, gentle vocals.  The man is so versatile, touching base with so many different styles, even creating a few of his own. *****+<br /><br />\\"The Enchanter\\" - a compelling Middle Eastern vibe with a totally hypnotic flow. Killer African beats, techno, Zeppelin, echo chambers, quiet pauses, Radiohead synths, a Native American shouting a war cry and a booming climax all combine to make this one MIGHTY REARRANGER's best track. *****+<br /><br />\\"Takamba\\" - rock n' roll with fast and loose guitar and splashy drums - the Strange Sensation is one hell of a band! *****+<br /><br />\\"Dancing In Heaven\\" - Another great song, this one is laid back, very positive and very catchy. *****<br /><br />\\"Somebody Knocking\\" - a weird, folky track featuring more fantastic African/multi-cultural drumming, speedy guitar picking and distinctive, cutting-edge sounds and effects. The offbeat rhythm soon slips into a spacey atmosphere, punctured by a furiously picked guitar riff beckoned by Plant's sung \\"come ons.\\" *****<br /><br />\\"Let the Four Winds Blow\\" - Pumped by an insistent bass, killer guitar riffs and heavy rock n' roll. Somehow it sounds familiar and original at the same time. *****<br /><br />\\"Mighty Rearranger\\" - yet another brilliant song, the title track is punctuated by some expertly played boogie piano, organ and harmonica. There's a touch of rockabilly in there too, territory Plant has visited many a time. This band is so tight! *****<br /><br /> \\"Brother Ray\\" - a nod and salute to the music of  past days - specifically the heyday of Ray Charles. A fitting tribute, this is some really old, old-school piano bar boogie blues, beautifully rendered. ****<br /><br />Bonus tracks:<br /><br />\\"Red, White & Blue\\" - A song about freedom, this is a jaunty, Johnny Cash-style chugger. ****1/2<br /><br />\\"All The Money In The World\\" - an upbeat, \\"down-&-out-but-movin'-on\\" kiss-off to a bad connection who's \\"living in a house of cards.\\" *****+<br /><br />\\"Shine It All Around (Girls Remix)\\" (7:35) - This is basically a techno remix - I'm a big sucker for this kind of thing when it's done this well. The percussion is dominated by what I think is a tabla and it's totally mind-blowing. The spacey, dubby effects are phenomenal and intense. This song is all about giving and spreading your good fortune to others. *****+<br /><br />\\"Tin Pan Valley (Girls Remix)\\" (6:20) - sounds like some stellar musicians playing with The Orb . . . Robert Plant + The Strange Sensation + high electro energy + high BPMs = one helluva track. *****+<br /><br />\\"The Enchanter (Unkle Reconstruction)\\" (6:49) - gets me dancing all over the place. Techno-hop mixed with amazing Indo-Asian percussion and super-intense atmospherics - - - but without a doubt, some of the best \\"atmospherics\\" you're ever likely to hear come from the incredible voice of the one and only Robert Plant! *****+ing in a house of cards.\\" *****+     \\"Shine It All Around (Girls Remix)\\" (7:35) - This is basically a techno remix - I'm a big sucker for this kind of thing when it's done this well.

B002GY9F9K|4.0|I know it is inferior to the book but as a TV Series it is pretty solid a few bad episodes but I think it will become better as it finds its footing.
B002RVZV9K|5.0|This is my first review, but i felt I had to add my voice to those who have said how great this dvd is.  I watched it with my husband and daughter and we were mesmerized, could easily have set through a couple more hours of hearing them talk about their roots and their music.  My daughter is a huge Zep fan so she loved the parts with Jimmy Page, but what surprised us  was how much all of us enjoyed the Edge's part.  None of us were very familiar with Jack White, and except for the fact he was definitely channeling Johhny Depp, found him interesting too.  Have ordered the dvd from Amazon because I know this is one we'll want to watch more than once.
0812973992|3.0|Every time I stopped in at Amazon, this book was recommended.  I took a look at the reviews and thought, okay, I'll take a chance and read it.  Why not!  Unfortunately, this book has left me anything but wowed.  McCann's stories (as they are a series of short interconnected stories) are not a great read!  It felt as if some of the prose, some of the descriptions were for their own sake only, and that somehow the author forgot he was writing for a reader, an audience.  We run across these types.  They are acclaimed by critics and academia, but when it comes to the true art of story telling and moving the \\"common\\" reader, they fall short.    These are not stories that moved me.  I never felt connected to the characters or the stories.  They never moved me and I never was able to internalize the story(ies).   Let me know more about Jazzlyn,  Let me know more about Corrigan, his brother and Adelita and their relationships.  We have only skimmed the surface.  Solomon, Claire, Jacob...why should I care about them?   Where is the connection between character and reader?  And the tight rope walker...????????    The book falls short and is more an exercise in creative writing than a story(ies)
B002VPE1AM|4.0|As a director, James Cameron dazzles magnificently with his green-friendly 2009 mega-opus. As his first full-fledged feature since [[ASIN:B000VS6R26 Titanic]], it's a CGI-generated extravaganza of 3-D and motion-capture technologies that overwhelms the senses. Give him credit for making a film that runs an epic-length 162 minutes without a hint of a yawn in the visual execution. However, as a screenwriter, Cameron resorts to familiar clich&eacute;s and often corny dialogue in this unwieldy amalgamation of [[ASIN:B002IKIHEG Land of the Lost]] and [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]]. Character development and original dialogue have never been his strong suits, and fortunately, these shortcomings are not as pronounced as they were with \\"Titanic\\". At the same time, I really wish he could have seen the benefit of a writing collaborator who could have made something more provocative out of the arresting science-fantasy premise and ultimately push this movie toward the echelon of being one for the ages.<br /><br />Set in 2154, the fanciful story focuses on Jake Scully, a paraplegic former Marine who has been recruited for a special mission by the U. S. Armed Forces because he's a genetic match for his dead identical twin. The mission is to Pandora, an earth-sized moon in orbit around a massive star, which gives life to minerals that the Earth needs after centuries of abuse and desecration. Pandora's native inhabitants deep in the planetary forest are the blue-skinned Na'vi, a race of slender, agile twelve-foot giants who are at one with their natural environment. In order for humans to connect with the Na'vi, avatars have been created from their DNA, which allows select humans to become Na'vi look-alikes on Pandora, while still being mind-controlled by the original humans wired up on the hovering ship. Physically, there is no difference between the avatars and the Na'vi, but their inner selves reflect a great divide in sensibilities and priorities of which only Scully seems to know how to traverse the deep spiritual chasm.<br /><br />From that premise comes the inevitable love story (Scully falls for the brave, soulful Neytiri) and of course, the equally inevitable showdown between the Na'vi and the increasingly aggressive military forces led by the gung-ho Colonel Miles Quaritch. The similarities between the peace-loving Na'vi and Native Americans are purely intentional down to the earthly wisdom and the yelping battle cries. Horses have been replaced with pterodactyl-like flying creatures with which the Na'vi connect through intriguingly sensual tubes of dancing cilia. There are other layers of allegory, but Cameron focuses more on the story's visceral thrills rather than bothering to elucidate the government's motivation behind the avatar program, especially since the program director, Dr. Grace Augustine, appears completely out of sync with the corporate-military brain trust almost from the outset. It's pretty clear that none of these nuances matter once the climactic battle occurs, a genuinely masterful sequence that brings the digital technology to a whole new level.<br /><br />For a movie like this to work, the characters are merely presented to support the action and supply a recognizable set of emotions which an audience doesn't have to think about. Toward that end, the cast is effective in a workman-like manner. Sam Worthington ([[ASIN:B001FB55HQ Terminator Salvation]]) plays Scully appropriately like a young Clint Eastwood type, never complicating the character more than Cameron allows. Zoe Salda&ntilde;a's ([[ASIN:B002HWRYJE Star Trek]]) role consists primarily of digital performance capture since her character doesn't have a human counterpart. She lends a palpable voice to Neytiri even though the Na'vi facial expressions remind me of those of the aliens at the end of [[ASIN:B000VECACG Close Encounters of the Third Kind]]. Michelle Rodriguez ([[ASIN:B002AT4K9G Fast & Furious]]) is on the sidelines playing a too-cool Marine fighter pilot, and there are predictably villainous turns by Stephen Lang as Quaritch and Giovanni Ribisi as a corporate administrator pushing relentlessly for the mining operation. Sigourney Weaver, who starred in Cameron's [[ASIN:B00012FXAE Aliens]] 23 years earlier, contributes a few, sassy scene-stealing scenes as Grace. James Horner's bombastic music score will sound familiar to \\"Titanic\\" fans down to the treacly ballad sung Celine-style by Leona Lewis. Mauro Fiore's cinematography and the elaborate production design led by Rick Carter and Robert Stromberg reflect world-class work.edictably villainous turns by Stephen Lang as Quaritch and Giovanni Ribisi as a corporate administrator pushing relentlessly for the mining operation.

B002VPDOFK|2.0|The Element of Freedom is a great album. In fact, next to Songs in A Minor, it could be the best work she's created to-date.It takes several listens before you can fully appreciate it. There is a wide variety of styles and tempos that will appeal to a broader audience. I expect \\"Distance and Time\\" as well as \\"Empire State of Mind Part II\\" to become the next singles off the album.     Previous reviewers have done an excellent job describing each tracks etc.     My review is mainly on this one point. Why 4 different versions??     Version 1: Standard 14 tracks.     Version 2: The Deluxe Edition 16 tracks including the bonus \\"Through It All\\" and the heart warming, \\"Pray for Forgiveness\\"   Also included is a second DVD disc that features 4 live acoustic tracks and the video for Doesn't Mean Anything.   Listening to these tracks makes me wish I could have them as audio ones as well. Alicia does a completely   different take on them.     Version 3: Standard 14 tracks plus \\"Stolen Moment's\\" and \\"Heaven's door\\" You can ONLY buy this version at Target or as an   expensive Japanese import.     Version 4: EMPIRE EDITION - Available only to U.S. customers (so as a Canadian fan I have no chance of ever buying it)   via Alicia's website. It has 2 cds. The first is the standard 14 tracks. The second is a 7 song ep with \\"Lover   Man\\" ( a fantastic song that is a good as any of her hit singles)and \\"Almost there\\" along with 5 other live   songs like \\"No One\\"and \\"Karma\\"     I love Alicia, I don't want to illegally rip these tracks from the net. Why can't SONY and other record companies listen to true fans and create a better product? Sad thing is that I've even emailed Sony records to no avail. If only I could write to Alicia herself?!!     This cd would have hit number 1 on Billboard if it included all these bonus tracks on the second cd along with the live dvd performances. In this day of sagging cd sales, and consumers having to be more careful how they spend their hard earned money, why not make a product that has songs, videos, exclusives all in one?
0060555661|5.0|An investor, irrespective of his philosophy will gain insight and wisdom from this writing by Graham and Zweig. A comprehensive book which requires focused and sometime repetitive reading to understand, but nevertheless is very valuable.  A must have for anyone interested in understanding financial history, stock valuation and the investment business. Excellent examples of human behavior and trends in the stock market and instructive about various manipulations and exploitations utilized to the determent of an average investor.  In retrospect, I should have started my investment understanding by reading this book first.

B001EAWME2|4.0|This is the classic 'black christmas\\"  the new version just couldn't hold a candle to this one at all.  This one had the excellent talents of director Bob Clark (rip), actresses Margot Kidder, Olivia  hussy, andrea martin , excellent acting from john saxon, art hindle and the rest of the supporting cast too.  It has a eerie movie that still shines all these years later and it's was highly influential to what would come later.  It's not as gory as movies that in five years time would be unleashed on the world; but it's still atmospheric and creepy as hell.  This isn't a superfast moving slasher flick , it has strong character buildup and is not a body county movie either. Those types of movies are fine though.  The transfer needed some work but I had no synch problems at all. The vocals matched completely and are not a problem.  The films natural grain is really brought forth and the print needed some color restoration work particularily on black scenes.  Still there are no lines, cuts or specks.  But in comparison to many horror movies from that era that look spiced and diced this print is very decent.  Some grain and off coloring is nothing in comparison to the hideously destroyed prints that many dvd's have of movies released from the seventies.  All in all I would recommend this blu ray version if you accept that the hd process is going to bring out the grain really highly. It does this on any movie though; even 24 season 7 in dark scenes on blu ray the grainy film effect is amplified.  However I am glad I got to see this classic horror movie on blu.  That being said they STILL need to remaster this one and lower the grain in some scenes.  ( I doubt this will ever be done though whcih is a shame, they could color restore it too) ANd the director of this was killed in a car accident so that doesn't help either in that regard.
B001N1DPDE|5.0|This knife is amazing!  I was able to cut through carpet with it, chopped down a tree, and was still able to do other cutting tasks.  It is everything I expected and more!  Very easy to clean, and doesn't easily rust like other past purchases.  It's a bit bulky for finer cutting, but for heavy duty tasks, it's a winner!
B001AVCFK6|5.0|well to start is a blu-ray for only $19.99!!! thats a steal to begin with! it also came with a digital copy of the movie as well. it shipped pretty quickly and made a great christmas gift to my father.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|We Americans think that something is going on between Washington and Wall Street. We think something is going on between Washington and Oil Companies. We think. We think. But there isn't much we can do and there doesn't seem to be anyone willing to connect the dots and hold people accountable. What I didn't realize was that our food was another area where Washington and powerful companies are basically conspiring to control us. Things like the soy bean market being cornered by Monsanto and the stripping of the powers of the FDA are shocking! And those are only two of the long series of issues that this film illuminates.<br /><br />I'd never read any of the books that are cited in this film, but love a good documentary (via Netflix streaming,) and when this one showed up with high ratings I had to watch it. What I found was a documentary that shows just how ignorant we Americans are. I know that after watching this film I am going to pay far closer attention to where my food comes from and buy local when I can. I also found that even though I was very hungry today, the thought of eating fast food made my stomach churn. If you wonder why, watch the film. I highly recommend that you do.
B002C39TU0|5.0|I own an original copy of the 1986 Sire pressing and compared it to my new remastered disc, and - making allowances for the age of the original vinyl (but clean and not abused) - the remastered pressing blows it out of the water. The disc is considerably heavier and stiffer than the condoms Sire records passed off as vinyl in the \\"good old days\\". I do have one complaint that I have posed to the seller, however - and i expect a resolution soon: The new disc was warped. Not like a potato chip, but noticeable. In addition, both sides, but especially side 2 was pressed off center, which causes a wooble as the pitch goes up and down. I have placed my comment to the seller and hope to have it replaced rather than the money refunded as this is an excellent album and manufacturing defects occur from time to time. The LP is made in the USA. I wonder if I would have had better luck if i would have bought the same album as a UK or German import.
006135323X|5.0|Book report: Predictably Irrational, by Dan Ariely    Read this book!    Oh, you want reasons? Well, there's the interesting thing. So much of our world is based on reasons, reason, and rationality. We depend on people to vote, behave, drive, buy, and invest in rational ways. Economics is based on people behaving rationally. Yet, we know that we - or, at least, other people - are not rational. What behavioral economist Dan Ariely and others have discovered is that, not only are people irrational, but they are predictably irrational. That is, their irrationality follows regular patterns that can be measured, understood, mastered - and manipulated by those in the know.     Here's an example. Suppose a real estate agent shows you two houses, a colonial-style and a ranch-style. You find it hard to decide between them, because it's difficult to compare two such different styles of houses. Then, the agent shows you another house, also a colonial, but not as nice as the first one. Now, you can make up your mind: the first colonial now seems much better than not only the inferior colonial, but the ranch also. Why is this? Because our brains find it much easier to make relative comparisons, that is comparisons between similar items, than comparisons between different items. By introducing this third house, which should be irrelevant to a rational choice between the first two, the agent is subtly using our irrationality to influence us.    Ariely describes dozens of extremely clever experiments that he and other researchers have done with real people that illustrate the principles he discusses. The experiments are fascinating in themselves, and the results even more so. You will learn a lot about how people act, and act irrationally, from this book.    You will also learn about yourself. Yes, as much as you think yourself a rational person, I know that at least one of these scenarios will strike very close to home, and help you to understand how you sometimes also think irrationally. This is good: it helps us learn more about ourselves, and how our minds work, and how we can keep ourselves from being fooled by our own minds.     Among the fascinating questions he raises are: Why do we value free items so highly, even when accepting them is actually harmful? Why is it better to decide your meal order before the waitperson arrives, rather than listen to others in your party order first? Why do medicines that are more expensive work better than cheap ones? Why do placebos work at all? Does it matter who you bring with you when you go out to meet members of the opposite sex? Why do we overvalue what we already own? Why are we sometimes honest and sometimes dishonest? And what's a simple way to make people act more honestly? Can we trust ourselves - or anyone - to do the right thing in emotional situations? And, if not, how can we plan for those situations in advance?    As you can see, such questions are important not only in personal matters, but also in government, economics, medicine, law, and ethics. Understanding how we approach these matters both rationally and irrationally can help our world work better.    But just because these are important questions doesn't mean that this is a ponderous or pontificating book. On the contrary, Ariely is a delightful storyteller and guide to these issues. He has a light and engaging writing style that explains everything well, but without unnecessary jargon or pedantry. His examples are down to earth and of real practical value. I also found myself laughing out loud many times. How many books about behavior achieve that?    If you have any interest in human behavior, the way that people reach decisions, or how you yourself may act irrationally at times, you will enjoy this book.     How are those for reasons?    BTW, to get a sample of his ideas, watch this brief talk that Ariely gave at TED:  [...]
B000H6SXMY|4.0|After reading the bad reviews here I was a bit concerned about ordering this but went ahead- figuring if there was a problem I'd immediately return it. It appears that some of the worst reviews here are for an older bootleg copy not purchased directly thru Amazon.  Anyway, after my wife opened it (xmas gift), I went thru each disc to make sure they were all there and not damaged. They were all there (per labeling), but at least half had some sort of a rub or scratch on the play side.  Most of the flaws were minor rubs, scuffs, or scratches, but two had short but deep appearing scratches.  We watched the DVD with the largest scratch first and it played fine so the others should be ok.    The four stars is because of the discs being damaged: putting DVDs in a tight-fitting cardboard sleeve is a terrible idea; why not just package them between pieces of bark? I don't expect, or want, 20 of the book style opening plastic cases like you get single/double DVDs in, but they could've put the discs in soft lined CD/DVD envelopes.  If the single season discs are better packaged and not much more $ you might want to get them instead, but for $100 at the time for the box set I took the chance.
B002GY9F9K|5.0|Yes, I know that the television series is not the same as the book.  Did anyone really expect it to be?  I knew that there would be changes.  I mean, there are 11 books in the series, all with Stephen King length wording.  And yes, I was so entralled with them, that I read the first 10 in two weeks.  I just couldn't put them down.      I didn't even know that the series had started on TV, and when I saw the first season, I bought it.  I just watched the entire season, Friday night through Sat (gotta love no commercials).  Loved it.  The actors/actresses are portraying the characters of the story just as I had imagined them.  Although, I did expect Richard to be more bulky and taller.  But I'm not complaining.  Craig Horner is hot.  Bridget Regan playing Kahlan is exactly as I had pictured her.  Jessica Marais (Denna) does so good at being bad, it's scary.  Bruce Spence is funny and brings out the light humor of Zedd from the books.  Craig Parker going from elf (LOTR) to wizard/evil dude, still hot.    I know that anyone reading this, has many reviews to pick from that will tell you all the good things that I would.  I won't keep repeating them.  I will say this... Haven't read the books, doesn't matter.  The show starts out a little on the cheesy side, but shapes up beautifully, and I think will have a cult following for a long time.  I know one of them will be me.
B001PA0FFO|4.0|Excellent acting by all three stars enlivens this drama about a priest possibly involved in sexual abuse of a young teen. Merrill Streep, the middle-aged Sister Aloysius is principal of a Catholic school in the Bronx some time in the early 1960s. Philip Seymour Hoffman is Father Brendan, the parish priest who may possibly be abusing a teenage student. Amy Adams is Sister James, the young neophyte nun who wants to believe good about everybody but begins to develop doubts.<br /><br />The backdrop to the movie which uses authentic locations (it was shot in playwright and director John Patrick Shanley's own neighborhood and school) as well as the recurrent image of swirling leaves and the dark dull interiors lend an atmosphere of gloom.<br /><br />Streep gives a wonderful performance as a nun who has seen a good bit of the world. She had previously been married and widowed, we learn, before taking the veil. She is deliberately tough and down-to-earth. She is committed to fighting the priest. Seymour Hoffman portrays him as all too human, basically a decent sort with a specific weakness. Adams is all incredulity. Her character is the least nuanced and complicated but she delivers it well.<br /><br />The dialogue is often riveting and I found myself engrossed in the story. But the final climax where Sister Aloysius goes through her own personal crisis I found overly theatrical and not convincing. Of course, she acts up a storm -- but it is not authentic.<br /><br />This is an important but not disastrous flaw in a fine movie.
B002PMV9K6|5.0|Although it does not get as indepth as the story in the 6th book, the 6th movie was very well done and out of all that are out, I found to be my favorite.
055380684X|5.0|Loved Loved Loved this book!!!    It's very easy to follow--  sort of  like a well written and engaging research paper.    Personally, it got me really excited about practice. Lets face it-- we all hope to be natural at things that seem interesting to us- be it hobbies, work etc. This book demystifies \\"natural talent\\" and allows the reader to understand that success takes  hours of deep practice. And deep practice lets you build Myelin. In order to build more Myelin, you need to get really excited about failing and trying again. And for me, this book is a catalyst for wanting to try and try again until I succeed at things that I thought I couldn't do before.    So read it and start building that Myelin!
B001TODCII|5.0|one of my favorites movies worth watching and owning a good action flick liam neeson plays a ex black ops operator (at least thats what i figured he was) and father whos daughter has been taken by a group to sell her into slavery...he uses everything he knows to find her and bring her back, hes a ruthless s.o.b who dosnt care who gets hurt or killed to find his daughter...almost no stop action once you get past the first 10 mins or so...
0399215921|3.0|The story is ok--my daughter seems to enjoy it at 17 months of age. However, the book itself is tiny. If you want this book, I'd suggest finding it in a regular format  and not the miniature version.
0395389496|5.0|I love this book and used it when I was teaching elementary school many years ago.  Now, I have my own children and read them this book during the Christmas season.  The book is beautifully done both in the storyline and in the pictures. The art work is exquisite and leads to great discussions with the little ones sitting on your lap or around you as you go through the book.  Linger as you read it and really look at the pictures.  It is one to enjoy over and over.

B002P5XXR0|5.0|When James & James (Horner & Cameron) collaborate result can't be nothing short of fantastic! Music is very important part of Avatar movie and Horner managed to get the emotions right. From start to finish this is beautiful musical journey through the movie. It is hard to pick some tracks because this is one body but opening track is one of my favorites, mood is just fantastic as we arrive to mystic world of Pandora, to which we are introduced through beautiful tracks of 'Jake Enters His Avatar World' and 'Pure Spirits Of The Forest'. The most beautiful moment of the score comes at 1.55min mark of 4th track 'The Bioluminescence Of The Night'! Oh, that is just incredible piece of music. Main theme of the movie, which is present in many tracks at certain moments, is very beautiful. First two notes remind of Titanic but after that it goes its own way. Mid section of the score is happy, as is the movie, while Jake gets to know the Na'vi, and 'Climbing Up Iknimaya - The Path To Heaven' and 'Jake's First Flight' shine here! Than comes the sad and dramatic part of the score in which you feel the drama through 'Scorched Earth' and 'Quaritch' and pain of Na'vi through 'Destruction of the Hometree' and 'Shutting Down Grace's Lab'. In the later battle part of the score 'War' is just amazing track, so beautiful and so bombastic at the same moment, love those drums which shake my room. All in all Avatar score is one incredible journey from start to finish, and I can't get enough of it since I first laid my ears on it. Hope it will get deserved Oscar!
031606792X|1.0|From all of the hype of this series I expected a well written vampire story. While the books do have some good parts and they do get better towards the 4th book, it was such a disappointment. The story is so bland and I can only see it appealing to 10-15 year old girls. Too bad the movies are not any better.    Don't waste your money, go buy Harry Potter.
B002RSDW80|4.0|I saw this movie a week ago and Meryl Streep as Julia Child is still on my mind - STILL IN MY MIND!      If you think you've seen Meryl do everything you really haven't until you see her performance in this movie.  She is absolutely superb in the difficult role of someone we all knew so well.  In the hands of a lesser actress, the very mannered Julia would have come off as a foolish parody.  Streep infuses her performance with every detail of Julia's joy and spirit.      Norah Ephron has brought Julie Powell's book to life - the story of modern day Julie finding her voice by writing a blog about cooking every recipe in Julia Child's ground breaking book, Mastering the Art of French Cooking.  At the same time we experience Julia Child's self discovery in post-war Paris studying the culinary arts and writing her book, based on her recollections in the book, My Life in France.     Ephron expertly contrasts the two eras of the leading characters who never meet, although Ms. Child was alive at the time.  You will be happy to know that Ms. Child's 6'2\\" stature is believably recreated.     Besides Ms. Streep, there is also the fine performance of Stanley Tucci as Paul Child.    What I didn't like was the character of modern day Julie. Her scenes are very weak compared to the Paris scenes with Julia.  Amy Adams does what she can with the role, but Julie is a mousy, put-upon and passive bore who is not interesting enough to carry her part of the story.  The overacting of Chris Messina as her scruffy husband is distracting.    Note that on this DVD the sound is poorly mixed and requires constant increasing and lowering of the volume.     Finally, this is NOT a guy movie although guys can still enjoy it.  I sense surprise from some of the reviewers here.

B002ZTQVGQ|5.0|This film has been well summarized and reviewed so let me keep this personal...    I have been a fan of Miyazaki's work for more years than most folks in the states have known he existed.  Like most fans I thought the peak of his artistic achievements were Princess Mononoke and Spirited Away.  However after having children and rearing them to the age that I thought it worthwhile to begin exposing them to these films (my boy is 6 and my twin girls are 4) I have found a new dimension by which to judge these films.  This new dimension is the simplicity of the stories being told and how well their message can be absorbed by young children.  What I have found is that Miyazaki's genius runs deeper than I had originally thought in my art snob anime days.  The genius is in the simplicity of some of his stories and how well he is able to strike the balance wherein a story is palatable to younger viewers (4-6) but no less relevant for an adult viewer.  And when looking through his body of work you can often find that love for the beauty in simplicity in the worlds he creates.  These are simple stories that take place in a larger fantastic world, and all the intricacies of that world need not be explained ad nauseum to the view, we are there for the story and must simply accept the fantastic and magical elements within that story without weighty explanations.      Ponyo on the Cliff by the Sea is a perfect example of a simple story that is told in a way that is both poignant and beautiful to behold.  The story is well explained in other reviews so I will leave those bits out and say simply that it is a joy to watch for the whole family and after multiple viewings with the children I find myself just as drawn to the screen as they are.  The story lacks the complexity and maturity of Princess Mononoke because it doesn't require it.  The characters are bright and lovably innocent though they exist in an imperfect world were parents have many responsibilities and sometimes can't make it to dinner because of work.  Sosuke is a brave and mature little boy whom you can tell has been shaped that way by the adversities of his family life.  For me the character demonstrates that even in a family where work requires much of the parents time that the love they exhibit and express to their child makes up for raising him in an imperfect situation, which I feel is a theme in many other of Miyazaki's stories such as My Neighbor Totoro.  Ponyo is vibrant and always excited in the new world of possibilities that she has found above the water, and though she inadvertently causes some havoc in the world around her, her good natured frolicking tends to make you forget that she is the cause of most of the stories upheaval.    As in most of Miyazaki's stories there is no true antagonist and the conflict is limited mostly to the natural fallout of Ponyo's transformation.  This however does not take away from the story in my opinion as is usually the case with these movies.  Miyazaki's movies typically end in a spirit of resolution and understanding rather than victory over an enemy which I feel is a great lesson for the kids to understand the concept of moral ambiguity and trying to resolve conflicts through understanding rather than the violent destruction of an uncompromising evil.    Pony has definitely become the favorite movie for now in the house and the kids cannot stop watching it and after having it a few weeks I find myself no less impressed by its charm and of course its visually stunning animation.  I would recommend all of Miyazaki's work to anyone young or old but in particular I would recommend this for houses with younger children as your experience will be enhanced by observing them as they take in all the visuals of this wonderful fantasy story (And be sure to sing along with them to \\"Ponyo, Ponyo, little fishy in the sea..\\").  If you enjoy Ponyo I would strongly recommend you follow it closely with \\"The Cat Returns\\" and \\"My Neighbor Totoro\\"

While the idea of Jacob imprinting on Renesmee seems a little lame, i ended up suspending disbelief--after all, i had just committed to a series of books about teenage vampire love--and loved it.

055380684X|5.0|If you have children or grandchildren, this is the book for you.  Simple things, such as saying you really worked hard rather than you really are smart, make a huge difference in how successful children become at anything, from sports to academic accomplishments.  The book is full of hints like this and an easy-to-understand explanation of how to be successful at your chosen activity.  These hints apply to all ages.  After reading it, I had to purchase copies to send to others.
075695195X|5.0|The trilogy is incredible -- both for teens and adults. The talent to write and storytell this well is a true blessing. It's a story about magic, adventure, deception, mystery...and above all there is so much humor and sarcastic humor. Just make sure you read ALL the footnotes -- it is worth it. It was hard for me when I finiehed the last of the 3 books -- my life felt empty because the series had completely engulfed my mind, emotions and soul. Like I said, it is a series that is not to be missed.
1400067936|4.0|If you want read a book that challenges the way that you perceive the world then this book has to be recommended. Nassim Taleb has a unique perspective on the world that should make most people sit up, take notice and ask why.<br /><br />It is also probably a book that needs to be read more than once to really extract the essence of the ideas simply because they are so different from the main stream. The books is well written and easy to read but can invoke challenging thought at times.<br /><br />We live in a world where we seek to manage the expected and routine however Taleb masterfully demonstrates that the unexpected and unpredictable are what really has the greatest impact on our lives. From financial markets to careers the unpredictable and unexpected are major influencers of the outcome yet we not only tend to overlook their impact and ignore then all together. This book provides you with a unique insight into this hidden world which is almost always right in front of us.<br /><br />If you want a book that will challenge the way that think about the world around you, then this is one of those books
0545123267|3.0|SHIVER is one of the most unique takes on the werewolf-human love story that I've read. (Granted, I haven't read many of them.) The cold world that the werewolves exist in is multifaceted, fascinating, and slightly frightening too. Maggie's writing is lyrical yet accessible, making Grace and Sam's world and romance all the more poignant.<br /><br />However, there was just something about SHIVER that wasn't my thing, that I couldn't get completely into. Was it how I never connected with Sam and Grace, never felt the intensity and veracity of their feelings for one another? Was it the way that all the secondary characters were drawn two-dimensionally? I don't know. I don't see anyone else having this problem. Maybe it is just me.<br /><br />It's a fascinating concept and some great writing, but together, it wasn't quite working for me. I didn't feel a desperate desire to find out what happens to the characters, even though I did shed a tear or two near the end (what can I say? Great writing does that to you). I encourage you to go out and pick this one up, and then make of it what you will.
B000W91RUG|5.0|I couldn't believe that this sitcom is on DVD, what a nice surprise. I wasn't even looking for it and there it was. Over the holidays, I purchased the complete first and second season sets as a gift to myself. All of the cast members do a superb job and I love the intelligent humor. This is a well thought out sitcom and I hope it enjoys a long run.    I noticed that at the end of every episode there is journal of the producers thoughts. It flashes by really quick so you have to pause it to read it. Only problem is that the text is really small and not very clear. That's a shame because the ones that I had the patience to squint through to read are interesting. Great show.

If you are familiar with Lua then you know something about the clean and elegant aspects of the language.  If you have looked through the Lua source code, you will have seen that same elegance and clarity.  This book is no different.  The reader is led through all the necessary aspects of the language and libraries, and covers a surprising amount of material.    It reminded me of Kernighan and Ritchie's The C Programming Language so much that I expect to buy another copy when someone walks off with this one.

1400063736|3.0|I bought this book because of all the good reviews. I didn't think it lived up to those reviews. I finished the book but it was not one of my favorites of 2009. The book had several characters going at once that the author tried to connect to one event but I didn't feel the connection.

I only got the DVD's, when it was supposed to also come with a bunch of extra booklets and other small pull-outs. Overall, the movie is great and I highly recommend it, but I was disappointed with the lack of the extras I was supposed to receive.
0307474275|4.0|I just read \\"The Da Vinci Code\\", and my friend was right that I would finish the thriller in one day.  Maybe I'm just picky, but the book is chalk full of mistakes, including (spoiler alert!),<br /><br />1. Godfroi de Bouillon was never the King of France.<br /><br />2. The scene where Sophie walks in on her grandfather at his chateau describes all the parked high end German cars.  However, those in positions of power in France drive either Renault 605's or Citroen C 5's.  In fact, this would be a requirement for executives of government institutions, which her grandfather and other s&eacute;n&eacute;chauds presided over.<br /><br />3. The number of apostles in Da Vinci's Last Supper is the right number (12).  The apostle to the right of Christ is St. John the Evangelist, which is true for countless surviving Last Supper's and Calvary depictions from the High Middle Ages in both painting and sculpture.  Because St. John always has long hair and is the youngest as well as the only un-bearded apostle, there is naturally a heightened contrast with the other apostles (old, bearded, and some bald).<br /><br />In addition, since he was Christ's favorite apostle, obvious signs of consolatory affection are often depicted between the two.  In any case, Da Vinci's St. John looks no more effeminate then those of 15th Century German sculptures, for example.  And of course, if St. John is now said to be Mary Magdalene, then where is the twelfth apostle, which one of them would be missing, and why?<br /><br />4. That Da Vinci created anagrams of the words \\"Mona Lisa\\" is ridiculous since, a) Da Vinci didn't speak English  and b) the painting is not called the Mona Lisa in Italy, France, etc.  In Spanish, \\"Mona Lisa\\" literally means \\"Smooth Monkey\\"!<br /><br />5. In Da Vinci's \\"Madonna on the Rocks\\", St. John the Baptist is clearly the one on the left because his is bigger and older.  Since John was nearly a year older than Jesus, he is always shown larger when the two are depicted together as children.  This is a convention throughout the canon of High Gothic/Renaissance Art, independent of other attributes.<br /><br />6. The abundant rose symbolism in Gothic cathedrals, stems from the cult of the Virgin Mary.  There is no need to \\"promote\\" Mary Magdalene to the role of (feminine) symmetrical opposite of Christ because that role was already fulfilled in the Middle Ages by the Virgin.  Every cathedral in Europe was dedicated to a saint, and in France, fully half of all cathedrals were dedicated to the Virgin.  The rose was one of the many symbols associated with her.  Thanks to the importance of the Virgin Mary, the roots of Feminism could take hold in Europe, allowing a succession of powerful women such as Hildegard Von Bingen, Marie de France, Eleonor of Aquitaine, etc. -- which never occurred in Islam, for example, perhaps due to its lack of feminine role models in the Koran.<br /><br />7. The \\"promotion\\" of Mary Magdalene to wife of Jesus from \\"mere whore\\" in reality deprives Christianity of one of its most important contributions; namely, the notion of \\"redemption\\".  In the Old Testament, sinners are punished, full stop.  The New Testament introduces the idea that wrong doers can be redeemed (another innovation lacking in Islam).<br /><br />8. The book says that the Knights Templar spent months living hard and digging around \\"the ruins of Solomon's Temple\\" looking for the Holy Grail.  In fact, the impressive and still standing Dome of the Rock (Al Aqsa) Mosque had already been built by then:  thus the area was far from being a ruin.  The Knights Templar installed themselves in the Dome because it was \\"in your face\\" to the Muslims, was on good commanding high ground, and provided all the comforts of a palace.<br /><br />9. It was Phillip IV of France who gave the order to have the Templar Knights arrested, not Pope Clement V.  And this well planned, simultaneous operation occurred only in France, not in all of Europe.<br /><br />10. The book implies that the Dead Sea Scrolls contain rejected New Testament gospels.  In fact, the Dead Sea Scrolls contain very little that can be directly cross-referenced to the New Testament.<br /><br />But I still had fun reading it -- it was a perfectly good waste of a few hours!Scrolls contain very little that can be directly cross-referenced to the New Testament.

0143038419|1.0|The book has some decent moments, but overall it is banal, narcissistic, and self-indulgent.  There are better travel stories to be had, and much better personal growth chronicles.  Note to author: there's a big difference between self-reflection and self-absorption.

Adults enjoy it and it's safe to take the kids--a rare combo in this day and age. Bittersweet, funny, exciting. I laughed, I cried, it moved me.    The nice extra is the digital copy, and this is why I bought this particular edition. You can load it on your computer and then play it, in my case, on my iPod, iPhone, etc via a download from the iTunes store. And the price for all of this at Amazon, at least when I bought it just before Christmas, is less than the prices at brick and mortar stores for the edition without the digital copy. What a deal.

1416572287|4.0|Quantum mechanics is a tough subject, and an easy way for frauds like Deepak Chopra and Gary Zukav to screw around with the heads of the uninitiated -- after all,  in a subject so persistently weird and barely comprehensible, it's very easy to make up a line of BS that sounds sort of plausible to a mark desperate for abundant wealth and/or health. The fact that public perception of QM is still focused on the Copenhagen interpretation and Schrödinger's Cat really doesn't help matters -- \\"quantum\\" has become a buzzword for \\"anything goes. Physics professor and blogger Chad Orzel, of ScienceBlogs' Uncertain Principles, has decided to start with his dog, who apparently has a problem with evil squirrels selling free energy schemes.    Emmy the German Shepherd mix is an amusing character -- voraciously curious, territorial, and as much a hustler as you'd expect any housepet to be. Orzel's \\"conversations\\" generally start out with Emmy using half-understood principles of quantum physics to her advantage (usually in a manner that involves trying to catch rabbits or get rid of the evil squirrels, though at one point invoking Schrödinger's Cat to scam an extra treat out of her owner). All the way through, Orzel plays the patient teacher, explaining how the things Emmy half-understands actually works, or, in many cases, probably work. There's a fair amount of math, but anyone with a decent handle on algebra should be able to get the bulk of it. (If you're using it as a study guide for a test, though, don't skimp on your calculus.)     Orzel's conceit is perhaps not particularly original, but it follows in the well-trodden quasi-Socratic footsteps of books like [[ASIN:0521447712 Mr Tompkins]], [[ASIN:0465026567 Godel, Escher, Bach]], and [[ASIN:0387989161 The Planiverse]], and it's definitely a credit to the genre. More advanced science students might find it a bit fluffy and even elementary (Orzel's explicit handwaving of the multiple QM interpretations out there might proveto be an irritant) but overall, this book is more than sufficient to teach you enough to keep the Choprawoo at bay.
0307269981|4.0|I read \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" in late September and just finished this second book in the series a couple of days ago. I tend to enjoy thriller/suspense novels but it's not my primary genre and I may only read ten or so a year.<br /><br />This book is really, really good - but not quite as good as the first one. I loved \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" and was a little worried that this second one wouldn't hold up and I was wrong. Mikael Blomkvist finds himself in the situation of discovering the bodies of two of his friends/co-workers and a woman he has been involved with previously (both professionally and personally) is the primary suspect. The police zeroed in on Lisbeth Salander pretty quickly as the killer and a handful of people who know her are very suspicious that she is capable of this. The fact she disappears makes it hard to clear her name and also reinforces her guilt with the authorities.<br /><br />As with the previous novel, the character development for writing of this type is very good. The characters are well developed and the reader finds himself caring about what happens to them. The action is fast-paced in sections though there are times when it dragged a bit, but those slower sections allows the reader a chance to catch his breath which isn't necessarily a bad thing.<br /><br />Two things I would mention to anyone contemplating this book -<br /><br />1) Pretty raw in places with violence that could be upsetting to some.<br />2) It would be much better to go back and read \\"Girl with the Dragon Tattoo\\" before reading this if you haven't already done so. To appreciate the book, the background is incredibly helpful.<br /><br />As I was reading this book over the period of several days, I found myself not sleeping as well as normal. I found I needed to read something else directly before bed rather than this in order to get a good night's sleep --

B002LIZWTI|5.0|This is an amazing EP which I listen to quite frequently. One of my favorite pieces of music from the decade. And I've had the privilege to see this inspiring band live many times and they are wonderful..   \\"Stars\\" is beautifully ambient that puts you into a dream-like haze.  \\"Elephants\\" is a great up-tempo song that makes you want to dance with your shadow.  \\"Billie Holiday\\"s a pretty acoustic ballad that transforms into Mary Wells' \\"My Guy\\". Beautifully done, Warpaint makes it their own, giving it new life.  \\"Beetles\\" is pure magic. Starting off as a dance-song with heavy rhythm, soon morphing into a hypnotic break with haunting vocals and starting right back into making you want to shake your ass again. Perfectly executed.  Then, their is \\"Burgundy\\" with it's intro that makes you feel like you've been transported into the Ethers. Maybe, my favorite song on this EP.. Just amazing.  \\"Krimson\\" is the cherry on top. Hypnotizing you with a wonderful intro that transforms into another great 'shake your ass' song.   Overall, I think this EP is brilliant and cannot wait for Warpaint's full-length album.
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I do not recall reading a more beautifully written novel.  Diane Setterfield clearly demonstrates exceptional mastery with The Thirteenth Tale.<br /><br />The setting is often dark and wet.  Knowing that the story takes place in the English countryside, it's critical to the 'color palette.'<br /><br />It's acceptable that the author has omitted certain facts, such as the era, because many other details are so craftfully painted.  The problem of this was that I was able to visualize the setting and the faces of the characters, but couldn't see their clothing.<br /><br />The story has its weaknesses, in my opinion, and sub-plots which I can not fathom.  Believable and feasible stories are important to me as a reader, but this book forces one to suspend lots of rationale.  Despite that, I finished it in just a few days and have often thought of the characters since.  The novel concludes with some of the loose ends tied up, but others flapping in the breeze.<br /><br />I found this book to be enjoyable; I liked it and recommend it, but wouldn't necessarily put it at the top of your reading list.<br /><br />Enjoy your trip to Yorkshire!
0756655307|5.0|I've always been a fan of Marvel Comics since I was a child growing up in the 60's that's when Marvel's modern incarnation came out,and before  it was Atlas Comics.

B0007Y08QA|4.0|I had forgotten how good this movie was until my wife and I watched it again the other night.  The story follows Trevor Reznik (Christian Bale), a machinist (natch) who hasn't slept for a year.  He also apparently hasn't eaten, as Reznik looks like he spent some serious time in a concentration camp (Taking method acting perhaps a step too far, Bale actually lost a dangerous amount of weight to play the role).  We follow Reznik's life as he moves from his job to his apartment, to the hooker (Jennifer Jason Lee) he visits, to the airport diner where his favorite waitress Marie (Aitana S&aacute;nchez-Gij&oacute;n) works.  As the film progresses, Reznik's world begins to degenerate into a surreal paranoia, beginning when a co-worker (Michael Ironside) loses an arm in a machine Reznik accidentally activates after being distracted by a another co-worker, Ivan, whose existence is repeatedly denied by the other characters in the film.  As Reznik searches for clues to this mystery, the answers threaten to shatter his perception of reality.<br /><br />The principle actors in the film all are very convincing, especially Christian Bale, who looks seriously haunted in this picture.  His Reznik is a walking bruise on the screen.  John Sharian as Ivan, the mystery man with the disfigured hand is also a compelling screen presence.  The visuals are dark and gritty, from the industrial machine shop Reznik spends his days to the cramped and grimy apartment he doesn't sleep in.  The action is slow developing, but it builds in intensity as the plot progresses and Reznik slips ever closer to the edge of endurance.  This is a nice creepy psychological thriller, well worth watching.

Kiefer Sutherland does a great job as well.<br /><br />Watch it and then you see what many of the recent Vampire pieces (Twilight, Blade, Vampire Diaries, Eclipse, New Moon, Buckets of Blood 1 and 2 etc) took away from it.

If you have not heard any of Regina's work, I highly recommend it - very free and easy going with great beats that keep you tapping your feet....eet eet eet....;)
0743201140|4.0|The authors identify two principles they believe guide the world's best managers: (1) Each person's talents are enduring and unique, and (2) each person's greatest room for improvement is in the areas of his or her greatest strength.  It is a forceful point, if perhaps exaggerated.  Differentiation through playing to your strengths, a STAND-OUT! strategy, can for sure be a strategy for success, but a low-cost strategy is also a proven alternative. And their dismissal of what I call a SHARPEN-ACT! strategy, whereby you work on your weaknesses in order to remain in the game, is not wholly fair. Individuals, unlike corporations, may not find themselves in the right circumstances to be able to play wholly to their strengths. Working on weaknesses may not yield them stunning success, but it could well enable them to keep their job and improve their lot.

031606792X|2.0|First off, the only reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is that I am clearly not the intended reader. The twilight series isn't written with men in mind. If I were a teenage girl I probably would love these books.   I was extremely disappointed by the end of this series. It spends a good chunk of the book gearing you up for a fight that never happens. A lot of time was spent explaining all the different abilities different vampires have, just so the big battle could be canceled at the end.  It feels like a huge waste of time.
B001OQCV60|2.0|**1/2<br /><br />Well, what do you know?  Guy Ritchie has gone all high-tech and mega-budget on our arses in \\"Sherlock Holmes,\\" the umpteenth movie incarnation of the world's most famous literary detective.<br /><br />As embodied by Robert Downey Jr., this Holmes is no brandy-sniffing, pipe-smoking effete intellectual, spending his time peering at clues through an enlarged magnifying-glass, but rather a rough-and-tumble, athletic bad boy who boxes in his spare time, swan dives into the Thames to escape a villain, and performs more acts of death-defying derring-do than 007 on a busy day.  In this installment, Holmes is locked in mortal combat with the dreaded Lord Blackburn, a murderous cult leader who miraculously returns from the dead after being hanged for his crimes.  Jude Law plays Dr. Watson, Holmes' friend, confidante and personal physician, who is thinking of dissolving their crime-fighting partnership in favor of blessed domesticity in the form of marriage to one Mary Morstan (Kelly Reilly).  Rounding out the cast is Rachel McAdams as Holmes' one true love who just happens to be entangled in Blackburn's nefarious schemes.<br /><br />As written by Robert Michael Johnson, Anthony Peckham and Simon Kinberg, \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" is long and loud and filled with enough explosions and detonations to keep the most restless 21st Century action movie fan rooted firmly to his seat.  But all the stunt work and pyrotechnics are ultimately wasted in the service of one of those trite and tiresome plot-to-take-over-the-world scenarios that have become practically de rigueur in the world of big budget spectaculars these days.  The Victorian Era period detail is nice, but it would have been a great deal nicer had cinematographer Philippe Rousselot seen fit to crank up the lighting a notch or two so we might actually be able to SEE some of it (hopefully, this flaw will be rectified in the DVD version).<br /><br />That leaves us pretty much with the acting, which is dependably good given the caliber of the players involved.

0061120073|5.0|A tree grows in Brooklyn was a pleasant read for a classic.  By saying that I mean that some of the classics we have read in the past have just been hard reads - hard to understand and hard to get into.  This books writing was smooth and I could follow the story easily.  The book is centered around Francie and her family in the back drop of World War One.  Told from the perspective of Francie, I quickly was engrossed in the absolute and utter level of poverty they were.<br /><br />Food is a big theme in this book and while they had very little, Francie's mom Katie could work wonders with it.  There is always stale bread and crushed pies, and bone marrow to spread on bread as a treat after the bone has been used in soups.  Meat was a rare treat.  This book reminded me a bit of The Book Thief as far as the poverty and making the best of what they have.<br /><br />I enjoyed the theme of the book, yet found it for the most part non eventful.  The book goes page by page through Francie's life, what she sees in her parents (her dad drinks too much and her mom works hard cleaning homes to make ends meet).  You see Francie is school and you learn her love for books and for learning.  The book carries you through Francie's life and through this I see comparable to the tree that grows outside their home... the tree seems to represent Francie - strong and yet with struggles, continuing to grow.<br /><br />A Tree Grows In Brooklyn was published in 1943. The book sold 300,000 copies in the first six weeks after it was published.  How amazing is that!  I find it astonishing that I have never read this book before.  This as well as most of the other greats were never required reading in our local schools.

B002C6K7N0|5.0|I was a bit unsure about this album as I peeled off the wrapper and stickers, but as soon as I popped the album into my home theater's DVD player, all of my fears went away....completely.  From start to finish, this album kept the pressure pretty high.  From the instrumental intro, (reminiscent of 'Into The Lungs of Hell', but at the same time, it's own beast), straight into 'This Day We Fight', you could tell that the Mustaine we all knew was still there.  Every track keeps you mesmerized.<br /><br />  Chris Broderick, formerly of Jag Panzer, is pretty much the best thing to happen to this band since Marty Freidman.  Perhaps EVER.  His leads sear, and twist with such virtuosity, that you would swear he is a clone composite made up of the DNA of the finest metal guitar players to walk the earth.  The solo work on this album is amazing.<br /><br />  Stand out tracks, in my opinion, are: 'Endgame', 'This is How the Story Ends', and '44 Minutes', but I cannot for the life of me, think of one song here that isn't worth your time.  Check out the track sampler, and I think you'll agree.<br /><br />Up The Irons!

No one can do it better than Mitch Albom, and I now count him among my favorite authors.

0765350386|4.0|I really enjoyed this book. The main characters were believable, the plot was interesting and the setting was descriptive. However, the reason that I don't give it 5 stars is because I found that the dialog, for me, wasn't deep enough. Also, the book was predominantly a build up for the final 2 or 3 chapters, whereas some revelations and larger events throughout the book would have kept me far more intrigued.     When I read a book I prefer a good philosophical dialog over an action scene any day! I guess I was reading the wrong one for that.    Overall it was an enjoyable read with lots going on. If you like fantasy and action, then this is the book for you.
B002T9H2LA|4.0|Tarrentino brings World War II Paris to life in a new fashion.  A young Jewish girl escapes a search of a farmhouse by Nazis and makes her way to Paris.  Somehow she gets the identity of Emanuelle, an owner of one of the top Paris movie houses.  One day she is changing the titles on the marquee when she is approached by a young German soldier.  He becomes smitten with her but she tries being cold back to him to no avail.  It turns out he is somewhat of a big hero in Germany because he single handedly killed many enemy soldiers while being a sniper in a bell tower over a three day period.  Goebbels has made a propaganda movie starring the soldier as himself.  Later on the soldier comes up with the idea of showing the movie in Emanuelle's theater.    The movie also focuses on a group of Jewish soldiers headed by a Tennessee leader (Brad Pitt) who infiltrate Nazi controlled areas and kill Nazis by either scalping them or leaving them to the Jew Bear with the bat (one of Pitt's men), also referred to as the Golem.  When Pitt's group ambushes Nazis he likes to always leave one man alive to tell the story of what happens.  The one left alive is not so lucky because Pitt will use a huge machete like knife to carve a swastika in the surviving German's forehead, to forever mark him as a Nazi.    Tarrentino uses the \\"chapter\\" method used successfully in his Kill Bill films.  Along with that the ending of the film definately has the feel of a Tarrentino film.  Tarrentino does a remarkable job of shooting each chapter almost as a separate tale but each chapter converges by the end of the film.  Tarrentino does change history quite a bit but the movie is so good that the audience can forgive him and go along with how the movie turns out.    A fresh and fun new telling of WW II.

B00001PE4D|4.0|One of those rare films that never seems to get tiring for me, `Cruel Intentions' may not be perfect, but it surely is entertaining.  Laced with material that is in one instance shocking and controversial and in the next uproarious, this is not a film for everyone but it is a film that has something `for' everyone in it.<br /><br />Couple that with the fact that Ryan and Reese are just SOOO cute together.<br /><br />The film (which is based off of the film `Dangerous Liaisons') centers around step-siblings Sebastian and Kathryn.  The two basically run their upscale school with intensity that is unmatched.  The two toy with fellow students to satisfy their own need for attention (although this film is far from focused on the emotional turmoil causing these sadistic games) and so when the young and proud virgin Annette moves in they instantly gravitate towards `toying' with her life.  Kathryn, who has denied Sebastian access to her loins, makes him a deal.  If he can compromise Annette's moral standing then Kathryn will grant him said access, but if he fails in his mission then Kathryn gets Sebastian's prized car.<br /><br />Simple enough, until Sebastian falls in love.<br /><br />Complaints have been made with the altered ending (which shifts the comical and devilish tone of the film almost drastically, and suddenly) but I personally adored that aspect of the film.  I loved the playfulness of the first two thirds, but I also found it rather reminiscent of almost every other teen-comedy that was being released at the time (the late 90's was a goldmine, or landfill, for teen-comedies).  The sincerity (and yes, it was sincere) of the final third was a nice surprise, even if it seems a tad uneven.  The chemistry between Reese and Ryan was so organic (and that love scene is so amazingly tender and pure) and the genuine crushing waves of the eventuality of it all added a nice and unexpected touch to the film.<br /><br />Yes, it is uneven and it does contrast the original film, but this is NOT `Dangerous Liaisons'.<br /><br />Oh yeah, and Sarah Michelle Geller is just drool-worthy brilliant here with the right amount of charm, sex-appeal, cattiness and pure watchability.  You cannot take your eyes off of her!'.    Oh yeah, and Sarah Michelle Geller is just drool-worthy brilliant here with the right amount of charm, sex-appeal, cattiness and pure watchability.

B0026P3G12|5.0|As a middle-aged woman, I've seen a few generations of female vocalists come and go. My major complaint is that screaming the notes has become normal for a lot of \\"popular\\" singers. By contrast, Susan Boyle has a wonderful, refreshing, sincere voice. She sings with conviction. She's the real deal. When Susan sings a well-known song, it's seems brand new.
0553381695|5.0|The Seven Kingdoms have been torn apart by war and five kings now battle for supremacy. In King's Landing, Tyrion Lannister now serves as the Hand of the King. Tyrion needs all of his cunning if he is to protect the city from those who seek to capture it and seize the Iron Throne. Meanwhile, in the lands beyond the Wall, the Night's Watch have taken the field against the wildling king, Mance Rayder, and Jon Snow is dispatched on a hazardous scouting mission. In the distant east, Daenerys Targaryen and her small band of followers reach the great city of Qarth hoping to find salvation, but instead find treachery.    A Clash of Kings picks up immediately after the events of A Game of Thrones. Indeed, large chunks of this book were written for Thrones before it became obvious that the first book was too big and had to be split in two (an oddly familiar situation...). However, there are some differences between the two books. Some new POV characters are introduced and the scope of the series expands radically, with the introduction of Stannis Baratheon and his followers and the ironborn entering the story in force. This book also features some fairly intricate military maneuvering as the bulk of the war takes place (some readers may find tracking down some of the more detailed maps online will be more useful than referring to the bare-bones map in the book), which is all pretty well-handled.    There's a lot of great stuff in this second volume. Martin is a fan of drawing parallels between characters (he's suggested comparing and contrasting Daenerys' skills at ruling in the forthcoming Dance with Dragons with Cersei in A Feast for Crows) and in this novel it is impossible not to compare Tyrion's success in the role of the Hand of the King with the mistakes Eddard makes in the first book. Tyrion's cunning and ruthlessness is well-depicted, and his story forms one of the spines of the novel. Another is provided by the story of Theon Greyjoy, who is upgraded to POV statusand shows us the state of affairs in the Iron Islands. Theon is a hard character to like, but his viewpoint remains well-written and fascinating.    A Clash of Kings, despite featuring the biggest battle in the series so far and some of the most important and decisive moments and scenes, feels like something of a transitory book between the opening salvo of the story in A Game of Thrones and the climax of the opening movement in A Storm of Swords, which probably accounts for it not being rated quite as highly as either of those books amongst readers. However, it is just as well-written as either, the story remains gripping and the characters are still compelling.    A Clash of Kings (*****) is a vital continuation of the story begun in the first novel and is highly recommended. The book is available now in the UK and USA.
B0011FTQ4O|5.0|While I was hesitant to purchase it since I only have my US PS3 Slim to play Blu Ray on, I ma really happy that I did. This will work on any American player and the clarity is remarkable. Not to mention, the cast from Phillip Seymour Hoffmann as the music critic Lester Bangs to Kate Hudson in her Oscar nominated role as Penny Lane knock their performances out of the park. I'm extremely happy that I picked this up while I had the chance!
B001P9KR8U|4.0|As a movie critic I might not be your first choice. I venture to the cinema on average about once every two years at this point in my life. And I do not rent a lot of films, maybe a couple a year. I do watch the occasional movie on TV.<br /><br />I just came back from seeing Slumdog Millionaire, and if you are any sort of movie fan I would put this movie in the \\"must see\\" category.  It was rightly nomimated for Best Picture for the 2009 Academy Awards.<br /><br />First, it is an excellent story. It intertwines episodes of the India version of Who wants to be a Millionaire with the story of 3 Mumbai (Bombay was the colonial name of this city) street orphans. Both story lines kept me on the edge of my seat.<br /><br />Secondly, it gives a view of India that perhaps we normally do not get to see. Certainly it is a view that we do not want to see or think about. To see/imagine humans living in those conditions is hard for this mind, encased in a body living in a first world country, to contemplate. There were orphaned kids running loose in the streets, sleeping where they could, picking through dumps for sustenance. There was a general disregard for life and unbelievable hardship depicted.<br /><br />Mumbai, with a population density of almost 30,000 people per square kilometre, is the world's most crowded city.<br /><br />I've put an email into to an Indian friend of mine to see how close this is to reality, and how much was the movie. I'm betting it is pretty close to the reality of India.<br /><br />There is violence in this movie. There were 2 or 3 parts where I just had to close my eyes. I could not watch what was about to transpire on the screen. There was some language. Both the violence and the language were not gratuitous like some films out today. They were an integral part of the story.<br /><br />Ultimately, it is a story of love, hope, self redemption and perseverance against odds. You alternate between being appalled by their living conditions, admiring of their ingenuity, and rooting for a happy ending.<br /><br />Do yourself a huge favor and go see this movie.o yourself a huge favor and go see this movie.
0805091742|5.0|Gawande's book is a gem.  It's an easy read that flows from one interesting data-supported example to another, with a conclusion that is just as applicable in business as it is in medicine.  When I got my pilot's license, my instrutor stressed that while one only needed a 70 to pass the written exam, there were aspects of flying that one needed to get a 100 on every single time to stay alive.  Details matter, and regardless of our intelligence and training, we are not hard-wired to remember every critical step, every single time.  Checklists are simple, and their effectiveness is irrefutable.
B0026P3G12|3.0|So, I would have purchased this CD just because I love the rags to riches story of Susan Boyle.  Is the music the best I've ever heard, no, but at least you know she's singing and not a synthesized, dubbed over pop star without any voice and just looks.  So here is my review...    Wild Horses: Good, but not amazing. I Dreamed A Dream: Signature song - what made her famous and probably the genre that she should stick with... Cry Me A River: again good, but not great. How Great Thou Art: Better than good.  You'll See: hum...we need to just skip this one.  Daydream Believer: Again, we need to skip but better than You'll See.  Up to The Mountain: Again skip.  Amazing Grace:  Good, I think the mellow songs are much better suited for her voice.  Who I Was Born To Be: Ok. Proud: Skip this one too.  The End Of The World: Skip too.  Silent Night: At least the CD ends on a good note!      So would I buy a 2nd CD from her?  Probably, but only as a present for my mom or my boss, because he loves her!
B002KQ6BT6|4.0|This is another Dan Brown book, if you do not like how he writes or how he writes, then do not buy it. Other than that he is great at taking things that do have some facts and make them seem so much more than what they really are. Also This was great reading on the Kindle. I could not put the book down after Robert Langdon made it to the capital building.
0199535523|5.0|\\"Emma Woodhouse, handsome, clever, and rich, with a comfortable home and happy disposition\\" is a suitable heroine for Jane Austen's lightest, frothiest novel. While \\"Emma\\" is not nearly as dramatic as Austen's other works, it is an enchanting little comedy of manners in which a young woman with the best intentions meddles in others' love lives... with only the faintest idea of how people (including herself) actually feel.<br /><br />After matchmaking her governess Miss Taylor, Emma Woodhouse considers herself a natural at bringing people together. She soon becomes best buddies with Harriet, a sweet (if not very bright) young woman who is the \\"natural daughter of somebody.\\" Emma becomes determined to pair Harriet with someone deserving of her (even derailing a gentleman-farmer's proposal), such as the smarmy, charming Mr. Elton. When Emma's latest attempt falls apart, she finds that getting someone OUT of love is a lot harder than getting them INTO it.<br /><br />At around the same time, two people that Emma has heard about her entire life have arrived -- the charming Frank Churchill, and the reserved, remote Miss Jane Fairfax (along with rumors of a married man's interest in her). Emma begins a flirtatious friendship with Frank, but for some reason is unable to get close to Miss Fairfax. As she navigates the secrets and rumors of other people's romantic lives, she begins to realize who she has been in love with all along.<br /><br />Out of all Jane Austen's books, \\"Emma\\" is the frothiest and lightest -- there aren't any major scandals, lives ruined, reputations destroyed, financial crises or sinister schemes. There's just a little intertwined circle of people living in a country village, and how one young woman tries to rearrange them in the manner that she genuinely thinks is best. Of course, in true comedy style everything goes completely wrong.<br /><br />And despite the formal stuffiness of the time, Austen wrote the book in a languidly sunny style, threading it with a complex web of cleverly orchestrated rumors and romantic tangles. There's some moments of seriousness (such as Emma's rudeness to kind, silly Miss Bates), but it's also laced with some entertaining dialogue (\\"Silly things do cease to be silly if they are done by sensible people in an impudent way\\") and barbed humor (the ridiculous and obnoxious Mrs. Elton).<br /><br />Modern readers tend to be unfairly squicked by the idea of Emma falling for a guy who's known her literally all her life, but Austen makes the subtle relationship between Knightley and Emma one of affectionate bickering and beautiful romantic moments (\\"If I loved you less, I might be able to talk about it more. But you know what I am. You hear nothing but truth from me\\").<br /><br />Emma is a character who is likable despite her flaws -- she's young, bright, well-meaning and assured of her own knowledge of the human heart, but also naive and sometimes snobbish. She flits around like a clumsy butterfly, but is endearing even when she screws up. Mr. Knightley is her ideal counterpoint, being enjoyably blunt and sharp-witted at all times. And there's a fairly colorful supporting cast -- Emma's neurotic but sweet dad, her kindly ex-governess, the charming Frank, the fluttery Miss Bates, and even the smarmy Mr. Elton and his bulldozing wife.<br /><br />\\"Emma\\" is the most lightweight and openly comedic of all Jane Austen's novels, with a likable (if clueless) heroine and a multilayered plot full of half-hidden feelings.

The dialogue blows, the author appears to be a wanna be stoner and the plot blows harder than a blow horn.  I can't compare Inherent Vice to anything b/c I have never read anything as bad.    Thomas Pynchon is supposed to be a great author, but he clearly took a snoozer on this one and swung for hollywood vs. writing a good story.
B0006VIE4C|5.0|George Lucas' space adventure that revolutionized science fiction film-making.<br /><br />Truly a film masterpiece.  It takes a standard tale of love and war, patriotism and honor and creates something special.  Truly a sum of its parts!<br /><br />Words scan across the screen at the start, similar to the old Buck Rogers and other serials of the mid-twentieth century.  And like those films, it takes place in a universe of extraordinary technology.  But not of the future!  Of the past!  Sure, why not?  Why would there not be galaxies that are so old as to predate our own civilization, so far, far away?<br /><br />The princess of the piece, at risk of her life, sends a secret message through her droid (little robot guy, used in manufacturing and pilot control) and send them off to a desert planet, orbiting a twin star system.  In many ways, reminded me of Frank Herbert's Dune.  In fact, there is a skeleton of a Sandworm!  Coincidence?<br /><br />I won't go over the whole plot here.  If you have not yet seen Star Wars, please do.  Luke Skywalker, oblivious to his past heritage, is just a farm boy who desires someday to be a soldier, a freedom-fighter.  But alas, he will most likely be like his Uncle Owen, living on a backward planet, doing some hydroponics and maybe even play in the  Mos Isely band.  Did they ever do kareoke?<br /><br />The death of his aunt and uncle at the hands of the Empire, with the blackened corpses of his aunt and uncle (quite horrific for a PG film, actually) fires up Luke.  He desires revenge.<br /><br />So we have the plot thicken:  A force of evil, a backward boy with dreams, galavnized by the death of his only family but no place to put forward his intentions of revenge.  He meets Obi-Wan and thinks the princess is hot.  Ah, if he only knew.<br /><br />And the story goes.  George Lucas, director of such hits up to that time of the powerful THX-1138 and the hilarious American Graffiti, turned out what was in fact the turning point in science fiction cinema, just by taking a fun popcorn plot with a simple yet powerful story and creating a revolution.<br /><br />I have read other stories of corrupt empires both past and present and of the lives of men and women who fought, avenged and struck back in the name of freedom.  The Roman Empire (it's rise and fall) and Isaac Asimov's Harry Seldon in The Foundation Trilogy come to mind, and even to some extent Frank Herbert's Dune series.<br /><br />Highly recommended!lot with a simple yet powerful story and creating a revolution.

B000TERK14|5.0|In the \\"music downloading era\\" it's rare to find an entire \\"album\\" of music.  Most of us are listening to short bites of music by a variety of musicians.  This album bucks that trend. \\"A Beautiful Lie\\" by 30 Seconds to Mars is a complex, powerful, cohesive work of art.  It feels like an up-to-date version of a Rush or Pink Floyd album.  All of the tracks are good, and they are enjoyed most by listening through the entire album together.  Of course, the title track is the strongest, and I think \\"From Yesterday\\" is the most \\"commercial;\\" in other words, the one that would be most likely to be on a Billboard chart.    I have no idea why this band has not garnered more attention.  Maybe the fact that  actor Jared Leto is the lead singer has caused people them to write him off as just another movie star that wants to be a rocker.    If you like meaningful rock with carefully written lyrics, tracks put together as a unified work of art, you'll love \\"A Beautiful Lie.\\"
B002N8A14M|5.0|As most of the reviewers of this item, I must give it 5 stars.      I read quite a few reviews of this and other similar items before deciding to go with this iPod Nano armband.  The key features that swayed me in the direction of this item were the easily accessible clear protective shell (with a clip!!) and a non-bulky armband.  Let's just say that this armband isn't for you if you'd like to sport the Terminator look.  The armband was designed with simplicity and function in mind.  It doesn't slip off or feel like an inflated BP cuff (but then again, I am a female with a pretty small arm.  What biceps? :p)  However, if you are a weight-lifting machine, then you might want to go for something with a bit longer band (and at this point you probably look like Terminator anyway, so this slim armband won't do your guns of steel justice.  No, I said \\"guns\\"; I don't know where you are planning on wearing your iPod...).  Bad humor aside, the actual length of the band in its relaxed state is about 10.5\\"-- that's not including the extra couple of inches for velcroing (is that even a word?) it together and not including the front \\"buckle\\" part where the iPod is actually clipped on.  Looks like plenty of room for a decent-sized arm.  And don't forget that the band is stretchy.         Bottom line: It looks, works and feels great.      One more thing-- I've read reviews in which avid athletes were concerned with perspiration soaking through the fabric and causing issues with the iPod... (let me just say that such complaints put my workout to shame..).  I don't foresee that happening, seeing as how the clip creates a barrier between the iPod and your arm.  Unless you can sweat through padded fabric and a plastic clip, your unit should be ok.  Speaking of the clip: you can throw the armband away if you don't like it and simply use the clip.  Surely, that would be a ridiculous waste of money, but whatever works...     May this armband get you through many rigorous (or downright lazy) workouts! ;)
B001GWK2MC|3.0|This thing is huge.  Purchased for a 3 1/2 year old who's about 36 pounds, this Castle Jump-o-lene easily fits him and one of his friends, and he, and every child he's shared it with so far, has loved it.  The bottom, or \\"floor\\" part stays inflated very well, and the kids are able to expend some great energy on it.  However, after only a couple of days, the border section of the castle (which encompasses the outer square of the castle and the castle's columns) has required re-pumping on a daily basis.  I haven't been able to determine the source of the leak thus far, but I would have expected all of the castle's sections to stay inflated for more than a few days.  At least the other five sections (the inner floor and the four walls) have stayed firm.  Due to the joy its given my son and his friends, I still would purchase this product again, but needing to inflate it on a daily basis (which I do with an Intex 110-120 Volt AC Quick-Fill Electric Pump Model No. 66629E I purchased specifically for filling this castle and which I highly recommend) is a bit of a pain.
B000FBFN0Q|1.0|I can not believe how annoying I found this main character. This is not one of Sophie's best. &#34;Can you keep a secret&#34; was 3 times better than this. With Sophie's other books, I have found myself laughing. That was not the case with this book. I think Sophie's writing style has improved tremendously with each book. I rather doubt that I would continue reading this series.
B000OZ0NAI|5.0|The Kindle Edition does NOT include any figures or diagrams. Quite an unpleasant surprise when reading passages like \\"The easiest way to see the difference is to look at the sequence diagrams for the two approaches (Figures 2.1 and 2.2).\\", clicking on those links and only finding a bare caption with no figure whatsoever. I contacted Amazon's customer service about this, and they replied with a mere \\"Occasionally, conversion to digital requires modification of content, layout, or format, including the omission of some images and tables\\". It would be great if Amazon worked together with the publishers to make it clear when there is missing content somewhere in its product page. Paying almost the price of the hardcover to end up with an incomplete product is unfair to say the least, and overall a bad experience for the reader.<br /><br />UPDATE:<br />As of May 3, 2011, the issue with the missing figures/diagrams seems to be fixed.
B002BWP49W|5.0|Or it should - for Best Foreign Film.  The best way to describe it is to think of Bergman's \\"The Virgin Spring\\" updated to a small German Protestant town immediately before World War I. The film's is shot in austere black and white.  One image might be the raw intense power of two candles burning...this will change...to a mob burning down a barn later in the movie.  It is all very unsettling and that is the raw power of the film.    Ostensibly the film is a story of accidents, deaths, suicides happening without explanation in this insulated religious village. Some can be accounted for by revenge and despair but others appear to have no explanation at all except that a cancer of distrust, hatred, repression, and (even)meanness is descending on the town. As we know (historically) this is the core group of people - who twenty years later - will be turning to National Socialism (Hitler) for answers. Yes, twenty years later the same persons will switch from white ribbons (totalitarian symbols of innocence) to black ribbons (totalitarian symbols of loyalty). Sociology and psychology still disappoint in providing reasons why humans act so cruelly to one another. The director Michael Haneke seizes upon that reality.  He makes the film deliberately ambiguous as we watch a society disintegrate because the bonds of spiritual love and tolerance were never there in the first place.     This is a thinking person's film that seems to be directed more to the subconscious than the conscious. The return to black and white cinematography is integral and \\"very\\" effective. That technique allowed the film to move in waves of moods - in the way that Bergman's \\"The Seventh Seal\\" does.
B00164KYV4|1.0|I was persuaded to watch this movie by someone who claimed it would help me to understand contemporary American culture.  I fervently hope this is not the case.  I couldn't find a single point of interest - the dialog/script is flat, the characters can't even aspire to being two-dimensional, and the intellectual content is preceded by a minus sign. It's just boring, dull, unimportant and a waste of whatever it cost to make and market.  Worth making a detour to avoid.
B00003CXB4|5.0|Probably the greatest animated movie ever made, \\"The Lion King\\" became the highest money maker at the boxoffice in 1994 and went on to win two Academy Awards for its music written by Sir Elton John and Tim Rice. The story focuses on a young lion cub who is recued by his father after nearly being tramled to death by wild animals. The father, a King over his land, dies, and the cub Simba, runs away thinking he is to blame for his dad's death. In actuality it is Simba's evil uncle Scar who is responsible for this untimely death as he himself wants to be the heir over the land. A tearjerker in every sense, \\"The Lion King\\" was the first animated film to ever tackle the issue of death with children, and it is highly regarded for its sensitive approach in dramatizing this rare subject matter, especially to preschoolers. I love \\"The Lion King\\" and it is one of those rare films you can watch in numerous showings. The actors doing the voices of the characters are a who's who in Hollywood featuring James Earl Jones, Madge Sinclair, Jeremy Irons, Whoppi Goldberg, and Matthew Broderick. The DVD itself is long out-of-print as Disney shoved the film back into its archives several years ago, the same way it did with many of its titles, but there are many here on Amazon to buy from individual sellers. Talk is the Blue-Ray version of \\"The Lion King\\" may have a 2010 release so there is every reason to speculate that another DVD edition is in the works. Since its 1994 release \\"The Lion King\\" has grossed nearly $800,000,000 worldwide.
B001D08SK0|3.0|I could not have been more excited about this package when I heard about it. So much so that I specifically asked someone to buy it for me as a holiday gift. And upon receiving it, I can say, with some amount of certainty, that this is little more than a glorified version of everything else I already have.... and poorly packaged at that.<br /><br />First of all: the other reviewers are right, the packaging ruins the discs inside. I didn't believe it either until I saw it. I pulled the CDs and DVD out and saw some minor scratches, figuring it wouldn't really affect the playback - and it didn't. But so what? I should NEVER receive a brand new product with scratches in it. And even worse, it seems that the vinyl is so poorly pressed that there are what appear to be \\"smudges\\" in the grooves. It's as though someone took a tiny piece of steel wool and made a little gash in one spot on the first track. And it is extremely audible. Moreover, the packaging itself is all banged up, with bent corners on the vinyl, crease marks on the inner sleeve, etc.<br /><br />As far as content goes, the other reviewers are right here as well. There just isn't enough. We could have had a much more substantial set here with all the tape that exists. The book inside is top-notch.... I only wish the musical content matched it.<br /><br />If you've never heard Kind of Blue, do yourself a favor and buy any of the remastered CDs singly. You won't regret it. When it comes time that you want to dig deeper and find the treasure troves of other content out there, you might consider buying this box, but you'd probably be better off finding it somewhere else.<br />--------------<br /><br />UPDATE 01.14.10: After a week of frustration with this product I returned it as defective.  Really bummed about that, but so it goes.

Everyone is always reluctant to read a \\"dog book\\" because they know that the dog will die. Yet I continue to beg people to give THIS BOOK a chance.  It's lovely, uplifting and crushing at different points, but ends in a way which makes everyone who loves their dogs have hope.  I treasure this book.

B002NWRMVS|5.0|I asked for this cd for Christmas but was a little unsure about whether I'd like it after reading some of the reviews here.  A lot  of people seem to miss the \\"old Norah\\", and by that I guess they mean  the young girl with the mellow moody songs on her debut.  I loved that  cd but I'm not interested in hearing her repeat that formula over and  over.  Do we really need \\"Don't Know Why Version 23\\"?  I for one have  a lot of respect for Norah.  Each album she's recorded has followed  a slightly, SLIGHTLY different path than the one before.  This one   knocked me out when I first played it.  Her voice is still gorgeous and expressive, the melodies are stronger than ever, the lyrics are  wry, knowing and occasionally funny and the production and tone of  the album are a perfect fit for her style.  I wonder if a lot of people bought the first cd as mellow background music and now they're  not sure what happened to their girl?  I hate it when musicians do the  same thing over and over, pleasing an ever-dwindling bunch of fans.  I like the sort of alt/indie/whatever-rock style you'd call this.  She  sounds to me like someone who is spreading her wings, and I love it.  Listen with an open mind and see if you don't agree.  Bravo, Norah.
B001C48EF6|4.0|Warning: this review may contain spoilers--Who knew? Dowdy Queen Victoria, the plump Monarch who was a virtual recluse for 40 years after the death of her husband, Prince Albert, actually led a life fraught with drama and intrigue in her younger days. 'The Young Victoria' not only chronicles the young Queen's romance with her husband-to-be but also does a pretty good job of detailing the political machinations surrounding her ascent to the throne.<br /><br />The Act I 'set-up' draws you in right away. Following the death of Victoria's father, the Duke of Kent in 1820, less than a year after Victoria's birth, the Duchess of Kent eventually hooked up with former Army Officer John Conroy, who offered his services as comptroller to the widow and her infant queen-to-be. Conroy insisted that Victoria be raised under the atrocious 'Kensington system', rules designed to prevent the future Queen from having any contact with other children while growing up. What's more, Victoria was forced to sleep in her mother's bedroom everyday until she became Queen.<br /><br />The film explains that in 1830 Parliament passed the Regency Act, which established that Victoria's mother would become regent (and hence Guardian) in the event that Victoria acceded to the throne while still a minor. During this time, the Duchess and Conroy tried to intimidate the hapless princess and insisted that she sign papers making Conroy her private secretary and treasurer. Strong-willed Victoria would have none of it, and refused to go along with Conroy's and her mother's nefarious plans. The Duchess disliked King William as she regarded him as a philanderer who brought disrespect to the Monarchy; the King felt the Duchess disrespected his wife. As a result, the Duchess attempted to limit Victoria's contact with the King. In an over-the-top scene which seemed to actually have occurred in history, the King berated the Duchess at his birthday banquet, stating that it was his goal to survive until Victoria reached her 18th birthday so that her mother would not become regent.<br /><br />King William kept his word and died a short time after Victoria became eligible to accede to the throne. Victoria took revenge on her mother for her support of Conroy, whom she blamed for making her childhood so miserable. They were both banished to a secluded apartment in Buckingham Palace and for a number of years Victoria had little contact with her mother.<br /><br />'The Young Victoria' conveys the excitement and pomp and circumstance surrounding Victoria's coronation as Queen. A good part of the film deals with Victoria's relationship with Lord Melbourne, the Whig Party Prime Minister who unfortunately is depicted in the film as much younger than he actually was. In the beginning Melbourne gains the young Queen's trust and they become good friends. In the early years of her reign, she sees Melbourne as a progressive, but later loses respect for him somewhat as he's revealed to be a typical politician, hiding his contempt for the masses whom he's supposed to be championing. In reality, Melbourne was more a father figure to Victoria, but the film hints at some sexual tension between the Prime Minister and Prince Albert, as though they were romantic rivals.<br /><br />The plot thickens when Melbourne is forced out and the Queen must commission Sir Robert Peel, of the more conservative Tory party, as the new Prime Minister. The film chronicles the events of 'The Bedchamber Crisis' in which Peel resigned after Victoria refused to replace some of her Bedchamber ladies with the wives of Tory politicians. The film leaves out another scandal which involved a Lady Hastings, one of the Duchess's ladies-in-waiting who was accused of having an affair with John Conroy and becoming pregnant by him. Because of her hatred for Conroy, Victoria contributed to the nasty rumors being spread about Hastings' alleged pregnancy. As it turned out, Hastings only appeared pregnant--what she actually had was anabdominal tumor. Victoria's inexperience shows during the Bedchamber Crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the Hastings Affair.<br /><br />The rest of the 'The Young Victoria' deals with  -- of course --  the romance between the Queen and Prince Albert. Victoria kept Albert waiting,  as the film makes clear, since she wanted to acclimate herself to her duties as the new Sovereign. They spent a good deal of time corresponding with one another until Albert returned to England and gave Victoria support during the trying times of the Bedchamber Crisis.<br /><br />I find a good number of parallels between Prince Albert and Prince Philip, the current Queen's husband. While Philip is mainly Danish, he went to school in Germany and had in-laws who were of German background. Both Albert and Philip made it their business to reform etiquette in the Court (there's a great scene where Albert discovers that the servants are still setting a table for King George III even though he had been dead for years!). Albert's struggle was the same for Philip--as husbands of Monarchs, they had to find something to do. Both Albert and Philip became involved in various civic projects and proved that they didn't have to live continually in the shadow of their ever-popular wives.<br /><br />Fortunately there's an excellent scene toward the end of the film where Albert infuriates Victoria with what she perceives as his 'interference' in her affairs. Albert doesn't want a second 'Bedchamber Crisis' so he goes over his wife's head and arranges a compromise involving Victoria's bedchamber ladies. Victoria is barely talking to Albert when an assassin's bullets almost cuts them both down (in the film Albert is shot in the arm but this never happened!).<br /><br />The performances in the film are uniformly excellent, especially the principals, Emily Blunt and Rupert Friend. The Young Victoria ends rather abruptly and the closing credits lean too much toward hagiography (no mention of Victoria's depression after Albert's death). But 'Victoria' is still an engaging drama and fascinating history lesson.e shows during the Bedchamber Crisis but the film's scenarists ignore some of the more unsavory aspects of her character as evidenced by the Hastings Affair.

0385504225|5.0|Just finished this wonderful book, set in my hometown of Washington DC.  About all I can say is that this is probably the best of Brown's books.   It has more truths in it than the rest, although \\"The DaVinci Code,\\" rocked my world.  Brown takes the reader on a real life fictional story that is based all on facts that he has spent hours researching.  It is amazing.  It is unbelievable and it will give you a sense that we ALL are loved by our creator and while that love is taken, we also need to be aware that our own religious beliefs may not be as we have been told.  Simply put,\\"GOD IS LOVE,\\" and we have been created in 'HIS\\" image, not physically but mentally.  Just a breathe taking journey to places where I have never been, physically and spiritually, but would love to go.  Read it!!!!!!!
B002XUL85G|1.0|This movie was soooooo bad I had to keep FF>> to get to something worth watching.  At the end I was so happy with the outcome because I didn't have to find these people and kill them.  How did this make it to the movie screen???? Just another ???? that will go unanswered.  DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE IF YOU WANT TO SEE IT RENT IT OUT OF RED BOX OR A BLOCKBUSTER BOX DO NOT BUY THIS MOVIE YOU WILL BE SORRY.
031606792X|5.0|Few minor things I was slightly unhappy with, but not enough to lower my rating of it! (SPOILERS!!!!!)<br /><br />Breaking Dawn is full of tension and danger to keep you anxiously reading. As Bella only wants to be a permanent part of Edward's life as soon as possible but doesn't see marriage as necessary, she at first has reservations about marrying young. With Renae for a mother, and a shy personality, who wouldn't be afraid of what people would say? The wedding ceremony and love of her family, old and new,  immediately changes her outlook and she and Edward head off to what can only be a magical experience of a honeymoon.<br /><br />The honeymoon is cut short though, because it turns out it is possible for a male vampire to impregnate a human female! Still not quite believing that vampires possess souls, Edward of course is horrified by the effect the rapidly-growing half-vampire creature has on Bella's health. She, however, has nothing but good feelings about the baby.<br /><br />With a baby girl (Renesmee) and new vampire (Bella) there is plenty of excitement at the Cullen mansion. How long can it last though, when the Volturi are mistakenly informed that the Cullens have created an immortal child (when a child is turned into a vampire) giving them the perfect excuse to exterminate what they see as a growing threat, while taking hostage the persons whose powers they value the most? When the Volturi are involved are your enemy who can hope to survive?<br /><br />~I very much enjoyed this last book of the Twilight saga. I thought that while there were a few flaws, overall it was excellent. I couldn't stop reading and when I finished I felt sad and almost lost without any more Twilight to read. I would suggest to Ms. Meyer that she should have found a way to fit in a little more action without changing the actual plot and outcome of the story. I also would have enjoyed a brief epilogue taking place when Renesmee had grown some more, just because I am dying to find out more about her.r.
B0026P3G12|5.0|Since first hearing her sing on \\"Britain's Got Talent,   I've been a fan of Susan Boyle.  Following that performance, I heard her sing as a guest on other TV shows.   Mellifluous is the word that comes to mind when you hear her sing.   For her first CD she's done a magnificent job.   It's hard to say which song is my favorite .....they are all so good.   I am happy for Susan that she was able to ignore those who didn't think she could make it as a professional singer, and she overcame the initial setback following the frenzy that took place following her appearance on BGT.  I look forward to hearing more music from this genuine lady with the beautiful voice.
006441034X|5.0|Sophie Hatter, being the youngest of three sisters, has resigned to her fate of a boring life- because as fairytale rules normally go, eldest siblings rarely ever do anything worth writing about(especially when they aren't even the daughters of poor woodcutters, which might have given some chance of success). Then one night, she unknowingly crosses paths with the fearsome Witch of the Waste, who places a terrible curse on Sophie.....she makes Sophie old.  Emboldened by her new outlook on life (because old people be can quite mean and get away with it), Sophie decides at last to set out and seek her fortune....and that's only the beginning of this wonderful book.    I had never heard of this book until a long time after the movie had come out. Being a fan of Miyazaki (like everyone else familiar with his name), I had been in a constant state of excitement to see his new movie- which had such an interesting title. There was only one problem: after seeing the movie, I found I didn't like it much at all. Then, months or even a year after seeing the movie, I found the book.   It's lovely.   It has the kind of humor that you can't help but laugh audibly at. Just thinking about it brings a smile to my lips.  Even with my habit to re-read my most beloved books, there is no other book that I've read more times than this.  There are a couple of chapters that drag a little in the late middle, but not unnecessarily.   It's a book for everyone, full of humor, and fun, and good characters. Even my boyfriend loved it-though I don't think he'd want me telling everyone ;-)

0375424474|4.0|Shubin's Your Inner Fish covers a lot of ground. As the title suggests, a good part of the book discusses the similarities between living creatures: in some ways, Shubin explains, we are very like fish. Of course, we are separated by fish by some hundreds of millions of years, which leaves a lot to discuss. The final chapter includes a brief but interesting discussion of how understanding our own evolutionary history can help us understand how and why we get sick. Those few pages left me wanting more. In addition to hard science, Shubin also includes some personal history, including the hunt for the fossil known as Tiktaalik, one of the first fish to make the transition to land.<br /><br />This book reminds me, in some respects, of Richard Dawkins' excellent book, The Ancestor's Tale (but perhaps only because I have not read that much paleontology). Both books explain the evolution of the fascinating ancient creatures that are our great, great . . . great grandparents.
B0015DROBO|3.0|This is a very captivating story. Once you start it is a real page turner and is hard to put down.<br /><br />However, there is foul language and adult content that is graphic enough that it will put off some readers. I wish I had known this before I bought it.
B000A0GYD2|5.0|This miniseries is one of the most intriguing absorbing and rousing entertainment I have seen in recent years.  Even though we all know the ending, the drama is suspenseful and leads to a triumphant ending.<br /><br />The producers of the miniseries took great efforts to stay close to the facts and events as they happened.  Each episode is not only part of the big story, but also a standalone which shows us a perspective from an angle we weren't expecting or didn't know.<br /><br />The success, in my opinion, of this show is to pass on the magnitude of the achievement to future generations who see the phrase \\"we landed on the moon\\" as a mundane fact of life which only the elders seem to get nostalgic about.  When my kids grow up, I'd like to watch this miniseries with them and see their reaction to a tremendous historical event which changed the world.<br />I believe this miniseries captured that spirit.<br /><br />I've seem some people complain about the packaging, and even though I hate \\"signature editions\\" with a passion (just because they're stupid) I have no real complaints about the packaging.<br />Even though durability or invulnerability are important to any product, what's more important to me is size.  The packaging is the size of one or two paperbacks - and that's, my friends, is important!<br /><br />There is much more I could say about the quality of this project, everything is top notch, from the visuals (even though the special effects might have not stood the test of time, they are still inspiring), to the casting, acting and music.<br />Not that you notice the finer points since everything works flawlessly together.
B002QW7ALM|5.0|This has to be one of the best Sci-Fi Horror movies in a very long time, maybe since [[ASIN:6305222916 Event Horizon]] was released back in 1997.  It takes place in a spaceship, where two astronauts wake up from hyper-sleep and seem to have memory loss and can't remember what thier mission was, from there, tension builds up as we join them in thier journey to find out what is going on, as they explore the creepy spaceship.  A very intriguing plot, a dark atmosphere, and very interesting characters.  both Dennis Quiad and Ben Foster do a great job in this movie, and shine with thier performance.  overall, i was kept attached to the screen while watching this movie, it has this unique creepy atmosphere, like playing one of those space video games.  not to be missed.
B001UV4XUG|3.0|\\"(500) Days of Summer\\" is a story of boy-meets-girl, as the voiceover narration says. But -the narrator's baritone cautions- it's not a love story. It is a movie of twenty-something romantic angst with two appealing lead actors that smothers in its own self-conscious hipness. Tom Hansen (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is a sweet, neurotic greeting card writer whose girlfriend Summer Finn (Zooey Deschanel) decided they should stop seeing one another on the 290th day of their relationship. Tom went home and started breaking plates. As his friends and little sister Rachel (Chloe Moretz) crowd around, he recalls the good and bad of their relationship and vows to get Summer back. Tom thought she was \\"the one\\". Summer thought he was nice and never wanted a \\"boyfriend\\".<br /><br />It's ironic that \\"500 Days of Summer\\" breaks with romantic comedy convention and takes a more philosophical turn, because the rest of the movie is cribbed from the stylistic pantheon of \\"independent\\" filmmaking. From the parentheses in the title to the precocious child spouting dating tips, this movie is like a checklist of how to make a quirky romance: Jump around in time. Have the characters speak to the camera in pseudo-documentary black-and-white film clips. Use corny graphics to indicate mood. Add a superfluous narration. I have seen Tom's two nerdy friends in more movies than I can count. There's nothing exactly wrong with them, except that they are a clich&eacute;, and I'm not sure why he has nerdy friends. He's not a nerd. Summer wears ribbons (!) in her hair.<br /><br />This patchwork of self-conscious quirkiness makes everything seem insincere. This might be overlooked -with some effort- if the characters were fun to watch. But Tom is neurotic, self-defeating, childlike, insecure, and he talks a lot about his feelings. He is playing the traditional (insulting) female role in an onscreen romance, while Summer takes the typical male role. She's always the aggressor and doesn't want to be joined at the hip to anyone. There is even a conversation where the role reversal is made explicit by way of a reference to \\"Sid & Nancy\\" (that would be Vicious & Spungen). I'm afraid I don't think this is terribly clever. It's just another gimmick to hide a lack of creativity and basic appeal. The 3 stars are for Joseph Gordon-Levitt and Zooey Dechanel, who could be quite charming in another film.here is even a conversation where the role reversal is made explicit by way of a reference to \\"Sid & Nancy\\" (that would be Vicious & Spungen).

B00005JLPK|4.0|The story of Frida Kahlo is told with little dialog and mostly vivid scenes of events in her life. It is a biography, but creatively uses her work to tell the story of her tragically short life. Of course, as an art film, it has nothing in the way of suspense or action - but I also read the book. Its the kind of movie that you need to watch more than once. For anyone interested in Frida's work, I highly recommend it.

B002BFBAUG|4.0|I found Adventureland to be a great movie with lots of laughs, 80s references, and good old pot smoking conversations. The blu-ray transfer is amazing in both picture and sound. The extras include some deleted scenes, short making-of documentary, and audio commentary.<br /><br />*Note about the AUDIO COMMENTARY: It says that it's commentary with director Greg Mottola and actor Jesse Eisenberg but might as well just be the director. The director CONSTANTLY talks and rarely allows Eisenberg to get a word in which pisses me off because there are a lot of scenes where I wanted the actors perspective or input and the director just keeps talking and talking about mostly nonsense. I know the commentary isn't the most important thing compared to everything else but if I was Jesse Eisenberg, I'd want to talk about my first major motion picture role instead of the director cutting me off and talking about BS half the time. Other than that, the extras are fine.
B001C4CI8A|5.0|\\"Body of Lies\\", adapted from the same titled book by David Ignatius, is a superbly plotted, well acted, well filmed \\"intelligent\\" thriller.  The film presents numerous examples of covert \\"tradecraft\\" and techniques but avoids becoming a Geekfest.    The moral complexities and paradoxes of the \\"War On Terror\\" are fully explored here.  Russell Crowe's cynical CIA bureaucrat \\"remotely controls\\" Leonardo DiCaprio's field agent.  The tension between the clinical Crowe, who pushes buttons, and the in the flesh DeCaprio, who pulls triggers, captures the dichotomy of the foot-soldier in the field and his office bureaucrat commander.    Refreshingly, the \\"natives\\" are depicted sympathetically.  Jordanian Intelligence Chief Hani is a suave, sophisticated operator.  Even some of the terrorist suspects are shown as full human beings rather than Dick Cheney-George W. Bush \\"evildoers\\".      The film offers tremendous plot twists.  Its one weakness is the relationship that develops between DeCaprio's character and a Jordanian medical doctor.  Certainly, inter-religious relationships happen everywhere.  Many U.S. service people in Iraq have married Iraqi women, but DeCaprio's CIA character would be detested by all, even pro-U.S. Jordanians.    Still, this film is the Truth!  Can you handle it?
0143105426|5.0|I admit I'm one of those bibliophiles who collects the different editions of favorite titles, and I could not resist this cover by artist Ruben Toledo. The book itself is a classic, and timeless in its appeal. Jane Austen's \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" is a well-written satire on the hypocrisies of Regency society as exposed through her various well-delineated characters. Mrs. Bennet is eager to marry off her five daughters - the beautiful and quiet Jane, the strong-willed Elizabeth, Mary, Kitty and flighty Lydia. So when a young man of means moves into neighboring Netherfield Park, Mrs. Bennet is determined that one of her daughters should snag the gentleman in question, Mr. Bingley. Mrs. Bennet's character is truly a caricature and an almost scathing portrayal of the society of the time - mothers desperate to see their daughters married off, especially given the Bennets' predicament - with no male heir, the family home and fortune would be entailed away from the Bennets' in the event of Mr. Bennet's death.<br /><br />It is also a harsh criticism of the hypocrisy and pride of the ruling classes as well-embodied in the character of Fitzwilliam Darcy, whose pride makes him look down upon the Bennets and the rest of society not equal to his own station, though of course he doesn't count upon his own traitorous feelings when he falls for Elizabeth Bennet (whose prejudice against Darcy almost blinds her to the flaws in another). The lively and almost fiery exchanges between Elizabeth and Darcy are one of the most interesting and captivating aspects of the novel. There are a host of other characters that make this novel an engrossing read - the haughty Lady Catherine de Bourgh who is hell-bent on marrying off her sickly daughter to Darcy, the comical and 'greasy' Mr. Collins who reveals his own mercenary tendencies despite being a man of the cloth, the morally bankrupt Mr. Wickham, and many others. It is a delightful tale of the battle between the social classes, and a wonderful character study. Though the language takes some getting used to (it can appear quite stilted to those unused to reading this style of writing - the flowery, stuffy sort), the story itself is compelling enough to make it a worthwhile read. In fact, having fallen in love with the novel about two decades ago, I've since re-read it countless times!<br /><br />As for this particular cover by Ruben Toledo, I have to say it makes for a fun interpretation of the dynamics between Elizabeth and Darcy, the novel's two main characters. Illustrated in black and white with the characters presented in silhoutte, this is a fun and inspired take on the classic which will extend this novel's appeal to a younger generation of readers.

B002VPE1AM|3.0|AVATAR is a visual feast. And at an estimated $280 million to make, it had better be. James Cameron, best known for spending as much money as he can on a project (see [[ASIN:B00000JLWW Titanic]] and his other flicks that have given him the nickname \\"The $200 million dollar man\\"), leads the way again as writer/director. And with him comes Aussie actor Sam Worthington who also starred in Cameron's [[ASIN:B001FB55I0 Terminator Salvation]] film.<br /><br />As stated at the beginning, this is a highly stylized, visual film that has 3-D effects galore. You feel like you're riding on the back of some faraway creature as it dives through clouds, brushes the forest tops, and skims floating cliff faces. It is THIS that gives most, if not all, of the film's entertainment punch. If you didn't see it in 3-D, then you're missing out on the best part of the movie.<br /><br />But where the film falls down is its story. This film is basically a rip-off of two ideas: [[ASIN:B00008PBZZ Dances with Wolves]] and Frank Herbert's lesser known Pandora series of books ([[ASIN:0425018644 Destination: Void]], [[ASIN:B000RK9FRW The Jesus Incident]], [[ASIN:0441475213 Lazarus Effect]], and [[ASIN:0517031892 Ascension Factor]]). In fact, Wes Studi, who starred in Dances With Wolves as a tough Pawnee Indian, holds a similar role here in Avatar as the roughshod Eytukan. Granted, this is a space epic, but the transfer of ideas from Dances With Wolves still holds very true: A white man comes into native country, battles with them, learns to respect them, switches allegiances, helps save the natives from complete annihilation. This is pure Dances With Wolves.<br /><br />As far as Frank Herbert's Pandora series goes, there's quite a few similarities. The first big one is the planet. In both Frank's and Cameron's universes, the planet is called Pandora. Nothing to get in a fuss about since the mythology of Pandora is well known since the time of the early Greeks. But where the similarities merge is with the planet itself. In both universes, the planet is alive. Literally. And this living force has a name. On Frank Herbert's Pandora, it is a life force known as Avata (hmmm, that sounds familiar too). On Cameron's Pandora, it is known as Eywa. Both planets are hostile to humans but are valuable in their own way (for Frank Herbert is was the expansion of humanity, and for James Cameron a rich mineral source).<br /><br />So for those out there that are touting how \\"original\\" this is, I think you just haven't remembered (or weren't around) when actor/director Kevin Costner filmed his western epic and/or haven't read Frank Herbert's Pandora series (starting with Destination: Void and going through The Ascension Factor).<br /><br />All this being said, Avatar is entertaining. It has that big-screen appeal and escapism that so many movie-goers pine for. And it has some of the best visual effects you'll ever see.

B0025KVLU6|4.0|SPOILERS FOLLOW<br /><br />This double CD kicks off with \\"Back in the USSR,\\" a song which has been covered by the likes of Elton John and Billy Joel.  Though I love each of these performers individually, the vitality of \\"Back in the USSR\\" was never more potent than here under the guiding hands of the Beatles.<br /><br />Across the two discs, hits are generously doled out.  The format of the slow folk song here befits \\"Revolution: 1\\" much moreso than the harder rock version that later emerged.  \\"While My Guitar Gently Weeps\\" is a soulful meditation on wrong choices and lost opportunities that deftly mixes philosophy with entertainment.  The Beatles made their contributions to the 1960's and '70's era of story songs and this CD features one of their finest in \\"Rocky Raccoon.\\"<br /><br />\\"Don't Pass Me By\\" and \\"Martha, My Dear\\" are two other songs that add to the durability of this album.  The ironically named \\"Martha, My Dear\\" tells of embittered feelings in a failing, one-sided romance, but in true Beatles fashion, the listener manages to feel just fine after sitting through it.  \\"Don't Pass Me By\\" is a bluesy piece that instrumentally feels like one of the band's largest songs.<br /><br />My quibbles with the CD are that some rare songs seem too sloppily constructed, such as \\"Long, Long, Long\\" and \\"Savoy Truffle.\\"  Additionally, I think the much-lauded \\"Revolution: 9\\" is a hot mess that should have stayed in its experimental phase and not made the album cut.<br /><br />Overall, this CD earns its stature as a top rock album, and is well worth the purchase.

I love anything that Joshua Jackson's in and anything that has to do with the paranormal or supernatural. I can't wait for the 2nd season to come out. I highly recommend this series to anyone that likes suspence and paranormal activities.

0393075966|5.0|Stiglitz believes that markets lie at the heart of every successful economy, but do not work well without government regulation. In \\"Freefall\\" he explains how flawed perspectives and incentives lead to the 'Great Recession' of 2008, and brought mistakes that will prolong the downturn.<br /><br />Between 1996-2006, Americans used over $2 trillion in home equity (HELOC) to pay for home improvements, cars, medical bills, etc., largely because real income had been stagnant since the early 1990s. Economic recovery requires that we repay the remainder of these amounts, overcome stock market losses (10% between 2000-2009), the loss of some 10 million jobs, and reductions in credit card balances, and find an equivalent amount to the former home-equity sourced financing ($975 billion in 2006 alone - about 7% of GDP) to finance another consumer-driven GDP upturn - without the prior boom in housing and commercial building. Stiglitz also points out that the Great Depression coincided with the decline of U.S. agriculture (crop prices were falling before the 1929 crash), and economic growth resumed only after the New Deal and WWII. Similarly, today's recovery from the Great Recession is also hampered by the concomitant shift from manufacturing to services, continued automation and globalization, taxes that have become less progressive (shifting money from those who would spend to those who haven't), and new accounting regulations that discourage mortgage renegotiation.<br /><br />Stiglitz is particularly critical of the U.S. finance industry - its size (41% of corporate profits in 2007), avarice (maximizing revenues through repeated high fees generated by over-eager and over-sold homeowners needing to refinance adjustable-rate mortgages that repeatedly reset), and 'sophisticated ignorance' (using complex computer models to evaluate risk that failed to account for high correlation within and between housing markets; 'eliminating risk' through buying credit default swaps from AIG - blind to the likelihood AIG could not make good in a housing downturn), and excessive risk (banks leveraged up to 40:1 with increasingly risky mortgage assets - 'liar's loans,' 2nd mortgages, ARMs, no-down-payments; taking advantage of the 'too-big-to-fail' and 'Greenspan/Bernanke put' phenomena). Much of this behavior was driven by lopsided personal financial incentives (bonuses) - if bankers win, they walk off with the proceeds, and if they lose, taxpayers pick up the tab. However, to be fair, any firm that failed to take advantage of every opportunity to boost its earnings and stock price faced the threat of a hostile takeover.<br /><br />The impact of mortgage defaults is greater than one would otherwise expect because financial wizards found that the highest tranches of securitized mortgages would still earn a AAA rating if some income was provided to the lowest tranches in the 'highly unlikely' event of eg. a 50% overall default, thus boosting the ratings and saleability of lower tranches. (Fortunately for the U.S., many of these mortgages ended up overseas, spreading the disaster.) Another problem is that mortgage speculators make more profit from foreclosure than partial settlements. Meanwhile, investors worried that mortgage servicers might be too soft on borrowers required restrictions that make renegotiation more difficult and lead to more foreclosures. Similarly, those with 2nd-mortgages often found that those holding the second were unwilling to accept a principal write-down as their share of assets would be wiped out. Finally, new government regulations aimed at making banks seem healthier than otherwise allowed changing from 'mark-to-market' valuation of mortgages to long-term 'mark-to-hope' valuation - thus, writing down assets in a renegotiation would generate the very mortgage write-downs the new regulations avoided, and thus increased bank reluctance to do so.<br /><br />\\"Freefall\\" also does an excellent job refuting many of the simple explanations, alibis, and remedies for the 2008 Great Recession. For example, Greenspan's 'nothing he could do' alibi is countered by Stiglitz's 'require higher down payments or margin requirements' (or increase interest rates). To those blaming Community Reinvestment Act requirements for increased mortgages to those with low incomes, Stiglitz says the default rates on those loans was less than in other areas; as for Fannie and Freddie being responsible, they came late into the sub-prime game. Responding to claims that increased regulation would stifle innovation and its role in economic growth, Stiglitz asserts that it is impossible to trace any sustained economic growth to those 'innovative' mortgages. (A 'real' contribution could have been made by less profitable innovative mortgages that helped homeowners stay in their homes.) On the other hand, he also admits that just giving more regulatory power to the Federal Reserve is not a solution - the Federal Reserve didn't use what it did have prior to late 2008; similarly, the SEC boosted leverage limits from 12:1 to 30:1 and higher in 2004 - exactly the wrong move. Banks suggest banning short sales in the future as a preventive measure - Stiglitz, however, points out that the incentive provided short-sellers to discover fraud and reckless lending may actually play a more important role in curbing bad bank behavior than government regulators have.<br /><br />Other factors, especially government actions, also receive attention from the author. Overall, global supply exceeds demand - thus, the recovery focus needs to be on boosting demand. Stiglitz points out that growing inequality shifts money from those who would have spent it to those who didn't - weakening overall consumer demand. High oil prices have also impacted most those with low incomes, and probably encouraged Greenspan to hold down interest rates to counteract the negative impact. On a broader level, Stiglitz contends that IMF encouragement of national self-discipline and 'rainy-day' funds also weaken consumer demand. As for recommendations for more tax cuts and rebates, Stiglitz says these won't have much impact on consumers saddled with debt and anxiety, and as long as there's excess capacity, businesses will be reluctant to invest (Laffer's supply-curve tax-curve is an irrelevant theory, at best). Stiglitz even suggests elsewhere that the failure of Bush's 2001 tax cuts to stimulate the economy may have also influenced Greenspan to hold down interest rates for too long.<br /><br />AIG, once bailed out, paid off billions to Goldman Sachs at 100% (Secretary Paulson's former firm), while defunct credit-default-swaps elsewhere were settled at only 13 cents on the dollar, says Stiglitz. Overall, he is very negative on the financial-sector bailout (TARP), believing that the money would much better have been used to capitalize new banks at 12:1 leverage, or not spent at all. The resulting bank subsidies were unfair to taxpayers (Treasury put up most of the money and got short-changed on potential benefits), and implementation was inconsistent - some institutions and stockholders were bailed out, others were not. (The reason lending 'froze up' is that banks didn't know whether they or their peers ere underwater.) The stimulus package, on the other hand, was too small (aimed at 3.6 million jobs, vs. 10 million lost plus 1.5 million new workers/year needing jobs), and was delegated to Congress without clear guidance. The result was a failure to provide mortgage insurance for those losing jobs, while instead creating the 'cash-for-clunkers' (mostly just moved sales from one period to another - [...] estimated only 18% were added sales, costing taxpayers $24,000 apiece; eight of the top ten purchases came from Asian manufacturers), ineffectual tax cuts, putting money into a failing auto industry, and increased road construction (greater global warming) instead of giving even more money to high-speed rail. The stimulus emphasis should have been on fast implementation, high-multiplier impact, and addressing long-term problems (eg. global warming). The employment situation now is worse than just the unemployment rate suggests - there are a record 6 applicants for every opening, the average work week is at 34 hours - the lowest since data was first collected in 1964, many have turned to disability instead of unemployment and are not counted.<br /><br />Overall, Stiglitz believes there is far too much short-term thinking driving decision-makers, that business lobbies are too strong, and that markets are not naturally efficient. (Other inefficient market areas besides finance include health care, energy, manufacturing.) Meanwhile, we have done nothing to correct the underlying problems (big banks are even bigger) and Stiglitz also fears (reported elsewhere) the U.S. economy faces a \\"significant chance\\" of contracting again.<br /><br />Interesting side-notes: 1)Stiglitz suggests that banks 'too-big-to-fail' should pay higher rates of deposit insurance, and incur restraints on executive incentives. In 1995 our five largest banks' market share was 11%, 40% now. Regardless, the world's largest three banks are now Chinese - #5 is American. (Not to worry - scale economics are no longer a factor for any of those banks, says Stiglitz.) 2)President Reagan made a major mistake in removing Paul Volcker as Chairman of the Federal Reserve Board and appointing Alan Greenspan in his place. Volcker had brought down inflation from more than 11 percent to under 4 percent, which should have assured his reappointment. But Volcker believed financial markets need to be regulated, and Reagan wanted someone who did not. Thus, Stiglitz believes regulations must be mandated, and enforced by a neutral, not political, source. 3)Repealing the Glass-Steagall Act in 1999 changed the culture of banking from conservative to high-risk, and also encouraged even larger institutions. 4)It is ironic that the Bush/Greenspan efforts to minimize government involvement in the economy resulted in our becoming de facto owners of the world's largest auto and insurance companies, and some of the largest banks. 5)Stock options are doubly damaging - they undermine stockholder wealth while remaining largely hidden from stockholders, and they encourage maximum short-term accounting manipulation to move stock prices up. 6)The U.S. national debt will reach 70% of GDP by 2019, and when it hits 90%, paying 5% interest on that debt will consume one-fifth of federal taxes.<br /><br />Bottom-Line: Most books on current economic issues written for the public are superficial, or even worse, mere demagoguery. Stiglitz's qualifications - Nobel prize-winner in economics (2001), former Chairman of the President's Council of Economic Advisors (1995-97),  and former World Bank Chief Economist help provide an important, interesting and credible alternative. \\"Freefall\\" was a pleasure to read.ken consumer demand.

0141321008|5.0|\\"Treasure Island\\" is the adventures of a young boy, Jim Hawkins, caught between pirates and treasure hunters.  Long John Silver, the one-legged cook befriends Jim while being in cahoots with the mutinous crew.  Captain Smollett is the honest but strict commander of the ship commissioned by Squire Trelawney to take Jim to the treasure trove on a map given to Jim by a dying seaman.<br /><br />It's been redone many times, but this is the original, and the worthy sire of lesser works (that can still be pretty good, like [[ASIN:B00006472V Muppet Treasure Island]]).  The language is a little old fashioned, but only makes the story stronger.  The values of loyalty, courage, mercy, and audacity figure large in this book, and it has a much more positive tone than is popular in current fiction.<br /><br />A great adventure and first rate reading for kids of almost any size.<br /><br />E.

B000VWE5OY|2.0|There are lots of things wrong with this series, but they mostly don't matter.  Cheesy plots?  Sure.  When did that stop a series from being entertaining? Inconsistent characters?  Check.  Usually there would be no plot if the characters acted predictably and sensibly, after all.  A number of people have commented negatively on the persistent sex (mostly kissing and talking about sex -- very little else happens on camera), which personally I think is one of the best things about the show.  It's pleasantly silly & over the top, especially coming from Captain Jack.  Admittedly if you're offended by characters breathing heavily at each other, this is not a series you will enjoy.  To me the one enormous negative is the character of Gwen Cooper.  She's unbearable.  Gooey brown eyes that round with hurt or surprise at every opportunity.  Empathy that bleeds out of her in ridiculous directions. Snuggle-bunny-ness with boring boyfriend.  Guilt, guilt at not being able to be home for dinner.  I find myself muttering \\"silly cow\\" almost every time she does or says anything.  She can't even turn her phone off when she's hiding from an alien. Silly cow.  The other female character, Tosh, is only mildly pathetic, and all the males are entertaining in different ways.  Two stars -- four stars for the (sadly too rare) scenes that don't involve Gwen.
B002SJIO4A|3.0|So much negative stuff for this movie...so i made sure i knew all of it before<br />watching it.  Bottom line...i found it pretty good. At least you see the creatures<br />and not just glimpses...yes they have hand held cameras at the beginning...but they<br />dont shake as much as previous stupid movies...the shots are from news types feeds.<br />The shakes are acceptable for this movie. I was glad once they dropped most of the<br />news feed and got to the movie....and how about that main character.....hummm that<br />quite some casting they must have done......not.<br />  Once the movie starts moving,,i found it interesting and by the end of the movie,<br />i was hoping they come out with the sequel a.s.a.p. cause there is so much<br />possibilities....earth invasion...partial future invasion...<br />Good for a view.
B001FB4W0W|3.0|I read the first Sookie Stackhouse novel and hated it, but my husband wanted to check out the HBO series, so I obliged. It's entertaining mainly because it's so freakin' awful to watch. The acting is terrible all around. Stephen Moyer's portrayal of Bill the vampire is marked by intense gazes and deep voices. (\\"Sookie!\\") Anna Paquin plays ditzy, good-for-nothing Sookie, a gullible bimbo twit who gets herself into one scrape after another. (Did this actress seriously win an Academy Award?! The one time she attempts to act in Season 1 is when she grabs onto half of a pecan pie and SCREAMS at the top of her lungs: \\"THAT'S GRAN'S PIE!\\" Unbelievable. And also, I know it's mean, but girlfriend's gap-toothed mouth drives me absolutely crazy. Ever heard of Invisalign?!)<br /><br />The other thing that amuses me about \\"True Blood\\" is that a requirement of the show seems to be that someone must be naked in every other scene. I am in no sense a prude, but I have never seen so much gratuitous nudity on television before, even on HBO. There is nothing tasteful or elegant about it, and it does absolutely nothing to further the plot. I think the directors just like to include butt and boob shots whenever possible.<br /><br />I'll admit, there are some decent moments. Most of the characters are incredibly annoying and unlikeable, but Tara and Lafayette are by far my favorites, and I wish they were a more central part of the show instead of Mr. and Mrs. Can't Act Their Way Out of a Paper Bag (I mean Moyer and Paquin). I appreciate the way the show depicts the down and dirty nature of vampires: their pop-up plastic fangs are pretty ridiculous, but when they feed on humans, there's nothing neat and tidy about it. It's the massive bloody mess you'd expect it to be if you were hitting all the major arteries! Also, fans of the book will appreciate that the series sticks pretty close to the plot of the first novel, and the additions to the show are definitely for the better.<br /><br />Overall, \\"True Blood\\" has nothing on the likes of \\"The Sopranos\\" or \\"Six Feet Under\\" in terms of quality. However, if you are even remotely interested in vampires or just like to laugh at bad television, check this out.nothing on the likes of \\"The Sopranos\\" or \\"Six Feet Under\\" in terms of quality.

B002QW7ALM|4.0|There were soo many in space movies made lately, and lots of them are a waste of<br />time...so i was ready to turn this movie off if it was a bad one.  First we have<br />Denis Quaid...a good actor, that kept me glued to the screen and then as the movie<br />progressed it became interesting.  At least there were things happening and not just<br />a bunch a people searching for others as most movies do.<br />So we have a spaceship...the crew dont know whats happening...there is something<br />else living on the ship.  With all that the movie progresses and eventually comes<br />to a ending, that i think was pretty good.<br />  So, if you are in space movies...this one is pretty good.<br />A keepper.
B001IAOEXU|4.0|first off, without making it a ps3 Vs Xbox360 thing. everyone seems to want to turn the ps3 controller into something like an xbox360 controller but its actually a better, safer (ergonomically) controller. i got hooked on burnout paradise back when it was release for xbox360 and developed a kidney bean shaped growth on the trigger finger. without really going into details, it blew hard. ps3 controller is alittle boring but its a tried and true controller, very much a finnished product.  the triggers are a perfect addition i never feel the need to take them off. they provide a cool little curve to rest the trigger finger. but make no mistake, the ps3 controller will never be the xbox 360 controller and it wasnt meant to be. ps3 hardly ever uses r2 or l2 as triggers and very little ps3 releases give you the option to reverse the controller layout to allow r2 or l2 to be triggers.
B002SJIO5E|1.0|This is one of the worst films ever made.  I wouldn't even consider it a B horror flick.  I don't know what the the author is trying to convey other than refugee camps are bad and if we do it to aliens that can eat us, we are really bad.  Another movie denegrating the human race and developed countries as power hungry, war mongering, and arrogant.  If you are an Obama fan, you will love this movie.  It is so bad, that my disk had drop outs and I was going to just throw it out, take the $19 dollar loss, and not waste time going for a replacement.  Eventually, I did pickup a replacement, but I am still wondering why.
B002VECMAY|3.0|This was an average movie at best.  So Clooney finds out that loneliness isn't everything that it's crack up to be.  Big deal.  I paid 10 bucks to find that out.  I could've gotten that message for free from TV.  And as usual, Clooney is playing himself.  The same character that he played in ER, Ocean 11, Michael Clayton, etc.  This movie is nothing to write home about.  It's about as overrated as Juno was.  Not recommended.
B002ZHKZEM|5.0|Normally $40+ for five episodes of any show would be steep, but when you put things into perspective, the price isn't bad.      These are the final five episodes of David Tennant as The Doctor, who many viewers, (especially newer viewers,) consider to be one of the best doctors throughout the show's history and all of them are amazing episodes.    Russel T. Davies, (who wrote all the episodes,) is now stepping down as executive producer of Doctor Who and many people admire him for helping to bring Doctor Who back to life and for his many other works, which are incredible.    All of the extras are completely worth it.  The Doctor Who Confidential and the David Tennant video diaries are not only good for a laugh, but they're very interesting to say the least.    Overall the show is brilliant and with all the bonus material, it's worth the price.  That and the run time must be a typo.  The final two episodes alone are roughly an hour each, and the other three are forty-five minutes.  There's no way the run time could be that short, just to help clarify if anyone was confused.

Watching the live production, I saw Florez get a standing ovation that wouldn't stop until an encore (!) was sung - he's that amazing.  The staging, cast and orchestra are wonderful - I couldn't more highly recommend this version.  On a more mundane note, the recording is crisp and well-produced, allowing the viewer to really experience the great moments up close.

0670021652|4.0|I adore Eat, Pray, Love for a variety of reasons. This book however, is not Eat, Pray, Love. Thankfully, it doesn't pretend to be. My advice: don't read \\"Committed\\" if you are hoping to lose yourself in a compelling story, because you might get bored. Read it if you are interested in learning about marriage - what it is and what it is not, why it sometimes works and why it sometimes doesn't - and are prepared to examine your own assumptions about this beautiful yet fraught concept.     Some readers may not consider this work an adequate sequel to EPL for stylistic reasons - the storyline is simpler, the tone more somber, and the laughs rarer. But I'm not one of them. For me (and I can only speak for myself), EPL was a pleasure to read because it helped me learn more about myself and my relationship to relationships, which is precisely what \\"Committed\\" succeeds at doing. What could be more useful than a book that celebrates not only marriage, but the self inquiry and interpersonal work required to sustain one? For that matter, what could be more romantic?

This dubbed version was shipped to me from China and some of the discs had errors (locking up, skipping ahead, etc). Luckily it is not crucial for the subject matter to have high quality picture and sound...it is The Gilmore Girls, after all, and not a high tech, special effects action movie. My wife was satisfied but not over-joyed.

Passionate and magical.
1597801577|5.0|Excellent novel, best science fiction published in 2009, and I hope it'll win ample genre awards. Brilliant world-buildings, complexity of politics, characterization and arching plot. Succeeds in basically every level. Be warned, it's quite grim, but it says things that need to be said about human psychology, climate change, capitalism and political disputes. That Bacigalupi is able to accomplish this in an engaging and non-preachy manner is the measure of his power as an author.
B0001CNRSE|5.0|A confession: I am a HUGE Jessica Alba fan.  That said, I gave one star to Meet Bill and two stars to Awake.  I wish I could give this movie ten stars. Jessica looks gorgeous in this movie and gets in lots of screen time.     Granted, the plot is a little thin -- one more shoot for your star theme a la Flashdance, except the setting is far less cheesy than Flashdance's silly version of a strip club.     The Special Features on this movie are also excellent and extensive. This is a movie where you can tell EVERYONE on the crew would have really enjoyed making and being a part of.  Go Jessica!!! Very nice work!

B002XMGGK6|3.0|Clyde Shelton (Gerard Butler), a gadget inventor and a self described law abiding citizen, has lived the past decade with the unrelenting memory of the brutal murder and rape of his wife and daughter; a memory made worse by the fact that, while the murderer's accomplice received a death sentence for his crime, the actual killer escaped with but a few years in jail. Shelton is blaming the entire Philadelphia justice department for this unfair deal, particularly though the ambitious assistant DA Nick Rice (Jamie Foxx). Not wanting to risk his 96% conviction rate, Rice made the deal with the killer after a series of investigative blunders threatened to set both criminals free. Starting at the moment of the execution of one of the perpetrators, Shelton unleashes his cold and bloody revenge on both the killers as well as the justice department, hoping his actions will reveal the hypocrisy and bring the entire institution down. Though he quickly and almost cheerfully makes his intentions clear to Rice, not even solitary confinement in a maximum security prison can ease Shelton's grip on his revenge plans, with Rice clearly being one of his intended victims. Is Shelton just a brilliant inventor, or someone far more sinister? Who is providing assistance to him outside the prison? Can they be stopped before crippling the city of Philadelphia with their reign of terror?<br /><br />As one settles to view what is promising to be a gripping tale, disappointment soon replaces glee. The story has a few clever twists and turns, as well as (long) moments of absurd and lunacy. Unfortunately, the balance is tipped toward the latter. Lack of logic frequently peers from behind the weak script, spoiling one's enjoyment of the fast action. The action evolves around the heroes' fight for answers and survival. However, the impact of this race against time is severely undermined by the lack of a protagonist. The viewer doesn't care who lives or dies. Gruesome and unnecessary brutality as well as Butler's inexplicably gratuitous nudity disturb and baffle, respectively. The abruptly sugar sweet ending departs vastly from the general \\"feel\\" of the movie, delivering the final blow to the credibility of the film's plot.<br /><br />I really wanted to like this one. Good thrillers have been far and few this year. I am giving Law Abiding Citizen two and a half stars, as a recognition of its unrealized potential and the few clever twists.

0439023491|3.0|Count me in among those disappointed that Catching Fire featured Hunger Games, part 2. I was hoping Book 2 would give us an in-depth narrative on the history of the 11 other districts, the Capitol and Panem. Backstory, in other words. Though I can imagine that at least some readers would be bored to tears by this. :) I was likewise hoping that Book 2 would dive into all the little insidious ways available to Katniss, Peeta and crew to stoke then ignite the fires of rebellion against the Capitol during their visits to each district while seeming to remain \\"loyal citizens\\".<br /><br />It was not to be.<br /><br />All-in-all though Catching Fire offered a good quick read and tantalizing hints - the survival of District 13 and the existence of a greater, grander conspiracy being chief among them - that augur well for an explosive and exciting Book 3. There just better not be a Hunger Games, part 3....
B00015YVDG|5.0|Tom Mullen is a wealthy corporate executive used to mediating tough business deals, and doing things his own way. Along with his beautiful wife Kate and son Sean, Tom has all the material trappings of success, including a Fifth Avenue penthouse, an enviable position in New York society and high media visibility. But when the thing he cherishes most--his young son--is abducted by desperate criminals and held for ransom, Tom's world of affluence and privilege comes crashing down. And after an FBI rescue operation fails, he engineers a dangerous countermeasure in a last chance effort to bring his boy back to safety. With his son's life hanging precariously in the balance, and his wife terrified by the shocking plan, Tom offers an appalling proposal, the response to which could easily result in the loss of his son forever. If you're looking for intense drama, suspense, and amazing acting, \\"Ransom\\" has it all.
0385504225|1.0|Read all other Dan Brown books, this ranks last.    Last week i saw a copy in the junk bin at the TJ max store, it fit, beacuse thats where it belongs.  Dont get me wrong, it was entertaining, but shallow, and bland.  Seemed hurried.     Better to see National Treasure.      If they make a movie of this boring book, it would'nt suprise me, beacuse   if it doen't make sense, Hollywood will do it.  Deception Point and Digital Fortress would have been Oscar worthy in thier day  if made into a movie. but it's too late for those, the technology is passing them up.
1401323820|5.0|I got this for Christmas and it really was the best gift. I had heard that ABC had put out the book and I was very pleasantly surprised to find out just how good it was. I thought the plot was good and the mystery interesting. What I really liked about it though was the tie in with the tv series. \\"Castle\\" has to be the most  popular unpublicized show on TV. Everyone I know watches and loves it but you never  read anything about it in papers or magazines. Even if you don't watch the show  it is a tightly written easy read book. Fans of the show will get a double dose of fun reading the dedication page, the afterward, the authors blurbs and also the biography, It is like you are part of the TV series yourself! I look forward to  another Rick Castle book!
B003102JDM|3.0|Larry Gopnik is a middle aged man living in the 1967 American Midwest, with a simple, but familiar life routine. His faith, job, and family define his place in the community. It may be not much, but it is all he's got... One day however, he finds this routine deeply interrupted: his wife asks him for a divorce; his job is threatened by poison pen letters; his brilliant, but socially dysfunctional brother moves in with him, unable to hold down a job. And from there, things get worse... Larry subconsciously reaches out to people around him for help (once by having a panic attack in his lawyer's office), only to be referred to a rabbi. And then to another one, and another one...<br /><br />I read somewhere an opinion that A Serious Man was too esoteric to earn a wide audience following. I want to assure you that is NOT a reason NOT to see the film. I think one universal truth about humans is that, regardless of our individual religious affiliations, we all seek deeper meaning to our lives, past paying mortgage and taxes... The various rabbis the hero consults in order to help him make sense of his trials and tribulations may as well be imams or catholic priests. Larry's quest for the meaning to his suffering is akin to what most of us go thru at some point... All of which makes him a sympathetic character. The story, as told by the brothers Coen, is witty and engaging; the lessons are true and wise. Be ready for little action, a few contemplative chuckles, and a lot of food for thought. This is definitely a film best appreciated when one is in a ruminative mood. However, the lessons could as well be told in three sentences or less, rather then an hour and twenty five minutes of film. If you are a linear thinker, you may find the pace of the story frustrating.
B000GSA59M|5.0|I love this little mixer -- and at a great price point too!  The USB interface, though not on board per se, is not the biggest of deals as it works well and is CLEAN as a peripheral!  I plan on using it in the field as well in my own studio.  Thanks Behringer!

In order to help her recuperate, her mother takes her to the ranch of a horse whsiperer, where his mystical powers help heal the horse and girl, while the mother falls for the horse whisperer. Great movie the whole family enjoyed it. Would highly recommend it to anyone who wants a good story about finding your true self.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|The best deal/price and a fantastic movie. Had been waiting for the release since I saw the movie.
B001VLXNLU|5.0|My friends have been nagging me to read this book. At first when I picked it up I wasn't sure I would like it but I gotta say, I was hooked from the first chapter which is amazing because usually it takes half of a book to even get into the story line. But boom! There you are.      You may think just from reading the back of the book that this book is mainly about vampires. Well I have to tell you, it's not. It's about finding yourself and where you fit into a world that seems so different from the one you've been living in. It's also about love, friendship, and loyalty. The things that are most important in life, and the constant battle we fight with evil everyday. I think this is an amazing book. And since I'm a teenager, I can really relate to the series.     These lovable characters will have you laughing, crying, and sitting on the edge of your seat. I hope this helps you in your quest to find the right book. Ever since the harry potter series I've been trying to find the next best thing, and I have found it in this series. Thank you P.C. and Kristen, for being my next J.K. Rowling.
0385504225|5.0|Bible quote \\"the kingdom of God is within you\\" appears in verse 21, not in verse 20 as stated in the book.  Other than that, this is an excellent read.
B002PEP4U0|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book.  Its a quick read, but a truly unforgettable one.  It was  truly inspiring to read the story of a boy who didn't try to find excuses in the situation which he was born into, but rather used it as motivation to do something big.  Great book!
B00005ATQD|5.0|Consumed by betrayal and jealousy, a wealthy Manhattan doctor becomes entangled in a a ritualistic sexual underworld when his wife admits to having lascivious sexual fantasies about another man. 'Eyes Wide Shut' is an intriguing movie. Stanley Kubrick to spend the last two years of his life making the most humane, emotional motion picture of his career.
B000FC0SIM|5.0|This book has been so incredibly helpful to me! Not only do you get a glimpse of Stephen King as a man, a regular person, but he lets you in on some of his writing secrets.    This man is amazing, this book is amazing. I love it.
B00280LYIC|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me a while ago and at the time, I didn't think I would like this book at all. I just wasn't really into the whole greek mythology thing like my friend was. But I'll tell you, I started getting into it at nearly the beginning (which is saying something because most of the time you have to read at least half the book before you get into it). Percy Jackson is a very relatable character who is just trying to come to terms with being a demigod. I think the best part about this book was the way you get to learn about Greek Mythology. Every time he is thrust into a situation with monsters or Gods, it's all explained in a way that makes it easy to understand. Now I am more interested in the stories of Greek Mythology and I want to learn more about it.      This book is full of twists. The whole time, you're trying to figure out who's really pulling the strings and when you figure it out, it just opens up more questions. :) The perfect way to make your plot more fun and exciting.      You know how sometimes when you read a book, the dialogue seems forced? Especially when you're writting in first person kid's pov? Well this dialogue didn't seem forced. Every word flowed smoothly. It seemed like something someone would actually say if they were in that situation and for that I am grateful.      I loved this book just as much as Harry Potter. And that's saying something because i've never been able to find a book that even compares to that series (for me). I was very happy with this book.     I read it over and over again any chance i get.     And it never gets old.
006113127X|3.0|I gave this book three stars, because it's fun and an easy read. I was able to knock it out in two sittings. I see a lot of reviewers commenting highly on Bukowski's prose, saying it's poetic and smooth, elementary is a better description. His prose reminds me of Kerouac and William S. Burroughs.    The novel centers on Hank Chinaski, and his inability or lack of desire to stay employed. He basically is an alcoholic, womanizer who's living paycheck to paycheck. It's a fun read, a beach read, but if your looking for character depth and a plot, you won't find it here.
B00267N3DQ|5.0|Could only find the Blu-ray in the stores, so I went on line and found this one which had both CD DVD and Blu-ray so it can be used for years and years even if videos go to just Blu-ray in the future. It was also cheaper on Amazon then in the stores. I only could find it in Toys R Us as Wal-Mart and Target did not have them when I looked. I bought them for a set of grand-daughters and a set of grandsons. The boys were not too excited until they watched it the first time and then they were sold. Those Dwarfs get them everytime. But it is Disney and who can argue with the Master of all animation? He certainly was well ahead of his time and children everywhere are certainly better for it. The Wonderful World of Disney made me want to go to Disneyland, which I have never been able to do. But with Disney's genius, have visited Epcot and Disney World seven times in my life and plan another trip in a couple of years to take all my five grandchildren so they don't have to wait until they are all grown up to go.
B00023BLXK|5.0|Havana: November, 1958. Eighteen-year-old Katey Miller brings an innate curiosity--and a smattering of Spanish--to her new life in Cuba's lush capital, where her father has taken an executive posting at Chrysler. Schooled by her parents in the art of ballroom dancing, Katey is expected to join the smart set of American teenagers who are the Miller's neighbors at the exclusive Oceana Hotel. This movie is only for those who loved the first, and who love the dancing. The dancing is awesome, way better than any I have ever seen. The chemistry between the two young stars is definetly there. Patrick Swayze was a wonderful suprise.
B000001ESN|5.0|The lead off track of this album by Rush, \\"The Spirit of Radio,\\" was written for and about a Canadian radio station, and it perfectly captures a moment in radio history, between the payola of the 60s and the corporate conglomerates of the 90s. For those of us who grew up listening to radio in that period, the tune is bittersweet, especially the prescient ending wherein Neal Peart rewrites Simon and Garfunkel's lyrics from \\"The Sound of Silence\\" to lambast the emerging profit-only centered radio programming. It's a strong statement and song, and one of Rush's best singles (it may even have been released as a single, which would have been unusual for Rush).<br /><br />Permanent Waves is the first album that adds synthesizers to their three main instruments of guitar, bass and drums. Subsequent albums would increasingly feature the use of synthesizers, but it is here where Lee began to use them for more than atmospheric effect; there's an occasional solo as well as background melody/harmony provided by synth here. There are still remnants of the excesses of previous Rush albums present here, with two songs extending over 7 minutes. All of the songs are self-contained (rather than multi-part suites), however. Peart's lyrics reflect his literary aspirations; some people, like me, find them intelligent; detractors find them pretentious. \\"Freewill\\" puts forward a basic philosophical concept across in 5 minutes (not deciding to choose something is still making a choice), while \\"Natural Science\\" uses biology (tide pools) to illustrate how humans can't see the bigger picture.<br /><br />But this is still Rush, with many time/key changes contained in each song, syncopation plays between bass and drums, and some of the best coordinated playing of the time. There's not a dud song on this album, although the long ones do seem to go on a little more than you expect them to. This would be resolved in their next, and best, album, Moving Pictures.
B002VKE0XA|3.0|Blair Witch fans will enjoy this movie. I am not a BW fan so I did not. It is passable for what it is. It makes you feel as if these events really happened. If these stuff had happened to you or I we would freak out. However, in movie form it is pretty dull. 90% of the time these people are just talking about how scared they are or how to fix the problem. When the action is taking place it is well done. The last 15 minutes ramp up very well and are the best part. The finale of the film is scary. Unfortunately they show it on the commercial so few will be surprised when it happens.
B0017HMF6W|5.0|I bought the Blu-ray version of North by Northwest for my Dad for Christmas. We love the movie in its original form, however we were both completely blown away by the quality! The clarity and colors were amazing. The documentaries that are also included on the disk are also very interesting. Definitely a good buy!
B000LE16VW|5.0|Sam and Molly are a very happy couple and deeply in love. Walking back to their new apartment after a night out at the theatre, they encounter a thief in a dark alley, and Sam is murdered. He finds himself trapped as a ghost and realises that his death was no accident. He must warn Molly about the danger that she is in. But as a ghost he can not be seen or heard by the living, and so he tries to communicate with Molly through Oda Mae Brown, a psychic who didn't even realise that her powers were real. Ghost is one of my favorite movies. It is romantic and touching. Ghost shows the love that transcends even in death. The chemistry between Demi Moore and Patrick Swayze is incredible. A must see movie.
0451205766|5.0|On one level I almost don't want to like this book because it has become a part of and spawned so much in mainstream American pop culture, mainly due to the movie, which was great, and all the mafia story spinoffs/rip offs it inspired in films/television, which were a mixed bag.  In spite of that I have to consider this book a classic. A great story is a great story regardless of who does or doesn't like it. Puzo seems to have done a lot of real world research putting this together from what I understand and really gets in the characters heads and world. Its one of those books that you really get immersed in and  have trouble putting it down.
0545140315|5.0|This book was just . . . wow. It was so much fun to read with all its humor and it just seemed so real! I feel like making a club like that! Penny is fun, funny, sassy, and just . . . such what a girl should be like! I would ABSOLUTELY reccomend this book to anyone who's looking for a good (great) read! I finished this book very quickly, and now . . . I just want more of the Lonely Hearts Club and Penny!
B002VPE1AM|4.0|I thought Avatar was pretty good. I think more people will tend to agree than disagree.  Those of you who were expecting Signourney Weaver to be as she was in Aliens - guess what? She's 24 years older now than she was when Aliens came out in 1986.  She wasn't supposed to be the same character so I would get over that point if I were you!  The movie is supposed to entertain and I feel it did just that.  The special effects were a plus!  Those of you who were disappointed, perhaps you should resort to the Avatar cartoon for children - might be more your speed!
B000E5N684|5.0|When a cop's search for a ruthless killer leads him to wealthy and seductive author, his involvement turns personal, and he must balance their affair with the mounting evidence against her. Sharon Stone looks great in this movie and lives up to being one of the sexest and smartest women in Hollywood, acting opposite of one of the most respected men in Hollywood, Michael Douglas. This movie is one you have to see if you are a movie fan. It is full of twists and turns and an ending you would never have expected.

B001NXBRJG|3.0|I was kind if exited when I bought this but the movie just didn't transition as well as I thought. I'm still glad I have it in my collection, but I was expecting a lot more from this one.
0385340575|5.0|I literally could not put this book down.  I read it in the morning while having breakfast; while having lunch; while cooking dinner.

B000P0J0EW|5.0|Andy Dufresne, a mild mannered New England banker, is convicted of murdering his wife and her lover. Despised at first by the other inmates because of his introverted manner, Andy slowly forges an unlikely friendship with Red, a seasoned lifer and his gang. Soon, Andy also becomes popular with the prison guards, including the vicious Captain Hadley who offers him protection against the jail's rougher convicts in exchange for financial counseling. The prison warden also takes advantage of Andy's banking knowledge by exchanging privileges for creative bookkeeping. The Shawshank Redemption is one of those movies that is a true work of both art and magic.
B001XRLWPQ|5.0|\\"Castle\\" is a fun romp through the murder mystery genre that thoroughly captivates with its plot twists, surprise endings, appealing characters and witty verbal interplay.  It is an intellectual drama (not junk food for your brain) with just the right touch of comedy and quirkiness to entertain and surprise, and  happily does so without the gross-out effects common to most murder mysteries on television today.  Adding to the enjoyment level is the fact that there are no interruptions for those annoying and interminably-long commercial breaks, resulting in sufficient continuity in the plot development to allow the viewer to truly experience the emotional impact intended by the screenwriter(s).  What could be better than watching your favorite t.v. show as if it's a \\"mini-movie\\"?  \\"Castle: The Complete First Season\\" is a great show to begin or add to any television lover's \\"t.v. on video\\" collection so that even when there's nothing on the tube to watch, you will always have something on the tube to watch!
0446567337|4.0|I found the first part of this book very addictive and blew through the first 120 pages in a couple hours. I don't care how old I become; stories of young people falling in love will never get old or depressing to me. I'm convinced women are wired from birth to be enthralled and captivated by the concept of true love and soul mates. With that said, however, I had a little bit of a hard time believing that John would be so tender and patient with the young, innocent Savannah as their courtship progressed. But it was nice to entertain the idea that former \\"bad boys\\" may actually turn out to be gentleman. (There's hope, right?)    So, a little error I'd like to call out. There was a scene at the framed out Habitat for Humanity house where Savannah describes the details of the home layout to John. She specifically describes a fireplace in the home design plans. Being a former Habitat for Humanity volunteer in college (and employee at one point in my life), I doubt the house would have had a fireplace. Sorry, but I've never come across a \\"new construction\\" Habitat project with a fireplace. Why? A fireplace is a luxury that doesn't meld with Habitat's building philosophy of a \\"simple, decent, place to live\\" and we all know they are horrible for a home's energy consumption.    I found the second half of the book slower, but still fulfilling and enjoyable. The relationship between John and Savannah was what kept my attention so I didn't enjoy the time they spent apart from one another during the second half of the book. Sparks' really does make the time John spent in the service seem like an eternity away from Savannah and it actually slowed down the book too much for me.  I did appreciate the ending and was able to reassure friends that \\"no one dies at the end\\"...well, at least not the two main characters. I hear from so many people that they avoid reading Nicholas Sparks' books because one of the main characters always dies and it makes them mad and depressed.    Regardless, I will make a movie date to go see the film as I do believe that there's an important lesson to be found in \\"Dear John.\\" Relationships are hard enough as it is. Relationships are even harder when there are miles of ocean and unknown enemies between those you love and cherish. We need to be lifting not only the safety of our servicemen and women up in prayer, but also protection of their relationships with their spouses, fiancées and loved ones.
B001AVCFK6|5.0|BACKGROUND<br />Although I don't consider myself a \\"trekkie\\" or \\"trekker\\" as they now refer to themselves (Ok, I'm more a Star Wars fan), I enjoyed the movies with the original cast from part II (Wrath of Khan) to part VI, but I found very hard to follow The Next Generation series and Movies. Overall, I'm a fan and collector of Sci-Fi movies.<br /><br />PLOT<br />This is a whole new beginning. Captain Kirk didn't born in Iowa, Spock is in love, Uhura is hot, in other words, anything that most hardcore fans would hate is included, but also, most action/sci-fi fans would enjoy this new perspective. The only thing that I would consider negative, is that the villain is just a renegade mad Romulan miner from the future (although with the capability to destroy planets), who bites the dust at the end. I would expect the heroes to fight a larger enemy, as the Romulan Empire (Romulan-Earth war) for example.<br /><br />CAST<br />Everyone performs well. It's a strong cast. As this is a new concept, don't expect Spock or Kirk (or anyone) to have the same personality than in the original series or movies. You will find that Spock is capable of having feelings towards Uhura!, you wouldn't saw that coming right?!?!<br /><br />MUSIC<br />The weak point of the movie: The score. I'm surprised on how good in general Star Trek scores are (those of the original cast movies are great). Unfortunately this one is not memorable. Only at the end, the music of the Original Series makes an appearance, but it's not enough to save the unspiring score.<br /><br />PERSONAL COMMENT<br />Star Trek is one of these franchises that developed REAL hardcore fans. They will support almost everything you do as long as you keep the original concept unaltered.<br /><br />The problem with Star Trek, especially after The Next Generation is that the segment of hardcore fans was too specific, so the market was always pretty limited. Same as other franchises, Hollywood needed to re-invent the series to appeal to a larger market. This was the base to develop a whole new Star Trek. So surely hardcore fans will hate this movie, but sci-fi/action movie fans will like it.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />I have found people who tell me that they haven't seen this movie because they don't like Star Trek. Believe me, this is a very different experience. This is a very good movie. It's Star Trek for a new generation and for a larger audience. You will enjoy it!Star Trek. So surely hardcore fans will hate this movie, but sci-fi/action movie fans will like it.    CONCLUSION   I have found people who tell me that they haven't seen this movie because they don't like Star Trek. Believe me, this is a very different experience. This is a very good movie. It's Star Trek for a new generation and for a larger audience. You will enjoy it!

0385504225|3.0|Taking certain historical facts to illogical extremes, Dan Brown's newest \\"thriller\\" focuses on the influence of Freemasons in American history. Professor Robert Langdon is summoned by his friend Peter Solomon, the overseer of the Smithsonian,to come to speak in Washington. Solomon, however, is kidnapped setting off a frantic search by Langdon for his friend. Throughout the search, Brown dwells on Masonic history, ritual and mysteries. For some reason Langdon is not the only one searching for Solomon. The kidnapping of the culture vulture has somehow triggered a national security investigation by the CIA led personally by a diminutive senior official.     Other than for a few conspiracy theorists, it may be difficult for most to believe any secrets of the Masons could, if disclosed, threaten the security of America. This does not deter Brown who writes endless, formulaic and  breathless chase scenes,  punctuated by ruminations on theological, scientific (the quasi-science of \\"noetics\\"), and paranormal topics. As for the supposed actual national security issues, if this is what the CIA is protecting, we need a new CIA.    \\"Nuff said.
B002LL13AM|3.0|The playing is really good.  However, you can hear him humming and singing in many of the preludes and fugues.  Just like Glenn Gould he has fallen into this habit of late.  I just want to hear Bach on the piano, no humming or singing.  He has also done this with his more recent Mozart piano concerto performances.  I love his playing,  I have every early chopin, beethoven, schumann and schubert performance by Pollini, but the singing and humming has to go.  I would recommended, hewit, tureck or even ashkenazy for the well tempered clavier, great playing no singing or humming.
B001FB55I0|4.0|BACKGROUND<br />Back in the 80s I wasn't a fan of the first Terminator movie and actually I wasn't fan of Arnold Schwarzenegger movies at all. Years later I gave a chance to T2 and I was blown away. I thought that the movie was awesome and that they rescued the story. But then years later T3 came out and I was very disappointed. Now with Terminator Salvation I have mixed feelings. The movie and plot is essentially good and entertaining, but now I'm convinced that T2 was \\"an anomaly that went strangely great\\".<br /><br />PLOT<br />Ok, this is a summer action packed movie, if you are looking for that, you will get it. Explosions, killer robots, lots of action, etc. As long as I remember T3, this is a very different story. On this movie, the world is at war against the machines (kind of the war described in the Matrix trilogy, so if you ever imagined a prequel to Matrix, this could have been the script).<br /><br />As any other sci-fi movie that needs to show that humans are losing the war, is set in desert locations. This adds certain texture to images and overall aspect of the film. Just to give you an idea of the looks of this movie, the first thing that comes to my mind is Mad Max, the latest is Resident Evil: Extinction (and a lot of other movies in between).<br /><br />PERSONAL COMMENT<br />I have never been a hardcore fan of Terminator series, but I found this movie really entertaining and enjoyable. Hardcore fans will always complain about anything, but if you just want to sit back and relax 2 hours, this is for you.<br /><br />CAST<br />Christian Bale is playing John Connor while Arnold Schwarzenegger makes a cameo appearance. Sam Worthington is introduced as a new character that links humans with machines. I thing that is all you need to know. The performances are solid for a sci-fi action film.<br /><br />MUSIC<br />Again the T2 drums appear. They still sound great. Generally speaking the score is good.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />This is good movie within its genre, intended for action/sci-fi followers.

The Gecko Brothers kidnap the Fullers and high-tail it to freedom with the promise to let the family go once they hook up with their criminal connection in Mexico. From dusk till dawn, is a weird, but unique movie in it's genre. It's entertaining.
0756659841|2.0|It turns out that the phrase 'minifigure sticker' is somewhat ambiguous (and the webpage description only adds to the problem).  It is important to note that this is NOT a book of stickers *for* minifigures.  It is a book of stickers *of* minifigures.  I'm sure there's plenty of children who will like this book.  But if you're hoping for stickers to put on your Lego guys' torsos (or heads) to turn them into policemen, or astronauts, or pirates, or whatever, you will be disappointed, because that's not what this book is about.  (Had I known this, I would not have ordered it, and I am returning mine unused.  Like I said, many children will probably enjoy it, but I would suspect there's many young builders who would rather just have more Legos than a bunch of stickers.)  Also, although there are lot of stickers of full-size Lego guys, the total number of stickers is boosted by the fact that there are rows and rows of teeny-tiny stickers.
B00138GZ5W|5.0|Springsteen was always implanted in my head as a near mock artist when I was young. The 80's and my parents obsession, along with his top hits of the time \\"Born in the USA\\" and \\"Dancing in the Dark\\" were of no interest to me as a teenager.<br /><br />A few years ago, someone handed me Nebraska. I put it in the car for a long road trip, and within 2 months, had scrambled to collect all the Boss I could. The early stuff is amazing. AH. MAZ. ING.<br /><br />Do not leave this masterpiece of American living and tremendous songwriting out of your collection.
B002NXSRX4|5.0|BACKGROUNG<br />I was a fan of G.I.JOE cartoons back in the 80's. I'm 34 years old now. I would say that this movie is only based on the G.I.JOE idea, resulting in a very a different concept. The characters are also different from the original ones. Some more than others. The similar ones (in appearance at least) are Scarlett, Snake Eyes, Storm Shadow, General Hawk and the Baroness. Others are completely different and only the original names remain.<br /><br />PLOT<br />The plot is similar to most of the recent tv/movie remakes, telling about the origins of the characters and re-writing the original story to make it work for the XXI century (Batman Begins, Ironman, Transformers, Spiderman, Star Wars, Star Trek....etc).<br /><br />It's an action packed summer sci-fi style movie. Please don't expect an Oscar winning drama. If you just sit back and relax you will end enjoying this movie. If you are a hardcore fan of the original 80's cartoons/comics and expect an exact replica of the looks, characters, concept and story, you will be disappointed.<br /><br />In this new story the \\"JOES\\" are not \\"Real American Heroes\\" anymore, but an international division of the best soldiers of many nations. If you loved the \\"patriotic\\" American concept of the original show/comics you may not like this new idea. But it's not a bad idea. Remember that current troops in Iraq are not only American; there are also British troops, Spanish and other nationalities.<br /><br />The plot works well. Tells the story of how a powerful unscrupulous multinational company becomes a terrorist organization (as a fan, have you ever wondered how Cobra get's money to finance weapons, planes, armies, etc?... well they first were the largest weapons manufacturer of the world, this makes some sense).<br /><br />PERSONAL COMMENT<br />Many people is complaining about a weak non-realistic plot, but please remember that the original cartoons were filled with a lot of sci-fi and even fantasy situations (monsters, lost reptilian civilizations...etc). This movie rescues the sci-fi part of the cartoons creating futuristic technology applied to weapons, planes, suits...etc. Too much CGI for you?, well remember that the original show is 100% animation, so don't complain!<br /><br />CAST<br />Most of the actors perform very well (again, remember we are talking about a summer action film, don't expect Marlon Brando-Godfather style dialogues or dramatic Schindler's List-style situations). You'll find Christopher Eccleston (as Destro) very interesting, and also Joseph Gordon-Levitt as the future Cobra Commander; Sienna Miller is brilliant as the Baroness, and Byung-hun Lee is a perfect Storm Shadow. Channing Tatum is perhaps the weakest link here as I think he never fully understands his role as Duke. Josh Duhamel, who plays Major Lennox in Transformers could have been a better choice (compare both performances).<br /><br />MUSIC<br />The music of the film really could have been better. It sounds plain and generic. I would love an adaptation of the G.I.Joe (cartoons) song for future films.<br /><br />CONCLUSION<br />If you are looking for a good sci-fi pop corn movie just to spend a good time and have fun, this is the perfect one for you. If you are a \\"purist\\" of the original concept (show/cartoons) you may hate it but you should accept that the original looks were something similar to the Village People, so the change is not that bad dude!<br /><br />I can't wait to see the next one!<br />YO JOE!scues the sci-fi part of the cartoons creating futuristic technology applied to weapons, planes, suits...etc. Too much CGI for you?, well remember that the original show is 100% animation, so don't complain!

B000J103OI|5.0|In the dizzying world of New York fashion, where size zero is the new 2, six is the new 8, and a bad hair day can end a career, Runaway Magazine is the Holy Grail. Overseen with a finely manicured fist by Miranda Priestly--the most powerful woman in fashion--Runway is a fearsome gauntlet for anyone who wants to make it in the industry. To make Runway the fashion bible of New York and therefore the world, Miranda has let nothing stand in her way--including a long line of assistants that didn't make the cut. It's a job no self-respecting person can survive, yet it's an opportunity a million young women in New York would kill for. A devilishly good time and the most scrumptious comedy. Very entertaining. You will love it.
B002VPE1AM|5.0|It's easy to see why this movie has generated success and revenue all out of proportion to other CGI action fantasies.  In addition to its politically hip (if facile) storyline, it has engaging characters in a stunningly realized setting.  CGI filmmaking has not always lived up to its early promises, but this movie, with its mix of live actors and digital artistry, pushes film technology to a new rank.    Put aside the science fiction premise of this movie.  Yes, it has some business about interstellar travel and human colonization on distant worlds.  But at root, this is a fantasy with a Joseph Campbell heroic journey, and the science fiction is a veneer.  Like George Lucas and Frank Herbert before him, James Cameron has found a new well of untapped potential in heroic science fantasy.    But more than that, he tells this story in a setting so carefully realized that it's easy to forget this isn't live action.  I know you've heard that before, and like me, you were unable to wholly accept Jurassic Park, Toy Story, or Shrek.  But the creatures in this movie are so carefully designed that you can see the muscles move under the surface.  Every blink and smile looks like the work of a living creature.    With its pro-environment, anti-military story, backed with occasionally cartoonish bad guys, this film may not be for everyone.  Despite its bright primary colors, this isn't a kiddie cartoon.  And precious little happens in this film that you don't anticipate.  For this movie, being original isn't a priority; walking its characters through their heroic journey is the point.    But if you are willing to accept that, then this movie offers the kind of wide-eyed hope that has been in short supply in recent movies.  It affirms that we humans are capable of overcoming our transgressions, and aiming for something more.  If you want a fantasy that presents us with a life worth living, this runaway success is just what you need.

The movie is about the millions of displaced refugees all over the region, living in poverty and squaller, with no home to return to and no government or people who wants them. Its about the state of affairs in the camps and the abuse of the refugees by their so called benefactors.

6305910359|5.0|Plot Details: This opinion reveals minor details about the movie''s plot.  Searching for Bobby Fischer is a movie based on the true story of Joshua Waitzkin [Max Pomeranc) A Seven year old boy. He uses chess as a way to analyze carefully the moves and motivations of himself and others.     He is put in a position to care about the game and at the same time make sense of his relationship with his over competitive Father(Joe Mantegna) A particularly avid sports writer, A homeless drug dealer, Vinnie (laurence Fishburne) who plays chess in the local park and a World Renown chess instructor named Bruce Pandolfini(Ben Kingsley).   The movie starts out with an introduction about a Grand Master and  U.S. chess champion Bobby Fischer also a former child chess prodigy. He has disappeared and thus the search for him is what drives the motivation of others.Fischer, is the standard by which young Waitzkin is compared and from this reference the rest of the plot unfolds.     The acting is tremendous, every actor is used appropriately and each add to the quality of the story. Particularly Max Pomeranc! Child actors are usually not convincing and I mostly avoid movies that revolve around them.    As a chess player myself I found this movie to be beautifully well written and focuses on the art of the game and uses plenty of popular chess innuendos and complicated algebraic chess notation in honor of those that love the game. It does not insult those who do not understand the intricacies of the game as well.    It accomplishes this by involving you into a story that most of us can identify and relate to. The relationships between a child and adults (who in most cases act more like children than this 7 year old boy.) That premise, is what makes this movie stand on its own two feet with movie audiences and critics alike.   Even to this day, it is a warm heartfelt story that the entire family can enjoy.    I cannot recommend this movie any higher! For those of you who want to walk away feeling uplifted and truly inspired, this movie has passed the tests of time for 17 years. It's hard for me to imagine that it ever will lose in that strategy, because of its universal subject matter.    It will challenge you to put your thoughts and emotions in \\"check\\" and it successfully keeps them there!
B002HWRYJE|5.0|One does reveal their age when they say they watched the original Star Trek when it first aired. I remember being so surprised to learn it only came out a year or two after The Twilight Zone ended its 5-year run. Such a change from a mostly black-and-white series to an all-color one. After growing familiar with the crew members in the series and the following movies Star Trek TMP through Generations, I never wondered where they all came from and how they found each other. As much as I enjoyed those, Star Trek 2009 showed us how it all began. The action was fast-paced and yes, sometimes I got  a bit lost in where we were heading, but watching the relations form between the crewmen made it great fun to watch. When the closing credits began and I heard that familiar, if slightly different, original theme missing from all of the movies I knew I was home again. Of course it was very disturbing to watch Spock's mother Amanda tear away from the rest before they were beamed aboard the Enterprise, and later the death of Vulcan, I remind myself you have to take the good with the bad. Perhaps if sequels to 2009 are made, those tragic events will be made understandable and acceptable to viewers. I rented the movie from Netflix and watched it three times over two days before shipping it back, and will purchase it as soon as I can so I can watch it whenever I feel like doing so. If viewers can understand beforehand the characters won't be quite the same as in the original series, and that special effects are more in keeping with the times, they should be a ble to separate it from the old series, the movies, and the spinoffs, and enjoy it for what it is to me -- a wonderful look at the early beginnings when they were strangers to each other and their posts, and watch the crew start to come together while learning about each other. The ending does remind me, by the way, of the way Star Wars IV: A New Hope ended. All I can say is Long Live Star Trek!!
032147404X|3.0|Yup, I liked this book, it had some great ideas and some small tips that proved very eye-opening. I do, however, feel it should be read with a grain of salt (as should all things, really) because often it reads less like a tutorial and more like an extended shopping list. After learning from so many photographers that \\"It's not about the equipment you have, but more about how you use it,\\" it's surprising to see this experienced photographer pushing equipment much more than important techniques. Sadly the basic techniques that he advises are somewhat... basic. Then some of the other tips (like where to position the camera when taking a full body portrait, a torso shot, or a head shot) really opened my eyes and had me saying \\"Oh! I get it now!\\" If you don't know anything about the rule of thirds or how to use the 'P' setting on your camera then this book is for you, however, don't run out and buy everything he suggests, and definitely read this book ALONGSIDE some more maturely written works like Bryan Peterson's \\"Understanding Exposure;\\" one of Kelby's reccommendations which I thoroughly agree with (I say more maturely written because, sadly Kelby is one of the more annoying authors I've read.) I will continue to read the next two installments in this series, because I feel the next volumes may be more targetted to my level of ability, however I will do so with the same grain of salt, and strive to ignore his AWFUL (I really can't stress that enough) puns.

B000NIVJHM|5.0|Its the summer of 1963 and Baby is stuck at the Catskills with her parents. Attempting to make the best of the situation, Baby attends the organized classes on merengue dancing and wig demonstration. Suddenly, all of that changes when she meets Johnny Castle, the resort's dance instructor. With Johnny, Baby learns the steps to a new dance--a dirty dance--that allows her to discover new strengths and new talents in order to define her place in a rapidly changing world. Under the influence of Rhythm and Blues, Baby can now express herself and her love for Johnny. It's very romantic and heart warming movie. Not only that but it makes you want to get up dance through the most of the movie.
B002T45VX6|3.0|I am a huge fan of Shakira and have enjoyed thoroughly all her prior endeavors. This album certainly took some getting used to and finally, after MANY listens, I have decided to rate it a 3-star album. First listen, I would have given it 1.5 stars. Like many things, repetition sometimes makes the heart grow fonder... So I finally warmed up to She-Wolf/Loba (enjoying Loba slightly more). The album lacks great lyrics and the musical direction is different, to say the least. This album swerves off of Shakira's beaten Latin pop-rock path but for me, this is a disappointment. I give her credit for appealing to a new audience (which means more $$$) and also trying to hold onto her original one (by throwing in a few translated versions). Mon Amour is my favorite track, as it is classic Shakira as a scorned lover rocking out.

This movie is a compelling tale, one that delineates how small mistakes and lapses in judgment can have tragic consequences. An emotionally shattering drama.
B001AQO3WY|5.0|This is the most authentic Marine movie/TV production I've ever seen.  Captain America is a little over the top and unrealistic but the SgtMaj makes up for it.  Filled with lots of one-liners, wise-cracks, day-to-day lingo that takes me back.  May be hard to follow the jargon at times if you're unfamiliar with it.  The interview with the real-life Marines the story was based on is definitely worth watching also.  Five stars!
6305428271|5.0|Former Marine LouAnne Johnson leaves an officer's commission and a nine-year military career to pursue her dream of becoming an English teacher. But while earning her credentials at a Northern California high school, she is assigned to a group of students who change her life forever. And she changes theirs. Although each of her charges exhibits a seemingly inpenetrable facade, these kids are desperate to connect with someone who cares about them. As their new instructor, the feisty Ms. Johnson defies all the rules, creates her own curriculum and instructs this class of tough, inner-city teenagers from college-level texts. This is ultimately a feel good movie with much humanity; one of those movies that you really ought to see.
0312370849|4.0|This was a very disturbing story, but one that should be read. It is very well written and absorbing. The author's method of alternating time periods was welcome.

B000089RW0|5.0|The salvage crew aboard the tugboat Arctic Warrior is the best in the business. Under the leadership of their Captain, Sean Murphy, and with the expertise of salvage team leader Maureen Epps, they can locate any abandoned vessel, patch it up until its seaworthy, and drag it back to shore for a price. Ghost Ship is a great movie, it has a great beginning where the incident takes place at the beginning rather than waits 45 min. The ending was great and I like how she sees the killer walking up the boarding deck with another crew to take out to sea. The music is really good, and so are the creepy sound effects. Its not the kind of horror film that will keep you staying awake for a week, but it will make you think twice about boarding an abandoned ship.
B001HN6EF4|4.0|I hesitated to introduce my children (7 and 5) to this childhood favorite after seeing what they did to ordinary playing cards, but I stumbled across this plastic card version and decided to give it a try.  The results have been spectacular: my children absolutely LOVE the game, playing it obsessively, and have so far failed to damage a card!<br /><br />Defects?  A rather surprising one.  These particular cards are pierced for easy belt carry and come with a plastic clip of truly astonishing uselessness for that purpose.  I cannot believe that the same minds that came up with a plastic Uno deck also came up with this all but useless belt clip.  Its oddball shape makes it almost impossible to hold open and necessitates adding or removing the cards in twos and threes!<br /><br />My advice?  If you plan to use this feature, take the cards down to your local camping supply or hardware store and find something easier to operate that fits the cards (quarter inch thickness or less with an inch and a half of depth ought to do it) and toss the included purple piece of garbage in the trash where it belongs!  I personally use a [[ASIN:B001E8EV3Y Nite Ize SB5-03-01 Size-5 S-Biner, Black]], which does the job quite nicely.<br /><br />Other versions of these plastic cards are available: [[ASIN:B002ZCZYSY UNO H2O To Go Waterproof Card Game w/ Free Cut Cards]], and unpierced ones either with \\"mini eight ball\\" and carrying case [[ASIN:B000EX1AUM UNO H2O Splash Game]] or with carrying case only [[ASIN:B00030EOGI UNO H2O]].

B001KYJA6K|5.0|I don't think I have sufficient words for the amount of praise I want to heap upon this recording. L'Arpeggiata demonstrates exactly how Early Music *should* be approached and performed. The vocalists are all top-notch, particularly the fine French countertenor, Philippe Jaroussky, and the soprano (Nuria Rial). The continuo band represents the apogee of lush, sensuous instrumental textures, with extremely sensitive ensemble playing.    This album presents an embarrassment of riches for the listener: one gem after another, with not a weak offering in the mix. My only wish is that they had presented Hor che'l ciel (Track 11) and Lamento della Ninfa (Track 5) in their larger contexts.     I eagerly look forward to more releases from this stellar young ensemble!
B00005JL78|5.0|In Washington, D.C., in the year 2054, murder has been eliminated. The future is seen and the guilty punished before the crime has ever been committed. From a nexus deep within the Justice Department's elite Pre-Crime unit, all the evidence to convict--from imagery alluding to the time, place and other details--is seen by \\"Pre-Cogs,\\" three psychic beings whose visions of murders have never been wrong. It is the nation's most advanced crime force, a perfect system. And no one works harder for Pre-Crime than its top man, Chief John Anderton. Destroyed by a tragic loss, Anderton has thrown all of his passion into a system that could potentially spare thousands of people from the tragedy he lived through. One of his (Steven Spielberg) most compelling and entertaining movies ever.
B0017KIBAI|4.0|I bought this controller for my Wii to play gamecube games, as well as games like Brawl and Guilty Gear that use the gamecube controller optionally.     It's a good white color, which matches the Wii. It has a very long cord, which I believe is longer than the original gamecube controllers. The construction seems sturdy enough, and none of the buttons are spongy or stiff. Overall, a good controller. You get what you pay for.    It's only 4 stars though, because I received a product from the Japanese Nintendo store. The packaging and instructions are all in Japanese. Not that you need instructions (insert end into Wii, play), but it's nice to have the support numbers, safety information, troubleshooting, etc... in a language I can understand in case anything goes wrong.
B002PMV9FG|5.0|First of all - for those who complain that the filmakers leave their favorite parts from the HP books out of the movies, that's just part of adapting hundreds of pages of text into a workable screenplay and script. The HP movies and books should never be directly compared, nor were they ever intended to be - even Jo Rowling approves of all the plot licenses taken and modifications made for the film adaptations.    That being said, The Half-Blood Prince is the best HP film since the Prizoner of Azkaban. Director David Yates has really got the feel of the HP world nailed down now - he started to get in Order of the Phoenix, but has really got it now. The production and set design is beautiful, and they managed to use the special effects shots to great advantage in the film - as a compliment to the story, not as the star of the show. This is not a special effects movie, it's a great movie with very good special effects (the cave scene is terrifying). To those complaining about the acting - I couldn't disagree more. The kids (Harry, Ron, Hermione) finally got back the great chemistry they had in Prisoner of Azkaban. Dan Radcliff is also finally maturing and showed some real acting chops and great comic timing in the Felix Felicis scenes. Jim Broadbent's performance as Horace Slughorn is the best REAL acting the HP series has seen to date - exceptional work from him.    Although a significant part of the book ending is omitted from the movie it will serve as a wonderful dramatic and emotional opening for the last film. I look forward to the finale.

B000OPPBEQ|4.0|Have to admit, this was one of the first blu-ray discs I've ever purchased.  The movie quality is simply phenomenal and well-worth the price tag.  Unlike other discs I've seen thus far, each movie \\"auto-plays\\" as soon as the disc is loaded (ie. there is no disc menu with the movies, just \\"insert and go\\").<br /><br />The only down sides to this set (why this is four and not five stars):<br /><br /> - The \\"extra\\" content is poorly packaged and in DVD format.  Seemed kind of \\"cheap\\" shortcut in-comparison to the nice \\"feel\\" with the rest of the set.<br /><br /> - All three \\"sides\\" of extra content are packaged in a single one case, with the first disc being double-sided with a hard-to-read label around the spindle.  Strangely enough, the second disc is nicely labeled with artwork and stands out, as it should.<br /><br /> - Searching through the extra content isn't terribly easy, nor is it labeled well in the disc menus themselves.  You're forced to consult the packaging to first figure out the location, then make \\"reasonable\\" guesses as-to finding the content; and, if it's on one of the first two sides, you might inadvertently end up playing the wrong side (due to the poor labeling, above).
0385504225|3.0|First let me say that I listened to the audiobook version so I'm taking that into account when I review this latest chapter in the Robert Langdon series.             Paul Michael, the narrator for the audiobook version has always done a great job in my opinion, however in this book. . I think it was because of Sato having throat cancer and what that did to her voicebox. ..ugh!!  It kept jarring me from the story.       While I am seeing a definite and somewhat predictable formula in Brown's works, this book was disappointing. There seemed to be a lot more narrative exposition in regards to the Free Masons and the symbology behind the pyramid.  For me, it kept detracting me from the story.              Heck, as I'm writing this review, I'm finding myself struggling to remember it.                    The only thing I can say on the positive side, is that there's a nice twist toward the end that I wasn't expecting.  With Da Vinci Code and Angels & Demons, I fell into both stories  but this one left me cold and I couldn't wait for it to end.
B001GCUO4S|2.0|Being a big fan of the franchise I had high expectations for this one, being the director from FD2 (which is the best one in my opinion) is back behind the camera. It had the makings to be a truly awesome and thrilling experience, but it disappoints on almost all levels.<br />Starting off with the accident sequence, I was already bummed they couldn't think of anything different since an accident involving cars was already used. But I thought mabye they could make it as intense and crazy as that accident, wrong!<br />While some of the deaths are interesting, most of the accident is just people running around screaming with obvious CGI around.<br />Then comes the death scenes. They are by far the worst in the series. The only one that was semi jump inducing was the hair salon death. All the other ones were bland and just not interesting.<br />The other thing that really put a damper on this movie was the character development, there wasn't any! The other FDs at least gave you a coherent backstory and some reason to care about what happens to the people. But this one, it doesn't even bother with that.Not to mention the acting is bad and and some points its even laughable. It was way too rushed which is ultimately what ruined the movie. Just because there's gore and death doesn't make it a good horror movie, which is obviously what everybody involved with this movie thought.
0307473708|2.0|Do yourself a favor...skip this. As a massive fan of the show, I wanted to read Darkly Dreaming Dexter for years. Years! Ugh, major disappointment.

B001MW0J2E|2.0|I have to say that whilst I do not feel a connection with their songs. Despite this, I am thoroughly impressed by their production and the sounds they manage to create in order to create their music. Especially in terms of their vocal layering. But yeah I don't feel that any of their songs move in any way. The only song that really connects with me and in fact think it is absolutely brilliant is \\"Daily Routine\\". Really quite an astonishingly beautiful song.  I wish all the songs moved me the same as this tune. So for this song alone I thank them for making music. Hopefully they will make an album I can appreciate down the line because they are obviously talented musicians.

B002L6I9Z4|5.0|I purchased this camera for my 7 year old son.  He is into sports and games, but has taken an affinity to photography as well.  He was thrilled to receive this gift for Christmas and hasn't left it alone since!  He takes the camera everywhere and takes pictures of everything and everyone.  The quality of the pictures is obviously not the best, but adequate and suitable for a child.  The only thing I dislike about this camera is that it does not take batteries, and instead must be charged by USB.  I think rechargeable batteries would have been more desirable.  Children don't really understand the concept of power, so if he leaves the camera on for an hour and comes back to it totally dead he is devastated.  That's when having the option to pop in a spare set of batteries would come in really helpful.  The camera doesn't have a zoom, which some people may cite as a negative, but I actually have come to appreciate that.  I think a zoom option would make the camera more fragile.  Overall, besides the lack of battery options, I LOVE this camera for our 7 year old and would recommend it!
0743454529|5.0|I usually read Stephen King books, but my friend said this was a good book. I gave it a chance and I am so glad I did! I read it in less than 6 hours! (including dinner, bathroom breaks and other chores!) I loved it. Beautifuly written and an amazing story
0446402397|3.0|I picked this novel up excited at the prospect of reading a solid police procedural set in the Stalinist USSR. However, I was almost immediately pulled out of the novel by Smith's horrible stylistic choices. All of the dialogue in the book lacks quotation marks, is offset with a hyphen, and italicized. It's off-putting, to say the least, and you have to work to figure out who's speaking when more than two people are involved in a conversation. You can always figure out who's speaking, but you shouldn't have to work to do it. The dialogue should be formatted to eliminate such work.<br /><br />Other than the formatting issues, the novel is oddly structured. From the blurb on the back of he book, I was made to believe that I'd be reading about the hunt for a serial killer. While the novel ultimately concerns itself with the search for a child killer - around 200 pages in - the novel is predominantly concerned with the horrors of a society where your every action is scrutinized.<br /><br />Smith is at his best when he's building atmosphere. Reading Smith's prose transports you to Stalinist Russia. Where he fails, however, is in the plotting. The killer's motives are mind-bogglingly stupid. It was a massive slap in the face to read over 400 pages to get to a resolution that was downright insulting. Child 44 is anything but ingeniously plotted.<br /><br />Read at your own peril
B000005GWE|5.0|This CD totally sold me on Jazz. Before I only listened to smashing pumpkins, rock/pop/r&b radio and classical music.  Scofield is a funky joker and Metheny is a joyful virtuoso, they listen to each other and work together very well.   The drummer Bill Stewart is one of the most insane ever. He can pull so many colors and poly rhythms out of his kit,   it's insane. Great improvising/solos too. Scofield and Metheny are both great guitar players to hear live too.
1905654294|2.0|I AM A MOM WHO HAS READ AND LOVED THE TWILIGHT SERIES.  MY DAUGHTER HAS READ THEM TOO...HOWEVER...I HAD TO READ PART OF BREAKING DAWN TO HER, AND EXPLAIN WHAT WAS HAPPENING AS IT WENT ALONG.    BREAKING DAWN IS SO DIFFERENT FROM THE FIRST THREE BOOKS.  IT IS VERY FRIGHTENING...CONTEMPLATED ABORTION...BIRTH SCENE...VOMITTING BLOOD THAT WAS DRUNK FROM A CUP WITH A STRAW.  DID SOMEONE TELL SM THAT THE FIRST THREE WEREN'T SCARY ENOUGH?  THEY ARE LIKE THREE ROMANCE NOVELS, AND THE 4TH IS A HORROR NOVEL.  SAD :-(    I'M AFRAID THIS WILL MAKE OUR DAUGHTERS AFRAID OF GIVING BIRTH!
B000XG5J0M|3.0|I love Ken Follett storys, especially Pillars of the Earth, but this story just dragged on forever.  I listened to the book on CD.  I do agree that the reader did a very good job on the voices, but I found my mind wandering at times because there were parts that were just too wordy and did not hold my attention. The only reason I listed to the end is because I wanted to find out about the letter referenced in the beginning.  The story was OK, but could have been told in half the time.
1400086035|5.0|I read this book during my Language arts class, and I felt that there was a twist in the book that gave it a certain.... wonderous quality. The story was so well written and the words flowed so fluently with the story line... I was disapointed that i couldn't read ahead. I would recomend this book to anyone 12 and up that is interested in a book that will make you not want to put it down.
B001KDQ4KQ|2.0|Well....I have read other Jodi Picoult books and absolutely loved them. I really wanted to feel that way about The Pact. I became very involved in the book but felt as if the end fell short. I kept waiting for a great, heart wrenching, climactic ending. Instead it just kind of ended..... When I was finished reading it I felt disappointment that I spent so much time reading the book at all. I would say this is definitely not her best book. I was disappointed.
1400063736|5.0|Five stars, but the Amazon system is not picking up my rating. A brilliant, vivid beginning that earns itself in the stories that follow. Wow, what a hook. I'd read anything McCann writes from here on out.[[ASIN:0812973992 Let the Great World Spin: A Novel]]
B002MJV7JA|5.0|This is a fun family. They have fun together. Kourtney, Kim , and Khloe are three of the funnest women on the show. Although Khloe is my favorite. She is a kick ass kinda girl. She's the only one who has the guts to tell people like it is. In the end, It's purely fun entertainment!
B00005OCMR|5.0|I am in Software business for this movie. Of course, after the college I realized that this is pure fiction, but any way I enjoy a lot every time I watch it. The idea is pretty attractive... some made Second Life, isn't it? And now there is Avatar, how far is the mankind of it?
B002NXSRVG|5.0|This movie is fun for adults but it's not a kids movie, too much killing.  For grownups who have good memories of GI Joe as a kid, it's great fun.  It has no moral messages or deep plots; but not all movies need to.  This is just a fun, sit back and watch the action type of movie.  If you keep that in mind, you'll enjoy it.
1416562591|5.0|I chuckled a lot while reading this book, but I also had to set it down a few times because it was just too awful.    Another thing: As a novel it's very tight and well constructed. Everything fits nicely and it covers a lot of ground in a fairly short book.
0375851569|5.0|Can not go wrong with these books!  The children I gave them to love them and the parents enjoy revisiting their childhood days!  Came very quickly!  Thanks
B002RSDW80|3.0|The latest film directed by Nora Ephron (\\"You've Got Mail\\") is titled \\"Julie & Julia.\\" This is strange. Why not \\"Julia & Julie\\" or simply \\"Julia Child\\"?    The 123-minute film employs a double narrative, following the stories of \\"Julia\\" and \\"Julie\\" one after the other. Julia is Julia Child (played by Meryl Streep), American chef, TV personality and author of \\"Mastering the Art of French Cooking\\" published in 1961; Julie is Julie Powell (played by Amy Adams), New York blogger who in 2002 started writing about her experiences about cooking all the recipes in Julia Child's book. The film is virtually two memoirs in one.     Nora Ephron's comedy drama switches between the two stories, Julia's and Julie's, trying to connect one to the other by highlighting their similarities. Both Julia and Julie have understanding husbands, Paul Child (Stanley Tucci) and Eric Powell (Chris Messina); both experiences ups and downs in their quest, and both have their books published. Nora Ephron's intention is clear, but the more the film compares their lives, the more obvious the film's flaw becomes.    For Julia Child's life story is far more interesting and amazing than the other one. This is not to say the Julie Powell part is uninteresting. It is just that it pales in comparison. Look how Julia Child enters the all-men cooking school in post-war France and practices chopping onions in her Paris apartment. All these things could be hard and tiresome to anyone, but Julia Child does it with such grace and humor.    The most impressive part of \\"Julie & Julia\\" is, not surprisingly, Meryl Streep's delightful and convincing portrayal of the iconic chef. But we should not forget equally wonderful performance from Stanley Tucci as her loving husband. It is regrettable that the charming characters are given only half the narrative of the two hour film.
0061537969|3.0|Don't get me wrong. This was a fine book.  Neat idea having it being told from the dog's perspective.  But the simple writing, long run-on sentences and forced humor made it a little difficult for me to read.  I did finally finish it but if you decided to pass this one up, you're not missing a whole lot.<br /><br />FWIW, I'm not a racing fan... just a dog person.  Another dog person highly recommended the book.
B001KVZ6FW|3.0|\\"Up\\" is the latest work from Pixar, a company which has given us wonderful animated films like \\"Ratatouille\\" and last year's \\"WALL*E.\\" With each work they release, our expectations naturally get higher and higher. Perhaps this is why I was not impressed with Pixar's \\"Up\\" very much. The film flies, but doesn't soar.     The best part of \\"Up\\" is its opening 10 minutes, where a young boy named Carl Fredricksen meets a tomboyish girl Ellie. They marry, and spend the life together (not without sad moments, however), both dreaming of someday travelling to Paradise Falls in South America. This excellent introductory section almost looks like a stand-alone short film with a very emotional conclusion.    The rest of the film is about the 78-year-old Carl and his adventures, accompanied by a very talkative little boy named Russell. Carl sets out for South America in his house floating in the sky using thousands of balloons. Their journey is full of actions, jokes and lessens to be learned - you get chases, visual gags, and even \\"dog fights\\" (literally) - and they are always entertaining, if not as touching as the film's initial part.    With superb visuals, \\"Up\\" remains entertaining throughout, but its story lacks something that draws the viewers into the fantasy world it depicts. This is not to say the film is bad, but with a better storyline and more interesting characters, \\"Up\\" would have been a masterpiece.
