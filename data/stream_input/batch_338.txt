B000066C1N|4.0|To be honest I only ever listen to Bryan Adams' Here I Am and Brothers under The Sun (which wasn't even in the movie) because they contain melodies by Zimmer. I don't like any other the other songs as they are totally rotten. This CD seems to have been marketed at a mass audience as a pop CD and not a soundtrack. Hans Zimmer's score only gets 4 (and a bit) measly tracks. It's a shame as his score for this film is just absolute brilliance.<br />I have the Expanded Score CD, which wisely ditches Bryan Adams' crooning and gives us more Zimmer. The commercial release neglected to include such great musical cues as Swimming, Investigating, Train Escape, Canyon Chase, Iron Horse Camp, Triumph over Colonel and Reunion. They are all on the Expanded Score CD though.<br />You have to get this version instead as this is CLASSIC Zimmer stuff. It's breathtaking and full of a zillion different moods and tones. Who can deny the excitement of Run Free? Or the feeling of The Long Road Back? Or the happiness of Reunion? As I am a completest I have both CDs but the Expanded Score is the way to go if you are a Zimmer fan. Who can deny the man's genius?
B000002P7R|4.0|An earlier reviewer has pointed out that the tracks on this album &quot;crash into each other&quot;.  The track &quot;South Saturn Delta&quot; is a particular problem, because it sounds slow and unengaging in the album's normal track order.  So I tried putting it after various tracks on the album, and found that it transforms into a great piece of music if you put it after &quot;Tax Free&quot;!  Here is my preferred track listing for the whole album (well, the tracks I like): Stars That Play; Tax Free; South Saturn Delta; Look Over Yonder; Here He Comes; Midnight; Message to the Universe; Power of Soul; Midnight Lightning; Bleeding Heart; Drifter's Escape; Pali Gap.  Here's a true sign of quality: this album must be good, because so many reviewers choose different tracks as their favourites!  Don't ask me to choose mine - there are so many tracks that I've cherished (for the past thirty years) that I couldn't possibly choose a favourite!  Jimi Rules Supreme.
B00002ND77|1.0|I think Malcolm X was the strongest and the most beautiful character stepped foot on US soil. So this movie by no means represent him or whatsoever (although it has his name on the Title). I think what makes this movie especially -poor- is the \\"concerns\\" of the director to give a message against Islam... If you are a muslim, and a black... this movie will make your stomach sick.<BR>However the film music is good<BR>I hope one day Black Americans really appreciate this wonderful man. Peace.
B000001GQT|5.0|I definitely don't dislike Von Karajan.<br />It seems to me there are a lot more people who hate him than like him.<br />Why?<br />Because he owned his own jetplane and was a succesvol businessman?<br />I thought Americans weren't that jealous of succes - it's more a feature of the Dutch<br />Now serious.<br /><br />I love Von Karajan's \\"schwung\\" in this pieces of Strauss, the beautiful singing violins fit Strauss very well.<br />And his tempo judgements are great too<br /><br />But there is one major flaw in his recordings and that is the lack of pin sharp articulating<br />Not so much in the strings, but the brass and woodwinds are many times under exposed and like legato obviously too much.<br /> With Zarathustra this is not a big problem, but the other 3 works on this disc lack flexibilty, Szell I like better in Don Juan for instance.<br /><br />But it's not that big of a deal in Strauss' work in my opinion.<br />It's especially the ideal atmoshere of this discs recording which gives me a sense of how Strauss should sound and therefore I reckon this one of the best Strauss discs on the market.<br /><br />Not that the recording is really that good: strings are overexposed with a sharp edge and in Zarathustra there's a cracking noise which reminds you were take no.x is glued behind the former part.<br /><br />Great disc.
B00005JLK1|3.0|I'm one of the biggest chickens out there, and therefore, I don't watch horror movies very often. However, stories about ships intrigues me (the mysterious ocean, perhaps?) so I bought this movie sight unseen.<br />I had such a good time being scared and grossed-out! I really don't understand the reviewers who call this movie &quot;unoriginal.&quot; The gore sequences looked pretty good to me! But then I'm not a real horror movie affecionado, either. <br />I do wonder why none of the previous reviewers have discovered the plot. Most say the movie's pointless and doesn't make sense. Have they never heard of the Ferry Man myth? In this legend, the dead have to pay the ferry man to cross the river Styx (one of the rivers of Hell), but should only pay AFTER the crossing (or he'll swindle you and you'll never get out of Hell). This is the reason why, in old European tradition, coins are laid upon the eyes of the dead.<br />Get it? The guy who finds the ship and tells the salvagers about it is named Ferryman. Seems pretty obvious to me. I thought including that myth added a wonderful twist. There is also a song about the ferry man legend, &quot;Don't pay the ferry man,&quot; by Chris de Burgh.<br />All in all, if you like scary, gory movies and don't care too much about acting but enjoy it when a movie delves into commonly known myths, then this movie is for you!
0064407667|4.0|I know that many people have bad mouthed this book and have spoken some pretty harsh words toward it. I'm not here to prove them wrong or even say that they are wrong because that is just the opinion of one person but I do think that A Series Of Unfortunate Events is a highly entertaining book for young and adult readers alike. <br />The book is about three orphan children whom after the death of their parents move in with a distant relative by the name of Count Olaf. Not only is the Count abusive and cruel, he is also a drunk and a con artist. The children quickly relize what their guardian is and try to get out of their current living situation but can't. The book does explain some adult issues such as child abuse. I see no harm in having youngsters read books with adult subjects because these things do happen in the world, and the sooner we make it known to children the more aware they will be.<br />I think literature is a good way to keep our children informed about what is going on in the world, weather or not it is happening to them so they will know the difference between right and wrong. I found it to be a good book and plan on giving it to my neiece and nephew for Christmas.
B0000A1RJI|4.0|The epic quality and classical nature of this music is worth the purchase price. The soundtrack is as moving as Basil Poledouris' &quot;Conan The Barbarian&quot; soundtrack. The only detractor I have concerns the short length of each of the given tracks. Only four of the tracks break the four-minute mark and the end title &quot;He's A Pirate&quot;, which is the soundtrack's crown jewel is only a minute and a half long. Hopefully, longer cuts will be available later.
B000099T2L|1.0|This album has one power song, the rest are really weak.  Waste of money.
B00005U2LM|3.0|what happened to the wu. this cd is pretty close to wack. by far the weakest wu tang album, although its way better than most records by other rap groups. something about the beats on almost all the song annoy me. i dont know why rza had to mess with his own fool proof production methods. where rza's beats would have been empty he's thrown in horns and lots of soul samples. this might sound like a good thing but really...its not. all the members who actually have verses (very little from u god and masta) are really good. as far as I'm concerned flava flav could have been left off the album. that song and chrome wheels are really the only ones i dont like. but I'm kind of confused...where is the wu tang clan i used to listen to?
0790729369|5.0|I'm not much of a movie person, or a romantic person for that matter, but someone I used to work with(a guy) told me to watch it.  So I did, and I have never  been so touched by a movie.  I was crying and yelling at the tv screen at the end.<br />I found it wonderful that a movie would bring out those emotions in me.  It's a movie that a lot of women can relate to.
B00003CXCK|5.0|The people above have already explained this film vary well so I won't go into it(the film). However it puzzles me why this film is not yet on the DVD format? The film itself is awsome in its grim yet informative material. A must see for every man, woman, and child. It would seem a DVD would be the next logical step for this amazing work of art. As a future multi-million dollar director I know that this film, on DVD format, would be exstremly useful to me and to others hoping to be like me(egotistical, I know, but true).The film is a masterpeice so lets see it SOON!!!
B00006CXXU|5.0|She has style and a beautiful voice.  This album has a backbone.  Not recommended for fans of Brittany as this has too much substance that her fans wouldn't be able to understand.
B000099T2L|4.0|Beyonce FINALLY did what i wanted her to do for a very long time... that is break away from Destiny's Child and prove that she can make it on her own instead of using Kelly and Michelle as crutches. Beyonce put a tight CD out there. You can dance to her music or get your freak on. Either way, Beyonce has shut all the haters down with this one. I was a 100% Beyonce hater, but this CD stopped me. Hip Hop Star is one of the tighest tracks but she's got others. Buy the CD and see what's up.
B00006AUIG|5.0|This is the best psychological thriller I've seen in a long time.  It's absolutely brilliant. Its subtle horror eerily creeps up on you as the film progresses.  The ending is shocking and keeps you momentarily spellbound as you rewind the movie through your mind, in order to try to capture the scenes and signs that led to the disturbing finish.<br />This movie's creepiness stems from the fact that it has a very believable quality to it.  Yes, the asylum is a real place in MA, the characters have a purpose for hanging out at the asylum(cleaning out the asbestos), and the revelations of the characters' lives unfold in a way that's realistic and ties the unexpected ending together.  <br />The film's pace is deliberate, which some people may find too slow and confusing, but the reason behind it is to develop the plot and build the connections.  It all comes together, so be patient!<br />This is not your typical scary movie and that's what makes it so much better.
0783225857|5.0|Somehow I escaped high school without ever having to read this book.  A few years ago, I rented the movie, mainly because of Gregory Peck.  I absolutely was addicted to the movie from the beginning credits.  I now read the book and watch this movie at least once a year.  It is my favorite of all time!  Due to some thematic material, it isn't suitable for children under 12.
B00005JLH3|4.0|I'm on the drumline at my high school, and i thought this movie was awesome. Unfortunately it was not really made for drummers and you can tell that the actors are not really drumming. But still, it was well done and does have some awesome drumming scenes and great ideas for visuals. And cool hats. =)
B00009RGBS|5.0|For me, this movie is an absolute pleasure! I watch it over and over again- I can't get enough of it! Catherine Zeta-Jones is riveting...whenever she's on screen I can't take my eyes off her! Renee Zellweger was perfect as the not-so-dumb blonde and I was suprised at how well she sings and dances. And if you haven't seen &quot;The Jailhouse Tango&quot; song-and-dance number, it's worth buying the DVD for this alone! I'm not suprised that this movie got the Oscar for Best Picture - it deserved it!
0689859368|5.0|I was drawn instandly to the book by the cover illustration. I felt as if it leaped right out at me. I brought it home to read to my chldren, planning on the usually one chapter a night at bedtime but it turned out to be one non-stop read for us. We could not put it down. At the end, the three of us sat there begging for more. Thank goodness it is only book one of five.
B00005JLSE|2.0|Supposedly, the Oscar win for &quot;Chicago&quot; is helping bring back the genre of the musical. If so, I hope that the new musicals will be modled after the classics, and not this one. <br />There are 2 reasons I gave this movie 2 whole stars. One is Queen Latifah (who stars as Matron Mama Morton). The other is John C. Riley (starring as Amos, Roxy's husband). The leads were fine, but the whole movie I wanted to see more of Amos, who was the only sympathetic and also one of the only interesting characters in the movie. John C. Riley is one of the best supporting character actors of our time, and I can't wait until he starts to get larger roles. And I absoloutly loved Queen Latifah, who filled the movie with more sass and spark than Renne Zellweger, Catherine Zeta-Jones and Richard Gere combined.<br />This film was so processed and unfortunatly very BORING, not because it was long or because I dont like musicals, but because it was bland. Behind all the sparkle on Renne's little tap shoes and the false eyelashes one Catherine, what else is there?<br />Oh one good thing about it! I went out and rented &quot;Bringing Down the House&quot; and &quot;The Good Girl&quot; (starring the queen of sass and cool, Queen Latifah and the hugely talented and lovable John C. Riley)
B00005QZ7U|5.0|If you are a Star Wars fan, you know Ewan McGregor as the straight-aced \\"Obey Wan Kanobi,\\" with the beard and the weird robe.<br />THIS IS A WHOLE NEW LOOK!  Man, the guy can sing, like nothing I've ever heard before.  It took my breathe away.  And to top it off you have some great supporting actors and actresses.  In this movie you will see Nicole Kidman belting out some tunes, also.<br />Nicole Kidman is a \\"courtesan\\" aka prostitute in a different time, different era and Ewan is a writer who wants her to star in his play \\"Spectacular-Spectacular.\\"  And the songs they sing are incredible, you here a whole new take on many songs you have heard before, you here \\"Roxanne,\\" you know the song by The Police, but of course, you know what \\"Roxanne\\" is about.  And to top it off, it is wonderfully romantic movie that shows that love shines through at all costs.<br />If you are a romantic like me, and love movies that express themselves, and love music and a little silliness along the way, the movie is not only worth seeing, but worth buying!
0784011176|5.0|warning: watching this movie will put you in a dreamlike and emotionally charged and effected state for hours after you watch it, for me it was days.<BR>I have never seen a movie that has had such a profound effect on the people who view it, myself included. It is not the kind of emotional experiance where you cry throughout the movie. It is the kind that makes you gasp and keeps you motionless. <br />The plot could be seen as a simple love triangle, between the mute woman Ada (Holly Hunter), her husband of an arranged marrage (Sam Neil) and her slightly gruff and seclusive neighbor (Harvey Keitel).<BR>It is much more than that, it is also a story about Ada's love for her Piano. The love for her tool to speak. The way her neighbor George Bains understands this love and her husband does not.<br />The casting for the movie is perfect. Holly Hunter does not speak, nor does she cry and wail when she is angry or sad. She simply FEELS, and we can easily see what she is feeling without her showing us. Her Academy Award was well deserved.<BR>Anna Paquin, who also recieved an Academy Award for her performance as Ada's mischivous but angleic daughter, is brilliant. Sam Neil's charachter is not as developed as some of the others. But the sadness seen in his eyes makes you wonder what bad things have happened to him in tha past, for you can tell by how easily he gets frusterated with Ada that something else has happened.<BR>Harvey Keitel has played a difficult character, because he makes a very crude offer to Ada concerning how she can get her Piano back. Written on a peice of paper, George Bains would seem like a perverted creep...but Keitel plays his character with warmth, and immediatly you know that Bains knows what he is doing, and you trust him.<br />The real supporting cast would also have to be the cinematography and the music. Both contribute an intensity to the film that is priceless.<BR>A Tip: watch this movie at night or when you have a whole day off, it will alteryour mood for the day.
0375713751|4.0|This is a book about a London mother and all the reviewers so far are from the USA and have given their USA perspective.  I found this book very believable.  I am a mother of four with a job in publishing and am familiar with the juggling act between work and children and the with the \\"Muffia\\".  I also found the bits about choosing a school for Emily very realistic.<br />But as a mother who works mainly from home I am in full sympathy with the ending.  If you are a mother your place IS with your children until they are old enough not to need you so much and I am pleased that this book has put this message across.
B00009W0U4|5.0|I agree with the person below who said they weren't disturbed or horrified by anything in the film. I never once flinched or blinked either. Don't let these rumors of a horrid rape scene detour you from watching this, visually, it's not especially graphic, but emotionally it's difficult, of course.<br />What I found most interesting about the film is how they seemed to compare Alex' boyfriend (Vincent Cassel) with the rapist, right down to the \\"I wanna **** your ass\\" line. It makes you wonder why she would choose this womanizing animal over the caring Pierre. She tells him sometimes he can be so gentle. There are moments in the rape scene where we see the rapist be gentle. You have to wonder what the message is. All men are Mephisto I guess, like the man said at the beginning.<br />I disagree with the coupe people who complained the movie encouraged homophobia ect (the scene at the beginning) I think the movie was trying to show through Marcus' hate, ect that he was a bad person. (You didn't see Pierre behaving that way) just like the rapist's hate for women seemed to drive his violence.<br />Really interesting movie, highly recommended if you are not sensitive to the subject matter.
B00005JKC3|5.0|I think The Hulk is a great movie,the CG is awesome. In fact the hulk is the most advanced CG character to date. Im definitely going to buy this movie.
B00006L9ZT|5.0|This is a brilliantly conceived and powerfully executed recording of Wagner's Ring.  The sets, costumes, camera work, and direction all evoke Wagner's conception, from the waters of the Rhine to earth and gods in conflict.  It is convincingly acted and beautifully sung.  Morris is a superb Wotan; Zednick brings his uncanny insight and humor to Mime.  Salminen is extraordinary as Hagen.  I was only somewhat disappointed in Ludwig as Fricka.  Levine's conducting is intense, and the sound quality is excellent.
0553266306|4.0|Forsyth sets himself a problem with the theme of this book ;it is about an attempt to assassinate General de Gaule and ,as is widely known ,the man died of natural causes .Thus Forsyth denies himself one central tension-excitement about the outcome.That he still writes a brilliant and suspenseful thriller ,by concentrating on process rather than outcome ,is a testimony to his skills as fiction writer and  his background in journalism.<br />The book is written in a clinical ,detached style reminiscent of a police report ,or indeed non polemical investigative journalism.There are few stylistic flourishes and much technical detail .We are rarely made privy  to the way characters think or feel and this gives the book a documentary mood ; events feel viewed as from a distance lending the book an eerie and chilling feel.<br />The right wing OAS -a real organization -who feel that de Gaulle has betrayed France by granting Algerian independence hire the Jackal ,a professional ,to assassinate him .We learn little of the Jackal except that he is  a blond Englishman ,ruthless and efficient at his trade .As he lays his plans -new identity ,weapons ,location etc so the French authorities realise that he is an altogether tougher proposition than the fanatics who have tried to kill de Gaulle previously and the hunt is on.From that point on the book goes into overdrive and is almost unbearably suspenseful and gripping.<br />One of the very best thrillers ever and probably the best ever about a manhunt.

B00008EY9G|5.0|I wasn't expecting this movie to be engaging as it was, but in the same way Momento kept me wondering what's going on Identity successfully keeps you guessing. The connection of the two main stories and how they intertwine, the play of timeline, perception of reality, and exploring the mind of a killer and eerie location... (a down and out motel in the desert) all make this a pretty suspenful and interesting movie. kept me guessing and wanting more.<br />John Cusack, and Amanda Peet stood out in their performances, which also played in the stress of the movie as these two felt unlikely in the situations they were put in.... which helped the unpredictabilty of the film... Identity is a good old style supense film... (see also Momento...)
B00005T7I1|3.0|Less than a decade earlier, Warren Beatty directed himself to considerable critical acclaim in the film REDS.  But with 1990's DICK TRACY he stumbled badly: although it received considerable hype and numerous critical accolades for its art and sound design, the film fizzled at the box office, and these days you are more likely to find the film in a retail bargain bin than in some one's personal collection.<br />Even so, DICK TRACY isn't as bad as its detractors often claim.  The film has several things going for it, most particularly that deservedly lauded art design, which seeks to recreate the look and feel of &#34;golden age&#34; comic books.  Built in largely primary color and with a tremendous sense of line, the designs are among the most striking of the 1990s.  The make-up designs, which go to considerable length to recreate the look of the comic book characters, are also enjoyable.<br /><br />The film also has several memorable performances, and the most notable among these comes from someone who is has had little success on the big screen: Madonna. As femme fatale &#34;Breathless Mahoney,&#34; she looks good, has the best lines and delivers them with considerable spirit, and flawlessly performs the complex musical numbers specifically written for her by the legendary Stephen Sondheim.  (&#34;Sooner or Later&#34; may be single best thing she's done on film.)  Glenne Headly, as Tracy's steady girl Tess, also makes an impression, as do many of the cameo performers, who range from Dustin Hoffman to Kathy Bates and from Estelle Parsons to James Caan.<br /><br />But for all its memorable visuals and the occasional outstanding performance, DICK TRACY is an incredibly static film.  Although the art designers did a terrific job in capturing the look of comic book graphics, the cinematographer miscalculated in repeating the look in terms of camera setups, which are presented in a flat-frame style calculated to recreate comic book frames.  The result is a host of beautiful images without any motion dynamic at all, and over the course of its run the film develops a static quality that I personally found absolutely exhausting.<br /><br />The script doesn't help very much either.  The story finds our hero trying to put away Big Boy Caprice and being tempted away from Tess by Breathless in the process--and that's really all you can say about it one way or another.  And with one or two exceptions aside, the dialogue is as uninspired as the plot.  What with the camera locked down like the Rock of Gibraltar and the script dead in the water, it's hardly surprising that most of the performers reacted by offering performances so incredibly broad that most of their efforts feel acutely forced.<br /><br />I can understand why many people admire and even enjoy the film, but by the time the final credits rolled I myself was glad to see it go, and I'd recommend that you either borrow it or rent it before you go so far as to buy it.  As for the DVD, the picture and sound quality are great, but there are no extras of any kind.<br /><br />--GFT (Amazon.com Reviewer)--otion dynamic at all, and over the course of its run the film develops a static quality that I personally found absolutely exhausting.

B00007JVBI|4.0|Chan (pronounced Sean) Marshall has created a sound and evenly keeled album with You Are Free.  She really has honed a refreshingly unique sound.  From the first track &quot;Don't Blame You&quot; to &quot;Shaking Paper&quot; the album held my attention and prompted me to strain to make out Marshall's obscure and shadowy lyrics.  I agree that Marshall sort of flows into a melancholy P.J. Harvey-ish vein but would temper that kind of statement with her more folk sounding laments as heard on &quot;Good Woman&quot; and &quot;Fool&quot;.  These remind me of Neil Young during After the Goldrush, but with less urgency.   The album does kind of peter out after track 8, with the exception of the chilling track &quot;Names&quot;.  <BR>All in all a good album that evokes a lot of intimacy and ackward grace.  The songs resonate long after they've faded out.
B00009RDG8|3.0|This movie had a lot going for it; a plausibly good story-line, great actors in Jones and Del Toro, and a director with a proven (albeit distant) track record.  It did not live up to its' promise.  The acting was fairly good.  Tommy Lee Jones gives his standard (in his case that means &quot;good&quot;) performance but shows his willingness again to put his talent into lesser productions (remember &quot;Double Jeopardy&quot;?).  Benicio Del Toro has shown his talent in the past but is given little opportunity to do so in this movie.  His role is essentially non-verbal.  The other acting is adequate or better.<br />The main problem with this movie is the story-line.  We have seen the story of the returning special forces hero who can't handle society so he drifts away to the wilderness.  We're ready to see that again in this movie as the stage is properly set.  The problem is that the secenery changes too often and too fast.  The actual wilderness scenes are very well done and the photography is excellent.  I give the director his due on the first third of the movie.  But our anti-hero is too quickly captured and the action switches to an urban surrounding.  There is a lot of action throughout the movie and nobody seems to be able to get a solid hold on Del Toro's character (including, at times, Del Toro himself).  Ultimately the scene changes from downtown Portland to the wilderness again.  You tell me how two men on foot can get from one extreme to the other in a brief amount of time and find each other so quickly.  Not only that but they do so while the whole of the federal, state and local law enforcement agencies with all of their technology and resources are unable to do so.  It gets worse.  Our anti-hero has the time to forge a knife while waiting for Tommy Lee who takes time to create his prehistoric blade.  Their fight is not choreographed very well and we are again pressed to accept that a series of deeply embedded wounds will not slow either combatant down.It was too much for me to accept although I'm probably too pragmatic for my own good at times.  <br />There are scenes that are meant to embellish the meaning of the movie.  Our hero, Tommy Lee Jones, is first met tracking a wounded wolf.  He catches up with the wolf, removes the trap from its' paw and puts a healing solution on the wound.  I was waiting for the wolf to lick his hand.  This, we come to understand, is what he will be called upon to do for Benicio.  There's a children's hide and seek game in an airport that seemed, at first, meaningless.  Of course, the meaning is found in Tommy Lee Jones telling the girl where the boy has hidden.  <br />The time of the movie (95 minutes) puts this in the B movie class and much of what happens in it substantiates that.  It could have been a better movie than it is.  But it isn't.
B00005JLSE|5.0|The movie contained on the DVD contains everything you could possibly look for in a movie. It has style, flair, deceit and fabulous acting. Renee Zellweger and Cathrine Zeta-Jones are just two of the actresses who deliever Oscar-caliber (and honored) performances. The extras include the deleted song \\"Class\\" which though it was cut is great to watch. I recommend this DVD to all viewers, it is one of my favorites.

B00006IUL7|4.0|NJ, reviews are not for revealing plot development secrets. <br />Your assessment of Pacino as a great actor is a judgement call, but how can we trust the judgement of someone who gives away plot lines in a review? (Personally, I think Pacino has an uncanny ability to ruin an otherwise-superb movie, but that is beside the point.)
B000002AH9|3.0|Yes...I understand what previous reviewers are feeling and saying, viv-a-vis the haunting, scarred, weak voice of Billie on this, set against the lush arrangements of Ray Ellis. &quot;You've Changed&quot; was described by one as being haunting &quot;like a car accident&quot;. I agree. I am also a lover of jazz instrumentalists (and Billie's voice certainly sounds like an instrument) with strings and good arrangements. All that being said, I simply do not think that this one is a &quot;good&quot; one. Music should lift one's soul as well as nourish it. I think that Billie's later Verve recordings stretched the limits of that description enough. I feel that this one crosses that line. I love 99% of Billie Holiday's music - I just can't listen to this one. 3 stars simply because of what all of the other reviewers said. This recording, to me, is almost morbid in its appeal.
0784010501|1.0|...was the European release title. But since I've never been very much impressed by her as a 'singer',and because I've been very much impressed by her (lack of) talent as an actress (I've seen only some trailers and it was more than I could stand), I dare to say the truth: I will be very happy not to see her in bed, and to leave her to all who appreciate provocative vulgarity...and I'm very far of beeing prudish.
B0000AUHQT|2.0|I have not read the book, however I am a huge Law and Order fan and have been on a Sam Waterston kick and decided to watch this movie since he was in it.  I have to say that I am devoting 1.7 of the two stars to his performance it was one of the only good things about this film.  Mia Farrow's performance was breathtaking...ly awful.  I sincerely hope that she is a more substantial person in real life than in this movie.  I had a hard time even finishing the entire movie because her performance just seems to grate on your nerves until you sincerely wish that she would commit suicide, and unfotunately Bruce Dern is not much further behind.  He comes across as someone that is a monster but he just can not seem to convey it all that well.  THere is this whiny and wimpy quality to his performance which makes you glad that he and his bimbo wife \\"suffer\\" as much as they do in this movie.  Robert Redford is gorgeous and while he lacks emotion in some areas over all he is a brighter spot in the movie.  I read a review that said that he didn't some off as needy enough but I think that there was a definite air of neediness, however there is only so much insecurity a man as smootha nd beautiful as Redford can convey.  The ending to the movie was powerful and I have to admit that I cried because of the way that Gatsby got treated by the woman he truly loved.  So shallow and selfish that she couldn't manage to call or pause for a nanosecond in her life for a man who was so obviously in love with her.  So the last .3 of the two stars goes to the ending of the movie and while Sam's performance was fantastic it is nice to see he has matured as an actor and the only thing that I would wish different about his character would be that he would stand up to Daisy and Tom at the end and explain what selfish jerks they are.  Overall if you are not a Redford or Waterston fan this movie was just to thoroughly annoying to sit through.
B0000AI44Q|4.0|A very cohesive solid album, but rather than extol it, I'd rather address the reviewer who asks &quot;If this is the Worst Neil album ever?&quot;  Obviously, he/she feels differently.<br />1. Complaint: the lyrics are banal.<BR>Answer: Neil is speaking through plain spoken small town folks.  His voice is true to his characters.<br />There is nothing new under the sun. Therefore, we look for inspired delivery.  I absolutely love the delivery when Neil's Granpa says, &quot;It ain't an honor to be on TV.  And it ain't a duty either.&quot;<br />Since I work in electric policy, I do love when Sun Green takes on the semi-fictitious &quot;Power-Corp.&quot;  I'm not sure it is my speakers, but my one production complaint is that the megaphone lyrics should ring out more clearly.  <br />Compaint 2. That the music never goes anywhere. <BR>Answer 2:  Except for Sun Green, these lives generally don't go anywhere! From the start, the best Neil (ALL NEIL!) matches the music to the content. Do you want &quot;Grandpa's Interview&quot; to sound like Southern Man? I don't think so. If you need that, play that. Furthermore, Neil is giving detached omniscient narrative.  There is enough melodramatic impassioned first person in the arts.  This is not that. He already wrote &quot;Down by the River.&quot; Neil is not going to write the exact same song twice. Even professional reviewers seem to make this type of mistake.  Neil knows just how far or little the travels or &quot;goes!&quot; It is exactly how he wants it, or it is not released.  With a novice artist, you can ask this question. If it is Neil, you can't ask that question -- you must ask WHY the music doesn't seem to go anywhere. <br />This reviewer reminds me of two fans that I saw commenting on &quot;Going Home&quot; of &quot;Are You Passionate.&quot;  They had no idea why a song that opens with an image of Custer's Last Stand would end abruptly and unexpectedly! And there's another reason to study history! And generally not one of the reason's that you're fed.<br />I find the music to be a different flavor of smoldering and the melodies quite sweet. I'm headed for another play.
B000056NX5|3.0|Watching this dvd for the first time I was shocked. This thing is out there for decades, and I'd expect the new versions get better, learning from the predecessors. Instead they get worse every time.   There was a fine version  with Ian Gillan in the beginning. Then the film version I found with voices less fitting on the LP. But much of that was compensated on the screen at least.<BR>Here we have voices MUCH WORSE than those early versions. And the play is mediocre too, at least at some very important parts.<br />The staging itself I like.  The operator's work is excellent. And picture quality could get THX certification hands down.  And the look of the characters is used well too. The main roles still drag the whole feeling down.  Judas is pretty lame in the first part of the show. Later on he gets better. I like how he use his face, and it was cut in repetedly observing what happens to Jesus. <br />Jesus is plain bad overall.  Singing performace bad to mediocre, acting perfoirmance just mediocre. Like one having absolutely no clue what to do with the role.   The central and most important song of JCSS, Getsemane clearly shows that. The central section is okey, but start and especially the ending shows the wrong spirit. Taht is unacceptable, after having the 1973 film showing how to do that well.<br />The other roles are so-so too, Caifas' singing i sometimes odd in the first part, improving later. Annas pretty much rocks. Pilate is pale singing the dream, but is near good later, but can't do it to the end, the 'you innocent puppet' is played just bad. <BR>Mary's singing seems impossible to spoil, playing is generally okey, could be better too. <br />My suggestion: watch it before buying.  If you don't have the 1973 film, buy that one.   <BR>Also, don't judge other really useful's stuff by this.  Joseph is excellent dn must-buy. Cats is pretty good too. That adds to my disappointment with this piece.
0790736039|3.0|I was anticipating a pretty good flick, as it is probably the most famous of the Stephen King book-into-movie productions, next to &quot;The Shining&quot;, but I was disapointed with it.  (FYI: I'm not some moron who's going to say the special effects were bad, I don't judge based on stuff that wasn't invented yet.)  The acting itself was pretty good, and Tim Curry plays a good It, but some of scenes seemed cheezy after reading the book.<br />As with most King movies, the better scenes from the book aren't included, which is a shame because these are what King is most famous for.<br />I think I would recommend this if you are a die-hard Stephen King fan, or if you have never read a one, and you appreciate a nice ol' horror flick.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This is one of the most interesting and sci-fi real stories I have ever seen.  I like the more realistic future shown; ships do get dirty, food is always an issue, police force is lacking and pirates are all over.  These everything is clean and civil is getting very old.  <br />The casting was awesome.  I could really get into the story, the actors really brought the world to life.  If they ever read this I would like to give you a HUGE \\"THANKS!!!!\\"<br />I do want to say at least once, \\"Who ever decided that Firefly was not worth at least three seasons is a bit out of touch with the public.\\"<br />I cannot wait to see this show to DvD.  I just hope the writers, crew and cast stay together for future works.<br />Thanks Again!!!<br />Dean Alan
B0000042MY|3.0|This Cd was much of what I expected.  However I was severely disappointed when It came to I will find you- Clannad, which was one of the major factors in me getting this rather than just picking up the score at my local department store.  In the movie this particular song is several minutes long with a number of verses, but on the cd they give you 1:42 which is just the first verse, you don't even get the verse for which the song was named.
B000001Y2U|4.0|This is a very good album, though please note this is nothing like linkin park and other mtv radio friendly bands so if your looking for that then quit reading this review, but if your looking for some fine depressing industrial metal then keep reading. <br />This album is very good(like i said before), Marilyn Manson sings how he feels and shares his thoughts on religion and more. What i mainly like about Marilyn Manson is that he can make such a depressing song sound so catchy e.g. the beautiful people. And his songs are very unforgettable, they will get stuck in your head and after a while you will find yourself singing alonge to his songs even if you disagree with what he is saying and they will grow more and more on you. Some of Marilyn Manson's great songs include &quot;the beautiful people&quot; a manson classic and one of Mansons biggest crowd pleasers, &quot;little horn&quot; a fast paced Manson song, &quot;mister superstar&quot; a great song about how tough life can be for famous people, &quot;kinderfield&quot; a rather depressing song, &quot;the reflecting god&quot; possibly Manson's most powerful song on the album and last but not least &quot;man that you fear&quot; is a great ending song. Very depressing too.<br />Now onto the negatives about this album. The guitar riffs are a little repetetive, so if you are a little fussy with guitar riffs, then keep in mind that twiggy doesn't offer the best guitar riffs. Now i might just mention a few filler tracks. &quot;cryptorchid&quot; the stupidest song on the album, lyrics seem a little cheesy, &quot;wormboy&quot; Manson's voice fails to shine in this song. <br />As you can see i didn't have much to type for negatives meaning this is obviously a good album though as trying to be a fair reviewer i do not think this album deserves 5 stars(maybe a 4.5 but not 5). To me a 5 star album would ba an album i always listen to and can't get enough of and basically no flaws at all. <br />The 16 songs on this album are divided into 3 cycles. Cycle 1: &quot;the heirophant&quot;, Cycle 2: &quot;inauguration of the worm&quot;,<BR>Cycle 3: disintegrator rising.<br />The lyrics on this album are very depressing so for the faint hearted stay away. The lyrics deal with christianity, the government, capitalism, his life etc. So if you would hate to hear Marilyn Manson tell you a bit about his life as a boy forced into christianity by his parents, abused by kids, humiliated by teachers, then you'd best stay away from this album. So yeah this album is not for everyone, no not necesarilly by age, im 13, have no problem with listening to his thoughts, this album is just not really for christians, faint hearted people and especially people who are not open minded. <br />Anyway now that i have told you a fair bit about this cd i feel like listening to it in my discman. Hope this review helped. (plays cd in discman)
B00005JMD3|1.0|I have given in to the fact that Hollywood director's are penny-pinching sell-outs. But to shove a Dr. Pepper can into the spotlight every fifteen minutes while filming a movie about the force which fights and dies to protect people they don't even know was, I thought, beyond even them.  But hey, by today's standards, the honour of fighting and fallen heroes is a small price to pay for a couple more big explosions and sunken bullet-holes.<br />Beyond that, I found it a bit less than subtle in these chaotic, hateful times to use a \\"frog\\", as Samuel L Jackson delicately puts it on more than one occasion, as the number one enemy of the United States police.  Using racial slurs against the number one democratic enemy of America's war?  In a major Hollywood movie?  <br />To take a Michael Moore-esque view on one final note, we see common thugs and low-lives with automatic weapons wounding and killing innocents, and never even question how such dangerous weapons got into their hands, but somehow this is justified  when a bunch of guys in black kill them off one by one.  We've come so far that using violence to counteract violence is the first, last and only solution to the problem.  Obviously, there isn't really any choice in situations like this, but at least question how things have come to the point where there IS no other choice, even in Hollywood films.<br />Ok this is a movie review, so let's finish with comments about the film itself; cliche action sequences, lukewarm acting, two-dimensional storyline.
B000002J1U|5.0|It's amazing how often a stellar album like Led Zeppelin III gets ignored in lieu of the \\"classic\\" IV. Maybe it's due to the whole Stairway To Heaven obsession, but fans are missing out on an album that is at least equal to the landmark II.<br />Yes, it's Led Zeppelin softest, most acoustic album. But seeing as Page's acoustic skills are mindblowing, this hardly seems like a bad thing. III does feature its share of hard rockers, as well--the galloping FM hit Immigrant Song, the jubilant Celebration Day, and the fun Out On The Tiles. Also, there is a brilliant blues epic that serves as the album's centerpiece, Since I've Been Loving You. Page belts out a classic blues riff, an organ player (John Paul Jones?) pours on the soul, Bonham blasts his kit, and Plant intones perhaps his best, most heartfelt vocal performance ever. On the hierarchy of Led Zeppelin epics, this stands in the company of The Rain Song, In My Time Of Dying, When The Levee Breaks, and The Lemon Song.<br />The first clue that this album is not a sequel to II is dropped with the acoustic Friends, which also features string backing and excellent playing of the tabla drums by Bonham. It is probably one of my favorites on the album and occupies a unique spot in the Led Zeppelin canon. The second side of the album is almost all acoustic, starting with the Ledbelly blues scorcher Gallows Pole. Tangerine features lap steel guitars and a laid-back feel, a bold move for this hard blues band. My pick for the best song on side 2 has to be the energetic Bron-Y-Aur Stomp (a completely different song from Bron-Y-Aur on Physical Graffitti). The album ends with a strangely psychedelic rendition of Hats Off To Roy Harper that you either love or hate. I happen to enjoy it, though it took a while to get used to.<br />In my opinion, this album is more satisfying and consistent than IV or Houses Of The Holy, and that's no mean feat. Every Zeppelin fan should at least give this album a listen. If you're new to the band, buy II and Physical Graffitti first, then get this. You won't be disappointed.d, buy II and Physical Graffitti first, then get this. You won't be disappointed.
B00008EY9G|3.0|The beginning of the movie plays out like an Independence day(I hated that movie). The ensemble class of characters converge on this motel. People start turning up dead but the thing I wasn't expecting was that I started to care for these characters. I was rooting for the Cusack(who was suprisingly very hunky in this film!) character and the Peete character to hook up but then I felt cheated with the movie twist. So I came away from the film feeling dissapointed.
B0000636UN|4.0|Sheryl Crow is one of my favourite female artists because her songs have fantastic lyrics, catchy melodies and excellent production. I purchased her first three studio albums (\\"Tuesday Night Music Club,\\" \\"Sheryl Crow\\" and \\"The Globe Sessions\\") a few months ago and fell in love with them. I connected to her music in a way I never have before, which made me worried about buying Sheryl's fourth - and latest - studio album, \\"C'mon, C'mon.\\" I decided as a fan it was kind of my duty to buy it, so I did.<br /><br />It arrived a few weeks ago, and I was - as I expected - rather disappointed with it. It did not, however, leave my CD player as I was forcing myself to like it. I gave up after a few days, but some of the songs stuck in my head. I went back to listen to it a second time around because I wanted to, and I found myself liking it. As the title of this review states, this is Sheryl Crow's worst album, but that does not necessarily make it a bad one.<br /><br />The two big hits from this album are \\"Soak Up The Sun\\" and \\"Steve McQueen.\\" Both songs are fantastic summer hits and further prove Sheryl's versatility. They have class and rhythm, much like \\"You're An Original\\" which is another stand out song from the album. The album's title track is a good song but the vocals are not up to scratch, while \\"Lucky Kid\\" is a pure rock anthem with blood-curling vocals in a screechy manner. \\"Diamond Road\\" has a fantastic chorus with some very catchy and interesting vocals. The melody is very memorable and reminds me of days when I would laze around on summer days with my friends in country fields from my childhood. \\"Hole In My Pocket\\" is in a similar vein with a funky guitar that just makes you want to sway to the beat.<br /><br />Let's not be biased and forget to highlight the flaws of this album. There are a couple of songs that are pretty rubbish such as \\"It's So Easy\\" and \\"Abilene,\\" but these are easily forgivable. While the up-tempo songs from C'mon, C'mon are almost a new sound altogether for Sheryl, she remains her best when belting out the rock ballads. \\"Safe And Sound\\" has to be the album's highlight, and one of Sheryl's best songs ever. She performed this song at the 2002 MTV VMA's in a tribute to the victims of September 11th, and she was on fire! The chorus is awesome, and the song dies down after two and a half minutes into Sheryl is whispering. Then the song explodes once more and she sings her heart out - truly emotional and inspiring. \\"Over You\\" drags a bit, but it takes a few listens to fully sink in. \\"It's Only Love\\" is another soaring country ballad that captures your heart with the wonderful chorus and emotional vocals. The album ends with the eerie and majestic \\"Weather Channel\\" which sounds like a left-over from The Globe Sessions. The lyrics are thought-provoking and are set in a stream-of-consciousness style.<br /><br />The noticeable difference between this album and Sheryl's three other studio albums is the guest-stars. Her first three albums had practically none, but stars such as Lenny Kravitz, Natalie Maines, Don Henley, Liz Phair, Kid Rock, Stevie Nicks, Keith Richards and even Gwyneth Paltrow star on this album! The album has a much more commercial feel to it, which gives off the impression that they are trying to sell more records than previous albums - that and the fact that the album's artwork is solely focused on Sheryl and her body. Two of the pictures feature her in just a bikini top! This isn't the Sheryl from ten years ago...<br /><br />OVERALL GRADE: 7/10<br /><br />When everything is said and done, Sheryl Crow has succeeded here in making another great record. It isn't as good as her first three albums, but it's a good try. When the album is good, it's very good, but when it's bad, it's bad; some songs are brilliant and some are bad, which meaning there's not much middle ground. The negative reviews of this album on here are so wrong it's funny. Such a shame that people can't accept good, solid and traditional rock 'n' roll. With a Greatest Hits collection set for release before the year is out, Sheryl Crow's career looks set to go from strength to strength. I await her next studio album with much anticipation.llection set for release before the year is out, Sheryl Crow's career looks set to go from strength to strength.

0385504209|5.0|I am a thirteen year old girl who lives in a really small town. There isn't much to do, so I have always been a very active reader. I bought this book, and started reading it about a week later. Once I picked it up, I couldn't put it down. I had it finished in less than two days time. I loved it! It is an amazing book, I suggest it to anyone and everyone!

B000002LR6|5.0|Psalm 69 is the summation of almost every major theme in heavy metal for the last 20 years. Ministry took speed metal and mechanized it, giving it a permanent edge. They added grunge and sampling (in \\"Scarecrow\\"),  and noise collage that the Melvins and John Zorn (among others) would explore (in \\"Grace\\"). They mock christianity in the same vein as Black Sabbath (\\"Psalm 69\\"). Then they bring in Gibby Haynes to sing one of the most insane songs of the decade, \\"Jesus Built My Hot Rod.\\" That song, all by itself, is worth the price of this disc.<br />Ten years after its release, this album is still brutal, funny, and disturbing. You can call it industrial, but it's really a heavy metal album stripped of all the fat.
1563896656|3.0|The idea behind this book is much, much better than the execution. Kevin O'Neill's illustration style is unique, but he sucks the action out of every panel. The characters are very stiff. Scenes of explosions and fist-fights are static --- you see the action before and after, but nothing in between.<br />The story is hard to follow. Honestly, I had no idea what was going on until the *third* time I read the book. Alan Moore seems to have cut any \\"establishing shots,\\" dumping you into different places without introduction, and keeping character motives secret. (Compare this to WATCHMEN, in which every location is identified and each character is carefully examined as they are introduced.)<br />To make matters worse, too many pages are rendered so dark, you can't see the artwork. Notice how the big splash page at the end of chapter 2 (\\"limehouse...\\") is too dim to see all the carefully-rendered details drawn by O'Neill.<br />What's good about this? Well, first of all the whole idea is so good, you can justify the effort to get involved. Moore and O'Neill could do this series for the next ten years and it would just get better. Second, despite the repressive Victorian setting, they've have thrown in a lot of sex (including  an invisible man fondling girls) and blood (slit throats, torture, and more). The ponderous plot is given constant injections of mayhem and titillation to keep you interested.<br />If you don't know Alan Moore's work, don't start here. (Start with WATCHMEN and FROM HELL.) If you know his work --- and if you  enjoyed Kevin O'Neill's work on MARSHALL LAW --- you'll like this. And it's only going to get better . . . the next book combines Edgar Rice Burroughs' Barsoom with HG Wells' War of the Worlds. Who could resist that?
0345448898|5.0|I read all of these books as they came out and have recently reread them all.I have again marvelled at how good they really are!!Pullman has amazing width in the scope of these books, they all interconnect, yet stand alone beautifully. The books are an amazing set of adventures against evil,power and selfishness, some have even compared them to \\"Paradise Lost\\". Northern Lights follows the story of Lyra, she lives in a world not quite our own... the second follows a child in our own universe who uses a knife to cut into other dimensions, the last shows the two children nearing puberty and losing some of the power of childhood. Their loss in this book is handled well by Pullman and reminded me of that netherworld of teenagehood when you are not really anything and life is starting to become emotionally very scary... i have given this an overall rating of 5 but actually my favourite is \\"The Subtle Knife\\" as it is about our universe and the problems a young boy with a mentally ill parent encounters here, as well as his \\"magical\\" problems in the other worlds he travels to... this is a great adventure and will be read for generations by adults and children alike.... you should read it...or listen to the audio tapes released by the BBC, a radio play of the books.... and you should also look at the other books Pullman has written. (My other favourite is \\"Ruby in the Smoke\\"... very different than these but really cool about Victorian women)
0804106304|2.0|Okay, so i have not read The Joy Luck Club, but rather an excerpt from it entitled &quot;Rules of the Game.&quot; I read this in school. <br />It is about Waverly Jong, a young Chinese-American girl growing up in Chinatown. She is a chess prodigy, beating everyone. Win after win, her mother begins to brag aboout her, showing her off to everyone else. There were many morals, themes, etc. inside of the story. i thought it was a pretty good story. I am Asian.<br />However my classmates, all who are white, took from this story different things. Instead of only seeing a girl with these struggles, they saw a CHINESE girl. I thought, &quot;Yeah, she's Chinese. So what?&quot; <BR>But then they went into the Asian stereotyping. &quot;I have an Asian friend-she's real smart too.&quot; &quot;Yeah my friend is Asian, he gets such good grades.&quot; &quot;Uh huh, my friend who is Asian is the best at math!&quot; <BR>This angered me soo much, and completely ruined the story for me. Stereotyping ANYONE is so wrong and hurtful and annoying! Please, if you read this, stop!
1573226521|5.0|I had heard that this book was full of suspense and nonstop events. Once I picked it up, it just could not be put down. Seriously one of the best books I have read. Alex Garland makes it seem as if he really did experience this. To every last detail I still think it happend. I had also heard that the ending was crazy (which it is!)and that it wasnt in the movie.<BR> (Which i still have to see) Overall, it was a great read. For anyone who loves good (I mean really really good) books, this is it.

0385504209|1.0|Simply as a page-turner, this book is fairly effective. Most readers agree that it is engrossing and will keep your attention to the end. However, I am completely amazed that so many are taking this author's premises seriously. To those who are so inclined, I challenge you to do the research for yourself and see just how accurate, or inaccurate, this book really is.<br />Brown quotes the old saying that the victor gets to write the history; apparently, the novelist is supposed to have the same prerogative. This book sounds as if it's been exhaustively researched, but it is entirely without historical basis. In fact, in many places Brown's claims are in direct opposition to historical fact.<br />Symbology: Brown writes elaborate meanings for many symbols. Where did he get this information? I can't find any support for his explanation of the pentacle, for example, even from pagan sources! The rest of his symbology is just as problematic.<br />Leonardo da Vinci: Brown's &quot;facts&quot; about Leonardo are based on rumor and speculation. Where he does use history, he usually gets it wrong. I suggest you check out Bruce Boucher's article in the NY Times (8/3/03), &quot;Does 'The Da Vinci Code' Crack Leonardo?&quot; He asks the question, &quot;How much does this murder mystery have to do with the real Leonardo? The short answer is not much, and the author's grasp of the historical Leonardo is shaky.&quot; He says there is &quot;more sangria than sangreal&quot; here.<br />Secret societies: Here again, his &quot;research&quot; consists of speculation and myth. For another view, take a look at &quot;The Priory of Sion Hoax&quot; by Robert Richardson.<br />History of Christianity: Here his work is absolutely appalling. Brown seeks to entirely rewrite history to fit his plot. Christianity existed for almost 300 years before Constantine came to power. The beliefs of the early church are very well-documented. To claim that Constantine was responsible for the church worshipping Christ as God is historically laughable. Whether you believe Jesus Christ is God or not, it is historically incontrovertible that the early church believed just that.<br />Here again, the author often reverses known historical facts. The NT gospels, which Brown depicts as later revisions, were actually written in the 1st century---three of them fairly soon after the death of Christ. The Nag Hammadi gospels, which Brown refers to as the &quot;earlier gospels,&quot; were written hundreds of years later and obviously lack the historical integrity of the NT gospels. Check them out for yourself.<br />Brown claims that the Nicene Council voted on the deity of Christ. They actually voted to determine whether Arius was a heretic. Arius was teaching that Christ was God, but not in the same way that the Father was God. Out of over 300 bishops, only 2 supported Arius. Brown refers to this as a &quot;relatively close vote.&quot;<br />As I read this book, I began to compile a list of the author's blatant inaccuracies. It quickly became dizzying. Practically every historical claim either contains inaccuracies or is outright false.  Dan Brown is either completely ignorant regarding the history of which he writes, or he is counting on the ignorance of his readers. I find it difficult to believe that his research was really this shoddy. To produce even a work of fiction that uses such blatantly inaccurate claims of historical fact is arrogant and dishonest. That this book is being hailed the way it is should be a concern to all who love and seek truth.Christ as God is historically laughable.

B0000AQS0F|5.0|You have to wonder what the powers that be were thinking when they cancelled this show. Firefly was intelligent, portrayed a unique, realistic final frontier, had a great cast, and was one of the rare series that actually had no sound in space. It tackled issues in a mature way and had characters who were very human. It was funny, creative, twisted, and always engaging. Firefly had the potential to be better than anything on TV. <BR>It also had a Friday night death slot and a bunch of executives who didn't love it nearly as much as us fans.<BR>Now, instead of Mal and his crew, we have &quot;reality TV&quot; and the forlorn hope of someday getting a DVD of the show. If we're lucky, it will have the four episodes of the show that were filmed but never released after the series' cancellation. Please do right by us, O Powers That Be, and give us our show back, even if it's just on DVD. What we don't want is more reality dreck.
B00005JLWN|4.0|In the future (this time), WWIII happened and humanity has lost it's way (as usual). After the aftermath, the government decided to become fascists. NOW, the human race is controlled by a drug  that makes people completely emotionless to prevent war and all that. An elite team lead by some guy (CHRISTIAN BALE) eliminates sex offenders (people who feel), all forms of art work, puppy dogs (I cried over that) and anything that will make a human emotional cuz feeling is illegal! But the dude forgot to take his dosage one day and starts feeling and sees the world in a whole different way! So now he finds himself working with sex offenders to battle the fascist emotionless government! <br />This is probably the first movie to ever come up with the concept GUN KATA. I loved that! This is an original film without a doubt! A very good story, spectacular acting, awsome action, and original! I predict in the futrue that other people will rip-off the GUN KATA concept and use it for their own movies! I'll bet my life on it! My only complaint is the film should of  focused more on the action rather than making it a sci-fi thriller but that doesn't take away anything from this movie! Still highly recommended movie!
B00001PE4D|4.0|Dangerous Liasons, the book, was fascinating in itself.  It was also controversial, much like Cruel Intentions (the film adaption of Dangerous Liasons during a year when film directors wanted everything written 'in high school').  The kiss between Sarah Michelle Gellar and the naive school-girl under her wing was extremely shocking to many.  It was one of the first mainstream step to make such behavior accepted by the movie-going public.  <br />The performances in this film were absolutely fabulous.  It is a love-story of the high calibre, for isn't any good love-story the overcoming of personal flaws for the sake of one who we love?  Ryan Philippe's character had to completely change his opinion of love and sex and dating to accomplish the task of winning the girl.  The normal beats of a romance were right on target, but there were interesting twists added with the cliche 'teen movie bet' addition.  In the end, the story is a compelling look at life and love for the disaffected and privileged.  It is reminiscent of Bret Easton Ellis' work.
B000066NW0|4.0|I wouldn't say that Avril Lavigne has a ver punk-ish style, but I also wouldn't say she is a poser.  Who invents the definition for poser, anyway?  Although she does not write her own music, I have to defend her at the point where some people say she can't even play the guitar!  this is totally untrue, she CAN play the guitar (in fact she taught herself)and although her voice isn't very trained, it definitly fits the type of pop rock music she sings.  The CD Let Go is a great buy for people like me, and others who can relate to the songs.  *My fav songs are Anything but Ordinary and Things I'll never Say*  So stop calling her a poser and a bad singer because, well, should we compare her voice to that of a rapper?
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Ok. So you can tell the CGI Neo from Keanu himself. Ok, there are some script incoherences. So what? You're watching the sequel of a movie that changed the way movies and advertising are done, a movie that is complete in every aspect and that remains faithful to all Sci-Fi great topics. But you should also remember that the creators of this phenomenon are two youngsters, who like comics, kung-fu movies, anime and videogames. It's logical to me that they included a sex-scene. And that doesn't demerit the philosophical values of the movie. A friend of mine even tried to convince me that this movies are based on Gurdjieff's philosophical system.<BR>I don't know about most people, but those of my friends who didn't like \\"Reloaded\\" didn't like it because they didn't understand the Architect's explanation. I did, so I liked it.
B0000549B0|4.0|The movie Harvey is about a man (Jimmy Stewart) who imagines a giant bunny named Harvey.  What follows is an odd, sometimes humerous plot that will leave you in tears.  I saw this movie alone and by the end, I was bawling and remembering my stuffed bunny from my childhood.  WARNING: you may cry during this movie.  Make sure you get some tissues before it starts!
B00006RIO7|4.0|I enjoyed the movie, but the music absolutely blew me away!      I greatly appreciated the fact that the actors & actresses did their own singing (& dancing) ... it's nice to see evidence of their true talent occasionally.  Listening to the soundtrack makes me want to watch the movie again, just to see the parts where they're doing the 'scenes' from the soundtrack (which is most of the movie, *?*).    The only reason I felt this didn't deserve a '5 star' rating is simply that Queen Latifah's rendition of \\"He Had It Comin'\\" (Track 17) was so far removed from the movie, in my opinion it just absolutely doesn't belong on this soundtrack.  (Her other contributions to this movie, musically & otherwise, were fantastic I thought!)  Track 18 is only slightly better, but at least it's a little jazzy, not the hip-hop rap stuff that so definitely is NOT what this movie & music were all about.    If you at all enjoyed the movie, I think it's safe to say you'll really enjoy the soundtrack.
0375704027|3.0|37-year-old businessman Watanabe recalls his days as an 'ordinary' University student in the 70s and Norwegian Wood is his story.Through his narrating,the reader knows very convincing characters like Naoko (his beloved,ethereal gal whose importance I believe is pivotal as a deceptively simple romance for readers looking for a poignant 'love story'),very charming Reiko(who also has her strange,tantalising story to tell) and fickle,sensitive and frank Midori who, genuinely loves Watanabe.<br />Norwegian Wood surely deserves more than three stars for the author's deeply insightful perspective for all characters,including the lonely,young one-night-stander Watanabe.Obviously,the characters are so true-to-life that they could be strangers standing beside you,young adults reading Thomas Mann at a cafe or chatting in the pub with jazz buzzing around,or somebody playing piano in the restaurant you are sitting in.<br />Yet,from the author's pen,every character is bestowed a kind of tenderness ,sympathy and helplessness with their plights.Trust your intuition,the characters have no way out although they've tried their best like you and I.<br />The reason why I give it a three-star is the book doesn't give me what some reviewers have felt upon finishing.While admiring the author's sharp portraits of the characters(in fact,its so good that it doesn't feel you are reading Fiction at all!),as a reader I would have expected a louder,more engaging if not all- fair voice in a novel,instead of a blander,quieter piece like Norwegian Wood that reads deceptively like some popular pulps.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|I had never listened to any Cash before, I had just written him off as being a country and western singer (I don't really like C&amp;W). But once I heard this album I become a fan. It's hard to believe that at 70+ he is winning over a whole new audience.<br />Fantastic album, highly recommended.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Even if this is a demanding record, it's really misguided to say that the music lacks structure. To me, it seems much tighter structured than &quot;Tales&quot; or most of the stuff Yes have been doing in the last twenty years. The building-up of tension in &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; is way beyond &quot;Close to the Edge&quot;. Frankly, I think CTTE (the title track, at least - I can hear the stones coming!) has dated far more than this album. The technology and the soundscapes are awesome, and some of it was pioneering work for this time (some of the synths used by Moraz, for example). But in '74, this must have seemed a very provoking record.<BR>Even if &quot;Gates&quot; starts out in a flowery, warm mood, after barely a minute the first menacing streaks can be heard. Plainly, the band intended it to be that way: there's a roughness, a tension and a metallic sheen right from the start which is in effective contrast with Anderson's patently heroic lyrics about fighting for the just cause. <BR>When I got to know this record - in the eighties - I asked myself how far Jon Anderson is earnest in his &quot;call to arms&quot; and at what points he might be blood-curdlingly ironic, ripping off patriotic and religious rhetoric. The point seems to be that he doesn't know himself to 100%; he enters the part lika an actor and the power of the track just sweeps him away. Steve Howe has said later that Jon was &quot;very much the leader of the group, and he could be really Napoleonic at times&quot; so he may have envisaged himself as the 2warrior king&quot; he is singing about. But the music and the singing seem to get filled with subconscious feelings which take control of it all. <BR>It's an amazing piece in constructive terms too, the ruthless propulsion and the sound effects at the heart of it make &quot;Gates&quot; a blistering depiction of war. Maybe it's a just battle, but a fight all the same that leaves scars for many years to come. And the ending (which we also get in single edit here), does it really resolve the tensions? I don't think it's a plain &quot;happy end&quot;. It is a sort of catharsis, but the shadows of the fighting seem to fall over the music till the very end. On &quot;Tales&quot;, &quot;Ritual&quot; closed on the tonic, in a peaceful mood. &quot;Gates&quot; ends in a scale of slowly rising notes, but it ends one step below the tonic where you'd have felt the music coming to a rest. The doubts about the future are still hanging around. <BR>Ultimately, I think they were asking &quot;how far can one really justify a war by promising a paradise after it's won? And if you go for a revolution, how much blood and suffering should you accept to make things better?&quot; Questions that many people just didn't want asked in 1974 - neither left-wing terrorists, nor Richard Nixon and his supporters , nor the junta of Pinochet in Chile. Yes managed really good to show how conflicts live on and on if no one stops to ask questions about their morality, and they do it with terrific focus and energy.<BR>The other two main tracks on the album are great sidepieces to the central painting. &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; is fun (don't miss the &quot;gorilla chorus&quot; at the end! Well, you can't, really...) and the swing of the music is quite unlike any other Yes track I've heard.<BR>&quot;To be Over&quot;, finally, fuses different kinds of music - country, far Eastern music, English church hymns and rock - with a gentle power all its own, gorgeous guitar and electric sitar from Howe, and Chris Squire's thundering and yet delicately phrased bass cascades, and a magical feeling for pauses. &quot;Be ready to be loved&quot; is the final line - the lyrics could be about feeling liberated as a person, or about feeling united with a sacred force. In the end, they deal with feeling at home, loved and accepted, no matter what troubles one has seen. The theme points forward to many songs they would do later on.
B00005UK1F|4.0|4.5 stars.  I applaud all those involved in the making of this album.  While not exactly on par with \\"OK Computer\\" by Radiohead or \\"Dark Side of the Moon\\" by Pink Floyd, both of the aforementioned albums leap to mind when listening to \\"Light of Day, Day of Darkness.\\"   Praise, indeed!  There is intricacy everywhere, each moment holding the promise of something interesting. I was impressed and had a full-on buzz after only one spin.  There is so much going on with this CD that after ten spins I am still picking up details in the production and songwriting.  There are only a few moments of droning here and there, but they soon pass and I know something incredible is on the way.  I hope the future holds more of the same for this band, may they continue to push themselves and break through even more.
B00008J4P5|4.0|The White Stripes saved a lot of money on their latest release by not falling into the trap of high production values and recording the entire album in a matter of days on aged equipment. At first glance, it may seem as if they paid off every single music critic in America with the extra cash. Honestly, Elephant is a fine piece of work but five stars from Rolling Stone is pushing it. <br />If you aren't familiar with the band, The White Stripes are a Detroit based duo comprised of Jack and Meg White(brother/sister). They scored their first mainstream hit with &quot;Fell In Love With A Girl&quot; last year. Ever since, loyal fans and critics have been waiting for a chance to officially dub them rock gods. Are they deserving of that kind of title? It depends.<br />Let me break it down for you the way I see it. Jack White is on his way to stardom and he's letting his sister come along for the ride. Elephant is at it's very best when Jack gets a chance to show off his very formidable guitar skills. The album hits bottom when Meg takes the mic. &quot;In The Dark, Dark Night&quot; is a well written song spoiled by her lack of vocal ability. Her drumming is extremely simplistic but luckily, fits well with the band's style. The only other crystal clear low point on Elephant is the closing track. &quot;It's True That We Love One Another&quot; is just plain cheesy and makes the album and its performers seem all the more odd.<br />If I had to sum up Elephant in one thought I'd say... It isn't for everyone. You're either going to love it for what it is or be let down by what it is not. But after all is said and done, a couple below average tracks don't stop The White Stripes from distinguishing themselves from the rest of the rock revival crowd that has been so popular lately. It grows on you, and one listen to &quot;Ball and Biscuit&quot; should convince anyone with a rock bone in their body that Elephant is worth the time.
B000000W5N|5.0|No offense, have never been a Stones fan. Full time musician &amp; audio engineer for 30+ years (only to establish how &quot;into&quot; music I am). <br />There are selected Stones songs I like, but Sticky Fingers is the ONE album I have by them. I liked it when it came out, appreciate it even more now. By this point they'd given up attempting to imitate Sir George Martin and, apparently without trying too hard, came up with an utterly original take on the blues-rock thing. If you're so-so on the Stones but want to have one in your collection - this is IMO the one to get.<br />again- no offense to any Stones fans intended.
B00005JLSE|5.0|Some people don't seem to undarstand that this story has a history.<br />This was first written by a journalist who was living in the time that this took place (the 20's). She wrote a book and it was made into a musical. Then there were a few movies made based on the musical, but not a one turned out too well. Director Rob Marshal thought it would be a great idea to make another movie, but this time it would be with most of the musical numbers.<br />He took on a difficult task to make this film, and make it good. The actors were hand picked for their talent and their ability. The costumes worn by the characters throughout the film were ALWAYS eye catching and were the style of the 20's with a flair of the 21st century. There weren't any doubles for the singing and dancing either. <br />The film opend with the memorable song titled &quot;All That Jazz&quot;, and went on from there. All of the musical numbers after that come from Roxie Hearts mind. This is because almost all she ever thinks about is being famous on stage, her name in all the papers.<br />Then a bargen goes wrong and she lands herself in jail with the notorious Velma Kelly. Roxie compeats with Velma for the headliners with the help of Billy Flyn, the greatest female criminal lawyer in all of Chicago.<br />Billy and Roxie stretch the truth enough to get her out and chase her dreams of being on stage. But, again, things don't work out as planned. Same goes for recently freed Velma. So, since &quot;one jazz killer isn't enough&quot; they help each other out. <BR>   <BR>So if you don't like this movie, that's fine. But just understand what you are talking about before you go making your comments. You can't trash a movie when it's based off of a musical that is based off of facts.<br />And, by the way, the song is called Cell Block Tango.
0345442970|3.0|James Luceno's prequal to Episode I, Cloak of Deception is the best of the pre classic Star Wars tales to be written.  It's exciting with interesting characters, well-written movie tie-ins and overall simply a fun read.     The interaction between Obi-wan and Qui-Gon is very well done as is the continuing introduction of Vergere.  The story revolves around a comment made in Episode I when Senator Palpatine refers to the Chancellor as being engulfed by \\"baseless accusations of corruption\\", this story tells how these accusations came to pass, as well as the simultaneous story of how Nute Gunray came to power.  Its filled with Jedi in the role of protectors, not as private investigators as seen in Rogue Planet or as diplomats as seen in The Approaching Storm.  Here they are the guardians of peace and justice for the Republic.    Luceno writes in a very different style from his New Jedi Order books, and it gives me hope for his next Star Wars work.
0066214122|1.0|Ive never submitted an Amazon review before, but if I can stop just ONE person from reading this piece of trash, save just ONE person from suffering through the clumsy prose of this wreck of a novel, then its worth speaking out. <br />I used to look forward to a new Crichton novel every couple years. But I think Crichtons novels have gotten progressively worse and more unreadable as the years have passed. And just when you think hes hit rock bottom (i.e.: Timeline, Airframe, etc), along comes Prey. Prey is so awful I cant even describe its awful awfulness to you. Im just hoping my repeated use of the word awful will convey how awful this novel truly is. After finishing Prey, I decided I would never waste money on a Crichton novel again. Quite possibly one of the worst books I have ever read. I only wish that there were a 0 star rating available.
B000003TA4|5.0|Well the only people that would be interested in a review of this are people born after 1986-1987.  So you are 16-17 getting into music and were too young to miss this in it's hayday.  I strongly reccomend this for the obvious reasons.  I recently was talking to a 16 year old who was a huge White Stripes fan and I mentioned Nevermind and he had no idea what I was talking about.  I find it interesting what people take for granted.  Did you know there is a whole generation growing up right now that hasn't experieced the staples of media we take for granted.  Unless the older generation introduces the important things to younger ones, than we could have a whole society of people who don't &quot;Im king of the world!&quot;.  Anyway this 16 year old knew of Nirvana as a band but had only just discovered music.  Needless to say I ordered him to proceed to his neerest music, do not pass go and but this album immediately!  <br />No need to get into a congratulative, adjective love fest as their are already 800 reviews about that.  The music speaks for itself and the importance is well documented to the point of nauseum.  <br />Bottom Line:  A must have.  Fantastic and important.
B00006RCOB|5.0|Directing and starring in this classic spy thriller from the eighties is Clint Eastwood, more generally known as the gruff &quot;Man With No Name&quot; in several spaghetti westerns and American westerns of his own direction.  In &quot;FireFox,&quot; Eastwood takes on a more modern and quite different role for himself, playing a former Air Force pilot who is still suffering from some rather horrific personal demons.  In the genre of spy/thriller films, Eastwood's name comes to the top in this classic that is arguably one of the best!  Although the pacing of this film is slightly off, I believe that to be intentional and it adds to the suspense that is inherent to the plot and a sure sign of skill on the director's part.<br />The premise:<br />Clint Eastwood plays former Air Force pilot Mitchell Gant who was shot down over Viet Nam and captured.  The American and British governments have learned of a new Soviet fighter plane that will ultimately tip the scales of balance to the hand of the Soviets and decide to steal the plane with the help of the Russian Jews who have been forced to design and build it.  Given Gant's heritage, a Russian mother who taught him the language and the necessity of being able to speak Russian, the American government calls him back into service.<br />What follows from there is an extraordinarily intriguing and suspenseful plot that compels the viewer through the story as we see Gant make his way into the Soviet Union and on his way to the airbase in which he must infiltrate and steal this ultimate weapon of war.  Of particular note is how well the characterizations of the Russians were played out and believable.  I've never been to Russia and I don't pretend to know how things were there during the cold war and pre-glasnost but through Eastwood's direction and the actors efforts, they quite easily bring about a &quot;suspension of disbelief&quot; in the story.<br />One minor &quot;gripe&quot; would be in the beginning of the movie when Gant is going through a flashback and they show him flying an F-4 Phantom and then an F-105 Thud and then roll back to the Phantom, two very distinct and different aircraft.  Simply because they both had the same camouflage scheme does not mean they're the same planes and directors &quot;should&quot; pay closer attention to these details.  While this was a minor distraction for myself, it in no way detracts from the films overall plot.<br />Overall, &quot;FireFox&quot; is worth every penny and I highly recommend this DVD as an honored addition to your DVD collection!  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- Soundtrack remastered in Dolby Digital 5.1 - The sound quality for this classic is perfect!<BR>- Making of Documentary:  Clint Eastwood:  Director - This is an excellent addition to the DVD with an interview from around the time of release &quot;FireFox,&quot; covering more than just this film.<BR>- Eastwood Film Highlights<BR>- Theatrical Trailer
B000025XKM|5.0|This album was a chance buy; having only heard the title track, I decided to risk it. And it's probably the best chance buy I've ever made. With only an acoustic guitar and a piano, the late Nick Drake put together one of the finest albums of his time, full to the brim with excellent songs, lead firstly by \\"Pink Moon\\", which deserves to be labeled a classic. A discerning music fan would be hard-pressed not to take a liking to Nick Drake's breezy and pensive style. Many of the sub-par musicians of our day could use a lesson or two from this album.
B00004RF8J|5.0|Frank Oz did a phenomenal job translating this off-Broadway smash to the screen in 1986.  I saw the original show in the fall of 1985 when I first moved to NYC for school.  Even if you're someone who doesn't normally like  musicals, this one is hard to resist.  The  songs are great, along with the kitschy 1950's setting.   The three  street urchins  who serve  as  a Greek chorus, and have some great songs to boot, are excellent.  But in the movie as  with the original  show,  the real  magic comes from Ellen Greene.  I'm not sure why she didn't have a bigger career, especially since  she has  such an amazingly  dynamic and powerful  singing voice (at  odds with her breathy speaking voice as Audrey).<br />I just saw the new Broadway revival and would have to say it's not worth the money.  It can't touch the  memory of this film.  The  star, Hunter Foster, is quite good.   But Kerry Butler as Audrey  does not really work at all.  Something just doesn't quite gel and she's sort of too much the girl next door for the role.  The plant effects  are sort of cool, though.
B00005JLET|5.0|This is a Miyazaki film.  That should be enough of a review by itself.  Miyazaki is simply, one of the most talented animators to ever live.  This story is an intriguing mix of fantasy, drama, and human emotion.  You should buy it, you'll be glad that you did.  I'd recommend the DVD as it is bound to last longer.  This is an ageless film that will continue to capture imaginations for years and years.

B000001E21|5.0|Very good album, unfortunitly it gets overlooked. If you like the Steve Clark era of Def Leppard you'll like this album.
B000089RVX|4.0|this is one rare album.  soft rock plus amy lee's powerful voice.  the songs feel somewhat like garbages' version 2.  edge sound, powerful voice and good lyrics.
B000001GQY|5.0|If I could I would give this CD 10 stars.  It is some of the greatest interpretations of these monumental concertos.  Yes Gilel's tempos are a bit slower in these readings than most other performers as one reviewer pointed out.  But it suits these pieces very well.  The beginning of the 2nd concerto is magestic.  His slow and grand approach to it made me hold my breath, it is as if time stands still.  In these concertos Gilels also shows his immense power and amazing musicianship.  This man could swamp any orchestra you put in front of him.  Also Jochum and the Berlin Philharmonic do a fantasic job here.  These are truly my favorite recordings of these great pieces.  And the Op. 116 Fantasies are a great bonus definently one of the best recorded of these works as well.  I recommend anyone who loves Brahms or Gilels to buy these recordings, even if you have other recordings of these pieces.
0553296981|5.0|Deeply moving.  A must read for every human.  Not only should this book be studied, it should continue to be honored for the truth it tells.  A trip to the Anne Frank Haus in Amsterdam should also be on your life's &quot;list of things to do&quot;.  Walking through the Annex brings her thoughts out of your heart and into your soul, your blood.  God bless Anne for writing her thoughts, and God bless her father for having the courage and the strength for publishing her work.
014028009X|5.0|This is my all-time favorite book. It's an honest and hilarious look at the emotional rollercoaster ride that is Bridget's life. She's a cynical optimist who can't seem to get a break or lose those last few pounds. She alternates between despair (&quot;Why? WHY?!?!&quot;) and enthusiasm (to cook a gourmet meal for friends, for example, or lose 7 pounds before tomorrow). <br />The first time I read this book, several years ago, I laughed out loud -- often -- to the point of tears. It's THAT funny.<br />If you choose to &quot;read&quot; it on audio book, you won't be disappointed. Barbara Rosenblat has the perfect voice for Bridget (and all the other characters). I've never been so impressed with a reading before.
B00008OWZC|5.0|Around 20 years ago my typical Saturday morning activity consisted of going to the local record shops and/or to the flee market of my home town. There I was looking for rare recordings of bands like the Mothers of Invention or the Velvet Underground or I was checking out the newest releases of independent bands. One other main priority for me at that time was to get a hold of Led Zeppelin live bootlegs, as I had become a fan of the band since I had heard \\"Black Dog\\" for the first time at the tender age of 15.<br />In those days the life of a Led Zeppelin addict like me was tough, as the band didn't exist anymore and the only official live recording, \\"The Song Remains The Same\\" from 1973, was rather uninspiring. After having bought every studio album, including rare cover editions and singles, the only thing left for me to do was to hunt for the various unofficial live recordings to satisfy further the addiction for my favorite band: \\"On Blueberry Hill\\" from 1970, the Osaka concert from 1971, Seattle from 1973, Earl's Court from 1975, Roskilde from 1979, etc. At the end I found myself with dozens of live albums (including 21 different versions of \\"Stairway To Heaven\\") but still with an unsatisfactory feeling, as the sound quality of most bootlegs were either poor or fair and the true quality of the music could often only be anticipated.<br />More than 20 years later and after having abandoned my vinyl collection for good long time ago, the album that I had been desperately looking for has been finally released. \\"How The West Was Won\\" features absolutely great live moments of the group, which I regard as the best rock band that has ever existed. The album consists of 18 songs recorded during two concerts on June 25th and 27th in 1972 at the LA Forum and the Long Beach Arena in California. While the material stems mostly from the first four records, three songs from the then not yet released \\"Houses Of The Holy\\" album are also included.<br />In contrast to the later concert at the Madison Square Garden from 1973, which provided the material for the album and the film with the title \\"The Song Remains The Same\\", the band was truly inspired and the sound quality of the recording is just superb. Each instrument and the voice of Robert Plant are perfectly integrated in the overall sound. One highlight of the sound aspect is the amazing powerful quality of John Bonham's drums.<br />It is very difficult for me to point out any outstanding performances of the band as there are virtually no dull moment or lapses in the musical quality throughout the 150 minutes of the CD. If I had to name my personal highlights for each musician, I would choose John Paul Jone's bass work on the \\"Immigrant Song\\", Robert Plant's vocals during the acoustic \\"Going To California\\" and \\"That's The Way\\", Jimmy Page's solo on \\"Stairway To Heaven\\" and, last but not least, John Bonham's solo on \\"Moby Dick\\" (until I heard this CD I had been sure that rock drum solos were always boring).  <br />The CD also has reminded me again why I always preferred Led Zeppelin in comparison to other bands who played in the same league. Where the Jimi Hendrix Experience consisted of one towering guitar player and two mediocre sidemen, Led Zeppelin was composed of four equally talented and equipped musicians. Where Cream was rather a loose association of three egocentric individuals, Led Zeppelin was indeed a *band*. In that respect the live versions of \\"Rock And Roll\\", \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"Black Dog\\", which are included on this album, are one of the finest moments in live rock music: Great songs presented in a raw but condensed form through an absolutely powerful wall of sound. It is still amazing to me that only four people could produce such force. <br />The only minor minus point is the packaging of the CD. The cover looks not too great, and more liner notes, information about the concert and photos would have been appreciated. But then, who really cares - the important thing is themusic.<br />This CD is absolutely mandatory for every Led Zeppelin fanatic and I also recommend it to every person who is not intimately familiar with the music of the band.<br />Hopefully this was not the last old Led Zeppelin live release by Jimmy Page.
B00001OH7G|4.0|This is my first Rory Gallagher CD and believe me it won't be the last.In fact after hearing this I have ordered the bbc sessions.One note of caution it plays great on my home system and car system -but with the ample bass featured in this CD , when I played it at work with computer speakers there was a lot of distortion .Not a fault of the CD or Rory Gallagher the speakers couldn't handle the wall of sound
0767802470|5.0|Of all of the World War II films and war films in general that I've watched, none can compare to \\"Das Boot\\" and the emotional roller coaster that this film portrays!  From the very beginning to the end of this film, I found myself to be thoroughly engrossed, captivated and empathizing with the crew of this German U-Boat and its true tale told with frightening reality by director Wolfgang Petersen.<br />Do not let the running time of approximately 209 minutes discourage you in any way when contemplating watching this film because, as stated above, this is a truly taut and suspenseful film that will keep you on the edge of your seat from beginning to end.<br />The premise:<br />Das Boot is the true story (with a mixture of minor \\"movie making\\" embellishment) of a German U-Boat and her crew during the latter stages of World War II.  It is that timing that brings such poignancy to the film and the U-Boat crews' tale, for if it were set earlier in the war it would've been an entirely different story.  Long gone for the U-Boat crews are the days when the British and Americans were stumbling around \\"trying\\" to figure how to counter the U-Boats; these are the days in which they're sending most U-Boats to the bottom long before they've had a chance to get near the merchantmen and their precious cargo of men and supplies!<br />With that premise in mind the movie sets off with a party where the crew and officers are enjoying themselves for the majority of them do not believe they will be returning and are also expressing \\"misgivings\\" over Hitler and his poor strategic and tactical planning.  We're then taken to the U-Boat and her launching on her mission to find Allied merchantmen and put them on the bottom.<br />What follows from there is a film that will actually have you cheering and praying for the crew of this U-Boat as she and her crew goes through the emotional ups and downs of war, to include the terror of being depth charged.<br />I highly recommend this film to any and all fans of films of this genre as it truly a classical masterpiece that deserved a \\"Director's Cut\\" and plays extraordinarily well with the added sixty minutes.  {ssintrepid}<br />Special Features:<br />- The film itself is a special feature as it has been digitally remastered with additional footage to include the soundtrack.<BR>- Director's Commentary<BR>- The Making of/Behind The Scenes
0385504209|5.0|An excellent book - I could hardly put it down.  It's sinful that mainstream Christianity has demonized Mary Magdalene, the wife of Jesus Christ the Messiah.  Mr. Brown reveals the truth to a broad audience.<br />Thank God for this fine book!!
B00001QEG5|5.0|There was a time when I thought I was truly alone in this dark dark world that we live in, that was until I heard the first blistering introductory chords of \\"Wake Up\\". From then on I knew that life would never be the same again.<br />Imagine the passion of Chris De Bergh mixed up with the brute force of Hulk Hogan and the lack of mercy of Pol Pot, then times it by A THOUSAND, and you have some idea of how hard this love rocks. Grrr. <br />i've never heard a record that speaks to me in my own language quite like this one. If you consider lyrics like \\"are you ready for the long train\\" and \\"tonight, tonight, tonight, tonight, (tonight), we're gonna lose control, tonight, (tonight)\\". this is something i think everyone has found themselves saying to their girlfrirnds at one time or another. Right boys!??<br />I am not afraid to say that there was a time, when clad in pink spandex I questioned my own sexuality, but after hearing \\"Hot Love\\", I knew that a man can be a man and still dress like an ugly lady. Right girls!!!!???<br />To all those \\"Sisters\\" out there, I've got one thing to say. I got one bad habit, all right? And it's just to rock and goddam roll.<br />Kerrrang!<br />(PS - the more eagle-eyed of you may notice that I have the same name as the guy that provided backing growls for the album. No relation!!!!???!!!)<br />Instruments used: Philips monitor, HP PC & keyboard, 5 cans of wife beater and several tons of pure, undiluted ROCK.
B000009PNY|4.0|I bought this jewel when it first came out, because I loved the Smashing Pumpkin's version of &quot;Never..Again.&quot; Most of the tracks are excellent with plenty of variation in the music itself. The standout track for me is Gus Gus' &quot;Monument.&quot; I don't like the tracks by Veruca Salt, Locust, Monster Magnet, and Deftones. That's why it gets a four star, because these songs are just banal to me. I don't own any Depeche Mode CDs, but for the most part these groups represented the band well. Failure kept &quot;Enjoy the Silence&quot; sounding close to the original, but different enough to call it their version. Rabbit in the Moon's &quot;Waiting for the Night&quot; switches from slow to fast several times, and is probably my second favorite track. I did have all of Hooverphonic's music, so I know that &quot;Shake the Disease&quot; is easily their best song in my opinion. Apollo 440 is very good, and they did a decent job with &quot;I Feel You.&quot; I would consider this an electronic album, and the best compilation tribute I have heard in the last five years.
B00005JLSE|4.0|I don't know why people say some people said CHICAGO was a bad movie. Heck, tons of people hated TITANIC as well.<br />The musical's three main characters- Roxie Hart (Renee Zellweger), Velma Kelly (Catherine Zeta-Jones), and Billy Flynn (Richard Gere) create a pleasingly outrageous musical set in the city of- where else, CHICAGO! It revolves around blonde sweetheart Roxie as she dreams of fame. In fact, most of the singing and dancing is in her vacuous head. She goes to jail for murder and meets famous showgirl Velma Kelly. Lawyer Billy Flynn takes her and creates a media blitz out of it. Other stuff too that was good, but this is pretty much the gist of it.<br />For SOME people, I wouldn't qualify Best Picture of the Year as the worst movie ever. CHICAGO is powerful, twisted, and... awesome. I liked the performance of Queen Latifah in &quot;When You're Good to Mama&quot; and the first few minutes of it when Zeta-Jones breaks out into &quot;All That Jazz&quot;.<br />And if you've heard, the DVD version includes &quot;Class&quot;, a song by Queen Latifah and Zeta-Jones that was cut from the movie version. BUY IT, BUY IT!
B00005176F|5.0|A customer knows a band only by released hits or videos and waits for the band to release a greatest hits album. The customer buys it and loves every track on it. That customer then sets out to buy the band's other albums, because the &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; was top-notch. That's what this album has done for me. I did have &quot;Leisure&quot; in '93, but traded that in when I got into Gangsta Rap(what a regret). My favorite track on this CD now is, &quot;This is a Low,&quot; and my least favorite track is, &quot;Charmless Man.&quot; I didn't realize how hilarious this band's lyrics were, until I listened to &quot;Coffee and T.V.,&quot; &quot;Parklife,&quot; &quot;Country House,&quot; and &quot;Charmless Man.&quot; This CD generates a jovial mood in me each time I listen to it. This album also makes me want to go out and do something. I don't skip any tracks when I play &quot;The Best of.&quot;
0440180295|4.0|Beginning a review for this book isn't an easy task.<br /><br />Most likely how it wasn't easy for Vonnegut to catalog his time in Dresden, as is evidence by this book. Yet, he still tells an intruiging story that subtly explains his view of that time.<br /><br />After a short prologue about the book (thought titled Chapter 1), we continue the story of Billy Pilgrim. Yes, continue. The events of Billy's life are not displayed in chronological order, but rather, in the order Billy experiences them in his mind, as he first falls through time and understands the events of his life from during his time in WWII, knowing his career, his relations, and even his death before he ever leaves Dresden. And even in these times, he falls through time while in these falls through time, as evidenced by his mate in the Tramalfadorian zoo.<br /><br />It's a fragmented story, trying to portray a man's fragmented life, while the undertones regard fate, massacre, and meaningless effort. And some of the story may not be real, or perhaps all of it is imagined while Billy daydreams in Nazi Germany, arousing problems with those around him. Things such as his abduction by the Tramalfadorians and being put in a zoo seem ridiculous, as well as his relation to Kilgore Trout and his reactions toward people.<br /><br />In short: Billy's mind is also fragmented. He can't think straight, he daydreams, and seems too stupid or awestruck by everything to understand what goes on around him. It's amazing a man this disoriented became a doctor; and maybe downright impossible if he really is imagining all his travels and experiences in different points in life.<br /><br />\\"Slaughterhouse Five\\" is a very strange novel, but it will have a profound effect on its reader, as one realizes near the end the impact of the words engraved on his mate's necklace towards the rest of the story. It's about fate, whether Billy imagined it or not, and while it's an odd tale, it's Vonnegut, and there's a valuable message,whether you agree with it or not.
B00008WT5J|1.0|If you´re an AC/DC fan, there´s absolutely no need to spend 19 dollars in this album.<br />It has nine songs, only three of them original (&quot;Who Made Who&quot;, and two instrumentals, &quot;DT&quot; and &quot;Chase The Ace&quot;). So, it´s not a proper compilation, it´s just a bunch of songs put together in a hurry to cash over the quality of the tittle track.
B0000AXE8I|1.0|I'm really fond on the original Matrix movie and now I seriously doubt if I'll take the chance to waste another 2 hours watching Matrix Revolutions.<BR>First thing with Matrix Reloaded is the utter lack of script or plot. Producers and director tried to fill in this void by exposing the audience to never-ending shots of overwhelming special FX. The result is a dull movie that has no traces of the creativity displayed on the original Matrix where plot and visual FX were wisely combined. This time characters are flat and unbelieveble so we don't care for what happens to them. <BR>Let's hope that Matrix Revolutions will leave a better taste in our mouths.<BR>Don't waste your money in this DVD, buy a \\"real movie\\" instead for this is nothing but a 2-hour long trailer for the videogame (which by the way I'm sure will be much more interesting)
B00006IK1C|4.0|Dickinson started his solo career while stilla member of Iron Maiden. He neede to get his great creativity out of his chest, creativity trapped inside Maiden´s formulatic approach to songwriting. So, he departed from sheer heavy metal and went into hard rock.<br />He recruited Janick Gers (who would join Maiden later, unfortunately for them) and Fabio Del Rio and Andy Carr, hired the services of famed producer Chris Tsangarides and went with all the courage for this solid album.<br />All in all, a very strong debut.
B00005JLWN|5.0|This is an awesome movie. It has a wonderful combination of action and drama. Though the gun kata may look silly, it still is similar to the concept of martial art, which is the mimicry and study of animals and physics. It simply uses a firearm, and still looks cool. The whole concept really reminds me of the novel &quot;1984,&quot; which by itself makes this a wonderful movie.
B00004RFCM|5.0|I have all the DVD's that are out.  I think they are great for adults....the four women actually say and do things I think about saying and doing!!!!  I like the videos much better than the book....I read it in three hours but kept expecting it to get better....so unlike the fast paced shows.  They talk about topics we single women think about all the time.....I think I will re-watch them for years to come.  A good investment.
B00009M6VJ|4.0|This movie was well worth watching.  Many movies out these days leave me feeling like I wasted my time. The Life of David Gale may be controversial, but depicts a very unfortunate, but realistic view of human passions. There were a few cases throughout the film when the situations were questionably believable, but the overall premise of the movie provoked complex thought and emotions. This movie was fraught with symbolism, and an array of metaphores that contributed to the complexity of the movie. It seems that many previous reviewers possibly may have taken this movie for &quot;face value&quot; only and were resistant to analyzing the depths of this film. I gladly will recommend this movie and will watch it again.
B000002J27|5.0|this is one of the best genesis albums if you do not have it you are missing a lot .
B000099T2L|2.0|Having been a Destiny's Child fan and a huge fan of group's Kelly Rowland's solo album &quot;Simply Deep&quot;, I was highly anticipating the unleashing of this album by Beyonce.  I had first heard the upbeat, infectious, contagious, crazy first single &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; one early morning on VH1.  I bought this album right away after its release and found myself incredibly disappointed.<br />Not one song on this album measures up to the first track, &quot;Crazy In Love.&quot;  This is probably the most overrated album of the year.  The ballads shouldn't be accepting those silly little beats to &quot;keep them more interesting&quot; as one reviewer said.  They were boring anyways because all Beyonce is doing is singing in a low voice throughout the whole track, with absolutely no hooks or any memorable choruses.  <br />I would have given this album 1 star had it not been for &quot;Baby Boy&quot; and &quot;That's How You Like It.&quot;  Nothing completely disastrous but certainly nothing special at all.  Does not measure up to Kelly Rowland's &quot;Simply Deep&quot; which is much better. I recommend that instead.  I'm glad Beyonce will be getting back with Destiny's Child in 2004 because her solo disc is nothing to get yourself worked over.<br />I believe that Beyonce has the potiental to make a better album than this, but this one doesn't show it.  Save your money, people.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Was this movie as good as the first...no. The Matrix is a movie that only comes along every 10 to 15 yrs, and blows us out of the water. If they would have tried to repeat what they did in the first, Reloaded would have been forced and alot worse. What the brothers did was take what they'd given us from the first Matrix and had fun with it. I mean, come on, a fight seen with 100 against 1. Sounds stupid on paper, but they pulled it off pretty good I think. If there had never been a first Matrix movie, this movie would still have done good by itself. I'd like to see any of these people writing bad reviews about Reloaded come up with what the brothers have given us. Say what you will but the Matrix trilogy will go down as one of the best in movie history. When my 70 yrs old grandma and grandpa have heard of the matrix, you know the word is out!
B000002L9J|5.0|With songs ranging from epic to pop, and lyrics ranging from the poetic to the silly, the sardonic to the pathetic, this truly is one of the great albums.  With the possible exception of the indulgent 'Never Had No One Ever', every song is a gem.<br />Obvious pinnacles are 'I Know It's Over', 'The Boy With a Thorn in His Side,' and 'There is a Light That Never Goes Out', collectively some of the most beautiful music ever crafted.  But the heavier 'The Queen is Dead' and 'Bigmouth Strikes Again,' serve as refreshing antitheses, while the acute 'Frankly Mr. Shankly' and 'Some Girls are Bigger than Others' fit in wonderfully.<br />Highest Recommendations.
B000002Q88|5.0|Let me begin by stating that a true follower of any band will adjust to the changes that a band incurs musically and lyrically.<BR>If any band has ever been challenged by this, it has been Kansas.<BR>I've read many reviews of this album and the balance of positive with the negative only strengthens my opinion of this wonderful album. After their previous effort 'Power', I anxiously awaited their next album to see which direction it would take, and I was astonished at the results. Steve Walsh's voice speaks more personally and emotionally on this recording, especially in<BR>'Ghosts', 'Inside of Me', and 'I Counted on Love', by far the songs I felt closest to at a first listen. Steve Morse also continues to add an energy to this album that very few guitarists could develop into: listen to 'Rainmaker' and you will understand. Although I prefer 'Power' over this album, I still feel an attachment to this recording I have a difficult time explaining; it can be very joyful at one moment and then mysterious and sorrowful at the next. These musicians were meant to be together and hopefully they will continue to fill the void inside of all of us that cries out to be heard.
B000002LCX|3.0|After a masterful 'The Queen is Dead,' the Smiths had little room to maneuver.  They had already perfected both the jaunty romping short tune as well as a more refined epic sensibility.  As a result, their final album, 'Strangeways, Here We Come' is a melange of over-indulgence and self-imitation, with a few characteristic sparks of brilliance.<br />The album's opening track 'A Rush and a Push...' is a romping tune, in the musical style of 'Rusholme Ruffians' but without the wit.  Not really bad, but a pretty tepid opener.<br />The next track, 'I Started Something I Couldn't Finish' is pretty unique in the Smith's repetoire, and actually quite good.  It's a shame the album couldn't have been taken in this direction - with harder guitars by Marr in contrast to TQID.<br />'Death of a Disco Dancer' is one of the more disappointing tracks on the album.  The Smiths have already done material like this, and much better.  'Death of a Disco Dancer' sounds like a poorly written imitation of the wonderful 'I Know It's Over'.  The most noticeable difference in presentation is a change in Morrissey's voice, from its darker form of TQID to a more pathetic shrill.  Frankly Mr. Shankly, 'Girlfriend in a Coma' also seems like an insipid imitation of their superior earlier material.  <br />'Stop Me If You Think...' is another good song.  Solidly guitar-driven, Morrissey abandons the constant attempts at pathos for some wonderful song-writing.  If only the whole album could have been like this.<br />'Last Night I Dreamt That Somebody Loved Me' is the Smiths' last epic.  While straddling the line of self-indulgence, it is a decent song.  The biggest difference from earlier material on this album is that Morrissey has found his voice again.  The quality songs continue with 'Unhappy Birthday'.  One of the highlights of the album - if not spectacular, it is certainly memorable.<br />Unfortunately, just when the album seems to be redeeming itself, 'Paint a Vulgar Picture' proves an unnecessary, droning and vapid song.  'Death at One's Elbow', while a relief from the frequent over-indulgence, offers little to satiate.<br />Fortunately, the Smiths have enough in them for a grand, but subtle finale.  'I Won't Share You' truly is one of their finest songs.  A fitting swan song.<br />All said, it's a pretty inconsistent effort - certainly their worst album, but a must listen for the Smiths fan.  I find it difficult to understand how anyone could consider this the Smiths' greatest.  For all those just discovering the band, start with their masterpiece 'The Queen is Dead,' and check out their edgier earlier material exemplified by 'Hatful of Hollow'.  No one should be scared off from a band this great by the over-indulgences so frequent on 'Strangeways, Here We Come.'
B00003CXA2|5.0|I love Tom Hanks, and have seen him in all his films.  This is one of, if not THE, best.  In this role, he disappears as Tom Hanks and becomes Forrest Gump.  And when a great actor does that--watch out!!  In some of Hanks' movies, he overshadows the movie and you are aware of Tom Hanks playing a role. (I think this happened with some of Meryl Streeps movies.)But not in this one.  He is pure Forrest. <br />The supporting roles are very engaging also and are well-acted:  I loved Sally Fields' mother--Sally never misses the right ambience, tone of voice, etc.  She nails the mother.  And Bubba, I will never forget the scenes during which he is listing every shrimp recipe in the world--especially the one where they are cleaning the floor with toothbrushes.  Jenny is also spot on.  She got each decade just right.  And Gary Sinise screaming his lungs out at God during the hurricane--great scene.  <br />I rank this as one of the top ten movies ever made.
B0000BWVCM|5.0|it was a wicked film my fav. character is nightcrawler
B00008EY9G|4.0|Definitely a good flick but I'm not sure you need to buy it.  A rental would suffice.  One word to the wise; DO NOT buy this for the &quot;alternate ending.&quot;  It doesn't exist for all intents and purposes.  They add just a few flashes of the main character in a flashback/dream sequence at the end.  That's it!  BIG DEAL!  The advertising on the package touting a widescreen presentation with an extended version is bogus.
B00008OWZC|5.0|best live recording ever, theyve really done a good job of redeeming led zeppelin's catalog. john bonham is the best drummer in history, jimmy page's guitar stands out, led zeppelin is the best rock and roll band, simply put.
B00002R0MC|5.0|Although Bob Marley had a tough life and also ups and downs, he still managed to write and perform the most inspiring music of all time, His power through music helped change many ways in many countries.<BR>In his last few years, when he was battling cancer, he wrote even more and far better than he had ever done, and he still performed. Its this sort of compassion that music lacks today, and that's why Bob Marley will always be number 1.

0385504209|1.0|Reading Dan Brown's \\"The DaVinci Code\\" brought me instantly back to the way I felt when I first tried John Grisham: this is the perfect author for someone who either has difficulty reading or doesn't really enjoy it. Strictly eighth grade level, at the most. No one you will ever meet in real life talks or acts remotely like Brown's banal characters in their contrived predicaments.<br />The \\"DaVinci\\" plot could have been actually fascinating, but Brown's shallow, cliche characterizations and simplistic writing style are insulting. Any \\"Harry Potter\\" book is more intelligent and engrossing, not in any way meant as disrespect for J.K. Rowling by lumping her fine work in with this clap-trap.
B00004TDTO|5.0|Even after 25 years, after an endless succession of sequels, parodies, and intertextual references, it is easy to see why this became the highest grossing movie in history, and it remains the best horror movie ever made.  And it's not because of the shark -- though the shark is big and scary, providing much more heart-pounding suspense than some guy in a hockey mask slicing up campers.  <br />It's because of the trio of precisely realized heroes drawn from Moby Dick -- Martin Brody, the by-the-book Ishmael with a troubled past, who hates water but lives on an island; Matt Hooper, the effervescent shark-chasing Queequeg, who offers Brody a chance for salvation; and Quint the sea-chanty singing Captain Ahab. Their bonding is intense and exhilerating, and at the end of the movie one feels that Brody has finally been redeemed, and Hooper has finally found a home. There are dozens of wonderfully-drawn minor characters, like the stammering mayor or the dumpy housewife whose son is eaten by the shark, and Amityville is a character in its own right, beautifully photographed and absolutely real -- its nice to see a beach for once populated by actual people, not gym-toned eye candy.   <br />The movie ages well, with only a bit of slang and some ludicrous leisure suits to place it in the 1970's.  The DVD could use more extras: there are hundreds of rather dull production photos, a few shark facts, and a short documentary, but the best horror movie ever made needs a full scene-by-scene commentary.
B00005JKZV|1.0|After Fellowship of the Ring, I expected much more from The Two Towers than I received!  It was such a digression from the reality of the book that it could be considered an entirely different novel  that was filmed.<br />Major spoilers follow!<br />Eomer (and the Riders of Rohan with him) was not banished and did not ride to the north;<br />The King of Rohan did not 'retreat' to Helms Deep with his people;<br />Gandalf did not have to ride of to get Eomer;<br />The Elves did not help defend Helm's Deep;<br />The Ents did not say no to going to war;<br />Where were the Huorns;<br />Faramir was not the smarmy betrayer as shown - he was much more honorable;<br />The Tolkien family should NEVER have allowed such a dishonorable piece of trash to be shown!
B0000A1RJI|5.0|This has to be the best original score to any movie I have seen. The songs are so catchy and have such a great feel to them.  Although they somewhat play the main chorus a little too much, it varies from song to song and the chorus has different varieties. If you need a song to get you in the mood to go to work on Monday mornings(or any morning, for that matter), this is the CD for you!
B0000A02TZ|5.0|This excellent movie is so real to life (in an exaggerated way) that you can see someone you recognize (even if the face is different).  Even if you never went to college, you will see your friends from high school portrayed in this film.<br />You need to get this movie, if only to refresh your memories of school!
B000002LMM|3.0|Twin Peaks was my favorite [[ASIN:B000UX6THK TV show]] back when it was on.  So naturally, I bought the soundtrack.  To be honest, it was a little disappointing to me.  The Angelo Badalamenti instrumentals are moody, but they aren't that interesting to listen to outside the context of the show, at least to me.  However, I love the three songs by Julee Cruise that are included.  Actually, I would rather listen to Julee Cruise's album [[ASIN:B000002LH4 Floating Into the Night]], which includes the three songs here plus many others, than listen to this soundtrack.  People who enjoy listening to instrumentals from soundtracks will probably enjoy this album more than I do.
B00002ZMNV|4.0|I bought this as a gift for hubby...I am not a Metallica fan. I  have to admit I LOVED IT! It is just nothing like you have ever heard!
B00005JKG5|5.0|Of the top five or so movies that have had the greatest impression on me, no movie had the personal impact as did &quot;Flashdance.&quot; I was going through, what I like to call, a &quot;character building&quot; period in my life after having moved to California a little less than a year before this movie came out. Long story short: no job, no car, no money when a friend of mine called and said he wanted me to go see &quot;Flashdance,&quot; with him- his treat. After a little coercing, I gave in. <br />Yes, the movie has a typical or predictable plot, but I would not call it weak because of the actors and the memorable characters they created. The viewer is bonded to the characters in this movie- one cares what happens to them. The cinematography in this movie is great, especially the opening credit scenes of Pittsburgh as Alex is riding her bike to work. No, this movie doesn't have &quot;5-star&quot; acting... I think that would have ruined this whole movie. It has, what I would call, &quot;real-life&quot; acting: not that polished and maybe stumbles a bit here and there. It gives this movie its strength, not a weakness.<br />Not only are the musical scenes great, the background musical interludes chosen also help set the feeling in many of the scenes... &quot;Lady, Lady, Lady,&quot; sung by Joe Esposito playing during a tender romantic scene between Alex and her boss, and- my favorite- &quot;I'll Be Here Where The Heart Is,&quot; sung by Kim Carnes played during one of Alex's low-points in the film.<br />The highlight of the film is its finale when Alex is auditioning in front of the Pittsburgh Dance and Conservatory Company's selection committee. I would call it one of the greatest movie moments of all time. I stepped out of the theatre feeling I was walking three feet above the ground back to the car. I have never left another movie sensing that level of enthusiasm, exhilaration, and energy. I made myself a promise at that moment that things would get better...and they did too... in ways I never could have imagined at the time. Thank you, Jennifer Beals, for the motivation and inspiration you gave me at that time in my life!<br />This was one of the most influential movies of the '80's. The DVD picture is clearer and the sound incredible compared to my ol' VHS tape. GREAT movie! If you haven't seen it, buy it and see what positive effect it has on you!
0385512104|5.0|This stunning debut novel is the best book I've read this year. You know you are in for something different when you open the book to the first chapter, but it is numbered &quot;2.&quot; And the next chapter is 3, then 5, then 7, and so on until it is explained that Christopher, our 15-year-old protagonist, is autistic. As some differently-abled children are, he is a savant, in his particular case with prime numbers and the ability to name every country and its capital, and he has an extremely logical mind, but he also has other issues like he can't stand to be touched, won't eat brown or yellow food, and finds comfort in curling up in a corner and groaning. When he finds his neighbor's dog has been killed, he decides to solve the mystery  la his favorite sleuth, Sherlock Holmes, and that is ostensibly what the book is about.  But the reality is a beautifully written book with amazing characters and a great storyline - everything a book is supposed to have but seldom does. A truly remarkable book.
B00005JM6E|5.0|While I really enjoyed the new version of the Four Feathers, I think that this is by far superior.  The cast and settings are really great.  Especially the supporting cast.  Just a great classic film.  Anyone who enjoys adventure movies and the great movies of the '30's and '40's will enjoy this movie.  This is a Must Have video that rates right up there with classic Bogart films.

B0000AUHPG|4.0|Anyone who enjoys westerns, especially the early Clint Eastwood movies will want this movie in their collection.  This is is the best of genre.  Jack Elam's cameo performance in the opening is a real must see.  The cast is great with Jason Robards and Charles Bronson turning in some of thier finest work.  Henry Fonda is excellent as the heavy.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Do sequels stink? Ah, that eternal question. And the only right answer is: yes, but there are exceptions to the rule. <br />Now, is the overhyped Matrix Reloaded worth the criticism and/or praise? There's not an easy answer, since it's in fact only half of the movie and depending on the Matrix Revolutions to lift it up there with the Back To The Future II or sink it to Speed II (which is why Speed III wasn't made).<br />Let's examine the evidence bit by bit and make a conclusion of the whole...<br />Story - good, although it could be a lot better. And those 15-20 minutes after the initial action, including the sex-scene and Zion dancers should've been cut. Thanks to the DVD chapter system, that will be avoidable now!<br />Characters - some small development here and there (Neo as Jesus, Morpheus' beliefs a minority), but nothing worth writing home about. Some new characters (Niobe, Architect) clearly haven't played their whole role yet. And if Merovingian doesn't appear in the Revolutions with a significant role to play, I will feel cheated - not because he's a wonderful character (he is not) - but because it'll be clear he was put there to \\"look cool and speak some french\\" and not serve any higher narrative purpose. Also, it'll be a shame not to see a little more of Monica Belluci...<br />Action - the best directed and choreographed action you've ever seen. Outdoes the original Matrix, which is a tall order by itself. Finale on the freeway is unbelievable!<br />Dialogue - Machines are keeping us alive, while blah, blah, blah... Cause and effect... blah, blah, blah... Pretty boring when you hear it twice, but it's the same for the original. The exception is \\"classic\\" dialogue between Neo and the Oracle, as well as the final dialogue between Neo and the Architect, which are the only dialogues worth watching - especially the Architect's one, since it redefines the whole movie including the original Matrix. You have to watch it very closely and a few times to really get it.<br />Humour - in very small doses, the same as in the original. Trinity's \\"excuse me\\" line in the toillette is the only really funny moment. <br />Music - standard techno, nu metal combination with a few atmosferical numbers. The original Matrix soundtrack is better, but this one serves purpose as well.<br />Direction - pretty pedestrian, except for the action sequences. That 15-20 minutes really kills the momentum after the initial action and also deprives the movie of five-star rating. \\"Bullet-time\\" and \\"frozen graphic moments\\" are still powerful tools, especially during the freeway chase...<br />Effects - see action and direction!<br />Sound - great! Can't wait to see it on DVD in 5.1 surround!<br />Coolness - anything happening inside the Matrix is very cool indeed, while everything happening in Zion is not cool at all. Of course, it's the sunglasses that do it, not the acting or anything else. <br />CONCLUSION OF A MOVIE AS A WHOLE:<br />Well, I couldn't put it any better than the \\"Empire UK\\" reviewers put it: \\"A five star experience, but not a five star movie.\\" It is better than most sequels, and it achieves that with being only a first half of the movie. That's impressive!<br />But, should you buy this DVD? Of course! Because of the chapter system on your DVD, Matrix Reloaded will be even better to watch at home!!!
0553274503|2.0|Flowers for Algernon provided entertainment in the biggining explaining his operation and sad stories, but I found that it was all downhill from there.  I feel the book goes too in depth about Charlie's feelings on relationships.  Not one of my favorites.

B00005RHGK|5.0|Everything about this movie was right on. I don't watch horror<br />to see blood and guts, I get the most chills when I just can't<br />see or even predict what will happen next. I watched this with<br />the lights out and the sound loud and ejoyed the B movie style(which means don't take it so seriously, expect some stupid, dumb things to happen and things that don't make sense always but you can laugh with and the same time get good and spooked) It really doesn't take it self so<br />seriously but at the same time they made this strange and draws you in just by the unusal demon like character and his needs! I liked<br />the tension they created right away and the surreal predicaments<br />the brother, sisters, police and others find themselves in. This is an above average scare treat and flies by.
B00009V7P8|5.0|I just bought this cd today.  Before i listened to it, about 8 hours ago, i had never heard of Damien Rice O.  I chose it randomly, and LOVE it.  The lyrics, the music...the vocals- every aspect of this cd is amazing.  Each song draws me in.  I feel as though i connect w/ each song.  I recommend this cd to anyone who has an appreciation for REAL music-music that speaks about true feelings....real life.
B00000IPAX|2.0|I bought this album one year after it's original release, i didn't liked it (except for Adams song, which is on my opinion a graet song ), if you liked previous blink stuff you'll like this, is basiclly the same sound and the same vibe. But we can not expect a lot from a band of guys that are extremly inmature, and always repeating the same thing, still i think it's blink's best album (the rest are really bad, they are always trying to sound like higher level bands like green day) if you  are a blink fan, and haven't got it yet, get it , you'll have a good time listening to it
B00008EY9G|5.0|I'll just keep my review short and sweet...this movie is excellent...best i've seen in a very long time...and finaly...a movie with an ending that doesn't stink...great plot twists...highly recomended!!!

B00005N5S5|5.0|Out of all the three terminator movies, this is the best one. Sure the special effects aren't as good as the other two because it is older, but who cares? The action is CRAZY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Arnold Schwarzenneger, who plays the Terminator, is sent back in time to destroy Sarah Connor. A military man, who has been hunting Terminator for a while, must save and protect Sarah and kill Terminator before it's too late. This special edition DVD has documentaries, trailers, deleted scenes, and more. If you like Terminator 2 and Terminator 3, you'll love this one even more. Get ready for eye-popping, jaw-breaking action when you watch this movie.

B000099T2L|2.0|I have to say that this was the biggest disapointment in music to me. Michelles album was really good for being a gospel album...Then when I heard Kelly's how great that was I just assumed since i love Destiny's child and Beyonce wrote the songs her album would be the best. I was wrong. There are 3 up beat songs on the album and only two are good, I love ballads the most but hers are just boring and all sound the same. Then to make it all worst she makes it all the cheesier with the song to her father, this is why people make fun of pop. Im glad she loves her daddy buit the song sounds kinda incestuious to me.<br />the best song is the destiny child song DANGEROUSLY INLOVE, then her two singles are really good...a few others are decent but the majority put me to sleep never since i bought Geri Haliwell's cd have I hated a cd so much. I iwll say its better than Justin Timberlakes and her voice is great...Most of the lyrics are beautiful thats why it got 2 stars but as far as beats its just not it for me.<br />1.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|If the incredible run of Fleetwood Mac ends with this release (and I can't imagine this being so...) then they've further solidified their standing as one of rocks' icons and can be secure in the knowledge that they've gone out in style. This is an incrediblebly diverse collection that only gets better when listened to over and over again and is probably what the combination of Lindsey Buckingham and Stevie Nicks would have sounded like had they not ever joined Fleetwood Mac in 1976.<br />\\"Say You Will\\" features the almost fully organized \\"Rumours\\" version of Fleetwood Mac (minus Christine McVie) in the studio for the first time since 1987's \\"Tango in the Night\\" (1997's \\"The Dance\\" being a pleasent \\"homecoming\\") and they've really never sounded better (Mick Fleetwood and John McVie, as always, contribute little to the songwriting effort but are again vindicated as one of the best rhythym sections around). This work is made up of a combination of tunes from a prospective solo follow-up to 1992's \\"Out of the Cradle\\" by Lindsey Buckingham and new music from Stevie Nicks. The story of how this latest version of the group was reunited adds another mystical chapter to the group's already sizeable mystique. Buckingham in the studio recruiting musicians meets Fleetwood and asks him to play drums on his \\"new album\\". They collectively decide that the new songs are missing something and that something comes in the name of John McVie who agrees to play bass and the legendary magic is rekindled.<br />Stevie Nicks (on the road promoting her \\"Shangri-La\\" album) is then asked to join the group...one thing leads to another and they decide to record a new album. All members have matured beyond the halycon days of \\"Rumours\\" (Lindsey Buckingham is now married with two children!!)  and this new maturity is very definitely evident in the new music.<br />Of the 18 new songs, I feel passionate about 13 of them with varying degrees of emotion. All of the songs penned by Lindsey Buckingham are fantastic...he again amazes me with such a divergent musical direction from his previous releases. \\"Bleed to Love Her\\" is the highlight of the album followed closely by \\"Steal Your Heart Away\\". Had he not contributed these to the new \\"Mac\\" album, they would have undoubtedly ended up on the much awaited solo release.<br />Stevie Nicks also shows new motivation by contributing the title song, \\"Thrown Down\\", \\"Destiny Rules\\" and the album/concert closing \\"Goodbye Baby\\" (an incredibly tender and emotional song bringing back memories from Tusk's \\"Beautiful Child\\"). Production and song organization is essentially the \\"Buckingham\\" show and drives me to conclude that had he and Nicks stayed together (following their 1975 \\"BuckinghamNicks\\" combination), this is what they would have sounded like.<br />Catchy modern pop along with the requisite Mac emotional staples, Fleetwood Mac shows that unlike many of the 70's/ 80's supergroups (the Eagles being a prime example), they still have a major contribution to make to modern music and deserve their reputation as one of popular music's best performers. I very heartily recommend this album!!!
B00005JM02|5.0|Pixar animation studios may be one of the most well known movie companies around. And for good reason. Pixar has produced some of the best childrens movies ever seen; such as Toy Story, and Monsters Inc. These movies have also happened to be some of the first in a three dimentianal format. But \\"Finding Nemo\\" was certainly not \\"just\\" a children's flick. This movie was one of the best movies I've ever seen; animated or not. The movie's core revolves around Marlin, an over protective father clownfish (Albert Brooks) who is constantly afraid of the big sea. His son on the other hand, Nemo (Alexander Gould), is enthusiastic and wanting to learn all about the world around him. The already small family is split apart when divers trap Nemo in a net for transport to a fish tank. The rest of the movie chronicles Marlin's journey to resque his young son. Along the way, Marlin meats Dori, a funny and constantly forgetful fish (Ellen Degenoris). Togeather, they search the ocean blue for signs of where the divers went. The movie combines great casting, wounderful scripting, witty jokes (some of which will go over the kid's heads), wounerous enviorments, and a whole lot of heart. When people ask me if Finding Nemo is a cute movie, I tell them it's more than cute, it's astounding. Jamie Diamond - Kidmedia International
B000068PQ0|5.0|Its hard to explain how good this album is. Its my first Lips album, yet, its got me so hooked. I see why this album got so much praise. People: it really is that good. Let me explain..<br />The album starts off with &quot;Fight Test&quot;, and is one of my favorites. Beautiful lyrics, and the guitars, while not very prominant, are placed in the best places and really bring the track a spiritual beauty. You can really feel emotion in this. Although, its hard to say what to feel. <br />&quot;One More Robot&quot; is a trippy song. It revolves around the opening bass line, and gives you the feeling that a narrative will be present throughout the album. Great track. <br />&quot;Yoshimi Battles the Pink Robots part 1&quot;. This track is what got me hooked on this band. Its definately not as brilliant as some of the songs on this album, as far as structure goes, but its has a simplistic beauty about it. The lyrics, while childish are, well, just good. <br />&quot;Yoshimi...part 2&quot; is an insturmental and builds off the prowess and trippiness of part 1. The main theme circles around time and time, and in the background you can here the heroine fighting the robots.. A good track. But the drums here seem a little outta place. Regardless: GREAT.<br />&quot;..Magicians&quot; is really unique, and brilliant. It is very psychodelic but calms down and gives the listener a comforting feeling. Before spiralling back onto its acid-driven ego trip. Which brings us to the next song..<br />&quot;Ego trippin at the gates of hell.&quot; I think this is the highlight of the album. First. The lyrics are simple, but the chorus (&quot;must have been trippin, Just ego trippin&quot;) is just amazing. It shows how good the Lips. I have nothing to say about this other than I would buy the album for this song alone.<br />&quot;Are you A Hypnotist&quot; is, in my opinion very mediocre. And &quot;Its summertime&quot; is the biggest letdown. This song couldve been so much more, I think. Its just missing something that all the other tracks on the album have. Its the only track I feel that is &quot;skippable&quot;.<br />Track 9 &quot;Do You Realize?&quot; was used in several techie commercials and was sort of promotional. I disagree with the reviewer who said the change in tempo/mood was a bad idea. Its a beautifully crafted song, and its background synths give you the idea of an old 70s western. The lyrics are simple and straightforward, like most on the album, but are some of my favorite off of the album.<BR>&quot;You realize, that the sun doesn't go down...Its just an illusion, created by the earth going 'round.&quot;<br />&quot;All we Have is Now&quot; is a track that is very lamenting and gives you the feeling that the narrator is telling you of a downfall of somesort. Maybe I'm imagining this, but anyway you think about it, you'd be crazy not to think its not one of the best, if not the best off the album.<br />Track 11 &quot;...Ballons&quot; is another instrumental, and gives you a sort of closure to the album. While its not a bad track, I wouldn't mind having &quot;All We Have is Now&quot; as the final track. <br />If you do not own this album, chances are you're looking for a reason to buy it. There are infinite reasons. Many I named, and some that cant be known without a listen. Or many listens. Because the album actually improves upon multiple listenings. <br />After listening you will REALIZE how great this band is. And you maybe even become a better critic. Or a better human.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I read the trilogy when I was a teenager (a long time ago) and absolutely HATED the first movie.  waited for DVD, and with low expectations rented &quot;Two Towers.&quot;  I was agreeably surprised.  The characters have a little more character, the battle scenes are at least VISIBLE (unlike &quot;Fellowship&quot; where half the time battles were black screen with grey shadows, impossible to know what was going on).  They did a pretty good job of creating something that looked large scale.<br />That said, there were two things that still really set my teeth on edge: (1) the color affectation.  Don't understand why moviemakers think it is cool to do really weird things to the color.  I realize that the theme of the movie is &quot;dark&quot;, but the color is so bleached that they may as well have filmed it in black and white.  And the other elements of the film should create enough atmosphere that we should not need the perpetual twilight to understand that the world is &quot;dark.&quot; WE GET IT, OK?? Over  the time covered by the movie, the sun should have come out once or twice.  Even the &quot;lightest&quot; scenes, in Rohan, looked like northern scotland on a rainy day.<br />(2) CHOIR OF ANGELS: how impossibly hokey, all that &quot;AH - Ah!&quot; ing by what sounds like a choir of angels lost from &quot;The Ten Commandments&quot;.  It is so annoying I felt like turning the movie off every time. Stick with the pseudo - Celtic motif, or other less intrusive &quot;this is a holy moment&quot; music; these angels are really awful.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I wasn't going to buy or rent TTT until the extended version in November.  When I saw the film in the theater, I wasn't as impressed as I had been with Fellowship.  I was wowed, true, but something seemed to be missing.  Well, I'm glad I broke down and bought the DVD.  I couldn't help myself.  After watching TTT a second, and then a third time, I really grew to appreciate the scenry, special effects and costuming... in short, the art.  Really, I should write: ART!  From the acting, the digital effects, model work, make-up, score, costuming, and sound effects, this movie truly did make history... no matter what the critics or Tolkien purist snobs might think.  This was a movie above any other movie, in my humble opinion.<br />I still think there was something missing, though.  However, after watching the preview for the extended version, I realized that PJ had to remove a lot of material, and that missing material (I'm pretty sure) will fill in that gap.  What was missing was some important character development, especially Faramir.  I too thought on first inspection that PJ handled Faramir a bit unfairly, but I'm sure this was only because of the editing process.<br />As far as the \\"purists\\" go... I've read the LotRs once every year every since seventh grade (which makes for about 22 times, but who's counting?), the Silm more than a dozen, BoLT twice, UT three times, and HoME once (if you don't know what those acronyms mean that's alright; that just means you aren't a hopeless geek).  You \\"purists\\" shouldn't have been expecting the books.  Really, what movie based on a book follows the book to the letter?  How can a movie do that?  While PJ's interpretation isn't exactly according to how I imagined Middle Earth, and while he may have added a few surprises of his own, his vision of Middle Earth and these characters (even Faramir) were fair to Tolkien's spirit, and that's the best for which one can hope.  A movie only fails the original work of literature if it does violence to that work of literature.  PJ certianly did not.  I hope that by these films there will be an even wider and more diverse audience of Tolkien fans--new Tolkien fans that won't throw around the word \\"purist\\" like so many Middle Earth Nazis.

B00005YW4H|5.0|I enjoyed hearing this music on the Grammys and actually bought the CD because of that and because I like to &quot;keep current&quot; with the interests of my children and grandchildren, as well as any other younger people I may meet.  I am so glad I did buy it, because it is so refreshingly beautiful and lyrical that I never tire of it.

This is a deeply personal album with insightful lyrics and sharp beats.  Lopez really pours out her soul and gives her ALL with such amazing candor.  Midway into the record, I had to stop the CD because I was in such a state of awe.  Buy this record, and you will never want to listen to another Joni Mitchell record ever again.
B00008EY9G|5.0|FASCINATING MOVIE, MAKES YOU THINK:<br />This is one of those movies that you find fascinating.  At first it all starts to work in together.  Then, for a while, you are not quite sure what is going on.  However,by the ending it all fits back together again.<br />BEGINS WITH A PSYCHIATRIST REVIEWING A FILE, THEN THE MOTEL SCENE:<br />The movie starts with a psychiatrist reading over a file that discusses, various horrible crimes.  This psychiatrist is treating an inmate who is scheduled to die for crimes he committed.  This inmate, the psychiatrist thinks is not sane enough to be be aware of these crimes and he feels execution is not the answer, but treatment in a mental institution is more suitable.  It is with this premise, you see him continue to a legal hearing on this matter, before you jump to the situation in the motel.<br />BASIC PREMISE:<br />John Cusack stars in this part of the movie that puts several strangers in a motel due to a variety of circumstances.  Most end up there, due to the weather.  Ray Liotta, also plays a pivotal role in this old time horror movie.  I call this an old time horror movie because except for the blood, the gore is kept to a minium.  Also it has the tension and surprises, you would expect from a well crafted horror flick.  All of this is packaged in an interesting twist that you are somewhat warned of.  I really like the way it was done.<br />AN ODD BUNCH OF PEOPLE, ALL WITH A TWIST:<br />The people that wind up in the motel all have something either socially, physically or psychologically off, from a mute boy, to a burned out cop(John Cusack).  There was a fussy obsessive type father, a mortally injured mother, a psycho inmate being transported, his transporter with a big secret(Ray Liotta), a motel owner with a secret, a hooker (Amanda Peet), a self-centered has been movie star (Rebecca De Mornay), a young couple with a psychically sensitive girl and a husband prone to rages.<br />Once the whole group get together, things begin to happen that suggest one of them is killing the others.  The mood is tense and it is not obvious, from the opportunity or the personalities, who might be killing the others.  Many have ample opportunity and the motives range from money to psychotic rage.  However, none point to a single person.<br />INVOLVED PLOT ENDS IN A SINGLE STORY:<br />Without ruining the story for you, I can't go much further.  However the acting is all believable and very well done. The movie never drags.  It ends with all the loose ends tied it in one neat package.

Concerned also of her safety they saddle her with an intern.  His presence though resented by her, provides a conduit/foil for some of her ideas.<br />THE CONVICTED MAN:<br />David Gale (Kevin Spacey)prior to his conviction, was a professor and activist.  He was a well known opponent to the death penalty and fairly high up in a group known as Deathwatch.  These activists regularly picketed prisons where the executions take place. It is with irony that he finds himself so convicted.  His crime is that of cruelly killing a fellow professor who was also active in Deathwatch.<br />OUTLINE OF THE STORY:<br />During the interview, Bitsy feels that David Gale is wrongly convicted.  He states his innocence and offers no ideas for who committed the crime, but relates the event leading up the crime.<br />As she has only 3 days of 2 hours of contact with him, she spends her off time, trying to prove his innocence.  It seems as tense and as hectic as you can imagine it would.  No stay of execution seems likely.<br />IN SUMMARY:<br />I cannot tell you more, in fear, I will unravel the unique ending to this story.  However, this was an excellent movie, right up to the last moment you are holding on to your chair and the ending is very well done.<br />For those of you that want to know, there is some brief nudity that is somewhat disturbing (pictures of the body).  There is some sex, and some rough sex.
B00005JKC3|4.0|This was a true movie for fans of the Hulk who wanted a real adult version of the comic book adaptation.  Ang Lee's version had a heart to the movie that created a real storyline instead of the normal big-budget fake..stuff that hollywood normally grinds out today (see LXG).  This movie had incredible acting, awesome special effects and breathtaking directing to cap it off.  There are some that say that the CG \\"wasn't real enough for me\\" but are probably the same kids that are stuck living in their parents basement overanalyzing every detail of every movie that is released.  Grow up!  This CG fit what this movie was trying to accomplish for its storyline.  As long as you sit down to enjoy a real story of the Hulk, you won't be disappointed from Ang Lee's version.  It may be a little long, but overall it delivered a heart and soul that hasn't been seen in comic book movies to date.  All of you geeks that only look at CG are missing the entire point of moviemaking and should go back to watching Scooby Doo or any other non-sensical stuff that entertains your generation.
B000022TSV|4.0|Las cuatro estrellas en vez de cinco merecidas musicalmente, obedecen a que la pelicula, por lo demas excelente, esta terriblemente llena de ruidos de fondo innecesarios. Hay que pensar que la gloriosa musica de Bizet, realmente no deberia ser interrumpida por los ruidos mencionados; otro detalle que hasta cierto punto hiere nuestro sensibilidad es la presentacion inhumana de los toros al principio ( que me perdonen los espanoles ). Esta crueldad esta demas en verdad. Los cantantes son de primera, no hay que decirlo, y Placido Domingo a quien pudimos ver en nuestro pais, que dicho sea de paso conserva su admirable voz, en esta Carmen es sublime.Las actuaciones teatrales tanto de Domingo como de la soprano son excelentes; en resumen recomiendo esta pelicula grandemente a pesar de los dichosos ruidos mencionados y concluyo diciendo que como pelicula sin la musica, quizas fuera mejor; comparamos esta version con la de Nuria Espert en teatro y ni se diga la admirable de de Anne Sofie von Otter y lamentablemente queda por debajo de estas. La de Carreras tambien es mejor musicalmente.
0792833279|5.0|Quentin Tarantino noted that the movie John Travolta did after &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; was probably more important than &quot;Pulp Fiction&quot; with respect to his comeback in movies.  This movie solidified John's popularity with his core audience.  The movie is smart, irreverent, funny, satirical and just plain cool.  If you watch it, note how the soundtrack is used to compliment the scenes.  The score is almost like another actor in each scene.  It is brought, forcefully, to the forefront of the scenes to provide color and depth.  This rarely works in movies but it is done with considerable skill in &quot;Get Shorty&quot;.  Another &quot;over the top&quot; application is the product placement of the &quot;Cadillac of Mini-Vans&quot;.  They made no excuses and wrote the mini-van right into the script.<BR>This is a very well made movie.  The actors are wonderful, the homage paid to prior films of it's ilk are subtle, yet, crafted skillfully, and the cinematography and music perfectly compliment the film flow and style.<BR>Okay, it's pretty clear I really like this movie.  Nice thing about movies, there are many different movies of all types to satisfy our different tastes.  If you like smart, dark comedies then I think you'll love this one.  Enjoy!
B0000A02TZ|4.0|Back in 1978 when this came out I was a Sophomore at college and hadn't even thought about joining a fraternity. After seeing this movie, I sought out the Greeks on Campus and pledged. The house I joined was very much like Animal House except, we were a commuter school. But, the friendships and the loyalty that was portrayed in the movie was the same.<br />I have collected this movie in the various formats. My first version of this movie was purchased back in 1979 (at full price). It was that influential to me.<br />This new edition takes advantage of the new technology to offer better audio and picture quality as well as neat bonus features such as one mockumetary of what happened to all the characters from the movie and new interviews with the cast. While these features are interesting, there was a documentary of the making of the movie that was produced in 1978. I would have liked to see that on this disk.<br />The one thing that really annoys me about this edition is the 5 minutes of trailers that you are forced to watch when you pop the disk in. I can understand being forced to view the Copyright Notice but, commercials? It only allows you to Fast-Forward through them and not skip them. If I wanted to Fast-Forward through trailers, I could have stuck with my VHS versions. I cut my rating by one star because of this. Universal should stick to paper inserts and make the trailers optional.
B00006L3S3|5.0|Wow, &quot;Cranky Reviewer,&quot; I didn't know John had a time machine. That was so rude of him to travel 20 years into the future and rip off Oasis. Thanks for the laugh, dude. <br />That said, if you can forgive John Lennon for &quot;stealing all his ideas from Oasis&quot; *cough* this is actually a very excellent and solid effort from a legendary performer. The title track is just classic and feature gorgeous arrangement and production. In my opinion, it's the album's strongest track.<br />There are plenty of other gems here though. Both &quot;Meat City&quot; and &quot;Tight A$&quot; contain that classic Lennon wit, the former being a right out rocker and the latter a slightly Western sounding song. The album has its share of slower songs though, the highlight of them being the haunting, yet touching &quot;You Are Here.&quot; <br />While this album may not delve into any incredibly intense  emotional issues (like Walls And Bridges) or seriously push much social agenda, it stands as Lennon's lightest and most fun record. <br />Unfortunately, I can't really comment on exactly what has been &quot;remixed&quot; like some other people have mentioned. The &quot;remixed and remastered&quot; Mind Games was the first and only version of the album that I bought. [so far that is ;) They've all gone and made me curious.]
0060555661|3.0|Although I am mostly a value investor, this has never been my favorite book.  The old 1973 edition which this replaces was dated and the examples were hard to relate  to today's market.   Even the previous editions were not ones I particularly enjoyed.  Quite frankly, the book was and is boring.  Also many of the investment ideas in the book simply do not work in today's market.  For example, I agree with Niederhoffer that buying companies for less that Net Current Assets is ridiculous in general.  Most who claim to be successful at this are simply liars.  This technique worked for a short time following and during the great depression.  But that was basically it.  The idea of approaching one's investments as a business is old hat now but for those not familiar with the concept this book may be worthwhile although whether it is worth buying the book for this tidbit is debatable.  The Buffettology books do this just as well and are more up to date.  Despite the laughter and venom directed against these books they are useful modern investment books which the budding value investor would do well to read.  This update does use more modern examples but with the rise of the internet this type of information is just not as rarely available as it once was. I just wonder how many more &quot;revisions&quot; this book can stand before it becomes like Graham's Security Analysis.  Keep in mind this is a new edition of a book by a man who has been dead for years ( and not the first one at that).  The modern investor would probably be better off learning something about valuation and applying that to determine if companies are undervalued.  The primitive methods in Graham are not particularly useful today and do not reflect the methods of today's successful value investor.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Matrix reloaded, being the second in the series, did not provide most of the elements that mde the original so good, but instead provides others. Instead of being concerned with a discovery and explanation of what the matrix is, reloaded expands on themes and surpasses any other summer movie by miles. I really could have done without the dance/sex scene, and Neo and Trinity's relationship should not have just been assumed to be romantic from the start. But other than that, the rest of the movie was really fun to watch (and I'll probably watch it a few more times to try to figure out all the symbolism). Some elements I really liked were the whole key thing, Neo's choice dilemma, the return of Hugo Weaving as Agt. Smith (and Agt. Smith, and Agt. Smith..), and the introduction of the twins. Overall, you can't not see this movie. You've already made that choice, now you must act.
B000059MEK|5.0|One of the best albums in the world. Now for the song reviews.<br />One More Time- The best song on the album. Not long enough in my opinion.<br />Aerodynamic- One More Time leads right into this good (but not great) song.<br />Digital Love- Corny, but still listenable.<br />Harder, Better, Faster, Stronger- A high point in the album, the perfect length, it's got everything.<br />Crescendolls- An OK track.<br />Nightvision- Less than 2 minutes, not long enough.<br />Superheroes- OK, but the Barry Manilow echo is annoying.<br />High Life- Didn't pay much attention.<br />Something About Us- A slow song with vocals, perfect for a wedding.<br />Voyager-<br />Veridis Quo-<br />Short Circuit- Whoever did the review for Amazon needs to get a life. It's another high point, along with One More Time.<br />Face to Face- Should've been on the radio.<br />Too Long- Great song, but it is literally too long.
B00004Z459|3.0|I'm not really into rap metal, but this could be a good exception, because Linkin Park has many elements that makes them stand out of the rest nu-metal groups.<BR>Personally, I think that they can do much better, for example, Mike Shinoda isn't really necessary and makes the group win a Pop reputation, lowering the standarts of this pack of musicians.<BR>The album is a good start for people that are not much used to rock music.

B000000WI6|4.0|1991s \\"Let Me In\\" features thirteen primarily electric songs, a good, sympathetic little band, and guest appearances by harpist Billy Branch and R&B-veteran Dr John. The good doctor plays piano on several tracks, getting off a particularly terrific solo on \\"Sugaree\\", and Billy Branch's amplified harp duets with Johnny Winter's gritty slide guitar on the WInter-penned slow blues \\"If You got a Good Woman\\", and plays tasteful fills on a fine cover of Jimmy Reed's \\"Shame Shame Shame\\".    \\"Let Me In\\" is certainly one of Winters' better latter-day efforts. It featuring some magnificent, blazing guitar playing (of course it does), and a number of really good performances, including the energetic opener, \\"Illustrated Man\\", and the magnificent acoustic title track, a Son House-like slide guitar blues right out of the Delta. Johnny Winter is one of the best white musicians I have ever heard play the acoustic slide guitar, and this song brings back memories of his masterful playing on Muddy Waters' \\"Hard Again\\" album.    And the goodies keep coming. The aforementioned \\"If you Got a Good Woman\\" channels the late, great Elmore James, Winter plays a smouldering electric solo on the soulful, if uncharacteristic, ballad \\"Life Is Hard\\", and he and Mac Rebennack show off their chops on the swaggering Dr John-penned blues-rocker \\"You Lie Too Much\\". Oh, and don't forget to notice the jazzy throwback \\"Blue Mood\\", a slow, smoky number penned by 50s songwriter Jessie Mae Robinson.    But in order to be fair I also have to mention that Winter's somewhat predictable versions of old-time rockers like \\"Barefootin'\\" and \\"You're Humbuggin' Me\\" may not be to the liking of those fans who prefer his bluesier side, and there are a couple of bland, generic exercises here which never get really off the ground, particularly \\"Hey You\\" and \\"Got to Find my Baby\\".  Still, most of this album is really enjoyable, with something for the blues-lovers and something for the rock n' roll fans, too, and \\"Let Me In\\" is a very fine purchase for Winter fans, even if it fails to live up to his best 60s and 70s efforts. And Winter's guitar prowess remain almost unchallenged.  A good one! 4 1/4 stars. Yep, have to have that quarter star there...
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I won't bother with extolling on the merits of other people's<br />reviews...everyone has an opinion right? That's why I am on here<br />stating mine. I also won't go into great detail on the tastiness<br />of THIS work, I am going to leave it to you...the REAL Neil Young fans..if you have followed Neil for very long, then you will KNOW. What I will say is this: No other story teller in music today that I know of, can switch directions and do it successfully as well as Neil can, I don't mean drastically. But<br />Greendale is definitely another switch and it just continues to prove the man's genius. I too went to the concert, just a few weeks prior to this review. I was skeptical at first myself. I always wonder how a &quot;concept&quot; album, as such, will work..so I admit I was a little leary.  BUT, and this is a big BUT..If anyone could do it I reasoned, it would be Neil. Well I was right. The story of the Green family is inspired. The music is heartfelt. THE electric version with Crazy Horse is dynamite! And Neil plays as good as he STILL sings. The acoustic version is inspirational and equally as good. I have followed Neil since his days with Buffalo Springfield. This is a great work of art. It is a story, so listen to it a few times before you render judgement...BUT, as I say, if you like Neil and you KNOW who you are...You will like this very much.
0385504209|5.0|This book was an excellent work that I couldn't put down!!!  I really enjoyed Dan Brown's writing style as well and am looking forward to reading some of his other books. I recommend this book to Everyone!
B00009TB5G|5.0|This movie is better than the majority, if not all movies made since the making of Star Wars Return of the Jedi (1983)  everything(fantasy/sci-fi wise) since has been frilly cheap hollywood B. S. & corny dialogue.  Lord of the Rings(both movies) are magical and beautiful and well written and acted.  For you who are knocking the \\"Purists\\" I wouldn't waste my time on those geeks. Thier opinion means nothing.  Dungeons and Dragon nerds are not the ones to rate a movie!<br />I don't let some geek tell me how to make it, watch it, or play it!<br />Two Towers is much better than the first(although the first was very good)  and tells the deeper elements of the story, whereas the first mainly introduced the characters.  Gollumn's internal conflict was the best part of all, good is not always good, Gollumn isn't totally evil.  The Battle was excellent as well with Aragorn at the front and countless warriors and clever fighting moves. The only mar was that elves live longer than humans and Aragorn would be elderly but Aowen would go on eternal. How can you love someone that doesn't age when you do? I do not own the DVD, but I have seen the movie and can rate it somewhat accurately(it IS the movie that counts, not the extras).  Go see it in the theater again but as for the DVD's wait for the final release of the LoR trilogy and collect all of the DVDS at once!
B00000J7A2|1.0|I decided to listen to this CD because of High Fidelity... All I can say is, no wonder it was a nerdy, dorky loser in the movie trying to get a copy of this ridiculously dull trash. I bet all of Beefheart's fans look like him. Even the girls.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|this short lived sci-fi western about a motley space-ship crew set in a reconstructionist future truly stands out as a sparkling gem in tv history. created by Buffy: the vampire slayer mastermind Joss Whedon this show was doomed by poor promotion and a dodgy timeslot. This DVD set(which comes packed with extras) will offer viewers a chance to see it again it all its glory. It's no wonder that firefly fans(called Browncoats, see the show to learn why) have rallied around it since the beginning and never gave up hope. It was recently announced that a firefly movie is in the works, so this is the perfect chance for fans and non-fans to catch up and see what all the fuss is about!
B00006AW2J|5.0|Beggars Banquet is one of the top 5 Stones albums. This was when they became one of the best bands in rock history, this album contains 'Sympathy For The Devil' and the hard rock songs played with acoustic guitars 'Street Fighting Man' but thats not it this album is more it has 'Parachute Woman' 'Jig-Saw Puzzle' and 'Strey Cat Blues' all of which are amazing songs. Then their are the softer folkyer songs which are great as well. This album was a start of a new Rolling Stones with this they wereo longer a Sycadelic band but a real rock band, and boy were they ever good, after this was released the Stones came across a long carrer of succes with his album after hit album and hit song after hit song. You must own this as it truly is a masterpeace!
B00008NG5V|5.0|This is a truly solid album. I can think of only a handful of cd's that are a pleasure to listen to track after track -- this is one. Fans of Brushfire Fairytales will like this album as much, if not more, than his first, and will appreciate his consistently strong melodies fused with fresh lyrics. On and On is just about the perfect summer album -- full of catchy groves and harmonic simplicity. Of course, with such great tunes as Traffic in the Sky, Times Like These, and Rodeo Clowns, I'm sure this will stand the test of time at least as well as Jack Johnson's first album did.
B00006AW2G|5.0|This is one of the Rolling Stones best known albums and by many conciderd the greatest album of all time, and I can see why. You get an album full of nothing but good songs. The guitar here is amazing, Keith plays great ryhtm and Brian Jones plays some of the best slide work you will ever hear. I must mention 'Gimme Shelter' I think it is the best Rolling Stones song. I love the guitar the vocals the lyrics, I mean whats not to like about this song? This was a landmark album, and on some plain the standard to which all rock albums should be compaired. some stand out tracks are 'You Cant Always Get What You Want' 'Monkey Man' and Midnight Rambler' these are great songs and all became concert staples for the band. Another song I must mention is 'Country Honk' it is really a remake of 'Honky Tonk Women' it has the same lyrics and almost the same music. You must own this album even if you are not a Rolling Stones fan.
B000063DFN|5.0|I've noticed that, in all the \\"Greatest Hard Rock Albums\\" of all time lists in magazines and on TV, whenever Iron Maiden is listed, their greatest accomplishment is hailed as being \\"Number Of The Beast.\\" Although it is a good album as well, I'd have to say that \\"Powerslave\\" tops it. Mainly because of two outstanding songs here: \\"Aces High\\", and \\"2 Minutes To Midnight\\". Here's a song by song synopsis of the album:<br />Aces High - I never get tired of this song. The guitar leads are simply amazing, and the solo is great too. The lyrics are interesting and great as well, depicting an British air pilots role during the battle over the English Channel during WWII.<br />2 Minutes To Midnight - A great song, with deep lyrics, describing the terrors of numclear bombs, supposedly. The gutiar theme is hooky, and Bruce's vocals are good as well.<br />3. Losfer Words (Big 'Orra) - Probably my least favorite song here. Although it is a unique and good piece of work, it just dosen't meet the standards the rest of the album had set.<br />4. Flash Of The Blade - Mean and dirty guitar intro, with a biting tone. The story is anotehr of those \\"ancient combat\\" ones, that Iron Maiden excelled at writing into songs.<BR>Of course, it's aobut a swordsman.<br />5. The Duellists - Another one about sowrdfighters. Good tune, one of the best songs here. Not as good as most songs here, but it's still beyond par. All in all, a good song.<br />6. Back In The Village - A really cool song, although the chorus is somewhat weak, and not as energized as the rest of the song.<BR>Yet, it's killer guitar riffage and driving percussion are simply put, admirable.<br />7. Powerslave - Probably my second favorite song here. My first being, of course, Aces High. The story is unique and somewhat haunting, but with a rough edge. A wonderful guitar solo, powerful imagery, as well as powerful music blend perfectly into this work of art that is the title track,<br />8. Rime Of The Ancient Mariner - Clocking in atnearly 14 minutes, \\"Rime...\\" is perhaps the best song here. But I still pick \\"Aces High\\" as my favortie. It vies for second place with \\"Pwerslave. Being about 14 minutes, then, it's obvious that the band has quite a bit of stuff to cram in there. And they do. Well-crafted, mapped-out guitar leads, driving rhythms, and so forth all mesh perfectly. The lyrics are good as well, and were inspied by a poem of the same name.<br />So, to wrap it all up, I'll finish by saying that \\"Powerslave\\" is Maiden's best, yes, you should buy it, if that's what you're wondering, and yes, AC/DC is a [great] band. I higly reccomend you check them out, if you haven't already. <BR>Well, I hope my review has helped, and I hope to see an increase in the sales of heavy metal and rock albums, instead of [stuff] like rap, pop, hip-hop, and all that stuff.<BR>See ya later! Love and peace to all!
0385504209|3.0|This book, as expressed by other reviewers, was definitely a page turner and a bit of a mystery/thriller with a great deal of disjointed symbolism from history, religion, and science thrown in. It definitely falls into the &quot;pulp&quot; category however, rather than a substantive exploration of the subjects it addresses, due to the thinness of the plot, stock characters, forced interjection of romance, endless pop culture references, aand predictable &quot;surprise&quot; ending. Hopefully, it feeds the reader enough tidbits of knowledge about Paganism and early Christianity to encourage delving into When God was a Woman, The Chalice and the Blade, and other non-fiction books. The Mists of Avalon, a fictional feminist revision of the Arthurian legend, is a much better book that tells a story and leads the reader to knowledge.
B00009XITP|2.0|This movie was a genuine bore. There were a couple entertaining pieces here and there...but they only lasted for about a minute. Nothing was particularly clever or funny about it. Peach &amp; Pear were the best characters due to their names alone. Other than that I didn't much like it at all. I actually didn't finish the last half hour or so---and unlike good movies, I'm not sorry about that.
B00004U2EZ|5.0|I saw the play!, is magisterial, the voices, the coreography and everything was magic, Bruno Pelletier has an extraordinary voice and his performance is outstanding, Garou is the Best Quasimodo ever, Clopin played by Luck Mervil has so many textures and movement. You should appreciate the play and the soundtrack you are going to love it!.
B00008EY9G|4.0|IDENTITY is a clever premise that is expertly executed.  This flick pulls you in with an honestly good mix of atmosphere, pacing, plotting, and performance.  A feeling of impending doom shrouds the story revolving around a group of strangers stranded at a remote motel in the unending rain.  When they start getting bumped off one by one ala AGATHA CHRISTIE, the fun begins as the interesting plot unfolds into something unexpectedly non cookie cutter hollywood.  The movie plows though it's ninety minutes and gives the viewer some cool unexpected curves.  An excellent late night noirish chiller that hits the mark.  The 'alternate ending' on the DVD is really nothing special.  There are very subtle differences that do not change the impact of the film.    The film itself, however, is well worth it.
0783241569|5.0|Hugh Grant's role as Travel Book Shop employee William Thacker reprises the same shy, humble, lovable, but lonely character with a small group of friends that made him a star in Four Weddings And A Funeral.  That may be because Notting Hill, like FW&amp;AF, was written by Richard Curtis.  &quot;And so it was another hopeless Wednesday when I walked a thousand yards to work, not suspecting that this was going to be the day my life would be changed forever.&quot;  In two words, that catalyst is Anna Scott, currently one of Hollywood's biggest stars, who is promoting her latest film Helix, a sci-fi film whose costume design and one interior setting owes a nod to Kubrick's 2001.  She happens in his bookshop, but that first meeting sets off a series of meetings where they spend time with each other.<br />Eccentric barely describes Spike, his Welsh roommate with a shock of wild blond hair.  Never have I seen a more comical opposites since Felix and Oscar of the Odd Couple.  Spike is clearly the Oscar of the pair, but then again, I doubt if Oscar would have worn a T-shirt saying, &quot;Get It Here&quot;, with an arrow pointing downwards, or unwittingly mistake mayonnaise for yogurt.<br />In the course of meeting Anna, he in turn introduces her to his small group, including a married couple, Max and Belle, the latter in a wheelchair, a stockbroker named Bernie, and William's wild-looking sister Honey, whose bulging eyes and feathery hair makes her nevertheless lovable in a different sort of way.<br />However, they live in two different worlds.  As William puts it, &quot;I live in Notting Hill, you live in Beverly Hills.&quot;  Both have different schedules, lifestyles, and perspectives on things.  Yet his inner smile lights up whenever she pops in and spends some time with him.  And applying a metaphor used, Anna is a goddess.  &quot;You know what happens to mortals who get involved with the gods?&quot;  That's terrible for William, who confides in Spike that it's like &quot;taking love heroin and I couldn't have it again.

Ouch!  But despite the fame, in the end, she's &quot;just a girl asking a boy to love her.&quot;<br />The one pullback aerial shot that has the couple approaching the bench dedicated to a loved one, while Ronan Keating sings Keith Whitley's &quot;When You Say Nothing At All&quot; was a perfect combination of great camera work enhanced by a haunting love song.<br />Hugh Grant has another winning role and seems to have the knack of starring opposite great female leads and being compatible.

B00005M91K|5.0|And crank down the bass a little (if you have a subwoofer).<br />This movie gives the person with their DVD players, SUV and well- paying job to see something in this world that the viewer most likely has not seen, which is an intimate look at cultures, environments and nature the world over. With no concern of SARS or an expensive plane ticket, you feel afterwards that you truly experienced a global tour.<br />Baraka begins at a rather cautious pace, and as each scene passes by your vision, the intensity and depth slowly but steadily increases. It's a bit hard to describe, but I feel in a way that it causes the viewer to look inward at his/her own view of what the world is about and what life means. In a way, it compells you to ask yourself some deep questions. Make sure to keep your attention on watching the movie with NO interruptions to get the full effect. Pausing for phone calls, snacks or bathroom breaks is verboten, so get everything done first!<br />Baraka unfolds in the early morning and as the film passes through the first 10 minutes or so, you see examples of different beliefs and religions mixed with clips of nature. Eventually the two collide. And by the end, you're amazed at the solar eclipse and lunar starfields. Yet Ron Fricke's intent wasn't to make any statement at all.<br />There are elements of almost every type mixed into the film from peaceful co- existance to conflict (no graphic footage, don't worry), faith, technology, beauty and struggle. In some ways you may feel helpless after watching the slow decay/destruction of the world at the hands of mankind, yet Fricke also inserts visions which somehow reassure that nature ultimately holds the key to the fate of human beings since she is infinitely more powerful (and is much more patient).<br />If you get the chance, sample Baraka (a national video rental place has it on stock in special interest, so you can take a peek at it), and you'll more than likely want to own this. The majority of filming is either in slow motion or in time lapse, with not a single word spoken.

B00005NRQE|5.0|Motorbikes with multiple rear view mirrors and headlights, pills, snack bar hangouts, gang rumbles, and music by the Who.  Quadrophenia, executive produced by the Who, with music produced by bassist John Entwistle, captures a slice of Britain in the 1960's.  True, the strong accents may not be understandable to untrained American ears, but to an Anglophile such as myself, it was music to my ears.<br />The interraction between Jimmy and his friends.  He's really taken with Steph, a prize blonde in their circle who seems to be hanging around another Mod.  However, he ignores Monkey, who's a nice enough girl, but who in his eyes pales when put aside Steph.  Her reaction at his not noticing her is telling, as she seems to have a thing for him.  He does okay around the others, such as Dave, Spider, and a black guy named Ferdy, who's the one to go to for buying blues, pills that is.  Most curious is the way he sees Kevin, a friend of his who went in the army and left, only to become a Rocker.<br />Jimmy's life as the post-room boy seems unrewarding.  In fact he steals some cheesecake photos he was supposed to deliver and keeps them.  Hmm, were those \\"pictures of Lily\\"?  His late nights also cause consternation to his parents, and he answers them with equal vituperation.  He is a typical enough boy, with ... pin-ups, newspaper clippings of Mods versus Rocker riots, and pictures of the Who on his bedroom wall.<br />A telling scene about what the movie's thematically about comes during a conversation between Kevin and Jimmy.  Kevin says he doesn't care one bit about the whole Mods and Rockers nonsense.  Jimmy then says, \\"I don't want to be the same as everybody else.  That's why I'm a Mod, see?  I mean, you gotta be somebody, ain't ya?  Or you might as well jump in the sea and drown.\\"<br />Yet there's the contradiction of being a Mod just to be somebody.  Jimmy's father tells him to have a mind of his own instead of being in a gang.  For Kevin, it seems to be just the difference in musical tastes, i.e. Gene Vincent versus The Kinks.  Jimmy has nailed his Mod colours to the mast to the hilt.<br />When Jimmy is watching The Who performing \\"Anyway, Anywhere, Anyhow\\" on Ready Steady Go, and turns up the volume on the tellie while jamming to it, his father tells him, \\"That'll make you deaf, you know\\", which is ironic given Pete Townshend's later hearing problems and the Who's notoriously high decibel concerts.  Apart from Cathy McGowan's show, the non-Who music such as the Ronettes, Crystals, and the Kingsmen<br />There are a few gang confrontations, ranging from jeering from motorbikes, down to fisticuffs.  When Spider, a Mod, \\"gets a right kicking\\" from Rockers, that means reprisal time, and woe be to any Rockers hanging out.<br />The climactic riot scene in the holiday seaside resort of Brighton on the Bank Holiday is the most memorable part of the movie.  At first, it's almost like a convention or motorbike rally before things get nasty.  While I don't condone the violence and property damage, this exciting scene plays a crucial part of 1960's Britain, very reminiscent of similar gang rumbles in the America in the 1950's.<br />Second in memorability is the break-in at the chemist's to get some blues, and the frantic tension broken by moments of comedy works very well.  And when everybody is jamming to \\"My Generation\\" at a party, the way the Mods get into the song is very high energy.<br />Phil Daniels plays Jimmy as someone who wants to fit in, yet remain an individual, equally befuddled and disillusioned.<br />Many of the other leads, particularly the Mods, stand out as their vivid personalities capture the period detail, Leslie Ash as Steph, Mark Wingstad as Dave, Gary Shail as Spider, and in particular, Raymond Winstone as Kevin.  Pop singer Toyah Willcox does well as Monkey.  Despite having a small role as Ace, Sting's role is important in the Brighton scene.  Hey, he even got to yank a cop off his horse and do some serious messingabout.<br />The Who's contribution to rock operas translated into movies should not be understated.  Quadrophenia remains as it ever will be, a classic, nostalgic time capsule of a time sadly long gone.  Love Reign O'er It!about.<br />The Who's contribution to rock operas translated into movies should not be understated.

B0000A1RJI|3.0|After watching Pirates of the Caribbean for the first time I RUSHED out the theater, humming the last tune all the way to Target where I searched for the Soundtrack only to discover it hadn't been released yet.  I had to hum for the entire 45 minute drive back home (a one star deduction)....<br />Here's what I want:  As I walk out the door of the movie, I want theater employees standing at the door offering me a small CD with 20 minutes of the last song on it.  (Or, offer it to movie goers for an extra $2 - $5 with the purchase of a ticket.)  I wanted to pop the CD into my car so that I could keep being empowered by the movie even after I got home.  When you think about it, why don't they sell Soundtracks in movie theaters along with the popcorn, etc.? <br />Then I want to get on Amazon.com and purchase the Soundtrack along with other \\"fun\\" items that remind me of the movie.  Product examples could include -- stuff to put in my hair (or a keychain) like Jack Sparrow, possibly a bandana like Sparrow's, or a clear bumper sticker for my car that says \\"The Black Pearl,\\" or a gold medallion necklace....(you'd have to unjinx it or give it to your enemies), treasure chest filled with \\"Pirate Booty\\" gold and silver sculptural objects (could be \\"limited edition\\"), hologram pirate cards where the pirates change into skeletons, a little desk size replica of The Black Pearl.  Perhaps some of this exists already at Disneyland.  I like things that come organically from the movie, the story itself, created by the various designers who worked on the movie......<br />Judging by the comments here, I think you could release at least a single -- almost everyone wants MORE of this music...if something so simple could empower people...why not create it....people could use it in their workouts, to inspire them when their work becomes dull.  \\"Symphonic\\" or not, there is some \\"magic\\" in this music that stirs the imagination.  How dare you keep it all to yourself (a one star deduction for being stingy)....<br />Of course, I will be able to get the music when the DVD comes out, but it would be nice to have just the pure music....(hint, hint)....

B00003CXSP|3.0|I have never have been so mad at the ending of a movie.  Before I go into that let me just say that again Anthony Hopkins as always is great as hannibal lecter and Julianne Moore played Starling just as good as Jodie Foster.  And Gary Oldman's uncredited performance as Mason Verger was also well done.  That is about all the good things I can say about this movie and those 3 performances are why I gave this movie 3 stars.  This movie butchered the book, and the parts that were left out hurt the movie too.  In the book you understand why the italian cop tries to catch lecter himself and turn him over to verger in the movie they cut that part out!  I won't even go into the characters that are missing.  The ending was what really irked me.  I guess the ending pushed the envelope a little too far for Ridely Scott or something, but was very weak in my view.  The DVD does have some nice extra's but the movie is not that memorable.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.
B00005JLSE|4.0|Roxie Hart is a wanabe singer from Chicago who dreams of reaching the stage someday.  When she kills her lover in a fit of rage, she doesn't realize how close she's about to become to her dream.  In prison, she hooks up with lawyer Billy Flynn, and another singer in prison, Velma Kelly.  Watching Velma work Billy and getting her name in the paper is all Roxie needs.  She lures her husband into supporting her legal problems and hires Billy to be her attorney.  Before she knows it, Roxie is more famous then she ever dreamed she'd become.  Intersped with musical numbers that help tell the story, Chicago is a satire about the control the media holds over it's audience.<br />If you're a fan of musicals, or even if you're not, you will truly enjoy the musical numbers in Chicago.  They have a twenties theme and are worked very well into the context of the story.  The performances are outstanding, with my personal favorite being Richard Gere as Flynn.  This was definitely an underated performance.  One flaw with the film is it's lack of likeable characters.  Roxie is hardly likeable in the ways she treats her husband, and what she will do to be famous.  Velma is an arrogant woman who sees herself in a higher light then everyone else.  Billy is a lawyer who only cares about the bottom line.  And, Roxie's husband Amos, probably the most sympathetic, is also a fool, making him hard to like.<br />The DVD is a little bare as far as DVD's go.  Only three extras to speak of, an informative behind-the-scenes documentary which runs 30 minutes, a director's commentary, and a four-minute musical number with Queen Latifah and Catherine Zeta-Jones which was cut.  For the best picture winner, you'd think they would come out with a fully loaded DVD.<br />Overall, Chicago is a wonderful cinematic experience, with only a few flaws.  But as you fall into the musical numbers, you will soon forget the flaws.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|I absolutly love this film. Everything is masterfully excuted from the fight scenes to the plot to the freeway scene(which is utterly mental). The freeway scene surpasses every other car chase past and furture. The only thing i didnt like was neo's new coat which is kinda gay but doesnt ruin the film. I will be buying this the second it is released and seeing revelutions the second that is released.
B00008LDPU|3.0|Having enjoyed both Matrix movies, I was very excited to heard that they had made a DVD consisting of animated spin-offs. However, upon renting this, I found it to be somewhat dissapointing. <br />Though it was very intersting to learn &quot;How it all began&quot; with the war between the humans and the robots, I thought that it was presented in an &quot;overly-violent&quot; manner. My companions and I felt rather ill while watching some of the shorts. They made both of the other movies seem like Sesame Street. <br />However, dispite the over-done violence in a few of the films, the stories were all beautifully told and the animation was simply breath-taking. (My personal favorites being &quot;The last Flight of Osiris&quot; and &quot;Kid's Story&quot;.)<br />I advise Matrix fans to rent this movie, but before you do, make sure the kids are in bed.

0451204530|1.0|Is this the same guy who wrote Eye of the Needle and The Key to Rebecca? This book recounts an allegedly fictional story behind the headlines of the \\"space race\\".

However, the \\"memory struggle\\" of the book's main character becomes repetitive and tedious and the language between characters hollow.<br />It's a shame that this book wasn't better having come from a very good author equipped with an interesting story line.  Perhaps the author was thinking too much about Hollywood and too little about a really good book.
B00005JLKN|4.0|So close to being as good or even better than silence of the lambs.  The book was the best in the series but the movie fell just short.  It wasn't the actors' fault, Anthony Hopkins plays Hannibal Lecter better than anybody could have ever dreamed of and Edward Norotn and Ralph Fiennes are always tailor made for their roles.  It just seemed to lack the creepiness of the book.  If they would have spent a little more time with the killer like the book did I think it would have been a much better movie.  However it is still a good thriller that will have you sleeping with the lights on.  Of course that is just my opnion, I could be wrong.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Talk about turning a genre inside out. The suspenseful Identity has all the twists and turns of a maze with just as many dead ends. The film starts out like a conventional thriller about a psychotic killer and an attempt to stay his execution. A parallel plot focuses on 10 people who are all trapped at an isolated motel due to a horrible storm.<br />Suddenly, one of them is picking the others off one by one. There's something almost supernatural about the way this version of And Then There None plays. John Cusack plays a former LA cop who is transporting an actress to Los Angeles. He, along with the other 9 individuals, ends up being trapped at this hotel.<br />James Mangold creates considerably suspense with his unorthodox aproach to the material. The screenplay was --surprise--written by the screenwriter for Jack Frost and Jack Frost 2. Actually, I'm not surprised he wrote those absurd slasher flicks. They played with the conventions of the genre albeit less successfully and with a much weaker premise than Identity.<br />The cast all give fine performances particularly the edgy Ray Liotta and John Cusack. Rebecca Morney and Amanda Peet subvert the stereotypical roles their assigned in the movie and also give fine, strong performances. Identity reminds me of Psycho crossed with And Then There Were None. While the mystery at the heart of the film is important, like many amusement rides, it's also about the twists and turns you take on the rollercoaster that are just as important.<br />The DVD features a special extended version as well as the theatrical version. Both are very effective although I found the theatrical version a bit more powerful--the suspense is unrelenting. Identity would be the type of picture that Hitchcock might have done in his prime (if it was possible to do these types of films during his day)or Jonathan Demme when his work was edgier (a la Silence of the Lambs or Some Like It Wild).<br />The picture and sound are outstanding and the interactive menu is quite clever as well. The deleted scenes do add a bit more of character depth but, on the whole, it's clear why they were cut--it hurt the pacing of the picture. Why the film includes both the widescreen and fullscreen versions is beyond me. I realize that some folks prefer fullscreen but that's what the zoom feature on DVDs are for. All of the grit and grime of Mangold's stylized visual compositions are aparent on this terrific transfer. There's also a director commentary but I'd suggest watching the film without it the first time as it might spoil some of the &quot;secrets&quot; of the film.<br />It's a pity this terrific thriller wasn't marketed better or released in a less crowded market; it could easily have been the next Silence of the Lambs or Psycho. In the meantime while you're watching this film stay out of dark motel rooms and avoid looking in the mirror.tive menu is quite clever as well.

0793927501|5.0|This is a wonderful film that will keep the viewer totally absorbed. Written by the tremendously talented David Mamet (The House of Games, Oleanna), it is  beautifully directed by the noted director Lee Tamahori (Once Were Warriors, Along Came a Spider). The film is a complex, fully fleshed story covering many themes, fully realized by a stellar cast.  It also provides the viewer with breathtaking cinematography, as well as a compelling score written by Academy Award winner Jerry Goldsmith (The Omen).<br />The film focuses an a mild mannered, self-effacing, slightly paranoid billionaire, Charles Morse (Anthony Hopkins). A brilliant and well-read man with a penchant for esoteric knowledge, Morse is married to Mickey (Elle MacPherson), a young and beautiful, successful model. On location with her in a remote area of Alaska, she is surrounded by her young, fun loving camera crew, while he is seemingly the odd man out. He is astute enough, however, to sense that there are romantic  undercurrents between his wife and her photographer, Robert Green (Alec Baldwin).<br />When Morse accompanies Robert on what was to be a short excursion into the Alaskan wilderness, looking for a local hunter to pose in the photo shoot, disaster looms ahead, and the test for the survival of the fittest begins. It is here that the superior mind and knowledge of Morse is put to the test, as they find themselves pitted against nature. Morse rises to the occasion, emerging as a natural leader, while his younger, fitter rival, Robert, is often at a loss as to how to cope in their peculiar situation. It is also through the emerging and changing conditions that they face, that their respective characters emerge. It is in the wilderness that they are both unmasked and emerge as their true selves.<br />This is a film that will keep the viewer enthralled. Anthony Hopkins has never been better as the quietly heroic Morse, and Alec Baldwin is excellent as the craven and duplicitous photographer who has cuckolded him. Elle MacPherson is luminous as the beautiful, young, trophy wife. The rest of the supporting cast, including the giant Kodiac bear, are also terrific. This is a superlative survival story that has something for everyone. Bravo!uckolded him. Elle MacPherson is luminous as the beautiful, young, trophy wife.

B00005V3Z4|5.0|Director Richard Kelly tells us in the DVD extras that he felt like Donnie is a superhero that's been given a job to do. Watch it like it's a comic about an ordinary, not-so-mild-mannered schoolboy that's been given a mission from up high.  I liked the film a lot when I first saw it, but what makes this one special (like so many others) is the way you get something new each time you see it. <BR>   <BR>   There are so many great things to say about the plot that it's not worth it to write.  Suffice it to say that it's never boring, always original and will remind you of.......nothing.  There's no other movie like this.  It's some crazy blend of thriller, comedy, drama and sci-fi. Maybe that means Kelly has created a new category.  I certainly think that any movie that's hard to classify is a winner.<br />   The cast is superb. Each play their part to perfection; you sympathize with Donnie, hate the health teacher, love the two young teachers, fear Frank, and despise Jim Cunningham.  When bigshot actors like Patrick Swayze, Drew Barrymore and Mary McDonnell all play small parts, you know that they did this movie not for the money, but because they believed in this film.  They trusted the rookie director, and they were right to do so.<br />   Religion pervades the film, and with careful viewing, you can get a whole new perspective that hopefully will serve as an inspiration to both agnostics and believers.  It might remind you of another young man that willingly gave his life for the people and the world that he loved.  If you get the DVD, watch all the extras, and you'll get a lot more out of it.  Rent it, buy it, borrow it, but whatever you do, don't go without seeing this stunning achievement.

B000006XSD|5.0|In 1977, Alice Cooper released his greatest album of the 1970s. This album is one of Alice Cooper's greatest solo efforts to date. The album is loud, heavy, trashy and definately a MASTERPIECE! The collaboration of Alice Cooper, guitarist Dick Wagner and producer Bob Ezrin was the perfect formula for this album. Alice and Wagner wrote great heavy metal classics such as \\"It's Hot Tonight\\", \\"Lace & Whiskey\\", \\"Road Rats\\", \\"Damned If You Do\\", the ballad \\"You And Me\\" and \\"Ubangi Stomp.\\" With Ezrin's producing, the album sounded like a MASTERPIECE and it IS!<br />The opener \\"It's Hot Tonight\\" has excellent loud guitar solos by Wagner along the great set of lyrics by Alice. The beats and the guitar riffs are just out of the world. The title track \\"Lace & Whiskey\\" is a real catchy tune and is another Alice classic. The next track \\"Road Rats\\" is definately without a doubt the heaviest track on the album with loud squelling guitars and real trashy lyrics by the Nightmare child himself. It's definately a 5-Star Masterpiece!<br />The next track \\"Damned If You Do\\" is a very catchy tune and has a good swing in the lyrics to it. The chorus line lyrics go like \\"You're Damned If You Do, damned if you don't. Damned if you do, damned if you won't.\\" Another classic Alice ballad is \\"You And Me.\\" This ballad easily fits right in with 1975's \\"Only Women Bleed,\\" and 1976's \\"I Never Cry.\\" The song is basically about marriage life and the loving relationship between a husband and wife. It's the perfect ballad for a married couple to listen to.<br />This track \\"Ubangi Stomp\\" is a real classic rock tune. It's sounds a lot like a 50's rock song. It's a another catchy tune. Alice sings the lyrics also in a 50's tone as if he's a 50's rocker. Alice and Dick did a great collaboration on this tune. Without a doubt it is a classic.<br />This album \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" is a Alice Cooper MASTERPIECE! It is definately one of the top albums of 1977 along with KISS's \\"Love Gun.\\" After I bought this album and added it to my Alice collection I fell more and more in Alice MANIA! This album is the Alice Cooper we haven't seen before. Enjoy \\"Lace and Whiskey\\" as much I do.m and added it to my Alice collection I fell more and more in Alice MANIA!

B00005OAIE|2.0|there's a few good tracks mostly kind of wimpy even the good ones wear thin really quickly. comparisons to Dave Matthews I find insane. there is nowhere near the fire and musical talent of Dave in John Mayer.
B00005RYLE|5.0|If you've never seen Evil Dead, you're probably wondering what all the fuss is about. This is one of those movies that every horror fan has either seen or won't admit if he or she hasn't. Not to mention, it's a must for anyone's DVD collection, if only because this is the film that introduced the world to the likes of Sam Raimi and Bruce Campbell. <br />The plot is simple enough. A group of college students vacation at an isolated cabin, only to unwittingly unleash demonic spirits and one by one become possessed by them. Won't you kids ever learn?<br />What seperates this from other horror fare is Raimi's innovative directing. Even in his first film, his talent for visual flair enhances nearly every scene. At one point, his camera maniacally chases a character through the woods, and at another, he splatters the camera with blood, drenching the scene in red. In fact, Raimi does his darnedest to make this film unlike anything else you've experienced in a horror movie. On particular scene comes to mind, an infamous scene where vines out in the woods &quot;take advantage of&quot; (for the lack of a subtler term) one of the female characters. This is one of those scenes that's so outrageous, it sticks with you long after the movie is finished.<br />By today's standards, most viewers won't find the movie terribly scary. However, Raimi does a nice job at setting the proper atmosphere with creaky porch swings, creepy fruit cellers, and plenty of trees and fog. Considering the low budget, some of the effects are nicely done. One of my favorites include Bruce Campbell touching a mirror, only to have his hand sink into it like a pool of water. Very cool. Sure, some of the scenes are now corny or ridiculous (as both Raimi and company admit during the commentary), but that's just part of the appeal, right? <br />The acting isn't great, but what do you expect from a B-movie? Campbell hasn't quite turned into the Ash-character popularized by its sequels, but he plays the role witha nice edge of hopelessness, bordering on cowardice. The supporting characters are passable enough.<br />The DVD extras are a definite bonus, particularly the commentary tracks. Anyone interested in how the film was made and its makers will enjoy both the Raimi/Tapert and Bruce Campbell tracks. If you're buying the &quot;Necronomicon&quot; Limited Edition, a short documentary by Bruce Campell called &quot;FANalysis&quot; is also worth a look. The Limited edition also comes with a replica of the Necronomicon (i.e. the book of the dead) in the film. It's neat, but unless you're a die-hard fan (like me) it's maybe not worth the money that some people would have you fork out for it. <br />The audio and picture of the DVD transfer are amazing; Evil Dead has never looked or sounded better. Fans should be very happy. In short, own this movie! It's a classic.
B00005JKZV|2.0|I know the film can't follow the book but it changed too much, even the animated version was able to follow the book alot closer than this one. This film changed the characters a bit much also especially Faramir.  Yes I agree films can't follow the books too closely but this one went further than the rest.  Yes it was a good film if you hadn't read the book especially the effects.  I don't care how Pippin removed his broach, teeth or hands but changing whole battles as at Helms Deep, where they did have warriors not just old men, women and children.  Elves didn't need to be there to make the battle.  I will not be going to see the next film until it comes out on pay-per-view and I'm feeling curious.
B0000630YA|4.0|In 1975, after the Alice Cooper group broke up, Alice Cooper launched his solo career and his first album was a major success. Alice's first solo effort proves that Alice Cooper is one of the best song writers of all-time. Now let's take a trip into Alice Nightmare.<br />The opening title track, \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is PURE Alice. The first words are \\"Welcome to my nightmare. I think you're gonna like it. I think you're gonna feel yo belong.\\" Alice sings this classic tune with a low-evil voice as if he's actually the devil. The tune is real heavy with an array of instruments and great guitar riffs done by Dick Wagner. Another great track is the melodic \\"Some Folks.\\" It's a real catchy tune with a great set of lyrics. This next track is what made this album extremely popular. Alice's first ballad \\"Only Women Bleed.\\" This is known as one of Alice's greatest ballads EVER! The song shows a passionate side of Alice that you haven't seen before. Some of the lyrics go like, \\"She cries alone at night too often. I smoke and drink and don't come home at all. Only Women Bleed, Only Women Bleed...\\" This ballad is an Alice MASTERPIECE!<br />A really great tune is \\"Cold Ethyl.\\" It's a somewhat heavy tune with a garage rock sound that Alice did excellent on. It's probably one of the heaviest tunes off the album. Another great heavy metal tune is the closer \\"Escape.\\" It's like an addition to \\"Cold Ethyl.\\" It has that garage rock sound also. Definately another Alice classic.<br />This album \\"Welcome To My Nightmare\\" is the beginning of how Alice Cooper made his mark on the world as a Heavy Metal master. If you want to know how Alice Cooper became \\"The Godfather of Shock Rock,\\" this album explains it ALL!
0385504209|5.0|I took this book to be what it was written to be, namely, a fictional story drawn on historical facts. If you do the same, that is, don't take it too seriously, you will find it to be a great read. The author, Dan Brown, did a great job of writing a fictional story, somewhat of a fantasy, presenting it within the framework of true history. It is unique. The only other author I have seen who did that is Norman Thomas Remick in his book &quot;West Point&quot; in which he writes a book of true history but presents it within the framework of a fantasy. I loved Dan Brown's book, and Remick's, too. I think all book lovers should read them.
B000000WJK|5.0|On par with albums such as &quot;Definately Maybe&quot; by Oasis and &quot;The Stone Roses&quot; &quot;A Storm in Heaven&quot; is argueably one of the greatest British Rock debuts of all time. Signiature vocals by &quot;Mad&quot; Richard Ashcroft along with the spellbinding ethereal guitar work of Nick McCabe are immediately recognizable. Though less immediate but still innovative, the rhythm section serves as a perfect accompany to the genius of the leading melodies. The music itself is nothing short of a dream. Like the line of graphite blurred slightly across canvas, the music remains finite enough to digest as Rock n Roll yet slides into your eardrums gently enough to fill your mind and body with sweet surrender. Where most bands fail in bringing a feeling of drugged out intoxicated beauty to their music, the verve not only achieve success but a scary sense of perfection. (The music at times gives off an aura that can let a sober listener feel otherwise) The album itself flows very well. Tracks alternate between rockers and dreamers while the mix keeps them constant in sound and feeling. When the listener is just starting to grow agitated and weary from a number of slower songs in a row their hunger is immediately satisfied with a rocker. (Such as the tracks leading up to and including &quot;Blue&quot;) Afterwards it slows down again letting the music breath with its listener. The album winds down with its epic, &quot;Butterfly&quot; and finalized with &quot;See You in the Next One&quot; Though the oddball of the group and arguably the worst track, it seems perfectly appropriate. It brings the listener gently out of a psychadelic journey and lets them return to their normal life.
B000053VAZ|5.0|Johnny's definitly a great silent movie actor.  His Keaton/Chaplin tricks and stunts were priceless!  His eyes are the key to his success in this film.  This is one of those films that didn't get any public reviews, but it's such a light comedy that has a sweet romantic side.
B00008H2LB|4.0|Meteora grew on me very fast but still did not give me the same enjoyment as the group's previous release, Hybrid Theory, did.  While Hybrid focused on providing what the group did best (rock music), this second album tried to experiment with electronica sounds...and failed.  If you make a CD that no one buys, that is the time to change.  IF your first CD sells eight million copies, that doesn't mean you have to change the formula for the second one and try to gain more fans:  Linkin Park needs to realize that it already has a very large fanbase and that if they want their original, and most trusted fans, to stick around, they must learn to give them what they loved.  Meteora is a good album, better than the terrible Reanimation, though didn't have the sound and feel of Hybrid Theory, which I still consider one of the best ten CDs I own.  While Hybrid has so many scratches from over one hundred hours of listening, Meteora is barely hurt, considering it's only been listened to five hours (and I got it the first day it was out so it's more than half a year).  Occasionally, when in serious need of enlightenment, Meteora can help but if you're buying this expecting something similar to Hybrid Theory, you are about to be seriously disappointed.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|One of my favorites, next to only Rumours.  Every song has its own artistic twist.  Lindsey and Stevie are at their best, they sound very comfortable. I have to say honestly, I did not even miss Christine.  Lindsey has more freedom, especially in &quot;Come&quot; (which by the way he did in concert and it was just amazing)Other highlights are of course Peacekeeper, Say You Will,  Illume(dedicated to 9/11 heros) and Everyone Finds Out.  I would recommend this CD to any Mac fan, and anyone who is not one and listens will become a fan.
B00009V8Z9|4.0|Undoubtedly, this is one of the most entertaining CDs I've acquired in a long time.  Degraw's musical style is fresh and unencumbered by bravado or fake glitz.  Something about the combination of his music and voice envelopes you and carries you right into his lyrics...and that's where the trouble lies.  Because most of his message tends to reach to the core of who we are and what we know, one cannot overlook the worn and tired metaphors that litter this otherwise exceptional CD.  Like a previous writer pointed out, we've already heard about a love that \\"fits like a glove.\\"  Additionally, in the first cut, Follow Through, the phrase \\"I haven't felt like this in so many moons...\\" feels like a brick wall just as you begin to settle in and realize that he has put into words your own feelings.<br />Aside from that, though, this is definitely a great CD.  With a little maturity, and maybe a helpful thesaurus, I'm confident Degraw's lyics will soon match his other impressive talents.
B00007E8O5|5.0|What an awesome album!! I normally can't justify giving albums 5 stars... but this one REALLY deserves it.<br />On this release guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Jerry Cantrell moves more in the musical direction of his former band, Alice in Chains. Whereas Boggy Depot was a little more polished as far as production goes, this one returns to the more grungy sound that Alice in Chains made popular with such releases as Dirt and their self-titled album.<br />I was extremely saddened to learn of Layne's passing in spring of '02 and to come to terms with the fact that now another AIC album is completely out of the question. But after hearing DTrip, I have no complaints. Some songs on this release actually send shivers down my spine as Cantrell's vocals are starting to sound more and more like Staley's, like for example, the middle bit of Spiderbite.<br />Important to note, however, is that if you're thinking of picking up this album --- PLEASE do yourself a favour and get this version (volumes 1 &amp; 2 set) and not the single disc version. Although you may think that nearly 2½ hours of haunting guitars and AIC-style fourth-interval harmonies may be a bit too much... IT ISN'T. The extra songs aren't filler or unreleased B-side material. Jerry recorded all of these 25 songs and intended for this to be the normal release. It is worth it for &quot;Feel The Void&quot; alone!
B00004TS0E|2.0|Sometimes I like remakes but this one was so bad. I am 16 years old and was brought up on the orignal black and white version. And that was a great family classic. But this movie was so bad. Why, Why remake a classic !!
B00005JKZV|5.0|Ok, first of all, what's not to love about a movie that stars hotties like Orlando Bloom and Elija Wood. The movie is awesome especially if u have 5.1 surround sound! The first scene is so cool. I found it a lot more entertaining than the last one.
B000002UJQ|5.0|If I didn't love Pink Floyd, This would be the best album I own. Purchased some 4-6 months ago, I listened to it a good 20-40 times. At first it was cool and basically all the same. Then I began to like some little lyrics and melodies here and there. And it wasn't until I bought their newest release &quot;Hail to the Theif&quot;, that I realized that these were stand alone songs that fit together. And after 20 or so times of listening, they got EVEN BETTER, which I have never had happen before. Songs always die for me after I play them to death, but these were resurected better than ever. I still love hearing them. As far as meaning goes, they have little, in my perspective, because I can't really see it (but maybe someday, in which case I will rekindle fire for the music). And &quot;Fitter Happier&quot; does kinda wreck the momentum after &quot;Karma Police&quot;, but you skip it -- and life goes on. I do simply adore &quot;Let Down&quot; as well as others...
B00006F7S4|5.0|I'd never really heard of any of Beck's music until 'Lost Cause' and i was pretty impressed. Now i've listened to the whole of Sea Change, and i must say, i've been quite obsessed with him ever since! I can't stop playing it over, and the songs are so catchy. It's just great. I really can't pick a best song because they're all perfect in their own way. Though the first time i heard 'Guess i'm doing fine' i was blown away and it brought a tear to my eye, as silly as that sounds! I just have to say to anyone reading this: BUY THIS ALBUM! I doubt you'll be disappointed if you do.
0783230893|5.0|I luv friend green tamatos!!!! My favorte movie is Anne Of Green Gables, but now i dunno which one is my favorite!!! I luv umm both!!!! It's a great show 4 kids to see what it was like growing up back then, and how some ppl acted! I will let my kids watch this video over and over! I'm a mother of 4 and they love this one!
B00005OAIE|5.0|Ok, so to get this right out of the way, I'm not into the whole pop-culture thing. I'm an indie rock girl all the way, complete with a band, so when John Mayer was all over pop radio I thought that he was the devil. Then my Mom got his cd and I thought that she was the devil. Then I listened to the cd, and I was back on talking terms, but really took a long time before I completely changed my opinion. Which, i did, by the way. This guy is all over the radio for all the right reasons, which can't be said about a quarter of the airtime right now. He's genuinely good at his intrument, he writes his own stuff, he can sing. Not bad. In fact, good. Now, no big surprise here, but the songs on the radio aren't the best. 'Back to you', 'City Love' and '3x5' are my favorites. so turn off the radio(!) and listen to somehting good.
B00005IC2H|5.0|This is the best cd I have ever heard. Ok, I've heard others, like Dark Side of the Moon, Rubber soul, Circulatory System, etc., but if I'd said &quot;this is ONE of the best cds...&quot; it wouldn't have had the same impact, would it?!<br />No imagery or rethoric beauties could describe the feelings Sigur Ros transmits; because this band is pure feelings (like none I've heard before) and feelings are to be discovered by each listener. <br />No other cd is as personal as this one; THEY make the music, but unlike others, it becomes YOURS: you start linking this tune to that mood to that experience you had when... and so on, until every song, eventough it is spoken in Islandic and lasts 10 minutes, becomes a dream or a memory.<br />No nothing for Sigur Ros, and yet every everything for them. And for you, Heaven.
0800130952|3.0|Matilda is a really fun movie. I'm 23, and still like to watch it. Too bad that it's only full screen. If you have the capabilities, get the region 2 dvd from Europe. It's widescreen (why they didn't do it for the US version, I don't know) so you'll be able to see the whole picture.
B00005JM02|5.0|I saw the movie at the theatre and loved it. I'd put it in the same category as Lilo & Stitch. I enjoyed it so much I told my sister about it, she took the kids out to see it and told me she hated it because there was no songs. I hadn't noticed there were no songs because I enjoyed the movie so much, but my sister, with her kids - definately missed them.
B00009V7RF|5.0|Alright I have to say I've never really got into black eyed peas before I heard this cd, I think it's mostly because I always thought they were just another crap band in the same vein as Baha Men.  Wow, was I ever wrong.  This album is filled with songs that will have you listening over and over again, and the production of each song is so incredible that you can do nothing but listen in awe.  Give the CD a chance, at least a few listens before you judge it because the songs only sound better with time.  Also, don't judge the cd based on the first single, because on the surface 'where is the love' seems to be just another bubblegum pop type song, even though it's actually as well crafted and original as any of the songs on this cd.  This cd is wonderful and I can't do nothing but give it praise.
B00004U45G|5.0|I was lucky enough to see black crowes and jimmy page live at nissan pavillion, and i was completely blown away. They played pretty much only zeppelin songs (a good thing although the black crowes are good too) and the band played the songs perectly. Oh and i assure you jimmy page has not forgotten the ultra-killer zeppelin licks.
B000002OX3|5.0|The Who's 1966 second album, &quot;A Quick One,&quot; is a great Who classic, and the only Who album to feature songwriting contributions from all four band members (which came about due to a publishing deal the band had secured at the time). This remastered edition of &quot;A Quick One&quot; also contains a whopping TEN bonus tracks of various songs the Who also recorded at the time, some previously unreleased. The album also features the band's very first foray into &quot;rock opera&quot; territory, with the brilliant 9-minute mini-opera penned by guitarist Pete Townshend, &quot;A Quick One While He's Away,&quot; about a lonely woman who cheats on her hubby while he's out working, regrets it, confesses her sin, and is forgiven. It's a bonafide Who classic, and a great forerunner for the group's full-on rock operas &quot;Tommy&quot; &amp; &quot;Quadrophenia&quot; that would follow in the years ahead. Other great Who tunes on this album are Townshend's &quot;Run Run Run,&quot; &quot;So Sad About Us,&quot; and &quot;Disguises,&quot; bassist John Entwistle's signature song &quot;Boris The Spider&quot; and the equally great &quot;Whiskey Man&quot; &amp; &quot;Doctor Doctor,&quot; drummer Keith Moon's instrumental big top insanity known as &quot;Cobwebs And Strange&quot; and his fine popper &quot;I Need You&quot; (with both tracks featuring brilliant skin smashing from Keith), and even singer Roger Daltrey contributes a decent little number with &quot;See My Way.&quot; There's also great covers of Martha &amp; The Vandellas' &quot;Heatwave,&quot; the Beach Boys fave &quot;Barbara Ann,&quot; and the &quot;Batman&quot; theme song! And if THAT wasn't enough, there's also an acoustic version of the hit &quot;Happy Jack,&quot; and an alternate version of the Who staple &quot;My Generation,&quot; coupled together with the anthem &quot;Land Of Hope And Glory.&quot; Whew! For the dedicated Who fan, this CD edition of &quot;A Quick One&quot; is a rock 'n' roll feast, and, needless to say, the band totally rock on this one. &quot;A Quick One&quot; is an absolute must-buy Who album.
B000093BDX|5.0|I recently bought the &quot;Hawthorne Blvd&quot; Beach Boys compilation CD. I think I enjoyed that one more than Sounds of Summer. I liked Hawthorne Blvd because it gives you an idea of what went on in the studio - from the very early days and onward. Something like the recent beatles re-issue of different outtakes from some of their songs. I like those kind of compilations because they give you a different view of old favorites.<br />Sounds of Summer will be a great CD to have in my car and listen to crusing up Pacific Coast Highway to County Line!
B00005NC66|4.0|Older movies are like Shakespeare.  They are to be appreciated by all and enjoyed by few.  BREATHLESS, while cutting-edge at the time, plays in today's world like any student film one is likely to see.  This reviewer found the flick very charming and very interesting in a historical context.  I understand, however, how others may find it tedious, boring, and ultimately unfulfilling.<br />I recommend BREATHLESS to anyone interested in film history and/or anyone interested in old film noirs.  The later group will find the european version of the old American crime movies rather interesting.<br />Additionally, if you happen to be a Tarantino fan, check this film out as the grandfather of RESEVOIR and PULP FICTION; it certainly is that.
B000002KHH|5.0|Along with Iron Maiden's &quot;Powerslave&quot;, Metallica's &quot;Kill'em All&quot;, AC/DC's &quot;Jailbreak 74&quot;, and Led Zeppelin's &quot;IV&quot;, this the most complete Hard Rock release of all time. From start to finish this is a classic and also the greatest heavy metal album of all time. Many people erroneously think that Led Zeppelin is the greatest hard rock band of all time (including the lame VH-1 countdown) but it is Black Sabbath. And Black Sabbath's best work is Paranoid. Songs like &quot;Hand Of Doom&quot;, which I believe is one of their most underrated, are textbook examples on how to create a great heavy metal song. That song is also my favorite. And songs such as &quot;Electric Funeral&quot;, &quot;Paranoid&quot;, and &quot;Iron Man&quot; are not only very, very heavy but also melodic at the same time. And that is something that many heavy metal bands throughout history have unable to accomplish. &quot;Planet Caravan&quot; is a haunting number which also serves as an example of the bands musical range. Overall, if you are a casual or beginning listener of hard rock, then I would consider this the supreme example of the genre.
B00005JLTN|5.0|All you people keep [complaning] about the same old things! Well I say that If your to dumb to understand and like The Matrix Reloaded, then I'm at a lost as to figure out how you figured out how to use your computer.<BR> THE MOVIE WAS SPECTACULAR, AND THE DVD IS EVEN BETTER with special features somebody might accually care about. And if you still are to dumb to understand the plot at face value, buy ENTER THE MATRIX, and get some insight. I'm Disgusted that so many people are that dumb.<br /> Just step back and try and see it in a new light, and if you still hate it, your a lost cause.
B000055Y0Y|5.0|Clint Eastwood, in his first film after completing his masterpiece, UNFORGIVEN, chose a winner with Wolfgang Petersen's suspenseful IN THE LINE OF FIRE. As 30-year veteran Secret Service agent Frank Horrigan, Eastwood had the misfortune of protecting President Kennedy, November 22, 1963, and the specter of not reacting quickly enough has never fully left him, through the subsequent years. At the other end of the spectrum is ex-CIA assassin Mitch Leary (brilliantly portrayed by John Malkovich), who had become 'excess baggage' for the intelligence community, due to budget cuts. After surviving a bungled attempt to kill him, Leary decides to vent his rage at his 'betrayal' by assassinating the President. In his research, he discovers that the only agent still active from the 1963 team is Horrigan, and, deciding they shared a kinship, he begins to tease Horrigan with clues about himself, and how he'll kill the President.<br />The film builds up a 'head of steam' from the very first scene, as Horrigan and his partner, Al D'Andrea (Dylan McDermott, long before television stardom in THE PRACTICE) take down a band of counterfeiters, and the edginess never lets up, as Leary, introducing himself as 'Booth', begins his series of fateful calls to Horrigan. Facing mounting opposition from the head of the Presidential Secret Service team (Gary Cole), as well as the White House Chief of Staff (future Senator Fred Dalton Thompson), Horrigan badgers, insults, and belittles everyone's work, knowing the potential assassin will find any crack in the security, and take advantage of it. Only his boss, Sam Campagna (FRAZIER star John Mahoney), his partner, D'Andrea, and fellow agent Lilly Raines (Rene Russo, in another star-making performance), take him seriously, with Raines soon falling in love with the cantankerous agent.<br />The plot is full of twists and turns, as Horrigan barely misses capturing Leary, twice, and Leary, at one point, actually saves Horrigan's life (while ending D'Andrea's). Strung so tightly that he starts making bad 'calls', Horrigan is finally removed from Presidential security...just as Leary is about to make his move...<br />IN THE LINE OF FIRE does for the Secret Service what BACKDRAFT did for firefighters, and television's NYPD BLUE did for policemen; it shows the organization not as a group of faceless supermen, but as dedicated people performing an essential service, protecting the lives of others. As Leary sneers to Horrigan, &quot;I'm the offense, you're the defense,&quot; and that analogue truly describes the difficulty of their job; they must find the means to protect the President against whatever misdeed a perpetrator can concoct. While Clint Eastwood's Horrigan may be far more of a 'lone wolf' than the Agency would, in real life, tolerate, his dedication to his job reflects well on those unique individuals who would 'take a bullet' for the President.<br />It is an excellent suspense film, and a worthy addition to any Clint Eastwood collection!ndrea's).

B0000AOV85|3.0|Dark Side of the Moon is one of the greatest rock albums ever made.It was a major turning point for Pink Floyd, one that would make them international stars to this day, and one that would eventually drift them apart years later.<BR>I am a huge fan of PF, and it is with this subjectivity that I was disappointed with this documentary, the band members discussing the making of the album, through interviews and acoutsic reendition of some of DSOM tracks (Brain Damage and Breath).My problem with this film is the fact that it is too short, and it does have a VH1 feel to it,i.e very interesting to watch on TV, but needed more development for a DVD release.The bonus material was not necessarily 'bonus' as it could have easily been part of the original.I would have loved for this film to be a bonus material in itself for a live concert; that would have been a great addition to the concert, making it a much more complete DVD than this one.<BR>As a fan I would not hesitate to buy this film nevertheless, but for really watching the essence of this great band, you should by all account not miss Live At Pompei,which is the best Floyd film, part documentary with interviews, part especially performed concert.(This film will be released in R2 soon, but no news yet for a R1 release!)<BR>You will still enjoy DSOM DVD,listening to Waters, Gilmour Wright, Mason, and Parsons (a great musician in his own right) talk in '03 about their experiences making this album, but you will not help feeling something missing from it.

B00009UW0N|5.0|You idiots who are complaining about the new color scheme in Halloween,read this from dvdauthority.com<br /><br />Halloween is presented in 2.35:1 anamorphic widescreen. This is a brand new visual treatment and while it is superior to Anchor Bay's previous transfer in some ways, the differences are sure to divide the film's fans. The prior transfer was supervised by director of photography Dean Cundey, who made some changes to the color scheme, in order to more closely represent his own visual inclinations. That meant the visuals were altered from the original theatrical presentation, but the results were splendid. This new treatment restores the theatrical color scheme, which is a move destined to cause some division with Halloween's fanbase. As nice as the new color patterns looked, I have to be a purist and side with the original theatrical visual touches. There is a little more grain this time around, but the compression problems have been cleared up. In the end, I think fans will want this version, if just to have the film as first shown in theaters.<br />  I guess if you don't like the color scheme on the new dvd, you wouldnt of liked the way it looked when it was originally released in theaters.But most of you like the way it was later altered.It wasnt originally meant to be seen that way with the more vibrant blues and oranges.
0446608955|5.0|As a student of a high school with the shallowest boys ever encountered on the face of the earth (and I'm not kidding), I'm really fed up with the typical \\"She's hot, he's hot\\" antics that form the pathetic relationships in our school. This book proved to skeptics like me that there can be such a thing as a guy truly in love (hopefully) and that the opposite sex doesn't just fall for the best looking chick in the room. Boy meets girl, boy turns good, falls in love with good girl, not really a new plot, but very well told. I especially loved the Christmas play (why did they change that in the movie?!?) and the homecoming dance. Nicholas Sparks really knows how to write a wonderful love story (I mean the real love that lasts, not the one-night stand kind) and remains one of my favorite authors. The book is definitely better than the movie, probably because I don't like Shane West, but I don't see why they changed the book plot so much, because they pretty much ruined it.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|I love Animal House and bought this DVD so I could watch Animal House. I did not buy 4 minutes of mandatory advertisements every time I put the disc in. There is no way to skip past them. TO UNIVERSAL: do you think that by making me watch this every time I will be more likely to buy your movies?? Never again will I purchase a DVD from Universal without first finding out if it has advertisements.
B000002UJQ|1.0|This is a very boring record by a very boring band. Radiohead are not good songwriters.  I work at a record store and nobody I work with nor serious music listening customers like Radiohead.  Who likes them? Yuppie music critics who write for corporate mags. and the yuppie college kids. I don't know. Nor do I care. I suggest passing on Radiohead and listening to music that has well crafted songs and exciting to listen to.
B00005JKZV|4.0|Good action,  Its hard to put the books to movie but they are giving it a try. A little hurried / If you have read the books  You would be disppointed But give it a try its worth watching. Only problem and complaint I have is with the music on both dvd's that drowns out the dialog!!!
0767802470|5.0|Those are what make \\"Das Boot\\" so memorable, especially in this directors' cut, which goes further in the physcological and physical strain that was put on the crew of U-96.  Set in 1941 as WWII was heating up, a veteran U-boat captain  takes a new, unexperienced crew out into the treacherous Atlantic to hunt down British warships.  For the first 21 days, they encounter nothing, but writer/director Wolfgang Peterson (whose American films include \\"Air Force One,\\" \\"In the Line of Fire,\\" and the Trojan war epic \\"Troy\\" due out the summer of 2004) uses this time to build strong characters, most of whom are pure seamen at heart, and care little for the ambitions of the Hitler and the Third Reich, fighting only for their country.  That fact is a major part of why \\"Das Boot\\" is so extraordinary (other than the white-knuckled tension that kicks-in when they meet British Warships, another accomplishment to director Peterson).  It shows WWII history from the point of the Germans, who were not all die-hard believers in Hitler and his creed.<br />But once Her Majestys' Navy shows up, \\"Das Boot\\" becomes the precedent for unbearable suspense.  Shooting all the scenes aboard the U-Boat in a cramped, true-to-life replica of the submarines, Director Peterson with hand-held camera crafts the mounting tension with expert timing that produces large jolts of adrenaline.  Towards the end, you find yourself rooting for the U-Boat crew against the Royal Navy amid the crew's tangible fatigue and seemingly impossible obstacles, including a near-suicidal mission when then try to force their way through the Gibraltor Strait, which is an Allied stronghold.  But because of the craftsmanship and talent of Petersen, his actors and technical team, you cannot help help but sympathize and root for the crew.  \\"Das Boot\\" more than earns its continuing reputation as one of the greatest war movies ever made.
0060977493|5.0|This book is heartbreakingly beautiful and remains my favorite read of the past 5 years.  Arundati Roy is a magician.  She created a luminous and fragile world which we view as if through a veil, the sometimes unreliable eyes of children. It is gorgeously written and she is incredibly talented.
0374172897|1.0|When you strip this novel of its artistic pretensions, what it boils down to is an extremely nihilistic view of the world, especially the world of weak minded women.  Virginia Woolf, of the Bloomsbury group sets the tone, with her suicidal, depressed peronality.  Then Clarissa Vaughn, in modern times, is renamed Clarissa Dalloway as an allusion to Mrs. Dalloway by VW, by a young man who will later commit suicide rather than take any more of her solicitous \\"help\\", in giving him a party to celebrate his winning a literary prize.  Another modern woman is \\"so modern\\" that she leaves her loving husband and two children after the birth of her second child (which she did not want).  All of the women are either lesbian or bisexual in deference to Virginia Woolf and her \\"lifestyle\\" and in deference to one of the prevalent notions of our times.  The only realistic statement in the book was when Richard (the son of the woman who abandoned him), tells Clarissa that the only reason he won the literary award is that he has aids.  This book is about living deaths, and suicide of the soul.  If that is your cup of tea; better you than me!  I personally think it appeals to weak minded people, who fall for hype.
B00005K9QP|4.0|What's most amazing about this album--released at the epicenter of the 1960s Pop world--is the raw, naked blues guitar attack. <br />Clapton was at the height of his true blues period, just on the cusp of the psychedelic tricks he would unload on an unsuspecting England with Cream, and Mayall was smart enough to mix the guitar WAY forward. The result is an album of smart licks that are imitated by lesser talents to this very day.<br />The best track is the first, &quot;All Your Love.&quot; Clapton starts off in a pure Blues mode, but slips in some awfully Jazz-like moves. It's fantastic stuff, and no one playing today comes anywhere near the kind of confidence and finesse Clapton displays here.<br />The rest of the band is top flight as well. John McVie was an under-rated bass player his whole career, and Mayall was an adequate harpist and organist...his vocals are always open for debate, though. Seems to me Jack Bruce's vocals on Cream records were very similar to Mayall without the occasional uncomfortable screeching Mayall was known for.
B0000AUHPG|5.0|If there ever was an western opera this is it. In classic Leone fassion no character is truely good, just not as evil as Frank. Our anti hero Harmonica is out for vengence for a wrong that writing about would only detract from the film. Leone's style has been copied many times over but never as good. In this his masterpiece we spend minutes between dialogue which gives us time to take in every inch of the west and the sorted characters that inhabit Leone's films. There are no white hats, no clean shaven hero or classic lady needs saving. It feels as if you can almost smell the dust on the jackets and persperation on the brows. The tempo of the film has peeks but slows to a great build for the finale. Ennio Morricone's score keeps the pace of the film and at times makes my chest swell and heart flutter. I grow sad now with the passing of Charles Bronson. Although he made a career out of Death Wishs in the later years, this film shows how much more he had to offer.
B000066NW0|3.0|People say you either hate her or you love her. Avril Lavigne might [be bad] in reality, but she's ok on the cd. That's all I care about. She has some mad annoying songs, like Sk8er Boi, which is way overrated and way too punk-wannabe. However, there are some nice songs like My World and Complicated. No wonder the Complicated - Techno Remix got into the fifa 2003 soundtrack. The rest of the songs would be good also, if only their lyrics weren't as [bad]and punk oriented.<br />Overall, some good songs, but nothing special. Just some enterainment that some people like to hear now and then.
0385247125|3.0|For die-hard Michael Jackson fans this is without a doubt the number one must have. <BR>I loved it! Even though he dosn't get into detail about alot of well documented rumours and controversies, it is still a good read. <BR>Michael jackson deffinately sugar-coats the majority of issues surrouding the King of Pop. Even though this is supposed to be the tell-all auto-biography the world had been waiting for, it fails to put to rest all the tabloid garbage. He only lightly touches on the 'good stuff'.<br />Overall this book isn't the one you should get if you want to know the truth, but it is worth while. Even if its just for the fact he wrote it himself (sort of).
B00004Z459|3.0|I hate to admit it, but this was my first modern cd that I ever had. My parents were very old-style and didn't let me listen to any \\"modern crap\\" for like 13 years so in the beginning this was something really new and really cool. Besides I didn't hear anything else modern besides this before, so I didn't have anything to compare to.<br />Now that I do I don't like Linkin Park anymore. It's newer albums are sort of cool, but this one, with an exception of a few songs is not so good. But that's just my personal taste. They do have some nice songs like In the End, Crawling, etc. Good start. I think they'll get much better in some time. They got talent.
0385504209|5.0|This book was a truely fantastic read, I wasn't able to put the book down till I actually finished, such is the gripping nature of it. Everything, is in such great detail, and every question that arose in my mind, while reading the book, was answered somewhere later in the text. The cryptic clues are not too obvious either, and the story line isn't predictable, which is the case with some books. I had mant thoughts crossing my mind while reading the text. This I believe is a clear indication that in this book you can maintain an interest, and it makes you keen to keep on reading.<br />All of the escape plans devised by devised by Sophie Neveu and Robert Langdon are pure genius, as was their escape when they were in the hangar just as they'd landed at Biggin Hill. Everytime you expect them to get cornered by the DCPJ, they find some way out!<br />The text also provides a lot of information for the reader which enables them to feel like their actually living the scenes in the book.<br />This is one of those books, that could make a blockbuster film in my opinion!<br />A definite must buy! You won't be able to put it down! Trust me!

B00005JKZV|1.0|This movie was SOOOOOOO Not worth buying, seeing, or renting!!!<BR>The only reason I gave it one star was for the special effects.  They were very well done!  But the movie itself is so far off from the books that I am in doubt as to whether I will even see the third one even at a $1.00 theater!  I know that film makers can't follow the book exactly but they could have at least gotten a few things right.  In the book when Frodo and Sam were caught by the men from Gondor they were released from there.  They never went with them anywhere else.  What is this malarkey about going to see Boromir's father?  And what's this about having to trick the Ents into going to war?  Yes they debated for several days in the book, but never had to be tricked.  <BR>All in all a complete waste of time.  If you really have to see this movie, go rent it from your local grocery store where you can get it for $1.00 for 5 days. I wouldn't spend any more than that.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Starring familiar names such as Ray Liotta and John Cusak, this movie had the feel of a 50's or 60's horror film, meaning that there's murder, but you never see it being committed. It isn't a slasher film by any stretch of the imagination, and that's what I liked about it most.  You spend the entire time trying to figure out, along with the characters onscreen, who it is and why they are being killed.<BR>The basic plot is this....during a severe rainstorm, 10 strangers are brought together at a roadside motel to wait it out.  It's a strange group.....a fading movie star and her limo driver, a Las Vegas call girl, some newlyweds, a family in trouble, and a police officer transporting a killer.  They seem to have nothing in common.  But do they?  One by one, they begin to get killed off and they must figure out the secret that brought them together if they want to survive.  <BR>This movie grabbed me during the first few minutes and kept me guessing throughout.  Though you would think that it would become easier as the group becomes whittled down, it actually becomes harder to know who the killer is.  Everytime I thought I had things figured out, something would happen and I'd change my mind.  Thre were also several times I gasped in surprise, which is rare for me.  I highly recommend this to anyone who likes &quot;old feel&quot; horror movies.

The illustrations are pleasing and detailed, and the little story is fun.  My children always pull it out of the pile and sit together through the whole story, something they won't do with all books.  A great book, highly recommend.

0060512806|5.0|Two notes before you read this review:<br />1) I simply don't give out 5 star reviews often.  If you look at my history, you'll see that.  I feel that far too many Amazon.com reviewers give out 5 star reviews all the time, and once a book is awash in laudatory reviews, it's almost impossible to tell if it's really good, or simply draws a lot of fans to tappity-tap in gushing reviews.  If you see what I mean.<br />2) I love Neal Stephenson.  I would read pretty much anything by him.  I acknowledge that he's put out some stinkers (\\"The Big U,\\" anyone?), but I love his stuff.  If he put out another stinker, I wouldn't be blind to it's stinkiness, but this ain't a stinker.<br />If you're still reading, here's the deal:  this is a wonderful book.  I don't know that I'd stack it on the top of a pile of \\"Great 20th Century Literature,\\" but I'd sure as hell read it again rather than plow through, say, Faulkner.  Some have compared this to \\"Gravity's Rainbow,\\" and while I understand the comparison--Pynchon and Stephenson both have a tendency to \\"riff;\\" sort of the authorial equivalent of Robin Williams going off on a comedy tangent--Stephenson's prose is for me far more accessible.  Perhaps it's an age thing; Stephenson and I are of an age (born rather than coming of age in the 60s).  As some say, perhaps you have to be of that age and a nerd.  I dunno.  But I love his stuff.<br />There's almost too much in this book to discuss, but in short, there are two intertwined stories:  one set in WWII, and involving a literal ship-load of gold; and one set in the 1999 present, and involving a virtual ship-load of gold.  The inter-relationship of the characters is nicely done, if perhaps a bit forced.  The inter-twining of the stories is pretty jarring at first, but one becomes accustomed to it.  And the settings (corporate geekdome during the heyday of the internet boom; various WWII locales) are for me fascinating.  But then I'm a geek who lived through the internet boom, and I'm rivited by WWII.  If you aren't, you should probably give it a pass.<br />Finally, to me the language is a delight.  Does it slow the story down considerably to read a 3 page dissertation on eating Cap'n Crunch?  Or an encounter between a Marine and a bunch of Japanese soldiers in a sushi bar just prior to Pearl Harbor?  Or a comparison on the relative skill and courage required to either pull seriously impacted wisdom teeth vs. take a major relationship risk?  Or read about the formulae required to fairly divide up Granny's valuable antique furniture so as to take into account both its monetary and emotional value?  Hell yes.  But it's damn wonderful all the same.  Not to mention hilarious.<br />If any of this sounds funny, or interesting, or potentially entertaining to you, give it a go; you won't be dissapointed.  If it doesn't, heck, give it a miss; there's plenty of good books out there.  Few as good as this one *for me*, but you're not me, so judge for yourself.vited by WWII.

B000088E6D|5.0|When Frank Sinatra died in 1998 a question was: would the death of the man considered by many to be the 20th century's Greatest Singer signal the end of his kind of music? Would it vanish because there weren't enough people born after his generation to carry on his painstakingly developed style of music?<br />  Now we have the answer: a resounding NO. In recent years, talented non-Sinatra generation singers such as Michael Civeska, Peter Cincotti, Debbie Campbell, Steve Tyrell, kd Lang (especially in her CD with Tony Bennett) ...and now Michael Buble...have proven they learned The Old Master's vocal lessons quite well. His kind of music may be mostly banished from mass entertainment TV and radio airwaves...but it is indeed alive and QUITE well, and called \\"classic pop.\\" It thrives in concerts, some clubs and a host of new CDs.<br />  Enter Buble, a 28-year-old Canadian admittedly (and clearly) heavily influenced by Bobby Darin and, to a lesser degree, by Sinatra. In this, his first highly hyped CD that is coupled with a critically acclaimed concert tour (I have been in several cities where he has been and seen the rave reviews) he shows that he mastered one of Darin's key qualities: the ability to put his own stamp on classic pop music while also drawing on more contemporary tunes and genres.<br />  There isn't a bad song on this CD, although....like with Darin....Buble seems to soar on classic pop songs and not-quite-soar as high on newer ones adapted to his more traditional style. His vocal style is highly pleasing, ranging from soft-romantic, to near-rock, to a virtual phrase-by-phrase duplication of Sinatra, depending on the song. He has a nice voice and knows how to use it. Orchestrations are state-of-the-art, providing a perfect backdrop for each vocal..<br />  Best songs here include a new twist on Peggy Lee's \\"Fever,\\" a rousing Sinatra-style \\"For Once In My Life\\" (sounds in parts like the original arrangement), a superb rendition of Sinatra's \\"The Summer Wind\\" (the arrangement again sounding at times like the original while Buble uses his own style), \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" wonderful renditions of \\"Sway\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" -- and his crowning achievement, a near phrase-by-phrase duplication of Sinatra's \\"Come Fly With Me,\\" which retains every single ounce of youthful pizzazz and optimism that marked Sinatra's original. It concludes with a touching, bittersweet rendition of his vocal idol Darin's &quot;That's All.&quot; Darin must be smiling.<br />  You know Buble is a major talent when his CD's executive producer is the legendary Paul Sands and it's on the Reprise label (founded by Sinatra and later bought by Warner<br /> Bros.). Buble clearly has a huge future ahead of him. He not only has picked up the torch from Sinatra and the ill-fated Darin but he has successfully used some of their techniques<br />in some of the more contemporary songs on this CD. Some of those don't work as well as the classic songs -- but everything here  definitely WORKS. We'll be seeing -- and hearing -- a lot from Buble in the future.Summer Wind\\" (the arrangement again sounding at times like the original while Buble uses his own style), \\"Crazy Little Thing Called Love,\\" wonderful renditions of \\"Sway\\" and \\"The Way You Look Tonight\\" -- and his crowning achievement, a near phrase-by-phrase duplication of Sinatra's \\"Come Fly With Me,\\" which retains every single ounce of youthful pizzazz and optimism that marked Sinatra's original.

B0000029LG|3.0|Firstly this album misses out too much important stuff. I mean where is Dirty Diana and Off the Wall? <BR>The 2nd disc has got too many bad songs. You are not alone and They dont care about us are the best on that.  Childhood is just silly. <BR>I know people think its over the top but I actually like the booklet it gave me half an hour of light entertainment. It takes long enough to get through.<BR>The first cd is the best but most Michael Jackson fans are already going to own those songs.  The 2nd one annoys me.<br />The worst thing about this collection is the version of 'history'. They should have had the dance one from the video its my favourite Michael song. The version of 'history' on here  shouldn't even EXIST
B00005JLTN|5.0|people either love or hate this movie based on wheather or not they actually grasp the whole concept of the plot and understand what is being said and done. for a sequel, it expands the story  and the characters quite nicely. so forget all of those people who are unable to look at the movie as a whole and find minor flaws and faults(the rave scene). its a great movie and exceeds the excellence of the first movie.
B000002U9E|5.0|....that already hasn't been said? This album is one of the best albums ever. That much I can assure anyone. Every song is perfect. Don't expect to understand that on first listen I didnt like any of the songs. It wasn't until I heard the album about 6 times that it began to click. I didn't truly love the album until playing it at least 10 times. Now it is my favourite album ever along with a few other Kate albums. <br />My friends dislike Kate Bush mainly, I guess as I am 17. Maybe they will get it one day? <br />Buy the version with Under the ivy!
B00004X01U|5.0|Far too often people get caught up in the visual aspects of Madonna's genious.  Sure, her longevity in the music business, as well as her fame, are probably both stemmed from the fact that she is constantly reinventing herself.  But what about the music?  Madonna wouldn't be the cultural icon she is without her amazing music.<BR>   &quot;Music&quot; is the perfect example of this.  This showcases Madonna at her best.  With acoustic ballads blended in with strange electronic songs, this is one of Madonna's best.  The song &quot;Gone&quot; is reason enough to get it.  So breathtakingly beautiful.  Buy this album!

DEATH is the greatest death metal band ever and this album proves it! All of their other albums are also extreme pieces of death metal work. I suggest to anyone who loves DEATH, wants to start listening to them, or just loves death metal, to go and pick up this cd. You will not be dissapointed. I know I wasn't.

Every other song is also very creative and well thought out. This is a great Metal cd. I recomend this cd to any metalheads like me!!!

B0000AOV85|5.0|I thought this video was pretty amazing all in all. It's a rare thing to see all 4 members of Pink Floyd talking about their past with such gentleness and good feelings (BTW they are not in the same room together). Kind of makes you hope for a true Floyd reunion. But until then, this video must suffice. What you get is a pretty sweet track by track look into the making of a masterpiece. The weird thing is, they make it look soooo easy. Other than the deletion of 'Any Colour You Like' all the songs are covered in pretty interesting detail. I particularly liked when they discussed HOW they came up with certain songs or parts of melodies, sound effects, etc. Anyways, a must have for Floyd fans......
B000002JAX|4.0|I recently saw Madeleine in NYC and was just mesmerized- I thought her voice was fantastic and her style of performing was simple but bewitching.  I bought her CD afterwards (its a short version not available in stores I think) and was similarly excited.  I had been looking forward to hearing Dreamland for awhile but I have to admit that now that I have, it's just okay in my mind compared to what she is capable of.  No doubt that her voice is wonderful here but I feel the songs chosen and the arrangements for much of the album are not nearly as great as she is capable of.  It's enjoyable to hear but it doesn't stand out in my head.  Your best bet is to see her or get the new one when it comes out.

B00005QG9J|3.0|Well, I'm a huge incubus fan and I've been trying to convince all my punk friends or heavy metal friends to like incubus, but can't seem to pull it off. When I first heard them, it was drive (you couldn't escape it) that was when I was like 11 or something. when my sister got into incubus more, I listened to a few more songs and started to like it, but still only liked mellow music. when I considered incubus my favorite band, I like morning view the most. they're still my favorite band, but Morning View really [stinks] compared to their other two albums (science and make yourself). I mean, they used to be a pretty hard band, with a lot of funk and hip hop influences (especially in everything science and before, including enjoy incubus). There are a few very good Tracks on this cd, my favorites are Echo, Have you ever, Circles, and just a phase. The rest are really trash compared to the lyrical genius of brandon in Science (their best album by far), and the melodic make yourself. Morning View has pretty good lyrics, and decent melodies but nothing compared to the other two. The weakest points are Are you in?, Under my umbrella (the worst song by incubus ever), and warning. I do like wish you were here, but for the most part i don't reach for morning view when I'm want to listen to incubus (which is usually everyday). I wouldn't necessarily call it selling out, but morning view is definitely mroe geared for attracting more people. not many people are going to like science even though it's a masterpiece, but many people will love morning view because it's much more mellow. thats why many people hate incubus and many love them. I suggest you listen to make yourself and sceince and who incubus really are

B00009W0U4|3.0|\\"Irreversible,\\" the new film from French director Gaspar Noe, is a crude revenge fantasy dressed up as an art-house film.  As the movie begins with the ending credits, it tells its sordid story in reverse a la \\"Memento,\\" and the camera jitters during each scene so nervously, you'll be reaching for your Dramamine within just minutes.  Its hero, Marcus (Vincent Cassell), seeks to avenge the savage rape of his girlfriend Alex (the attractive Monica Bellucci), and in so doing, he begins a violent journey that leads him into a sleazy gay club called, of all things, the Rectum.  \\"Irreversible\\" has quickly gotten a reputation for being one of the most visually graphic movies ever made.  Having seen this movie, I can testify that its reputation is well earned.  One scene involves a man getting beaten (literally) to a pulp with a fire extinguisher; the beating is so relentless that it's impossible not to squirm even once.  But the more unsettling scene involves the nine minute rape of Alex, which has to be the most horrific depiction of violence I've ever witnessed on a screen.  While many people reportedly bolted out of theatres during this scene, I saw the whole thing in its entirety.  (Then again, your stomach may be not as strong, so think hard before you see this movie.)  It's a long and agonizing sequence that leaves almost nothing to imagination, and it's at this point where most people stop watching \\"Irreversible.\\"  But while Noe is a talented stylist with the camera, the script has flaws.  Prior to her rape, Alex is not only dressed in a skin-tight dress but also approaches a poorly-lit subway station after dark.  I find it hard to believe that most women in the 21st century would use such incredibly poor judgment.  Also, the film's subplot involving the club carelessly aligns homosexuality with sleazy behaviour.  \\"Irreversible\\" is certainly intriguing, but it's pretty tough for me to recommend as a purchase.  Who would buy this DVD?  Considering its nasty content, this isn't a movie you'll want to watch multiple times.  You won't be scanning back and forth to certain chapters to re-watch \\"favorite\\" scenes.  But if you've got the iron stomach for an ugly thriller done with interesting camerawork, then \\"Irreversible\\" might be worth a look--provided you'll be able to keep both eyes open.this isn't a movie you'll want to watch multiple times.

If your looking for a Dylan album for your collection, get Blonde on Blonde.

There are great rhythms and power, it's a great driving force of blues and rock fused by talented, experemental musicians with top of the line equipment, and if you turn up the volume you feel like you were in the studio. I want more!. Anybody who likes jamming will love this. This CD ROCKS...HARD!
B0000AMRJC|5.0|You cannot come away from this film and not appreciate the fact that Pacino is probably amongst the top five actors in film history. If anyone else was in this role, it might have been just another stereotypical film about a Hispanic drug lord's rise and fall. Pacino however transcends the role he was given, and portrays drug czar, 'Tony Montana,' with a ferocity, and at times, a tenderness seldom seen in film. Don't get me wrong, Tony Montana is at times, brutal, but the film makes clear that he came from brutality, yet he still yearned for the same things we all do, family, career, and success. Some critics scoffed at his accent, but after you get use to it, you'll never notice it, nor the film's near three hour running time. The surrounding cast is top-notch, including a young Michelle Pffeifer, and tv regulars Robert Loggia and Steven Bauer. The is by far Brian DePalma's best film, and what I would deem an essential purchase for everyone looking to create the ultimate dvd film library!

Musically, one can gain an even greater appreciation of one of the greatest musical groups of all time.<br />Gee Whiz...has it already been 30 years...(more than 10 years have got behind ME!)<br />Buy this DVD its worth every penny!
B00005ABX0|3.0|1967'S &quot;Smiley Smile&quot; and 1968's &quot;Wild Honey&quot; marked a considerably interesting time for The Beach Boys, a time when they were considered uncool and not up to date. There are indeed many factors to this subject : Brian Wilson's mental state, an ongoing lawsuit with Capitol Records, and the band's substance abuse which ruined their production capabillities.<br />&quot;Smiley Smile&quot; was released in 1967 with reactions that were mixed at best. The popular fave &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot; is a good song and was a moderate hit single, but this released version lacks the creative vision of the many unreleased versions from the &quot;Smile&quot; sessions. &quot;Vegetables&quot; is probably this album's worst song. Featuring Paul McCartney munching on raw veggies and an unnecessary mid - song spoken part, this song was lucky to see the light of day. &quot;Little Pad&quot;, &quot;Gettin' Hungry&quot;, and &quot;Wind Chimes&quot; are moderate fare at best, but &quot;She's Goin' Bald&quot; and &quot;Whistle In&quot; are just awful. There's a handful of redeeming songs. One of course is &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. This classic piece of music still sounds as fresh and innovative as it did in 1966. &quot;With Me Tonight&quot; is a lovely song with a pretty vocal intro, and the ingenius &quot;Fall Breaks And Back To Winter&quot;  is a wonderful instrumental number. Otherwise, this album isn't worth the full price.<br />1968's &quot;Wild Honey&quot; isn't great, but is a relief of fresh air after the craziness &quot;Smiley Smile&quot;. Essentially a Beach Boys<br />R &amp; B album, this album is upbeat and fun, thanks in part to a mostly laid back recording environment ( Brian's living room studio ). The album's title track is a wild rocker that features one of Carl Wilson's strongest lead vocal performances. Carl is also superb on &quot;Darlin&quot; and his cover of Stevie Wonder's &quot;I Was Made To Love Her&quot;. Perhaps the best track is the chilling &quot;Let The Wind Blow&quot;, featuring a strong lead between Brian and Mike Love and a haunting piano, this one's a keeper. The only bad spot is &quot;Mama Says&quot;, a &quot;Vegetables&quot; - style number that was actually recorded to be part of &quot;Vegetables&quot;. Otherwise, a very nice album.<br />The added tracks are a nice touch. The alternate version of &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot; is a brief peak at what Brian wanted the song to be, with a Western - style section that replaces the last 2 verses that were included on the single version. There is also some stunning &quot;Good Vibrations&quot; outtakes with no vocals. &quot;You're Welcome&quot; is a catchy ditty that was released as the b - side of &quot;Heroes And Villians&quot;. &quot;Their Hearts Were Full Of Spring&quot; is culled from a rehearsal for an unreleased live album known as &quot;Lei'd In Hawaii&quot;. Finally, there's the unreleased &quot;Can't Wait To Long&quot;/&quot;Been Way To Long&quot;, an astonishing piece of music that makes you wonder why it remained unreleased until now.<br />All in all, this a fairly listenable set. Why I don't highly recommend it, it would be a nice addition to your Beach Boys collection.ling &quot;Let The Wind Blow&quot;, featuring a strong lead between Brian and Mike Love and a haunting piano, this one's a keeper.

B00008J4P5|5.0|After De Stijl and White Blood Cells, it seemed like The White Stripes couldn't do better within their restrictions of just voice/guitar/drums/occasional piano. However, whereas those two albums were simply very good, Elephant is perfect in every way. From the wicked (yet overplayed) opener Seven Nation Army to the jokey vocal threesome of Well It's True That We Love One Another, this album is perfect. Not one bad song, not one skippable track. The album is also very varied. From straight up rockers (Black Math, Girl You Have No Faith In Medecine, Hypnotize), to tracks that take the Stripes sound and expand it into something utterly brilliant (Ball and Biscuit, The Hardest Button to Button, I Just Don't Know What to Do With Myself), to the kinder, gentler side of Jack and Meg (You've Got Her in Your Pocket, I Want to Be The Boy to Warm You Mother's Heart, In the Cold Cold Night), this album's got everything. The only way it could be better is if it were longer. Blows away everything the White Stripes (and any other modern band besides Radiohead) have ever done.
0671027344|5.0|I picked up this book after it was recomended to me by one of my sister's college-aged friends and i was not dissapointed. i brought the book to my travel camp so that i could read it on the bus and i just couldn't put it down. my friends had to rip the book out of my hands just to get my attention. by the end of the summer, all 13 of the people in my camp group had read it, including my counsler. all of them put this book on their top ten lists of favorite books. even my best guy friend, who seems to be allergic to any type of books, read the book in one night. it's absolutely brilliant! im sick and tired of the books where either everything is going right, or everything spirals into disaster. this book was an even mix of good and bad events and its so realistc that its scary. if you want to read perhaps one of the best books ever written, pick up this book as soon as you can. you wont be dissapointed. also, keep in mind that this book can get very realistic and graphic at times so it should be only for mature readers.
1400034779|5.0|I had the enormous pleasure of meeting the author when he came to Cambridge - and a more deserving, utterly nice, and hilariously funny person you could not find! He was every bit as funny in real life as his novels are wonderful: and it is great to see positive stories coming out of Africa for a change. My wife and I have not only all his Botswana books but the equally funny new series satirising academic life that he has just completed - all of them are compulsary reading in these troubled times in which  we live. Buy the whole set and enjoy! Christopher Catherwood, author of CHRISTIANS, MUSLIMS AND ISLAMIC RAGE (Zondervan, 2003)
055357342X|5.0|Read this series.  Get &quot;A Game of Thrones&quot;, read it, then get &quot;A Clash of Kings&quot;, read that, then read &quot;A Storm of Swords&quot;, read that, then wait for &quot;A Feast For Crows&quot;.  Read the reviews, ignore the bad ones (they can't understand good books apparantly), then check it out for yourself.  This book series is recommended by other sources like EGM Magazine as the best fantasy series, it is also going to be adapted to the next Dungeons and Dragons D20 system like the &quot;Wheel of Time&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;.  In comparison between this and the aforementioned series', I think it's totally different but also topnotch.  It definitely isn't like a D&amp;D novel either. It is more story driven other than adhering to the magic within the D&amp;D rules, these books have their own original &quot;magic laws&quot;.  <BR>Read it then recommend it to anyone who reads these books.  It is good.
B00000F14B|5.0|IMHO this musical is the best ever. Singing in the Rain was fine for a gymnast and a lip sinked Hollywood sound stage based on acrobatics but Music Man has a story, the best lyrics ever, music to uplift a nation and the funniest comedy ever.<br />West Side Story is totally over rated too. Music Man staring Shirly Jones who is clearly the finest talent that ever gave her life to the art she performs deserves the Congressional Medal of Honor and every other award there is. A damn site more deserving that that Yankee Doodle Dandy getting it from FDR.
B0000584V3|5.0|The first Opeth album I purchased was Blackwater Park. I read many reviews on this band in many magazines, they were being called metals most brilliant band, or the greatest metal band ever, so being a fan of heavy music I deciced to go to the store and purchase this CD. When I got home and listened to the first song I was amazed. <BR> I must say Mikael Akerfedlt, Peter Lindgren, Martin Mendez, and Martin Lopez are brilliant musicians and artists. This CD was flawless, the best CD I ever purchased. Opeth has created a unique style of music, which is far beyond our time. <BR> The only problem with Opeth is the addiction which they cause. I never thought I would love death metal or black metal or the genres which opeth combines, but I think it is all opeth. They are visionaries and each CD leaves you begging for more.
B00005O5CM|5.0|This is the best movie.  All girls should watch it.  It is sooo cool!
B00005AXEL|5.0|Stevie Nicks is truly magical here.<BR>Definitly one of the best albums of all time.
630512762X|4.0|john woo tried to make this top noch movie. but it was not really that great. i saw a lot of film errors. and every time a big action scene was going like the boat exploion you could see that there where stunt men! but the story line was good, and i loved nick cage's gold colt.1911s that he was carrying aroud in the begining of the movie. if i where eport and ropert i would give it a thumbs up!
B000002GQE|5.0|I am in love with The Moody Blues since the beginning and almost all their albums are excellent to great so I always have a problem to choose the best one. I used to choose \\"To Our Children's Children's Children\\", but \\"Days Of Future Passed\\" is close second.<BR>TOCCC is maybe the most consistent with its cosmic feel. On the other hand, DOFP has its big advantages, the moments of greatness and magic even The Moody Blues just could not later repeat. <br />- it is their most experimental and revolutionary album. They incorporated the symphony <BR>orchestra and blended it perfectly with rock. They did it so completely and successfully first time in rock history. The new direction: art. rock was born, and this album stands out as the very first and still maybe the very best in this genre.<br />- Although experimental, it also belongs  to their most accessible and listenable. Although TOCCC maybe flows better together as the whole, the best songs here are just the best songs in rock history, not only the band's best! \\"Night In White Satin\\" is of course their biggest hit, played frequently on radios till today; the rock standard up there with, say,  \\"Stairway To Heaven\\". But it's not even their best here; the whole side two of original album is a treat: Tuesday Afternoon, Evening Time (To Get Away), Sunset, Twilight Time. <br />There are more  problems with side one. While I would not agree with some critics saying it sounds \\"dated\\", based mostly on typical 60's \\"Peak Hour\\", it just does not flow together so well, maybe the songs are a bit too varied here. But taken separately they are all good to great (see later). <BR>(A short comment: I hate the description \\"dated\\"  as the most ridiculous and much too often used here! You could as well say Bach is \\"dated\\" - no one composes this way today! Time changes, and music also changes. 60's music sounds different than 90's music, but this does not affect its values. Good melody is good melody, no matter the style, instruments ortime!<BR>Of course, also popular, just \\"reverse\\" notion that, say, only 60's were good for music, and everything created later is rubbish seems equally ridiculous to me for the same, given above, reasons.)<BR>Back to our reviewed album, I also like its good balance of moods; while it brings, as every MB album, a good deal of melancholy and some sadness, it is also very uplifting and optimistic. It portrays \\"a day of anyone's life\\" perfectly with its changing moods and the beauty of nature that surrounds us. It's like catharsis, I always feel cleansed after hearing it.<BR>Let's talk about the songs:<br />The Day Begins - orchestral intro. The London Festival Orchestra plays the themes appearing later in the songs melted together into one beautiful composition. Graeme Edge brings the fantastic spoken introduction (it's a great piece of moody poetry); it pictures the mystery and confusion of light overcoming darkness: \\"red is grey and yellow white, and we decide which is right and which is an illusion...\\". Dawning is the day... 9/10<br />Dawn (Dawn Is A Feeling) - very Pinderian, slow, melancholic piece. Beautiful melody and this time - optimistic, uplifting words. Recalls the strength and faith we all experience watching the beautiful sunrise... 9/10<br />The Morning - very uplifting, even joyous song of Ray Thomas. Watch the children playing their games in the morning. I love the middle passage, when the main midtempo melody slows down and Ray sings \\"Yesterday's dreams are tomorrow's sighs. Watch children play, they seem so wise....\\" God... Brings shivers down my spine...9/10<br />Lunch Break: Peak Hour - the most criticised song here for its typical 60's feel. I do not fully agree. First of all, the organ layer brings very sinister, dark atmosphere, not quite typical for your standard \\"happy-go-lucky\\" 60's song. The lyrics are also not \\"I love you, you love me\\" pattern; while quick part reflects the senseless \\"rat race\\" of a working day, the slow part brings the message: slow down, don't rush around  \\"It makes me want to run out.  And tell them, they've got time. Take a step back out and look in, I've found out, I've got time...\\"  So, while not a masterpiece, I agree, this is also a part of the day... And a part of the Message. 7/10<br />The Afternoon: Forever Afternoon (Tuesday?) - this song starts the best side 2 of any album in rock history... Uplifting and melancholic, cosmic and mundane... The greatest song on this album and one of the greatest in today's music rock or otherwise. Greatest Hayward 10/10<br />The Afternoon: Time To Get Away - maybe the weakest song on this side but still excellent. While the main melody is absolutely lovely, I dislike the cheesy chorus. And the text seems a bit meaningless compared to the others. 8/10<br />Evening: The Sun Set - beautiful song of Mike Pinder, with his beloved oriental flavour. I love the lyrics; the quietness and mystic of sunset, these mystical pinderian words \\"I can see it all from this great height..\\" Where was he then? 10/10<br />Evening: Twilight Time - another highlight here. Faster, but very melodic rocker, on par with the other moody rocking greats like \\"Story In Your Eyes\\" or \\"Question\\" or \\"The Voice\\". 10/10<br />The Night: Nights In White Satin - what can I say about this song that has not been said? 10/10<br />Late Lament - a coda of Edge. After the album showing \\"a day in one's life\\" it's a poetry about individual dramas \\" Bedsitter people look back and lament, another day's useless energy spent. Impassioned lovers wrestle as one, lonely man cries for love and has none...\\" and finally we come back to the beginning \\" Cold hearted orb that rules the night, removes the colours from our sight. Red is grey...\\" Some call it naive; for me it's an intriguing mood piece. I love it all because I just feel the same! 9/10
0060392584|5.0|It's an awesome book. I've read it two times now, and I'm on my third time through. I can't put it down. I must say that it has definitely changed my life.
0316666343|5.0|I was afraid to read this book at first - as a mother, I thought it might be overwhelmingly sad to read about such a horrible loss.  I decided to take the plunge, however, after reading many glowing reviews, and I was pleasantly surprised to discover how hopeful the book really was.  I have never lost anyone close to me, but if I had, I think I would feel reassured by this novel - the knowledge that my loved one is not so far away and the hope that a lost child could go on to live a child's life in Heaven.  The ending seemed a bit too neat, but all in all a wonderful book and well worth reading.
B0000BWVBD|4.0|I've been collecting comic books since I was eight years old (I'll stop when I die) so I was interested to hear Ang Lee would direct the Hulk movie. Having now seen the film, though there've been many changes made to the character's history, I feel they did a pretty darn good job capturing his essence.<br /><br />First major change, Bruce no longer develops the gamma bomb for the military. I guess the writers thought it would be too difficult to build sympathy for a character who spends his days building bigger and better ways to slaughter thousands of people. Now Bruce's metamorphosis is triggered by a combination of experiments performed on him as a child by his scientist father, and a lab accident. While this may sidestep the whole issue of building sympathy for a weapons designer, we lose that overriding, powerful image of the Hulk being born at the heart of a nuclear bomb blast.<br /><br />In the comics, Bruce's father was even more of a monster than in the movie. Bruce Banner was a seriously abused child - we're talking his entire childhood was a living hell of physical/emotional abuse, and watching the same delivered upon his mother. In the movie, though the father experiments upon his son, and eventually, accidentally kills his wife, versus Bruce's comics father - who beat his wife to death, and it was NOT an accident - he's comparatively decent.<br /><br />Of course, that doesn't make him a nice guy. Nick Nolte was an inspired choice to play the father. Even his good guys are psycho a-holes. Give him a character who's a psycho a-hole to start with and he really goes to town.<br /><br />In the comics, the Hulk is basically an expression of Multiple Personality Disorder, Bruce Banner's rage over what happened to him as a child - repressed his entire life - finally released into the world as a separate personality, a different body, by gamma radiation.<br /><br />An idea put forth in the movie, that to my knowledge has never been used in the comics - and I find this fascinating - is that Bruce feels a JOY, a release when he becomes the Hulk. On some level, this repressed man delights when he's finally able to lash out at a world that's dealt with him so cruelly.<br /><br />Yes, this is a dark movie. Bruce Banner is Marvel Comics' Job. Really, given everything he's been through, he should have committed suicide years ago. The only thing he has going for him - and this is a biggie - he has the love of a good woman. This is his lifeline, what keeps him sane, gives him a reason to go on living. And this was communicated well in the movie.<br /><br />I've been an Eric Bana fan since his amazing performance in Black Hawk Down. Bana was a good choice to play Bruce Banner; he was able to project the sense of Banner's pain. The only gripe I have with Eric as Bruce is that in the scenes where we see him stripped down, this guy does not have the body of a shy, bookish scientist nerd. He has the body of a Delta Force troopie.<br /><br />Jennifer Connelly brought her customary sensitivity and intelligence to her portrayal of Betty Ross. I'm shocked, though, at how thin she looks throughout the film. It's like she's actually been listening to the idiots who've opined, over the years, her bounteous curves made her look overweight (as if!). Watching this movie, I was struck with the urge to take her out to dinner, not out of a desire to get lucky, just to feed her a decent meal.<br /><br />I agree with the statement that Sam Elliot was born to play Thunderbolt Ross.<br /><br />The notion of the Hulk fleeing through the New Mexico desert, being hounded by Thunderbolt Ross, tossing around tanks, etc. had become a cliche' in Marvel Comics before the Sixties were out. I was surprised to see how much power those images, those ideas, had when translated onto the movie screen. During those scenes, I was just sitting there going, \\"Oh my God.\\"<br /><br />The CGI Hulk looked great. I was impressed at how believable he seemed.<br /><br />Really, the only major complaint I have about this movie, that cost it its 5th star, was the frequent use of split-screen technique during many key scenes, especially early on. It's difficult to suspend your disbelief when the director is constantly calling your attention to the fact this is Just a Movie with such flashy techniques. Really, I expected better from Ang Lee.
B00006L9ZT|2.0|I bought this DVD production a few weeks ago and have watched it a few times already. However, I have to say that I'm quite disappointed by it, for the production simply fails to inspire. I enjoy traditional stagings of opera, but the singers here are not well-directed at all. Given that some of the singers aren't very good actors, the result is dramatically very pale indeed.<br />As far as the singing is concerned, not all the singers are up to their task. Some are evidently over-parted while others are already past their prime. The conducting of Levine also leaves much to be desired as there is insufficient foward drive in his musical making. The Met's orchestra performs well.
B00007E8O5|5.0|This album is the best I have ever heard. On their own, many of the songs don't stand up to Alice In Chains songs or even Boggy Depot songs, but as an album nothing beats Degradation Trip (1&2). This is the kind of album that you must listen to several times to really appreciate, much the same way as Alice In Chains (self titled). I'm glad I bought the skimpy version a few months before this came out, because it probably would have been too much to take in all at once. Recall that this is not just some bonus tracks slapped on to try and sell some more units, but this double disc is the way it was supposed to be, but business got in the way of art.<br />Standouts include the kick-in-the-groin opening Psychotic Break, Angel Eyes, Solitude, Hellbound, Pro False Idol, Gone. On Volume 2 my favorites are Castaway, Chemical Tribe, Siddhartha, Anger Rising, Thanks For Trying, and 31/32.<br />My least favorites are 'Owned' and 'She Was My Girl'. When I say least favorite, I mean that in the same way that 10 million dollars is my favorite over 8 million. The most outrageous omissions from the \\"Reader's Digest Version\\" are Pro False Idol, Siddhartha, SOS, Thanks For Trying, and 31/32.<br />For those of you who haven't taken the trip, you are missing an essential listen.
0142001104|5.0|There's just never enough time in the day to get through all the books in that stack beside my bed, but every so often I come across one that moves me so much, that it in turn deserves to be moved to the top of that stack.<br />&quot;The Art of Possibility&quot; by Rosamund Stone Zander and Benjamin Zander is one of those books.<br />This book is part philosophy, part creativity, part business coaching, and part common sense. It shares stories of a world of possibilities if only we shift our focus -- it's not even a BIG shift -- just small things anyone can do to dramatically improve not only their lives, but the lives of those with whom we interact.<br />Each chapter begins with an outline of that section's idea, moves into stories demonstrating that concept from both Rosamund and Benjamin, and then closes with ways to put the concept into action. My favorites so far are &quot;Give Everyone an A&quot;, &quot;Rule #6&quot;, and &quot;BTFI&quot;. My thanks to the Zanders for giving us a book that not only deserves to be at the top of everyone's reading stack, but deserves to be slipped right back into the stack to begin its cycle back to my hands to read again and again.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The Chamber of Secrets picks up nicely where The Sorcerer's Stone left off. The movie is wonderfully true to Rowling's book and is every bit as charming. The second year at Hogwarts brings more adventure and danger to Harry, Hermione and Ron. The characters become ore fleshed out and we learn more of the supporting charaters, Hagrid, Dumbledore, Snape and the Weasleys. The movie should delight any child from 10 and up, but adults should enjoy it equally.
B000002G85|5.0|To be honest, my actual rating for this album is 3 stars.  I mean, who among you would try to tell me that cuts like &quot;Slunky&quot; or &quot;Bad Boy&quot; rate with the weaker tunes on the better Clapton albums?  But I labeled this with 5 stars because of the place is fills in rock history and the development of Clapton's music.  I consider &quot;Blues Power&quot; to be one of the all-time great rock tunes.  &quot;Let It Rain&quot; and &quot;Bottle of Red Wine&quot; are other gems in this set.  I like &quot;After Midnight&quot;, but I like the original by J. J. Cale better.  So I can't realistically give this 5 stars like other classic albums where each and every tune is great, but I'll tack on 2 to the 3 it deserves just beacuse it was a turning point in Eric's career that rang true to me at the time.<br />The sound quality of the CD is not the greatest, even for its era, with easily audible distortion in the loud parts and a fairly flat soundstage.  My old vinyl copy sounds better.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I saw the movie when it first came out and howled.  Even the names and characters have an impact years later.  I got the 20 year anniversary VHS, and now this DVD.  The DVD shows that the movie has lost nothing over the years, and is still a pleasure to watch.  John Belushi, in his first role is magnificent, and his loss to comedy is a great loss.  The copy is crisp and the high brow music perfect.  While some of the special material is a repeat of what was on the 20th anniversary tape, there is a new and hilarious update of 'where are they now'.  This DVD deserves to be in any persons collection of comedy movies.  I only wish there were more special features on this DVD.
B000006MV8|5.0|By the time Badfinger went into the studio to record Straight Up, the band had its act fully together.  There was no attempt to hide the huge Beatles influence - and working with Paul and George, what would one expect?  The big hits were Baby Blue and Day After Day, but the album as a whole is excellent and has a fluidity uncommon to the era.  I wore out three copies of the vinyl back in the day, yet I'm still picking out clues of how some of these tunes were inspired by (or should that be: &quot;derived from&quot;?) Beatles songs.<br />This album has aged well.  The lively spirit of the music still cuts through.  The recording quality is typical of the better Rock recordings of the early '70s (this was released in '72), but don't expect an audiophile masterpiece.  By working with McCartney, Harrison and Rundgren, the group couldn't help but to learn how to record mucic that has the ability to sound up front, dynamic and clear without being overly cluttered.  I personally like some of the alternate cuts better than the originals and find that programming so that I hear no duplication is most satisfying - but that's probably due to hearing the original LP so many times.
B000003S0D|4.0|Fripp claimed at the time that he wanted to make a Beatles like album.  That is, just as you can listen to a Beatles album and get something out of it on the twenty-fourth listen, he wanted to achieve the same with Lizard.  The problem is a Beatles album is accessible on the first listen too, while Lizard certainly is not.  And further, if you listen to this album twenty-four times, you WILL burn out your brain.  It's too complex and clever for it's own good.<br />However, the album does work on many levels.  &quot;Happy Family&quot;, a song about the Beatles, is very catchy.  &quot;Lady of the Dancing Water&quot; is very mellow and quite beautiful.  &quot;Cirkus&quot;, one of my all time favorite Crimso songs, has a disturbing quality akin to the songs on 21st Century Schizoid Man.  And finally, Jon Anderson's contribution to &quot;Prince Rupert Awakes&quot; is gorgeous, comparable in beauty to &quot;Soon&quot; in the &quot;Gates of Delirium&quot; (on Relayer).<br />Be adventurous!  Get this!  You will be rewarded.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I loved this film, as well as the book.  They're different experiences, it doesn't do a whole lot of good to compare the two detail for detail.  That said, director Peter Jackson made some choices I probably wouldn't have - The Elven archers, for instance - but I don't necessarly think those choices were wrong, because those differences make the film experience distinctly different from reading the book.<br />I highly recommend the film, as well as the book.
0679746048|4.0|I found the book to be very well written with concrete detail.  It was very straight-forward without any symbolism, metaphors, etc.  To me, the plainspoken style failed to leave any open space for the reader to imagine and create his/her own themes and interpretations.  Don't get me wrong, the story line is quite intense and very serious, but at least to me, the movie had that slant to it that didn't just give you the facts; it left you guessing and interpreting on your own.  It could be because I fell in love with the movie before I read the book.  Girl, Interrupted is very honest and thought provoking, causing the reader to look inside themselves as well as the common nature of humans.  The characters are round, colorful, and vividly blunt, giving the story its open and upright themes of sanity, human nature, insecurities and fears, as well as the longer journies we all mistakably take in life.
B000002LIX|5.0|When I was an undergrad, I concocted and performed a piano interpretation of &quot;Three Days&quot;.  I'm no singer, but I belted out these lyrics anyway because, for some incredible reason, I felt them.  That's a theme for the whole album--it isn't just heard, it's felt.  I don't have one favorite album but a circle of favorite albums, and this one has led the pack since its release.
B00005JLF5|5.0|...It is a great series though it is somewhat different from the other Trek series. I liked all the characters. I intend to buy the whole DS9 now. Everyone should watch this if he claims to be a true Trek fan. Even non Trek fans will enjoy it as it deals with many present day issues like Terrorism. I recommend it to all.<br />Now about the DVD. The Picture and Sound Quality are great. The only problem I have is with the distribution of Special Features. There are too many Section 31 hidden files which are very small. So it is a nuisance to watch those 2-3 minute clips seperately. Paramount should have integrated these small interviews together. All in all it's a great buy.
0446677450|5.0|Rich Dad Poor Dad takes a view that at first is disturbing, but the key is to look beyond just the words and consider the lesson.  It only takes minutes to realize what is nessasary to be successful and what has been missing from the hard work and effort.  Once I started this book I looked at my situation and everyone elses' around me.  What I noticed was that I am now able to change my path to become financially independant while everyone I observe will continue to think that aquiring liabilities that resemble assets will set them up in the future, and it will, to remain poor.  Don't just look at the little box we're in, look at what UPS truck we are on and where it is headed.
0790736039|4.0|I first saw this movie when I was about 5. I've never been more terrified in my life. I've never liked clowns since...ever. I'm 18 and STILL hate them. This movie is amazing, used to give me night-mares in fact. It's a pretty long movie ( 2 tapes ) but if you watch it from beginning to end, you won't be dissapointed. You'll have your share of jumps and shreaks right up 'till the end. Yes, I agree with others, the ending is a &quot;twist&quot; and dissapointing, but other than that, I highly recomend you see &quot;IT&quot;.
1558908382|3.0|I was told this movie was Lloyd Dobler, of John Hughes' &quot;Say Anything&quot;, ten years later, but it isn't. (That would have been a much better movie.) Instead, a guy flips out at his highschool grad, becomes a contract killer and is approaching fatal burn-out when he has to go to his ten-year reunion while dodging assassins.<br />This is one of those movies which is supposedly about the moral emptiness and disgustingness of a life of violence, but the assassination scenes are the most stylish and exciting scenes. The protagonist even claims that if he comes to you, you must have done something to deserve it (probably). At least in John Woo movies, he makes the point that innocents are hurt in this kind of gunplay.<br />The action scenes are linked together by highschool reunion jokes, and the material seems to be stretched to fill in the time. There's also some elementary screenwriting errors (did they dispose of the basque-whacker's gun or not?) and the writers apparently don't follow Chekov's axiom that if you introduce a loaded gun, it must be used by the end of the scene.<br />John Cusask does a great job with what he's given. He can still do that deeply sincere monologue, as he does a couple of times while still strung out on adrenaline. Imagine Lloyd Dobler coming off a three-day meth session. <br />Minnie Driver, as the girlfriend Cusack's characer dumped ten years ago, is appealing, but she's not sharp or beautiful enough to make her worthy of coming back after ten years. Let's just say she's no Ione Skye.
B00005MP58|5.0|My Opinion!!! I had seen tidbits here and there on the television and finally rented Pride and Prejudice at Blockbuster.  I absolutely loved the movie.  The characters brought you into their world.  I really felt Lizzie's worries about her family and determination for her happiness. I loved this movie so much that I own it now.
B00008EY9G|5.0|This film is a modern day version of &quot;Psycho&quot; but with a major twist. I enjoyed it greatly.<br /> I also want to thank Columbia/Tri-Star pictures for including both a widescreen and full screen version on the same DVD. I love the full screen version. Thank you for conveying the respect for choice.
B000060MMI|5.0|I was introduced to Flogging Molly a couple of years ago when my brother came across the song &quot;Devil's Dance Floor,&quot; which is, of course, on the &quot;Swagger&quot; album. Being obsessed with all things Irish, I absolutely loved the song.<br />Fast-forward to just a few short months ago. I was to leave to study abroad in Ireland for the summer, and, for one reason or another, Flogging Molly came to mind. I picked up this CD at the store before I left and have been listening to it pretty much nonstop since. Every song is absolutely fabulous, but my favorites would have to be &quot;Another Bag of Bricks&quot; and &quot;If I Ever Leave This World Alive.&quot;<br />I still haven't picked up &quot;Swagger&quot; yet, but plan to do that soon. In the meantime, I love to take this CD along with me when I go jogging. I just do NOT want to stop. The driving beat is just what I need.<br />Flogging Molly RULES!!!
B000092ZYX|1.0|I recomend fans listen to the album a bunch of times without regard to radiohead's history, the ... critics, and the views of those around them.  I think they will find that is not technically bad, but it's really not good at all.  It lacks passion.  Passion is easily recognized but hard to define.  Pablo honey had the passion but the wrong direction - yeilding a few good tunes.  The Bends and O.k. computer had the passion and the direction, resulting in brilliance.  They started to lose it during kid A, half of which is brilliant.  Hail to the thief is so damn boring.  One cannot not image them and their producer, engineer, etc, sitting around and feeling confident about this release.  Many will listen and convice themselves that this album is good.  Rember fans, you owe nothing to Radiohead; it's o.k. to say you don't like this album.  Come on, it's o.k., the karma police won't hunt you down.
B00005JLYW|1.0|I was told that the fist Charlie's Angels was a decent if light film to watch and that is why I decided to see the second installment. I realized, that the second movie made after a big success is never as good as the first one ... but even that idea could not have explained how bad this film was.<br /><br />I cannot think of a worst way to spend an evening when you would like to relax and enjoy time with friends. At a certain point, the film became so boring and predictable that I started to look at my watch to see when the torture would end.<br />These girls (I admit, very good looking and sexy) are involved in a mission to save several lives, but the plot is mindless, exaggerated, and all the fighting and kicking seems to be badly copied from The Matrix, in terms of film technology used. The story is silly and goofy, and the film tries to cover that up using too many special effects and sound that is too loud. It's a complete waste if we judge by the big budget this movie had.<br /><br />If you don't want to have a ruined evening, I suggest you stay home and pass your time in a different way.<br /><br />This is a movie that must be missed!
0385512104|4.0|As the parent of a boy with autism I was very interested to read this fun and entertaining novel.  Mark Haddon clearly understands many of the challenges and quirks of the autistic mind and expresses them from a very loving place.  Though my child is quite different in many ways from the narrator of this book, I found interesting similarities and was also able to appreciate some of the frustrations and fears that his parents experienced. Nice to find a book that embraces autism both realistically and humorously.
B00005V3Z4|3.0|After reading some of the reviews, I realized that this movie wasn't as bad as I originally thought.  But still there are some things that need to be said. I believe the directors and writers of this movie intended for it to be complex, but rather than this, they made it an unorganized collection of clips and dialog just to fit into a two hour time limit.  This movie did have amazing if not the greatest inventive plotline I have ever seen, it tackled the most important issues in life and death.  Such as religion and/or non-religion, the human mind, family, and love. But Nothing was portrayed the way it was intended to be portrayed. Many characters including Drew Barrymore?s were underdeveloped, and when events took place in their lives, there was no impact to the viewer because of this.  The impact fulness of every event in this movie is dwindled down to a bead because of the lack of character development.  After watching The Virgin Suicides, I understand that it is the idea of some directors and writers to create a sort of third person view movie, as if a book.  This would have made an excellent book.  It makes the viewer focus more on the moral issues and imagery of the story rather than the characters.  However, it seems the producers wanted to impress completely different groups of audiences, one teenagers, the other, the oddballs of the world.  Due to the lack of structure to the movie, all of us oddballs were disappointed, especially with certain mediocre scenes of some characters (Donnie/sister/friends) using out of place profanity and sexual content, when this time could have been targeted to character development and relationships.  Due to this, I was unable to see the character Donnie as a rare and brilliant person, and rather just an average, mediocre teenager.  This is far from complex and brilliant scenes. The teenage crowd was unimpressed by this sloppy attempt at teenage relation.  Many of the deleted scenes were vital, and needed to be included in the movie in order for the viewer to feel and understand the whole concept of it. But the movie was inventive, and had some note worthy parts to it. Sadly, this was just the stories topics, original they were, but not done justice by the acting and character interaction.  The thing that gave it mystical complex beauty was the music, which sets the viewer off into a journey into the stars.  To anyone, I would suggest buying just the album, which is excellent, the score is the only thing that saved this movie from being mush, and providing it with a certain brilliance I was expecting.  The movie was certainly original, and honestly brilliant in some aspects.  But greatly flawed.
0321146530|5.0|I bought this book for two reasons: it teaches TDD and it's spine has the thickness of a deck of cards.<br />I'll bet the XP adage &quot;testEverythingThatCouldPossiblyBreak&quot; is what prevents most programmers from taking up TDD. Who could blame them? If they truly tested all combinations and permutations they would take years to complete coding assignments and never stay employed.<br />Without being explicit, the author breaks that adage and introduces a practical, simple means for adopting a habit of writing tests first. &quot;Red/Green/Refactor&quot; is the mantra that he shows through the money example, this is the path towards a &quot;Clean Code that Works&quot; objective.<br />Honestly, I never got to parts II and III. Part I: &quot;The Money Example&quot; helped me clear the hurdles of tedium that you imagine in TDD; it alone is worth the price of the book.
B00000J7RZ|1.0|First of all,this ghetto chick is just another britney spears who cant sing and relies only on image to sell records.This chick cant write,produce or sing and is only a puppet of the commercial music industry.All of the lyrics are boring and the music isnt even good when you think about it.She is a terrible role model for her community,as she is saying that all puerto rican women are easy,greedy and self centered.Dont support her music and vote for my review.
B0000640SA|5.0|I'm not going to rehash what other reviewers said -- it's a great movie, period.  The important thing for many is that the plot line CAN be hard to follow.  Some people will get lost along the way.  But it's an incredible story line, very well written, excellent acting.<br />One striking thing about the movie is that Leonard's (the main character's) condition is a mirror of how many people go through life.  Every day is going to be more of the same unless you keep track of where you are and where you want to end up.  I found the movie very inspiring, although in a strange way.
B0000039QA|1.0|this is a terrible cd!, lsiten to TUPAC AKA MAKAVELI instead!!!
B00006BTCA|5.0|Has anyone considered that Interpol, or rather the members of Interpol, were growing up during the 80's, and therefore were influenced by the decade? They did not set out to sound like any specific band from that time. They set out to find their own innovative sound, which they definately did. Everyone has influences, and the fact that people would turn that around and call Interpol &quot;shameless rip-off artists&quot; shows the lack of discernment for good, original music on their part! Even the Beatles had influences, but only an idiot would call them rip-offs! I am not comparing Interpol's sound to the Beatles. Interpol has their own seperate haunting sound unlike any other group that I have ever heard. If the public wants &quot;drivel&quot; they can look elsewhere, because it won't be found in Interpol's &quot;Turn on the Bright Lights.&quot;
B000002J03|5.0|Just look at my name. You can probably already tell that my review might be a liiiiiiitle useless to you, since Led Zeppelin is my number 1 band of all time and I'm going to of course praise whatever they made. But for this album, you can take my opinion. Why? This is my favorite album from my favorite band, and I have a feeling that for a non-fan of Zeppelin, this album would at least mean a little something to them. <br />Whole Lotta Love - 10/10 An FM classic rock radio staple, a groundbreaking metal song, and plenty of experimentation. It could take a bit of listening and getting yourself to get used to middle part (featuring orgasmic wails from Robert Plant), but as you listen to it more and more, you find little details in the song that are utterly amazing, and that ultimately adds up to one amazing song.<br />What is and What Should Never Be - 9/10 A catchy, beautiful chorus and some nice acoustic work. One of the finest moments on the album is when Jimmy Page's guitar jumps from one speaker to the other. <br />The Lemon Song - 10,000/10 This is probably my favorite Zep song, and therefore one of my favorite songs ever. I'd go on forever about this song. It's just... amazing. Listen to it a few times sometime before you die. <br />Thank You - 7/10 Probably the least best song, but very good nontheless. It's only problem that it gets a bit corny at times.<br />Heartbreaker - 11/10 Robert Plant's voice booms, the bassline OWNS, the drums blast. But who are we kidding? Anyone who listens to it knows that Pagey's guitar solo steals the show. <br />Living Loving Maid (She's Just a Woman) - 9/10 Heartbreaker smoothly rolls into this track and the album just keeps going. It's a good, straightforward rock song.<br />Moby Dick - 10/10 You hear it and think \\"Yeah, yeah. Nice guitar riff. This song is alright. I'm feeling it.\\" But then the guitar abruptly stops, and John Bonham drags you into his world. For roughly two minutes, you hear a exhausting drum solo. Too good.<br />Bring it on Home - 9.5/10 This song would be perfect if it weren't for the not-so-perfect beginning (the song has two different stages) The ending is very choice, though.<br />Just take my word for it. Led Zeppelin II is a critically acclaimed classic, and I garuntee you'll love at least one fragment of this album.
B00008J4P5|5.0|While I particularly didn't care much for White Blood Cells (mainly because I had just heard of the White Stripes), Elephant really grew on me during the third listen.  That said, the album doesn't make a significant impact when just breezed through to check for the subject matter and &quot;feel&quot;.  It honestly takes patience to &quot;get into&quot; the album.<br />You can only understand just how intelligent, excellent, and infectious this album is after a few listens.  &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; is ferociously indie, while &quot;There's No Home For You Here, Girl&quot; is very much Queen-ish, but in the same respect very sarcastic and stylish.  &quot;In The Cold, Cold Night&quot; is off-putting due to Meg's vocals, but you'll suddenly find yourself singing along come after you've understood and learned the lyrics.  The rest of the album contains stand-out tracks which you'll soon find irresistable, and thus the feel of it as a whole is very &quot;Southern&quot; and &quot;homey&quot;, making you feel the need to make a call to your mother.<br />The White Stripes deserve five stars for just being as coy about this album as they were creative and intelligent in the complete delivery.  It was not at all a rush job, but rather effectively planned without the strenue of marketing and media circulation.  And the fact that it was recorded with dated materials gives it the feel that such an album with this particular subject matter should have.  It's a breath away from being club music, where the only reverb on the album is in the studio itself.<br />It's not just Jack with some girl named Meg playing drums. It's a devoted duo which makes some of the best music I've heard in what seems like ages.  If you're in the same situation as I am, you'll find this album hard to go a day without.
B00007ELEL|5.0|It may have flopped in the box office, but today it is a cult classic, and a classic among... well... anyone who sees it. The Coen brothers are absolutely genius (even though first impressions would lead you to believe that they are incredibly dull). My favorite thing about their movies is that, unlike your typical comedy, they manage to be sidesplittingly funny, but also have excellent plots as well. &quot;The Big Lebowski&quot; follows Jeff Lebowski, more commonly known as &quot;The Dude&quot;, a pothead who likes to go bowling with his buddies. One day two thugs break into his house and demand the money he owes them, but soon find out they were confusing him with another millionaire Jeff Lebowski. They leave, but not without urinating on the rug that made &quot;the room hang together&quot;. Somehow, The Dude gets involved in delivering ransom money to get back Jeff Lebowski's trophy wife, Bunny, who was kidnapped. With John Goodman playing 'Nam vet Walter hilariously, plenty of swearing, and the use of the word &quot;Dude&quot; that makes you want to use it all the time, The Big Lebowski is definitely worth checking out.
B00006CXSS|5.0|Simply riveting...true heroes.
B00006WUWN|2.0|What is so funny about this movie?Nothing really,except one part in the whole movie.ONE part.And they call this a comedy?Bleh.The movie doesen't even have a decent plot and is kinda boring,and some scenes just seem thrown in there for no reason(like the one with Britney Spears...What was that all about?!).So this is a horrible comedy and it has one of the worst storylines in any movie ever made.I mean the storyline is just so bad its hard to believe how some people actually like this movie.And it didn't even end correctly.The DVD features aren't that great either.Don't think about buying this DVD - rent it if you have to.I don't even reccomend renting it.Just skip this movie.
B0000669JL|5.0|Here is the least expensive trip to Jamaica that anyone can buy. This CD is one of the *best* Caribbean vacations at a low, low price.<br />The music is mellow and breezy ... the lyrics are simple, but profound. This CD encompasses the *best* and most celebrated songs of this world-famous group from the years 1973 to 1980. Bob Marley &amp; the Wailers catapulted reggae music onto the world charts and there it remains for all time. We are richer for this experience. &quot;No woman no cry&quot; and &quot;Three little birds&quot; were played in Nov. 2002 by a Carribean band on the cruise I took to the Western Carribean. They are classics that I have enjoyed from the past and now, *even* more so with the additional memories of my vacation. &quot;Buffalo Soldier&quot; and &quot;I Shot the Sheriff&quot; are classics forever etched in my mind from frequent air-time, when played on the radio during their hey days ... Other favorites are &quot;Get Up Stand Up&quot;, &quot;One Love/People Get Ready&quot; and &quot;Stir It Up&quot;. If you want to feel relaxed, care-free, and mellow buy this CD. &quot;Eiree mon&quot; as they say in Jamaica! Go buy it and enjoy!!! Erika Borsos (erikab93)
B00003CXRM|4.0|I couldn't believe the big stir about this movie, it seemed like everybody was talking about it. I finally jumped on the bandwagon and was not totally disappointed. George Clooney was thoroughly enjoyable as the smooth-talking 'one Ulysses Everett McGill', the leader of the trio of escaped cons seeking treasure. They meet a lot of interesting characters on their journey and there are many laugh-out-loud moments.<br /><br />While I doubt this film has changed my life any, it was a lot of fun to watch - both for the story and the actual images - and the soundtrack was right up my alley.
B00005JKZV|5.0|A most enjoyable adaptation of Tolkien's books. I liked the first film after I initially viewed it at the theater, but after watching it again on DVD I grew to love this film. The Two Towers made me feel the same after viewing it at the theater. I thought it was good, and was just slightly annoyed at a change or two from the original book. I'm not a purist, and after seeing it on DVD for the second time I believe I will come to love this film too. Jackson does such a wonderful job telling this mid-part of the story that I can forgive his deviation from the letter of the book (except maybe Aragorn fall). I still feel that the extended version of this film will be, like the first, a better film. If it is, it will pace itself much better, and flesh out the story to enhance the viewer's movie experience.<BR>I gave the extended edition of Fellowship to a non Tolkien fan friend, and he said he felt a bit cheated that the theater version wasn't as good as what was on the version I had given him.<BR>If you enjoy watching a great film again and again, you'll not be disappointed in this film.
B00008X5J3|2.0|my take on chicago is an extreme one, and i know everyone will say, hey youre stupid, and you dont have \\"CLASS\\" (if you'll excuse the pun) but i will say it anyway because i need to get it out of my system. <BR>     this film creates a stunning visual and musical facade in order to mask the fact that you dont care about the characters because theyre all terrible people, and the one character with a good heart gets viewed as though he is invisible(though in the movie its meant to be funny).<BR>     it then says, hey look at these people. they get what they want through murder, deceit, and lies. isnt that sexy? isnt that attractive? dont you want to be just like them? and hey look at this nice man, he is fat and ugly, lets pretend he doesnt exist and make his life miserable.<BR>     and the media in the film is a direct reflection of the media in real life, covering all the bad news rather than trying to focus on something a little more pleasant or positive.<BR>     since i have seen the nature of some reviews on this website, i ask that please, even if you disagree with my opinion, do not attempt to trash my personality because that is just rude.
B000069HK2|5.0|This is one of the better Cd's in my collection. It's so diverse almost none of the songs are in any way alike. He can sing so high and scream so well, it's a great combination. I like every single song on here and most of the lyrics are very well written. Standouts in my mind are: Maybe Memories, Taste of Ink, Say Days Ago, Box Full of Sharp Objects, Noise and Kisses, On My Own...but they're all amazing songs...it's really hard to just pick out favorites...if you haven't already, pick up this cd i highly recommend it.
B000002GYI|5.0|this is a great cd to buy if your getting into kraftwerk. Its a bit strange at first, but its a great album. the music definetly fits the name. my favorite songs are probably computer love, numbers, and pocket calculator. i dont really know what else to say about, but if you like kraftwerk buy it, its a great album.
B000002L7R|5.0|This is one of Prince's very best...just as good as Purple Rain even if different. At the time it was released it disappointed the mainstream audience that didn't understand that Prince was much more than a mere hits maker. Still i don't understand why it didn't get more recognitions. But i think that nearly 2 decades later any true pop music lover would agree that this is a masterpiece. <BR> Around the world in a day let you hear Prince at his warmest,  happiest and you can feel the inspiration on each of the 9 tracks...Paisley Park is a psychedelic masterpiece, The ladder sounds like Purple Rain going gospel whereas the haunting condition of the heart stands as the album emotional peak. Even an apparent minor track like tambourine sounds refreshing and playful. There is not a weak momement on this album but just great music from start to finish.<BR>Any Beatles fan should check this one out...
0385504209|5.0|I could not put this book down!  It takes everything you historically thought you knew and turns it into something else entirely.  I got the book on a Friday and finished it Sunday and wanted more, more, more!  I found myself searching online for the historical references mentioned, and never before has history intrigued me like this book.  Do yourself a favor - get the book, turn the tv off, grab a cup of coffee and ENJOY.  You'll be so very glad you did!
B0000AOV85|5.0|This is not the live concert of Dark Side of the Moon.  However, I purchased it becuase I think that Dark Side is one of the best recordings ever, I am a huge Pink Floyd fan, and the documentary and making of the album are extremely interesting.  There are several parts that I think are priceless.  One example is the part where they explain how the song &quot;The great gig in the sky&quot; was recorded.  How they hired this jaz singer to improvise over a song that Richard W. had writen on piano.  She went into the studio, did her thing on one take, went out of the recording both saying that she was sorry and disapointed about the way it turned out while all the people present where just spechless because of the brilliant performance they had just witnesed.  There are lots of stories like that on the DVD, sometimes several for each song.  To me that alone is worth my money.  However, there are several acustic performances of some of the songs which a think are fantastic.  On a last note, and to me the icing on the cake was that besides having an excellent sound, the footage is presented in widescreen anamorphic.  Whoever decided the latter has my most sincere gratitude.  I cant believe how some artists, in 2003, are still releasing footage in 4:3 format.  Anyway, great DVD.  I wish they released similar versions for The Wall, Whish You Where Here, and others...<br />PS. We are all still waiting for Pulse on DVD.  Please dont make us wait much longer.  And please, if possible, release it in widescreen.  Thank you.
B0000A129N|2.0|Sorry but that one song is the most UPBEAT song on the album.To my Dismay the Maiden boys have gotten to mellow in there old age,gone are the Galloping Uptempo songs that use to blow me away as a child,gone are the Godly harmonies that once blessed there albums,and gone are the creative lyrics that once graced the pages of the inner sleeves.Its not that it sucks in the sense they can't still play its just they try to hard to acheive things they have'nt tryed to write in about 15 years.Bruce clearly struggles to hit those old octaves he did on Beast,and Piece,but you can clearly tell he's doing just that...(struggling).Nicko does step it up a little from the boringness of the last 3 albums..with more fill's...but still not as much high-hat work as he's widely known for.So basically this album sounds pretty much just like the last 3 albums...even sounds like the X-factor a lot..just with Bruce at the helm singing.So its one of those albums you give a listen to and say ummm im kinda bored now..next track...im still bored..next track..umm ok enough.So not one of the top albums of 2003.Just not enough energy.
014028009X|5.0|I don't believe that this book needs to be introduced. It is, of course, the witty, comic and bestselling confessions of a single, working woman, Bridget Jones, Helen Fielding's goldmine creation.<BR>It is also an entertaining, stylish and very amusing view of modern society, featuring a delicious cast of characters and Helen Fielding's cynical and irresistible writing style.<BR>The diary format of the book makes it fast-paced, and I read both the books in one night each.<BR>Every moment is enjoyable, and I was holding my stomach with laughter during most of it.<br />Bridget Jones is bloody brilliant, if you want to kill yourself laughing and relate to the character's experiences, or simply read a book that refuses to be put down this one's for you!
0783222955|5.0|This 1962 black and white film is based on Harper Lee's Pulitzer Prize-winning book &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot;.  Gregory Peck won an Oscar for his wonderful performance as Atticus Finch, a lawyer in Alabama during the Depression.  Atticus is appointed to defend a black man who is accused of raping a white woman.  Many townspeople try to get Atticus to back out of the trial but his conscience won't let him.  Though Tom Robinson (the accused) is obviously innocent, the outcome of his trail is blatant proof of how prevalent prejudice is at that time.  Mr. Finch's conviction to defend Tom costs him some friendships but gains him respect among the black community and the admiration of his children.  <br />You just cannot go wrong with this movie.  It shows how kids adapt to very serious situations around them but manage to keep the innocence.  Gregory Peck should be a role model for us all.  He shows us to stand true to our convictions no matter how hard that may seem.  Winning the approval of others does not take the place of following what's in your heart.  I give him a standing ovation and 5 stars.
0743216458|5.0|&quot;Band of Brothers&quot; is very well-researched and well-written.  But I'm giving it five stars mainly for the reason that the subject matter is so fascinating and worthy of notice.  Ambrose, as usual, skillfully tells the personal story of those who fought the war in Europe, particularly the members of the 101st Airborne.  It really takes the written word to convey just what these men endured, both in training and in battle, to help achieve victory.  In essence, Ambrose tells the story of ordinary individuals doing extraordinary things.  He consistently tells the reader that these soldiers were pushed beyond the limits of what they thought they could endure.  As such, we learn what these men went through for our country and our freedom.  We also learn that there is something within each of us, something that the men of Easy Company were able to find, that helps us to overcome any trials that come our way.  For this, I thank Stephen Ambrose for writing this book, in addition to his other books.  In fact, I would say that this is a theme in his other books, and not just his World War Two books.  He mentions in &quot;Undaunted Courage&quot; how Lewis and Clark were able to push themselves to the limits of human endurance throughout their trek across North America.  I recommend the HBO mini-series based on &quot;Band of Brothers.&quot;  However, by reading the book first, the reader will have a better understanding of the battles and the individuals who fought in them.
B00005JLXE|2.0|I found this movie to be dark and violent. I don't know if it was the acting or the writing, but it just didn't click with me. The martial arts were impressive, but I've seen more enjoyable movies with moves just as good.<br />The one thing I did like was the use of rain and water to accent the emotions of the two main characters.
B00008EY9G|4.0|\\"Identity\\" is clever, off-the-wall thriller. Plot-wise, it has only one trick up its sleeve, but it's a neat trick that will surprise most people when they see it. Because of this, it's the kind of movie you can ruin for people by giving too much of it away, and I certainly won't do that here. <br />The movie begins with an old cliche. One dark and stormy night, a group of people, most of who don't know each other, find refuge in a run down motel. They are marooned because the rains have flooded the roads. Telephone and radio communications have also been cut off. The group includes a strange man with an injured wife and a creepy young son, a crazy Hollywood star in the company of her chauffeur [John Cusack], a newly married couple and a police detective [Ray Liotta] taking a convicted killer to an appeals hearing. As the night progresses, these people find out they have more in common than they imagine. <br />From the onset, everything seems slightly askew, and everyone seems more than a bit odd. It's like an elongated \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode. About two-thirds of the way, through, a secret is revealed, and it all begins to make a kind of sense. <br />One of the movie's strongest assets is its cast. Besides lead players Cusack, Liotta and Amanda Peet, the performers include such character actor favorites as Alfred Moline, Clea Duvall, John C. McGinley, William Lee Scott, Jake Busey and Pruitt Taylor Vance.
0385504209|3.0|The good news:<br />It is a riveting, fast-paced  thriller, that is hard to put down before one has read it to the end.<br />The bad news:<br />The book is littered with factual faults. This is obvious to anyone having a rudimentary knowledge of: science, religious-history, geography, Paris, Europe, symbolism, computers, architecture, cars, world-history, aviation, banks etc. The author uses widespread name-dropping in every area instead of doing a more thorough research. Two small examples: How do you put a car with a manual transmission in &quot;Park&quot;? It doesn't make sense.  How do you use a computer to calculate a ten digit access code for a bank account? You can't.<br />You have to be narrow-minded to thoroughly enjoy this book.
B00007LTIC|5.0|A criminally overlooked gem, Going for the One contains some of Yes' most beautiful music. Their previous effort, the classic album 'Relayer,' was an experiment in frenzy; lightning fast time signatures and disharmonious aural attacks abounded. Going for the One is strikingly more simple and mellow. There's almost a folk sensibility here, found especially in the heartfelt 'Turn of the Century,' and the ballad &quot;Wonderous Stories.&quot; The album's true masterpiece, however, is the grand and powerful &quot;Awaken.&quot; Beginning with just a piano solo and culminating with soaring guitars, a thundering organ and choir, this is surely one of Yes' most moving and inspiring epics. <br />Newly remastered to breathtaking quality, and with 40 minutes of bonus material, this value priced classic should be a part of every CD collection.
B00005JM1F|5.0|The gradual disappearance of quality non-PC comedies in the last few years has been a downer, but every so often something comes out of nowhere and makes me roll on the floor with laughter - this is Old School, the funniest movie since Road Trip (incidentally made by the same people, too). If Old School was shown to the Taliban, they would put down their weapons and toast to world peace over kegs and strippers. The extras on the DVD are worth it, especially the deleted scene with Vince Vaughn inside the store run by his character, as is the Inside The Actor's Studio Spoof. Walk - no, streak - to your nearest DVD outlet or website and buy this.
B00007LTIB|5.0|There's little point in discussing the music of Relayer and it's importance in prog rock as others have done so at length elsewhere. What's great about this particular release is the beathtaking sound quality and bonus tracks provided by Rhino Records. A vast improvement over the original CD remaster, this is Yes sounding better than ever. Each instrument stands out in the mix, the highs are more crisp and the lows deeper. A great deal of the original tape hiss has also been removed. I heard nuances and layers of sound on this release that I'd never heard before; it was like listening to the album for the first time again.<br />As for the bonus tracks, the single edits of &quot;Soon&quot; and &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; are somewhat superfluous, but the alternate version of Gates of Delerium is quite interesting. I won't give too much away, but I will say it's fascinating how much it varies from the album version.<br />With crystal clear sound and almost 30 minutes of bonus material all at a budget price, this re-issue of one of Yes' classic albums is a great value for any fan of progressive rock music.
B00005ATQC|1.0|Hi,<br />I am a great fan of Kubrick. &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; is one of my favorite movie of all time (I must have seen it ten times). I was most disapppointed however by this movie.<br />Firstly, my main criticism is that the plot is not tight. Any writing manual tells you &quot;if you show a gun in the first act, it must go off by the end of the play.&quot; In this film there are many guns that never go off, scenes or characters that appear but against all expectations do not play any more role in the remainder of the story (like the HIV+ prostitute, or the daughter of the costume shop owner). I appear as if scene were removed from the movie in the last minute.<br />In addition, it is poorly acted. I am no fan of Tom Cruise but the acting of both Tom Cruise and Nicole Kidman was poor which leads me to think that the film was poorly directed. The first half an hour is especially poorly acted.<br />Even the music is nothing to write about. Kubrick made terrific use of music in &quot;A clockwork Orange&quot; or &quot;2001 - A Space Odyssey&quot;. So much so that 15 years after Space Odyssey, the music theme is often still played in the news to represent futurism and space exploration. Music was nothing but mediocre here.<BR> <BR>There is one scene (for those who have seen it, the scene in the house) that stands sharply above the rest and contains some of Kubrick's magic  but overall it is a film to be avoided.
B00008PW2D|2.0|Since season 5 was cut short due to Sarah Jessica Parker's pregancy, I think they should combine season 5 and 6 for one price instead of charging the same thing for only 8 episodes.  I adore Sex and the City and will miss it dearly.  At least I have my DVDs to watch over and over.  I love my \\"girls of summer\\"!!!
B000069HKH|5.0|I don't care what anyone says, while Nebraska and its raw beauty might impress, and Born to Run and Born in the USA continue to set the bar for melodic anthemic rock, this is Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band's best album, bar none.  I'm not saying that my favorite songs are on this album, I'm just saying that this is a complete work of genius.  From jangly pop to grungy crunch to gospel-like hums, this one takes the cake.  Empty Sky, Waiting on a Sunny Day, Lonesome Day, these are all stellar tracks that even non-Springsteen fans can appreciate (I myself don't always like everything Bruce puts out).  And I don't care what other reviewers have said, Let's Be Friends works brilliantly here in a testament to post-Sept 11th America.  Besides, this tune grooves.  It has r&amp;b rhythm.  Perhaps many Springsteen fans--or fans of any music from this American rock genre--don't listen for this, but there is groove to some of these tracks, songs that you can actually dance to.  <br />Only the Boss could put together a collection of tracks like this.  The songs never stoop to the depths of cliche.  Th lyrics and melodies mesh to make for rollercoaster ride that takes you through the darkness of that horrible day, the fear, the danger, the anger, and finally, the healing begins.  These songs get stuck in your head, burn into your soul, and makes you remember that the tragedy of September 11th isn't something that fades with time. For better or worse, it's part of what it means to be American.  Long live the Boss!
B00000ILBK|4.0|Somtimes it feels that the franchise is getting tired. I first detected this with First Contact, although it was fun watching it, but with this film I don't know what they are trying to do. It is a wonderful story about one of man's greatest dreams where the legendary crew of the Enterprise fit beautifully. I think this is thanks to one of the greatest story supervisors Star Trek has ever had: Michael Piller. But then you can feel the touch of Rick Berman where I am sure he suggested and finally decided the movie needed a villan and a voilent ending. The part where Murray's character goes insane and kills admiral Dougherty totally spoils the picture. I always thought that Star Trek wasn't about a bad guy but about humanity's potencial to resolve any problem sensibly. Insurrection gives a very bad name to Star Trek for fans and non-fans, and of course with Nemesis it is impossible to do any worse.
B00005UEAR|1.0|...the single most irritating progressive album I've had the displeasure of hearing. Now before you get in a huff I'll come right out and say that Dream Theater is composed of very skilled musicians. Exceptionally skilled even. I've heard this statement countless times as it seems to be just about the only one I get in response to my negative remarks about DT. Portnoy, great drummer. Petrucci is an amazing guitarist, no question about it. So why exactly can't they forge all of this amazing skill into cohesive and memorable songs? <br />Now in the past they teetered on the edge of meaningless excess and well-crafted songs. The previous album to this Scenes from a Memory does go off the deep end a bit too much for me to really label it as a solid album but it has it's moments and enough of them to warrant the occasional listen. Images and Words is better in this respect and is a strong album start to end <br />This album abandons all sense of restraint. It's as if anyone in the band who previously had spoken up to keep things in check whenever they threatened to go into full-blown Tales From Topographic Oceans mode decided to shut up this time around. The result is a sprawling mess that lacks any direction or focus. Clearly the band is of the mind that instrumental virtuosity alone makes great music. Funny how that could be true if acts such as Ramones, Motorhead, Venom who all were of a simple compositional nature could remain so well known years later while literally hundreds of 70s progressive bands remain forgotten forever. Italian prog band Laser anyone? Didn't think so. <br />I must give credit though for the production of this album. While it's very tame nature tends to drain what little aggression the music might have contained, during the aggressive sections that is, the balance and clarity of each instrument is remarkable and is about as good as can be achieved. A solid production though and vast instrumental skills are no excuse for an utter disregard to crafting songs that mean something and on that count Dream Theater have hit rock bottom here. This album will only appeal to die-hard DT fans, who already own it, or fans of albums that have no structure or purpose but contain plenty of notes, such as the aforementioned Topographic Oceans. Not recommended
6305127638|4.0|Eventhough this movie is one of my least favorites it deserves four stars for bringing a great addition to the colection. We have great TNG moments in it: cameos of loved characters, holodeck magic and one of Starfleets greatest foes. I loved the subplot about the First Contact, it brought a new perpective of the Starfleet culture.<BR>I don't espcially like the new Enterprise, looks too cartoonish next to the refited Enterprise and Enterprise-A. And I didn't like the devellopment of the Borg. I always thought of the Borg as a very misterious civilization, I think that all civilizations depicted in Star Trek express a different side of humanity and the Borg being the darkest one of all. Even so, it is very fun to watch and I definetly recommend it.
078322804X|5.0|The Blues Brothers is a true classic movie, one of the few SNL movies that is actually a good story.  Joliet Jake is recently released from prison and picked up by his brother Elwood.  The two discover that the orphanage they grew up in is going to be sold to the Board of Education unless they can raise $5,000 to give to the State Assesors office.  The Blues Brothers try to get the money by putting their band back together and doing a few gigs.  Along the way, they anger the Illinois State Police, the Illinois Nazi Party, the owner of Bob's Country Bunker, and a band from Nashville, the Good Ole Boys.  This movie is great from beginning to end.  The musical numbers are all great including Jake's revelation in the church, Ray Charles singing Shake Your Tail Feather, Aretha Franklin singing in her soul food diner, the peformance in Bob's Country Bunker, and finally the concert at the end including two of their best songs.  As well, there is action galore from Elwood jumping a bridge with their 1974 Dodge Sedan to their chaotic ride through a crowded mall to the police chase at the end through the streets of Chicago( especially Lower Wacker Drive) and the chase up the staircase to the Assessor's office.  The Blues Brothers has something for everybody and should not be missed.<br />  The Blues Brothers are played to perfection by John Belushi as Jake and Dan Aykroyd as Elwood.  The two actors are hysterical together throughout as they anger just about everybody in the city of Chicago.  There are far too many lines to mention, but it is obvious that they had fun making this movie.  There are plenty of musical cameos also including Cab Calloway, James Brown as a preacher, Aretha Franklin as the owner of a Soul Food diner, Ray Charles as the owner of music store, and John Lee Hooker as a street peformer on Maxwell Street.  The film also stars Carrie Fisher, John Candy, Kathleen Freeman, Henry Gibson, and many more.  Also look out for a very funny cameo by Frank Oz and a short appearance by Steven Spielberg.  Also worth mentioning is the Blues Brothers band including Matt \\"Guitar\\" Murphy, Donald \\"Duck\\" Dunn, Murphy Dunne, \\"Blue Lou\\" Marini, Tom \\"Bones\\" Malone, Steve \\"The Colonel\\" Cropper, Alan Rubin, and Willy \\"Two Bits\\" Hall.  The Collector's Edition DVD offers widescreen presentation, the original theatrical trailer, a making of documentary with interviews with the cast and crew, and footage not seen since the original release in 1980.  This is a great movie that all viewers will find something to like in it.  Do not miss this classic!
B00005JLWN|5.0|When this movie was released it was bashed by critics as a &quot;Matrix rip-off.&quot; After watching the film, you will find that it is nothing like the Matrix.<br />The stories are not similar in the least bit, and the action scenes are quite different. The action in Equilibrium uses no bullet-time, hardly any slow-motion, and is edited using fast cuts. The introduction of the &quot;Gun Kata&quot;(martial arts using guns as extensions of the body) make the scenes fresh and break from the stale &quot;Matrix&quot; formula that has been ripped off countless times in other films.<br />The plot in Equilibrium is simple, and deals with the concept of humanity. After WWIII, the nations agree that human emotion is what causes war, so all emotions and things that may incite them are deemed illegal. A drug called Prozium is used to suppress emotions, and a division called the &quot;Teragrammaton&quot; is created as a policing force, dispatching its &quot;clerics&quot; to eliminate all &quot;offenders&quot; who refuse the Prozium. Christian Bale plays Preston, a cleric who becomes conflicted between his duty and his humanity. The movie grabs pieces from many dystopian classics such as 1984 and Farenheight 451 and pieces them together to form a truly original work. <br />Kurt Wimmer pulled off a miracle, considering he only had a 20 million dollar budget to work with. 20 million is probably how much Keanu's hairdresser got paid for the ridiculously over-budgeted Matrix Reloaded. This movie has far more substance and is a better film than Reloaded...and I was shocked to see Neo's outfit for the sequel. It looks EXACTLY like the Grammaton Cleric suit from Equilibrium. Too bad Preston would beat Neo to a pulp, even if he IS &quot;the one.&quot;
B000099T2L|3.0|I am going to make this short and sweet. First of all, I had NO intention of buying this album. We all like \\"Crazy in Love\\" and \\"Baby Boy\\" is on fire, but my favorite song is #9 - \\"Speechless\\". This song is a masterpiece!!! And it has been on repeat in my car and in my home. This song is just simply breathtaking...It is very sexy and romantic. It leaves me speechless. I was surprised that Beyonce' could sing a song that i would absolutely love because I was not much of a fan.
B00006AFUR|5.0|I heard about 30 Seconds to Mars long before their album was released. I knew that Jared Leto was the lead singer, and him being one of my favorite actors, I became interested. Usually bands with actors in them suck, like Keanu's Dogstar. But 30STM is truly amazing. <br />It's blend of vocals that bring to mind Maynard from A Perfect Circle, synth programming and drumkit, and layered guitar melodies make them truly unique. You really have to listen to the album with headphones on to experience all the sounds that you wouldn't hear otherwise. EVery song is great, but my favorites are \\"Mission\\", \\"Echelon\\" and \\"Buddha for Mary\\"<br />I've seen them in concert 3 times, and they are all great people as well as musicians. I strongly recommend this album. It's a must have. <br />Provehito En Altum.
B000069KGM|5.0|Of course, Chicago has sold untold millions of units over a very long career, but once the former revolutionary wannabes started to develop a taste for gold record paychecks by churning out smooth, altogether awful balad formula pop, it was hard to remember how promising and mind-blowing their first LP was.<br />CTA was a band that emerged with a new slant on underground rock, and the debut LP is still one of the great artifacts of the late 1960s.<br />The band simply set up in the studio and went at it - cutting virtually every cut live. It was a sound that was never again duplicated.<br />The horns were a very different element in the musical mix of the time, especially when compared to the Blood, Sweat &amp; Tears debut with Al Kooper in the lead. This was not jazz, though there were hints of jazz. No, the horns combined with the rock core of the band for a fresh, exciting, and, yes, heavy brew that sounds every bit as good today as it did in 1969.<br />CTA blended pop with the heavy core of an outstanding rhythm section and Terry Kath's guitar mastery. It was a very pleasing and quite satisfying marriage.<br />Only &quot;Free Form Guitar&quot; is disposable, but given the context of the era, it was by no means self-indulgent.<br />A number of cuts were turned into hits singles, after the success of Chicago II, but my favorite cuts are &quot;Introduction&quot;, &quot;South California Purples&quot;, &quot;Poem 58&quot; and &quot;Listen.&quot;<br />CTA, for my money, is still the best Chicago album, though Chicago II is a logical extension of the band at that time, but with a more muddled sound mix.
B00005Y46O|5.0|Of all Free's records, \\"Free Live\\" has the strongest track list, and this expanded edition, which features 15 tracks as opposed to the original LP's eight, is probably the best way to experience the band, as well as being an excellent introduction to Free.<br />Almost all the best songs from Free's first three records are here, and they sound raw and gritty in this live setting. The arrangements are lean and powerful, and Paul Kossoff's sparse, muscular riffs leave plenty of room for drummer Simon Kirke's thumping backbeat to breathe.<br />A great, six-minute rendition of the classic \\"All Right Now\\" opens the set, but almost every song is a highlight, actually, from the slow, bluesy ballad \\"Be My Friend\\" to the superb, swaggering blues-rock of \\"Ride On A Pony\\" and \\"Mr Big\\".<BR>Highly recommended.
B000002N2N|5.0|There was a period of about three years in the 1970s when the humble Ramones were THE most influential band in the world, as well as being the most ignored and villified.<br />Say what? Any Ramones fan knows what I mean. Four punks from Queens emerged from the NYC underground to head a musical revolution that continues to send ripples through the music world even today.<br />Any kid that picks up a cheap, battered guitar and starts thrashing out chords in a basement, garage or bedroom oblivious to how good it actually sounds is a direct descendant of the Ramones - who themselves did the same thing as inspired by countless \\"punk\\" bands that littered the suburban American landscape in the mid- to late-60s.<br />The difference was the Ramones found themselves in the forefront of the music revolution in the 1970s, smashing to bits the overblown, pretentious music that was dominating commercial radio at the time.<br />The first three Ramones albums - Ramones, Rocket to Russia and Leave Home - provided the road map, the inspiration for countless bands to follow.<br />Not surprisingly, England embraced the Ramones far faster than the USA did. \\"It's Alive\\", then, is the perfect document to verify the Ramones' primal greatness.<br />Recorded in London as 1977 turned into 1978, the Brit punks were ready to be blown away and the boys delivered. In a great, tight and sensational warp-speed performance, this was the Ramones proudest hour on vinyl.<br />Interesting that when \\"It's Alive\\" was issued in 1979, it was an import-only double LP. Talk about dense - did the band's American label not realize that this was the vehicle to break the band in their homeland?<br />Not long after this show was in the can, the first signs of trouble surfaced. Tommy exited the drum seat, setting into motion a parade of replacements who were never able to grasp Tommy's simple yet very effective style.<br />The next album - \\"Road to Ruin\\" - was the first sign that the glory days were over. RtoR is not a bad album, by any means. In fact, it's very good ... but the course had been inexorably altered for the worse. Geez, there was even a song with a guitar \\"solo\\".<br />By the time of the Escape from New York tour more than 10 years later, the Ramones were virtually a speed metal band for goodness sake.<br />\\"It's Alive\\" will always be there to remind old and new fans just how wonderful it was to behold the Ramones in all their youthful glory.<br />Hey Ho ... Let's Go.
B000069KE0|5.0|This album, Chicago's second, is easily one of their best (along with CTA, III, Carnegie Hall and V).  Jimmy Pankow's &quot;Ballet for a Girl in Buchanon&quot; is the album's acknowledged masterpiece, which can still be heard in Chicago's live concerts today.  &quot;25 or 6 to 4&quot; is a classic rock guitar classic, with a killer riff and great solos from Terry Kath.  &quot;It Better End Soon&quot; captures the anti-war sentiment that mobilized so many young adults in the late '60s and early '70s &quot;Woodstock&quot; generation -- listening to it and other songs of that time makes you wonder if the youth of today even know the names of our world leaders and how their government policies affect our daily lives.  The &quot;Memories of Love&quot; pieces show off the band's 'classical' tendencies, and the first five tracks show the band continuing to keep their feet grounded in American pop music -- the very music that continues to keep them afloat to this day -- all the while showing off their trademark three-piece horn section.<br />The sound quality of this reissue is only marginally better than previous releases.  You'll have to listen really closely to hear any significant improvements.  So if you're looking to upgrade to a better sounding version, you'll most likely not be overly impressed with this version of the album.  HOWEVER, the 5.1 surround sound DVD-AUDIO edition of this album sounds INCREDIBLE!  The improvement is so significant, you'll never want to listen to the older editions again.  The new mix is clean, crystal clear, like hearing the band play for you in your living room.  If you can find the DVD-Audio edition, don't hesitate to buy it and consider it the definitive edition of this album.  You will not be disappointed!
B000069AUI|5.0|Over the past two years or so, I had been hearing little clips of information or songs about the up and coming Brit band Coldplay. Slightly becoming more popular over the course of that time, I began hearing more and more about them, and after hearing the addictive ballad \\"Yellow\\" off their first album, Parachutes, I decided to really check them out for myself. In the process, I bought their most recent release, A Rush Of Blood To The Head, and was utterly and totally amazed. To start off with, Coldplay's sound is completely original, and the angst and powerful voice of lead singer Chris Martin, along with the fantastic guitar and piano, come together with such passion and conviction that the songs of love found and lost nearly break your heart. Second, the lyrics and tunes of every song off of Rush Of Blood is pure genius. Each song is individually crafted with their own sound, yet flow together with common threads that make the album that more enjoyable. Here are my thoughts on each track:<BR>1. POLITIK- This song is a great opener to the album. Driven by powerful beats and guitars, it is quickly subdued by Chris's amazing voice, in the process creating a hybrid of slow and fast, loud and soft, for a beautiful song. It is also well written, with the chorus \\"Open up your eyes\\" that ties it all together. It is not my favorite song, but it's sure as hell a good one. <BR>2. IN MY PLACE- This has to be one of my favorites, if not my favorite song on the album. It is opened by a killer drum and guitar solo, lead in by Chris's voice harmonized within itself, and also is played with a wide range on intruments, including not only the piano, but a string violin or two. It is well written, well performed, and absolutely breathtaking.<BR>3. GOD PUT A SMILE UPON YOUR FACE- I love this song. Like In My Place, it is led by the guitars and drums, but is more powered by the vocals and lyrics. It has amazing lyrics, and in my personal opinion, one of the best that showcases Coldplay's diversity. <BR>4. THE SCIENTIST- The piano is the main focus of this one, partnered with Chris's painfully beautiful and innocent lyrics and voice. A song of lost love, it is one of the best songs on the album, and is one of the most heartbreaking. The chorus \\"Nobody said it was easy, it's such a shame for us to part\\" is the perfect match for the tune and feel of the song, and the vocals towards the last few seconds almost bring tears to your eyes. <BR>5. CLOCKS- The first single off the album, it is mainly powered and recognized by a beautiful piano solo that makes comebacks periodically through different parts of the song. The mix of guitars, the piano and vocals make for one of the most original and classic songs on Rush Of Blood. <BR>6. DAYLIGHT- This song has one of the best choruses, in the sense of lyrics, vocals, and tunes, off of Rush Of Blood. Not per say one of my favorites, but it really comes together towards about the 2:00 minute mark for a enjoyable piece.<BR>7. GREEN EYES- One of my favorites, this is one of the most romantic and heartbreaking song I've heard in years. Speaking of his true love, never saying her name only referring to her as Green Eyes, his beautiful vocals rawly describe how he feels for her. With only a guitar and a tamborine at his side, the lyrics such as \\"honey you are the rock upon which I stand\\" or \\"You should know that I could never go on without you..\\" are indescribable.<BR>8. WARNING SIGN- Chris's voice is amazing in this song. The guitars and drums once again balance off him perfectly, creating this wonderful harmony that is found almost no where else. Once again the tale of a former lost love, the lyrics \\"Well the truth is...I miss you so..\\" send prickles up your spine. <BR>9. A WHISPER- This is probably my least favorite song on the album. I don't feel that it is up to par with the others, but it still rings true with Chris's vocals and the guitars, although it overpowers the emotional pull of the song.<BR>10. A RUSHOF BLOOD TO THE HEAD- Incredibly chilling, and balanced only by a faint acoustic guitar, the lyrics and Chris's voice are hauntingly real. With lines such as \\"I'm going to buy a gun and start a war...If you can tell me something worth fighting for\\" It is completely mesmerizing. A truly great song. <BR>11. AMSTERDAM- Once again powered by Chris's haunting voice and lyrics, it is a beautifully crafted end to the album. The piano, acoustic guitar, and backup vocals in the background set a wonderful backdrop for a fantastic song. <BR>I would recommend A Rush Of Blood To The Head to anyone as it is one of the most emotion ridden, flawlessly written and performed, beautifully crafted albums of this year, and most likely many years to come. These guys are only getting bigger, and there's no question as to why.
B00005JMD3|3.0|S.W.A.T. is one of those films, that starts off quite badly but ends up being quite entertaining. There isn't any exceptional acting or directing, but there are quite a few interesting elements in the story. The first half of the movie is quite tedious, as all we see is Sam Jackson and Colin Farrell recruiting their potential SWAT team. There aren't any intersting scenes during this half of the movie. If you want to see some interesting recruiting scenes, watch Ocean's Eleven. It is after the SWAT team arrests the villain, and stop him from escaping, is when the real fun starts. A lot of good action and good ideas. Overall quite an entertaining movie, unlike some of the other summer action fare.
B000002KOG|5.0|Though Neil Young has been praised and damned in equal measure over the years for his abrupt changes in musical direction, one thing has always been a given: disrespect for his instrumental work, particularly those signature one-note guitar solos. And yet this, his first solo album, shows the true depth of Neil's guitar work. While some may be impressed with the speed and flash of Eddie Van Halen or Alvin Lee, nowhere has anyone before or since been able to wrench more pain out of his instrument than Neil does in \\"I've Been Waiting For You.\\" This guitar is not gently weeping - it is crying from the pit of its soul. Maybe one of the best solos of all time, and yet universally overlooked. The rest of the album is just as impressive.
B00007GZVR|4.0|What makes Jeff Bridges's &quot;The Dude&quot; endearing is that he has a conscience.  If he was just an unemployed slob and mean-spirited, I would have hated this movie.  But the dude's heart is in the right place.  John Goodman's character was totally obnoxious, always messing everything up for poor dude.<br />I laughed out loud several times, especially when &quot;the dude&quot; runs over to see what Ben Gazzara wrote on his note pad after he answers the phone.<br />I think this is mostly a &quot;guy movie,&quot; but I enjoyed it enough.  I agree with another reviewer that this movie is not for everyone.  Anyone who rates high on the prude scale would not let this stand, man.
B000089RVX|5.0|I love this cd, It's by far one of the best cds I have. The songs are so intence and it's a cd I can listen to over and over agian. I'm looking forward to hearing more from Evanescence in the future.
B000000OAA|5.0|I can't add much to what everyone else says about this fine album. Unbelievably varied with superb musicianship and well recorded without the often overproduced and greatly overdubbed feel that Queen albums so often have. This album is, of course, greatly full of all the studio tricks and additions possible at the time, but it really all works here. Queen were such a very unusual band with their intriguing mixture of old style heavy rock, their eclectic influences and their superb vocal harmonies with Mercury's powerful and at times emotional singing and piano playing. Even a simple ditty like &quot;Dear Friends&quot; assumes a moving quality from Freddie's immaculate delivery - and so very unusual and sentimental for a rock band. This is an album with something for everyone. If you want one Queen album in your collection, I nominate this one.
B0000A7W14|5.0|Even after 10 years, this movie is deep and tells a story that is going on even today.  I wanted to buy this movie on DVD last year but when I read they had a special 10 year anniversary edition coming out this year.  So I waited and was not disappointed.  I loved the special features which included commentary from the entire cast presently as they all reflected and looked back on the film and what it meant to them.  To look at how much these actors/actresses have blown up since this film, it was quite a door opener for everybody.  From ICECUBE, to Cuba Gooding, Jr., Morris Chestnut, Laurence Fishburne, Angela Bassett, Nia Long, Tyra Farrell, and Darius McCreary (played young Ricky, former star of Family Matters, and Kingdom Come fame), and Regina King.  These are now some of the biggest names in Hollywood right now.  It's started a whole generation of urban reality movies (Juice, Menace II Society, Clockers, etc) that was long missing in Hollywood or just totally ignored by the establishment.  It should be just as important a black film in the 90's as Spike Lee's Do The Right was in the 80's.  Even looking at it now, I enjoy it just as much as when it came out.  Two things I was kind of dissapointed about with this special edition DVD was that it only had two deleted scenes and when they interviewed the guys who played Doughboy, Tre, and Ricky as kids, they never interviewed the guy that played Doughboy.  However minor, it's still a 5 star classic in my book.
B0000AOV85|5.0|The Dark Side of the Moon tour began in March 1973. [...] has a listing of Pink Floyd concert sites. The early Winterland shows were Oct/Nov 1967, Oct 15,1971 for Meddle and Sept 24,72.<BR>Anyway, Dark Side of the Moon is still great and this documentary gives great background on the production of this historic album. I recommend it if your into Pink Floyd history.
B00005JLEU|5.0|There is so much that could be said about Hayao Miyazaki's incredible tale of a little girl lost in a new world, it's difficult to even know where to begin. Since others have already said so much, I'll try to keep it short.<br />&quot;Spirited Away&quot; has all the ingredients of a classic fairy tale, but told using a modern medium. In just over two hours, it accomplishes the admirable goal of establishing a new world, one experienced for the first time by the young human girl Chihiro, later called Sen. As first her parents are changed, so Chihiro changes as she learns how best to adapt to this new environment, though Chihiro is changed in far more subtle (and perhaps more permanent) ways.<br />Comparisons to L. Frank Baum's &quot;Oz&quot; series, or perhaps even more, Lewis Carroll's &quot;Alice&quot; books, are entirely apt. &quot;Spirited Away&quot; shares the best elements of those classic stories: frightening situations, mysterious characters, a sense of humor, and an unquenchable sense of wonder and magic. As Chihiro adapts to and comes to terms with this strange new place and the new people she has to interact with, we are given a rare treat... a glimpse into something we've never seen before, through the eyes and sensibilities of a child.<br />The DVD presentation is even better than expected, with excellent image and sound reproduction. What's more, the second DVD includes extras that are actually worth watching. In particular, the Nippon TV special includes some enticing segments showing Miyazaki working on &quot;Spirited Away,&quot; conveying his ideas to the rest of those working on the film. The DVD is well worth watching more than once, and will be a happy addition to my small (but growing) collection.<br />What's best about the DVD, however, is unquestionably the film itself. Steeped in Japanese culture and mythology, and yet universal in its themes, it is a film which is worthy of the best tales we pass down to our children, and to our children's children. The story is unique, and yet it should have meaning for anyone who sees it, particularly those who remember with fondness the rare magic that a good story can weave. This story weaves the best sort of magic imaginable.ildren.

0380018179|5.0|Read this book and buy the Movie (I got it new for $16). Greatest love story ever. Makes Gone With The Wind look like Pee Wee Herman. This should be a must see for every one. Shows what true love can be, although it is heartbreaking. Hard to get it out of your mind. The young Meggie is spectacular (played by Sydney Penny). I put this book up there with Roots and A Walk across America). Buy it, read it, watch it.

B000002UDB|2.0|This CD falls a little short of what I expected, as songs like Flying, Blue Jay Way, Your Mother Should Know, and the Fool on the Hill are simply not up to the standard Beatle quality. <br />Penny Lane and Strawberry Fields are good, but those can be bought on some of the hits compilations like Past Masters or 1967-1970. <br />I give one star each for the hits, but that's it.
0156027321|2.0|I had high expectations prior to reading this book, but was incredibly disappointed. 'Life of Pi' was certainly well-written, and based on an interesting story. However, I found neither the journey nor the conclusion reached by this book to be the slightest bit compelling. I did not find this book entertaining or amusing, although I was frequently nauseated by some of the descriptions of events on the boat.<br />My opinion appears to be the exception to the popular viewpoint. It is great that this book has achieved such a high level of success. However, I do not think it is for everyone.

B00008PW3Q|5.0|I LOVE Fleetwood Mac. They (along with Fanny) have been my favorite band for over 25 years now. That's why I feel so comfortable voicing my thoughts, both positive and negative, on their latest release, SAY YOU WILL. First off, Christine McVie is definitely missed. Her velvety warm vocals and sweet lyrics always perfectly offset Lindsey Buckingham's more self-indulgent moments and Stevie Nicks' more eccentric ones. That balance is sorely missing on SAY YOU WILL. Second, around five or six songs could have been cut from the final track listing, turning a very good album into a great, extra tight, one. And don't get me wrong....SAY YOU WILL is a VERY good album, but it's a good album that eventually buckles under the weight of it's own volume. This overabundance of riches also underscores and highlights the fact that SYW actually started out as a completed Buckingham solo disc (the aborted GIFT OF SCREWS), with a number of tracks being removed and replaced by Nicks compositions. When judging SYW on it's own merits, I found it best to break the CD into three groups, sort of a the Good, the Bad and the Ugly or, in this case, the Classic, the Good and the Disposable. Due to space constraints (and the fact that I want to concentrate on the disc's pluses!), I'll just say the Disposable cuts (for me!) that I would have dropped are &quot;Red Rover&quot;, &quot;Illume 9/11&quot;, &quot;Say Goodbye&quot;, &quot;Smile At You&quot;, &quot;Running Through The Garden&quot; and, especially, &quot;Come&quot; (don't EVEN get me started on this one!). So let's start with the Good batch. &quot;Murrow Turning Over In His Grave&quot; is Buckingham at his best, innovative without being over the top. With it's upper register vocal and plunking guitars, this track alone proves Fleetwood Mac is just as relevant in 2003 as they were in 1977. The only thing that could have improved this killer track would have been replacing the guitar blast ending with a more creative, toned-down one, akin to the one Buckingham laid down on Kim Carnes' &quot;Begging For Favors.&quot; &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; is classic Fleetwood Mac (I particularly like Nicks' whispered &quot;Leaves a trace&quot;), while &quot;Silver Girl&quot; is a thoughtful tribute to Sheryl Crow (&quot;She would have preferred/The last generation/But that's all right/She's on her way&quot;). &quot;Steal Your Heart Away&quot; is one of Buckingham's most gorgeous compositions, but I do prefer the original version slated for GIFT OF SCREWS. That version was blessed simply by Christine McVie's clear, clean harmony vocal, while SAY YOU WILL's version is a tad bit too...busy. &quot;Bleed To Love Her&quot; builds on the promise shown on THE DANCE's live version, while &quot;Destiny Rules&quot; has a dark, forboding quality that is simply mesmerizing. And now for the Classic material...those six songs that would fit perfectly on any Fleetwood Mac album. SAY YOU WILL opens with the lilting &quot;What's The World Coming To.&quot; With it's soaring chorus and knowing lyrics (&quot;I can jump right off fall right into the ocean/I can come right out mean just what I say/But if I don't call for a reservation/They'll just turn me down turn me inside out&quot;), the track instantly confirms the fact that Fleetwood Mac is anything but past their prime. This is also the case with &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, a Nicks composition of exceptional grace and haunting beauty: &quot;Faith is a hard thing/To hold on to/Something inside you says/I don't have to/You're not like other people/You do what you want to.&quot; If there were any justice in the world, this would be the next single....and it would be a huge hit! &quot;Miranda&quot; has an almost subversive quality to it, and it's amazing how well it works....Buckingham sounds eerie, Nicks comes across as hypnotic, and it all comes together in a pulsing mix, with masterful guitar work and an in-your-face chorus. I don't know why the disc's title track wasn't a bigger hit...&quot;Say You Will&quot; certainly isn't deep, but it's a classic love song that finds Nicks in top form. The vocals just melt out of your speakers, while the lyrics are some of the most honest, down-to-earth Nicks has ever written (&quot;Something in you/Brought out something in me/That I've never been since/That part of me that was only for you/That kind of romance&quot; and &quot;That kind of touch, electricity of love/That certain kind of grace/That you love because you become/Someone else/In an instant&quot;). Brilliant! Speaking of great singles, Reprise would be wise to release a remixed &quot;Everybody Finds Out&quot; to the clubs....this song has dance hit written all over it (Hey, if Nicks can hit #1 on the Dance charts with &quot;Planets Of The Universe...!). SAY YOU WILL wraps up with the delicate &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot;, one of Nicks' most beautiful songs ever. Her hushed lead vocal is both breathtaking and heartbreaking, and ranks as one of her two or three all-time best. A true masterpiece! So...while I think the true test will be the next Fleetwood Mac album, where the group works together from day one versus piecing together various solo projects, SAY YOU WILL is a strong enough addition to the Fleetwood Mac catalog to keep the doubters and nay-sayers quiet for some time to come.uot;Say You Will&quot; certainly isn't deep, but it's a classic love song that finds Nicks in top form.

B000002UAU|2.0|No, not the album - which is fair, but the herd of biased and unthinking reviewers that will give any Beatle album 5-stars, despite the fact they contain songs like Within You Without You, or Mr. Kite.  Simply hilarious!<br />As for Sgt. Pepper, A Day in the Like is a classic, but it alone isn't worth 5-stars.<br />2-stars.
0385503954|3.0|There are some very odd things about this interesting book.  We don't really have a protagonist that you can identify with.  What we have is an immature young girl who unintentionally &quot;bears false witness&quot;, incriminating an innocent man and sending him to jail.  Because of this, it is a dark book.  There are no heroes.  Just a big OH NOOOOOOOOOOOOO.<br />Another oddity of the book is that we are given two completely different endings, which reminds me of Life Of Pi.  First we get the ending that we are prepared to accept.  Then in a sort of afterward, we are told that the ending we just read is not the real one, and that the real one is in fact much worse, much less satisfactory.<br />As I said before, this is an interesting book.  But it is also an exercise in banging your head against the wall.
0688163173|4.0|This book  - Shutter Island - was riveting from beginning to end.<br />I happen to like Dennis Lehane's dark \\"take\\" on reality.  He is brilliantly adept at creating complex and humorous characters.<br />This book hooked me in from the beginning and kept me interested - actually obsesed.  I couldn't put it down!<br />It had one slight problem:  the ending!  What happened?  I loved the book but I felt so let down by not getting what he was getting at!  Can someone help?  Thanks!

B00005JL95|2.0|to get straight to the point i really dislike this movie the lesseon it teaches is boring and besides, the movie isnt all that moving and uplifting.i think disney could have thought of something better.
B00008OWZC|4.0|My hobby is listening to the latest release from \\"big name\\" rockers (old and new) and see if they can still put out a great album. Not just a few good songs with a bunch of filler, but a \\"$$$ well spent\\" kind of album. Well, LZ's How The West Was Won is really, really impressive, but it's still no MADE IN JAPAN via DEEP PURPLE! <br />Best tracks: Well...all of it!<br />P.S. Speaking of DEEP PURPLE, I was lucky enough to hear an advanced copy of their new album (available Oct. 7th here in the States) and it's truly AMAZING! <BR>With a title like BANANAS, I was ready to hit the skip button aplenty. Guess what?...<BR>I never did. I found myself blown away. It's simply a case of a band being recorded in the right place, at the right time and with the right (amount of) songs. It's rockin, bluesy, soulful, melodic, and powerful.... encompassing the very best that Hard Rock music has to offer. I've played it a dozen times now and it has real depth that keeps me coming back for more. Check out all the 5 star reviews of BANANAS on UK Amazon. <BR>BRAVO DEEP PURPLE! Thank God this band reunited!

0783230621|5.0|I saw this movie on tv, although I remember mom and dad rented it once, I saw like the second half. I feel like it was a fun rental, didn't remember much except different scenes, and by far the special effects are great.<br />There aren't alot of volcano movies, there's that one with that guy, and the lava is coming, so they build a ditch. I don't have a clue, sylvester stalloyn or something, I don't know who it was. I honestly liked this movie though. Don't think it tried too hard to be the smash hit of all time, but was good. Linda Hamiliton was in my favorite movie of all time, T2. Pierce Brosdon or whatever was in Golden-eye which was alright. I feel his later bonds are quite boring compared to Golden-eye or whatever, but hes cool in this. The lava is crazy cool, a bit boring at times when we think there is nothing wrong, then there is an explosion and the whole place is burnt to the ground. I loved the smoke from the volcano when you first see it. And the big smoke cloud chasing them looks cool from far away.<br />I enjoyed the movie though. Good to just not think about anything except escaping that lava. Relaxing, action movie. There aren't alot of action movies that rock anymore, I mean when was the last time you saw a cool movie about natural disasters.<br />Go rent the movie, I wouldn't reccomend buying it, but I think it is fun enough to rent.
B0000A9GLS|4.0|When flash flooding caused by heavy rains makes nearby roads impassible, 10 people are stranded at a roadside motel somewhere in the American West: a middle-aged couple with a young child (John C. McGinley & Leila Kenzle), a prostitute named Paris on her way to a better life in Florida (Amanda Peet), an aging irascible actress (Rebecca DeMornay) and her driver, Edward (John Cusack), a police officer (Ray Liotta) who is transporting a prisoner, a recently married young couple (Clea DuVall & William Scott Lee), and the motel's manager, Larry (John Hawkes). One by one, the stranded motorists are murdered. Edward and the police officer take it upon themselves to keep the motel's occupants safe and to find the killer, whom they immediately suspect to be the police officer's escaped prisoner. But even confining the guests to one room where they can observe one another doesn't slow the killer's progress, and panic ensues.<br /><br />&#34;Identity&#34; is a thoroughly enjoyable suspense film that is truly worthy of the &#34;suspense&#34; genre. It's a slasher movie of sorts, with one gruesome murder after another. But the mystery of the killer's identity is emphasized over the gore. And the killer's identity truly is a mystery. Michael Cooney's clever screenplay and director James Mangold's adept direction give the audience more information than the characters have, so we believe that we may know who the killer is. This increases the audience's investment in the story and helps create suspense. But it turns out that we have incomplete information, as well, which leaves the audience to be surprised but satisfied when the killer's identity is revealed. The film's only real flaw is that we never understand exactly what happened at the motel. I found the difficulty in separating fact from fantasy when all is said and done to be frustrating. This didn't actually detract from my enjoyment of the film until the very end, though. Everyone loves a murder mystery, so I think that &#34;Identity&#34; will appeal to a wide audience -although not a squeamish audience.&#34; will appeal to a wide audience -although not a squeamish audience.

0312954468|5.0|This novel is perfect for those who like `Gone With the Wind' epics.  There is a cast of hundreds, a larger-than-life hero and heroine, and a narrator who adds a bit of narcissistic comic relief.  The plot involves the love of Tanus, a noble of ancient Egypt (the date is c. 1780 BCE) for Lostris, the daughter of Lord Intef (the main villain).  Lord Intef ruined Tanus' father secretly, and only the narrator, Taita the slave, knows the true story of Lord Harrab's disgrace and his son's inability to marry Lostris.  When Lostris is married to the weak Pharaoh Mamose, it seems as if the lover's will never be together.  Enlisting Taita's help (as a eunuch, he is no threat to Lostris and is her personal slave), true love does triumph; however, it is bittersweet.  This is not the only plotline, however: there is everything from desert bandits, to the conquest (briefly) of Egypt by the Hyksos, to the removal of the Egyptian royal court into Ethiopia.  Through all these events, Taita provides his very unique opinions on everything from a slave owning society (a necessity that's `natural' to him, even though he is a slave), to his many inventions (he claims to have invented or perfected grandstands, brain surgery, and chariots, amongst other things), to his many investments in `river front property'.  Some of the events are quite gruesome - such as when Intef finally gets his just desserts - but the dramatic story holds up, no matter how fantastic the events become.  Smith has really created a modern classic with this novel, which combines good history with good storytelling.
B00008H2LB|5.0|Meteora is not Hybrid Theory Part II. Sure the sound is similar but that's only because Linkin Park chose to remain true to a sound that they've made uniquely their own. Honestly, how many bands completely redefine their sound for every album they come out with. In it's own right, Meteora is a great album that has received mixed reviews only because of comparisons to HT. Although lyrically, it does pale in comparison to HT, sonically Meteora has achieved a maturity in it's blending of the rap with the melodic and it's experimentation with new sounds for the samples. Overall, when you listen to the album as a whole, it has a completely different feel to it. <br />Here's my breakdown of the tracks. . . <BR>1) Foreword: New from anything in HT. Blends seamlessly into the first song. Great intro to the album. <br />2) Don't Stay: Has been compared to One Step Closer. Has similar song structure but otherwise different. Very heavy song. Good energetic start but not the best song on the album. (6/10)<br />3) Somewhere I Belong: The first single. Has been compared to In The End. Again similar structure but different. The introduction to this song alone earns it a (9/10). Amazing. <br />4) Lying from You: The exchange between the rapping and the singing in this song is exceptional. It's not at all formulaic and the best we've heard thus far. The guitar riff for the chorus is great. One of my favorites. (10/10)<br />5) Hit the Floor: New hip hop sound for the band. Shinoda experimentation in sing-song rapping style was a success. The screaming part was Chester at his best and it kept the song from being too hip hop. The song has a very edgy feel to it. (10/10) <br />6) Easier to Run: The layering of the rapping with the singing was great in this song. Catchy chorus. (8/10)<br />7) Faint: Second Single. This is unlike anything they've done before in the past. The drums on this song were amazing. Rapping is fast paced and infectious. Screaming is one of the best. (10/10)<br />8) Figure .09: The chorus for the song catchy. OK song but doesn't really stand out. (7/10)<br />9) Breaking the Habit: In this song along with faint, the group experimented with a 10 piece string orchestra... And it sounds beautiful. The samples for this song sets the stage for the urgency of the song well.(8/10) <br />10)From the Inside: By far, my favorite song on the album. They've really achieved the epic feel that they were striving for with this song. Interplay between rapping and singing is also very well done. (10/10)<br />11)Nobody's Listening: Experimentation with japanese flute. More hip hop oriented. Thumbs up for trying. (5/10)<br />12)Session: This song owns Cure for the Itch. Best electronica/mixing I've heard from them yet. (10/10)<br />13)Numb: Third single. Pretty song but doesn't really stand out. (7/10)<br />Overall, this album is a must buy. The only complaint that I have is that it's a little on the short side clocking in at under 40 minutes. But, that's nothing new for Linkin Park. And I'd rather have quality over quantity any day.
B00009V7T2|5.0|I know it's been said before, but this album is amazing. Cedric's voice WILL blow you away, no arguement. Flea is on bass, playing stuff much much more techinical than his work with the Chili Peppers. The guitars are mind blowing, whether it's a complicated fill or a simple D minor. The complexity and technicallity musically and lyrically is incredible. Forget At the Drive-In for now, they were brilliant, don't get me wrong, but forget all you knew about them and all other music and pop this in. It's over an hour long and will be sure to occupy your stereo for a long time
0930289234|3.0|Many people have tried to convince me that the best the comics world has to offer is as good as the best that literature has to offer. I haven't seen it yet. I checked out some of this comic literature, fascinated with the form as I am, to see if this was true. Watchmen (along with the dark knight returns) is the best that the super-hero comic ever gets (so the critics say) and if this is it, then no, it's not equal to literature. The complexity seen in a Joyce novel, or Dostoyevsky, deals with more than Alan Moore has ever done in a single work (and yes I'm including From Hell and A Small Killing, even combined if you like!).<br /><br />  Most of what this comic has to say depends upon your experience with comics in general. If you know the formula behind super-hero comics, understand some comic history (the types of heroes found in older comics of the twentieth century), and what had become of comics by 1985 (when moore was working out this graphic epic), then you will probably enjoy this a great deal. It is a good read, for a super-hero comic.<br />The art, however, is weak, even considering the time period. It is functional though and does not take away from the story, the inks do that! Comics of this time period (Dark Knight Returns and before that Ronin), had access to painted panels and were not limited to the old &quot;four colour&quot; format, which is how this is coloured. So the comic looks only mediocre, I guess it's the story that everyone is so keen on.<br />The story, on it's own, is pretty good, if a little far reaching.<br />What we have here is the world is doomed and only our cynicism can save us. This may be true. We also have a pirate comic in this comic, that very cleverly, tells almost the same story as the central comic. The pirate story imitates arcs that have happened, and that will happen while the story is carrying on outside of this realm. Reasonably clever, for a comic writer. Best of all we have a tough to figure out &quot;whodunnit&quot;, in classic pulp form. All these elements tie in together and the final volume of the story closes up all the stories quite nicely, yet I still have problems....why is that?<br />  If someone had told me that this was the best comic ever, I might have given it five stars, however, what I have been told is that this is equal to literature of the highest order. On that level I give this only three stars. It is not great literature. I finished reading it in one afternoon and had completely digested it, and read it a second time by the evening. It wasn't hard to tie it all together. I still can't figure out what happened in The Grand Inquisitor (one chapter in The Brothers Karamazov by Dostoyevsky), on anything other that a basic level. That basic level is more profound and potent than anything in Watchmen, which although good, doesn't even come close to living up to the hype as literature with super-heroes.<br />What this comic talks about more than anything is that man needs to be saved from himself, more than anything else. Heroes aren't there to save us from monsters, they're there to save us from our fellow man. The Comedian even mentions this quite explicitly. Watchmen is a good time if you know what you are getting into. It's a fun and intelligent comic that is worth reading if you like comics already.<br />Lastly, it is worth mentioning that I do believe in an objective principle in art. I believe that there is some objective force that decides once and for all that Shakespeare is better than Septembers Cosmopolitan magazine. There has to be an objective force in art or it means nothing at all (except to you alone, which is the same thing as meaning nothing at all!). And from the comparisons I have Alan Moore is no Dostoyevsky and Dave Gibbons is no Rembrandt. That said, it is still a fun read.
B00005JKHP|2.0|It is amazing that this first installment in the Star Trek series spawned five sequels.  Bogged down by long, twenty minute special effect sequences, this movie maintains the feel of the original series by highlighting how slow and methodical the original crew actually was.<br />Now that's not to say that the storyline is bad.  The movie opens with a spectacular sequence between a Klingon battle cruiser and a strange, alien cloud on a direct heading for Earth.  Unfortunately for the Klingons, there weapons are all rendered useless by balls of electrical energy launched by the cloud and their ship is eventually destroyed.<br />Enter James T. Kirk, a former Starfleet captain who is using this new threat to Earth as a chance to regain command of the Enterprise.  There's also Spock, a Vulcan who has decided to give up pure logic to go on a wild chase with his old friends to commune with the alien intelligence at the center of the alien cloud.  Ultimately, with a few casualties along the way, the crew learns that the cloud is being piloted by V'ger, a three hundred year old satellite launched by NASA over three hundred years ago.  Having gained sentience after years of exploring the universe, the satellite has returned to Earth to join with its creator.<br />My recommendation with this movie is that you sit down and watch it with the intention of getting up multiple times.  As long as you keep that in mind, the twenty minute special effects segments which pepper this movie from beginning to end won't seem as long and the movie might actually seem enjoyable.

B000063UV9|4.0|This film directed by George Roy Hill and written by William Goldman in 1969 is a true classic western. Robert Redford as the Sundance Kid, and Paul Newman as Butch Cassidy are wonderful together. In their first film together, they play the roles of outlaws who make a living robbing trains. After a relentless posse is formed to track them down, Butch and Sundance are constantly on the run eventually flushed to Bolivia where they attempt to continue their wistful ways. The cinematography is breathtaking at times although i thought the scenes from Bolivia were somewhat poor. This box-office hit won two oscars, one by David Goldman for his script writing and the other by Burt Bacarach and Hal David for the movies theme song &quot;Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head&quot;. Katherine Ross also plays the part of Sundances beautiful girlfriend Etta Pace. If you are a Newman and Redford fan this is a must see! A bit of trivia: Newman first offered the part of Sundance to Jack Lemmon who declined.
B00005JLXE|4.0|The theatrical release got critically trashed, so I really didn't know what to expect from the DVD. But I found it very watchable. It spends too much time with the &quot;back story,&quot; but the mix of drama and action - dark as it is - is quite good. (and the CGI stuff isn't nearly as laughable as in Spider-Man).
B00004TRD8|5.0|I've seen this movie several times and it's still cool to watch. Rare combination of great action and a great storyline.
B00005JKHN|4.0|It took Disney's animators six years to create \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" and the effort really shows in this magnificent rendering of the German fairy tale \\"Dornroeschen\\" or \\"The Little Briar Rose.\\" The fairy tale is variously transcribed from European folktales by Perrault and The Bros. Grimm. (My favorite part in the Grimm rendering is how the arrival of the long-desired child is announced to the Queen-- she gets the news from a talking crab that jumps out of her bathwater. Now, what kind of crab would that be?)<br />Disney recreates the old tale with new characters--giving the good and evil fairies much more of a role--in fact, they steal the show. The good fairies are Flora, Fauna and Merrywether, three chubby, bell-shaped sprites, who were inspired by housewives the artists observed in grocery stores. And Maleficent, the stylish, Goth baddy who is tall, slim and has a bit of a smoker's rasp in her deliciously evil voice (played by Eleanor Audley.)<br />The fairies, good or evil, have so much to do, in fact, that Princess Aurora only gets to sing a bit (by an exceptional operatic soprano Mary Costa) and Prince Philip is equally reticent. The Prince gets a shocker early on in the tale--he has somehow been betrothed to Aurora since early childhood, but this interesting fact wasn't communicated to him until just before the wedding is to go off.) He is understandably miffed, gee, a guy should have SOME say in the matter, even if he doesn't get to pop the question, and after a set-to with Mom and Dad, he never says another word.<br />The real star here is the production, with the stylish Scandinavian Sixties art by Ervind Earle. Earle looked to folk art, Medieval art and tapestries for inspiration and mixed it with a fine modern sensibility to make a stunning set.  The animation owes a lot to Fantasia, which is especially noticible in the automated mops (Night on Bald Mountain) and Maleficent's domain. The artists wanted to avoid a repeat of \\"Snow White\\" and they certainly achieved a completely different look and feel. And taking the best of \\"Fantasia\\" was a good idea--as \\"Fantasia\\" itself was way ahead of its time and underappreciated until much later than its release in the Forties.<br />As to quality of the DVD, there was a glitch just as Philip is delivering the wakeup kiss to Aurora, the film jumps as if a few frames were cut. A glitch on this particular DVD? Strange that this happens at a critical moment.  The extras are well worth looking at, especially the interview with Earle and getting a look at the exquisite detail of the background artwork, giving any parent or grandparent a reason to enjoy the film for their own reasons while it runs for the umpteenth time on the DVD player.y achieved a completely different look and feel.

B000089RVX|5.0|I think that this cd is one of the best ones I have heard this year. It is a mix of Enchantment, Dark, and mysterious. <BR>Amy Lee has a voice of an Angel that can send chills up and down your spine and also at the same time bring tears to you eyes. The lyrics are very dark but beautiful and shows the beauty of the goth world. The songs are so deep with her passion that it can take you to places in your mind that you would have never known you had. So my opinion is This album is worth spending the money on.
0060229357|5.0|I'm now 38 years old, I read a lot as a child and my \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" books were read again and again for many years.  I was delighted to find this book with all of Crockett Johnson's \\"Harold and the Purple Crayon\\" stories in them because I could introduce my nephew and niece to a character and stories I loved.  My nephew dove right into the book when I gave it to him and told him how much I loved the same stories when I was his age.  Parents, I strongly recommend this book because it's the original stories all in one book, the pictures are simple and engaging, the writing isn't overly complex or simplified, so it helps build reading/spelling skills and vocabulary.
B000001GBJ|5.0|I got this CD a long time ago and didn't pay attention to it until I had my first baby. I put it all the time during those long nights nursing and when trying to put him to sleep. It was really relaxing and calming not only for the baby but for the mom! Now we use it with my two boys during quite time or before bed, they love it as much as I do. It's amazing how they calm down and listen to each song. Even when The Rap starts its beat they keep listening in peace. It's refreshing, uplifting, sincere, simple music. I'd love to get the 2nd CD.
6305095442|5.0|The Evil Dead trilogy is unique in the fact that it is one of those rare series where a movie's sequels prove to be more popular than the original. Often when you hear a fan quote something from the Evil Dead franchise, they're picking out a line from Evil Dead 2 or 3 (a.k.a. Army of Darkness). <br />If you know anything about the film, you know that Evil Dead 2 isn't really a sequel; it's more of a rehash of the original with Bruce Campbell playing the hapless chump, Ash, who accidentally unleashes a horde of demonic spirits out in the woods. The demons possess his girlfriend, try to kill him, and attempt to possess Ash himself. Meanwhile, a seperate group of college students (going to the cabin to visit some relatives who have discovered the Book of the Dead) and rednecks (leading the way since the bridge is out)  appear only to find Ash and all hell broken loose. <br />This go-round, Raimi and company inject a healthy dose of slapstick humor into the world of the Evil Dead. No other leading man has endured as much punishment as Bruce Campbell in Evil Dead 2 or its follow-up. The demons don't so much as kill him as beat him senseless, time and time again. In fact, rather than kill him, the evil spirits have more fun just possessing Bruce's hand and forcing him to smash a stack of dishes over his own head. His girlfriend's head pops up just to chew on his fingers. In short, Ash has a bad night.<br />The Evil Dead in this movie definitely have a sense of fun. A flying eyeball lands in the mouth of a screaming female. A ghoulish woman creeps about in the fruit cellar, and the deer head mounted on the wall laughs at Bruce's misfortunes with an eerie glee. <br />Needless to say, Evil Dead 2 is zanier and more over the top than Raimi's low-budget original. Sure, there are decapitations and death. Sure, there are dismemberments. However with tongue-planted-firmly-in-cheek, Raimi's manic energy behind the camera is as entertaining as ever. The camera chases Ash through every room of the cabin. The camera smacks against Ash and follows him as he goes soaring through the trees and lands head-first into a mud puddle. The camera goes just about everywhere and anywhere Raimi wants it to, often in places where you least expect. <br />Bruce Campbell falls into classic-Ash mode in this film, particularly near the end when he decides to face the evil head on. Hard to fight evil with only one hand? Well, stick a chainsaw in its place, and Ash is ready to roll. How does Ash prepare himself to go against the forces of evil? What words of wisdom does he have? &quot;Groovy.&quot;<br />Evil Dead 2 cemented Raimi's reputation as a cult favorite and as a director with an eye for visual excitement. Bruce Campbell still enjoys a heathly cult fan base, due mostly for this role. If you're looking for some silly, mindless horror fun, this is your film.<br />Evil Dead 2 comes with a decent amount of extras. As always, Raimi and Campbell put together a very informative and entertaining commentary track. There's also a featurette entitled &quot;The Gore the Merrier.&quot; You can view the film in either widescreen or full frame, and it's much, much prettier than that old VHS copy your videostore still carries. <br />This film is a must for horror fans, Raimi fans, and Bruce Campbell stalkers.
0385504209|5.0|Dan Brown knows how to write a thriller. The pages of this book know how to turn, almost by themselves. He also has a wonderful knack for blurring the line between fact and fiction but this is very much fiction, however it is depicted.<br />In the beginning of the novel our hero, Robert Langdon, is called by the French police to help understand some strange symbology in the death of a curator at the Louvre. This starts a breathtaking journey through art and religion, Paris and London as he searches, with the aid of a young French woman and an eccentric English gentleman, for clues leading to ancient secrets.<br />In the background hovers \\"The Teacher\\", a mysterious figure who seems to be almost one step ahead of them at each turn. His disciple (or henchman!), Silas, is pursuing them with equal vigor thus setting the scene for this very suspenseful thriller.<br />The puzzles were well thought out and, better still, solvable by the casual reader which always gives a sense of satisfaction. My only real quibble was with the motivations of one of the minor characters - a bank manager - and when that's the biggest problem with a novel, it must be good.<br />There are obviously a large, vocal contingent who dislike this book on religious grounds. Everyone is entitled to their opinion but, for my view, it is still a work of fiction that some historical factual input. The weaving of the two is what provided much of the interest for me.<br />I have since read Angels & Demons. If you enjoyed that novel, you will find much to enjoy here too. There are certainly a lot of similarities in the construction of the books but both stand on their own and both are highly recommended.
B0000041ZT|5.0|...well, it's not-so-unusual in that the music reflects some of the more popular idioms from throughout Shostakovich's life. However, this is not the typical fare we expect from this composer, whose symphonies and string quartets are amongst the most important of the 20th century. Perhaps the most awesome fact is that this contemporary music permeated Soviet censorship, even making it onto the concert stage. And jazz seems to be a field Shostakovich entered with great aplomb - he had a high regard for a wide variety of jazz musicians, and these compositions prove he had more than merely a fleeting interest in writing music which reflected this style. <br />The jazz suites are excellent - light, attractive and witty, but it's his take on 'Tea for Two' ('Tahiti Trot') which is the most interesting. Challenged by conductor Nikolai Malko to come up with an orchestration of this piece within an hour, he managed to do it in 40 minutes - when listening to this you soon realise the complete genius he was when it came to orchestral arranging. <br />I love Shostakovich's typically passionate music, and this disc makes a different but very worthy addition to the collection.
0312305060|5.0|I borrowed this from my wife after running out of vacation reading of my own. I didn't really expect to get much out of it and was delighted to find that it was truly beautiful and a very easy read.<br />The concept for the hours comes from Virginia Woolf's Mrs Dalloway, a book I haven't read. I can't comment on whether you would get more from this novel if you had read Mrs Dalloway first but it's certainly not essential. The basic idea behind Mrs Dalloway are clearly brought out in the chapters that act as a kind of one-day biography for Virginia Woolf.<br />I also haven't seen the movie; my wife, who has, felt that the film had done such a good job that she didn't get much out of the book.<br />The novel intertwines the semi-biographical aspects of a day in Virginia Woolf's life with that of two American women. One is a homemaker in the late 40s who is reading Mrs Dalloway and wondering if her condition can shed light on what is wrong in her life; the other is a woman in New York in the nineties planning a party for her dying friend Richard. Both stories are neatly intertwined with Mrs Dalloway in a number of ways both plotwise and thematically.<br />And it is this intertwining that pulls the book along so well. It would have been so easy to spoil the flow or make things to obvious but Michael Cunningham succeeds beautifully in making the independent lives so connected for the brief day.
0156027321|4.0|Ok, stop me if you've heard this one before: a Hindu, a Christian, a Muslim, a 450-pound Bengal tiger, and God are stranded together on a 27-foot-long lifeboat in the Pacific Ocean.  No, this isn't some cheesy barroom joke.  Instead, it's the central story of Yann Martel's entertaining and touching novel &quot;Life of Pi.&quot;  But I hope I didn't mislead you on three points.  Firstly, part of the story is told in a cafe, not a bar.  Secondly, the Hindu, the Christian, and the Muslim aren't three different people.  They all happen to be the same 16-year-old boy: Piscine Molitar Patel, zookeeper's son who is drawn to different religions through their appealing stories.  He's called Pi for short (one of the clever and, as it turns out, signficant things about this novel is that Pi has a nonrepeating decimal that stretches to infinite for a nickname).   And thirdly, and most importantly, despite the novel's main message that it's good to believe in God,which can come across as sappy if not handled properly, this tale of survival is not cheesy at all.  In fact, it's quite captivating.<br />Although the central story consists of young Pi's attempt to survive with a Bengal tiger, &quot;Life of Pi&quot; also tells several interesting, sometimes heartbreaking, but often humerous stories about Pi, which when taken as a whole portray a complete picture of, you guessed it, the life of Pi.  Amusing as most of these chapters are, it's not until the  novel is finished that the reader will understand how these different parts relate.  But it's worth the wait.  Even if the reader can't specifically describe how each chapter is significant to the entire novel, one has the feeling that if one of these chapters were removed, the story would not have the same impact.<br />The novel begins In India with Martel, having just written a failure of a story, stumbling upon a man in an cafe who claims he has &quot;a story that will make you believe in God&quot; (Author's note X).  This leadsMartel back to Canada to meet the now grown-up Pi who tells him his story.  Pi's story doesn't start with him and the tiger;in fact, your'e almost one third of the way through the  novel before it's explained how a shipwreck forces this unlikely pair together.  Before then Martel treats the reader to enjoyable, althogh seemingly irrelevant, stories about Pi's life that mostly center around four main topics: Pi's name, zoos and animals(which proves to be important since a  basic understanding of is necessary in order for the believablity of Pi's survival),  religion, and Martel's meetings with Pi.<br />And then you arrive at the main part of the novel: Pi's survival on a lifeboat with a tiger.  Pi's story has all the horrors of surviving a shipwreck, but since it is told from the first person perspective of Pi many years after he survived the ordeal, the reader knows Pi survives and makes a new life for himself.  This hindsight allows Pi to find humor in his terrible situation, such as the sinking of a bushel of bannanas, his discovery that &quot;Norweigan cuisine was the best in the world!&quot; (144), and of course, the humor in  having a wild animal that's first instinct is to kill prey as Pi's sole companion.<br />Of course some things are never funny, no matter how much time passes.  Some of these moments are particularly horrifying in their brutality, such as the deaths of the other animals aboard Pi's boat.  Pi's loneliness, occasional madness, physical pain, and his incredible thirst are also appalling.  These harsh reminders provide an even greater shock and stir more emotion in the reader due to the contrast with previous humor.<br />One problem one might have on first reading this novel is that his tale of survival is, it seems, just that: a how to manual on how to survive with a tiger, but not a religious tale.  And if it's not a religious tale than what was the point of the religious references?  It seems like he survives thanks to his strength of will,cunning, natural survival instinct, and &quot;life-hungry stupidity&quot; (148).  However, after Pi returns to society it's possible to understand how certain events of the novel, and certain aspects of Pi's life, relate directly, but not obviously, to one another.  <br />The old man in the coffee shop promises to tell a story that will make a person believe in God.  It's important to remember that Martel never makes this bold claim himself;therefore, the success or failure of this novel should not be based on whether the reader believes in God at at the end.  Rather, Martel shows unbelievable human suffering, incredible human triumph, and his story helps us to understand how people make sense of these things that seem impossible to imagine.  Whether in society or isolation, it becomes clear that people need a sense of order to survive, just as Pi thinks at one point, &quot;I'll tell you, that's one thing I hate about my nickname, the way that numbers run on forever.  It's important in life to conclude things properly&quot; (285).  Since God is infinite, Pi must make sense of life in simpler terms.  Just as stories about the different religions enable Pi to undertand them, just as Pi's name is used in math to make sense of a never-ending number, just as Zoo's provide structure and good homes because &quot;they bring together in a small space what in the wild is spread out&quot; (17), the rites and rituals of a religion can help people to make the mysterious tangible.  Similarly, by telling his story Pi comes to grips with the horrors he faced.<br />Martel's engaging ability to relate seemingly separate things, such as zoos, religion, survival, math terms, and storytelling, make this novel a great success.  You still may have one problem though: this novel may not help you figure out why or how some people have a seemingly infinite supply of cheesy barroom jokes.

B00004YRQA|5.0|This is one of the best cards on the market.  The Nyko ones are good, too (those are the yellow and black ones).  I never lost data for any game except DDR MAX, and that was my fault, not the card.<BR>Although I've never tried, EGM and other PS2 mags say these can be flushed in the toilet, smacked with a baseball bat, run over by a car, ect., ect., ect. for another half page.  AND STILL WORK!  Like I said, I've never tried.  But I like it.  Plus, black is cooler than yellow.
0688163173|3.0|Some folks have written about the (allegedly) earth shattering conclusion, but I felt the first half of the book was better than the second. The very first chapter, in my opinion, basically ruins ending (in that it isn't coherent/consistent with it, in my opinion). I very much like how the story was built. Also enjoy the concise language and tension. It's a good read.
B00003CXAA|4.0|I think godfather I and II are the best american movies ever. But the third part is totally ruined by Sofia Coppolas awful acting. Talia Shire was also awful on the first one, fortunately not bad enough to ruin it. (She did improve for the other 2 movies). Why doesnt director Coppola leave his family out of the business?

B00005ATQI|4.0|The Shining completely fullfills at least some of my criteria for a good horror film.<br />The Shining has ambience/atmosphere. Not all horror films succeed where the Shining succeeds. The two other horror films that possess these qualities to the same degree are the original Halloween and Suspiria.<br />If I were to review this film based only on the ambience it manages to create, it would probably be worth five stars.<br />Ambience and mood are perhaps The Shining's strongest features. The sound trak, also, plays no small role in creating the film's ambience in combination with the cinematography. The acting of the three main characters is above average.<br />Like most horror films, The Shining does not seem to be particularly cerebral or sophisticated - at least in terms of the plot and subject matter. Appearances are deceptive. I believe that the combination of cinematography and music provide a sophisticated experience for any sensitive and sophisticated horror fan.<br />The plot, by itself, is in my opinion a rather empty no brainer; rather it is everything other than the story that combines to make this film into a work of art.

Start to finish, it's a great ride, and almost trancelike in its repetitiveness.  Has outlasted &quot;Tonight's the Night&quot; and &quot;Rust Never Sleeps&quot; in the relevance department.
0156027321|1.0|I resented the time I spent reading Life Of Pi. Having just finished Atonment I was counting on the Amazon reviewers to guide me to another jewel. I read on thinking it must get better, more realistic, more intelligent, maybe even more lyrical. I fount myself skimming the pages hoping something would happen to make me care. Maybe I did miss the boat but if it was that small fleet with the tiger I am glad Istayed with my feet not my head in the sand.
0156027321|4.0|\\"Things didn't turn out the way they were supposed to, but what can you do?  You must take life the way it comes at you and make the best of it\\" (Martel, 91). This is the essence of Yann Martel's powerful novel.  The story is of a young man, Piscine \\"Pi\\" Patel, and his extraordinary journey through one of the most gruesome and horrible ordeals one could imagine.<BR>  <BR>We begin with Pi as a young boy in his native India, Part I of Martel's three-part book.  Pi explains how he received his nickname, how he lived in and around his father's zoo, but most importantly, he tells of his religious practices.  Pi is not only a Hindu, but also a Christian and Muslim.  It is here that Pi seems to quarrel with faith and one of its most fundamental questions: which one faith is the \\"right\\" one.  His answer: none of them and all of them.  Pi found that some of what one religion taught paralleled with what another practiced as well.  It occurred to Pi that none of these religions is the \\"right\\" one, his thinking being that they are ALL essentially one in the same: all seeking to love God.  It wasn't easy for Pi.  He had his parents as well as figureheads from all three religions telling him to choose only ONE.  But Pi did not falter, and became an advocate of all three.  Right here in Part I, the reader can begin to notice how \\"things didn't work out\\" for Pi, yet he persisted and made the best of his situation.<br />Part II is really the bulk of the novel.  This is the section in which Pi's entire ordeal is told.  While emigrating from India to Canada with his family, Pi is shipwrecked and forced to live aboard a lifeboat for over 200 days with an adult male Bengal tiger.  Pi's situation is the lowest of lows, the worst of all bad situations.  Though he has food and water, it is not enough to sustain him for such a long period of time, and all the while he much get along with (and survive from) a meat-eating tiger living in the same boat.  A rather tall order, but again, Pi makes the best he can of his seemingly hopeless situation.  But Martel's novel is not only about taking life as it comes and making the most of it.  His book also deals with facing the unknown.  While aboard the small lifeboat with his nearly quarter-ton companion (the tiger, Richard Parker), Pi faced (literally and figuratively) a sea of unknowns, perhaps the biggest of which was how to survive from the tiger while also surviving from the elements at the same time.  Pi drifted along the surface of the Pacific Ocean, headed for an unknown destiny, unsure of how, when, or even if he would arrive.  Along the way, Pi learned to improvise.  So, in the worst of all bad situations, Pi refused to roll over and die.  He crashed head-on into the unknown, never giving up, never losing hope.<br />My only criticism of the novel is that I'm not totally sure how Pi's enthusiastic behavior about religion fit the actual conflict of the story.  Most of this book was spent on the lifeboat with two characters: Richard Parker and Pi.  During this time, the reader sees a wide array of emotions and feelings from the two: perseverance, fear, anguish, disgust, all of their sheer joy and realistic pain.  The reader observes Pi in the midst of a completely lopsided and uphill battle for his life; he remains amazingly confident and optimistic throughout his entire ordeal.  Where most of us would have given up, Pi pressed on.  However, I didn't feel as though his rich religious background fueled his persistence.  I pulled out and comprehended all of this from the novel, but I do not see this book as having a highly religious quality about it.  This novel dealt with the power of the human will above all things.<br />One review about this book was that it would \\"make you believe in God.\\"  If I had been an atheist, I do not think that this particular book would have intrigued me to go out and attend Mass or go get Baptized.  Nonetheless, I think that Martel's novel was extremely powerful and intriguing: he had me reading until the very last page.  I liked how Martel attacked the idea of only having or practicing ONE religion, but I didn't feel as though it had much to do with the story as a whole.  Pi's religious background added depth and personality to his character, but it never really came into play within the context of the story.  I would recommend this book to anyone who would enjoy a story about the power of optimism and the will to live, the refusal to roll over and die even in the most bleak and ominous situation, but I certainly wouldn't call it a \\"soul-searcher.\\"  In my opinion, Martel's message, plain and simple: \\"Play the hand that you are dealt.\\"
B00004STPT|3.0|It is incorrect to call &quot;Gladiator&quot; an action movie; the drama outlasts the action by several times.  this might be acceptable, but not in this case, when the emotional sections of the movie get so long and boring that you know  you won't miss anything if you get up for popcorn.  And the music is the same.  The two good tracks on the CD, &quot;The Battle&quot; and &quot;Barbarian Horde,&quot; are basically the same song, with a few differences made to accomodate the on-screen action.  Hans Zimmer's music is good, but in a ten minute song, the melody lasts maybe thirty seconds, which is unsatisfying, no matter how good the music is.
B000002J1S|5.0|I have introduced three of my girlfriends to this classic - and none of them left me because of it! I first heard it at 17 years of age in 1987 and it took me about ten listens to get &quot;into&quot; it. This is not Justin Timberlake and it is not Beyonce Knowles. It is so different to anything you hear on FM radio that it will be a shock to the system for a while. I have read here that it can be compared to Mozart of 200 years ago and I would agree. A few of the instrumentals on disc two go on a little bit, but that only takes its vote down from eight stars to seven and two thirds. Be patient with this disc: every person should have on their &quot;list of one hundred things to do before the grave&quot; at least trying to accept this album - 90 percent of you will love yourself for trying.
6305252521|5.0|For those of us who think that Hollywood studios are incapable of producing anything but loud, violent and mindless garbage (think \\"Gone in Sixty Seconds,\\" but one could cite endless examples), \\"The Truman Show\\" is proof positive that great movies are still possible.  <br />Truman Burbank is a bright, imaginative 30-year-old account executive at an insurance company with a pretty blonde wife and a best friend who fills vending machines for a living.  He lives on Seahaven Island, a near-perfect community where the sun shines and life is good.  But Truman, like George Bailey in Frank Capra's \\"It's a Wonderful Life,\\" has the urge to explore.  To see what's out there in the world beyond Seahaven Island.  And, especially, to find out what happened to the beautiful girl he briefly loved and lost in his college days when she abruptly moved to Fiji.<br />The truth is, of course, that his whole life is a lie.  Truman's life, 24-hours-a-day, is a television show broadcast live and without commercial interruption to the entire world -- and has been from the minute he was born.  It's the ultimate paranoid fantasy.  They really *are* watching him.<br />\\"The Truman Show,\\" while playing with some interesting ideas about the nature of reality, is not a heavy, didactic film.  It is both dramatic and, due to a brilliantly clever screenplay and the performance of Jim Carrey, surprisingly funny.  I especially liked the luminous Laura Linney as Truman's put-upon wife, who finally cracks under the pressure of living with a man who's beginning to comprehend and question the faux-nature of his reality.  Natascha MacElhone is oddly believable in the tiny but crucial role of the woman who loves Truman for who he really is.   <br />This DVD edition is pretty sparse -- no extra scenes, no extra commentary by the star, the writer or the director -- but it is definitely worth the price.  While I would have liked to have heard director Peter Weir discuss, among other things, why Dennis Hopper wasreplaced in the role of Cristof (the \\"creator\\" of The Truman Show) by Ed Harris, the film itself is so good, so dense and so intriguing in its dramatic explorations of its themes and ideas that you can easily do without the extra goodies.  My one peeve with the DVD is the stupid blimp that you have to sit through in order to access certain features.  *That* I could have easily done without.<br />While the 1990s were a pretty pathetic era in American filmmaking, I would nonetheless put \\"The Truman Show\\" alongside \\"Good Fellas,\\" \\"Deconstructing Harry\\" and \\"Avalon\\" as one of the best mainstream films of the decade.  Highly recommended.
B00005JKZV|4.0|I've read several of the reviews, and the one thing noone has mentioned is the way Sam and Frodo's relationship is portrayed.  In the book (and I know now you are calling me a purist), Frodo and Sam love each other dearly.  Sam is like a father or big brother to Frodo.  This is an intense love and desire to protect that I think the movie misses entirely.  Frodo is at times portrayed as downright mean to Sam, I admit at times he was firm in the book when he rebuked Sam for his treatment of Gollum but in the movie you don't see that &quot;everything I am doing I am doing exclusively for you&quot; attitude that is so obvious in the original writing.  Sam was by Frodo's side, not because Galdalf said so, but because he was worried about his friend.  While I agree with the &quot;purist&quot; reviews and wish that so much of the storyline had not been changed to &quot;more interesting&quot; fighting scenes, I will happily view this film again and again and be happy with what Tolkien I can get.  I still appreciated Fellowship much more due to the close adherence to the original storyline.  I have to thank Peter Jackson for bringing to the screen the personification of what I had for so many years been viewing in my imagination and doing  it so well that I could honestly say it could have been my imagination I was seeing (this is especially true of Aragorn, ooohh baby!) I went to the midnight showings of Fellowship (which I left with a tear in my eye) and Two Towers (which I left wondering if maybe I should have just gotten a good night's sleep) and I will be present for the midnight of Return of the King, but this time I will be much more guarded in my expectations.

0066214122|3.0|In the first third of the book, Crichton delivers a fun read particularly with the emerging technologies and future possibilities of combining genetic and software engineering. Overall I liked the book, but by the middle, I tired of the the same old teritory that I had just visited a chapter back. Chapters flow by all taking place with the same cast of characters in the same setting asking the same questions. The book labors in the middle to try and tie up loose ends and reveal character traits both good and bad. The ending feels as if the editior got tired too, and told Chricton to end it and move on to his next effort. Worth the read but invest in the paperback and save your dough for a more &quot;library-worthy&quot; hardcover. - B.C.
B00005JLTN|4.0|Sure it's not going to be the first movie over again, but it stands on its own and delivers. I found the plot twists captivating and the special effects great. I will buy this on DVD and I will go see the third when it comes out in November.
B00005JKN9|4.0|I regret not seeing this film in theaters, I was really missing out. Well done, well written, and well performed. Gangs of New York city kept my interest until the end. Definet must see for many people.
B00003CXZ1|5.0|I finally figured out why so many Tomb Raider fans hated this movie. Usually, when movies are based on comic books or video games the general public will hate them. Just like they did with Tomb Raider. But it shocked me to find out so many of the fans also hated it. The only excuse I found was &quot;The only way it related to Tomb Raider was the title.&quot; I didn't understand this. It has Lara Croft looking, talking and acting in the exact way she does in the games. She raids tombs like she does in the games. Everything seemed perfect to me. So what was different? Why didn't the fans like it? The answer is Lara's father. In the game Lara's parents disown her and Lara makes her fortune on her own. In the movie Lara's father loves her and is killed on an adventure. That's it. That's why this movie was trashed so badly. Can you believe it? I've played all the Tomb Raider games and even I didn't pick up on that difference because it's so minuscule. It's like Batman fans not liking the Batman movies because the bat symbol on his chest was a half inch too small. It's this kind of nit picking that completely ruins the movie going experience. Tomb Raider is an excellent old fashion adventure movie and if people would take it for what it is then it would get the respect it deserves. But with people picking apart every frame of film that will never happen.
B00003CXRP|5.0|If you watch Cast Away simply as a movie then you will lose a powerful opportunity for introspection.  <br />The power of this movie lies in its applicability to everyone.  To Hanks' character the island is far more than a hunk of rock in the South Pacific.  It represents a huge hurdle for him to clear and in clearing it his coming to grips with his life and who he is.<br />Regardless of who you are there are times in life that relegate us to times and situations of frustrating solitude, our own islands, if you will.  We, like Hanks' character, run ourselves crazy trying to work things out ourselves only to discover, as he did, &quot;that we have power over nothing.&quot;  We also learn that if we keep on breathing and living &quot;tomorrow the sun will rise and who knows what the tide could bring.&quot;<br />Expertly acted by Tom Hanks, Cast Away invites us to put ourselves in his shoes and imagine what we would do.<br />Yes, the script is predictable but it goes well beyond the story on the screen.  Watch it and apply it to your own islands, whatever they may be, and this movie will be one that you find yourself watching again and again.
B00005V3Z4|4.0|While looking through these numerous reviews, it's hard to separate the people who like the movie because they think it's cool-looking and those who actually understand it, specifically the ending. Even if you do get the ending, it only deserves four stars. Don't get me wrong, there's nothing wrong with four stars. But there really aren't any original ideas. Think of it as a remake of the New Testament. Remakes can be very good, as this one is, but they're simply not original. So if you're looking for a ground-breaking, exceptional piece of cinema this will probably fool you into thinking it is. For everyone else who simply want a good movie different from your standard fare, look no further. To simplify it even further,unless you're searching for the best movie ever, see this one. If you don't get it the first few times you probably never will so have someone explain it to you.
0375751513|5.0|More than a story, The Picture of Dorian Gray contains many of Oscar Wilde's most famous commentary on life.  Unlike any other work of fiction that I have read before I actually read this book with a pen in hand, underlining Wilde's eloquent thoughts about art, tragedy and life.<br />No need to recap the story here other than to say that it continues to be applicable to every human being born into this world.  Each of us has our own picture that reflects our deepest and truest feelings, thoughts and actions.  Facades abound but there is no getting around our frequent trips inside to have a look at the portrait that only we can see.<br />A masterful book that goes far beyond the well-known story.
B000089A07|4.0|After HANNIBAL, the Hannibal legacy quited down it's reign of praise for a while.  RED DRAGON is the next of the Lecter legacy, although chronologically the first; it follows retired FBI agent Will Graham (Edward Norton), who is called back to action help track down a serial killer (Ralph Fiennes) who is more than he seems; at the same time, he enlists the aid of Dr. Hannibal &quot;The Cannibal&quot; Lecter (Anthony Hopkins), whom Graham imprisoned years before.  Norton leaves an excellent first impression on me; Fiennes is great and brings much more sympathy to the character than Ted Levine did in THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS; Hopkins is, of course, excellent.  There is a great score by Danny Elfman, and surprisingly terrific directing by RUSH HOUR's Brett Ratner.  Scripted by Ted Tally, who adapts the novel so well that it serves as an example for adaptations everywhere.  Hannibal lovers, dispair not; writer Tally has also added in a larger part for Dr. Lecter than in the novel.  Thomas Harris' best-selling novel was previously adapted in the much inferior MANHUNTER in 1986.
0761925538|5.0|Read it to prepare for my master's thesis and probably will use it for my doctoral thesis as well. Brings the detailed methodology for case study research in perfectly synchronized chapters. Extremely valuable information! Sometimes even Mr. Yin has so many info to provide he has some difficulty putting it all together, but after all everything makes a lot of sense. Has dozens of very good examples. I am purchasing &quot;Applications of case study research&quot; (the &quot;sequel&quot;) because I was really satisfied for what I got in reading Case Study Reasearch (3rd ed).
0792833236|5.0|RAGING BULL is a legend.  Out of all of the films of the 1980's, on a great many occasions it has come out to be number one.  But what is, really, RAGING BULL?  RAGING BULL is Martin Scorsese's masterpiece drama that tells the true-life story of heavyweight champion Jake LaMotta, played by Robert De Niro in one of his greatest performances.  Through a span of about fifteen years, the film tells the story of LaMotta's extremely troubled life in and out of the ring, as he becomes paranoid about his young wife's (Cathy Moriarty) loyalty, finds encouragement from his street-smart brother (Joe Pesci), and faces undeserved defeat.  De Niro is outstanding; Pesci is great; and Moriarty is very impressive in her first film role.  Scorsese's directing also excellent - after this film he was forever cemented as one of, if not THE greatest director of all-time.  The editing is also complimentary, by Thelma Schoonmaker.  The film, like GOODFELLAS, is so brutally releastic it's almost impossible to watch, but it's an unmissable part of cinema history.
B000003S09|5.0|King Crimson's 1969 debut album, &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King,&quot; remains an all-time progressive rock classic. The very first line-up of the band, including master guitarist Robert Fripp, bassist/vocalist Greg Lake (later to join Emerson Lake &amp; Palmer), and keyboardist/flautist Ian McDonald created a bold, daring rock album that practically laid down the blueprint for all progressive rock bands to follow. It's music is at times fierce &amp; ferocious (the band's signature freak-out, &quot;21st Century Schizoid Man&quot;), while at other times dramatic (&quot;Epitaph&quot; &amp; the title song), and hauntingly beautiful (&quot;I Talk To The Wind&quot; and &quot;Moonchild&quot;), with a good deal of studio experimentation tossed in for extra measure (such as the lengthy instrumental section of &quot;Moonchild&quot;---it may try some listeners' patience at first, but it really is quite lovely, with the band making musical beauty out of the sparest of notes). King Crimson are progressive rock pioneers, who, 34 years later, and having endured various line-up changes along the way, are still going strong, continuing to make brilliant, sophisticated music to this day. But if &quot;In The Court Of The Crimson King&quot; had been their only album, King Crimson still would've carved a very special place for themselves in the history of rock with this legendary masterwork.
B00006IUL7|4.0|Masterfully-woven remake of the 1997 Norweigan film about an L.A. cop (Al Pacino) who succumbs to corruption in a northern town where the sun never sets.  A wonderfully entertaining thriller from director Christopher Nolan (MEMENTO), who proves he is a truly outstanding filmmaker.  Hillary Seitz provides the script; David Julyan composes the score; there's also some really great editing (Dody Dorn) here.  Pacino is terrific, although he's much changed since films like THE GODFATHER and SCARFACE; Robin Williams proves he's a master of acting with his first role as a villain; Hilary Swank is great as well, as the cop who returns Pacino's rest.  One of the best films of 2002, no doubt about it.
B0000024ZC|5.0|1972's &quot;Three Friends&quot; is Gentle Giant's third album (though the US release mistakenly uses the same cover art from the band's first album), and it's a magnificent work. A concept album, &quot;Three Friends&quot; is a 35-minute, six-part opus, telling the tale of three young friends who go to school together, but are separated as they get older, and their lives take them down different paths---one becomes a construction worker, the second a painter, and the third a businessman. A simple story, but very effective, anchored by Gentle Giant's brilliant music. The band's musicianship, arrangements, and vocalising are all superb, the music haunting and powerful. While my personal favorite GG album remains &quot;The Power And The Glory,&quot; there's no denying that the band definitely pushed up the bar another notch with &quot;Three Friends.&quot; It's a Gentle Giant classic, and a must-own album for any fan of progressive rock.
B00005RYL9|5.0|Who wants to live forever?  This is the theme of HIGHLANDER, a film which over time has firmly established a cult following as well as countless sequels and TV series.  Who would've thought that a low-budget film like this (which scored a mere $5,900,000 in the U.S., while becoming a huge hit internationally) would be so popular?<br />HIGHLANDER is the tale of Connor MacLeod (Christopher Lambert), a guy who, at first glance, would seem to be your normal 30-year-old New Yorker.  But then, take a closer look: that old look in his eyes, his wealth of knowledge, and - oh yeah, did I mention he RUNS AROUND NEW YORK WITH AN ANCIENT JAPANESE KATANA AND SLICES OFF PEOPLE'S HEADS!!<br />But all this isn't as odd as it sounds.  You see, MacLeod is one of a race of immortals, born in the highlands of Scotland 500 years ago.  In 1536, he was killed by the evil Kurgan (Clancy Brown) - and then he woke back up.  Woah.  After being brutally beaten and exiled from his hometown, he meets up with Ramirez (Sean Connery), a fellow immortal who teaches MacLeod the ways of their kind.  As it turns out, there can be only one, and that one will be the immortal that survives through the ages to the time of the Gathering in 1986.  The Prize they receive from being the final immortal is a chance to rule the world and have all their dreams come true.<br />HIGHLANDER is now a part of movie history, and in my opinion one of the most important films of the 1980's.  Lambert is very good (he would later appear in three sequels and one episode of the popular TV series), and Connery is funny - although he's in the film for a total of about 7 minutes.  Rock videomaker Russell Mulcahy's direction is nothing special, but it is done well, especially around the end of the film.<br />Of course, there's also a majestic, beautiful-sounding score from well-liked composer Michael Kamen, and an awesome rock soundtrack from Queen, which includes the very nice ballad \\"Who Wants to Live Forever\\".  The film's theme, \\"Princes of the Universe\\", later served also as the theme for the television show.<br />The film is extremely entertaining.  From the first moment of the movie, you're completely absorbed - something that could not be achieved in either HIGHLANDER II, III or ENDGAME - all of which are easy to ignore in the series' timeline.<br />If possible, I would definitely recommend that you watch the director's cut (or \\"Immortal Edition\\") rather than the theatrical version.  This cut is a very large improvement over the original film.  The DVD also features a remastered soundtrack and a Queen companion CD.<br />All in all, HIGHLANDER is an extraodinary film matched only by the television series.  It is certainly recommended to any and all.  Ignore the sequels completely, if you can (die-hard fans: rent HIGHLANDER III); for in the end, there can be only one.
B00000ILDE|5.0|This was a terrific action flick with a great plot and tremendous actors -- it's a classic, even better than the first \\"Alien.\\"<br />Having said that, I have to point out that I was repelled by the socio-political message this movie sends.  A team of US Colonial Marines is sent to a colony to kill alien beings there.  No one mentioned the possibility of involving other nations, of obtaining approval from the United Nations for unilaterally attacking these aliens.  And the diplomatic effort was absolutely non-existent, no effort whatever was made to deal reasonably with these aliens, to give them a chance to stand down and cease their hostilities.  At no point did the US characters ever ask, \\"Why do they hate us?\\"<br />While it's true an alien killed every member of Ripley's Nostromo crew without any warning whatever, a stunning surprise attack that terrorized the crew during a meal, there were no follow-up efforts to negotiate any sort of peace with the creature -- they just unilaterally decided to kill it, as was the case with a group of these alien beings in the sequel.  After the first attack on the Nostromo, everyone should have simply turned the page and moved on.  After all, what's passed is past, it's old news.  In the sequel, there was no patience or diplomacy whatever in dealings with the aliens, the crew simply attacked and attempted to kill all of them they could.  <br />What if the aliens were driven by an ancient religion that required them to kill all the members of any other species they encountered?  Who were these Marines, to question that cultural ideal?  The message this sends about such creatures is that the only way to stop them is to kill them, or they will always be striving to kill you.  The Marines should have done some yoga instead, and asked themselves again and again, \\"Why do they hate us?\\"  They at least should have sent in some inspectors -- and if that failed, they should have given the inspections more time to work.  Nothing in the world will deter terrorism more effectively than giving inspections more time to work.
B000056N8X|2.0|In 2000, fans eagerly awaited the release of the latest HIGHLANDER sequel, titled HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME, and featuring both the star of the HIGHLANDER films (Christopher Lambert) and the star of the HIGHLANDER television series (Adrian Paul).  It would also feature some old friends and some new ones.<br />The plot involves an insanely depressed Connor MacLeod (Lambert), who's life is ruined when an old enemy (Bruce Payne) kills his beloved Rachel (Sheila Gish).  Ten years later, Connor has disappeared, and it's up to troubled Duncan MacLeod (Adrian Paul) to find him and defeat evil immortal Kell (Payne).  In the end, there can be only one.<br />What can I say?  HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME had so much potential.  Adrian Paul is the perfect way to keep the series going.  But H:E wastes it all, including an opportunity for scenes with Methos (Peter Wingfield) and Joe Dawson (Jim Byrnes).  The only good part of the film is Nick Glennie-Smith's score and the beautiful song \\"Bonny Portmore\\".<br />Then, we have this DVD: a new, badly-edited cut of the film.  It features (...) more violence, along with an alternate ending.  It's only a slight improvement over the original movie.<br />All in all, HIGHLANDER: ENDGAME is a waste of time, money, and potential.  Rent the original film instead.

B000022TSW|5.0|The show isn't at all for kids in the first place, but this movie, the most vulgar, insane, and amazingly funny movie I have ever seen, is the least kid friendly animated motion picture in existence. With nearly 400 swear words (many F***), it's no wonder it has an R rating. Although uproarius in itself, the funniest thing about this movie is that it's a MUSICAL! That's right, you heard me correctly, A MUSICAL!!!!!!!!! If you are at least 12, like to sing, like South Park, enjoy musicals, or are just looking for a great laugh, pick it up. You will die of hysteria.
B000002I53|5.0|I heard &quot;My Favorite Things&quot; in a Coltrane concert in Glasgow (Scotland) 40-odd years ago (must check the date). It was the standout number for me, but caused quite a few to leave the hall!! I think the Soprano Sax was too much for them, but it certainly made the hairs on the back of my neck stand up - I remember it even now.
0062502182|5.0|I really enjoyed this book.  I'm 24 - smack dab in the the height of my 'quarter life crisis' - and I found this fable to be charming and inspiring.  It serves as a great reminder that following one's heart can be a fulfilling experience even if there are bumps along the road.  This is not for the cynical type.  Rather it's for those who are open to blessings that come in small packages.  I intend to buy copies for friends.
B00008EY9G|4.0|It has been a while since there has been such a great murder mystery than this one. While recently having to sit thru a horrible film that didn't have a drop of fear or intrigue, it is refreshing to see a film that knows how to be scary and have fun doing it. Credit director James Mangold for his stylish, noirish eye, and screenwriter Michael Cooney for concocting a devilish web of mystery and suspense. It's the kind of movie that you will know right off the bat that you will really get into. It all starts during a dark and stormy night. Of course!. It's raining heavily and roads out in the middle of Nevada have been washed out. A group of strangers have been forced to seek shelter at this seedy, off the road motel. They have all crossed paths just minutes before, and it is show thru flashbacks how each one got connected together and ended up at the motel. There is Ed(John Cusack), a limo driver with a past job that makes him a strong leader in working out the mystery. He is driving a washed up actress(Rebecca DeMornay, who despite a hair color change, still looks great). She is the epitome of a spoiled, rich starlet. Success starved, and not willing to spend time in some mundane motel that doesn't have room service. Then there is Ginny(Clea DuValle), and her new husband Lou, who seem to not be the happiest of newlyweds. There's motel manager Larry(John Hawkes), who has some interesting secrets of his own; prostitute Paris(Amanda Peet), who is turning 30 in a week and just wants to go back home to Florida to grow oranges; and a normal, suburban type family led by John C. McGinley of \\"Scrubs\\", along with his wife(Leila Kenzle from \\"Mad About You\\" fame), and young son Timothy. Then things get weird when a cop named Rhoades(Ray Liotta), shows up with a prisoner(Jake Busey), in tow. He was supposed to be transferring the prisoner when they got caught up in the storm. There are numerous other things that have gone on and more in depth descriptions of the people, but telling would be spoiling all of the twists and turns this movie will take and how it will keep you thinking. Suddenly, one by one, the stranded motorists begin getting knocked off. When you think one way, you are suddenly proven wrong and think another way, until you finally come to the conclusion that you have no idea what is going on. The mystery is mind boggling and the turns in the story are clever and a lot of fun to figure out. Although you won't. You think that the murderer can't quite possibly pull this off, but it's even more interesting trying to figure out just who is behind it. The performances here are all stand out. Cusack is his usual reliable self, and Liotta is always convincing in everything he does. The rest are all up to the task as well. Jake Busey as the prisoner is good too. Then again, put someone with the last name of Busey in a psycho role, and you usually get an interesting performance. The movie really gets you to think, and Mangold's direction and keen eye for setting up chills and suspense are right on. The rain, the motel, the atmosphere, they are all just as much a part of the cast and the main story as the cast and story itself. What I always love about movies like this that have an eclectic cast of characters and actors is that I love watching how the different personalities interact and how they either disintegrate in the madness, or change for the better because of it. I have to say that the ending, while it may seem like a disappointment, is still very well executed and wonderfully constructed. It is a nice twist, but it does damage, in some way, what you have invested in it up to that point. I wasn't really disappointed because I thought that they had done it in a very creative, and well imagined way. Some people missed that. I really don't know what else to say without getting too much into the movie and giving things away. \\"Identity\\" is a suspense thriller that brings respect and dignity back to the genre. See it!.
B000089RVX|4.0|I listen to this CD all the time, and very loud!  My hat's off to the producer for the excellent work, and great sonic quality.  Dave Fortman, the producer, brings in some thick, full electric guitar sounds, and every once in a while- a tiny bit of electronica.  The keys are excellent (David Hodges, who also co-wrote almost all of the songs).  <BR>This is such a great CD.  All of the songs are good, not a bummer in the batch.<BR>What I will say is, I found alot of the same melodic structures throughout the project.  I also found alot of the same lyrical themes.  The word &quot;breathe&quot; is used in almost every song.  There are other lryical phrases that are overused throughout.  With a lyric like &quot;I'm pouring crimson regret&quot;, I know there's more talent there- just need to work harder.  <BR>Fortman has created a &quot;sound&quot; for Evanescence, and I hope it matures on the next CD.  Let some acoustics in, and cap the pain/death/black lyrics so the CD doesn't get bogged down in blackness.  Amy and Ben are too talented for that.  Even if &quot;that's just where they are right now&quot;.  That's the producers job to temper that.  <BR>I look forward to the next CD.
B0000A02TZ|2.0|I've always felt that ANIMAL HOUSE was one of the funniest comedies ever filmed, and I rejoice in the widescreen format, improved mastering and the Dolby audio... but I only gave this lousy re-release two stars.<br />Why? Well, I hope someone at Universal is reading these reviews:  DUMP THE MANDATORY PREVIEWS! And what about better content? The featurettes seem hastily-made and almost amateurish.  I wanted to see deleted scenes, like the legendary Stork and his slide rules -- I wanted outtakes, or more footage taken while the film was being produced.<br />If you already own the original release (like I do), then don't bother with this unless you have to have the widescreen format or the Dolby audio.
B000000WCX|5.0|This is my second favorite Bowie album after Outside.  I love most of his work but his mid-late 90's music is my favorite.  Again Bowie evolves his music and does something different.  while using techno beats that start off interesting but follow the overtly repetative nature of that style, the music applied to those beats is not something familiar to most techno styles except in its sample-flash-pan style.  most of this album is fast paced and upbeat.  it features great vocals as usual for Bowie and is co-written and co-produced by eccentric guitar player Reeves Gabrels.  a very interesting and creative musician in his own right.  Also including more collaboration with Brian Eno. other musicians on this album also do an interesting job of following Bowie in yet another direction.  Mike Garson's beautiful piano playing also peppers this album.  However it seems that its Bowie's vocals, the driving beats, and Reeves' outlandish guitar sounds that really give the album its defining traits and textures. A real gem on this album is Seven Years in Tibet, a bit different from the other tracks, has a very quiet dramatic verse and a heavy chorus and is loaded with unusual guitar tremolo flutter sounds that on the first few listens sort of make you wonder what it was you just heard. this song almost reminds me of something the Beatles might do if they were all still around today.  just a personal thought though. it has the most &quot;live band&quot; feel compared to the other songs. i recomend this to fans of electronic music, or just different music, or really open minded Bowie fans(and i suppose most Bowie fans are).  Bowie's more recent releases like Hours and Heathen depart largely from these Outside and Earthling styles (which while rather different in some aspects share a lot of common ground)and become more gentle to an extent, but are just as interesting.
B0000399WI|5.0|\\"The send you here for life, and that's exactly what they take.\\"<br />This is one of the most inspirational movies I've ever watched. There are few things more satisfying than seeing a man, horribly wronged by \\"the system\\", come out on top through sheer will and hope.<br />Another great part of this film is the portrayal of the other inmates. They had actually committed their crimes, but you couldn't help coming to realize that they were still human beings despite their screw-ups. I felt sorry for the abuses they endured at the hands of the guards. Once you cared about the characters, you couldn't help but be enraged by the corruption of the prison system.<br />But it all comes back to the overall theme, which is not giving up.  Not losing hope. You watch as over the long passage of time as the characters grow and change, and how their lives are changed and shaped by Andy Dufresne, and his basic life philosophy.<br />\\"Get busy living, or get busy dying.\\"
B0000959N0|4.0|Daredevil was an ok movie, alot better than i thought it would be. Although i thought there was going to be more fight scenes. Bullseye was only in it for a few minutes. Next time they need to make them fight more and not make everything happen in just one day.
B00007BK2N|3.0|24hr party people purports to show the rise and fall of post-punk and the beginnings of rave culture in Manchester, England at the end of the seventies, start of the eighties.  It makes an admirable attempt to do this, but it fails in many, many ways.<br />First of all, the story is too big to be seen through the eyes of one person (Tony Wilson, founder of the admirable Factory records collective), especially someone who is primarily so self-confessedly concerned with his place in history.  Tony Wilson did not create rave, and this film surely overplays his role in the founding of the scene.  By focussing in on this one label we lose a lot of the historical context, and the movie's habit of skipping years doesn' t help the flow of the narrative either.<br />Secondly, the movie also sacrifices a large amount of narrative flow for the sake of cinematic continuity.  While I have always been a huge fan of Joy Division, and know a fair bit about the Factory records story, I feel that people without a fair smattering of this background knowledge would've been lost in the sheer number of rapidly rotating characters, skipped years and seemingly unlinked events that all add up to the movie's climax.<br />While the broad scope of the movie can be blamed for these mistakes, the director and writers are also culpable for other issues.  I love Steve Coogan - he's a great comedian and a great actor, but he gets waaay too much screen time here, and way too many direct-to-camera monologues that occur outside of the historical flow of the film, and end up seeming  self-serving and gratuitous.<br />The movie also makes no attempt to develop the characters in the movie beyond a brief introduction.  Tony Wilson's motives for trying to create an anarchist-collectve record label are never explained, nor is there ever even any discussion of why his partners go along with it, especially as they spend large parts of the end of the movie trying to kill him.  Why did Ian Curtis kill himself?  Why is Shaun Ryder such a mess?  Why is Martin Hannett considered a \\"genius\\" when his sole contribution to the movie is to insult all the bands and irritate everybody he comes into contact with? The section on the rise of the drug-culture in the Hacienda also seem to have been written by Tony Wilson to excuse himself from wrong-doing, reading like a brief about to be submitted to a judge, \\"It wasn't my fault gov!\\".<br />All in all i think more impartiality would've helped this film.  More judgement, more character, more heroes and villans would've made it a better movie. More focus just on the Factory records experiment would've made it easier to digest, and less of the no-talent (...) clowns known as the Happy Mondays would've made the entire thing more palatable.<br />If you like the music, watch the film. If you don't know the background read some of the books about the period instead.  24 hour party people contains some good moments, but I'm not sure I'd sit through it again to see them...s Shaun Ryder such a mess?

B00004ZAV3|5.0|This is a great collection of Beatles' music, and serves as a good introduction to the band for new fans.  I prefer the sound of the Beatles' analog vinyl records, feeling that they have a greater openess and sense of space between the instruments than any of the issued cd's-as I often notice with Analog recordings vs. Digital ones.
B000002N3J|4.0|This, her 2nd of 3 collections, is the 3rd one to get if you're a collections person. It does present the &quot;softer&quot; side of &quot;Madonna&quot;, it only has 3 songs repeated from the other &quot;hits&quot; albums, and it does have a number of tracks the others do not. I think the cream here is &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, and her two soundtrack songs: &quot;I'll Remember&quot; and &quot;This Used to be my Playground&quot;. The other stuff is all good too, whether it's new, or album tracks like &quot;Oh Father&quot; and &quot;Forbidden Love&quot;. I would say that between this cd, &quot;The Immaculate Collection&quot;, and &quot;GHV2&quot;, the only missing hits are &quot;Bad Girl&quot;, &quot;Dress You Up&quot;, and &quot;Who's That Girl&quot;. I guess I can live without those.
B00005JKJA|5.0|l'm not one for most of David Lynch's works, but this one blew me away - wonderfully crafted, sort of a two-parter,e.g, illusion vs. reality, and a brilliant performance by Naomi Watts. The movie requires a bit of thinking, and a second look would be most worthwhile. lt challenges the viewer and cannot be viewed in a superficial manner as one would, say, view Batman or some such shlock.
B000000W6R|4.0|If you're someone like me, who believes the first two albums are the &quot;Pumpkins&quot; best, than you must get this cd. It may not run quite as smooth, but it's every bit as good as my favorite disc &quot;Gish&quot;, and &quot;Siamese Dream&quot;. Not knowing this album, is like not seeing one movie in a trilogy. Rockers and ballads together in perfect harmony. I wish bands today had A-sides that were this good.
B00005Q4CS|5.0|I read about it on the back of Scary Movie 2, so I read up on it, and herd it was a movie about 4 drug addicts with a scary message, so I decided to buy it.<br />I was really hoping to see a good movie, with messagaes shoved down my throat, well the movie was outstanding, and the messages were sure tough to swallow.<br />Ellen Burstien did a fabulas performance as Sara Goldfarb, a old woman on diet pills;  Jared Leto did a great job as well, as Sara's son Harry, who was just a plain drug addict; Jennifer Connelly did a good job of playing Harry's girlfriend, Marion, who had money, but no attention, so she's on drugs; and Marlon Waynes, at his more serious, less funny roles, does very good job of playing Tyrone, just like Harry, a plain drug addict.<br />That's pretty much all I'm gonna say about the movie, well at the end, that's where the big messages come in.  But to those who really want a more clear enjoyable reason to say no to drugs, then this is it.  I dunno if it will work or not, but it did for me.<br />peace
B00008NG5V|2.0|How did this man sell a million records? Was there some kind of beach party where his albums went on sale and you got something free with it? Granted his voice is quite pleasent but the songs in general all sound as if they came off a copying machine. I have figured out the plan you sneaky Island Records. Johnson's two albums were orginally one but you cut them up into two so that he could have 20 minutes in the sun instead of his alloted 15. Note to Johnson: you have real talent mate, ditch the beach blanket bullocks and start putting out something you can be proud of.
B00006LLNU|5.0|Let me start by saying that as of right now this is my all-time favorite album and may have actually helped Sigur Ros to surpass my previous favorite band - the Pixies (Listen I said MAY HAVE okay? The Pixies f***ing rock).  Ok.  At first I was a bit disappointed - I didn't like it as much as the first album.  After having the album for a few months I like this album better than the 1st.  In fact I see no comparrison.  I Love the Agetis Byjrum but frankly ( ) blows it out of the water (in a soothing slow-motion kind of way).  Actually I once compared ( ) to watching an explosion in slow motion and I think that's acurate, 'cause although it's slow and moody, it rocks.  It is just about the most potent thing I have ever experienced.  The kind of thing that makes you feel like you don't know whether to cry or vomit.  I'm thinking about buying an extra copy and like putting it in a vault.  You have to listen to the songs multiple times to appreciate them - In some cases I feel like you really have to.  Some of them will hit you right away but with others you kind of need to be able to sense what's coming and see the grand design of the songs, which takes time to perceive.  Anyway this is getting long...  I Love this damn CD more than just about anything, but I've found you really have to be obsessed with music to like this because friends of mine with no attention span or who aren't obsessed with music as I am are not too into it.  I can't blame them - just so you know what you're getting yourself into.
B000068CNX|5.0|The title of this review is just one of the great lines in the second season, or for that matter any season of Friends.  Friends is a unique show in that even when they have an episode that [stinks] compared to other Friends episodes, it is great compared to other shows.  I can say that I have never seen an episode I did not find enjoyable, especially this season. Joey moving out and eventually moving back in provide 3 hilarious episodes with Eddy, Chandlers new roommate.  There of course are the ones with Ross and Rachel getting together which are classics and partly the reason a lot of people even watch Friends.  Anyway, enough rambling, I have some Friends to watch.  You should too.
1587990717|5.0|Thought provocating, especially if you are in the trading / money mgt. biz, and have to live through risks everyday and yet would love to see big fat returns. I feel more humbled by being reminded that just being right is not everything - it may be pure survivorship bias. It's probably a guide to smart LT survival in the biz without risking being caught in &quot;game over&quot; scenario.
B000002GXX|5.0|Having listened extensively to every Eagles album, I think that One of These Nights is the deepest, as in the number of quality songs for one album.  There are very contrasting styles, such as an R&amp;B feel to &quot;One of These Nights&quot;, and a more country feel to &quot;Lyin' Eyes&quot;.  Still, the Eagles show on this album as good as any other that they are one of the best harmonizing groups ever.  Most of the songs of this album demostrate that they can bring all the vocal talents together in a blend that is good enough to showcase what they have, but not too over-the-top as to drown out each other or over-reach the material.  On &quot;Take It to the Limit&quot;, Randy Meisner shows that he can not only sing lead, but sound great doing it.  On many reviews I have read, not much attention is paid to the song &quot;Visions&quot;.  In my opinion it was one of the best Eagles songs ever recorded, because it is a very unique sound for the group at this time, and they pull it off greatly. &quot;Too Many Hands&quot; has Native American undertones, and &quot;After the Thrill is Gone&quot; is an excellent ballad, sung alternately by Henley and Frey.  The main thing that makes this album great is the fact that the Eagles focused on newer material and mastered it, as is evident with the contrasting songs on this album, and the outstanding job the band did on the majority of them.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|So happy to hear the DVD would be released of this most remarkable show. It is different than most of the Sci-Fi you are used to, but as I watched, I realized that it was the difference that set it apart and made it \\"thee best\\" show on the air. The cast is one of the best group of actors I've seen in ages. Their chemistry together was instant. Each one stood out and yet blended into the team. The stories were unique and thought provoking, and there was \\"so much left to tell\\".  The networks blew it big time in cancelling this show. Here's hoping the sales will be big enough to make them realize what a mistake they made. I want more! Buy this DVD set. You will not be disappointed. It is an instant classic. Joss Whedon put some real genius into this one. Firefly. Get it!
B000063UR2|5.0|If you watched the original American release of Legend and hated it (as I did) for all the plot holes and espescially the awful Tangerine Dream soundtrack, you owe it to yourself to give it another chance with the Ultimate Edition. This is Legend as Ridley Scott intended it to be. For starters, the original orchestral score has been restored... and it gives the movie a completely different tone. No longer does it seem cheesy and &quot;Willowish&quot;. Legend is transformed into a dark fantasy which will keep you on the edge of your seat. Better yet, many scenes which were cut from the original American release are now back in all their glory. We get alot more background on Jack and the Princess for example. Overall this movie ranks as a must have for any collection of fantasy films.
B00005V9HH|5.0|This film is part of the long line of Kevin Spacey films deserving of 5/5. The film is a terrific story with twists and surprises that will definitely keep viewers guessing. Although on repeat viewings, you will know what the surprises, it is still a fantastic movie because you can go back and see things you did not notice the first time.
0156027321|5.0|Absolutely fantastic story about a young Indian boy stranded on a life boat / raft with a 450 pound Bengal tiger for nearly one year in the Pacific Ocean. How, you may ask, could any author pull THAT off? You have simply got to read the book to believe it. It's one of the most amazing stories I have ever read, and it's a page turner, the kind that keeps you up at night, the ones that seem so rare these days. One word of caution: Definitely not for children or the faint of heart. Truly astounding.
0142000663|5.0|I felt that this book was amazing.  The story came to life as the characters traveled through hard times.  Not only did they work together physically, but they also used their minds to oversome the many obstacles they encountered on their journey.  It truly was an excellent read, and I encourage everyone to read it.
B000003TAR|5.0|While \\"Nevermind\\" still ranks as one of the most influential albums to grace mainstream, \\"In Utero\\" is a greater accomplishment. The clean sound of \\"Nevermind\\" fails to capture the grit and dirt that comes off this album. The recording style that Albini uses changes the way that Nirvana was heard. Microphones were placed everywhere, not just in the important spots, and Cobains voice was dubbed over and over to achieve the perfect sound. Even Cobain says that this album is Nirvana's greatest accomplishment.
0385504209|4.0|Outside of a night's sleep, some digressions to check Brown's facts against my copy of Chadwick's \\"Early Church\\" and some Google searches, I completed \\"The Davinci Code\\" straight through. The author took a fringe conjecture on the life of Christ and spun off a wonderful tale of suspense and international intrigue.<br />While I was completely absorbed by the backdrop of this story - theology, history, cryptology, Da Vinci's eccentricity, scheming Vatican, and secret societies - the foreground of this story was Good, but, in the end, wound up too neatly to be Great. It was as self-contained as a weekly TV drama series.<br />Regardless, I highly recommend for anyone enjoying history of modern religions, conspiracy theory, and in need of escape.
B000001FA4|5.0|U2's &quot;The Unforgettable Fire&quot; is one of the most versatile albums I have listened to, either in the car cruising down the highway or even while cleaning the home. From the very beginning of the stage-amicable &quot;Bad,&quot; which automatically offers an incredibly paenean sound to UF, and the retrospectively captivating ballad of &quot;Wire,&quot; to the eighth track, &quot;Indian Summer Sky,&quot; this album keeps you alive and desirous for more. It is impossible for these songs to become of hackneyed status as so many of the songs of the current music scene have accomplished, a majour justification in the apparent regression of such musical careers. <BR>  &quot;Elvis Presley in America,&quot; in a way, casts out the immortal presence of this album to a point with its pseudo-hydraulic vocals and musical accompaniment. However, &quot;MLK&quot; revives the spirit of UF with a comforting vocal enhancement to the additional instrumentation, providing a sound that puts the listener in a mystic aura of quietude.<BR>  Initially produced by the respected Eno/Lanois duo, this is a chef d'oeuvre in the eyes of many (including mine) and is most definitely the chocolate cake that is to be found in my collection. This is candy to the ears, mind, and soul. 1984 was a good year (or so, I've heard). All this album did was make it even betta. :)
B000005IU2|5.0|this album is a great peice of work from 1970. the singing is great and the stooges are at their prime.
6304698526|5.0|This is my favorite McQueen film because from beginning to end, he remains in character as Frank Bullitt, a taciturn but thorough police detective in San Francisco who relentlessly solves not one but several crimes. All of the supporting cast's performances are outstanding, notably those of Robert Vaughn (Walter Chalmers), Norman Fell (Baker), Don Ross (Delgetti) and Simon Oakland (Captain Bennett). Director Peter Yates introduced in this film a car chase which remains the industry standard, approximated by few others such as in The French Connection. The film is based on Robert L. Pike's novel Mute Witness. The key witness (allegedly Johnny Ross) is mute because he is dead. The central power play involves stoical Bullitt and careerist Chalmers. Bullitt is just doing his job whereas Chalmers has a political agenda which guides and informs his displeasure with Bullitt's unorthodox methods. As Bullitt's love interest Cathy, Jacqueline Bisset is only secondary to the plot which proceeds through moments of violence and strategic evasions before its ultimate resolution at the San Francisco International Airport. Also noteworthy is Robert Duvall's brief but indelible appearance as cab driver Weissberg. This film has Snap, Crackle, and Pop.
0790749815|5.0|This movie is frightfully good because it captures you into it. This happens with a good director, its like with a good book you don't want to put down. The movie is engrossing, even when you know the answers to questions you still get caught up in the mystery and allure of the film. The acting flows with the style of the film. The two actors fit well with the overall mood of the picture. It is a classic and provides adventure in a clever and stylish way. The films color is also top notch! Don't miss this great movie!<BR>Lisa Nary
B00009RDG9|2.0|Just how long can a once-great director coast along on his early-career reputation?  That's the question I found myself asking while watching \\"The Hunted,\\" the latest fiasco by William Friedkin, the renowned filmmaker who gave us \\"The French Connection\\" and \\"The Exorcist\\" thirty long years ago.  Is it possible to find another director who started out so promisingly and tanked so badly?  And, yet, somehow, because of the extraordinary quality of those two seminal films, his name still conjures up a great deal of respect and affection among action and horror film aficionados.<br />\\"The Hunted\\" is a bland, hopelessly run-of-the-mill, would-be thriller that asks the age-old question, \\"What happens when a man, who's been trained by the military to be a `killing machine,' suddenly goes off the reservation and starts eviscerating people he, through sheer paranoia, believes are up to something evil?\\" (it should be pointed out that this last aspect of the scenario is never very fully developed in the course of the film).  Benicio Del Toro plays Aaron Hallam, the psycho with nine lives (and seemingly nine hundred escape plans) who leads the FBI on a merry chase in and around Portland and its scenic environs.  Hot on his trail is Tommy Lee Jones as L.T. Bonham, the man who trained Hallam in the ways of killing and now has to find a way to put a stop to him before he can do more damage.<br />Del Toro and Jones are far too talented to be stuck in a vehicle such as this one, with Jones, in particular, looking tired and understandably baffled as to why he is still playing out variations on his \\"Fugitive\\" role ten years after the fact - even though, in this case, it is HE who finally gets to plunge over the waterfall into the roaring rapids below.  Maybe he's been waiting a decade to do that and saw this film as the perfect opportunity.  Hallam is so effective at dodging his pursuers and inflicting mega damage on all around him - while escaping unscathed himself, of course - that his character achieves all the truthfulness and plausibility of a Freddy Krueger knockoff.  And there is certainly enough splicing and dicing, flesh-cutting and bloodletting to fill a typical \\"Nightmare on Elm Street\\" installment.  Most of the stunt sequences are standard-issue and downright laughable, while the FBI, as usual, emerges as a bunch of incompetent hacks who can't even catch a single suspect while the object of their search is able to effectively dispose of a number of their finest agents armed with nothing more sophisticated than some well-honed hunting knives.  What is, perhaps, most dismaying about \\"The Hunted\\" is the fact that the script doesn't even try to put any kind of new spin on this old material.  The film is, literally, nothing more than a distended chase sequence with no interesting plot twists or character revelations to distinguish it from a hundred other films of a similar nature.<br />\\"The Hunted\\" also trivializes the kind of trauma soldiers suffer as a result of their experiences on the battlefield by showing yet another army veteran flipping out and committing wholesale slaughter once he's returned to civilian life.<br />As for Friedken, all I can say is that his glory days appear to be gone forever.  \\"The Hunted,\\" despite the pedigree of its director and the big names in its cast, is clearly the work of a hack.t his character achieves all the truthfulness and plausibility of a Freddy Krueger knockoff.

B0000630YA|5.0|Alice Cooper is my all time favorite singer EVER.  I have loved him since I was 12 years old, so maybe I'm a little biased, but I love this album just as much as I love the rest of his extensive catalog!  Alice's music adds a little bit of something different that sets it apart from everything else out there, which is what I love so much about him!  I highly recommend this as well as everything else that he puts out!!
0316666343|4.0|As a mother of three and a wife with a full time job, I somehow found time to read this book. My mother, who is not a big reader, bought it and read it in no time. She highly recommended it. So I started it yesterday and just finished it an hour ago. I was hooked on the first page! I thought it was an amazing idea for a novel, a murdered girl talking about her murder, her life before her murder and her family's life afterward as they tried to cope. I was not terribly thrilled with the ending, but in a way it was fitting. I am thinking about purchasing another book of Sebold's to see if it as well written. Enjoy!
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The highest grossing R rated movie in history, The Matrix: Reloaded is a combination of thinking man's sci-fi thriller and summer blockbuster...and against the odds it's a worthy sequel to boot.  Just as the Two Towers was to Fellowship of the Ring, Reloaded doesn't waste any time re-introducing characters or re-establishing the setup...it kicks off a scant 6 months after the end of the original Matrix, and hits the ground running.<br />The movie trilogy, for those who haven't noticed, represents the cycle of life...The Matrix was all about birth (Neo's awakening) and eventually The Matrix: Revolutions will mark death for either the humans or the machine army.  This middle chapter celebrates life in all its glory...hence that sweaty rave/sex scene that garnered so much misunderstanding from the critics.  I really enjoyed that transitional sequence, and to me it juxtaposed nicely with the newly freed Smith, and his brutal reproductive methods.  Actor Hugo Weaving steals every scene he's in with exceptional gravitas and presence, not to mention some great action set pieces.<br />It has to be said that if you're easily confused by all the techno-talky sections then this movie may come across as four or five fight scenes strung together with blah-blah-blah dialogue.  I think you either buy into this movie world or you don't, and non believers probably shouldn't apply.  IMBD's forum's for this movie are rife with people bickering over whether or not Neo could have beaten all those Smith's....it's a film guys, and you either like it or you don't.  And if you didn't then don't watch it again.<br />For us jack-in types however, I think this movie has given us some of the most artfully arranged and splendidly realised action sequences ever devised...its what would happen if Jackie Chan married Bruce Lee, and John Woo conducted the ceremony.<br />I defy those who said the movie lacked a sense of humor in its depiction of action and violence...one only has to turn to veteran actor Harold Perrineau for some great comedy timing, and indeed the whole film is underscored with comic-book irreverance. The strong cast keeps things ticking, with Keanu Reeves continuing to impress both physically and with his intensity and commitment to his role; he evens manages to raise a few smiles with his deadpan delivery. Stony-faced Carrie Ann Moss pulls off a few funny lines, and Monica Bellucci provides some pleasant eye-candy as the movie segues into its showdown action scene.<br />Throw in special effects that make Star Wars look dull (and I'm a SW fan as well) with a thumping soundtrack and this is a DVD that your home theatre will fall in love with.  Shake the halls of Zion, and buy this movie.n actor Harold Perrineau for some great comedy timing, and indeed the whole film is underscored with comic-book irreverance.

0060254920|5.0|I remember my teacher reading this to me in class. It was a great pleasure to read it to mine and they love it.
B00004VW35|5.0|I remember being vaguely disappointed with this one when it came out. But I'm durned if I can remember why. Hearing it on CD, I like it as well as I liked _Comes a Time_.<br />It's mostly traditional, straight-up country music, with the usual Neil twists (this time it's astronauts sitting around watching reruns of Muhammed Ali). The opening track -- a beautiful take on &quot;The Wayward Wind&quot; -- is the only track that Neil didn't write, and it's as lovely as &quot;Four Strong Winds&quot; on _Comes a Time_. The guest appearances by Waylon &amp; Willie are suitably understated. The songs are strong.<br />I honestly do not remember why I wasn't thrilled with this when it was first released. But whatever the reason, I was wrong, wrong, wrong.<br />I seem to recall that around the time this album was released, David Geffen sued Neil for putting out uncharacteristic and uncommercial music. Well, here's hoping Neil keeps that up forever.<br />Neil, I apologize for doubting you. I haven't got a _clue_ what I was thinking.

0553278398|5.0|Isaac Asimov never lost his touch. Like Heinlein, he devoted much of his late-period writing to wrapping all of his stories (robots, the Galactic Empire, and the Foundation(s)) into one grand Future History. Although I've long been primarily a Heinlein fan, I think Asimov did by far the better wrap-up job.<br />And when I go back to reread this stuff, I pick Asimov over Heinlein more often than not. I credit Heinlein with three absolutely magisterial novels (_Double Star_, _The Door into Summer_, and _The Moon is a Harsh Mistress_), a handful more that were really really good, and a boatload of third-tier stuff I don't care if I ever read again. (And in contrast to the Good Doctor, Heinlein's _non_fiction writings were uniformly awful. In real life Heinlein seems to have had something of a nasty side that I don't care for at all.)<br />On the whole, Asimov seems to be wearing better. And his more recent novels -- like this one -- are just plain excellent.<br />This one (and its followup, _Forward the Foundation_) is way more interesting than it has any right to be. For heaven's sake, we already _know_ how the Foundation stories come out. We know Hari Seldon doesn't get killed. We know he develops psychohistory. We know he establishes two Foundations at opposite ends of the Galaxy. There just shouldn't be a whole lot of tension here.<br />And with another author, there probably wouldn't be. But in Asimov's hands, the intrinsic interest of the story carries the day. We get a fascinating tour of Trantor, a lot of Imperial intrigue, some insights into the initial development of psychohistory, and a couple of the Good Doctor's closing twists (one of which will not be altogether unexpected if you know _Foundation's Edge_ and _Foundation and Earth_). It's extremely well done and pretty much unputdownable.<br />As of the mid-1960s or so, the field of SF has been dominated by writers with more style than substance. Asimov is still one of the three or four best and greatest.
B00005RY7X|4.0|I am excited about the release of &quot;the wolf&quot; tomorrow.  AWKs original album has been in my car CD player since i got it.  &quot;Party Hard&quot; and &quot;Fun Night&quot; are my 2 favorite..I have heard his new album and it seems to fill you up more than a hearty meal.

6302206294|4.0|Robin Hood has been filmed many times and this is a very ambitious attempt to give the story new dimensions, coupled with wonderful sceneries and lots of eye candy for everyone. Handsome men, beautiful Marian (Mastrantonio), huge, impressive castles, deep woods, fighting, loving, humour... And poor Kevin Costner, who is very cute and sympathetic - but uncomfortable with his part. <br />The story is familiar to us all, in this film it has an interesting addition with Robin as a prisoner during the crusades and his return to England with Azeem, the Great one, who must save his life to pay a debt. Although he likes to choose his moment... Morgan Freeman is very impressive as Azeem and gets some of the best lines, like when talking about mistletoe: &quot;In my country we don't drug women with plants. We talk to them.&quot; The manuscript has in fact many good lines - but Costner seems to drop all the opportunities of making himself memorable, when the sidekicks are having the time of their lives. Even fat friar Tuck seems to have more presence than the star of the movie. <br />This really isn't a bad movie, that's why I've given it four stars, although the third star goes to Freeman and the fourth to Rickman (the Sheriff on Nottingham). It's entertaining and has comedy and suspense and it's a feast for the eyes, but still it is a bit of a disappointment. Anyone who's done any acting or plans to act some day: this is how you let others steal the scenes even though they don't mean to. The film has two opposite examples of the use of energy and presence. Costner slouches through the film with so little energy that he actually lets everyone else shine at his own expense. Only with Mastrantonio or with the bow and arrow there is some charisma. On the other end there's Rickman's sheriff, bursting with energy right down to his fingers, every movement and raising of the eyebrows full of meaning. It's no wonder much of his work was cut off. Even in this version, he completely throws off the balance of the movie so that the audience waits for the sheriff's scenes, not Robin's. And which are the lines everyone remembers after the movie? &quot;And call of Christmas!&quot; &quot;I'll cut your heart out with a spoon!&quot; All sheriff's work, of course. Somewhere it was said, that Rickman has a conspiracy with the audience, as if saying: &quot;Let's have fun with this, so we can move on to doing something worth while after that.&quot; I thought it was very well put - and he certainly has a lot of fun. If you miss seeing more of him, get the new DVD, it's supposed to have some of scenes that were cut out, when the producers saw, what was happening to Costner - getting seriously shadowed by the villain.<br />Mastrantonio is a very beautiful Marian and works well with Costner, but doesn't seem to know, whether to fear or hate or loath the sheriff, so she does neither very convincingly. Although it must be difficult with sheriff's purring voice in one's ear... <br />It is a real pity, that much of good work done by other actors in smaller parts suffers from Costner's lack of interest in the movie, as it seems. But if you don't mind it, there's a lot of entertaining things to see and good performances - and several good lines, which make you think the writers had fun.
B00006BTCA|1.0|This CD was recomended to me because I am a huge Radiohead fan. At first listen, each song sounded strangely familiar to tunes I had heard before in the eighties and early nineties, which made me anticipate a catchy chorus- instead I was introduced to Interpol's lead signers 'voice', which is plain unlistenable. In the recent past, I cannot remember a voice that was so difficult to enjoy. Each song left me unsatisfied and just plain dissapointed. No wonder it was at a discounted price.
6305903182|2.0|Scream 3 stars david arquette and neve campbell once again and adds another stupid entry in the series which wasnt that great to begin with. The first Scream was so-so and ever since then it went downhill and makes the old time movies like halloween , nightmare on elm street series and friday the 13th look like masterpieces. I dont understand how you people can call this a masterpiece and say how good it is when it cant even compare to the older horror movies. Personally i think it sucked.
B00005JKES|5.0|What is everybody talking about when they say that the first episode is not on any of the DVD's in this series? I brought the series and on the first disk there is a pilot episode and the first episode, so what are these people on about about?! Anyway my advice on whether or not to perchase this DVD pack is that it is well worth the money! and will keep any Linch/Frost fan happy as it has four DVD's in it that keep one entertained for many hours and is a deffinent necessity that is needed to complete any good DVD collection.
B000000WA4|5.0|First off, let me say that The Smashing Pumpkins are my favourite band of all time. The first album I ever bought was Siamese Dream, and I have almost everything they ever put out. I'm not a crazy Billy Corgan maniac, but this 28 song, double CD is an amazing album from start to finish. Every song on here has its own mood and personality. It has become the best selling double CD of all time, and I believe, it is the absolute best double CD ever made (and I am taking into account The White Album and The Wall, among others).<br />The concept of the album is quite simple, but it makes the CD much more enjoyable. The idea behind it is that this is what a teenager might go through in a day (hence the CD names Dawn to Dusk and Twilight to Starlight). A lot of people have criticized Corgan for the writing in these songs, but they're not about him. They're about teenage angst.<br />The Pumpkins have been known for their mastery of the loud-soft music style, and it shows on this album. Tonight, Tonight, a fairly soft song is followed up by the rocking Jellybelly. The acoustic Stumbleine is followed up by X.Y.U., which in turn is followed up by We Only Come Out at Night.<br />Overall, there is not an even remotely bad song on here (althought Tales of a Scorched Earth is the weakest track). If you haven't picked up this album yet, you have no idea what you're missing.
B00005JLXE|2.0|Really not even remotely as good as everybody makes it sound. The story is not deep at all, no substacne to it and really just another comicbook story. Nothing to see hear, nothing worth raving about, not worth buying, but not a complete waste of time either.
0800141660|5.0|One of my all time favorite movies. Even if you are unfamiliar with Jane Austen's work, as I was, you will still love this movie. Emma Thompson did a brilliant job on the screenplay. The direction is wonderful and the cast is absolutely stellar. Kate Winslet's performance as Marianne is truly heartbreaking. I can't say enough about it.
0312265859|5.0|I love Evanovich's books!! I have been a fan since she was writing those little romance series books. Great humor with quirky characters. And in the middle of all the action is this great male/female thing.  Will she or wouldn't she? Stay tuned!!
B00005J9LZ|5.0|The Pet Shop Boys made a bit of a splash with their first album 'Please', and their greatest hit song from that album, 'West End Girls' remains the classic Pet Shop Boys song, but it took 'Actually' to establish the duo as a group with credibility and staying power. With this album, the Pet Shop Boys became one of the major groups of the 1980s.<br />The songs on this album are ironic, witty, urbane--all things would not normally associate with pop/dance music. And, surprisingly, none of this intellectual content seems to interfere with the beat and bop as crowds bounce around on the dance floor.<br />The magnum opus of this album is probably the collaborative effort the Pet Shop Boys did with Dusty Springfield, entitled 'What Have I Done to Deserve This?' This song showcased Dusty, who had been neglected for years by the music establishment, and brought attention to both Dusty and the Pet Shop Boys as being able to reach just a bit further than anyone had previously realised.<br />The song 'It's a Sin' was a song very much in tune with the hedonistic, decadent London (and New York/California) nightlife, capturing the bittersweet flavour of life on the wild side. Of course, this was also the 'don't ask-don't tell coming out' song for the Boys (more than a decade before they would 'officially' come out), but then, their music reached different levels so that this never was that much of an issue (people variously heard and didn't hear what they wanted to hear in this song). The Roman Catholic Church even asked Neil Tennant to comment in one of their sectarian magazines, remarking that 'no one talks about sin any more'. Rather reminds me of the US Navy opting to use the Village People's 'In the Navy' for recruiting before realising the undertones (or perhaps, overtones, in their case).<br />Shortly after this album was completed, the Pet Shop Boys did their one-and-only feature film (and may we be spared from such an experiment in the future). It went on for much too long with contrived scenes and no real plot, trying too self-consciously to be artistic and pop-culture-accessible at the same time, weaving together songs (that are subtle and hard to characterise in the first place) into a pastiche of events that didn't flow well.<br />After this album also, the Pet Shop Boys began their habit of doing a remake after each major album--in this case, it was 'Always on My Mind', a high-tempo pull-out-all-the-stops disco version that remained popular in dance clubs for years, and can still fill the floor on most nights.<br />In all, if you were to have only one Pet Shop Boys album, opt for Discography. However, if you have room in your collection for two, include this one. The minor songs ('Rent', which was popular in Europe and Japan but not America; 'King's Cross'; 'It couldn't happen here') are great and worth a hearing.ng with contrived scenes and no real plot, trying too self-consciously to be artistic and pop-culture-accessible at the same time, weaving together songs (that are subtle and hard to characterise in the first place) into a pastiche of events that didn't flow well. <br />After this album also, the Pet Shop Boys began their habit of doing a remake after each major album--in this case, it was 'Always on My Mind', a high-tempo pull-out-all-the-stops disco version that remained popular in dance clubs for years, and can still fill the floor on most nights.<br />In all, if you were to have only one Pet Shop Boys album, opt for Discography.

B000060OFT|5.0|If you like IKEA, if you're into pomo, if you know that Romeo and Juliet is not a book, but a play, you'll probably dig this remake.  Absolutely hilarious and dramatic, from romeo and &quot;his boys,&quot; to guns named &quot;dagger,&quot; to ecstasy being the main cause of the lover's inital attraction, this is a great interpretation.  Yes, it is in Shakesperian English, and yes, it rocks.
1570429596|5.0|I thought this book was very interesting.  I had seen the writer on tv a while ago, but didn't buy the book, I bought it on recommendation from a friend who said it was very good.<br />I have found it very interesting, though since most people are living in debt and are so far from having any type of money to invest in anything, I think this book caters only to those who are in a position to invest some money.<br />I personally thought it was a fantastic book, very thought provoking and helpful to my own mindset, but only if you are looking for investment advice and to change your thought pattern about money, if you are looking for a book on how to get out of debt and how to manage your money etc... I think Suze Orman would be a better choice.

B00005JKN9|2.0|Maybe the portrayal of NY in the 1800's was accurate, but still very poorly done.  The movie lacks credibility.  I had a hard time sitting through it.  No one character engages the viewer; and no coherent theme emerges.  Chaotic and busy...not one that I recommend.
B0000648WZ|5.0|Although widely panned when it was released, Starship Troopers is much more than meets the bloody eye. Popular today largely for its ultra-violence and often campy teen soap opera qualities, it was actually designed by its director Paul Verhoeven to recall the sorts of recruiting propaganda movies used throughout the 20th century to convince young people that joining the military was a glamorous, heroic adventure rather than a ticket to senseless slaughter. His characters are almost stereotypically shallow and beautiful -- more like 90210 cast members than soldiers -- specifically to paint a picture of the bloody war they fight as a patriotic struggle of good and evil instead of the disastrously murderous campaign it really is. Verhoeven's future world is a reasonable representation of Heinlein's benign fascist society and his clever use of every trick in the propagandist's repetoire easily masks the underlying lack of freedoms and civil rights their society has if the audience isn't careful. In fact, in our post-911 world Verhoeven's security state is almost intoxicating in its glossiness and simple-minded fixation with duty, obedience and patriotism. The brilliance of the director's subtle message struck me most when I first saw this movie in the theater. In the row in front of me sat two kids essentially the same age as the film's protagonists and as the credits rolled one of them nearly shouted to the other: \\"Damn! I wish I could join up right now!\\"<br />If this film doesn't make you wonder why you want to join those kids and kill bugs you aren't paying attention.
B00005JLTN|2.0|I thought the sequal was a disappointment due to the fact that it doesn't catch your attention or give you a thrill of excitement as the first one did. I'll give credit to the action scenes especially the big car chase scene but other than those points i have to say was uninteresting and boring so i recommend this to fans of the matrix series only.
B000002UJQ|1.0|Anyone who thinks that this album is in any way innovative, experimental or avant-garde needs to stop trying to impress people with how cool they are and instead listen to anything by Fantomas, Mr Bungle, Thinking Plague, Porcupine Tree, Opeth, or Spiral Architect. THAT is progressive, innovative, groundbreaking music. This is just easy listening pop that ignorant posers think is avant-garde just because it doesn't sound like Britney Spears. Well, people, expand your horizons a little and move outside the mainstream. This album is about as innovative as Muzak.
B00005JKLZ|3.0|After reading some of the reviews I felt I had to say something. Sci fi is not about special effects, it is about thinking about things in a different way.  This movie failed to do that and seemed more like a forced Pollitical Correctness preach peppered with a monster head-bashing fest for distraction much like every other movie these days.  So really your just counter dictiong what H. G. Well's original story was all about.  Our minds and indeed our crainiums have shrunk in recent years(as medical profiles and IQ tests will show it's a fact) Generation Y is less intelligent(by a margin) than Gen X and so on and thier attention spans is considerably less. Just as Wells predicted. Gen Z(or whatever) will move even closer to the Eloi, which in the book are portraid as pretty weak and dumb(with no common sense either).  though most people couldn't handle that in a movie like this.<br /> H. G.'s grandson must have a rebellious streak. With this movie the Drama was severely lacking as well sci-fi being totally out of the picture period.  The characters were believable but uninspiring.  I don't think the &quot;Time Traveler&quot; should take responsiblity for everything, like the Samantha Mumba character(Weena equivilent) and all the eloi keep preaching to him.  That's just another echo of our own modern scociety saying that &quot;My problems are becasue of YOU.&quot;  It's just plain rude!  800,000 A D will not be a world of nay sayers, becasue no one will know what a time traveler is all about. If I were an Eloi I would be more concerned about saving my skin than preaching the morals of 2002.<br />If you want a good movie skip this garbage and go for the Rod Taylor version. If your a Time Machine Freak, get the Limited ED DVD, but If you want to be truely enlightened, READ THE BOOK!!!<br />Oddly enough my Dad at 63, whose twice my age liked this movie more than I did. But not much more.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|As a long time Maiden fan, having enjoyed but not been totally convinced by 2000`s &quot;Brave new world&quot;, I was confident that Harris, Dickinson would deliver the goods after the &quot;first album back&quot; settling in period that followed their 1998 reformation.  Even I have been left stunned by the quality of what`s on offer here.  The depth and breadth of material in this new offering blows away their entire 90`s output and buries memories of low points like &quot;From here to eternity&quot; or &quot;The angel and the gambler&quot;.<br />First up is &quot;Wildest dreams&quot; , the single from the album, which, when I first heard it I thought &quot;typical Maiden-by-numbers song&quot;.  It is, but it serves as a prelude to the rest of the album which is ALL a lot stronger.  Sure, there are plenty of usual styled rockers like &quot;Rainmaker&quot;, &quot;Gates of tomorrow&quot; and &quot;New frontier&quot; but the playing and production matched to top quality writing make these far more memorable than anything since their Eighties heyday.  Here, the band seem to have finally ironed out the three guitar concept with lead lines and counter melodies flying in from everywhere.<br />The real standouts, as with any Maiden album, are the epics.  The first to catch my ear was &quot;Montsegur&quot;.  This is Maiden at their bombastic, swash-buckling best.  Bruce singing full-tilt over a heavy, yet melodic, rhythm with a totally unbelievable, and unflustered, time change in the instrumental section.  This ranks amongst their greatest ever recordings.  &quot;Dance of death&quot; is a bit like &quot;The Clansman&quot; and &quot;Blood brothers&quot; with a celtic influenced melody which does invoke memories of Spinal Tap`s &quot;Stonehenge&quot; in the middle section.  However, such is the drama of the song and the straight faced delivery, you won`t even think about it more than once.  Had this been Dio...well!  The sombre &quot;Pachendale&quot; is all about the first world war trench battle.  This is the accumulation of Steve Harris` attempts to write a classic anti war song,  having come so close with &quot;Afraid to shoot strangers&quot; and &quot;The Aftermath&quot;, he finally delivers the goods with help from co-writer Adrian Smith.  It`s Maiden, only heavier and darker, perhaps how &quot;The X Factor&quot; could have sounded with a better producer and singer.  Final track &quot;Journeyman&quot; is a total departure,  being accompanied by an orchestra while the electic guitars are replaced by acoustics.  This is the only place this track could have appeared, at the end of the album, with Bruce lamenting about how all things must pass.  It`s a spectacular ending.<br />The expectation of this album brought back memories of a time when each Maiden LP release was an event in itself and it is good that they have given us a killer.  In a time when Metallica et all try so hard to get away from their roots and release noise for the sake of music,  it is reassuring that a band can stay true to what they do and still sound fresh and exciting.

0151003084|5.0|This little book is macabrely funny and delightfully bizarre. From the Mary-Poppins like pose of the skeleton undertaker on the cover to the 26 little tomestones on the back, this book tells the story of the improbable demise of a small child for every letter of the alphabet. A wonderful gothic parody.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|After hearing such trash and dribble this summer from METALLICA'S ST. GARBAGE album, it's still great to know that there is at least one classic metal band that doesnt keep trying to re-invent themselves and does what they want to do. Iron Maiden are simply the finest musicians in the business today and DANCE OF DEATH proves that once again.<br />Three years ago I was excited to learn the boys were back and BRAVE NEW WORLD just blew me out of the water. To this day I have not stopped listening to that album. There is something that is so haunting about it and I thought for sure that IRON MAIDEN would never be able to top it.<br />I was wrong.<br />DANCE OF DEATH takes BRAVE NEW WORLD to the next level and the some. When the final track JOURNEYMAN is done turning at 7 minutes and 6 seconds, you will feel the same. Any MAIDEN fan knows that IRON MAIDEN doesnt write meaningless songs. Each piece in itself is is layered with so many levels and strikes a rich chord within. With each album we expect at least one or two great epic songs, (RIME OF THE ANCIENT MARINER, GHOST OF THE NAVIGATOR, ALEXANDER THE GREAT) and DOD gives us FOUR (MONTSEGUR, DANCE OF DEATH, PASCHENDALE, and JOURNEYMAN)!!! The first track, WILDEST DREAMS, is fast and catchy. I saw them this summer on GIVE ME ED 'TIL I'm DEAD and this is the song they opened with. I absolutely loved it! The album has its share of fast Maiden-esk songs and towering scores that make this album worth every penny. There is not one throw away song worth skipping through to get to the next track. DANCE OF DEATH is layered with 11 tracks that run two seconds shy of 68 minutes. <br />WILDEST DREAMS - 3:52<BR>RAINMAKER - 3:48<BR>NO MORE LIES - 7:21<BR>MONTSEGUR - 5:50<BR>DANCE OF DEATH - 8:36<BR>GATES OF TOMORROW - 5:12<BR>NEW FRONTIER - 5:04 Written by Nicko McBrain, AWESOME TRACK!<BR>PASCHENDALE - 8:27<BR>FACE IN THE SAND - 6:31<BR>AGE OF INNOCENCE - 6:10<BR>JOURNEYMAN - 7:06  <br />If you are a new or old MAIDEN fan, get this album, learn it, live it, and get ready for the tour next year. DANCE OF DEATH is simply amazing!!!!!!! UP THE IRONS!!!!!!!!
0375703764|2.0|A big disappointment, and no horror classic despite what the blurb (and it's narrator Johnny Truant) would have you believe. As a stylist, Danielewski is painfully limited and awkward. Which is a shame, as the central premise of the house's nightmarish 'underworld' is highly original and unnerving, but the author is never able to really put fire in the belly of his creation.<BR>Equally Danielewski's inability to make enough of the book's myriad diversions and off-shoots engaging or interesting undermines the whole undertaking at a structural level, and the reader is likely to start skipping increasingly large sections. The pseudo-academic analyses that pepper the narrative are tedious and pretty unconvincing, although allowances must be made for the equally bogus nature of American pseudo-academia that he is satirising.  Johnny Truant does become a more engaging narrator towards the end, but his sense of increasing terror and paranoia is never really convincing, or, crucially, becomes at all throat-clutching for the reader. The ending of the main (Navidson) story is jarringly conventional given what has been conjured up before; you can be forgiven for feeling that hidden beneath all the flashy encrustations, the author had a fine idea that he ultimately found himself unable to really run with.
B000054OXU|3.0|...sigh, what can i say. i bought this one with no no optimism towrds it. and i was partly right. this is definitly an example of why 80's neil isn't as popular as the 70's or 90's neil. the synthesizers are a bit overused and the songs kind of drone on. but in a way, thats a good thing. something about all the boys choir creeped me out. but hippie dream is definitly a gem. i got a problem is also a more then decent rocking song. touch the night is horribly done, but im in no way saying its a bad song. ive heard a live version of it, and its nearly like a hurricane quality.<BR>   bottom line: if your going to buy one 80's neil album, buy Freedom. but if you buy two, buy Landing on Water.
B000003TA4|5.0|I think even 20 years from now, Nirvana will be known to at least 2/3s of all people who have listened to anything other than mainstream pop. I dont feel this album is overrated at all, like I saw some others write. Although it was majorly commercial when it was released, the album is very good and the ultimate grunge album to own.<br />&quot;Smells like Teen Spirit&quot; is a rock stadium, angst teenagers hit, but very catchy and with alot of emotionally satisfaction.<br />&quot;In Bloom&quot; was also a hit with mainstream, and a good follow up to &quot;Smells..&quot;<br />&quot;Come as You Are&quot;. Another hit. You may think by now that, &quot;Yeah, its a bunch of mainstream hoot-nanny that I am too good to listen to.&quot; Not so. A slower song, and very memorable. Although my least favorite of its singles.<br />&quot;Breed&quot; is one of my least favorites on the album. I sense they lost some of the energy of the album here, but thats ok, because the next track &quot;Lithium&quot; is one of the best. This song is a fan favorite and is a total Kurt song. You can really feel emotion flowing through your speakers on this one. <br />&quot;Polly&quot; &quot;Territorial Pissings&quot;, and &quot;Drain You&quot; are very well written and &quot;Drain You&quot; is a classic, and fan fav. as well. <br />I'll now skip to the last track, &quot;Something In The Way&quot; which may just be Nirvana's best song. With a mellow cello playhing in the back its the end of the suicide note called &quot;Nevermind&quot;. Very dark, depressing, and a great album closer. Unexpected, too. You just need to hear it. There is also a hidden track of sorts at the end, which is even more anger filled than all the tracks on here. A suprise ending to a great album.<br />4.5/5 stars...
B000003TBP|5.0|The best word to describe &quot;Odelay&quot; is diverse, or eclectic. On this album along with all his others, he either sings soulfully, delivers a beautiful ballad, raps, you name it. To add to that, you have Beck's wide love for music spread all over the album. Not one song is the same. One minute you're hearing alternative rock, the other hip-hop, the other country, blues, funk, folk... the list goes on. Spice it up with some heavily experimental blasts of noise and, of course, Beck-humor, and you've got a work of art that most definitely keeps you listening the whole time. Not to mention enjoy every insane, classic second. Plus, the album sleeve is so awesome. Get it.
B000002UJQ|5.0|I have a deep and emotional attachment to this album.  I have listened to all of the great albums of the past and this one will go down in history among them.  I hope others can read this and other reviews and experience the album for themselves.  It changed my life.
B000089CJI|5.0|This album makes me want to dance in a wheat field somewhere in Northern Ontario.  Is that wrong?  This is a gorgeous meeting of the minds.  Flavours of Future Bible Heroes, Stars, and of course the remarkable beauteous sounds of Death Cab for Cutie and Dntel.  More, more, more.  Please.
B00003CXTG|2.0|\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is an action-packed, highly entertaining historical drama that tries as hard as it can to get it right. But be warned that in order to enjoy this film, you have to endure all of its clichés and historical inaccuracies or simply fast-forward past them as I wound up doing.<br />LOVE STORY<BR>First and foremost, \\"Pearl Harbor\\" is a love story, or as one witty viewer put it, \\"Two guys love one woman and-oh-incidentally, some ships get bombed in Pearl Harbor.\\" The two guys in question are childhood friends, Rafe (Ben Affleck), and Danny (Josh Hartnett), who grow up to be fighter pilots and fall in love with the same navy nurse, (Kate Beckinsale). The film begins promisingly enough with the boys standing on Rafe's farm admiring his father's crop dusting maneuvers, joyfully oblivious to the toxic pesticides wafting down upon them from the sky. A few years later, the boys have grown up to be fighter pilots training for a war that everyone knows will inevitably reach American soil and borrowing the tower buzzing plot device from \\"Top Gun\\". Rafe is the first to fall in love with the pretty naval nurse but when he is presumed dead after getting shot down over the English channel, his best friend and his paramour become an item. But Rafe manages to return home alive and suddenly the three principle characters are caught in a dilemma of who loves whom and who love whom even more. It's an interesting scenario, but unfortunately, the film takes the sentimental and campy route. You may feel differently but I had to fast forward past all of the dialog between Rafe, Danny, and the nurse. It wasn't hard to guess what they were saying to each other anyway. In case you think I'm being too harsh, it might help to keep in mind that the film makers ran various love scenarios by focus groups to see what would outcome would most likely appeal to audiences. In other words, they're trying to play you.<br />WAR MOVIE<BR>\\"Pearl Harbor\\" is an awesome war movie from a visual perspective but contains some of the most wretched lines in cinema (I just want to matter). For anyone who enjoyed \\"Saving Private Ryan\\",this film is a must see. The battle scenes, particularly the aerial combat scenes and the bombing of Pearl Harbor, and the launching of B-25 Mitchels from the carrier U.S.S. Hornet are astounding. Be warned however, that the raid on Pear Harbor is simply painful to watch. The film captures the carnage and the tragedy of sinking ships as well as sailors getting burned, strafed, bombed, and drowned with gut wrenching precision (some of which it lifts from \\"Private Ryan\\"). It's both difficult and fascinating to watch and you will definitely come out of it with renewed compassion for survivors of Pearl Harbor and other acts of illegal military aggression. <br />The film also does an admirable job of presenting the dangers and difficulties of America's counter attack against Tokyo, using carrier born B-25 bombers. Unfortunately, this too is mired by melodrama, and the presence of Rafe and Danny.<br />HISTORICAL DRAMA<BR>Here's where the film tries to get it right and rarely succeeds. I commend Director Michael Bay for trying to portray the Japanese and in a humane and objective manner. In one scene the Japanese high command reveals that the U.S. oil embargo against Japan has left it with only enough fuel to power its war machine for eighteen more months, essentially amounting to a military death sentence. The film also credits Admiral Husband Kimmel for his awareness of Pearl Harbor's vulnerability and his ill-fated attempts to protect it. <br />It is worth noting, however, that the film botches the historical record in a few vital areas. At one point, an earnest naval intelligence officer announces that the Japanese fleet could easily be tracked if only the Americans could break their naval code. Actually, America did break that code as early as 1929 but for reasons that historians still debate today, that intelligence was never made available to Admiral Kimmel. In another scene the American executive government announces that it must cannibalize the Pacific fleet in order to send more equipment to the beleaguered British forces in Europe. Nope-sorry-but that is incorrect in two respects. First, prior to Pearl Harbor, Roosevelt launched an aggressive new ship-building program that would have completed one hundred new naval vessels by 1943. In addition, the pacific fleet was not cannibalized as the film suggests, but as a matter of luck or deliberate human intervention, its best ships including all aircraft carriers were on maneuvers in the Pacific during the raid on Pearl Harbor. As horrible as the losses were on that day, the damage in military terms could have been much worse. In fact, most of the ships that were sunk in Pearl Harbor on December 7th, 1941 were WW I relics. This doesn't mean the film deliberately lies when in fact it draws on popular historiography of Pearl Harbor. But if you want a more accurate picture of what happened and why, there are several good books available (\\"Day of Deceit\\", \\"At Dawn We Slept\\", and \\"The Emperor's Codes\\") as well as great film, \\"Tora Tora Tora\\". <br />PATRIOTIC HOMAGE<BR>Of course \\"Pearl Harbor\\" can't help but end with ten minutes worth of patriotic verbiage reminding us how it's always important to suspect foreign countries of evil intentions and to go to war whenever we feel like it, because things would have worked out pretty well if we did so then. I think history and politics are more complex than that but I understand why the filmmakers inserted unnecessary flag waving material in the end. This was one of the sections I wound up skipping over. <br />CONCLUSION<BR>Masterful visual effects aside, this film will not teach anyone a thing about Pearl Harbor. While it may not be as flashy, I highly recommend \\"Tora Tora Tora\\" for its far more intelligent, inclusive, and objective portrayal of Pearl Harbor. Again, you may want to mute or fast-forward your waythrough the wretched dialog of this one.
B0000931OG|4.0|They may have lost their lead guitarist but they haven't lost soul. Blur's latest LP, Think Tank refreshes old tricks and brings new hooks to create a great Brit-Pop album. The tracks range from mellow melodical tunes like &quot;Out of Time&quot; to white knuckle rock riffed tracks like &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; to beat ridden, effects laiden songs like &quot;On My Way To The Club.&quot; It's obvious that singer Damon Albarn quite enjoyed his work on his side project &quot;The Gorillaz.&quot; It shows on Think Tank. It spans from rock to pop to hip hop to eastern style Arabic-like music. With the absence of their lead guitarist they make-up for it with driving bass-lines (like in the nearly instrumental pounding &quot;Jets&quot;) and bizzare sound effects (like in the Song 2ish &quot;Crazy Beat&quot;). Blur is back and ready to rock the house, or club, or whatever. 8/10 Highlights: &quot;Crazy Beat&quot; &quot;Out of Time&quot; &quot;On My Way To The Club&quot; &quot;Battery in Your Leg&quot; &quot;Jets&quot;
0893860220|5.0|Sri Nisargadatta's words will make your busy mind come to a screeching halt. This is the only book of his I've read, but theres a good chance I'll check some of his others out. This book is a very good tool for most seekers on the spiritual path.
0780622553|4.0|**Spoilers** This was a great movie to watch.  It has a tight storyline but it is not groundbreaking (Metropolis, Lost Children).  The acting is very well done. Connely always seems so genuine in her roles.  Watching this, I was astounded by the similarities with The Matrix.  I know this movie came out only about 15 months earlier than The Matrix so it is more than likely a coincidence.  The scene with the Doctor calling Murdoch and telling him that \\"they\\" are coming for him (and later once they meet,  the doctor is wanting to show him how to harness his special gift to control the machine).  The stranger that jumps down on the rooftop and approaches saying, \\"Mr. Murdoch\\" in the same exact tone as \\"Mr Anderson\\", from Agent Smith.  That our hero is able to fly by the end of the movie and is able to stop a dagger that is throw at his face with his mind.  Too strange (and those are just a few examples, the entire premise is very close).  There is also a scene with Jennifer Connely standing on the end of a pier on the ocean that is almost the exact scene from Requiem for a Dream, same actress and everything.  Requiem was directed by Darren Aronofsky who also made Pie, also about chaos theory and the spirals that make up the universe.  Too odd!  This is a very well done film from an art direction standpoint and I would not doubt that it has influenced others. I just wonder if the Wachowski brothers somehow got their hands on an early script.
B000002H33|5.0|MoP: THE metal album! Riding the fame of the lightning (xcuse the pun) Metallica had two years to put out a worthy successor. RTL had made them a household name amongst metal fans, and the band delivered the very best in their most influential album of hteir career.<br />Metallica's masterpiece is pure metal at its best: starting with BATTERY, the group mixes acoustic intros with their bludgeoning riffola and thrashy, ear-popping sound! <BR>The title track is probably the fans' favourite track-melodic solos and verses, trademark Metrallica riffs and an all round quality that few can match, this track stands out as the album's bright flame.<br />Delivering more thrash with LEPPER MESSIAH, DISSPOSABLE HEROES, THE THING THAT SHOULD NOT BE and DAMAGE INC metallica stay true to their metal origins and manage to make 4 original and interesting songs that are the meat of the album.<br />ORION stands out as the best instrumental in their career, with a catchy riff and a melodic and spacey (hence the name) middle. WELCOME HOME (SAANITARIUM) on the other hand is the most balladic song on hte album with a slow acoustic beginning, followed by...you guessed it, real metal.<br />Every self-respecting metal fan should own this album, which features songs centred on power and war and the government's attitude to soldiers (DISPOSABLE HEROES, MASTER OF PUPPETS).<BR>The bible of garage bands everywhere and inspiration for thousnads of guitarists around the world, MoP is worth you money!<br />BUY!BUY!BUY!
0609610570|5.0|Wonderfull and fresh book that focuses on execution, this book brings a new a fresh spirit that good executional capabilities is a must for any companies who want to be great winners. Good writing and deep thinking. I read this together with Escape Velocity, a book by a former Mckinsey strategy consulant Idris Mootee, and I begin to think from how stratety is formulated to how it gets executed. Both books are excellent read.
B00007BK2N|5.0|I love this movie!<BR>Steve Coogan is absolutely hilarious in his delivery and angst when dealing with that guy who refers to \\"Brian Martin\\" and \\"George Epstein.\\"  The look of irritance on his face is classic, as is his incredibily polite request to the girl when he's in the back of the van.  \\"Thank You!\\"<BR>What is the best, however, is the emphasis the movie places on Joy Division, clearly one of the most influential and best bands ever to come out of England (or anywhere else for that matter).  The actor playing Ian Curtis was excellent and you feel the emotion of him especially in the scene where they're driving around in the car listening to the recording of \\"She's Lost Control.\\"  When they focus on him and the film changes to black and white there is the sense of the dread he felt at success.  I note that the soundtrack to the movie includes the excellent song Ceremony, which was omitted from the movie itself, as far as I could tell.  A great song that deserved more attention, even if it was recorded with Sumner on vocals, not Curtis.  The soundtrack also has the song \\"Temptation,\\" which is the best song New Order ever released, in my opinion.  I don't recall this being in the movie, either.<BR>I thought there was too much of the Happy Mondays in the movie, although they were a great band as well, though I never knew Shaun Ryder was such a jerk.   What about The Stone Roses, Inspiral Carpets, Charlatans UK, Northside, 808 State, etc?  Didn't they all play at the Hacienda as well during this time?<BR>A great movie all in all.   Highly recommended.<BR>Oh, in the scene at the Hacienda where no one's there and the one guy finishes his set and comes to talk to Wilson, is that supposed to be Billy Bragg?  Sort of looked like him, yeah?
0066620996|5.0|Wonderfull and an excellent piece of work. With a lot of current business books calling for a new simplicity and return to basics, this book brings a new a fresh spirit to how businesses can find inspiration and ideas that can be great winners. Great writing and great thinking. This book should be read together with Escape Velocity by Idris Mootee, a former Mckinsey consultant, in his book provided a journey through the develpment of business strategy. Put all those theories in perspectives and put them in context of those companies that Jim provided in this book...a lot of amazing discoveries.
0553350005|4.0|Also published as \\"Ten Little Indians\\", Agatha Christie's classic mystery is still one of my favorites. Ten people come to a remote island, all vaguely invited under false pretenses. With their hosts nowhere to be seen, they have a quiet dinner until a disembodied voice accuses each of them of murder. Of course, everyone claims innocence, but when the guests begin to die one by one, the accusations seem to have some merit. And they can only conclude that there is a true murderer in their midst. This mystery is a fantasy about the art of crime, and is one of Christie's more famous ones. It may not be her best book, but it is quite a delightful tale.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I can't get this cd out of my stereo. It never happened to me before. Thrown Down alone is worth the purchase price.<BR>You know Mac. This is sterling Mac. Even if we are in 2003.<BR>Trust me and buy it.
B000062XM7|5.0|I've never understood why most Americans overlook this film in favor of the more deliberately 'mind-blowing' violence of medieval epics such as Braveheart and The Two Towers, and I say that as a lover of medieval legends (not so much Braveheart, since Mel Gibson's film takes too many liberties with my ancestor Robert the Bruce)... In fact, when I first saw this film in the theaters in 1992, I said to myself, &quot;this is American myth. This is how the great 'historical' legends should be filmed.&quot; <br />And amazingly, given all the historical epics that have followed it, MOHICANS remains on top. <BR>Closer to David Lean or Kurosawa than Mel Gibson or Peter Jackson.  <br />It's a pity, really, that this &quot;high-romance&quot; style of epic film-making didn't catch on again.  Although there are glimmers of it in recent films such as /Pirates of the Caribbean/ and in the first /Rings/ flick.  I guess those who weren't turned off by the frank depiction of violence were disappointed by Michael Mann's tasteful depiction of it... and his focus on drama, romance and tragedy.  It's a, well, tragedy that it has been overlooked by the descendants of the settlers and frontiersmen that are eulogized in this great film.<br />Another tragedy is that like many releases, DVD has proven to be a double-edged sword for the art of editing classic films.  The superior theatrical VHS version of &quot;Last of the Mohicans&quot; which some of you know and love so well may soon itself become, well, as endangered as Chingachgook's people.  To put it another way:<br />   &quot;Great Spirit and the maker of all life:  <BR>    An inferior DVD edition goes into the trash bin, <BR>    as swift and straight as an arrow shot into the sun.<br />    Let a true widescreen, theatrical cut of the movie take its <BR>    place alongside the classic, unedited VHS titles that still <BR>    remain on the convenience store shelf of my people. <BR>    For they are all gone now, but one: <BR>    The original version of Last of the Mohicans.&quot;<br />    * * * * *<br />(A slightly expanded version of this speech is the only positive addition to the aptly yclept Director's CUT, on the DVD edition.  And even that is questionable, since it's unclear what Russell Means is saying about Indians and settlers &quot;dying out&quot; and being replaced by others. After all, while Chingachgook's fictional band and countless real peoples were exterminated in the wake of 1757,<BR>the real Mohicans survived and are doing just fine, thank you.)<br />Buy the VHS version today.  If you don't have a video player, rent the DVD edition, but do not buy it. It's just not as good.  For a film this great and well-edited, there's a difference.  Especially for lovers of the original soundtrack.  Wait for the real version of this classic movie to come out, with extras.  <br />Or better yet:   Get a VHS/DVD Combo video player... and buy the VHS Widescreen Theatrical Edition <BR>before it goes the way of Hawk-eye and Uncas.<br />       * * * * *<br />Interesting side-note: Does Mann have some &quot;issues&quot;, or is he overly fond of the 1936 version of the tale?  In the books, which are admittedly TURGID but worth reading, there's alot more of the &quot;legendary&quot; Robin Hood-style element (Hawk-eye's unnatural marksmanship with a flintlock, etc.)  <br />But there's ALSO a lot more going on with the interracial romance angle between Uncas and Alice (some of which Mann edited OUT of the DVD - another reason not to get it.) And Cora was actually Creole in the book, but not in the movie. And Russell Means' elaboration on the fictional demise of the Mohicans at the end of the &quot;extended&quot; DVD is not as fiery as you'd expect. When did blue-eyed, fair-skinned protagonists become &quot;safer&quot; than the original classic source material?  Oh well... it would've been a different film.
B000002NG7|4.0|This is a tiny bit dissapointing, but only because it came from the same band who brought us Angeldust (if you read my review on that album, mentally change that 4 to a 5 by the way). Although we still manage to get a little bit of r and b, trip hop, and Mr. Bungle style circus-metal, the genre hopping has been nipped in the bud, which may be a positive thing for you if you prefer their more commercial material, but for me it was just a bit of a letdown. Nonetheless, on the whole this is still a pretty solid set of slightly progressive alt-metal (the &quot;funk&quot; aspect of the band having been gradually toned down over the years), and while Mike Patton doesn't really get a chance to show his full vocal range here, he does very well, and the keyboards that were mostly missing on the previous album King For A Day... make a welcome return. Key tracks include the singles &quot;Last Cup Of Sorrow&quot; and &quot;Ashes To Ashes&quot;, the almost trip-hop &quot;Stripsearch&quot;, and the oddly beautiful &quot;Helpless&quot;. I would definitely get either The Real Thing or Angeldust first, but this isn't a bad purchase at all.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I was crazy not to watch The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in the theaters because if that film looked THAT amaZinG on my own big screen tv at home (which it did) then Oh MY...i could only imagine how spectacular, how intensifying it would look on the giant silver screen.  <br />This sequel engaged me from beginning to end.  I learned to love several characters while hating others.  Never has the battle of good versus evil looked so awing.  You know how after you keep seeing the good guys win again and again in so many films that you kinda get sick of it and wish the bad guys would conquer for once?? well...I can almost guarantee you will be rootin' on tHeSe good men til the very end.  I mean, their sheer passion to protect what is good, upright and noble is so compelling that you can almost taste the blood spilt on their behalf.  You are so much drawn into every scene that you almost forget your own surroundings.  <br />Unlike the first movie The Fellowship of the Ring, this second film focuses more on each individual character for the nine original members of the fellowship have split up into three different subgroups (as you see at the end of the first movie).  This allows for a larger scope of action that will bind you to your seat.  And is it just me or do those Oks keep getting uglier and uglier?? *shudders* haha  Clearly, this film isn't big on romance, but if you're curious to see if it follows the blossoming love between Aragorn and Arwen the daughter of the master elf...they do have some brief but substantial scenes together.<br />I have several favorite scenes in this film--all of which are parts in the battle of Helen's Keep.  I won't say exactly what they are so as not to spoil it for those of you who have not yet seen Two Towers.  It is all very exciting tho and sincerely impressive I must say.  This has to be my favorite movie of the year and that says alot because I usually favor romantic comedies.  Two Towers is filled with  action, adventure, lust, and emotion.  They call the great battle: the War of the Ring.  I call it the war of good vs. evil.  They did an awesome job of creating the special effects...and the animated characters possess so much realism that you may think they are people dressed in costume and an extreme amount of makeup.<br />I must add, if you are a huge fan of the handsome Legolas (Orlando Bloom)--like I am (of course ;) hehe)--you will be happy to find that he has more parts in this one than first.  And he shows off his fighting skills in addition to his expert archery talent.  Hmmm...and I have to say...i love it when he speaks Elf...it's smooth...rich and sexy! haha<br />Basically, if you loved the first one, you will be enchanted by its sequel (Two Towers) and I am more than anxious to see the final addition to the trilogy (The Return of the King) for I'm sure it will not dissapoint. =)  As long as they keep making 'em, I'm gonna keep seeing 'em. ;)
B00008PX8P|5.0|Led Zeppelin, the group that combined folk music, electric blues and jet-powered heavy metal and rode a wave of staggering success in the late '60s and '70s, has always been notoriously stingy with its music and strangely under-represented on film. The band's one concert movie, &quot;The Song Remains the Same,&quot; is a fine but limited portrait of the group that's hobbled by excess and the really lame short movies that are inserted in between the songs.<br />But no more.<br />&quot;Led Zeppelin,&quot; the new DVD collection of live performances, promos, interviews and videos, is - to put it mildly - an overflowing cornucopia of things that just flat-out rock.<br />Though casual Zeppelin fans will enjoy the double-disk set, hardcore acolytes will be blown away by the range of material: the group's Royal Albert Hall concert from 1970 (featuring the crunchy rarity, &quot;We're Gonna Groove&quot;); the Sydney Showground in Australia, 1972; Madison Square Garden, from 1973; Earls Court, 1975; and Knebworth, 1979. The set also includes footage of several of the band's 1969 appearances on European television, a handful of press conferences and interviews and the videos for &quot;Over the Hills And Far Away&quot; and (yes!) &quot;Traveling Riverside Blues.&quot;<br />It's more than five hours of stuff, and it takes viewers from the Zep'searly days (when guitarist Jimmy Page was still wearing a sweater-vest and cuff links onstage) to the eve of their demise - though their late '70s Knebworth concert is surprisingly energized.<br />Skipping through the various menus of the two disks, I eventually became a little overwhelmed by all the stuff that could be looked at and listened to. There's quite a bit of stuff here. But that's not a complaint, because when it comes to Zeppelin, it's infinitely better to have too much than not enough.
0440237688|5.0|I was unprepared for the depth of emotion that this lovely little book showed me.  This book is not as famous in Australia and I bought it on the strength of the reviews here on Amazon, but I must say that whereas the reviews do it justice in terms of how strong it is and well written it is, I was not prepared for the tears I cried at the end, and how much the story has effected me.  I find myself thinking of the central characters days after I have finished reading it.<br />I need not relate the plot, that has been done very well here, but it is all too easy to think of the things that we so willingly give up for an easy life.  Is this a prophetic book?  This is certainly an interesting point of discussion. My copy has a commentary by Ms Lowry at the back, and I noted with interest (through my tears) that the book is well read in Germany, where students read it in conjunction with stories of their own modern history, and I thought that this was a really telling observation.<br />I bought this book for my 12 year old daughter, but as she was half way through Harry Potter's fifth adventure, I thought I would read it first, and I'm pleased I did, as \\"The Giver\\" is a book that needs to be discussed and the reader almost de-briefed - it is such a powerful book.  So a message to all you parents out there - if your children have read or are going to read this book, you need to read it too, and give them the opportunity to discuss the themes and issues raised within.  This is not to suggest in any way that the book should be withheld from young readers - just that there will be value in your family to be able to discuss the characters and the future world in which they live.<br />It is a wonderful book - witty at times, and as I said, I cried at the end.  It is a truly powerful book that can make you laugh or cry, and this does both.  But anyone who dismisses this as a simple \\"young adult\\" novel is sadly mistaken.

B00009XITP|4.0|My friends saw the coming attractions for this movie a number of months ago.  When they saw that it starred Colin Firth, they all shouted at the screen, &quot;What Peggy Wants.&quot;  I'm a confirmed firth-a-holic.  But, I thought this movie might be another &quot;Thousand Acres&quot; and so waited til it came out on DVD to see it.<br />This is not great art or even great cinema.  But, hell, it's a lot of fun!  And many times that's what I crave from a movie.<br />The true acting comes from Mr. Firth who is perfectly cast as the English gentleman who would be PM -- and looks a bit like Tony Blair to boot.<br />His wild past with an American rock singer comes to an end that is full of deception.  And 17 years later his daughter from that past comes to find her dad.<br />Amanda Bynes is cute.  She doesn't really need to act.  Still, the on screen chemistry between she and Firth brings out some potentially amazing talent in this adorable young lady.<br />There's a lot of good humor and the music ain't bad either.<br />The scene where Firth dons leather pants and dances in front of the mirror is imspired.<br />For trivia buffs -- Anna Chancelor plays Mr. Firth's fiancee who is in it for the political prestige.  Some may recognize her as the unmarried Miss Bingley from the A&amp;E/BBC Pride and Prejudice.  She's a great character actress.  She doesn't get him in this story, either.<br />And -- was it my imagination that her stuck up daughter (Clarissa) bears such a striking resemblance to Reese Witherspoon?  Reese played Firth's ward in The Importance of Being Earnest.<br />Ok.  Final thoughts.  It's a fun movie.  As with Bridget Jones's Diary -- it's also a feel good movie -- and those are the ones I tend to watch again and again.  Granted:  Bridget Jones is an example of great film as well as a fun movie. Still, with Colin Firth in What a Girl Wants -- so much the better.
B00008977N|5.0|I've been waiting for this concert to come out on DVD for several years, now, and now that it has arrived, I am certainly not disappointed.  The joy, feeling, and power are evident in all of Gabriel's performances on the disc.  Truly amazing disc for the Gabriel, Genesis, or general music fan.
B0000AXM3Q|5.0|If you love Iron Maiden, you will love this album. In few words this album stands between &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;. To funs it will say a lot. You can hear the mix of those 3 in one!<BR>Good, realy good album!!!
0804106304|5.0|Though I got a little confused about who was who, this was one of the best books I have read.  I was about 14 (which could explain why I got confussed) and it put everything in perspective for me.  I was exposed to people who had very disfucntional relationships and I think that was what kinda broke me out of my shell.  It was an amazing story that I definitely recommend.
B000002H2H|5.0|Metallica emerged in 1983 with &quot;Kill Em All,&quot; a raw album with lots of aggression and riffs to please any headbanger.  While I did enjoy it, you could still tell they were getting the hang of things (especially with James Hetfeld's untrained voice).  Their true sound came to play in 1984 with one of my personal favorite metal albums, &quot;Ride the Lightning.&quot;  All true metal fans adore this album and for good reason.  If you're not a metal fan and you don't like this album, THERE HAS to be something wrong with you.<br />Bit O' Trivia:<br />As any headbanger knows, Dave Mustaine was the original guitarist for Metallica, but he had a bitter fall-out with Lars and James, causing him to leave and be replaced by Kirk Hammett.  Dave went on to form Megadeth, respectively.  You'll find many songs on here co-written by Dave Mustaine (he never performed on any Metallica album).<br />Fight Fire With Fire - An intense opening track, partially fooling you with a classical guitar intro.  The vocals are somewhat odd, but it's still a great song (although it seems like it should've been placed at the end... oh well, no complaints).  At the end, it fades into...<br />Ride the Lightning - The excellent title track from the album, you can definitely tell a major improvement for the band.  Kirk's exuberant solos and James's angst-filled vocals really make this a classic.  Gotta love the chorus.<br />For Whom the Bell Tolls - This song first got me into Metallica.  A great song with a crunchy guitar riff that I adore, although it annoys me that whenever this album is mentioned, this and the next song are usually the only ones mentioned.<br />Fade to Black - The &quot;gloom and doom&quot; ballad of the bunch.  You'll find many fans mixed on this one, but I personally enjoyed it despite the overplay on the radio and the fact that many claim it's the best song on the album.  The best has yet to come...<br />Trapped Under Ice - EXTREMELY underrated!  This rocker packs a wallop.  This song explores death by drowning and it has an undeniable hook to it that makes it stick in your head for hours.  This would be my personal favorite from the album, but as I said before the best has yet to come...<br />Escape - I would most likely label this the weakest of the tracklist.  While far from terrible, it doesn't have any quality that'll make it memorable.  The most memorable aspect of this song is Kirk's trademark solos.<br />....Are you ready for this one?<br />Creeping Death - My personal favorite Metallica song, EVER!  This song deals with the death angel in the Bible when Pharoah refuses to let Moses's people go.  A big departure in terms of songwriting (you would swear that Iron Maiden would've written this type of song before Metallica), but this has to be their best song ever.  It's awesome guitar riffs, solos, and vocals match perfectly to bring a fine metal song.<br />The Call of Ktulu - An impressive 8-minute instrumental piece that closes off the album.  I find it extremely pleasurable to listen to, if not on a regular basis.  I don't know why, but I think of DOOM, that awesome FPS game, whenever I listen to it.<br />Overall, this is a FINE piece of 80s metal.  This stands the test of time and proved that Metallica at one point were among the finest thrash metal bands in the business.  Too bad they sold out, though... With this, Metallica forged with &quot;Master of Puppets,&quot; their finest hour and their last with bass prodigy Cliff Burton.p.

B000002KKC|5.0|I've listened to this album for years.  I never owned it.  I used to borrow it from my cousin when I got the chance, or I would take it out of the library.  The album never ceased to amaze me.<br />I just love the flow from one song to another.  <br />Only downside is the remastering of the CD version of Tusk, as well as the remixing of &quot;I Know I'm Not Wrong&quot;, and the edited &quot;Sara&quot;.  The edited &quot;Sara&quot; is what bothers me the most.  How can you edit a classic?  They had enough room on the CD to make it fit!!<br />Oh Well.  That aside, I'm rating it based on the music.  Very creative, somewhat rougher production/style, but very FM.<br />The booklet of the CD is very depressing as well.  No extra pictures (except for a black and white photo of the band, as well as a small picture of them inside).  I seem to recall there was extensive photos and nice packaging to their original Tusk LP album (murals, photo(s) of tusks, the band, lyrics, etc).  Needs work Warner Brothers.<br />Bottom line: Great album, but a remastering and repackaging/take away remixes/editing and it would be much better.  Maybe Rhino can re-release it to a etter treatment for it's 25th anniversary.  Rhino I think has a re-release program with Warner Brothers Records/Asylum/Electra.<br />Enjoy!
B0000630BT|5.0|After the exhausting trial (two kids attempted suicide, one of them successful) and two often-underrated albums (&quot;Turbo,&quot; &quot;Ram It Down&quot;), drummer Dave Holland departed from the band feeling exhausted and tired of the band.  In his place comes in Scott Travis of Racer X, and he is one of the best drummers ever in the history of metal (IMHO).  With a slightly changed lineup, the Priest went into the studio with producer Chris Tsangarides (who helped engineer their second album &quot;Sad Wings of Destiny&quot; way back in the early 70s), who replaced longtime producer Tom Allom.<br />All things considered, this is a GREAT album.  Priest decided to abandon the pop/rock elements from the last two and took on a thrashier tone akin to Metallica and Slayer.  You have to wonder if other metal bands took this for inspiration; it wasn't a major hit at all, but a lot of other bands seem to have taken their style from this particular album.  Interesting.  Anywho, onto the tracks:<br />Painkiller - The monstrous title track and one of Priest's finest!  The vocals are very odd, but somehow they work; Rob really knew how to belt them out.  Watch out for Glen's side-splitting solos!<br />Hell Patrol - A cheesy but enjoyable track, some of Glen and K.K.'s best interplays are here.<br />All Guns Blazing - Another cheesy but enjoyable track, although this is one of my personal favorites.  It's actually very good and I'm not sure why some of the reviewers here did not like it.<br />Leather Rebel - A fan favorite (obviously), this sounds like a heavier Hell Bent For Leather.  Excellently performed, with the guitars and vocals in fine form and some of Scott's frenziest drumming.<br />Metal Meltdown - Arguably Scott Travis's angriest drumming on the album.  Awesome, intense track that should be a template for many metal bands.<br />Nightcrawler - My second favorite on the album.  What hooks me about this song is Rob's vocals... they are downright FREAKY, especially the midsection where he darkly whispers about the nightcrawler glaring at scared people.  This also bears a striking resemblance to the &quot;Defenders...&quot; track The Sentinel, which is my personal favorite Priest song of all time.<br />Between the Hammer and the Anvil - Awesome track with some of their darkest lyrics ever and one of the most recognizable Priest riffs of all time.<br />Touch of Evil - Interesting track with several keyboard sounds to create a creepy mood that Nightcrawler possessed.  You can kind of tell where Iced Earth got their influences from, even if Maiden was their main influence.<br />Battle Hymn - A short instrumental track that leads into...<br />....Are you ready?<br />One Shot At Glory - Rob's last song with the band (at least for now, he recently rejoined) and what a way to go!  This is sort of the epic of the album, and Rob's vocals have never been better!  Oh man, I love this song.<br />~Bonus Tracks~<br />Living Bad Dreams - This is a &quot;gloom and doom&quot; ballad the band did that was eventually cut out.  I personally enjoyed it, but I can see why it was cut... with a thrashy album that this became, this song might've offset it a little bit.  Still, at least we got it in one way or another.<br />Leather Rebel (LIVE) - Usually on remasters they tack on a live version and in the case of the Priest remasters, the live tracks were usually very good.  However, I have to switch gears for this one... the guitars and drums sound good, but Rob's voice isn't as good as on the studio recording.  I think you can tell he was ready to quit the band at this time.<br />Overall, I HIGHLY SUGGEST THIS TO ANY METAL FAN OF ANY TYPE.  This is Priest's last hoorah of the 90s before the sucktacular albums &quot;Jugulator&quot; and &quot;Demolition&quot; (although it WASN'T Ripper's fault!).  In any case, Priest has a new album due out in 2004, so let's hope they make a Painkiller Part 2.  I'm all for it.midsection where he darkly whispers about the nightcrawler glaring at scared people.

B000002LQR|5.0|length - 73:49<BR>Like the other guy said, this is easily one of the best albums of the 90s. I've always had a special place in my heart for The Red Hot Chili Peppers, especially for this album. I don't mean to just say I like this because it's regarded as such an important album either. I sincerely think it is a fantastic record. In addition to the epic and highly acclaimed Under the Bridge, such tracks as Breaking the Girl, Funky Monks, The Righteous and the Wicked and Apache Rose Peacock abound in captivating grandeur that is truely breathtaking. This is just such a great album, I'm getting excited as I'm listening to it while writing this review. Definitely go out and get this one, I recommend it to all.
B0000025VU|4.0|The word Israel isn't spoken or written anywhere on this recording. But Israel takes center stage for a couple tracks on Infidels. There's a photo of Bob on the inside sleeve with Jerusalem in the background. The title of the album is a little suspicious as well.<br />Infidels has a bluesy/country feel to it. Bob Dylan's raspy and flat vocals have a lot of heart and proves that a musician can be effective without having a great singing voice. The lyrics are thought-provoking, sarcastic and sometimes indecipherable.<br />On the fast, country tinged Union Sundown, Dylan talks about the clothes he wears, none of which have been made in America. I am I and Don't Fall Apart on Me Tonight are mellow and sound similar to his previous Just Like a Woman. Many songs featured harmonicas and slide guitars and are structured like blues songs as opposed to sing-along ballads.<br />Man of Peace reminds one of leaders like Yassir Arafat, with its refrain of \\"sometimes even Satan comes as a man of Peace.\\" Lyrics of shaking hands and good intentions gone bad could be about the Camp David accords of today if they weren't written during the Camp David Accords of 1983. Wasn't it Bob Dylan that also sang \\"where have all the flowers gone/when will they ever learn?\\" But the listener is apparently left to make that judgement independently.<br />In terms of the Israel connection, Neighborhood Bully is a real standout. It isn't musically superior, but the lyrics hit hard. Menachem Begin, American foreign aide and Iraq's Osirak nuclear reactor are all invoked without mentioning any of them by name.
B000002MTR|4.0|For the most part, this is a really fun album. Aeroplane, Walkabout, Tearjerker, these are all great tracks. My only complaint is that some of the tracks get a little too hazy and experimental. These are the moments when the Chili Peppers loose their hold of me. Warped is a pretty bad opener in my opinion. It's basically just a dark droning voice followed by a repetitive riff for 5 minutes. Aeroplane though, track number 2, is something entirely different. Very light-hearted and funky, it's a whimsical track affirming the Pepper's love of music, their aeroplane (There is a childrens chorus and a sweet guitar break that add to the fun feel to the song as well.) Deep kick regresses back to experimentation, but gets good at the end. The song is 6 and a half minutes long, with some bizarre poetry followed by an aggressive foray of instruments, and finally, a straightforward rocking finish that is, in the end, rewarding. My Friends is the hit from the album. And it probably is the best song on here. It's just really really good. It's a little sad, but strangely enough, you feel a lot better about everything by the end of the track. That's how I feel anyway. Coffee Shop is pretty dark and scary, a song for fans of the more hard-edged Chili Pepper stuff. Not really my bag. Pea is a really cool song. As you might have guessed, it's just Pea and his bass lamenting. Very cool. One Big Mob has a sort of romping, tribal feel to it. It rocks pretty hard, but it's another one of the tracks that I could take or leave. Walkabout is a great track. It's probably the funkiest track on the album, and the bizarre lyrics are a perfect offset to such a groovy beat. Tearjerker is another great song. The lyrics seem odd and maybe even facetious, but the music itself can definetly make you cry. It's very nice. One Hot Minute is another track that could be about 3 minutes shorter. There's a lot of dissonant nonsense in the beginning, but just like Deep Kick, it gets good at the end. Falling Into Grace is another funky number, followed by Shallow Be Thy Game, another twisted, funked up chili dance. Transcending is a decent closer. I'm not sure if it lives up to it's name, but it's pretty good. For me, the Chili Peppers' eccentricities can be a little hard to swallow at times, but inside the hard edges of this album are many rewarding gems, and I think this would be a good buy for any fan of hard rock or funk rock.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Being a long time Maiden fan and embracing their return to form with 2000's Brave New World, I was unsure whether they could repeat the strength and power with thier latest offering &quot;Dance of Death.&quot; Well, they have done it, and then some! With a mix of classic heavy metal crunch and the progressive rock influences of Yes and Jethro Tull, Maiden have come full circle since the debut studio album Iron Maiden in 1980, followed by a string of strong records in Killers (1981), Number of the Beast (1982), Peace of Mind (1983), Powerslave (1984), Somewhere In Time (1986), Seventh Son (1988). Axe slinger Adrian Smith departed just before the No Prayer For The Dying sessions in 1990. A few years later, Smith was followed by lead singer Bruce Dickinson shortly after the album Fear of the Dark (1992). Maiden continued on, tapping Wolvesbane front man Blaze Bailey and released The X-Factor (1996) and Virtual XI (1998). These albums had thier moments, but could not sustain the magic of the 80's. After a reunion tour in 1999, and the triumphant return of both Smith and Dickinson, Maiden were now a group of six, with a three guitar attack of Murray, Smith, and Gers. Brave New World was a return to greatness for Maiden and included an album of musical epics and crushing guitar riffs. With Dance of Death, they have picked up where BNW left off. Soaring harmonies, atmospheric orchestration, solid riffs, and tenacious vocals by Dickinson make this a heavy metal resurrection of sorts! Without boring you with a song by song review, DOD simply delivers! Pick it up today and you will not put it down! <br />Brian Shepherd
B00009V8Z9|3.0|Am I the only one who thinks Gavin DeGraw sounds like Justin Timberlake? It gets distracting for me at times, hearing his voice and getting songs like God Must Have Spent A Little More Time On You or Tearin Up My Heart stuck in my head...but there are a number of really good songs on here. Chariot and Chemical Party are my two favorites. The former is a rocking ballad, the latter an upbeat party song. The overall sound of this disc focuses on Gavon's singing, with mostly piano and guitars as the instrumental centerpiece. Some songs sound more or less similar to eachother, lacking strong varieties that would make a great record. I think the excessive similarities disallow multiple songs to stick in your head. As a debut cd though, I'd say this is pretty promising. Fans of John Mayer, Jason Mraz or Dave (a bit of a stretch I guess) should probably check this guy out. Oh and NSYNC fans too, for Gavin's Timberlakesque crooning, may want to hear Gavin as well.
B00005A0N5|5.0|While power metal is, let's all admit it, corny by nature, there are some special bands that can make an overall laughable genre of music into something beautiful.  No band can claim this ability more than Nightwish.  Even when you put aside the glorious vocals of Tarja, you get something instrumentally spectacular.  Tuomas knows how to execute keyboards properly, without overdoing the synthesizer or drowning out the guitars & drums.  The orchestration demonstrates musical precision found in very few bands.  More so than any other Nightwish until Century Child, Oceanborn fully exploits the true potential of these crazy Finns to a level that will blow away even the person most adamantly opposed to power metal.<br />Basically, it's not pure power metal, but it's obvious that the subgenre has had an enormous influence on the band.  If you could imagine Stratovarius mixed with Dream Theater and an operatic female voice, you'd get a slight idea of what to expect.  Actually, that was a pretty bad analogy, because Nightwish is really in a class of their own.  You have to hear them for yourself.  Most will argue that it's Tarja's vocals that make the album what it is.  I'm one to disagree.  While she has a lovely voice, it doesn't always work with the music.  There are times when Tarja goes one way and Tuomas & the band go the exact opposite, particularly in the ballads.  She should consider lowering the pitch an octave for some of the tunes (and I think she realized that when they made Century Child).  But when she manages to interwtine her vocals with the music, such as on the brilliant and powerful track \\"Gethsemane\\", the result is beyond words.  I'm a sucker for good drumming as well, and Jukka does not disappoint.  In a vein similar to Lacuna Coil, Nightwish utilizes percussion to add character and complexity to their music, and not just to back up the guitars or, like many mainstream American bands (hint hint: Evanescence), just to say they have a drummer.  <br />Standout tracks include the aforementioned \\"Gethsemane\\", the synth-loaded (but not overdone) \\"Sacrament of Wilderness\\", the bonus track ballad \\"Sleeping Sun\\" (not listed on the back of the jewel case), and, once you get into it and if you can drown out the pitiful male vocals, \\"Devil & The Deep Dark Ocean.\\"  Those seeking brilliant guitar work may be a tad let down, but Emppu can deliver a satisfactory performance for those who aren't anal about precision riffs.  He's not a bad guitarist by any means, it's just that he's no Peter Lindgren or Kirk Hammett.  This was Nightwish's first album with a bassist, so that makes it sound a lot better than their debut Angels Fall First, which was good but lacking in production and sound quality.  Finally, on a side note, Tarja was quite a good-looking girl in her younger days, although it seems as if she's put on some weight (I shouldn't talk...) and doesn't look so good in the Century Child pics... sorry if I sound shallow.  Anyway, get this album, because if you're disappointed with it, then I think there might be something wrong with your taste in music.  I mean, you'd have to be one of those morons that thinks Eminem has talent to say this is a bad album!
B00000J7JO|5.0|With Californication, the cavorting funk/rock gods seem to have their antics all bottled up into a spectacular, raging album of shattered harmony and bleak beauty. What makes this album so awesome is its diversity. There are all sorts of different songs on here, and just about all of them are good. The record as a whole has a sort of longing, melancholy vibe to it, limning such dreary yet beautiful songs as Scar Tissue (Scar tissue that I wish you saw, Sarcastic mister know it all. Close your eyes and I'll kiss you cause, With the birds I'll share this lonely view), and Otherside (I heard your voice through a photograph. I thought it up it brought up the past. Once you know you can never go back, I've got to take it on the otherside). Other highlights include Easily, a real rocker, Porcelain, a soft ballad, Saviour, a great rocknroll song that reminds me of some of Neil Young's stuff, and Roap Trippin', a song about chilling out while on tour- done up with some fantastic guitar work. After this awesome record, I have to admit that the Chili Peppers have uncanny staying power, and they really are legends of my generation. I think this cd is as good as any of their others. Recommended.
B000002HMH|4.0|Load is a step backwards after the Black Album and earlier works such as Master of Puppets and Ride The Lightning, but the band was &quot;changing with the times&quot; so to say, basically selling out.  But Metallica has (or should I say, had) the ability to &quot;sell out with style,&quot; as Load is still a very enjoyable album.  Highlight tracks are: &quot;Ain't My B!tch,&quot; &quot;The House Jack Built,&quot; &quot;Until It Sleeps,&quot; &quot;King Nothing,&quot; and &quot;Bleeding Me.&quot;  Otherwise, it's all decent material, but nothing for the band to brag about.  I don't really have much to say about it, except that if you're open-minded, you're going to find at least something you like about Load.
B00004ZAV3|5.0|I was listening to One the other day and thinking how I'd rather just listen to the White Album or Revolver. Then I turned on the popular radio station and had an epiphany. ALL of the Beatles music is hundreds of times better than todays popular music. If I were to pretend for a minute that I wasn't a snobby music kid who grew up listening to all of the great Beatles albums, I would probably think this is the absolute best record in the world. And in modern terms, it is a great disc. <br />I'm writing this review based solely on my perspective of these 27 number 1 hits. They're all good, some better than others. But if I was someone who grew up with the Beatles, I'm sure I'd have a different appreciation for this disc. I'm sure there would be so many great memories that are waiting to be revisited when a 60s child throws this in the player. I grew up (I'm still growing up I guess) in the 90s, and The Beatles and fond memories go hand in hand for me, so I'm sure those pleasant thoughts would be augmented greatly for someone who really lived when the Beatles were playing their extraordinary music. (And for anyone else not to familiar with the Beatles, great moments are soon to be had!) <br />What really makes this a 5 star collection is the memories. It may sound a bit mawkish or hackneyed, but everyone has done or felt or saw something marvelous while listening to the Beatles. Those special feelings can be manifested most easily by this seminal collection. This could really be the soundtrack to so many people's lives. I have to recommend this collection to everyone, because I'd be very sad to learn of anybody missing out on the joyous experience of the Beatles. They will always be the best band. These are all just my humble opinions, but I feel passionately about this music. I honestly think everyone should understand these legendary men and what they did for music. This album is the perfect place to start.
B00002Z88D|2.0|See, if the title had anything to do with S&amp;M and the songs related thereto, it would be cool!  But instead, it just means San Francisco Orchestra + Metallica...<br />Metallica, please stay away from neoclassical metal.  You're only trying to overdo yourselves more than you need to.  Lately, Metallica has been releasing a sledge of junk:  First there was ReLoad, which aside from the first four songs is boring in my opinion and for the most part can hardly be heralded as metal; this I will go into in due course; Garage, Inc. showcased the band's mediocre ability to do covers, which to me suffered because a) I'm typically not crazy about covers, and b) all but two of them were mediocre to horrible; and St. Anger sounds like a failed attempt to introduce Meshuggah's sound to the American mainstream under the cover of Metallica trying to &quot;return to their roots.&quot;  Well, I will say that, as great of musicians as they are, Metallica never did have much character, but lately, they've been using the talent that they definitely have in all the wrong ways.  A live album, trying to enter the realm of a subgenre of metal that Metallica, sadly, knows nothing about, was really a bad idea.<br />Let's start with vocals.  There are two types of metal fans in general: those who couldn't care less about vocals (and there's nothing wrong with that point of view; heck, with that type of outlook, you might just enjoy this album!), and those who feel that vocal skill is just as important as instrumental talent.  Without the production and sound doctoring, Hetfield sounds bad, almost as bad as he did later on St. Anger.  Okay, so you don't care about vocals.  The basic fact of the matter is that Metallica is not a neoclassical band, and a symphony orchestra does not work well with their music as it would with, say, Symphony X or Blind Guardian.  You really can't blame them for experimentation, but could it just be that Metallica thinks they can get away with anything they want?  Apparently, according to sales figures, they can, but I think they're doing longtime fans a big disservice by changing their style so frequently.  Now, since this was a live album and a one-time thing, it's easier to excuse than the foray into country/California rock on ReLoad or the sloppiness of St. Anger, but the overall whine of myself and many others is that Metallica is losing their identity and selling out.  But make of it what you will; see for yourself.
B00001U03Q|3.0|For starters, this cd doesn't contain the stuff that made Eric Clapton a legend. He is one of the greatest guitarists to ever live, but in my opinion, he was made to rock, not roll. Some of the songs on here are very good, namely Change The World, Running On Faith and Tears in Heaven, but the rest seem unctuous and forced. I'm just a kid and I have absolutely no real grounds to call this music banal, but I think my preferences may be similar to kids like me who would rather a collection made by a rocking legend, not a lachrymose geriatric. So for anyone expecting Mr. Clapton's classics fresh out of the oven, beware. These songs are frozen, not baked.
B000005DSN|4.0|Let me begin by saying that I despise Stratovarius, everything they believe in and their entire musical theory.  But being an open-minded listener, I heard &quot;Black Diamond&quot; (their most popular song, and indeed, by far their best) and was shocked by it.  This prompted me to open up a little to these Finns, so I bought Visions, Destiny, and Elements 1.  Destiny was a waste, and Elements 1 was mediocre, but something about Visions just stood out like a shining light in a dark hall... or like a beautiful blood-covered girl in bondage in a dark room (sorry, sadist fetishes popping into mind).  This one seems to have a lot more character to it.  The vocals aren't nearly as annoying, and they don't push the atheist stuff like they do in Elements 1.  Of course, I still don't consider it a high-value item in my music collection, and I don't have anything against those who like it, because different tastes in music is what makes artists great.  The band has talent, but I've said it before and I'll say it again, they get a lot more credit than other bands who deserve it just as much, if not more.  So check out the cdnow.com samples, see if you like it, then tell me if my slightly-biased but honest review helped out.  Okay, you don't really have to tell me.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|After listening to this album a few times today, I can defenitely say that Maiden have captured their true sound once again. The album is even more true than their last(Brave New World). The have continued where they left off in their hayday. It has all the classic elements plus some updated ones that blend together perfectly. Bruce's voice is still top notch and the rest of the band follow right along. One listen and you will defenitely know its Maiden but at the same time it is 2003 Maiden and they do not let you down, from the opening track of Wildest dreams(shades of the Number of the Beast sound) to the greatly done epic Paschendale, the album truly shines.<br />Pick up the album, a true fan and the new ones will truly enjoy it... Up The Irons...
B0000584V3|4.0|I love Opeth.  I love what they've done with metal, particularly the bland subgenre known as \\"death\\" metal, turning it into a listening experience beyond the casual listener's comprehension.  But for some reason, as hard as I try, I can't get into Blackwater Park like I can their other albums.  Still Life caught me off guard immediately, and I can play Morningrise over and over, but Blackwater Park seems to have something missing.  Maybe it's because it doesn't appear (to me) to be as melodic, and is a little more primitive in sound.  It's raspier, the guitars are a little crunchier (?), and so on.  But I still enjoy it more than a lot of other \\"death\\" and \\"black\\" metal.  Anything by Opeth is surreal and hauntingly beautiful.  This is not a bad album by any means; I don't believe that Opeth is capable of making a bad album.  For the fans who say their acoustic passages are too \\"soft\\", I'd say you are just a reject trying to act big and bad and you wouldn't know music if it were shoved down your throat with a sledge hammer.  While it takes a little more getting into than other Opeth albums, Blackwater Park is still highly recommended by yours truly.  There's enough heaviness to make TRUE metal fans (not punk-ass posers) happy, but also enough of that folk-influenced acoustic work that makes Opeth a truly unique and masterful band.  Go get it today.
B00006L83N|5.0|This is the first Symphony X album i have bought and the musicianship and sheer amount of twists and turns running through the album absolutely blew me away !!<BR>Guitarist Michael Romeo is a massive talent but all the band are sooo talented, tight and focused, with brilliant songs and a profound knowledge of classical structures and renaissance melodies. <BR>  Listening to songs like King of Terrors and the awesome title track, i thought they were good, but the more I listen, the better they get !! If you like Steve Vai, Malmsteen or any of the top guitar players, you will get so much from this album. If you like incredible, dense, epic songs you'll love it !<BR>  Probably the best album of its genre I have ever heard.
B00007LL7O|3.0|Stratovarius gets what I feel to be a lot of undue credit.  They are a cheesy power metal band with nothing to offer over and above what other bands of the subgenre have.  Their lyrics are nothing spectacular; half of the songs are the same stupid and cliche shouting of \\"I hate God/there is no God.\\"  Well, something in the vicinity of 60% of the world's population is Christian, and another large chunk is Islamic, both of whom embrace a divinity, so it seems really dumb to me that a band (particularly one as corny as Stratovarius) would go out of their way to offend members of those faiths.  Now, I'm solid in my religion so nothing any band could say could change mine, so I really couldn't care less what they say, but it really gets annoying when they push the same atheist views in almost every song on the album.  Lyrics should be used to make the music more effective, not to present subliminal ques to weak metal fans who are easily coopted to believe whatever their favorite band tells them to believe in.  But anyway, this is relatively a minor issue in the grand scheme of things, so let's talk about the talent and creativity of the band.<br />Is Strato a talented band?  Without a doubt.  I will justly give credit where credit is due.  But are they better than bands like Blind Guardian, Symphony X, Edguy, Iced Earth, etc. who are often overlooked by Strato fans?  No way in hell.  Honestly, Strato is the least creative of all of the aforementioned bands, as Strato does not incorporate any progressivism into their music.  Their musical scheme is somewhat repetitive, and while I'm not denying Timo Tolkki's guitar abilities, he does tend to play the same riffs over and over again, with marginal changes to keep his playing legitimate.  Kotipelto is a horrible vocalist; even Sonata Arctica's Tony Kakko, who is younger and has never had a voice lesson in his life (according to his bio on the SA website), is a far superior vocalist in my opinion.  Johansson's keyboards are good, but not a whole lot different than what you'd hear from Symphony X or Dream Theater.  The percussion is practically nonexistent; it sounds like they used a drum machine in the background for the \\"power metal\\" speed-percussion effect and put a guy there to bang on a drumset just to say they had a drummer.<br />I don't want to spend my whole review bashing Stratovarius, because Elements 1 isn't all bad.  The ballad [is bad], but overall, the songs are much better than stuff on Destiny or any album other than Visions.  I don't own them all, but I've heard enough samples and I've been forced to endure them from others.  I bought Elements 1 because I heard a sample and liked it, and from my previous exposures to Stratovarius, I was actually surprised to find a decent and halfway enjoyable album.  The killer was the repetitiveness, the weak vocals and overdone lyrics, and the overall blandness of the product.  Maybe I'm a little biased because of all the (in my opinion, undeserved) credit the band gets.  But in all honesty, Elements Pt. 1 is a pretty good album that, if you ignore vocals and lyrics, you might find yourself liking.  Heck, even I find myself popping it into the CD player every once in a while!
0060977493|1.0|I nearly gave up at the first couple of chapters .... I just could not get into this book, which I had the misfortune to take along on vacation. What I understood throughout the first half is that Sophie Mol dies. Then we look forward to the climax of her death but alas it is lost among childish phrases repeated meaningless sentences &amp; you think to yourslef when you finish the book: Oh why did I even bother!<BR>The writing is extremely pretencous with no taste at all, the reader is completely ignored through refernces to things utterly indian &amp; are a mystery to most.

B00000FCBC|1.0|A double CD composed entirely of a collection of, for the most part, poorly done covers.  Is this what we expect from Metallica, a band that is supposed to have great songwriting ability of their own?  Not at all.  Two of the covers (&quot;Turn The Page&quot; and &quot;Loverman&quot;) are very good, but the others either just weren't meant for Metallica (such as the Skynyrd cover) or shouldn't have even been attempted.  Now, I personally don't like covers; I'd rather hear a band release only its own work, because originality is most of the reason to like a band.  I guess if you like covers, you'll like this one, but if you've been disappointed with the recent Metallica downfall (I'd say that it was after Load that they started going down, because I actually do have somewhat of a liking for Load), don't expect a relief from the plague in Garage, Inc.
B00005OAIE|4.0|No doubt the editor was in the middle of a bad day when he wrote this review. John Mayer is a very good artist, with a voice that speaks to the soul. And, one day, Eddie Vedder (Pearl Jam) said to a magazine: You dont have to be sad to write sad music!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|If you love Iron Maiden, you will love this album. In few words this album standes between &quot;Fear of the Dark&quot;, &quot;No Prayer for the Dying&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son Of A Seventh Son&quot;. To funs it will say a lot. You can hear the mix of those 3 in one!<BR>Good, realy good album!!!
B000059WH0|5.0|To me it is pretty obvious.<BR>All post Jeff Porcaro albums are just pretty bad. Simon is good in his own right. But the magic died with Jeff. Mindfield was just embarrassing.<BR>I saw Jeff play in clubs and as well with Toto many times. The air was just the most vibrant and Jeff IS the gruuv. Not a technical player per se. It's all heart. And hey, I'm a guitar player. I'm just putting in my 2 cents.<br />This shows another side of Jeff's diverse musicmanship. Hard, Zeppelin style drumming. And House of the holy was one of his biggest inspiration.<BR>In comparison if you listen to Jake to the bone. You hear him playing straight eight notes on the hi-hat while the rest of the band kinda swing. I went to the Jeff tribute concert at Universal Amphitheather in L.A to see Simon in the hot seat. When the time came for Jake to the bone. He totally destroyed the groove by playing swing on the hi-hat. Totally ruin the whole thing. Is it just me being oversensitive or?<br />Ok. Enough about Jeff. This was their final album as I'm concerned. I just don't get Tambu, Mindfield and even worse. Through the looking glass. Great idea, but so poorly executed. They should have choosen more obscure stuff, more r&amp;b stuff that they can do so well. More loose and jammy. But tackle icons like While my guitar gently weeps, then it's just failure.<br />Again. Sorry to bash them, because I love them as musicians.<br />This is an awesome album. Buy, buy, buy. It's Jeff's swansong.
0151003084|5.0|Dark, morbid, violent and creatively brilliant. This book adds humor to gore and visually brightens your day, the artwork consists of very good black ink drawings,each page has some specific death for a child in alphabetical order, such as,(K is for Katie who was struck with an axe, or, X is for Xerxes devoured by mice).Noe the fact that all these nasty things happen to children should not dissuade you, its humor people, just don't buy the book for you kids.All of Edward Gorey's book should be collected because of the artwork and the fantastically morbid story's, I know I'll be buying more.
0060920084|4.0|I read this book several years ago...this was my first of many Bill Bryson books in fact.  I was on a flight from Ireland to the USA, sitting in the middle of the plane, next to a kindly American Catholic Priest from Rhode Island, and two middle-aged American women.  I giggled and laughed out loud so many times that they all kept asking me 'Why...What...'  I attempted to read to them from the book.  I'm not sure that they found the humour as funny as I did...and I kept giggling as I read.  I think this book is well worth a read.  I am an American living in Ireland for 10+ years...and it IS healthy to have a laugh about our great, quirky, interesting and mundane all at the same time, country!
B000092ZYX|3.0|I think I can probably safely say that Radiohead is one of my favorite bands. Since 'the Bends' I have been in complete awe of this band and Thom Yorke's voice. I thought their turn into electronic(ish) music was great and just showed how talented these guys actually are. But with them returning to a more rock oriented album, I was disappointed. I read that they even wrote songs differently on this album in a reaction to the way Thom Yorke wrote most of the songs on &quot;Kid A&quot; and &quot;Amnesiac.&quot; Well I wish they hadn't changed anything. There are some really great songs on this album but as a whole it doesn't hold up to their previous work. Everyone loved this album and I really wish I did too but I didn't. Some of the songs start out really beautiful and on par with classic Radiohead but then they turn into moments of craziness that I didn't enjoy. If you love Radiohead than you should without a doubt give this a listen. But if you are expecting anything like their last two records you might be unfufilled, like I was.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I haven't heard this album yet (as the people at Circuit City and Coconuts should all be fired out of a cannon) but I heard &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; when Iron Maiden DESTROYED Chicago last month and I've been a rabid fan since the age of 12 for a reason...because they are the BEST BAND TO EVER COME OUT OF BRITAIN...EVER. I am confident that I will be more than pleased once again.  (full review later)
B000089RVX|1.0|I understand it is aimed at little pop punk fans but this album  is just not rock/metal.I would be ashamed to call my self a devout lover of metal music if this came ionto the genre.<BR>I hate this album with a passion.I would strongly reccomend you buy albums from real bands such as (hed)pr, static X, coal chamber, bionic jive, blink 182, greenday, alkaline trio etc....
B00004TH6O|4.0|In between the very excellent self-titled indie release on Loosgroove and the outstanding &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot;, Queens debuted on a major label with Rated R. Loved by critics, it was likely much of the press' introduction to this one-of-a-kind desert rock monster. While I do like Rated R, it pales as more of an in-between album for Queens Of The Stone Age.<br />&quot;Feel Good Hit&quot; is a two-chord barnburner that is simplistic as hell and rocks like a speeding freight train and it folds over immediately into a much poppier number...still good, but not as rocking. The next couple of tracks are good but more akin to off-beat indie rock stuff a la Sonic Youth. &quot;Monsters In The Parasol&quot; is the best song on the album by far with a swell driving rhythm that sounds like one of those refurbished classic cars just speeding down the road with the loud muffler that somehow evens itself out and sounds almost pleasant. The back half of Rated R is also worthy of note but nothing stands out like the aforementioned.<br />If you're looking to complete your Queens collection, you'd be a damn fool to pass this CD up. It's not their strongest effort overall but it is a quality album with some really standout tracks. For the cream of their current catalog, &quot;Songs For The Deaf&quot; has something for everyone. When they're going for poppy, they are catchy as can be. When they are looking to rock, they put the masters to shame. When they are in the mood for heavy, they will crush the competition. For those seeking their most stoner-like works, their self-titled album is about picture perfect in that capacity.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Look Out! Be Afraid! Run For It! Its a movie that actually has a plot involving personal reflection. The entire point of this trilogy is to show the struggle between the choices we make every day of our lives and the consequences. Its not another mindless action flick with subpar acting and a plot so full of meaningless holes. The holes left within the Matrix \\"Reloaded\\" are called plotlines and red herrings. It is a movie designed for two things:<BR>1 - To awe you with its amazing special effects<BR>2 - To Make you think, make you question the motives of the movie and the motives of yourselves.<br />Its true that some scenes were done with the specific reference to kill time. But ask yourself...faced with the idea of 250,000 sentinels burrowing deep into the earths core to kill you...wouldnt you throw a party and try to celebrate your life on the perspective final night of your life??
0060934913|5.0|The only weakness in this book is that it's really more a series of essays than a book -- it doesn't hold together all that well cover-to-cover.  But you will have fun reading this book if you've ever worked in a restaurant, or even if you've ever just eaten in a restaurant (a decent one, that is -- not McDonlds or a chain place, but an actual decent restaurant), though it may disabuse you of any incipient wish you may have to become a chef.  This book is one of the few I've read that really lives up to its reputation - it and Bourdain are justly acclaimed. Almost in spite of himself, Bourdain's love of food and life comes through in every chapter.  This book is informative, funny, and honest -- what more could you possibly ask for in nonfiction?
B0000AXE8I|3.0|When I first saw Reloaded I was disappointed because of the sudden change in the roles of the characters. But after watching the movie the second time I saw more into the plot, the scene with the Oracle is the key. I agree with most that the plot was ambiguous with all the philosophical psychobabble but the arguments of deterministic nature and free will, will come full circle in Revolutions because they go hand in hand. But they did their job with the cliffhanger. Wether you like the movie or not you will watch Revolutions if you are a die hard Matrix fan.
B00005R0VH|5.0|This album is the classic of all classics.  There is not a song on it that I don't love!  A one-of-a-kind recording that can never be repeated.  It sure will bring you back to the good old days of your youth (If you're about 50 years old!).  Eric Clapton at his finest.  A must-have no matter what age you are.  Buy it now!!!  You cannot go wrong.
0312958455|5.0|I was really into this book because it gives the readers a chance to look into Harry Bosch's past a little further. With him investigating his mothers murder, I was cheering him along the whole way. And in classic Connelly style, there are many twists, turns and surprises.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The brand new album by Iron Maiden!<BR>As usual, Maiden put up together a brilliant piece of music combained into an album...<BR>The band is still the same as in the last studio album, &quot;Brave New World&quot;, which means that Nicko McBrain is on the drums, Steve Harris on Bass, Dave Murry, Adrian Smith &amp; Janick Gers on guitar &amp; the great vocals of Bruce Dickinson.<BR>Great songs on this album, like the first single, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, &amp; some other good tracks like &quot;Rainmaker&quot;.<BR>A great buy, VERY recommended!

B000002UJQ|5.0|You get yourself a copy of OK Computer, you lie down on the floor with a speaker on either side of your head, maybe a foot or two away.  Turn the volume up a bit and the lighting down a bit.  Get the remote into your paw, one finger on the &quot;repeat&quot; button so that you won't have to move much.  Get comfy.  Not too comfy; just comfy enough.  You close your eyes, and<br />Play track five.  All done?  Great.  Now, please play track five again.  When you have finished, I recommend that you play track five several times.  Repeat this process until you can feel something sinking down through your bones and into the floor underneath you.  Kind of like the floor collapsing.  Weightless.<br />THEN come back here and give this album one star.  <br />I dare you.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The Irons did a fine job, it's a superb album (unfortunately we cannot say the same about the cover)Below you'll find a list with my opinion of the songs.<br /><br />WILDEST DREAMS<br />Previewed on the recent 'Give Me Ed... Til I'm Dead' tour, this is a dynamic rocker which kicks off the album with a bang. Judging from the number of people in the European audiences who could sing the chorus after only one hearing, it's bound to become a live favourite.<br />RAINMAKER<br />Literally a 'storming' (!) song, 'Rainmaker is another racy rocker which keeps up the galloping opening pace. And again, after one airing, the chorus is instantly memorable.<br />NO MORE LIES<br />The first of the four 7+ minute epics on the album, this is an opus entirely self-penned by Steve Harris, with typically thoughtful lyrics. The low-key opening gives way to a punchy chorus, with Nicko's drums almost Bonhamesque in their intensity, and the '3 Amigos' also shine on the three-part solo.<br />MONTSEGUR<br />Inspired by an infamous episode in the history of the crusading Knights Templar and powered by thunderous riffs, 'Montsegur's high-flying arrangement mimics the horror and confusion of the historic massacre.<br />DANCE OF DEATH<br />The centrepiece of the album, 'Dance Of Death' is an eerie tale featuring powerful and graphic lyrics and a guitar-based 'devil's trill' that is taken up by the whole band as they whirl away in a demonic reel. Steve Harris' storytelling at its best and most vivid.<br />GATES OF TOMORROW<br />An urgent guitar clarion call builds into a relentlessly fast-paced song, featuring a hard-hitting chorus and enigmatic lyrics. And watch out for the sizzling guitar solo in the middle!<br />NEW FRONTIER<br />It's only taken him 20 years, but Nicko enjoys his first writing credit with this tale of the dangers of man trying to play God by subverting nature. That message aside, it's an exuberant uptempo number that kicks serious ass.<br />PASCHENDALE<br />The second song on the album inspired by a historic battle, this time one from the First World War, after a sorrowful opening featuring a needle sharp guitar figure, the band burst in with an instrumental arrangement that sounds like an artillery barrage. Another memorable epic.<br />FACE IN THE SAND<br />Another enigmatic, atmospheric song which piles on the drama as it builds in intensity, it features a big swinging melody which is echoed in the central guitar solo. A slow grower, you'll suddenly find yourself humming the chorus when you least expect it!<br />THE AGE OF INNOCENCE<br />After the deceptively mellow melodic opening, the mood turns from sorrowful to scathing, as Bruce spits out Steve's lyrics of disillusionment and injustice and similarly, the surprisingly smooth chorus contrasts with the piledriving riffs of the verse.<br />JOURNEYMAN<br />Although it features acoustic guitars and strings, there's nothing soft about this album closer, which showcases Bruce's vocals beautifully. Its truculent chorus with its refusal to compromise echoes the sentiments of 'Wildest Dreams' and rounds the album off beautifully.<br /><br />Up The Irons (cya at 5th of Nov. in Ahoy Rotterdam!!)album inspired by a historic battle, this time one from the First World War, after a sorrowful opening featuring a needle sharp guitar figure, the band burst in with an instrumental arrangement that sounds like an artillery barrage.

B000065V9N|4.0|This is a very good recording.  But it is not the best that PG  has in his catalog.  Depending on whether or not you are a lifetime follower of PG or just a bandwagon SO follower.  PG has some mezmerizing work, Security/PG3 and even UP are better than this.. but don't get me wrong, this is a great cd, and I am glad that PG made it, because US was not as commerical and UP is way out in space like his early work.<br />Merit, but not as great as his early stuff, or his new stuff.. and how many artist can you say that about?
B00006BTCA|3.0|I say this because I was expecting different. According to Amazon, this album is appreciated by people who like The Flaming Lips, Wilco, and the Shins. Beyond this, Amazon kept dropping it in my \\"Boy, you'll like this!\\" web page. <BR>So anyway, I'm thinking, \\"cool, some inspired, mellow tunes to add to my collection.\\" I'd downloaded \\"NYC\\" and really liked it. Everything looked good. After enough exposure, I finally caved in and bought it (...in a big end display at Best Buy, which should have been a sign).<BR>It look little time to appreciate that \\"NYC\\" is in no way representative of the tone of the album. It's much more like the White Stripes or The Strokes than the previously mentioned bands. It's a lot of high-energy guitar and fuzzed, shouting vocals. That's not a critique of the album. If you like that kind of music, it's probably pretty good. I've just had enough loud, angry people in my life that I don't need to buy a record of it. I appreciate milder stuff, which is what I was hoping for. Something like The Shins or even Radiohead (yeah, they have some angry music, but it's more tempered and musical). There *are* a few poplike songs on the disc (track 1,3,10). So that's really about it. Just a warning to those who aren't looking for strutting, harsh rock. To those who do, rock on!
B00008CLOA|5.0|Simply put, this cd is perfect.  Every song is put in the perfect place, there is no wasted space and none of the songs are weak.  What is amazing, with the exception of maybe the song MONEY, there isn't a song that stands alone, they are so perfectly interlocked with each other.  From 'Breath' to 'Eclipse' the whole album is a tapestry of well thought out and executed music making.<br />There isn't any other rock release that is better, or equal.<br />Amazing how well it was put together.  It stayed in the charts for a long time for an obvious reason, everyone discovers it and can't put it down, and shows it to friends.
B00005YW4H|4.0|I admit; I've had my moments of hatin' on Norah.  8 Grammy's was absurd, particularly for a an artist that wrote..what?...two songs on her album.<br />That said, this is still a solid album that is mellow without being monotonous, yet moving without being sappy.  The songs are excellent, lyrically and melodically.  She also has an exellent knack for interpreting the songs in the way she chooses to sing the song.  The same songs, theoretically, could of fallen flat with a different singer.  I can't say there is one bad song on the whole album.  And &quot;I've Got to See You Again&quot; almost made we want to stand up and wave my arms in the air.  Another stand out is &quot;Seven Years,&quot; a breath of fresh air that vicariously watches an innocent child.<br />Buy it. listen, love it.
B00005JKZU|2.0|I'm actually rather loth to give this two stars, since it was such a rotten movie.  This should not have been called the Two Towers; call it something else, because it did not accurately portray the book at all.  Tolkien would be rolling in his grave.  Since when did Faramir become worse than Boromir?  Why would a Wringwraith be scared away from taking the One Ring (that is being handed to him) by a measily little arrow?  Why is Frodo seen as being very weak?  Why do the Ents decide not to attack Isengard?  Why does Aragorn needlessly fall over the cliff?  In referance to that, why is he still alive when he does?  Why does Arwen show up so much when she's hardly seen in the books?  Why is Eown not stunningly beautiful like Tolkien says in the book?  Why is every orc enormous?  Even the Urak-hi were not supposed to be man high.  And why in the name of all that is good and beautiful, why does the movie skip the last half of the book entirely?  <BR>     People may say that it's a good movie if you don't think of it as being 'The Two Towers.'  I beg to differ.  It has no plot and the acting clashes with itself.  What a waste in millions of dollars.  Even more sad is the delusion of millions of people that they think that they know all about the Lord of the Rings.
B00004ZD69|5.0|Who knew progressive rock would make a comeback. If you remember the heavy, pretentious music of Yes, Gentle Giant and King Crimson with fondness, as I do, then this is welcome news indeed. In the late 90s a number of groups from odd countries have been reviving the genre and adding their own new twists. Godspeed You Black Emperor, a variable group from 9 to 18 musicians from Montreal, is one of the most interesting of these new-prog groups.<br />Lift Your Skinny Wrists is a double CD, lasting about 90 minutes in total. On the disc you will find GYBE's trademarks...long droning instrumental tunes which build up to shattering climaxes and then morph into new ostinati that repeat the process. New-Prog in general uses a mixture of traditional instruments, new instrumental techniques and influences from noise-rock to create it's textures. The variety in GYBE's music doesn't come in the forms or melodies, but in this fascinating build up of complex textures and in the powerful rhythmic drumming, which helps to develop the powerful crescendos. <br />Each track on the disc is around 20 minutes long, forming a sort of non-stop suite. Tracks are also distinguished by the use of found sounds...the sounds of an automated voice warning shoppers at a connivance mart not to let homeless people pump their gas...an older man's recollections of the heyday of Coney Island...a new-age preacher talking about the transformation of Man into God...a backwoods folk singer. One gets the feeling that there is a story behind the recording...a program of sorts, perhaps related to GYBE's left-wing political slant. But the album can be enjoyed without any knowledge of that. This is beautiful rock...played with conviction and intensity. If you like Sigur Ros or Mogwai, Godspeed You Black Emperor should also be your cup of tea.
B00005JLTN|5.0|What is everyone talking about?  How can you write The Matrix Reloaded such bad reviews.  Tell me another movie that has better special effects with an interesting plotline.  Im not like a Matrix nerd or anything, but I am disappointed in those who feel they have to give this movie less than five stars.  For those who haven't seen it, don't listen to these fools.  Buy it and you will like it.  This movie more than lives up to the first one and I can't wait for the third one to come out.  I also suggest the Lord of the Rings series.  The Matrix series and the Lord of the Rings are the best movies out.    BUY IT!
B00006AW2J|5.0|First my 2 cents on whether this is their best album. Oh yea, it most definately is. I think anyone who listens to music for the sake of music would agree. This album tugs and twists you like nothing else ever published. Period. <br />What I found on this cd that I didn't fully appreciate after 1,000+ listens on vinyl:<br />SFD: The percussion and bass work.<BR>NE: I find the Claves really get me.<BR>DD: The accoustic guitar work on this piece is awesome. This used to be a filler to drink beer to; now I listen real close.<BR>PW: The base on this piece is something else. It now stands out front and drives the whole tune. My appreciation for this tune jumped about three notches.<BR>JSP: Not much different, but the Melletron stuff is much clearer, not that anyone cares ;-)<BR>SFM: Nothing specific, but all kinds of little weird sounds pop out that I never heard before. Sounds real good!<BR>PS: The drums! Can barely hear them (never did before), and I find them almost haunting. The harmonica high notes.<BR>SCB: Just sounds better.<BR>FG: Nothing. Maybe the others are standing out more, but even though I enjoy the song, I like it a little less now. <BR>SOE: A tune I rarely listened to closely, and I never really picked up on the Mick/Keith duet before on the middle verses. <br />Overall, I find this cd demands to be listened to closely, much more so than vinyl. It's one of the few must buys on this planet!
0575073217|5.0|Alright, so I'm in the bookstore hoping to find something along the lines of a Stephenson or a Gibson, something that's in too short supply lately. I noticed Altered Carbon, which unfortunately sat in a none-too-noteworthy section, which is a shame. This book belongs front and center; it's a display of one of the most promising writers to come along in this genre for a long time. I truly loved the story, and hope to not have to wait too long for the sequel (apparently available in the UK right now!) You WILL NOT be disappointed in this book if you hunger for something in the genre.<br />All that said, here is my only complaint, and it's really pedantic. I like to really get inside the head of one character and stay there, and have other characters slowly introduced one by one. In Altered Carbon, while the author is a master at slipping in the artifacts of the universe in a deft manner, ala Dan Simmons, he unfortunately splashes a deluge of characters on you. I found myself more than once paging backward to get a refresher on who someone was. But really, this is a small gripe. Richard Morgan has created a universe in which he will be able to grab tales out of for what I hope is a very long time to come.

B00008NRLX|4.0|Rainy Day Music is a pleasing return from the Jayhawks, and a definite improvement upon the slightly disappointing Smile, their last album. It's an album full of quality songwriting, and is possibly their most accessible record yet, which should please both existing fans and newcomers alike. 'Stumbling Through the Dark', 'Tail Spin' and 'Eyes Of Sarahjane' are all great tunes with memorable melodies, something we have come to expect from the talented Gary Louris. Elsewhere Tim O'Reagan chips in nicely with the Lennon-esque 'Don't Let the World Get In Your Way', and 'Tampa To Tulsa'.  As a whole, Rainy Day Music may not be quite as sublime as Hollywood Town Hall or Tomorrow The Green Grass but it still has it's fair share of winning hooks and lovely compositions. I'm just happy that this accomplished band is still making music.
0452282152|5.0|This was such a good story.  Chevalier is an intelligent writer, definitely brought to life the painter and the supposed girl in the painting.  I won't go on and on about it, I just don't have words to describe how much I love her books, or why.  I just tell everyone they need to read this.
1883217040|5.0|This book was one of the best purchases I've made in years.  The information covered, the explainations, and use of classic jazz tunes to illustrate the information make this book a necessity. <br />My only change I would make to this book is the plastic binding is too flexible.  If you try to hold the book up it will start to flop over.<br />If you are into Jazz and want something to help you learn more or something to inspire some fresh ideas this is the book to get.
B00001MXWX|5.0|I was really pleasantly surprised when I saw Star Trek developing into a higher level of story lines and incorporating new age ideals. This movie is one that has a few levels - if you're looking for an amazing story  - the story is one that you have seen or read in the past - but what have they said:<br />&quot; There are only 12 story lines anyway&quot; and they keep getting redone. But there is another subtler level of energy work here that I really enjoyed. The REAL story line, in my opinion here, was the quest for the perfect moment as opposed to the conquest of the universe. Isn't that what was really discussed? Now I don't think that it was done very deeply because it might have been lost on many - but I'm one who enjoys the SF jenre along with the fantasy part of it.<br />You'll enjoy this for the newness of it if you let yourself - and it will get you thinking long after you watch it - again if you allow youself!
078322804X|5.0|Honestly, this is one of the best movies I have ever seen.  The movie is about to broters, Jake and Elwood Blues who were in a band, but it was boken up after Jake was sent to jail.  On the day that he came back, a nun who raised him needs $5,000 to keep her orphanage running.  So, the Blues Brothers must put there band back together to get the money.  This leads to the most bizare, hillarious, and my favorite car chases of all time.  This movie is a must see and buy.  It is true, the extra time makes the movie seem drawn out, but it's ok.  I would recommend you buy the dvd and rent the original on vhs.  So overall, great, great movie.
B0000087QO|5.0|On the basis of their first two albums the debate was whether Blondie would best be described as a punk band or a new wave band.  Such labels became immaterial with their third album in 1978, \\"Parallel Lines.\\"  This time around the producer was Mike Chapman, whose previous successes included \\"Ballroom Blitz,\\" and who made it clear that Blondie was a pop band.  The caustic lyrics that highlighted the early albums are replaced by a concerted effort by singer Deborah Harry to be more sultry in her singing.  Blondie might have were an edgy pop band, no doubt, but clearly now a pop band.  However, what makes this Blondie's best album is not just the production values but the songwriting, which pops up in several combinations.  Harry and Christ Stein wrote \\"Heart of Glass,\\" Stein came up with \\"Sunday Girl\\" by himself while Harry and new bass player Nigel Harrison penned \\"One Way or Another,\\" and Jack Lee (who was not even a member of the band) wrote \\"Hanging on the Telephone\\" and \\"Will Anything Happen?\\"  Having enjoyed some chart success in the U.K. Blondie saw \\"Heart of Glass\\" hit #1 on the Billboard charts in America and \\"One Way or Another\\" made it to #24.  You can make a good argument that \\"Heart of Glass\\" is the song that moved punk/new wave from cult status to the mainstream of rock 'n' roll music, even though it makes more than a passing nod towards disco.<br />But the true test of any really good album is that there are songs that are not released as singles that are as good as the hits, and you get that here with \\"Fade Away and Radiate,\\" \\"Just Go Away,\\" and \\"Picture This.\\"  The album made it to #6 on the Billboard charts and was followed by \\"Eat to the Beat,\\" which is almost as good but not quite.  Add to the mix Harry's recording of \\"Call Me,\\" the theme from the movie \\"American Gigolo,\\" and Blondie had gone from obscurity to being one of the hottest bands on the face of the planet.  In 1978 if you wanted to pick one album to reflect where music was at that point in the history of the known universe, Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" is probably the best choice you can make.nt in the history of the known universe, Blondie's \\"Parallel Lines\\" is probably the best choice you can make.
B000099T2L|5.0|I really enjoy this cd,even though there are some tracks that could have been replaced like &quot;That's how you like it&quot; ft Jay-Z.Beyonce adds club bangers and laid-back tracks to the CD.My favorite songs are &quot;Me Myself and I&quot;,&quot;Baby Boy&quot;,&quot;Hip Hop Star&quot;,&quot;Speechless&quot;, and &quot;Signs&quot;.Beyonce is a great writer and it really shows on this album. She also has a duet with Luther Vandross that gives a mature attribute to the album.I recommend this album to everyonce its not the typical verses that Destiny's Child is known for. It shows Beyonce's growth from Destiny's Child and stardom. In the future I hope the new cd from Destiny's Child is just as good.
B000002UA5|3.0|I Set The Controls For The Heart Of The Sun and regrettably found this album lacking. How could any self-respecting record company release this: there are no good looking women in the band and I'd hazard to guess that these guys can't even dance. Would be better if they stayed within the 3- minute format and had catchier hooks. Lyrical content might be made to include references to branded goods (i.e. Gucci, Lexus, Crystal champagne) thereby creating the potential for better promotional activities.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I have tried to not think about the stage show and the story of this album, and just listen to the music, and I love it. I think it is one of the best Neil Young albums ever, and I have been following them all since his 1st. It is one of his most compelling albums ever, and a great listen.
B000068IEU|5.0|To begin this review, let me just say to the fellow reviewers, that this is the film that really started the teen slasher genre. (Then came texas chainsaw massacre). This is such a great and underated movie! It really is good (in a sick sort of way.) Another thing, if you all wan't to see the version that was banned from theater's, by the the unrated director's cut. It is totally awsome. The transfer and sound were great.<BR>Again I say to you, see this movie, it really is worth the hour and half that it takes to watch it. <br />peace out.
0671027344|5.0|This is my favorite book of all time! It is amazing! When you are reading it, it feels like you are a part of the story! It was really hard to put down! I really hope they make a sequel! I reccomend this book to anyone! It will touch your heart!
B000002PH1|5.0|This was one of the first soft rock cd's I ever listened to and it still has a place in my heart. If you had to start with one of Belinda's cd's pick this one up you will not regret doing so.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron maiden has again proved that they are the best in heavy metal,, This album is amazing like the BRAVE NEW WORLD,, Although all the songs are good,, personally the ones i like the most are DANCE OF DEATH, RAINMAKER and WILDEST DREAMS,,<br />This album is a must for all heavy metal fans!!
B00008NRI8|4.0|Nobody these days make good movies anymore. But this movie is awesome. I like Hugh Grant even though sometimes I can not understand what he is saying. But I always love Sandra Bullock. Because she keeps it real. This is a great movie to add to either your VHS or you DVD.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|From the first chord, this is a true return to form for Maiden.I'm talking Piece of Mind form. But there's a little something more to Dance of Death. You know how even the best Maiden albums were a little on the clean side production wise. Well this record effing crunches with the best of them - think Black Label Society's 1919 Eternal. Classic Maiden, improved production...UP THE IRONS!!!
B00008EY9G|5.0|My wife and I had twin boys last year.  We're happy and all; Tired, the house is messy, we're tired, the cat hasn't come out from under the bed since the boys came home and, by the way... We're tired.<br />We miss a clean house, sleeping and the cat, but there's one thing that I really, truly and deeply miss.  Our weekly movie outings.<br />We would see (almost) everything that came out.  Comedy, action adventure, romance, art house stuff.  We were addicted to films good and bad.  The only thing we didn't see much together was horror.  Wifey would send me along with a couple of dollars for popcorn with a friend of mine or even by myself.  (Want to get scared in a theater?  See a good horror flick solo.)  Well, Identity came out on DVD last week and I HAD to go buy it.  I had heard wonderful things about this film when it came out and I knew it would be something I would love.  This was a flick that I wanted desperately to see in a theater, but it disappeard faster than it takes me to change a diaper.  Well, no excuses now.  I had it ona bright, shiny new DVD.  I suspected I might even be able to get wifey to enjoy it with me.  Right.<br />The same day it came out a local DJ talked about it on his morning drive-time show and let out a minor spoiler about a head that gets found somewhere.  He went on to say that if you're alone in a house after seeing this you won't sleep for at least a week after.  Convincing her would now be next to impossible.  (Thanks Lander in the Morning!!)<br />After literally hours of cajoling, bribery attempts and finally guilt (always save guilt for last) she caved, wrapped herself up in a blanket, latched on to my arm and settled in for a night of Hitchcockian suspense.<br />The head did make us both jump, the baseball bat made me laugh and her cringe, the scenes with the car crashes scared the bejeezuz out of both of us and by the end we were both smiling like idiots.  She looked at me as the credits rolled and said, &quot;Okay.  You win.That was really great.&quot;  I did, and it was.<br />Identity is what Hitchcock would be making were he alive today.  It is a complete reinvention of the suspense thriller, yet a homage as well.  Ten Little Indians meets Friday the Thirteenth.  There is no way to review this film, or even make more comparisons without giving away huge plot points.  One thing I will say is that the marketing for this movie was spot on.  In an age where entire plots, suprise endings and huge revelations are given away in trailers and TV spots, Identity's advertising was incredibly refreshing.  You will not see the ending coming.  I got it about fifteen minutes before the end and just sat there smiling.  The script is tight and very well written.  The acting is amazing with nary a weak performance in the lot.  Direction was perfect.  The hints that become obvious in a second viewing are subtle and border on hidden on the first.  <br />Great flick.  Great time, and I didn't even have to do the dishes!
0316666343|5.0|This is an extraordinary book. You will not be able to put it down. A heartbreaking and heartwarming book.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|You are probably wondering what the hell the Everglades have to with Dance of Death. Well, you will just have to purchase the album to figure it out, and if you are a true Maiden fan, this is a must have.<br />This is, with out a doubt, the most ambitious album the band has ever put out, and that is saying a lot considering some of the epics they have recorded!<br />Strap on your seatbelt a get ready to hit the open road with the 1st track, a straight forward rocker titled \\"Wildest Dreams\\", after this song you will be thrown on a Maiden rollercoaster of sound and emotion that will have you playing the album again right after it's first run-through.<br />I can honestly say that these are some of the most \\"introspective\\" offerings I have ever heard from the band. There is no doubt in my mind that they did a lot of soul searching and poured quite a bit of themselves into these songs. That is not to say they have not done this in the past, but you will understand what I mean when you listen to the album for the first time.<br />Great tempo changes, roaring riffs, incredible vocal range, f'cking balls out rock and roll. It's all here for you.<br />The question is... are you ready to dance the Dance of Death?
B00004RFCM|5.0|Title says what it's about.  Never watched this series before.  It's really quite entertaining.  I enjoy it.  Only it's one very narrow minded show.
B00005T30L|3.0|I have a feeling this story is much better in its original form (as a comic book), and just didn't translate well into film.  While attracted to the whole &quot;teenage misfits&quot; concept, I simply found the two lead characters (played by Thora Birch and Scarlet Johanssen) to be flat and uninteresting.  Their sarcastic barbs and &quot;scathing irony&quot; are not all that funny, and it seems they're only being used to fill a vacuum.  That may be the point, but I also thought the plot lines were way too neat and tidy for a supposedly real-life movie.  A lot of the other characters were deliberately cliche and predictable, with occasionally humorous results, but again more suited to comic books than live action movies.  Probably worth watching once, but don't expect to be blown away.
B000002HRE|4.0|Alot of people would say that Load was a disappointment but was still better than Reload.  I would have to say that Reload is the better album, myself, though.  Yes, I'll admit, I said that Reload was a shame on Metallica when I first heard the few songs that I heard on it, but my cousin told me that it was good if you actually listen to it, so I did and realized that it really was.  Sure, it's not Master of Puppets, or any of their old hardcore stuff, but it's a great album and deserves it's credit.  Besides, I really don't think you would want to create the same-old-same-old-style music, now, would you?  Reload just happened to be something different.  Give it a try, you might like it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I bought this album yesterday(9/8/03), I did not know what to expect from it and sure enough I was in for a surprise.  I've listened to it about 6 times and I enjoy it more each time.  The songs are great, my favorites are DoD, Montsegur, Rainmaker, Passchendale. Nicko's song is pretty good as well. His &quot;tub thumping&quot; Just gets better and better.  Another highlight of this album are the guitar melodies:Davey ,Steve,   Jan and H do such great work on their axes. I love that riff Janick does in unison with Bruce's singing on Montsegur. Bruce is incredible on this album, His singing is so emotional that at times I feel like the hair on my neck will stand up. While listening to this album one will notice many influences from albums past.  If you consider yourself a maiden fan make sure you buy this album. if  You're just starting to listen to them get the Albums &quot;Iron maiden&quot;, &quot;Killers&quot;, #oTB,&quot;Piece of mind&quot; or &quot;Powerslave&quot;, those are great places to start and you cant go wrong.
B000069HK2|5.0|this whole cd is great! i was getting really tired of those wanna be punk bands like AAR and stuff then a real punk band came out and theyre awesome!! this cd is the best one i own! i recommend it to everyone!!
B00004XMV6|5.0|What can I possibly say that hasn't already been said.  Great movie that open my eyes to just how great it could be to fulfill fantasies and the consequences that not saying how you feel can have.  Granted when I first was the movie I was a 17 year old college freshman and still very virginal.  The music for the movie was just as good as the movie.  A must own for anyone who likes Mickey.
B00000JPH6|5.0|I saw this movie when I was in college.  I was completely spellbound.  The creativity and story line were excellent. It seems that people I've spoken to either love it or hate it.  If your not into childrens fantasy then don't waste your time.  You won't like it.  I have enjoyed reading the reviews on this movie.  It reminds me that in this world no matter how much I may like something, nor how many others may like it as well, there will always be those that hate it.  But then again most people loved \\"Ferris Beullers Day Off\\" whereby I thought it was one of the most dreadful movies ever produced.
B00004Y6O9|5.0|More than anything, this romperstomper of an album was the coming-out party for the 80s' best guitarist, and one of the top 5 most innovative guitars of all time: Eddie Van Halen. Aside from the brilliant songs, every one a classic, it was a showcase for Eddie's enormous skills on the guitar: fiery, melodic, and very fun. Listening to these songs is like being 17 in 1978, cruising all night and smoking dope, living it up. In my opinion, no rock album reaches the sheer zenith of this high-flying album, the band on top of their game and loving every minute of it. 34 minutes of the best rock ever made.
B0000640VO|5.0|This film is just right, like the warm cup of tea on a cold night, or the first sunny day after weeks of rain. I own the DVD and have seen it several times, and each time it fills me with a kind of wonder. It is the kind of timeless and pure story that made Hollywood great, but that Hollywood doesn't make any more.<br /><br />Aside from a handful of cynics, I can't imagine anyone who won't enjoy Amelie. But here's a test: if you, like the films main character, can take joy from life's simple pleasures (like the way your hand feels sinking into a sack of dried beans, the way street markets sound and smell, the absurdity of a horse running with the Tour de France), then this is a simple pleasure you don't want to miss.<br /><br />As far as the quality and value of this film, I can't add much to the hundreds of reviews already posted here except to say \\"Yes! Yes! Me too!\\"<br /><br />An interesting side note: the more I watch the film, the more little cultural references and word plays I catch. I'm sure the film is full of them, but I think it would take a native French speaker or long-time Paris resident to catch them all (understanding them is not necessary to enjoy the film; they're a bonus).<br /><br />One I caught on the most recent viewing on TV (my French is sketchy, but seeing it with Italian subtitles rather than the English helped) is a play on words by Hippolito, the failed writer in the cafe, who comments that the cafe's regulars speak about the weather out of fear of the passing time. In French, \\"temps\\" means both \\"time\\" and \\"weather.\\"<br /><br />Similarly, the grocer Collignon tells Amelie to contact his mother to discover the name of her apartment's former tennent. He says, \\"Elle a une memoire d'elephant, un elephant de mer.\\" That translates to \\"She has a memory like an elephant, a sea elephant\\" -- a reference to a manatee or an seal. But the point is the way Collignon stresses \\"mer\\" (which means \\"ocean\\"), which sounds the same as \\"mere\\" (which means \\"mother\\").<br /><br />I also noticed that the voice over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful. I peaked at the credits and found that he is Frederic Mitterrand, the nephew of the late prime minister.<br /><br />The last might be a stretch, but on my last trip to Paris I noticed a old-time chocolate brand called \\"Poulain\\", which is Amelie's family name. Maybe that's just a coincidence, but with a film as sweet as this one, assuming they come from the same source is an easy mistake to make.ce over used when Amelie imagines the television retrospective of her life is from the same person who does the television commentary for the funerals of France's rich, famous, and powerful.

B0000A1RJI|5.0|I agree with the fact that it was much to short... The music is absolutly AMAZING!! I love numbers 4, 10, and 15 the most. <br />This was  the first time I had ever heard of Klaus Badelt, and I am astounded with the results. I bought The Time Machine even though I never saw the movie, and LOVED it. I would recommend it to anyone who liked this soundtrack! <br />The movie was also wonderful. I've seen it 3 times already! (I'm only 15, so yes, i see movies more than once...)<br />I recommend this soundtrack to EVERYONE!! It is also good, if you liked the music from Lord of the Rings, by Howard Shore.
B00005YXZH|5.0|Possibly the most famous album with a back story released in 2002, and one that gave a record companies a bad name once and for all, Wilco's oft-maligned \\"experiment\\" is a smart, daring, complete work of art. Somewhat ironically, but very fittingly, their most successful one as well. Say what you want about the electronic noises (I was expecting so much more!), but this album has some of Wilco's strongest songs.
B000003BD3|4.0|The stones are vapid, Lennon is interesting especially since it was his first time live without the Beatles, but make no mistake about it, The Rolling Stones Rock and Roll Circus is a promotional Who video.<br />If you've ever wondered what the Who were like live and up close you will see in this video.<br />The 4 distinct peronalities are evident and the anger that drives much of rock and roll is captured in a way that makes your skin tingle.<br />Townshend and Moon are nothing short of volcanic. Witnessing them live up close must have been almost traumatic in its effect.
B00004T37H|5.0|This is one of the best films I've ever seen.  For those of you who like fantasy and adventure you will be glued to the screen for the duration.  The action is non-stop and full of suprises.  There are many compelling characters, the sound track is excellent and the story is top notch.<br />The film opens when the last young warrior called Ashitaka of a village notices something unusual in the woods approaching his village.  Some sort of mysterious beast makes himself known and begins to attack Ashitaka and begins chasing him.  This is no ordinary beast, it appears to change form and consists of a bunch of worm-like creatures.  Everything in its path is destroyed with ease.  While Ashitaka tries to defend his village, he manages to shoot the beast with two arrows which eventually incapacitate it, but not without a cost.  While Ashitaka was defending his village and attempting to keep the beast away, some of the worm-like creatures grab hold of his arm and cause him great pain leaving an unusual scar.  Later, after consulting with the wise woman of the village, Ashitaka is informed that he has been cursed by an evil spirit and is in grave danger.  There is however one chance of him curing himself.  To cure himself, he must travel to a far away land and find the great benevolent spirit of the forest.  On his journey to finding the great spirit, he faces many trials and tribulations, meets friend and foe but most of the people he meets are consumed with anger and hate which makes it all the more difficult and adds an element of complexity to the story.<br />The film makes two very powerful points about man and his quest to dominate nature and about the consuming and destructive power of hate and anger.  The destruction of nature can only lead to man's own destruction and anger merely fuels more anger and hate which if not stopped will completely consume the individual.
0805066691|5.0|A must read.  This should be required reading in school.  I will never forget this book.
B00004Y6OA|4.0|Third album, third platinum success for Van Halen. Picking up where they left from, these rockers churned out another solid album in 1980, beginning their reign in fine style. This album features the full-blooded roar of \\"...And the Cradle Will Rock\\", and \\"Everybody Wants Some\\". While this album does have a couple of fillers, it also has the seeds of Van Halen's burgeoning experimentation with keyboards that would eventually bloom in \\"1984\\". While not as brilliant as their first two hell-raisers, this was another fine step for the premier hard rock band of the 1980s.
0060516402|5.0|Wow! What a book.  In it the authors look at visionary companies and what separates them from their top competitors. This is not a book about charismatic leaders or dynamic products, but a book about vision, values and risk taking. It is a book that every buinessman and pastor ought to read.<br />For the pastor of a church the greatest strength of Built to Last is that it is a book about business not about the church.  The concepts of vision, quality, excellence, leadership training, and of risk taking are all biblical concepts.  If God honors non-Christiand when they act according to His principles, how much more will He honor the church of the Living God?<BR> <BR>This book is filled with hundred of specific examples how these principles transformed ordinary businesses into visionary companies.  The contrast between the visionary companies and their competition is sobering. As I read how the ordinary competition would shoot themselves in the foot time and time again, the picture of the local church came to my mind.  The failure to establish vision, to articulate core values, to promote a team atmosphere, and to maintain consistent pastoral leadership has resulted in mediocre churches. <br />This book seemed to be dealing with something that small rural pastors would never deal with, being a visionary church. But the more I thought about it, the more I realized that the size of the church is irrelevant. The question is: Are we doing great things for God?  What are we trying to do that would only be possible if God were in it.  <br />This book is must reading for every leader, whether he or she leads a business or nonprofit organization.
B00004XQP4|4.0|First off, let me say that most other reviews you read on here are less than accurate reflections on a great album. To tell you the truth it took me  awhile to get comfortable with this album, at first the title track bothered me and not until I reached the sixth track did I really start to enjoy this one, that's not to say that the first five aren't good songs, they are in their own right and I think that &quot;warning&quot; is a great acoustic punk song and &quot;church on sunday&quot; is a good reflection on the compromises we make for one another. The crowning acheivement on this record(in my humble opinion) has got to be misery, a well written comic song about four people whose lives all intertwine in some way and they all have one thing in comon...it all ends in misery &quot;...and they're gonna get high/when they're low low low/she screams why oh why/I say I don't know...&quot; one of the best lines on the album. The track following, &quot;Deadbeat Holliday&quot;, is a song about how everything around us is just dead or dying and our grudges are the noose that will kill us in the end &quot;...christmas lights in the middle of august/grudges come back to haunt us...grounded in a duplex to find you're living on a landmine...&quot; &quot;Hold on&quot; is just what it sounds like it's a song encouraging the listener that no matter what he/she may be going through to &quot;hold on&quot;. &quot;Waiting&quot; this is probably one of my favorites on the album just about the realization of our dreams. &quot;Minority&quot; this is not only a great peice of pop-punk it is also a very poetic song about non-conformity. The ending ballad &quot;macy's Day Parade&quot; is a song reflecting on those things that when we are younger thought would make us happier (i.e. money, clothes, fame) but we come to th erealization sooner or later that what we have is all we ever really need or want...this album will leave you content, if you are a true green day fan, this album is for you, if you don't even like pop-punk, this album is still worth a listen.
0783235968|5.0|I agree with the many reviewers who have highlighted this movie's incredible ability to touch emotions that few films do.  What I liked just as much was how unpredictable the storyline is.  Most movies follow a fairly standard plot where you can see what's coming around the next bend.  This is totally different.  If you've never watched it, see by yourself or with someone who's never seen it either.  You will be wondering through most of the movie where the story is going, but in a way that keeps you riveted to it, eagerly waiting for the payoff.  Think of it as an emotional and thought-provoking rollercoaster that you've never seen, and you're riding it with your eyes closed.  This is one heck of a film.
B000001FS3|5.0|Although I sometimes feel this album is dark at spots, it is nonetheless a tremendous achievement for this Irish band. It contains a couple of their best songs in &quot;Where the Streets Have No Name&quot;, &quot;I Still Haven't Found...&quot;, and &quot;With or Without You&quot;. That's just the first three songs! Bono is very passionate, singing about politics and government, love, death and drugs. The music is spot-on and their world tour was massive. This album established them as megastars and is still considered perhaps their best album. Very good album, pick it up today.
B000088E6D|2.0|I first heard cuts from this album while shopping at a bookstore, specifically &quot;Come Fly With Me&quot; and &quot;The Way You Look Tonight.&quot;  My opinion was and is that he has a good voice, excellent pitch and an obvious affection for the genre, but there was a lack of convicition and style a la Sinatra or Sammy Davis Jr.<br />I'm disappointed with most of the rest, especially &quot;Crazy Little Thing&quot; because of the echoplex or reverb.  If he's just going to be imitative, why bother?  Why not do something different?  He's got a good voice and a capable backup band...  <BR>I think that may be the fault of producer David Foster, who took the group Chicago from innovative to syrupy in a very short time.<br />I'm not happy at spending $20 and getting so little for my money (which I spent based on exposure to two of the best cuts).  However, He's got potential, and I look forward to having someone to help erase my memory of Sinatra's pitch problems.
B00005221M|3.0|I was very disappointed that this version of the film has cut critical scenes from the original that were intended to help develop the romantic courtship between Hawkeye and Cora.  If I had known that this was the case, I would have NEVER sold my VHS version to buy the DVD!<br />Although it is good movie overall, I would choose the original version all day long over this one.  If you have any desire to see this movie as it was originally shown, do yourself a favor and buy the VHS version.
0385504209|5.0|Apart from being well written, this fascinating book presents a lot of information on the ancient classics. Brown does an excellent job weaving his plot: a Harvard professor of symbology and a French police criminologist are on a mad pursuit to discover who killed the criminologist's grandfather, the prominent curator of the Louvre. The fact that the Harvard professor is the prime suspect adds further intensity to the plot. In a race against time to find the curator's murderer, astonishing facts surface about the curator. In the process of melding the plotline, Brown presents a fascinating array of true documented evidence on the Holy Grail, biblical and ecclesiastical history, secret societies, art symbology, and more. I had never heard of most of this evidence - I was fascinated to learn that such theories, and societies, existed.<br />Apart from the historical interest, however, this is just a plain great mystery read - Brown's style flows and is effortless. He also presents his plots in pieces and jumps around to different scenes frequently - this means you don't have time to get bored. And not without coincidence, this means you have to just keep reading if you are interested in a particular plot but keep being interrupted. No unnecessary embellishments or pedantry in his writing style at all - a good clean mystery that guarantees to please!
B00004Y6O7|5.0|Van Halen's fourth album is one of their least-appreciated works even though it contains some of their best songs. It also marks the first time Eddie perfected his patented &quot;brown sound&quot;, his guitars rich and heavy with melody and grit. &quot;Mean Streets&quot; is a heavy-handed stomper of an opener, a tough riff highlighted by Alex and Mike's rock-solid rhythym section and Diamond Dave's menacing lyrics. &quot;Unchained&quot; is the big hit from this album, perhaps the lightest, more fun song from this album and was a concert staple during their last tour. The last two songs explode with drama, loaded with dark organ work and represent a huge change from Van Halen's usual sound. An excellent album that every Van Halen fan should have.
B00005JKHN|3.0|Once again Disney, aka the Evil Empire, shows why they cannot be beat when it comes to dvds. They do it right each time. Sleeping Beauty leaps off the screen with vivid color and sharp lines. Kiss your VHS version goodbye. And having a choice between the widescreen and fullscreen versions is great. The purist in me goes for widescreen whilst my wife and daughter choose full.<BR>That said, this is Disney's lamest Princess movie. Aurora is a cipher, there and yet not there, no personality at all. Flora, Fauna and Merryweather are the true leads of this story. More should've been done with Maleficent; wasted potential here.<BR>Now for the lack of logic.<BR>First if \\"before the sunsets on her 16th birthday she shall prick her finger on the spindle of a spinning wheel and die,\\" could not the fairies have waited til the day AFTER to bring Aurora home? But then, no sleeping, I guess.<BR>Second, Maleficent's goons have been searching for 16 years for Aurora, but as a baby. Now, wouldn't Maleficent, in those 16 years, at least ask once how things are going, instead of waiting all that time and then asking? This is a problem of poor business management. A good villainess would have appointed a head henchman and have him report to her on a daily or weekly basis.<BR>Third, the 3 fairies have no clue how to bake a cake or make a dress for Aurora's 16th birthday. Well, who was cooking for all those years? And didn't they even attempt to bake a birthday cake the prior 15 times? And who made Aurora's outfit in which she goes gathering berries and meets Prince Philip? Sears?<BR>Fourth, why doesn't Prince Philip speak anymore after telling King Hubert he's going to marry Aurora? Listen carefully; he does not speak for the rest of the movie after this point... come to think of it, neither does Aurora!<BR>Fifth, when Philip races to the castle with the fairies in tow he has to hack away at all the brambles to get through. Why doesn't Flora or Fauna or Merryweather just make them disappear? If they can turn spears into flowers, brambles disappearing should be cake (which they don't know how to bake. Maybe that's the problem...).<BR>Call me nit-picky but these things just leap out at me... why did I buy the dvd then? Because it was for my wife's birthday and this is her favorite movie in the whole world. Also, \\"Aurora\\" is our daughter's middle name... and I love my wife and daughter very much!
B00009V7T2|4.0|It might be well to establish a few things before actually reviewing this album.<BR>Number one, according to the media industry, this album is \\"pretentious\\".   We're not talking let's-toss-out-a-few-snide-Yes-comparisons-and-move-on pretentious.  We're talking yes-the-band-members-regularly-practice-self-flagelation-in-order-to-deal-with-the-massive-pretentions-undertaken-to-make-this-album-possible pretentious.  But it must be admitted, a large amount of this perceived \\"pretension\\" is due to the massive pre-album hype.  If Rolling Stone hadn't been hyping Comatorium up months before its release, we'd be much more kind-hearted in our words regarding the perceived musical humility, or lack thereof, on the part of everyone's favorite former At the Drive-In members.  <BR>That being said, the actual album.  Whether the world expected, was ready for, or wanted a post-post-punk-jazz-funk-noisecore fusion concept album opus, they got it.  Combining guess-who-got-high-while-studying-for-the-SAT-vocabulary-section lyrics with musical backing that thrashes, grooves, rages, runs upstairs to introspectively cry on its bed and whatever else you can think of, De-Loused in the Comatorium is in all likelihood the only album of its kind that will be released in 2003.  <BR>From the spacily confident and searching opener Son Et Lumiere, to the uber garage band acid trip jam session closing number Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt (and yes, if you can't deal with songs named like Take The Veil Cerpin Taxt, Mars Volta is not right for you), Mars Volta has completed an utterly radio inaccessible yet inexplicably catchy (well, catchy as post-punk acid trip jam band songs go) album for the ages.  Century.  Decade.  Next couple years.  Whatever.  It's a good album.  With a song named \\"Take the Veil Cerpin Taxt\\", it has to be.
B000084T18|2.0|WHAT IS ALL THE HYPE ABOUT!!! I DON'T GET IT!!!  NO LYRICAL SKILSS WHAT SO EVER!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!NONE!!!!  But hey, I like &quot;IN DA CLUB&quot; and &quot;21 QUESTIONS&quot;.  No Eminem..There would be no Fifty.   THANK GOD FOR DR. DRE AND GENEROUS RECORD DEALS.  BUT FIFTY WITH EMINEM IS LIKE HAVING EYORE FROM WINNIE THE POOH AGAINST BUGS BUNNY.  But I got respect for him, he can take a bullet.
B000003TBP|5.0|Like a kid in a candy store. At least that's how some people feel when listening to Beck's wildly eclectic, genre-hopping opus. A breath of fresh air if there ever was one, Odelay was a critical smash and unexpected commercial success when singles &quot;Where It's At&quot; and &quot;The New Pollution&quot; lit up the airwaves and MTV with creative videos and fresh sounds drawn from obscure funk samples and a fun approach to making new sounds. This is a rare album that still hits like a ton of bricks with its exhilarating creativity, especially when heard through headphones. The one thing working against it is that it's not an especially cohesive album: it reads more like a collection of fascinating short stories rather than a genius novel. But of course that shouldn't hinder anyone: they are very fascinating short stories indeed. Pure ear candy that does not rot the brain.
B0000AXE8I|5.0|The matrix was a good movie.good action, great plot....great graphics. Now The Matrix Reloaded...was way better..the fighting scenes were unbeliveable!!!!, they never showed the same thing over, but it had a little to much talking, and a whole lot of action. In my thought i think Reloaded was better than the first Matrix. But Revolutions which is the third installment should be way better than the two Matrix movies puit together...So reloaded was really good, fighting scenes just to much!!!, unbelivable....if you dont like the matrix, take a look at another movie called Equilibiran
0451207521|4.0|I have been a fan of Ken Follett for about 20 years. I have read all of his books except Night Over Water(partially read), Third Twin(started it 3 times), Hammer of Eden and Hornet Flight. <br />I think he should stick to WWII stories. <br />I never got into the Third Twin...I tried three times. I know an author never wants to be &quot;type-cast&quot; but this era (WWII) is his. He can enthrall a reader with the characters...the attention to detail...the feeling of BEING THERE. I give credit to The Eye of The Needle for turning me into a reader first and a writer second...it had that kind of an impact on me. Now on to Jackdaws...<br />I enjoyed the characters immensely and the pace of the book kept you into the story. The connections between the characters were well thought out. As usual, his attention to detail was very well crafted. I only had two main gripes about the book. <br />The first is the predictability of the storyline. Maybe being a writer I have honed that ability to foresee events before they shape up but I saw most of the events chapters ahead of their occurances. As an example...I knew from their first encounter that Flick and Paul would end up together...there's more but I don't want to ruin it for a potential reader. I was pleasantly surprized in a couple of instances but not a whole lot.<br />The second was the preoccupation with homosexuality. I chalked it up to &quot;attention to detail,&quot; assuming that maybe there was a lot of instances of homosexuality during the war. I am just as open as the next person...but I have to admit for a few chapters I was seriously considering putting the book down and not picking it back up. I understood the character that Greta played and it worked well within the story...and I understand the path used to get there (Flick's brother and his lifestyle)...but Diana and Maude kind of made me ask why. Although going back to my first complaint...I was very surprized by that development, not pleasantly, but surprized nonetheless.<br />All-in-all it was a good read that I enjoyed. Not on a par with Eye of the Needle, or my other favs Pillars of the Earth and Man From St. Petersburg...but still a very good effort.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Pretty amazing.  The album has everything that Iron Maiden is known for.  Everything from the classic radio hit: &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; to the sweeping epic song &quot;Dance of Death.&quot;  Albeit the album does fall short of their all time classics like Number of the Beast, Powerslave, and 7th Son, BUT, given recent albums in the metal genre, this one rises STRAIGHT to the top and is easily their best album since Bruce Dickinson's return to the band.  <br />A first for Iron Maiden, the dummer, Nick McBrian, writes his first song, &quot;New Frontier.&quot;  Wow what an amazing song.  He needs to write more.  From the words and Nicko being a born again Christian sounds like he's shedding a lot of feelings.  <br />The album is not the best they've ever done, but it's certainly in their top 5.  Many layers making them sound even more mature for a band doing this for over 20 years.  The three guitar sounds are FAR better then on the previous album and the use of orchestrated music really brings the whole album together.  As always there is an underlying theme here.  It's hard to pull out and may be a source of good discussion.  Dance of Death, songs about one last time, good times, great history.  Rumored to cut way back on touring after this world tour, could this be one of their last studio albums?  Hard to say, but it's a really decent album to go out on.
B00003CXSP|3.0|After ten years, the world waited eagerly for the sequel to the legendary THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS.  Finally, they have it - although I'm sure it's not at all what they expected.  HANNIBAL is the result of what most will see as a Ridley Scott-Anthony Hopkins-Hans Zimmer collaboration.  Adapted from Thomas Harris' best-selling (although much weaker) novel, HANNIBAL follows only the basic plot of the novel.  Anthony Hopkins returns to his Oscar-winning role as cannibal genius Dr. Hannibal Lecter, who is now roaming freely in Italy.  However, after many years he decides he'd like to come out of retirement; without spoiling any &quot;surprises&quot;, he attempts to make contact with FBI agent Clarice Starling (Julianne Moore, taking over from Jodie Foster), while running from his only surviving victim's (Gary Oldman) assassins.  Hopkins' performance is great and yet you can't help laughing at Dr. Lecter, so polite and yet the deadliest man alive; Moore tries her hardest, but she comes nowhere near close to taking up where Foster previously stood.  There is also a terrific score by Hans Zimmer; the highlight of the film, of course, however, is Scott's directing.  It may be the absolute weakest sequel THE SILENCE OF THE LAMBS could have, but HANNIBAL is still a frightening and effective horror thriller.
B00004VXF2|5.0|You'll read many reviews here dismissing MMM as an elaborate joke Lou pulled on pretentious posers salivating over the implicate 'art' value of the atonal noise that encompasses the recording's 60+ minutes. Hell, if it's 'difficult', it's gotta be 'art', right? Haw haw haw... what a character, that Lou. Kudos for ripping off a bunch of morons by releasing the first coffee table record: an unlistenable conversation piece for decadent trendies. Right? RIGHT? <br />Um... WRONG. <br />If it were only that simple, to live in such a simpleton world. But anyone with a clue can easily figure out why MMM matters. If your aesthetic already included things such as Hendrix, the Velvet Underground, The Stooges, Black Sabbath, King Crimson, and so on, this made perfect sense in context, as ambient music for people with noise-attuned ears (much like Eno's ambient does the same for those with pop-attuned ears). Sometimes you feel like a nut, sometimes you don't. Sometimes you want to hear something inspired by a malfunctioning record player set at a near-inaudible level in a hospital room (Eno) and sometimes you need a sound inspired by something a bit more substantial (Reed).  <br />Of course, to those who don't share the above aesthetic, MMM simply means that you paid X amount of dollars to own and listen to what sounds like a bunch of guitars and amps being thrown down a very long flight of stairs, or (as someone said back when this was first issued), 'the soundtrack of someone being administered electro-shock therapy for an hour'. Perhaps... but those reviewers mincing and squealing about how this is such a 'rip-off' probably don't see much in Pollock but a bunch of splattered paint, or get a headache from trying to read \\"Finnegan's Wake\\". Try to be charitable to them, even if they ARE clue-impaired to the point that they are obviously  resentful of what they just can't understand.<br />Truth is, we still ended up with Throbbing Gristle (who toned down the foreground treble andadded somewhat of a beat and 'lyrical content' to the concept), Einsturzende Neubauten and Test Department (who added everyday appliances to the mix, amped up the rhythmic aspects considerably, and re-incorporated a semblance of song structure) and Boyd Rice/Frank Tovey's EASY LISTENING FOR THE HARD OF HEARING (which dispenses with anything involving traditional instruments, and employs record player cartridges, tape snippets, and found sounds to create what are truly metal machine instrumental pop songs), just to name a few that emerged thereafter MMM hit the fans.<br />Would these things have happened without MMM being released? Is MMM truly valid as a retail item from an established singer/songwriter recording for the fine RCA label, or could any speed freak with enough time and equipment put this together? Does the fact that Lou already did it make that last point somewhat irrelevant? Is MMM the 'root' of 'industrial' music? Does Lou owe props to Ussachevsky and Luening, who were making similar noises in the early 50's? If so, is MMM Lou's 'musique concrete' album? <br />Whatever. Opinions are like the nether aperture: everyone's got one, and they all stink if you get right down to it. So I'll take MMM as Lou's attempt at noise-friendly ambient music, ideal shifting audio wallpaper that hangs around while I do everyday chores around the house. It's useful, it's utilitarian. It serves a purpose. And I, for one, am glad that it happened.
B00005JLSE|1.0|This movie was so awful it made no since. Everyone I was watching it with had no clue what was going on. We thought it would be better because we had watched Moulin Rouge and thought it was an awesome movie. We asumed with so many well known actors playing in the movie it couldn't be a dud but it was, so I would not recommend this movie to anyone unless you were bored out of your mind.
B00009P1O5|3.0|This was the second (and last) of Neil's &quot;contractual obligation&quot; LP's he delivered to Reprise.  Consisting entirely of studio outtakes, it still manages to lay some of the groundwork that bands from the Pacific Northwest would take to much higher levels.  &quot;Shots&quot; is a keeper.  The rest is for die-hard Neil fans, of which I am one.
B00005OAIE|5.0|john mayer combines great funky acoustics with lyrics ranging from provocative to amusing.  it's great fun to listen to in any mood. it reminds me of a boy a used to know, bob cantoni, a lyrical genious himself.  memories are always better with a soundtrack.  this one definitely delivers.  enjoy.
B0000AOV85|5.0|Although thirty years have passed since Dark Side Of The Moon was originally released, and it still seems to be impossible to get all four members of the band in the same room to discuss their meister work, this DVD is worth it for a number of reasons. First, there are the descriptions of how each track came into being, from Roger Waters' earliest demos in some cases, to the finished work. Second, there is the look of sheer joy on everybody's face as they discuss this incredible album, and demonstrate how tracks were built, piece by piece to make the finished product. (anyone doubting this should check the loving way Alan Parsons mans the faders as he describes building up the vocal tracks for &quot;Us And Them&quot;. Third, and probably most important of all, the fact that Roger Waters acknowledges the work of Rick Wright and Nick Mason after all these years.<br />Added to all of this, there is some marvelous contemporary footage of the band in the studio making the record (ah, didn't they look so young!!), and some archive audio footage of the piece being performed live (presumably when it was still called &quot;Eclipse&quot;).<br />There has been a lot of hype this year, justifiably, for an album which seems to continue to sell in whatever format it is available. Maybe the record companies should cap off this historic Pink Floyd year by releasing a live version of &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; from 1972 - they obviously have the tapes. For an old Floyd addict like me, that would cap everything off nicely.
B00005JM0B|5.0|Just when doubt had washed away many of our hopes of Arnold Schwarzenegger returning as the futuristic cyborg Terminator, his role as the imfamous human cyborg machine ushers him back into action and in many ways, redeems his career after several flops and an atrocity or two (Batman and Robin anyone?).<br />It all happens ten years after the pivotal events of the 1991 masterpiece Judgement Day when John Connor who has survived two major assassination attempts on him and is now living off the grid on the streets, completely closed off from the world. Connors life is once again put in grave danger when the machines send back a state of the art cyborg disguised as an innocent woman to kill John Connor in an attempt to finish the job that was failed by the first Terminator, and the T-1000. Meanwhile, the computer network Skynet is scheduled to be put into operation and link up all of the worlds computer systems but something goes horribly wrong when a massive computer virus wrecks the networks around the world and causes machines to go beserk and also threatens to cause nuclear Armageddon to occur when the machines, who seemingly develop a mind of their own, launch nuclear destruction all over the world.<br />Although this doesnt necessarily match the dizzying heights of Judgement Day, Rise Of The Machines makes a great successor and this is the darkest of the three Terminator movies.<br />The first Terminator movie, which Rise of the Machines is like a prequel to, is slightly stymied by some extremely dated production especially with the futuristic battle scenes. The spaceship scenes at the beginning of the first Terminator movie looked more like a plastic toy suspended on puppet strings than a science-fiction movie shot and made for some silly popcorn material. In T3, that same spaceship looks a lot more realistic. The production style of Judgement Day was a vast improvement and the movie was many years ahead of its time. Rise of The Machines is the same way although not as groundbreaking as the Judgement Day one.<br />Althought, it can apply to all three Terminator movies, Rise of The Machines is very unsettling in its storyline because it is very possible that a nuclear war could break out because of a computer glitch involving nuclear warheads technology. Because much of the defense industry relies on internet and computer networks, if the whole network goes haywire and/or stops working because of a technological malfunction or computer virus, the results could be catastrophic although maybe I might be a bit exaggerated.<br />Rise Of The Machines is a welcome addition to the Terminator series and while it may be the weakest of the three, it is still awesome and if its to be the last one in the series, it ends the series on a good note. Buy it when it comes out on DVD.s time.

B00008CLOA|5.0|OK, let's start this off with a little bit of negativity. To get the full benefit of this new edition, you probably need to have a 5.1 sound system. But that's about it as far as negativity goes.<br />Just for the record this is my 3rd edition of the Dark Side Of The Moon CD. I also own the regular LP and the Mobile Fidelity version, and was once the proud owner of a cassette version, until someone with sticky fingers lifted it!! But back to the CDs. I was one of the unfortunate people who got scammed by the record companies when Pink Floyd's back catalog was released on CD back in the late 80s. Can you believe that they created the CD from a record!! Actually, considering how much I played the LP in my youth, the CD sounded pretty good. Then it was improved upon with the remastered version (the one with the opaque prism, for anyone who's watching the sleeves as well). Now, there is a third version and what can I say.<br />Well, imagine if you can sitting in your bedroom with your stereo speakers so close together that there is literally no stereo separation. Now imagine moving into an apartment where you can spread the speakers out a little. Imagine my surprise and delight when I actually \\"heard\\" the album for the first time, with the planes sweeping across the stereo and the bags of cash dropping on the floor on either side of the room.<br />This is what this edition of the CD is like. It is like listening to the album for the first time again. Nothing has been taken out and a greater sparkle has been added. the clarity of the mix, even on a regular stereo, is unbelievable. Remastering and remixing albums sometimes takes something away from the original, but that is not the case here. Some areas seem to have been boosted a little, so, for example, the spoken words that the album was so famous for, are much more understandable than they ever were buried in the mix as they were.<br />But the mix and the mastering are not what makes this album what it is. A classic is defined by its longevity, and \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\" has certainly qualified on that count. The music still sounds remarkably fresh considering how old it is (thirty years + one year of touring it as \\"Eclipse\\"). The fact that it still sounds as good as it does is a tribute to Alan Parsons as much as it is to Roger Waters, David Gilmour, Rick Wright and Nick Mason. The band presented the music, and Parsons put it all together in such a way that, thirty years on, it still sounds like it was recorded yesterday.<br />I remember the first time I ever heard \\"Dark Side Of The Moon\\". It was before I even knew who Pink Floyd were. Someone played it for me and I got goose-bumps when Gilmour plays that solo in \\"Time\\". To say that I still get goose-bumps would be an understatement - it's just that it's all so much clearer now.<br />Imagine what this album would have been like had the Floyd had the technology in 1972 that they have today.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|many of us thought that BRAVE NEW WORLD  was gonna be the album for the reunited IRON MAIDEN and though it wasnt exactly a disappointment it wasnt anything remarkable either, all of which is a roundabout way of saying that it's successor DANCE OF DEATH ROCKS LIKE AN INSANE GORILLA IN A CLAUSTROPHOBIC CAGE during it's mating season, not a single filler outta here and what's more it'll get MAIDEN new fans without disappointing the older ones coz of it's progression (more mellifluous strings added).<BR>stndouts:<BR>paschendale<BR>rainmaker<BR>montsegur <BR>dance of death<BR>journeyman<BR>age of innocence<BR>new frontier -gr8 hummable chorus
B0000BYM3K|5.0|That's right...after 25 years of pure METAL!! Maiden still has what it takes to make a great album.  This is an album for True Fans and True Fans only.  If you are not a big, die hard, Give Me Ed...'Til I'm Dead Iron Maiden fan then I can already hear you saying how this album is not that great.  Trust me, This is a MUST buy and put next to your other Maiden albums.  It picks up right where Brave New World left off.  I picked up this album at 10:00 AM the day it was released and I had already listened to it like 5 times by 1:00 PM.  Just like the other albums, it's very addictive and will leave you wanting more after you're done listening.  Buy it, you won't regret it, dance with Eddie all you want ... Up the Irons!!!!
B000002MNL|5.0|&gt;&gt;at first I've gotta admit that I was a bit skeptikal about morrissey being able to keep what he had w/ the smiths: the ability to write such good lyrics. Vauxhall and I is no exception, lyrically it's amazing, I mean &quot;the more you ignore me the close i get you're wasting your time&quot; says it all!...it shows morrissey's talent of being able to express himself in such a way that has never been done in the past. Speedway, The More You Ignore Me The Closer I get, Why Dont you Find out For yourself?, Now my heart is full are stand out tracks!, if youre a true morrissey fan, or just getting into the music, Vauxhall and I is a sure way of making you a true fan. You know what? words cant describe how good this albulm is...honestly!, so take my word and get this albulm!.you wont regret anything!!!...VIVA MORRISSEY!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Arguably the best maiden album(dare i say it?) since powerslave. This album is really amazing. Tracks 3 to 8 seem to stand out the best. The first two songs are kinda weak but after that it just rocks. The guitar structures are similar to the number of the beast(hallowed be thy name) on a few tracks. This is a brilliant album that must be listened to more than once to realize its power. One cut(new frontier) even reminds me of the first two albums. In my opinion the best songs are montsegur, dance of death, gates of tomorrow, paschendale, no more lies, and the jorneyman. The title track just might be the best epic song they have done since rime of the ancient mariner.
B00005JLK0|2.0|ok, here it goes. You got the crew (Gabriel Bryne, Ron Eldard, Karl Urban, Isiah Washington and Juliana Marguiles), on a voyage to make money on a lost ship, found by (Desmond Harrington). They get in and something starts to happen. They see things, and hear things. Could the ship be alive!(I wonder, Hmmm). Then you get no scares whatsoever, just a really great death rate movie where people get cut in half by extention wires, and gunned down, hanged and stabbed threw the face with a hook. Then theres this big plot twist, The guy who found it and brought them to the ship(Harrington) is actually a ghost and hes harvesting bodys for the ship. Can anyone survive this ordeal, YES, Margulies does and she thinks its over but then, a end that was so gay, bringing Harrington back and him inhabiting another ship. What a waste of my time. Thank's Zack for letting me see this sappy horror movie.
B00003CWOL|3.0|would have really liked this movie if it wasn't so full of politically correct B.S. like the muse says you only have to have a religion, not be christian or jay and bob say abortion is alright. not many extras.
B000094J5W|3.0|I saw Old School in the theaters and let me tell ya, whew. It had its moments, basically Vince Vaughn and Will Ferrell steal the movie and Jeremy Piven is just so hateable in this movie. The funniest moments are when Ferrell and that old guy are together, Blue. <br />Funniest line- &quot;Your my boy Blue&quot;- Ferrell<br />anyway, I enjoyed it for its time and I left not so bored.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|Though this movie was not as good as the first,this is definately a thinking \\"man\\" movie.If you wanted more special effects,I advise you wait for \\"Spider-Man II\\" in 2004.<BR>If you want a movie that will engage your brain cells than \\"The Matrix:Reloaded\\" is the movie for you.Despite a few special effects that were new,none of them was breath taking except the freeway scene.Once again this movie is more about philosophy and \\"waking up\\",choosing the right direction that is not a selfish one,but Neo followed his heart instead of what was right.
0385504209|3.0|The story contained within the book is a thriller. The one problem I encountered though, was the non-existence of Robert Langdon at the Harvard University website. The author alleges that Robert Langdon, the protangonist, is a professor at Harvard. This leads me to believe that the book, albeit interesting, is one big falsehood.

B0000AI44Q|5.0|This is some of Young's greatest work, period. I can listen to it over and over again and not get tired of it.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|What can you say about a film set at a college named after a pencil? <br />Animal House was the first and, to me, the best of the National Lampoon comedies. It was outragiously funny and even daring for its time (the Nixonian Watergate years). It also was the prototype of the many slapstick college/youth films that followed and tried to make the same mark, but John Landis and his merry men had already spray-painted the wall. It also made its young cast of unknowns into famous names: John Belushi (still missed), Tim Matheson, Peter Reigert, Karen Allen, Kevin Bacon, et all. <br />My grown kids can't get over how this movie can turn their sober middle-aged parents into carbon copies of them, or why the words &quot;food fight&quot;, &quot;double secret probation&quot;, &quot;road trip&quot; and &quot;Toga! Toga!&quot; make us smile and giggle at each other. They're at that age when they can't imagine their parents having been their age. However, they recently watched the film on DVD with us, and I think they understand a little better now. (&quot;Hey, that's Keifer Sutherland's dad. Cool!&quot;) Its early 60's setting was our youth, right on the cusp of the youth explosion, the Beatles, civil rights and peace marches, and Vietnam. Every generation is entitled to enjoy its youth, each in its own way, until maturity intrudes.<br />The new two-disc anniverary release has features that are worth the money for AH fans. The image clarity and sound definition are improved over the original DVD; the new &quot;mockumentary&quot; about the current lives of the Faberians is an improv hoot---they obviously had a good time making it; the anecdotal pop-ups that can be made to appear throughout the film are both funny and informational; and the newly expanded documentary about the making of the film gives a greater appreciation of the hurdles the filmmakers had to clear to get it made.<br />So get with your frat brothers and sorority sisters, dress in your finest bedsheets, pop somebrewskis (and keep some green jello handy), and take a road trip with Bluto, Hoover, Otter, Boone, Pinto, Flounder, D-Day and the rest of the Deltans to Animal House. Otherwise, Dean Wormer will put us all on Double Secret Probation!
B00008PW3Q|3.0|Besides the Lindsay-less &quot;Behind the Mask&quot; bomb in the early 90's, this has must be the quickest fall from the charts in the big mac's history.  Not that this is any guage for quality, as we are now inundated with overcrafted candy from Christing, Justin, and Beyonce.  I give Lindsay credit for taking some chances and being more cutting-edge than most musicians from the 70's (i.e. the Eagles and their never ending safety-net of sounds).  However, as with most cutting edge material, it's basically form over function,<BR>or studio-driven self-indulgence that leaves the listener out of the conversation.    What he still does he does very well, and that is taking Stevie Nicks' usual F/G/Am progression (in different keys but always in there) and making it sound a little more fresh.  Take &quot;Thrown Down&quot;, which is classic Stevie, same chords as 'Dreams' with a 'Gypsy' like laddering of lead guitar, yet it sounds good because of Lindsay's crisp production.  As a big Stevie fan, however, I think that only she can somehow cheapen 9/11 with her sometimes overly self-important poetry (read her diary entries on her website...cringeworthy) on &quot;Illume&quot;.  Also, some of her other songs are throwaways that were obviously album rejects given to Lindsay because she didn't have anything new to offer.  Even &quot;Running Through the Garden&quot; sounds like a reject from &quot;rock a little&quot; and I think the synthesizers are taken from that 80's period.  It is a good song but the words are silly psychobabble.  The redeeming point here is &quot;Goodbye Baby&quot; which is a song she wrote in the 70's.  I do believe that &quot;Peacekeeper&quot; is a fantastic song and shows the two of them at their best.  I cannot believe that it did not become a huge hit.  I don't think that &quot;Say You Will&quot; will become a hit, because it is way too basic and monotone.  Perhaps it will be a hit on the AC chart.<br />In conclusion, I was eagerly anticipating this album because I was never a fan of Christine McVie's.   Her songs always sent me on bathroom breaks at home and to the concession stand at a concert.   However, given that, I was dissapointed in what has been offered overall, especially after years of nothing.
B00009W0WM|5.0|What can I say about Casablanca that's new? Nothing. My words would only repeat the millions already written or spoken about this classic film, so I'll spare you. Only the film remains new, fresh and exciting with every viewing.<br />The two-disc DVD release is a must for Casablanca fans. In my opinion, the special features most worth having on it are the two separate film commentaries by Roger Ebert and Rudy Behlmer, interesting and informative without being academic; the sparkling Screen Guild Players radio play starring Bogart, Bergman and Henreid, which has been digitally cleaned and enhanced; the hilarious homage cartoon Carrotblanca; and the filmed comments of the stars' children, Pia Lindstrom and Steven Bogart, about their parents' collaboration on the film.<br />Get Casablanca. This could be the beginning of a beautiful friendship for you with the film, or the renewal of an old and unforgettable love. Either way, you'll be delighted that you'll always have Paris.
B000002GFT|5.0|I have always viewed Fairport Convention as kind of like the UK version of the Byrds, simply for the fact that both bands had outstanding musicians, several amazing songwriters, came up with stellar arrangements, and did wonderful folk as well as Dylan interpretations. I also think that both bands just radiate complete and total honesty in their music, almost to the point of being spiritual in a way. While at one point The Byrds went full-tilt country with &quot;Sweethearts of the Rodeo&quot;, Fairport Convention went all-out folk-rock with this album. Both albums had stunning results, and both albums started an entire music genre. If you have ever been curious as to what UK folk rock is about, then start here! This album is simply the very best of its kind! Five stars in every way!
B00007LTIG|3.0|It's odd that the Dead's first album sounds completely different than anything else they would do for the next 30+ years.  Oddity, however, would be in keeping with one's expectations for this band.  Although the '89 CD release of this album was simply terrible, at least the sound on the re-release is considerably improved.  Still, the performances here are restrained, albeit slightly schizoid; the production tinny; and the concept going nowhere very quickly.  The Dead were never able to say anything effectively quickly, and that is the problem with this album.  Recorded in a matter of days, and under the influence of prescription speed, the Dead at this point sound more like a hyperkinetic day-glo-go-go kitten than the sprawling lysergic beast that would later prowl the concerthalls and stadiums of an aging, decidedly non-Aquarian America.  That said, the album does offer a charming timepiece quality.  The Hashbury jumper, &quot;Golden Road&quot; sounds like a band with a sunny future.  &quot;Cold Rain and Snow&quot; and &quot;Minglewood Blues&quot; went on to become concert staples for four more decades.  &quot;Viola Lee Blues&quot; is clearly the high point of the album, pun very much intended.  Listen to the bonus live version of &quot;Viola&quot;;  at one point during the meltdown, one could swear they are listening to Sonic Youth (who were called, by at least one critic, the 'Dead of the nineties').  Noise is bliss.
B00004WG2X|5.0|I watched this version of Pride and Prejudice just after completing the novel.  I loved the book; I HATED THE MOVIE!  Hoping for better luck, I watched the A&amp;E version and fell instantly in love with it.  The A&amp;E may be longer, but it is well worth the time, especially when compared to this one.
B000001FZK|3.0|In a way this is a sad follow up to \\"Spirit of Eden.\\" \\"Laughing Stock\\" is not bad per se, but for a band that on each new release dragged pop music further a field and injected much needed intelligence, this album feels like warmed up left overs. IT offers nothing new from \\"Spirit of Eden\\" and in many ways is less engaging, less well thought out and clearly not the band at the top of its game. I was crushed when it became clear the band had split for good after this was released, but really, what more could they do?<br />Get this to make your collection complete, but by all means do not start here. I suggest \\"Spirit of Eden\\" and then \\"Natural History.\\" Between those two, if you give them time to grow on you, you will end up buying everything the band has done anyway!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|What can I say.. I bought the CD 4 days prior to the official release and it's never left my CD player since!<BR>When I hear this album I think '..now Maiden have really come back in full force, like in the good old 80's!'<BR>The vast majority of Maiden albums usually have 1 epic, 2 at tops, but Dance of Death reaches about 4 easily!!<BR>Buy this album and enjoy bliss with tracks like Paschendale, No More Lies, Montsegur or Dance of Death! The 3 guitars are much better than in Brave New World and everything honestly sounds like this band is constantly renewing it's blood suply!<BR>What a GREAT band and what a GREAT album! Dance the Dance of Death!!
B000002J1U|4.0|\\"Led Zeppelin III\\" finds Jimmy Page, Robert Plant, John Paul Jones & John Bonham mixing softer, folkier songs with their trademark hard rock stuff. Some fans loved the acoustic/electric mix, while others were put off. Personally, I think the blend works great. \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" may not be the band's crowning achievement, but nonetheless this is an excellent album. The band shred wallpaper on thunderous tracks like \\"The Immigrant Song,\\" \\"Celebration Day,\\" and \\"Out On The Tiles,\\" while \\"Since I've Been Loving You\\" is a long, slinky, tasty blues rocker. Zeppelin also score with the acoustic stuff, too: \\"Tangerine\\" and \\"That's The Way\\" are both gorgeous songs, \\"Friends\\" & \\"Gallows Pole\\" are also strong numbers, \\"Bron-Y-Aur Stomp\\" is great fun, and the grand finale, \\"Hats Off To (Roy) Harper,\\" featuring just Page's steel string guitarfest on one speaker & Plant's distorted, warbly vocals on the other, is weird but very compelling. \\"Led Zeppelin III\\" is a great Zep disc, showcasing the band's magic touch with the acoustic as well as the electric. Highly recommended.
055357342X|5.0|Well, I finally get around to reviewing one of Martin's books! My fiance and I have been reading them rabidly ever since he picked up the first book in the series,  A Game of Thrones, earlier in the summer. We've both agreed that although he isn't deep as far as insightful material into humanity, Martin is fast-paced, fun, and reads like a medieval tale at times, with a healthy dose of good descriptions, fierce battles, and lots of politics. The characters are likeable, although at times his love of the loner bites through them, every one. I don't want to spoil the story, as surprises are what Martin is good at. Just know that he often subscribes to the idea that nice guys finish last.    For those who know Martin only as a sci-fi writer, be prepared! Although he approaches this tale with the same kind of blunt humanity and technical preparation that goes into such novels, there is also some of the fantastic about the realm, as is proper in this genre. For those who are used to the typical fantasy novel, beware! There is far more sex and language and less magic than in the kinds of books you're used to.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|When Bruce and Adrian got back, I was excited but still sceptical on whether its gonna work in recreating the magic. The release of Brave New World made it seem like Maiden was dead since I found it to be uninsipiring, bland, and with excessively repetitive choruses. But I'm pleasantly surprised that Dance of Death is so good and fresh sounding. There aren't any of the drawbacks on this that I found on its predecessor, and Adrian has more songs to his credit which really help. However I feel the opening track &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; doesn't belong on this album as its average at best but then the rest of the songs are kickass and so I don't mind. By the way, whoever did the album cover should be shot dead!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron maiden has released their new album Dance of Death, and once again they gave music what deserves a 5 star in my black book. This is a more open Iron Maiden, with long rich songs, incredible gitar playing and a spectacular voice of Bruce Dickinson. From start to finish this no doubt is one of Iron Maiden best albums to date. Title track Dance to death sure chills your bones, one of my favourites on the album, together with paschendale and face in the sand. But really this album has no low downs. Hearing the single wildest dreams a time ago, I thought that this would be a short album, with short content, but now with the album in my hands, Really this is really a long and awaiting masterpiece. Most song are 6 to 8 minuttes long, and really it can`t go wrong with these masters of Iron Maiden. Being a fan as myself, I can hear that Iron Maiden has given the soul in to this album. Iron makes and album that takes something from all their earlier releases, not meaning thats bad, and makes 11 beautifull songs in the way that only Iron Maiden can do it.<BR>And yes what is so bad about the cover? Nothing really. I liked the artwork, and if someone dares to give it a star less because of this, then they sure can`t be true fans. Up the Irons.
1858286999|4.0|As it's names suggests, this book is a good comprehensive and readable rough guide to Japan. However, if you want a more in-depth source of info you'd be better off contacting the Japanese Tourist Office and asking them to send you pamphlets and maps. There are places which are not covered by this book and many rural places are mentioned only in passing. There are sections where the authors have clearly visited and remembered enough to write down directional guides, but on the whole, I'd say that the book provides an overview of what's on offer. Overall, I'd recommend it to someone who has never visited Japan, but to get the most out of your holiday, I'd use this as starter reference only. My only gripe is that there aren't enough pictures and you don't get a feel for the places.

0060090383|5.0|Rachel's Holiday, by Marian Keyes, explores the life of a 27 year old young Irish lady, \\"Rachel Walsh\\" and what happens when she is checked into the \\"Betty Ford clinic of Ireland\\": The Cloisters.  Famous people were known to go there.  And besides, even though she loved doing cocaine, drinking alcohol, taking pills, and having sex with almost any guy who wanted her.Rachel thought a break from NYC would be good for her.  And besides, her boyfriend, \\"Luke\\" had just broken her heart.  <br />She muses:<BR>\\"A rehabilitation place seemes like a good idea.  A great idea...I'd read about the Cloisters and it sounded wonderful.  I had visions of spending a lot of time sitting around wraped in a big towel.  Of steam rooms, saunas, massage, seaweed treatment, algae, that kind of thing.\\"<BR>Rachel also believes that \\"maybe for people like me [her]...ones that didn't have serious problems would be allowed out in the evenings to walk down to the local pub.\\"<br />We learn a new definition of what a serious problem could be.  <BR>Rachel is shocked when she finds out that she herself is very much mistaken, and that an addict is an addict.  Though she goes into a  program and stays there initially feeling a hatred of the Cloisters, Rachel learns a lot about addiction, where it stems from, why it happens, and what we (she) can do about it.  <br />The novel was very touching and also funny - I laughed out loud in certain parts and then the parts that brought tears to my eyes.    <BR>I could relate becaue I am also 27 and see many Rachel Walshes in real life.  This is a lesson for them.  <br />Rachel gains new viewpoints on who she is and what she is (and is not) capable of doing in the real world during her \\"holiday\\" and her attempts to apply her newfound skills to her real life.  This is a story of growth, realization, acceptance and determination, and most of all that we all struggle to maintain \\"normalcy\\" in the face of adversity.

B000003TAR|5.0|Sadly this is Nirvana's last studio album. Imagine if other great bands like the Beattles, Doors, Led Zeppelin, Ramones, U2, or Pearl Jam only had 2 major albums and you realize what a true loss losing Kurt was for all of us. Enough speculation on what might have been, instead let us celebrate what we do have. In Utero is simply a great album. I love the raw emotions from the over the top aggression to the soft melodies.  This album truly has it all. Nirvana is my favorite band. Kurt's words and the bands music spoke to me like no other band has been able to do. If you have Nevermind or Unplugged than you will like this album.<br />1. Serve the Servants. 9/10 Gets the album off to a great start. Good Guitars and drums good lyrics about fame and his father.<br />2. Scentless Apprentice. 10/10 A hard driving drumbeat starts this off then the pounding guitars open up. Kurt's screams are amazing as is this song.<br />3. Heart Shaped Box. 10/10 One of the best songs ever. Starts off with soft melodic guitars before your speakers get blown out.<br />4. Rape Me. 9/10 An amazing antirape song.<br />5. Frances Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle. 8/10 The weakest song on the album but it still is a really good song. The chrous of &quot;I miss the comfort in being sad&quot; is extra heart wrenching in light of Kurt's death.<br />6. Dumb. 9/10 Soft, acoustic song with often funny lyrics. Good change of pace from the other harder faster songs before it.<br />7. Very Ape. 9/10 The only problem with this one is it is too short.<br />8. Milk It. 10/10 I love the drum sound and the song breaks.<br />9. Penny Royal Tea. 10/10 This is often my favorite Nirvana song (it rotates). The quiet verses once again are complemented by loud choruses. The Guitar solo is awesome.<br />10. Radio Friendly Music Shifter. 10/10 At first I didn't like this song because of its abrassive use of feedback. After a few listens I realized how original and great this song is.<br />11. Tourettes. 8/10 Really good short punk raver.<br />12. All Apologies. 10/10 Another great song and fan favorite.<br />Nirvana changed the world and certainly changed me. I hope you get this album (and all their others) and let them change you.
0385504209|5.0|I cannot sufficiently describe how fascinating I found this book. I bought it because I enjoy a good mystery, but it is so much more!  Not only is it a fast-paced novel of suspense full of twists and turns, but it is also packed full of fascinating facts about history, art, science, and religion.  Nearly every time I turned a page, I discovered a new fact that made my jaw drop.  Given how surprised I was by a lot of the information in the book, I did a bit of superficial research on the web and discovered that his facts and theories are well-supported by many others, as well.  I dare say I learned more interesting information from reading this novel than in any science, history, or art class I took in college ... and definitely more than I ever learned from my church.<br />Never before has a work of fiction sparked an academic curiosity in me until &quot;The Da Vinci Code.&quot;  As a result of reading this book, I bought several resources regarding the religious history and theories researched by Dan Brown -- something I never thought I would be interested in -- and I can't wait to learn more.  I have also shared this book with every member of my family, who all also loved it, including my father, who generally only reads non-fiction.<br />If you buy only one book this year, make it this one!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|The great maiden we know are back,and let me just state my first point that it infinity times better than Metallica's St.Anger album-proving that Maiden really are the best heavy metal band on this planet today.Those who think that metallica are the best can shut up because this years events have proved them wrong.Okey,Metallica may have been good in the 80s but then they started to turn commercial but the thing about Maiden is theyll stick to their unique style throughout which is why i give them so much more respect.<br />Onto the album itself-i prefere this work to brave new world and thats saying something as it was a difficult predeccesor to beat.Every track on this album is good-the catchy single 'wildest dreams' and 'rainmaker'(which would make another good single) are good openers.We then get onto possibly the best work on the album'no more lies'which is a classic maiden song-let me state that the guitar solo is incredible.<br />The other best tracks are the title track which has a really goog medievil feel to it and 'paschendale'. I should name the others as they are also superb-some may find the 'journeyman' a bit tame but i personally like it. THIS IS A MUST ALBUM FOR A METAL FAN-you wont regret it!
B00005YW4H|5.0|Mellow, relaxing, dreamy, soothing, sensual, effortless ... it's like an album full of adult lullabyes with the added dimension of a sultry, somewhat mysterious voice.<br />If you're looking for something energetic or loud or violent or danceable, this isn't it.  But, no matter what your age, if you enjoy unique talent and music to soothe your soul, you can buy this album with confidence.  I have a feeling I will still be listening to her timeless music many years from now, which is most likely not the case with the majority of the CDs I own.  I can't wait to see what she does with her next album.
B00006JJ1O|3.0|The CD Starts Off Awesome... Then Slowly Descends Into Romantic Music About Their Love And How They Get In Fights... Then It Goes Up Again... The 2 First And Last 4 Are Great Songs... I'm Not Into That Lovey Stuff When It Comes To Pop Or Russian Techno... So It Seems Kind Of Out Of Place
B00007BK2N|1.0|great story, and an important tale to tell, unfortunatley the movie does not live up to expectations.  Its just a bad movie:  hard to follow, hard to hear (audio is soft), a lot of the story gets lost and muddled along the way, and another downside,  Steve Coogan in the starring role.  Thumbs down.  Read the book instead.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|If you are an Iron Maiden Fan, you will ove this CD. True Maiden style! On this CD they bring back the old style Maiden embeded with their new style! Cant wait to see them live! Up The Irons!!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I was a bit worried, with some of the stuff I heard about this album, before it's release, but man....I WAS BLOWN AWAY!!<BR>Forget anything you have heard and buy this album, the worst track on it, was Wildest Dreams (the radio played single) with the best being, in my opinion the title track &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Face in the sand&quot;. Dance of death sounds like a cross between older songs, like Phantom of the Opera and Fear of the Dark.<BR>The album is a bit more progressive than Iron Maiden have done in the past, so some people may be a bit surprised and it's alot to take in, in one listen.<BR>Most of the songs are over 6 minutes (3 of them over 8), with 11 tracks, you're getting your money's worth out of it.<BR>It's also amazing how far Adrian, Dave and even Janick have come in their guitar playing too. The solos are fast and sound very well thought out.<BR>Overall, I give this album a 9/10, it blows away their last one (&quot;Brave New World&quot;) and will stand along with alot of the classics.
B00008MLSH|5.0|Anna Netrebko has everything to be a truly exceptional artist. This is a fabulous debut.
B00005JLRT|2.0|Following in the footsteps of recent Star Trek film DVD releases, Nemesis is packed with features (albeit on a single disc). For first time viewers I would advise watching the film before watching any of the featurettes, at least one contains major spoilers. In themselves the featurettes are interesting to watch but they don't add to the experience in any way. The deleted scenes are a mixed bag, some should have been retained in the film: Picard and Data after the wedding ceremony; Picard speaking to Beverly in sickbay; and Deanna in the turbolift. The \\"original\\" ending is awful and I'm grateful it ended up on the cutting room floor. <br />The picture quality is excellent, especially since a lot of the film features near-dark sets. The sound quality is very good. In all, an excellent transfer to DVD.<br />As to the film itself... The Next Generation is my favourite of the Star Trek shows (the original comes second). I was hooked from Encounter at Farpoint and have enjoyed all 7 seasons and the subsequent films. When I first heard about Nemesis I eagerly awaited this film - Romulans, a Khan-like foe for Picard, a script from one of the writers of Gladiator - wow!<br />It's the first of any of the films that really disappointed me when I saw it at the cinema. Nothing has changed now that I have seen it again on DVD. No matter what anyone else says, Nemesis does indeed rip off The Wrath of Khan - Shinzon is a product of genetic engineering, he has a powerful weapon in his possession that is deployed to devastating effect at the film's climax. <br />Sure, Patrick Stewart gets some wonderful moments in the film, but that's about it. The introduction of B4 serves little purpose other than to give Brent Spiner a new character. Troi's mental rape serves no purpose other than to act as a means by which Picard can finally strike back at Shinzon. The other members of the cast do get a look in but its almost as if they are playing different characters, never mind their shockingunderuse. The fight between Riker and the Viceroy might have worked better and made more sense if it had been between Worf and the Viceroy.<br />Much as I want to see Star Trek 11 and for the series to continue, I am saddened that TNG has ended with a whimper. For me, Nemesis ranks tenth. <br /> 1st Star Trek First Contact (91%)<BR>2nd Star Trek IV: The Voyage Home (90%)<BR>3rd Star Trek II: The Wrath of Khan (89%)<BR>4th Star Trek Generations (84%)<BR>5th Star Trek VI: The Undiscovered Country (83%)<BR>6th Star Trek III: The Search for Spock (79%)<BR>7th Star Trek the Motion Picture (78%)<BR>8th Star Trek V: The Final Frontier (74%)<BR>9th Star Trek Insurrection (71%)<BR>10th Star Trek Nemesis (70%)
B00005JLXE|4.0|Daredevil, as a movie, is a solid comic book movie.  I have no idea how it relates to the comic books, but this movie is solid.  Ben Affleck give a better-than-expected performance as Murdock/Daredevil, and Jennifer Garner does a solid job as well.  There are a few plot holes, but the movie is worthwhile.<br />On the technical aspect, DVD's don't get much better than this.  The picture quality is perfect and the Dolby Digital 5.1 track is outstanding.  Definitely a good one to show off.  There are also plenty of extras on the DVD to watch.  Pick up this DVD if you are a fan of superhero movies.
B0000AI44Q|5.0|I agree with several other reviewers in that this Neil Young collection of songs is a &quot;classic&quot;, especially after repeated listenings. It appears Mr.Young has decided to ground this music in the blues and it works marvelously. The repetitive tone of the songs sets the stage for the lyrics and the stories they tell. This CD is actually a novella put to music. I have seen this production on tour recently and it was one of the most magnificent musical &quot;experiences&quot; I have encountered in a long time. Mr. Young's songs are filled with the passions of youth, the torment of tortured souls, and the good feelings of basic day to day life. Mr. Young has reminded me, after all these years, to have faith and still dream. His Greendale CD reflects these ideas. Unfortunately, there are too many people out there who would rather Mr. Young re-hash some of his most popular work, but he continues to evolve artistically after more than 3 decades in the business. Hats off to Neil Young on this effort!
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity is a solid movie.  It uses flashbacks to tell the beginning of the story, sort of rewinding it so you see why things are the way they are.  The movie doesn't give away much and there is a twist at the end that doesn't cheat to get there.<br />Solid performances from Ray Liotta, John Cusack, and especially Amanda Peet.  If the previews interested you, pick up this DVD.  It is worth it.
B00008S2VG|3.0|American Life by Madonna's examples how can you over use a formula already wasted by her!, working again with electronic Mirwais, made Madonna sound the same as always with nothin' new to apport to music, oddly for her!, I think she needs sometime back in the States!. Altough this has some killer tracks that got lost in fillers and totally boring songs.<br />American Life: 5/5 I think this song is unfairly judge, I believe is one of the best tracks, I don't understand why the rap?, but ultimately u will end up liking it!<br />Hollywood: 5/5 I love the message, so real, I really feel dispate the electronic beats, this sounds like early Madonna!<br />I'm So Stupid: 1/5 Don't like her voice here, lyrics kind of silly. Rhythm ok.<br />Love Profusion: 2/5 Lyrics are the strong here, but the music drives to boriness.<br />Nobody knows Me: 5/5 Great Beats, One of the favorite Cut.<br />Nothing Fails: 5/5 One of greatest cuts of the album. Message on belief in life and great soul.<br />Intervention: 1/5 Filler. Talks about the strong feeling of love, boring guitar string sounds over and over again! very boring!<br />X-tatic Process: 1/5 Old Jewel alike song, not great move for her.  She keeps talking about religion, and finding herself.<br />Mother And Father:5/5 The beats are great, the lyrics are strange?, but enough to keep you listen to it. Another lapsus Rap moment for Madonna. Talks about her family history already known by all her fans. Sounds like the record is damage. Fun to listen to.<br />Die Another Day: 5/5 I Love the lyrics, and the rhythm, sadly I feel like this song doesn't fit, maybe they include it, because they listen to the boring cuts already recorded for this album.<BR>Great Idea The Laugh of Madonna on the song! Love It!<br />Easy Ride: 1/5 ¿What?, sooooooo boring....enough said!<br />Madonna go back to the studio quick and kiss AI Paula Abdul and Ozzy.
B00006JDVV|5.0|Some movies cause you to question their logic, others you just accept it.  I just accepted it for Reign of Fire, and it caused me to really enjoy the movie.  The computer graphics were better than expected, and if you have a Dolby Digital 5.1 surround sound system, crank it up...it's awesome.  Great performances by the leads, especially Christian Bale, mixed with good special effects makes this a worthwhile film.  The DVD has some nice extras, too, making it worth the purchase.
B00005JKPF|4.0|This movie has more action, more character development, and better special effects than the first.  However, that's about it.  Bryan Singer does a very good job in attempting to keep the audience into the movie. And for the first hour he does a very good job.  However at two hours and fifteen minutes, it gets boring after a while.  The movie starts off great but ends fair.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|I like several million others out there awaited with bated breath the arrival of the new Fleetwood Mac album...and it arrived...however, it doesn't sound as much of a Fleetwood Mac album as a Buckingham/Nicks Mark II album.  This is no criticism: it's just that without Christine McVie, the songs seem to have changed a little, veering away from her style and pop sensibilities that drove the bands' chart hits for so many years.  But this album is, unquestionably, fantastic.  Amazingly layered tracks like Murrow and Red Rover are simply stunning: Buckingham's guitar playing is technically and creatively at some kind of zenith.  Two Stevie tracks stand out in my mind: Running Through the Garden and Everybody Finds Out, which showcase the Queen of the Mac at her siren-like best.  It also features Bleed To Love Her which was a highlight of 1996's The Dance.  It's a fairly long album (never a bad thing in my opinion - remember Tusk, the criminally underrated Mac album of 1979?), but absolutely worth a listen for the casual fan and a must-have for nuts like me who think Stevie and Lindsey should still run off and get married.  Great stuff from the legends...let's hope they keep going and going.
B00005JM09|5.0|With all the movies that I'd seen this summer, this one ranks right up there at the top.  I thought this movie was better than the first two Terminator movies, especially the script.  This movie had more funny dialogue than the first two movies.  Plus there is a car chase scene in this movie that is very well done (I thought it was just as good as the one in Bad Boys II).  Also you rarely see a fight scene taking place in a restroom.  This is one of those few action packed movies that will keep you awake and adrenaline pumped from the beginning to the end.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I was crushed when FOX in their infinite wisdom cancelled the show.  I am anxiously awaiting the release of the FIREFLY DVD which I understand includes 3 unseen episodes.  This series is fresh and fun with a great ensemble of characters and I can't wait to receive the DVD.  FOX has no loyalty to the shows they air or to their fans.  Take my advice...if you like a show on FOX...tape it.  It will soon be gone.  FIREFLY...we still love you.
B00005KHJR|5.0|The Wicker Man is a classic of Seventies British Cinema.  While it is perhaps best viewed as a mystery/thriller, there are enough horrific moments, including the much-vaunted ending, to warrant it's inclusion in any good horror collection.  The horror in this case is particularly British in origin, derived not from the \\"shock and gore\\" tactics of the American slasher flicks (and people wonder why the American murder statistics are so high), but from a school of psychological thriller more favored by British, Continental and even Japanese audiences to a certain extent - witness the original \\"Ring\\" versus the American re-make.  The psychological thrills and chills here come from the sheer weirdness of Summerisle; the entire concept that a small section of Britain could've remained untouched by the norms of \\"civilized Christian society\\".  Remember, this is 1970's Britain we're talking about here - many aspects of life on the island would have been deeply shocking to the general viewing public.  The audience at the time I suspect would've felt more strongly motivated to identify with Woodward's police officer than we do now (lack of respect for authority figures hadn't quite taken off to the same extent we feel it now) and he represents onscreen the shock the audience would've felt too - No Church?! Paganism being taught as a religion in School!?!  Public nudity!?!  Perhaps most shocking of all is the explicit encouragement of the plummy, public school Lord of the Manor (played fantastically by Lee).  What is the world coming too if the upper classes are complicit in this depravity!?<br />The movie is so much more than an extended set-up for the climax.  Deep religious themes are explored, although perhaps again they would be more familiar to a British viewer in the 70's than an American viewer now.  One cannot help but notice the similarities between the Christianity that Woodward represents and the pagan rituals of the islanders, and we are drawn to Woodward's blindness to the similarities, even as he read them out to us.  The film is incredibly atmospheric.  The juxtaposition of everyday small town life portrayed on the island with the incredible isolation and impenetrability of the community is particularly chilling.  Their lack of respect for the authority represented by the police. Their recent fall from prosperity.  These themes would also have struck a chord with Brits in the mid-70s as the country fell into recession, a 3-day working week was introduced, and a country still feeling the economic aftershocks of WW2 was faced with out of control inflation and soaring unemployment.  The collapse of civilization was a topic close to everyone's heart, and to have the undercurrents of anarchy so deeply entwined with this movie would have resonated on a deep psychological level.  The creepy music also helps create a strange atmosphere - all haunting folk songs and bizarre melodies with nary a Jimmy Page solo in sight would have sounded as foreign in the 70s as it does now.<br />This movie still holds a cult (or occult...) charm over the British psyche even today.  The Mock Turtles not only have a song called \\"The Wicker Man\\", they also recorded a note perfect cover version of the haunting \\"Willow song\\" from the movie's soundtrack for their 1990 album \\"Turtle Soup\\".  Pulp had a song on their 2003 \\"We Love Life\\" album called \\"Wickerman\\".  Up and coming British band, The Coral brilliantly recreated large parts of the movie for the video to their 2002 hit \\"Goodbye\\".  Comedy group \\"The League of Gentlemen\\" were quoted as saying \\"Everything we do is ripped-off \\"The Wicker Man\\", and it would be hard to believe that the Monty Python boys never saw it before making \\"The Holy Grail\\".  It is interesting therefore to question why American viewers are less likely to become addicted to the movie.  Perhaps the slow pacing, religious themes and British quirkiness are too much for some people. Perhaps Americans have no concept of what life was like in 70s Britain.  I was amused for example, by the reviewer who suggested the movie was unrealistic because \\"also, the officer arrives without a weapon and then neglects to arm himself during the entire length of the film despite repeated instances of insubordination. an officer who is anticipating a confrontation with a large mob would arm himself...you cannot deny that\\".  Given that to this day British police officers are armed only with a baton and their razor sharp wit, I find it somewhat anachronistic to suggest that Edward Woodward should have arrived \\"packing heat\\".  Also, remember, (and those who haven't seen the movie should skip a sentence) when he does attempt to return to the mainland for reinforcements, he finds his plane has been sabotaged.<br />Other issues raised include the personal dilemma that threatens to rip Woodward apart - is he primarily a Christian or a Policeman?  I find it hard to see how anyone could find this movie offensive, as the treatments of a personal faith in Jesus and a belief in the goodness of mother nature both get a good hearing, and a more rounded treatment than you'd expect from a film.  And I don't think that Britt Ekland's breasts are offensive in anyway, the nudity is essential to the film to show the \\"loose moral character\\" of the islanders, and to demonstrate how uptight Woodward is.<br />On a different note, the \\"extra minutes\\" included on the DVD are somewhat un-necessary.  They look like someone found them behind a radiator 30 years later, there's been no attempt made to make them fit in and they add pretty much nothing to the plot of the film. Still, it's probably good to watch that version once for completeness' sake.  I'd imagine though when you have friends round to watch it (as you inevitably will, this being a movie that you instantly want everyone you know to see) you'll want to show them the regular version, so you won't have to keep apologizing for the terrible image quality every 15 minutes.in 70s Britain.

B0000AKCLS|5.0|It doesn't happen too often to me to be fascinated and carried away by a new CD at the first listening. Well, it has happened this time! What a master this guy is! And what a milestone in the history of modern blues this CD is already! After two solid blues-rock releases Joe turns straight into the blues and the final result is so amazing that the first reaction a common human being could only have after have been listening to it, it is about half an hour of silence simply because this CD leaves you speechless!<br />I quite like Joe's first two efforts, however from my point of view this one is much, much better than the previous two. Joe demonstrates beyond any doubts that he is at this moment in time maybe the best guitar player, or in the worst case scenario one of the three bests, alive. It is absolutely pointless to try to work out which one is the best cut on this album, all the 12 \\"12 bars\\" songs here are equally good. Joe is able to cover all the spectrum of the blues reinterpreting (be aware not covering) B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Albert Collins, John Lee Hooker and even Robert Johnson with such a great taste and personality that you will not believe to your own ears! He plays slide and acoustic with the same intensity and feeling he usually plays traditional electric guitar and his playing in the three slow blues included here is so wonderful that you can't avoid having shivers going up and down your spine. In my personal opinion this is by far the best electric, guitar driven blues album of at least the last twenty years. I would be really surprised and flabbergasted if he will not have the W.C. Handy Blues Award as best guitarist when time will come. More than highly recommended I would say that Blues Deluxe is simply an essential addition to everyone collection. Much more than 5 stars!<br /><br />PS. I have been lucky enough to have the chance to see Joe playing live on the 22nd of May 2005 in a small club in north London. He played a lot of songs from Blues Deluxe and the live version of the title track was just mind blowing! I am old enough to have seen live on stage such greats like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Albert King, Albert Collins, B.B. King, Buddy Guy, Luther Allison, Luther \\"Guitar Junior\\" Johnson, Little Milton, Johnny Winter, Ronnie Earl, Hubert Sumlin, Robben Ford, Eric Clapton, Peter Green, Gary Moore, Kid Ramos, Alvin Lee, Mick Taylor and many more...however with all the due respect for such great musicians, Joe is by far the best I've ever seen! Don't miss him live, it will be the greatest experience of your life!the live version of the title track was just mind blowing!

B0000A02TZ|3.0|Everyone, whether you liked the movie or don't find mindless Lampoon humor all that funny, can agree that Animal House gave birth to the college &amp; high school hi-jinx movie genre.<br />Putting my opening statement aside, the movie debuted in 1978, and now being 2003, this would make it the 25th Anniversary.  Usually, when movies hit the fabled 10, 25, 50 year mark, the public thinks of these as classics and when released or re-leased we expect something special of our special editions.<br />Unfortunately, Animal House 'Double Secret Probation' does not deliver in my book.  I'm not going to review the movie, by now everyone should know what it is and you can read other reviews if needed.  However I will review the technical aspects of the movie as well as it's so called extra's.<br />The movie itself, though at times may seem dated in it political correctness or even sophomoric humor still can stand by itself.  However, I think the flagship for National Lampoon would have deserved a clean re-mastering of teh pring and sound.  This didn't seem to be the case.  Overall coloring still seemed no better than my VHS copy as well as sound.  Disappointing to say the least.<br />Then there is the infernal mandatory viewing of 5 minutes or so of various Universal previews you cannot skip.  Annoying feature.<br />There are four extra's, but I only felt only one or two of them warrant any special attention:<br />  1) Alumni update: Approx 15 minutes in length.  Actors are in character all these year later in small 2-3 vignettes each explaining where they are today and what they have been doing.  Some lines are funny, others are not, and sadly some important characters are absent from this update.<br />  2) Shout music video: recent update by some rock group I've never heard of.  Typical movie/music video crossover- band members in some empty warehouse playing a butcheredd version of a song interlaced with movie snippets.  No biggie.<br />  3) Animated trivia.  Re-watch the movie with this feature turned on and gain some trivia..Kinda cool.<br />  4) Making of.  This 45 minute documentary describes how Animal House went from being idea to actual celluloid.  Pretty interesting as this interview segment has many of the main characters, director, composer, screen writer, producers and more talk about the making of the movie along with on-set stories and behind the scenes footage.  Very interesting and the only real extra on this DVD.<br />I would have loved to have seen a few bloopers, and screen tests, especially that of the late John Belushi, and maybe even the location and tour of the Delta house.the movie with this feature turned on and gain some trivia..Kinda cool.<BR>     4) Making of.

B000001EC1|4.0|I think that this is the best album of JBJ's.  I love it!  I am sure that a lot of ppl agree because when of these songs come on in the bar everyone knows the words. The mix if wicked slow songs and fast songs.  Some of my faves are: Always, You Give Love a Bad Name, Bed of Roses, and Bad Medicine.<br />Peace...if you dont got it, then WHY!!??????
B000083E79|4.0|This album truly portrays the vast musical landscape that is called Rock Music. Cher has been able to continually churn hits from whatever element of music is innovative . Starting with the folk rock era of the 1960s ,finishing up with the electronic dance age of the present 21st century, Cher has captured the feel, the excitement and the transformation of her chosen field. <br />I bought this CD for my girlfriend and kept it for myself. I was not a Cher fan before I bought this CD. I now understand her artistry and have to praise her ability to transcend the music to become an icon of popular music. <br />My only knock against this album is that the early Sonny and Cher songs have not been totally remastered. In comparison to the rest of the songs on this set, they seem a little scratchy and very difficult to hear. While many would applaud the use of the complete original, I have always appreciated reediting and mastering of albums to make them better sounding.Just a personal choice, i guess...
B00005V3Z4|4.0|I actually watched this movie on the recommendation of my 15 year old son.  Usually, his tastes are not always the most reliable (!!!), but he was right on the money this time.  This mysterious, funny, moving film has a terrific cast and a very challenging premise.  I won't get into the plot too much (that would be kinda hard to do), but let's just say it messes around a great deal with ideas of time travel.  But it feels like a social satire (a la Heathers) mixed with a moody horror movie (there's a very creep giant rabbit!!).  <br />Jake Gylenhaal, as Donnie, is terrific.  He's been called a &quot;poor man's&quot; Tobey Maquire, but he's every bit Maguire's equal, he just hasn't played Spiderman yet.  He's one of these moody, sensitive, soft-spoken young actors, and those kinds of mannerisms can get a bit tiring, but Jake pulls it off with freshness.  His sister Maggie (who was SO terrific in SECRETARY) plays his sister here, and they have a very believable brother/sister, love/hate relationship.  <br />Patrick Swayze has some fun with his clean image, and the scenes of him as a &quot;motivational speaker&quot; are truly hilarious.  Drew Barrymore plays an understanding school teacher, but, I must confess, she isn't very good.  Noah Wylie has a small part as another teacher, and he's passable.  Frankly, it is the teen cast that makes this thing sparkle.<br />It's a difficult movie, and you MUST watch it with your full attention.  But you'll be sure to discuss this for a long time afterwards.  <br />Not for little kids, mostly because they'll never get what the heck is going on!!!
0385720920|5.0|This book was by far the most interesting of all of his books.  and I've read all of them, diary [stinks], I started this book at midnight the day president bush invaded Iraq and finished at 7:07 the same morning.  I only put it down twice to pee and check the war.  There is so much great sex and bizzare addict behavior and colonial times reinactments that I laughed, cried, jerked off, and felt so good that I'm not a real sex-addict that I made my girlfriend read it and she jumped my bones.  This WILL be a movie and it is worth the time of anyone who put a slight effort into Fight Club, which doesn't even compare to Choke.  If you read this book and aren't satisfied there is something serously wrong with you.
B000050HTO|4.0|Some people will say that you must get every Dylan album before you get a collection, and though I understand the point, most of us dont want to buy 20 albums of the same artist. This 2-disc set is exactly what I was looking for. 30 tracks of some of his best, one cd of early work, and one of his later work. &quot;Subterranean Homesick Blues&quot;, &quot;Lay Lady Lay&quot;, and &quot;Not Dark Yet&quot; have to be some of my favorites. Since I am not a Dylan die-hard, I can actually not think of one song that I am missing from this. I'm sure someone could come up with another disc of classic stuff, but for me, the casual fan, this is what's essential.
B00005A46T|5.0|for those of you who dont like hard music, you should know that most of the bands make hard music so that fans can get out negative emotions through the music and not actions. or if they do release through negative actions its in a place where its expexted and even welcome from the people around...like a mosh pit. thanks for taking time to read this.<br />          mike evans<BR>          pfc u.s. army
B00007LL7O|4.0|I don't think this is the best I've heard from Stratovarius, but it is quite good. Standout tracks are the Eagleheart (this is in the style of classic Stratovarius metal anthem), Learning to Fly, Stratofortress, and Elements. Timo Tolkki does a fantastic job on guitar here. Unfortunately, Timo Kotipelti is not quite up to par. He's a very talented singer, but he's really trying to hit notes so high that they just can't sound right even in key. It really hurts the ears in some places in that regard. The addition of the orchestra is a plus on this album. This album also takes more of a progressive turn than their older stuff, using less of the same old steady beat power metal. One other thing worth mentioning is that it seems that a lot of this music is aimed at being a stab against concepts of religion and God. I won't get into the specifics; read the lyrics if you need to know. While this doesn't bother me at all, readers who are strongly religious may want to take this into consideration.
B000002ADT|3.0|I own about 25 Miles Davis cds, and Kind of Blue is perhaps my least favorite.  It has a distant, cold, soul-less quality, like it was produced too well or something.  It is too serious and tense.  (I realize it is called &quot;Kind of Blue&quot; and maybe that's the point, but it's too dark).  I am not saying the musicians are not great, or that the blowing isn't good.  But this record lacks the spontaneity and the warmth that mark Miles' best stuff.  I would much rather hear Cookin', Relaxin', and those other records from a few years prior
B000089RVX|5.0|i was a bit skeptical when this cd came out. i'd thought this band would be a diisapointment like the donnas or the distillers but i was surprised from the moment i pressed play. some may say her voice is too perfect for &quot;goth rock&quot; (i hate that term), but that makes the expierience so much better. its new and unexpected which makes it that much better. the stand out track, by far, is &quot;My Immortal&quot;. for once a hard rock band,driven by distortion,put a piano only track on the cd and they hit the nail on the head. Amy's true beauty shines the brightest on this song and no song will come close to this beauty. if you want a taste of something new, try evanescence. you'll enjoy.
B000059XUO|5.0|I know there are other reviews about this movie, but I have to add mine. This is my favorite film of all time, of any film. It has all the elements that a great film should have - it's dark and romantic; it has action, a fabulous plot, great characters, and an awesome soundtrack to boot.<BR>What stands out for me most in this film is the incredible Brandon Lee, (R.I.P.), in what was his first and unfortunately last film with a major starring role. He is passionate and vulnerable and utterly believable as Eric, the murdered lover back from the dead to avenge himself and his fiance. His scenes with his young friend Sarah and police Officer Albrecht are touching and funny, and as well done as his physical fighting. Brandon was on his way to a bright career. The real life tragedy attached to this film only serves to make it even more haunting.<BR>Just as a quick aside, the sequels are decent flicks, but nothing can compare to the original. <BR>We all secretly long for someone to love us so deeply that their love transcends time and death. That is what speaks to me in this film. I recommend it 100 times over.
0385335482|5.0|2 paragraphs into the book, I said to myself, &quot;This book is so understanding of who I am.&quot;  I immediately fell in love with it and all of the characters in it.    The main character, Becky Bloomwood, justifies everything I am and love about myself and my life.  I have already read the next 2 in the series, and felt exactly the same way.  An excellent book for all who enjoy shopping, regardless for what, and lots of laughs!
B0000013GT|5.0|Outkast's (Andre Benjamin &amp; Big Boi) 2nd album &quot;Atliens&quot; (1996) is in my opinion a Hip Hop classic.  This is a fifteen track release, which is executive produced by A.  Reid, K.  Edmonds &amp; Organized Productions.  This album is amazing in that Outkast goes real deep, gets real innovative and really takes there listners to another world with addictive insightful lyricism, memorable beats which are enhanced by excellent background vocals from the likes of:  D.  Killings, EJ tha Witch Doctor,Joe,Whild Peach,Trina,Dawn,Tracy,Arylnn, Sleepy Brown, A.  Martin, Cee-Lo Green, Khujo, T-Bu, Cool Breeze, Big Gipp, Tamara &amp; S.  Edgill.  Never seen a Hip Hop album cover/insert like this one, very unique like Outkast's music.  Album opens with the calming &quot;You May Die&quot; ( Intro), which is followed up the less than calm &quot;Two Dope Boys&quot; (In a Cadillac ), which has the dynamic duo talking about wack rappers, rides and more.  This is followed up by the albums title track a wicked track, with an addictive chorus from Andre. Guitar backed &quot;Wheelz of Steel&quot; is about learning life's lessons, child birth, and Aids.  &quot;Jazzy Belle&quot; is laced with some very nice background female vocals, and has Outkast talking about the ladies, its really about the downfall *some* woman go through.  Next comes the albums lead single &quot;Elevators&quot; (Me &amp; You) a track where Outkast reminiscence about growing up, getting blunted and making it in the rap game.  &quot;Babylon&quot; is another memorable track. The albums shortest track is &quot;Wailin&quot; and I recently realized where Prodigy got the beat for one of his tracks on his album H.N.I.C., needless to say its a ill beat.  Outkast gets deeper on the &quot;Mainstream&quot; feat.  Goodie Mob, and mention how they strive to be innovative on &quot;Millenium&quot;. Andre and Big Boi each drop excellent verses on &quot;E.T.&quot; (Extraterrestrial).  Big Rube does the intro on &quot;13th Floor/Growing Old&quot; a very deep sad sounding track, where Outkast take there listners to new heights and Debra Killings drops a beautiful chorus. The ONIP BG Mix of &quot;Elevators&quot; finishes the album off.  Outkast have never disappointed me, &quot;Atliens&quot; is a gem to enjoy, an album with a very memorable vibe from start to finish, a release for any Hip Hop collection.
B00005IC2H|5.0|Sigur Ros is a [band] the defies any kind or rational description. The haunting melodies and startling musicianship of this disk are so far beyond description that a simple critique would be left wanting, regardless of the critic. One must listen to Agaetis Byrjun to understand my complete lack of words in this review. Suffice it to say that from a pure diet of Opeth, Porcupine Tree, Godspeed You! Black Emperor, Gordian Knot, Staind, and Cold, Sigur is a complete breath of fresh and liberating air. I have never heard such mesmerizing music in my life...almost even better than ( ), Sigur Ros' last breathtaking release. For those seeking ambiance and purely liberating soundscapes, AB is your ticket. Grab a glass of your best wine and enjoy. Incredible and HIGHLY recommended.
B0000029DD|5.0|Whenever I listen to Jeff Buckley, I can't help but think of what kind of records he would be making if he were alive today.  It saddens me to think that he would have only grown musically, but the music that was given to us is truly priceless.    This album is a staple in my collection.  Jeff Buckley's music possess' a passion to it that's amazing. I remember describing Jeff's voice when he reached high octaves as a spiritual experience to a friend of mine once.  My favorites are \\"So Real,\\" \\"Dream Brother,\\" and \\"Lover, You Should Have Come Over.\\"  As a poetry lover, his lyrics come off as just that to me.  I've heard a lot of his fans say that Buckley's death is one they don't think they'll ever truly get over. I won't necessarily admit to that, but I think I can speak for all of his fans when saying that our lives have been blessed with his gift.  It's amazing to see how many other lives his music has touched and I'm more than willing to sing his praises to convert the masses.
B00008EY9G|5.0|Identity is the finest mystery/thriller movie to grace the screen since Hitchcock, I kid you not. With an outstanding ensemble cast, led by the incredibly talented John Cusack, James Mangold (director) has created a masterpiece. To explain any of the plot would give away most of Identity's charm, so I won't do that. BUT, this script is fantastic. I was mesmerized throughout the film, and floored by the climax. This is an absolute must have for fans of good cinema. Amanda Peet is wonderful as Paris. Ray Liotta is riveting as usual. Clea Duvall, John McGinley, and Jake Busey are all perfectly cast. And Rebecca DeMornay could possible call this her comback film. Eventhough Identity was panned by audiences during its theatrical run, I can honestly say that this is now one of my top five favorite films. HIGHLY recommended.
B00006LLNU|5.0|I was first introduced to Sigur Ros when I heard their music used in &quot;Vanilla Sky.&quot;  I got their first album and was amazed at how different and unique it was compared to everything else. Ethereal is the word I use more than anything to describe these guys. Just about everyone I knew who was a fan of theirs said that their music was perfect for making love and that comment stuck out for me. However, the song that I just had to have was Track 4 (I call it &quot;The Nothing Song.&quot;)  That song got me obsessed after watching &quot;Vanilla Sky&quot; and after listening to live versions of it for months I wanted a studio version.<BR>The day this album was released, I remember purchasing it after taking a big psychology test.  I was immediately put under their spell and it's one that I don't plan on leaving anytime soon.<BR>The pieces that stick out for me are 1 &quot;Passage,&quot; 8 &quot;The Telling,&quot; and my precious favorite 4 &quot;The Nothing Song.&quot;  I also find 3 &quot;Field Trip&quot; relaxes me when I can't fall asleep.  Another thing I love about this album is the whole approach of having the listener title the tracks and write for themselves on the blank booklet pages what the songs are to them.  I'm not saying that it's way ahead of its time, but it is something you don't see often.<BR>I love listening to this album when it's raining outside.  I put it in my cd player, turn the volume up and listen.  I'm also planning on doing an interpretive writing to this album soon.<BR>Add a kick of eclecticism to your music collection with these guys.  You won't regret it.

Released<BR>toward the end of the sixty's decade where people's views at<BR>what they watched were changing rapidly and modern western a<BR>mere memory (Sam peckinpah's slow motion ballets of Blood to<br />the Italian imports) to the old hand animation slowly losing<BR>it's footing This film remains an oddity in itself as family<BR>entertainment,Harryhausen at this stage of his game has time<br />to dig up an ode to an earlier project of Willis o Brien and<BR>his version of cowboys ropeing dinosaurs seemingly redone in<BR>1947 from Mighty Joe Young.

0385504209|5.0|Sub line (As far as we know).<br />Two secret and covert groups have been squaring off since the time of Jesus. One's the Catholic Church, the other, a group of knights who don't want the Church to let the world know that Jesus was a real man who lived an earthly life more than they're telling us.<br />This story is great from the get-go. And even better, as far as I can tell, it's pretty accurate. If you've ever read Holy Blood Holy Grail, The Templar Revelation, The Hiram Key or any other of the &quot;nonfiction&quot; books out there about this subject, then here's a nail-biter of a narrative, and you know what's going on the whole time.<br />If you haven't studied these other selections, than this is just the primer to do so. My wife always asks why I read all this conspiracy stuff, but after this book, she's hooked, too.<br />If you like historical fiction, you can't do better than this!
B00004U9MS|5.0|I think this album is just more than a bestseller, it's a classic. Its even better than 'A Rush Of Blood To The Head'.If you like the album 'A Rush Of Blood' this album is definately a permenant resident of your cd-player.
B00005V3Z4|5.0|If you enjoy movies that make you think, or movies that go beyond on ending.  I'm sure you like this.  Its &quot;DARK&quot; deminer is just a little reminder that life isnt all peaches.  The little conversations that random character have are something to pay attention to when you demaindingly watch it the 4th or 5th time.  They give insite to pretty much all those big life question everyone and there kids ask.  This movie is an Universe in and of itself, which as you know is a what makes a classic film.  No doubt that this is one of the best movies I have scene and bought in a long time.
B0000640VO|5.0|Up to a challenge?  Watch this movie and try to feel bad about life. AmelieÕs humor comes into lush and stylish flower like a garden.  It is a very human story about people of ordinary means and the power of love.  It uses devices that made movies like Babe and its sequel so charming, inventive and thoughtfull, tickling the senses with its rich use of color, sound, comedy, sexuality and characterizations.  The actors all look like everyday people. Audrey Tautou is fun to watch as Amelie, and I can't help thinking that she is like a mix of Audrey Hepburn and Lucille Ball. I would pair this movie with Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown, Strictly Ballroom, Run Lola Run or Don Juan de Marco.
B000008HZB|5.0|This is a great album; highest quality production and catchy tunes.  It is one of those recordings that stays in your head, and you don't try to get rid of it!  Jeff Lynne made his name with ELO and, while there are a few moments when you can catch the resemblence, he makes the grade here as a lead vocalist with a wide variety of musical styles and moods.  It should have received much more acclaim.  Since it appears to be out of print, I've been able to pick up a couple extra copies just in case something happens to the first one.  A must-have.
B00005JLSE|1.0|I have to admit - I couldn't sit through the whole thing. We skipped through the middle and most of the musical numbers (most of which were terrible). <br />Since there were no &quot;good guys&quot; in this movie, I just hoped that justice would prevail. It didn't. Just a bunch of rotten folks ruining their lives and taking others and singing up a storm about it. The only one in this movie who can really sing is Queen Latifah, and her talent was wasted in this film.<br />And the acting - AWFUL! So amateurish and over-the-top. It was like watching a macabre human cartoon.<br />I am both amazed and utterly disappointed that a film like this could win an Oscar.
B00003OSU4|5.0|While I've not seen other Jazz movies or documentaries, I've seen Jazz on a Summer's Day on both VHS and on DVD and enjoy it so much that I've watched it several times and just had to purchase it on DVD.<br />I have always loved the classic Jazz of the 1950's and 1960's and this film documents one of the best Jazz festivals around, and I think this was the first Jazz festival in what we now know as the Newport Jazz festival. <br />What I love about this film is how Bert Stern uses his movie camera to shoot the film, much like a still camera and framed the shots just the same. I find it works on motion film as on still photography, especially in this kind of documentary where your documenting a concert. I love the B-roll shots of kids playing, grown ups sunbathing, the dixieland jazz band, the couples driving their vintage autos, and of course the Yaught(sp?) club races and overall, I find that Bert Stern does an incredible job of showing the general atmosphere of the concert and the weather of late summer in Rhode Island.<br />I find this an incredible film that is worthy of multiple viewings. Not just for it's incredible of shooting techniques, but for the music that is represented here. Lots of great names such as Anita O'Day, Thelonious Munk, George Shearing, Dina Washington etc. I love Bert's use of the reflections of the boats on the water for the opening sequence, mated to Jimmy Giuffrie's live rendition of the Train and the River. All in all, I rate this film a definate 5.
B00000F1D3|5.0|I love this album.  She is one of the few people that can get away with a voice like her and be that successful.  It is not bad, it is just different.  I love all the music. Great!
B00006AW2P|5.0|I bought the original 1964 London vinyl pressing off a friend of mine in 1988, when I was 14. His dad had it, the cover was intriguing, and he needed a few bucks, so I gave him a $20, and thus started myself on a love affair of early Stones albums from the 60's since then. I was hooked on this record in a way that is quite indesctibeable, going so far as buying 5 or 6 different vinyl versions (Japanese, Decca pressing blue vinyl version is one of my most prized possessions.) This is NOT the best effort they ever recorded. Mick was not the same Mick he became post-Sympathy period. They were still doing Chuck Berry when my other favorite band the Beatles were writing their first film soundtrack, and though they were never recorded in the same quality that their Liverpool counterparts were, I could honestly care less, because this is pure Rolling Stones: garage band rythym and blues covers by five guys that knew their stuff. The Stones were always interpreters of this genre (as well as blues), and they were very successful at it. Rather than give a track run down here, I'll just say that the highlights are the Buddy Holly classic &quot;Not Fade Away&quot;, &quot;Route 66&quot;, &quot;Carol&quot;, and &quot;King Bee&quot;. I like all these songs on here, including one of Mick and Keith's first songwriting ventures, &quot;Tell Me&quot;. For as heavily touted as their late 60's, early 70's work was, to me the Rolling Stones most interesting, and influential work, will always be the original line-up and those early albums, '63-'69. The only thing lacking on this US version was the exclusion of Bo Diddley's &quot;Hey Mona&quot;, that replaced &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; on the UK version. Like The Beatles, stick to the UK versions, but aside from that, this is a fine little record!
B00000I8UJ|4.0|When it comes to 'bop', I can be very picky - especially with the saxmen. &quot;Our Man In Paris&quot;, I do not like. This one, however - &quot;GO!&quot; -  with Sonny Clarke, Billy Higgins, and Butch Warren starts out smokin' with &quot;Cheese Cake&quot;, then shows Dexter's grasp of great ballad playing, grooves with (my second favorite cut) &quot;Second Balcony Jump&quot;, and moves to a standard (my favorite track) &quot;Love For Sale&quot;...man, Dexter really shows me something on this one. I read a review where it was said that Dex was boring here and sticking too much to the melody. I guess I'm a 180 degree turn from that...to me, melody is damn near EVERYTHING (and harmony, and rhythm..) I wonder if that person would dislike Trane's &quot;Ballads&quot;? No, for me Dexter is doing it right on this one...and his 'over-allusions&quot; to other tunes is hilarious. Sonny Clarke plays off Dexter well, and Billy Higgins is great...always listening. Unfortunately, for me, my CD is not the 'Remastered' version, and Butch is hard to hear. I'll bet the 'Remaster' kills... This is a really good one.
B000089RVX|5.0|Short of breathtaking, I have no other way to describe Evanescence.  They have a sound like no other band I have ever heard.  Amy's sometimes-opera like vocals and Ben's heavy guitars mesh well when one wouldn't think they could.  I'll comment on each song for the fun of it:<BR>1. Going Under is a really catchy rock song, you've most likely heard it.<BR>2. Bring Me To Life: \\"made\\" the band, you could say.  An aberration from their normal sound, I think.<BR>3. Everybody's Fool: I love this song, it's pretty catchy but still rock enough to kick butt.<BR>4. My Immortal: Makes me want to cry.  One of the prettiest ballads I've ever heard.<BR>5. Haunted: What Amy and Ben said they wanted to sound like all along.<BR>6. Tourniquet: A strange view on suicide.  It makes you realize why people called them a Christian band.<BR>7. Imaginary: I don't know if I like this version better or the version on Origin better but it's my favorite Evanescence song.  Gorgeous imagery.<BR>8. Taking Over Me: I like it, but I don't love it as much as most songs.  <BR>9. Hello: Another haunting song that's not really a ballad, but definitely not rock.<BR>10. My Last Breath: The lyrics are the best on the album when you focus on them.<BR>11. Whisper: Amazing lyrics.  Would make a really good next single for alternative radio.<br />That's the end, hope my opinions swayed you in the way of buying it.  If you like Fallen, check out Origin and some of their older stuff too.
B00009RDG9|1.0|I would have rated it FIVE negative stars if the movie rating icon was there for that, for this is a totally stinker of a movie.. I would be ashamed to tell an adult or child with an I.Q. above 100 that I viewed it or was an actor in it.. As for acting, this was worse than the worst of the 50's B movies, at least they good act.. Okay, I'm wandering here, let me be clear, I feel like I was robbed buying this movie.. Okay, I will stop beating this dead horse.... Thank you
B000084T18|5.0|This is by far the best cd i have eva bought! I luv every SONG! U r really gettin' ur money's worth by purchasing 50 Cent! I personally think that he is da best new artist and he has practically blown eminem outa da park! Hands down, no holdin' back, 50 has da best album of da year and with songs like If I Can't and Back Down, how can this cd be ne thang short of AWESUM!
B000084T18|5.0|50 in my view is easily the best rapper around, i dunno wat it is it maybe coz he has a mixture of gangster attiude with the higly focused rapper attitude maybe dats why he is so big. Anyway i have been listening to 50s music for years but only now i have seen after his shooting his voice developed a sort of metaphorfises from a good mc to a phenomenon. Get rich or die tryin does definetly do 50s capabilities justice its easily his best album yet. As they say for 50 &quot;SKY IS THE LIMIT&quot;
0440236738|5.0|I couldn't put it down and I've lent it everyone I can think of.  If you are going on a plane ride or just sitting on the beach this is the book for you!
B00005JKC3|5.0|People who whine about \\"bad CGI\\" or \\"slow pacing\\" are awesome.  Why?  Because the louder they scream, the better I know the movie is.<br />That's the case with \\"The Hulk.\\"  This is a movie that surprised everyone by not being the movie that anyone expected it to be.  It was a movie that, after seeing it on opening night, made me ask, \\"what the hell was that?\\"  The answer of course turned out to be, \\"Brilliant!\\"  It's that kind of movie.  It hits you from behind and doesn't let you recover for a couple of weeks.<br />This is definitely not Spider-Man.  But then it's not called Spider-Man, so why anyone would expect it to be, I don't know.  Like the ol' Webhead, Hulk is one of Marvel's flagship characters.  But he's a completely different kind of character, and this is a different kind of movie.  Hulk's not really a hero.  He's a monster, but an essentially noble one.<br />Complaints about the CGI?  Cry me a river.  Anybody who trashes the CG in a movie does it for only one reason.  Attention.  So to those people I say:  that's nice, Billy.  I'll stick that review on the fridge, right next to your last report card.  Hulk is the second-best CG character ever put to film - after Gollum from \\"The Lord of the Rings.\\"<br />Don't judge a movie by it's box office, but by the content of the film.  And this is an incredible film.
B00005JLIU|2.0|I was going to give this movie 1 star until I realized that I gave \\"Moulin Rouge\\" that ranking, and I can't possibly hate a movie as much as that one.<br />You might think from my ratings of these two movie musicals that I don't like movie musicals.  Not so.  I like GOOD movie musicals, not stinky ones like this.  I wish I could have been a fly on the wall when the powers that be sat around the table planning this one.  Actually, on paper \\"Thoroughly Modern Millie\\" doesn't look half bad, so maybe it's the final screening I would have loved to have spied on.  What were they thinking?<br />If this movie had ended at intermission, it wouldn't have been so bad.  As it is, this one is deadly, and it doesn't help that it comes in at a [mind]-numbing 2 1/2 hours.  No one, but no one comes out the better for having been involved with this movie.  Let's just start with Julie Andrews, since she is the star of the show.  She's completely miscast, and about 15 years too old for the part.  She does her best to make something of this mess, but too frequently simply gives up and resorts to playing her part like Maria from \\"The Sound of Music\\" (a movie musical I liked, by the way).  <br />James Fox, who plays her love interest, is almost unbearably mannered in his performance, with a full repertoire of facial contortions and nervous tics that will send you to the kitchen for countless refills of popcorn, long after the popcorn is gone.<br />Mary Tyler Moore is simply dreadful in the most thankless role ever put to screen.  I was shocked to learn that she was already starring in \\"The Mary Tyler Moore\\" show when this came out, but then I remembered that she had also been in the \\"Dick Van Dyke Show,\\" so she has no excuse for being so rotten.<br />Beatrice Lillie as the villianess might have been funny if she was given anything funny to do.<br />Carol Channing is Carol Channing, weird and hyper.  However, she alone of the cast seems to know what the hell she's doing, and any scene involving her ends up being a highlight of the film.<br />I don't know why they decided to make this a musical.  Musicals were gasping for breath by 1967 anyway; for every \\"My Fair Lady\\" or \\"The Sound of Music,\\" there was a \\"Doctor Dolittle\\" and \\"Camelot.\\"  The music in \\"Millie\\" seems added on as an afterthought, since hardly any of the songs have anything to do with the plot, and director George Roy Hill couldn't direct a musical number if his life depended on it.<br />Speaking of Hill, I'll save my last comments for him.  He's all wrong for this film.  I'm assuming the movie was intended to be a satirical send-up of 20's silent melodramas, since it comes complete with reaction shots aimed directly at the camera and title cards elaborating on characters' emotions.  But if that's so, why does Hill set everything to such a plodding pace?  The thing staggers along like a rabid dog before finally collapsing under the weight of its inanity.  One wishes Atticus Finch would emerge from behind a tree and put this particular rabid dog (and the audience) out of its misery.<br />You know what the most memorable thing about this movie is?  The title song.  You'll be singing it for days and days and days and days afterwards.  Enjoy.<br />Grade: D- (because only \\"Moulin Rouge\\" is entitled to a grade of F)
B00005QZWJ|5.0|As a fan of &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; even before Peter Jackson's film adaptation hit the cinemas, I had a lot of reservations about that film, and a lot of very demanding expectations.  <br />Amazingly, Jackson and his crew didn't disappoint.  <br />But a truly great film comes with a classic score - the kind of score that haunts you long after the movie has left the local multiplex.  The kind of score that pops suddenly into your head when you think about the film, or anything related to the film.  <br />Howard Shore has written that kind of score for &quot;The Lord of the Rings.&quot;  It's right up there with any of John Williams' best work for &quot;Star Wars&quot; or &quot;Superman,&quot; or Basil Pouledoris' classic score for &quot;Conan the Barbarian.&quot;  <br />In some ways, Shore's LOTR work is better than those other works.  I'm a &quot;word&quot; person.  I don't listen to a lot of classical music and it's rare that an instrumental piece can move me to tears, or really generate any kind of emotional response in me, but Shore's score does.  <br />I've come to the conclusion that the brilliance of it is in his method of creating musical themes that suit each culture featured in the narrative.  J.R.R. Tolkien was a philologist, and so he built these cultures out of language.  Music is a language of its own, and Shore has managed to create a musical language for each of the cultures, whether it is Hobbits, Elves, Dwarves, The Dark Lord Sauron, or Saruman's Fighting Uruk-Hai.  <br />The &quot;Bridge of Khazad-Dum&quot; sequence is a startling vocal performance that is far beyond comparative pieces in Pouledoris' &quot;Conan&quot; or Williams' &quot;The Phantom Menace.&quot;  And it is yet another example of how Shore has created Middle-Earth in music: the vocal performances all feature Tolkien's invented languages.  <br />The album closes with a haunting melody by a boy soprano (this one in English) that echoes Frodo's decision at the end of &quot;Fellowship,&quot; and the song &quot;May It Be&quot; by Enya, which is the perfect closer for the album and the film, hitting all the right emotional cues about holding to hope and pressing on into danger in spite of hopelessness.  The soundtrack alone is about as moving as the film, or indeed the book by Tolkien.  <br />To anyone who likes this album I also highly recommend Shore's score for &quot;The Two Towers,&quot; which is the natural companion piece to this one.  That album expands upon the musical themes established in &quot;Fellowship,&quot; and takes them to darker and more troubled places, as well as adding new musical themes for the Rohirrim, the Ents, and Gollum.  There are moments of beauty and moments of violence and a peformance by Emiliana Torrini that is an excellent follow-up to Enya's Grammy-nominated song from &quot;Fellowship.&quot;<br />Only a couple months left until Shore's &quot;Return of the King&quot; hits stores.  I'm already excited.  I can't wait to hear the rest of this cycle.
B00005JLYW|1.0|People don't you get it? You're being insulted by hollywood. They know that you will spend money just to see young actractive no-talent actresses in a softcore porn movie with no plot, story, brains, this film is completely void of everything, it's sole purpose was to cash in on the first piece of junk. Please people, aren't you tired of watching trendy trash. Why don't you guys stop seeing these films and see good films, like Dead Poet's Society or Citizen Kane. Movies that had acting, plot, and characters. Quite watching advertising movies that show off everything hollywood says you should have. These movies basically say \\"you're not cool unless you dress like this and go along with the latest trends.\\" Think for yourself, and if trash like this is your thing, then I'm sorry. I just think the old \\"sex sells\\" thing is getting old, but then again this is america, do you what you want, live how you want and not how you should, we think with our private parts, we kill our babies and worship nudity. I'm \\"proud\\" to be an \\"american.\\"
0553573403|5.0|I have two catagories for favorites. Tolkien wins \\"Favorite author\\", but Martin has stolen the \\"Favorite series\\" with his spectacular \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\", beginning with A Game of Thrones. This massive doorstopper will disappear suprisingly fast once you get into the flow of things.<br />The basic (and note that this is basic-Martin loves big plots) plot focuses on the Stark and Baratheon Houses, and begins what will become, for the Seven Kingdoms, an ultimate battle against eachother for kingship, and for those who realize it, a battle for the survival of mankind. This book sets up a projected now seven book-long series. Readers must be prepared for long, long waits, because Martin is one of the good oldfashioned believers in quality, something missing from the fantasy world today. Characters die with stunning frequency which only increases as the series progresses, and language, sex, and violence are not for the weak-stomached. An excellent series, this is one of the few that trandecends the mass market for fantasy today, and will, I believe, survive long after the last of the contemporary Wheel of Time books and such have faded...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|This show is groundbreaking in its conception for three reasons:<br />1.  The combination of genres was surprisingly effective.  Honestly, I cringed the first time I heard about the then soon-to-premeier \\"science fiction western.\\"  But I watched it anyway, and it worked.<br />2.  The inclusion of a main character who is a prostitute is adventurous.  But even more, this is a society in which prostitutes are held in the highest esteem and treated like honored dignitaries.  That's daring and thought provoking.<br />3.  Most impressive (to me) was the fact that the show mixed Mandarin Chinese words and phrases in with the dialogue, smoothly, and without subtitled translation.  The Mandarin was always included in such a way that you could figure out what the essential meaning was from the context (a guy walks up to a bar, says something in Mandarin, and then gets handed a drink, for example).<br />Mandarin provided a unique flavor to the show and a bit of socio-political background:  clearly, in this future, Chinese culture has remained powerful, so much so that the language pervades the society and is spoken by pretty much everyone.  Chinese culture, too, keeps subtly appearing.  The prostitute does Chinese caligraphy in her spare time.<br />Too bad the show didn't last long enough for us to uncover much of the backstory of this future vision.  It was certainly an intriguing one.

B0000AGQ6Z|5.0|I  won't review the movie.  That's all been said before.  And reading the other reviews will make you aware of the extraordinary restoration effort that was  put into this masterpiece for its re-release  in 70 mm 15 years ago.  But no matter how good that release was, it didn't translate well to home video. I've had a VHS version and also own the DVD release from two years ago.  That deluxe disc set had the entire three-hour plus film on one disc and was not properly color corrected.  (The second disc IS chock full of newsreel footage and other extras if you enjoy that sort of thing)<br />Now comes the Superbit release, which spreads the movie across two discs, dramatically increasing the bit rate.  For once, Superbit really comes through and great  improves the DVD  experience.  There are no extras.  But the quality of the video is  amazing.  Key to this  was the involvement in this edition of Robert Harris,  who  worked with David Lean and the film's cinematographer on the 1988 restoration. Mr. Harris details on thedigitalbits.com the time spent on this new DVD release to get everything right.  <br />The results are excellent. It's like a veil was lifted from the film to fully reveal the magnificent details of the desert landscapes. The  5.1  and DTS  mixes  are also top notch.<br />Whatever you have heard about Superbit, this is the version of the title to own and one of the major DVD releases of this or any other year.  If  you enjoy this film, you owe it  to yourself to rent or buy this version.
B00004Y7SF|5.0|Though she's not doing the traditional stuff, her rendition of Merry Christmas Baby is quite entertaining.  I really like the dancey tunes on this album... Lotsa people say it doesn't sound like a Christmas record, but this is the one I put on when I decorate the tree cuz it get's me hyped up and jumpin.  I really like all the tracks on here, I hope you will too.
B000002KOG|4.0|Neil's first solo album and the foundation of his signature sound (which he would perfect with his very next album) is here, but just a little more polished and (perhaps over?)produced.  However, Neil was penning so many outright masterpieces around this time, the material overcomes the uneven production for a great listen.  Recommended if you already know you like him.
B0000028UK|5.0|Vs. is a truly great album. I personally enjoy this one more than Ten, but that's just my preference. Some of Pearl Jam's best songs can be found on this cd. My favorite songs are &quot;Rearviewmirror&quot;, &quot;Go&quot;, &quot;Dissident&quot;, and &quot;Rats&quot;. If you are a fan of Ten, you will most likely like this cd.
B000002LR6|5.0|Darker, edgier, and more accessible than their previous &quot;The Mind is a Terrible Thing to Taste&quot;; Ministry found themselves at their peak with &quot;Psalm 69&quot;.  Roaring opener &quot;N.W.O.&quot; features then President George Bush declaring a New World Order in an endless tape loop while the thrash metal guitar and industrial carnage play in the background.  &quot;Just One Fix&quot; is undeniably catchy (especially the guitar) and became a fan favorite (also, note the similarities between the sound of the song, or the band as a whole for that matter, and many Rammstein songs and you'll find similarities that may be or not be intentional on the latter band's part), while the classic &quot;Jesus Built My Hotrod&quot; became Ministry's most well known song and helped propel &quot;Psalm 69&quot; to platinum status.  Other songs including &quot;Corrosion&quot;, &quot;TV II&quot;, and the title track are all fantastic tracks, and make &quot;Psalm 69&quot; the definitive Ministry album.  All in all, if you've never listened to Ministry before but are looking for a good place to start, then consider this essential listening.
0783232039|4.0|For some reason this one is the most funniest since part 2 and 3.a whole new plot has Chucky brought to life by his unmentioned girlfriend named Tiffany,a human girl that resurrected Chucky with voodoo and now Chucky is stitched new after he got chopped in part 3 and the trouble starts because Chucky and Tiffany fight and then he electrocutes her then makes her into a doll.the most goriest and funniest one has Graeme Revell{Child's play 2}scary music score and in the beginning if you look hard you can see Jason's hockey mask and Leatherface's chainsaw.only reason this is not a 5 star is because the DVD has no deleted scenes .
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I'll get straight to the point here: what Iron Maiden has done on this album is nothing short of astounding. A band this far into their career, and still able to craft an album this calibur is a rarity these days. With a release of this magnitude, it's a safe bet that as long as the band can draw breath, they'll still be creating music. They're more than capable. All of the band is in the top of their game. Bruce has never sounded better, his vocals here could just as easily stood on his Maiden debut, The Number of the Beast. And that's not a bad thing in the slightest. The triple axe assault of Murray, Smith and Gers feels more comfortable than on Brave New World, with all three guitarists sharing solos, melodies, and harmonies. Steve Harris' bass keeps things moving, and there's not a boring moment in his playing. Nicko provides the beat and does a stellar job, even contributing to the album by helping pen the song New Frontier. The songs themselves are chock full of nostalgia, bringing back memories of a bewildering variety of past Maiden songs. Yet each one sounds fresh; it's conceivable that songs like Paschendale, The Rainmaker, No More Lies, Wildest Dreams, Dance of Death, Face In The Sand, and The Journeyman could all become live classics (not that they all will, Maiden's classic list is quite extensive, but they all have the potential).<br />In an era where almost all of the metal icons of the 80's have vanished entirely or turned into mere shadows of their former selves, it's comforting to see that Iron Maiden still have it. This album is proof that Iron Maiden are the kings of the heavy metal realm, and they're not going to give up their crown anytime soon (certainly, not without a fight). Up the Irons!!!
B00003CXRP|5.0|Although many people enjoy the high-flying, loud, skull-thumping action movies that Hollywood jabs down our throats, Cast Away proves that some filmmakers attempt to break the mold.  The movie begins with a beautiful image:  the desolate Texas plains.  As the movie moves along, we are introduced to Chuck Noland, a live-by-the-clock systems engineer for FedEx.  His fast-paced lifestyle is rudely interrupted by a plane crash, leaving him stranded on an island with only his wits, a pair of ice skates, and a marraige dissolution.  I found this middle section to be intriguing because it is a kind of &quot;silent movie:&quot;  visual pictures are painted and we don't need dialogue or a cheesy, sappy score to ruin it.  I think this is the best attribute of the movie:  Silvestri wrote only a 10-minute score which is only heard as Chuck escapes the island.  As Chuck is found and he rediscovers himself, we are treated with fascinating twists.  First, he DOES NOT win the girl back, which is typical of most Hollywood nonsense.  Also, the heart-felt ending leaves much to the imagination.  A visual feast for all.  The best movie ever made.
B000060P79|3.0|ill have to say that their r okay,but its not like there fantastic they live up to there name &quot;SIMPLE&quot; though they have there &quot;okay this a nice song&quot;.i personllly dont have a favorite and i wish i had bought something else but for you guys just getting into &quot;punk rock&quot; you might as well give it a try???!!!!!<BR>though i recommend all of the good charlotte cds,rancid (any of there albums),sum 41,mest, all-american rejects and tons more ARE BETTER, so reallly its up too you i heard they were great and i thought not,its different for every one.so...................uh yeah.
0156027321|2.0|After reading such great reviews of &quot;The Life of Pi,&quot; I couldn't wait to get my hands on it.  It was a huge disappointment.  The first one hundred pages were slow and painful.  After completing the book, I was bummed to find the whole story a hoax.  I think this author is very overrated, and would recommend &quot;The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time,&quot; if you are interested in an excellent, fresh new author.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I haven't drooled this much over guitar sounds since Butch Vig's production job on Nevermind. If you need to believe in rock guitar, buy The White Stripe's Elephant. <BR>Jack White delivers a delicious array of ferocious guitar sounds -- he takes classic rock guitar to a new level with massive grit, sonic bomb drops, and tubular high-note bends that would make Jimi, Pete, Kurt, and Mark Bolan proud. As a singer, songwriter, and guitarist, Mr. White is Generation Y's Marc Bolan -- this from a devoted T. Rex fan. <BR>I have to mention Meg White (she's the real White -- Jack uses a pseudonym, and apparently they aren't siblings or husband and wife). She plays drums with a simplicity that would make Charlie Watts (and Mo Tucker) proud. Without synchopation, tom rolls, or rolls of any kind, Meg lays down the beat so solidly that we don't miss the bass. <BR>For its economy of sound and expressive use of limited instrumentation, Elephant is a classic. I was surprised to learn that the album was recorded in analog on an 8-track. The White Stripes are from Detroit, but they sound British somehow -- maybe it's that they recorded in England, maybe it's their cool art-school imagery. (Their Saturday Night Live appearance is burned into my visual memory.)  Keep rock alive with Elephant.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Maiden is back and they are more hardcore then ever. <BR>*WARNING* This album is not for cry babies this is only for the hardest of the hardcore fans. I would say this is probably their bes album since seventh son of a seventh son. Janieck Gers solos rip this album and Bruce Dickinson's vocals sound amazing.
0142004235|3.0|I feel almost guilty for not liking this book more.  <br />I was excited to read East of Eden. I think it is fabulous that Oprah decided to reinstate her book club with a focus on the classics.  In addition, \\"Of Mice and Men\\" and \\"Grapes of Wrath\\" were highpoints in my junior and high school English classes.  Even the themes, Cain versus Abel, good versus evil, destiny versus free will, seemed so potentially powerful, juicy and deep.  <br />Yet I found myself only mildly immersed in the novel.  The symbolism seemed overdone, the dialogue unnatural, the character development lacking.  A very masculine read, most of the female characters, with the exception of Abra, were either extremely unlikable or underdeveloped.  If Cathy's role as the evil temptress is a nod to Eve in the Bible, it seemed a bit extreme.<br />To be honest, the story does weave the themes throughout the story in an interesting way.  Steinbeck's descriptive narrative can be beautiful, but can also be a bit long winded.  Sam Hamilton, the wise, bumbling lover of words and dreams, and Lee, the Trask family servant and subtle family advisor, were interesting characters. <br />At times, I felt that Steinbeck was looking for opportunities to brag about his ancestry and these side bars were not always of much value in the long saga.  <br />In a nutshell, I felt reading this book was an accomplishment, one that brought relief when it was over.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Iron Maiden Rules! After Brave New world, this album does'nt do justice to the fans. B+
B00009W0U4|1.0|Exploitation-flick that lives up to every nerd's fantasy of rape and psychotic revenge.  Is the film horrifying?  Yes and no:  yes, in that its scenes of violence are staged with sickening realism; no, if you keep in mind what Noe's up to, here.  Not since Kubrick's  *A Clockwork Orange*  has a film tried so hard to pass off its leering, drooling sadism as  &quot;art&quot;.  Wiser heads will see through this nonsense, dismiss it, and move on; others  (perhaps I should say  &quot;most&quot;)  will be overwhelmed by  *Irreversible*  and call it a masterpiece.  Aside from the violence -- which is supposed to be good for us  (&quot;realistic&quot;, and all that) -- it's hard to see why some would think this movie's great.  At least  *A Clockwork Orange*  had Kubrick, who knew how to frame a shot, for Pete's sake.  Noe prefers handhelds -- also more  &quot;realistic&quot; . . . and dreadfully uncinematic.  The movie should've been called  *Unwatchable*, because it literally is unwatchable:  jiggity-joggity camerawork in the dark.  (Though Noe is generous enough to give us good views of the nasty scenes, natch.)  And if it rips off  *A Clockwork Orange*  spiritually, it rips off  *Memento*  quite literally, with its reverse-order plot.  But never mind that.  It's the pandering to our basest, most rubbernecking instincts that condemns  *Irreversible*  to the ashbin of cinematic history.  Some have said that this movie  &quot;indicts&quot;  violence -- bullhockey!  If anything is  &quot;indicted&quot;  by this film, it's the film's own fan club.
0767802470|4.0|I rated this 4 stars because of the length not the content. I am a great fan of war stories and this one is it compared to talking to a live person.  You can't help but feel everything these brave men are feeling as they try to do their duty to their nation in this terrible war and the conflict that comes up when common sense and orders colide.  The hard decisions and suspense of the Captain and anguish of the men as the U-boat is being depth charged. I found it best viewed in German with English subtitles as you will notice after while you won't need them.   Although it is a long movie it is still an excellent and very worthy viewing time for war movie fans and other interested people as well.  The other version that is shorter is also excellent and very worthwile.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|The bottom line is that Iron Maiden in their 25 year career have always been over 90% based on Steve Harris. He has written the greatest heavy metal/rock songs of all time.One of the most exciting things about a new Maiden album in the past was hearing his new epics for the first time. So it's very sad that since Bruce and Adrian rejoined the band in 1999 instead of Blaze(a management decision), Harris is obviously not that interested. On \\"Brave New World\\" he wrote one number \\"Blood Brothers\\" and on this new cd again just the one - \\"No more lies\\". As for Adrian - 4 songs this time - can anyone remember one good song on the \\"Psycho Motel\\" or \\"ASAP\\" cds? The production - I know Martin Birch has retired but Kevin Shirley - leave it out! Why didn't they get Roy Z? Anyway it is Maiden,and they have tried hard, so until the new JUDAS PRIEST cd, this is what you get! Harris - solo cd coming soon?
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Typically as bands grow old, the quality of their music tends to begin a downward slope.  Many people wrote Maiden off from the very beginning, and yet again as the band recieved mix success for their mid nineties albums, The X Factor and Virtual XI.  Brave New World, was indeed a true return to form with Adrian and Bruce reunited with 'Arry and the boys.  Now the release of the much anticipated Dance Of Death.  As with every single album this band has ever released, Dance Of Death has that classic Maiden sound, that has remained constant since the bands inception.  Riffs, melody, and sheer brilliance.  Bruce's vocals have not waivered once and they are as strong as ever here.  The first single of the album Wildest Dreams, gets the album starting, this indeed classic Maiden.  Four minutes of catchiness and a chorus that just doesn't leave the mind for days.  Other standout tracks on the album are No More Lies, a Steve Harris penned track that truly shows his amazing song writing ability and especially gives Bruce the spotlight with some of the best vocals he's ever laid on tape.  By far, the best track of the album is Adrian Smith's Paschendale.  This song is unbelievable, and gives the guitarist possibly the best song he's ever contributed to the Maiden machine.  All in all, if you enjoyed 2000's Brave New World, this album is all of that and more.  Great singles, and epic 8-9 minute tracks, all that has made Iron Maiden true metal heroes is all here.  Dance Of Death is destined to become another classic album by six guys who deserve much more recognition than America has ever given them.  Up The Irons!
0792164903|1.0|I like Tim Burton's movies. So, when I heard he was making a movie called &quot;Sleepy Hollow,&quot; I was very excited since my favorite story of all time is &quot;The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow.&quot; However, when I saw the movie, I was disgusted with what Mr. Burton did. He took characters from my favorite story...a classic of American literature...and put them in a glorified slasher movie. It had nothing to do with Washington Irving's famous story! If Tim Burton wanted to make a horror film, why couldn't he come up with something original like he has in his other films? Better yet, he could've made a faithful adaptation of the original story! <BR>What upsets me the most is that some people, after seeing this film, will then expect to find a &quot;horror&quot; story if they read the original story, only to be &quot;disappointed&quot; to find that its actually just a good natured, old-fashioned ghost story. Believe me, reading &quot;The Legend Of Sleepy Hollow&quot; by Washington Irving is a much better experience than sitting through this film!
B000069AUI|5.0|Cold Play is the best right now, Mexican concerts are diferent before cold play be here.
B00005JLD4|5.0|Hullo,<br />I am from Western Australia where this film is set and was filmed. This was and is a very strong and poignant film. I used to as a small child stay on a farm in the area the film was created and the farmer had young Aboriginals working and staying on his farm and it never struck me that they had been taken from their parents by force and then be instructed in the ways of the white fella, I was too young then at ten and this was my first incident of even seeing an Aboriginal.<BR>The topic of the film or its contents were never discussed at home or at school so we never really got to know the history of the Aboriginal but fortunately all this has now changed and we live in more enlightened times or so we are led to believe.<BR>There are more movies down here in Australia that deals with the Aboriginal topic so I hope this is not the only movie that makes it to the States.<BR>I watch this movie over and over and never tire of it and the young girls determination to get back to their mothers and their homes and to do it all over again is incredible because if you have seen the bush and desert where the girls had to trek through someone like me would never make the first 20 miles due to my cushioned life. Do yourself a favour and buy it you won't be sorry.<BR>Ben<br />Yes Yes I know you shouldn't vote for yourself but I want people to watch this movie so if one sees a recomendation than that may be the edge for someone to view the movie.<BR>My apologies.Ben
0060012218|5.0|I ordered this a few weeks ago and when I got it yesterday it took me only a few hours to finish, it really was that good and I could not seem to put it down. Though things -do- settle a little too well at the end of the book, the ending is great. I love the characters in the story, they are very well done, and the book really does portray gay teen life as it is. This is an excellent book and I really hope you enjoy it like I did!
B000099T2L|3.0|Decent album...does anyone know which Chi-Lites song is sampled for the horns in Crazy in Love?  Thanks for the help.
B00009V7PJ|5.0|I saw this concert in person and was absolutely blown away. There is no other artist on this planet who can put on as amazing of a concert as Cher. Watching is like watching Cirque du Soliel mixed with an ultra-vibrant, flamboyantly amazing Broadway show topped of with all the glitz and glam of the Cher universe. In this concert, Cher mostly sings her greatest hits. She changes sets and costumes (and wigs, and jewelry, and shoes) almost every song, creating a neverending and fascinating visual experience. Cher looks amazing, and to put it simply... she rocked everyone in that audience and will rock everyone who watches the DVD. There's nothing quite like Cher so you'll have to see it to believe it. Granted, this DVD isn't like being in the audience, but it's definitely a must-see. Even if you're not the biggest fan of her music, you'll be absolutely amazed at the spectacularness and visual quality of her sets and costumes and background dancers and singers, who are very much a part of her show as well. An absolutely amazing experience. I only have one warning: If you ever plan on going to a non-Cher concert and intend to have an amazing time, then don't watch this concert! Cher's concert is so incredible that it will probably spoil any other concert you might ever see. Nothing and nobody will ever live up to Cher- as she herself proudly proclaims. This may be Cher's last tour, but she most certainly will live forever! \\"Follow this, you ------s!\\"
B00006JJ1O|5.0|okay-don't listen to all those people that are saying its bad. ITS NOT. its one of my favorite CDs ever. if you like the first two singles \\"All the things she said\\" and \\"Not gonna get us\\" YOU WILL LOVE the CD. at first i was VERY hesitant about buying it, then decided, \\"you know what, i'm just gonna go for it\\" and when i played it, i was soooo surprised!! every single song on the CD is so good! i coulnd't beleive it! the only other CD i listened to that had all the songs on it were really good was Evanescence. please, don't listen to the others that say \\"they suck, they're gay\\" they may be lesbian, but that don't mean they can't make good music.<br />1. Not gonna get us 10/10: so good, i hooked my friends with this one, very good hook!<BR>2. All the things she said 10/10: such a good song! good 1st single, gets kinda old after 20 listens...<BR>3. Show me love 11/10: THE BEST SONG IN THE WORLD!!!

How soon is now? 10/10 THIS IS MY OTHER FAVORITE SONG...GREAT GUITAR, AND GIVES OFF SUCH A GOOD VIBE!! LOVE IT LOVE IT!<BR>6. Clowns (can you see me now?) 9/10: this song is pretty good, have to say my least favorite thought, most of the time i skip it<BR>7. Malchik gay 10/10: dang, this is another one of my favorite songs, i love it! it'll get stuck in your head all day!!! love it<BR>8. Stars 9/10: this song is really good, if anything, it'll make you laugh because when they rap in russian (sorry to say) it sounds so funny! thats the only reason i like the song, but it really set me off laughin the first time i heard it...lol<BR>9 & 10 are the russain versions of \\"not gonna get us\\" and \\"all the things she said\\", can't really give them a rating cuz they're in russian, but they're okay, i don't listen to them cuz i don't know what the hell they're saying...lol<BR>11.

0071373586|4.0|Jack Trout is a very good writer and has important insights about the importance of differentiation. I especially liked this book as the cases are very relevant.  <BR>But many ideas are getting a bit dated. That being said, if you haven't read anything by Jack Trout or Al Ries then this book, or one of the aforementioned books, is essential reading for marketing and brand managers. An updated book would be High Intensity Marketing by Idris Mootee, an ex-Mckinsey guy. I also like George Day, the Wharton professor who wrote a few good books in postioning.
B00002Z88D|5.0|Many bands have flopped when they tried to combine rock or metal with an orchestra.<br />This onee is different.<br />First of all: it's a compilation and live album in one (+ a new song). So what else can you want?<br />Second: hats off to the San Francisco Orchestra-they have done wonders to combine their violins with the distorted guitars of metal's most famous band.<br />The songs sound amazing, no question aboiut it-just listen to Master of Puppets and you will see. The orchestra sounds louder than the metal kings. Songs such as Call of Ktulu, Battery and Nothing else matter are just a whole lot different when you add the classical instruments.<br />The whole album would be worth buying even if hte only good song was one-&quot;Hero of the day&quot;. THE song of Load has never been better. Period.<br />This album rates right up there with MoP and AJFA as the best MEtallica have ever produced.<br />Before i finish, I should tell you that you should take into account that you get a new song as well-No leaf Clover. Althouhg not amongst the best Metallica have produced, you will surely not program your CD player to skip it.<br />So finally: even if you own all Metallica albums (like me) you should still go out and buy it! No mediocre metal-guaranteed!
B00005JLSE|1.0|This movie narrowly beat out &quot;About Schmidt&quot; for the poorest excuse for entertainment I have experienced this year.  Cynicism and satire have saturated Hollywood and a sane person can only take so much.  The costumes and choreography were not bad, but the acting and singing were sub-par (save for Queen Latifah's sterling performance).  Obviously, I am in the minority for disliking this movie, but it was just not my cup of tea.  In the future I will use a little more discretion in renting moview that the critics and the Academy rave over.
B00005J4HH|4.0|OOS is the best of alternative rockers Muse. <BR>Much compared to Radiohead, this record delivers more rock and explores more sinister sides of life.<BR>Packed with distorted guitar, excellent piano (believe me, those parts are hard to play-as I found out when I tried to cover Nwborn) and Matt's amazing array of vocalic armament.<BR>The highlights of the album are NEWBORn and BLISS which are real hard rocking, alternative music of class.<BR>If you want a song which is loud, but doesn't feature the heavy, philosophical lyrics of Muse, try for PLUG-IN BABY. Or if you want a Queen-like song go for SPACE DEMENTIA-a strange venture into spacey, bizarre terittory which surprises with its originality.<BR>Listening to this album reminded me of Pink Floyd's best moments-mainly because of the mysterious, Niestche lyrics and the pounding bass. Of course comparing Muse to the legendary band might sound like an overstatement but buy the CD and you should see (read-hear) for yourself!
B00005J9ZB|5.0|Sooner or later I had to get to Ayreon<br />Should any of my readers not know who Ayreon is, let me edify you. Ayreon is not a band, not really. Neither is Ambeon. Let me explain. Ayreon and Ambeon are projects, you might say alter egos of brilliant Dutch composer and musician, Arjen Anthony Luccassen.<br />You see, Arjen has borrowed one from the book of the ever successful recording broker, Alan Parsons. He composes a Rock Opera and then like the mice followed the Pied Piper into the river, several well known, at least to me, guest singers and musicians follow our piperish leader, Arjen, into the studio to record, this wonderful music.<br />Now Arjen hasn't used this successful formula once or twice. No he's made eight exciting albums this way, two of which are double albums. Mind you now, I understand there's a waiting list to be in Arjen's next production.<br />I can see why, it must be fun, mingling with other very talented people and making this remarkably interesting and different music. It's probably like, if I may regress to seventies terms, a &quot;happening&quot;. And how different it is!<br />Into the Electric Castle, as do all of Arjen's projects, tells a story and in this case it is a science fiction story centered around eight strangers brought together into a dimension of no space and no time. It seems, if Luccassen ever decides to hang up his guitar he could make a living writing sci-fi.<br />Here is a summary of the story from Ayreon's Website:<br />&quot;'Into the Electric Castle' tells the story of 8 stereotypical characters from different periods of time who suddenly find themselves in another dimension. A Highlander, Knight, Egyptian, Indian, Barbarian, Roman, Hippie and Futureman each try to understand where they are and what they are supposed to do. It is then that a voice rings out from the sky to tell them that the dimension they have arrived in is built on dreams and fears. In order to find their way back to their own dimension and time, they must go in search of The Electric Castle. During the search every character is forced to confront his or her innermost fears, and not everyone survives the treacherous journey to the Castle.&quot;<br />&quot;At the end of the journey those that successfully dealt with their personal demons find out that the voice belongs to an alien named 'Forever of the Stars', a member of an alien race living in a distant galaxy. These aliens created planet Earth and its people as an experiment so they could study, and hopefully one day experience emotions, as they themselves lost feelings eons ago.&quot;<br />&quot;'Into the Electric Castle' is a double CD. On disc 1 we experience the journey to The Electric Castle and on disc 2 we find out what happens when they arrive there.&quot;<br />Haven't I read something by Stephen King like that. Yeah, I know, the plot is pretty ch-e-e-ze ball but honestly the music is fabulous, here are some highlights:<br />&quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; is an eleven minute multi-part song.<br />&quot;Let the Journey Begin&quot; is the first part with Highlander and Indian singing in what is an ethereal, almost Moody Blues part. &quot;The halls of Isis and Osiris&quot; is sung by Roman and Egyptian as the pace picks up nicely with a choppy orchestral beat plus a sitar and guitar solo. &quot;Strange Constellations / Reprise&quot; the third and forth parts narrated by Highlander (Fish) with an atmospheric background and some remarkable guitar and keyboard work. This is an amazing piece of work that I could use a thousand words describing.<br />&quot;The Decision Tree (we're alive)&quot; sung by Barbarian and Highland, with all joining in on the chorus's.

B00006LLNV|5.0|While this award winning score exists on one level in a symbiotic relationship with the film (also HIGHLY recommended), this album stands on it's own beautifully. In fact, it was the album that brought me to the movie! And while much of the music is very evocative of its subject, it also has an arc of its own. I find it difficult to skip songs while listening, although I am still (after many months) mesmerized by &quot;Burn It Blue&quot;, sung by the incomparable Caetano Veloso (with Lila Downs). What makes this album magnificent for me is it's repetitive appeal, combined with it's ability to lead me to other places...next stop for me: the other  film music of (the prodigious and brilliant) Elliot Goldenthal, and more Caetano Veloso! BUY this CD...you'll LOVE it!!!
B0000256RB|5.0|Sooner or later I had to get to Ayreon<br />Should any of my readers not know who Ayreon is, let me edify you. Ayreon is not a band, not really. Neither is Ambeon. Let me explain. Ayreon and Ambeon are projects, you might say alter egos of brilliant Dutch composer and musician, Arjen Anthony Luccassen.<br />You see, Arjen has borrowed one from the book of the ever successful recording broker, Alan Parsons. He composes a Rock Opera and then like the mice followed the Pied Piper into the river, several well known, at least to me, guest singers and musicians follow our piperish leader, Arjen, into the studio to record, this wonderful music.<br />Now Arjen hasn't used this successful formula once or twice. No he's made eight exciting albums this way, two of which are double albums. Mind you now, I understand there's a waiting list to be in Arjen's next production.<br />I can see why, it must be fun, mingling with other very talented people and making this remarkably interesting and different music. It's probably like, if I may regress to seventies terms, a &quot;happening&quot;. And how different it is!<br />Into the Electric Castle, as do all of Arjen's projects, tells a story and in this case it is a science fiction story centered around eight strangers brought together into a dimension of no space and no time. It seems, if Luccassen ever decides to hang up his guitar he could make a living writing sci-fi.<br />Here is a summary of the story from Ayreon's Website:<br />&quot;'Into the Electric Castle' tells the story of 8 stereotypical characters from different periods of time who suddenly find themselves in another dimension. A Highlander, Knight, Egyptian, Indian, Barbarian, Roman, Hippie and Futureman each try to understand where they are and what they are supposed to do. It is then that a voice rings out from the sky to tell them that the dimension they have arrived in is built on dreams and fears. In order to find their way back to their own dimension and time, they must go in search of The Electric Castle. During the search every character is forced to confront his or her innermost fears, and not everyone survives the treacherous journey to the Castle.&quot;<br />&quot;At the end of the journey those that successfully dealt with their personal demons find out that the voice belongs to an alien named 'Forever of the Stars', a member of an alien race living in a distant galaxy. These aliens created planet Earth and its people as an experiment so they could study, and hopefully one day experience emotions, as they themselves lost feelings eons ago.&quot;<br />&quot;'Into the Electric Castle' is a double CD. On disc 1 we experience the journey to The Electric Castle and on disc 2 we find out what happens when they arrive there.&quot;<br />Haven't I read something by Stephen King like that. Yeah, I know, the plot is pretty ch-e-e-ze ball but honestly the music is fabulous, here are some highlights:<br />&quot;Isis and Osiris&quot; is an eleven minute multi-part song.<br />&quot;Let the Journey Begin&quot; is the first part with Highlander and Indian singing in what is an ethereal, almost Moody Blues part. &quot;The halls of Isis and Osiris&quot; is sung by Roman and Egyptian as the pace picks up nicely with a choppy orchestral beat plus a sitar and guitar solo. &quot;Strange Constellations / Reprise&quot; the third and forth parts narrated by Highlander (Fish) with an atmospheric background and some remarkable guitar and keyboard work. This is an amazing piece of work that I could use a thousand words describing.<br />&quot;The Decision Tree (we're alive)&quot; sung by Barbarian and Highland, with all joining in on the chorus's. It is a medium slow very catchy song with lots of organs and synths.<br />&quot;Across the Rainbow Bridge&quot; sung by Knight, Roman and Hippie. Opens with acoustic then switches back and forth to electric while keyboards in background to a varied pace. At three+ minutes it changes with a chugging beatat a medium fast pace. really great song.<br />&quot;the Garden of Emotions&quot; is a ten minute multi-part song that opens Disc 2. &quot;In the Garden of Emotions&quot; sung by Hippie (actually spoken through a distorter of some sort) and Egyptian slowly and atmospheric. &quot;Voices in the Sky&quot; picks up with a heavy crunchy beat and some very nifty organ / synth work. sung by Barbarian, Roman and Indian. &quot;The Agression Factor&quot; is sung by Futureman , Knight and Indian and is a mix of the first two parts<br />&quot;The Castle Hall&quot; sung by Knight and Barbarian, starts out with some very deep heavy guitar work and ominous singing before mellowing out at a medium tempo.

B00006BTCA|5.0|Hey folks.  I was turned onto this record by accident.  First Amazon shrewdly pointed me in the direction of Interpol because of an earlier purchase.  I read the reviews and gave it a shot. I'm really glad I did.  Earlier reviewers mentioned Joy Division and The Chameleons UK and while I can live with those comparisions this CD shouted Television as far as I'm concerned. I'm probably older than most folks at 43 who bought this record, but if anyone out there can remember Marquee Moon this record will not disappoint.  For perspective sake, I'm a moron with 3000 CD's in my collection so even though I buy way too much music, I know a thing or two about the difference between good records and bad records.  I'm big fan of Joy Division and The Chameleons so I understand the earlier reveiewer who couldn't quite put an exact match to this CD, but if you like all three of these bands you will like this.  I promise.  I don't care about copy catting really, there has always been a place for this kind of dark goth genre.  I hope this convinces somebody to take a chance on this CD because there is so much garbage out there it's really important to support the bands that get it.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Bought this the day if came out, listened to it on my way home and proceeded to be blown away.  It's been three years since Brave New World and it was more than worth the wait.  It knocked BNW away and is now in my top 5 favorite Maiden cds.   This is Brave New World on steriods.   There are two songs on here that are weaker than the rest but they are still good (listening to one of those said two songs as I type this review), just my least favs on the album though. I won't say which two but that doesn't matter, we all have our own opinions.  <br />First of all, the production is amazing.  From the same dude that did BNW and it also features steve harris returning to co produce.  Like BNW, the album sounds live and chock full of energy.  It tends to be faster than BNW and heavier too.  There are several epic songs on here and chock full of guitar solos.  While Maiden have used keyboards a few times on a couple albums, they use them big time here and it comes out extremely well.  Nothing corny or bombastic, just something to fill your ears and it makes the songs even more huge and progressive than they already are.  Of course this is maiden, so there are also a few fast, catchy, songs around the epics and they rule.  <br />Steve's bass is once again kicking some serious butt and it's a lot more audible than it was on BNW.  The riffs are solid and they are usually more heavy than anything Maiden have done in the past.  Bruce's voice is in top notch, it's gotten a lot better since BNW.Nicko is once again showning how good of a drummer he is and there is a lot of double bass on this album, probably the most they have ever used.  This is the second cd since the return of smith and bruce and it seems they are all used to playing again better than they were on BNW.  The lyrics are top notch.  <br />Also, track 11 is an acoustic song, first ever for Iron Maiden if I recall correctly.  Trust me when I say this song is amazing, one of the best on the album and possibly theircareer as well.  What a great way to finish the album of the year.<br />Problems?  Just one.  In a couple songs, the chorus consists of just one or two lines that are repeated too many times in a role and its called a chorus.  No biggie since the chorus in those songs are only repeated twice or so but it can get annoying (yes, these are the songs I said were weaker above.  weakER, not weak, i still like them).<br />All in all, not the best Iron Maiden album (that honor goes to 7th son or powerslave) but it's one of their best and the cd of the year, without question or any doubt in my metal mind.  <br />Thank you Iron Maiden for making some of the best music I've ever heard and for not sucking so late in your career, unlike a lot of other bands.<br />UP THE IRONS!
B000003N8R|4.0|I like all the tracks on this one with the exception of &quot;Bessie's Blues&quot; which really doesn't fit in here...  This is the last &quot;straight ahead&quot; Coltrane album before things turn in a more experimental direction...
B00008J4P5|2.0|I listened to this album, not really sure what to expect. I've heard the ravings about the White Stripes, but this was my first proper experience of them.<br />After overcoming my initial revulsion to the very raw sound, I decided that it was very cool as a concept album, a tamely rebellious statement against the music industry and society. The lyrics are interesting, &quot;There's no home for you here, girl, go away&quot;, and so is the CD cover. And some of the tracks have quite an infectious energy like Seven Nation Army and Black Math, and Button to Button, and there is some quite innovative guitar work. But coupled with very loose drumming, and no bass guitar, the overall of listening to the whole CD is to make you feel ill.<br />I don't know why they pride themselves on using technology that predates the Beatles and no computers, but I guess it goes with the image they're trying to cultivate. Admittedly I far prefer well-produced music - garage is not really my style. <br />In my personal opinion, the music is poor-quality, and posey. That said I'm sure there's a good reason for its existence, but I'm not going to jump on the bandwagon and buy it. In short, if my band ever produced a sound like theirs, we'd quickly flee back to the practice room for extensive rehearsing to make ourselves actually sound good. There's a reason it only took them 2 weeks to record this album.<br />I haven't found many reviews with negative opinions of this band, so that's why I'm writing this.
B00005JLTN|2.0|This movie wasn't very good.  The creativity and originality (not to mention the thought provoking story) of the first movie were followed here by a poorly written, poorly acted, poorly consieved sequal that simply brings more of the same.  Personally, I was dying to see this movie, barely able to contain myself: I really wanted to see what crazy powers Neo was going to have.  He has no new powers though, it seems, in fact, that the creators were at a loss with what to do with Neo in this film.  Most of the movie is slow moving, boring, stupid, and tries to cram some ridiculous philosophy down your throat.  Where the first movie assumed a smart audience, this movie assumes a gulible one.  It's not that the ideas aren't sophisticaed, it's that they are being served to me to cleanly.  The story lacks drive (since it's about the inablity of characters to make choices) and even the action scenes are lacking, as you never really learn to care about the characters.  I rate this a 2 out of 5 because the car chase was incredible (there's a good plot duing it,  and I found myself genuinely wishing to see the chracters escape.  All and all though, this movie is worth skipping: my imagination of what it would be was at least 10 times as good as the movie itself.
B0000BYM3K|1.0|terrible album........ is a album of nascent ......<BR>What happen maiden?
0316666343|5.0|This book is haunting. I hesistate to use that word, &quot;haunting&quot;, because so many people interpret it in a negative way. That's not how I wish to use it in this case. What I mean by saying that this book haunts you is that it's characters stay with you. And when I finished the book, I found myself mourning the characters as though I had lost someone I knew. And yet, when I put it into perspective this book is just about life. These people, these characters, just trying to get through life and all it's complexities. Sebold does an incredible job creating this story and in the end manages to pull it all together with an unexpected happy ending.
B00005JKHN|3.0|The Blu-ray is indescribable. Seen on a 60\\" plasma display, it's jaw-dropping. I saw the film theatrically more than 50 years ago, and the Blu-ray easily outclasses the Technicolor print. You finally /understand/ what Disney was trying to do, visually. As for the movie itself...<br /><br />There is one truly great scene in \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" -- a scene, in fact, unique in all of Disney feature animation. Maleficent taunts the chained Prince Philip with the fear of growing old and ugly, while the sleeping Aurora remains young and beautiful, by showing him what will occur when she sets him free -- a hundred years from now. He sees himself as a decrepit old man with long white hair and beard, astride a horse destined for the glue factory.<br /><br />\\"A wondrous future lies before you. You -- the destined hero of a charming fairy tale come true. Behold -- King Stephan's castle. And in yonder topmost tower, dreaming of her true love, the Princess Aurora... She is indeed most wondrous fair -- gold of sunshine in her hair -- lips that shame the red, red rose -- in ageless sleep she finds repose. The years roll by -- but a hundred years, to a steadfast heart, are but a day. And now, the gates of the dungeon part, and our prince is free to go his way. Off he rides, on his noble stead, a valiant figure, straight and tall, to wake his love, with love's first kiss, and prove that [extreme sarcasm] true love conquers all.\\" [mean-spirited laughter]<br /><br />Now, I happen to _like_ bearded geezers, and (for me) Philip (who, when upset  or angry, looks a lot like Harrison Ford) is far more attractive in his old age. But Maleficent \\"shoves in the knife\\" by suggesting to Philip that, though he will not have changed inwardly, Aurora will nevertheless find him a repulsive old man. So much for \\"love.\\"<br /><br />This sequence grabs the romantic notions of physical attraction, love at first sight, and \\"happily ever after\\" by their figurative necks and rubs their faces in pig manure. It's marvelously cruel, even ugly, adding a nasty moment to a film that would benefit from a darker tone.<br /><br />As generally disappointing a movie as \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is, there _are_ some good things about it. Eleanor Audley's Maleficent is superb. Her malice is subtle -- she rants and raves only when driven to extremes. Audley brings a world-weariness to Maleficent only hinted at in the script, but which immensely deepens the character. Disney animated features have always had terrific character acting, but Audley's performance is primus inter pares. It's no wonder that Maleficent has never lost her place as everyone's favorite Disney villainess.<br /><br />The animation is also superb. Human characters move naturally and fluidly, with believable weight -- the scene in which Philip and Aurora dance by the lake is remarkable. Philip's horse (note that \\"Philip\\" comes from Greek words meaning \\"horse lover\\") moves much like a real horse, with little caricature. Note also how fabrics (especially the fairies' and Maleficent's costumes) swirl and bounce with the proper inertia.<br /><br />Eyvind Earle's magnificent production design needs no more praise than has already been lavished on it. It's pretty much the only reason \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" is of any lasting interest.<br /><br />The frame-by-frame digital restoration was produced in the mid-'90s for a VHS and laserdisk release. It looks nothing short of incredible on DVD. I saw \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" during its initial run, and the DVD simply blows away the theatrical presentation. It'll knock your eyes out. My only complaint is that saturated colors - fabrics, a bird's plumage -- are simply too vivid for the otherwise subdued color palette.<br /><br />The supplemental material is lavish, including two complete Disneyland shows, one a G-rated biography of Tchaikovsky, and the other about how four Disney artists \\"interpret\\" a tree. The artwork gallery is, however, disappointingly skimpy.<br /><br />The commentary (running and otherwise) is terrific. It actually acknowledges and discusses the film's shortcomings, a first for Disney home video. The funniest moment occurs when the ever-optimistic Mary Costa opines that Disney and Tchaikovsky would have enjoyed working together. Richard Schickel is the only Disney biographer to accuse Uncle Walt of being homophobic, but I really doubt Walter and Peter would have found much of a basis for a relationship (even professional), if only because Tchaikovsky was a moody and profoundly unhappy person.<br /><br />I'm sorry I can't give \\"Sleeping Beauty\\" more than a three-star (\\"average\\") rating. The incredible artwork and outstanding animation cannot hide the fact there is no compelling story. It is for good reason that Aurora has long been known as \\"the plastic princess.\\"tcomings, a first for Disney home video.

B00004XPPK|5.0|Much has been made of the obvious pleasures in \\"Gilda\\" -- the stunning, idol-making performance of Rita Hayworth; the famous striptease-that-really-is-a-tease; the overripe dialogue (somebody could make a good drinking game based on how many times somebody says \\"Johnny\\" to Glenn Ford); the perversely sexual subtexts involving Gilda and Johnny, Gilda and Ballin, and certainly, Ballin and Johnny (!)  But the other pleasures of this movie shouldn't be overlooked.  For one thing, it's one of the best LOOKING movies ever to come out of the 1940's:  stunning sets, gorgeous costumes, and most of all, eye-popping black-and-white photography, making effective use of noir conventions (everyone is forever stepping into or out of shadows) and creating Glenn Ford and Rita Hayworth as pinnacles of physical beauty; neither one ever looked this good again, although Rita came close in \\"You Were Never Lovelier\\".<BR>Maybe my favorite overlooked treat in \\"Gilda\\" is the enigmatic character of Uncle Pio, who has some of the best lines in the movie as he wittily comments on the foibles of the characters,<BR>acting as a sort of Shakespearean Fool.  Screenwriting this good is certainly part of what makes \\"Gilda\\" so special and brings its fans back to watch again and again.<br />One final comment: if Rita Hayworth really does her own singing during the quiet version of \\"Mame\\" in the nightclub at 5 a.m., as I've read and heard, the lady was not only gorgeous and a terrific dancer, she had quite a voice, too!

6300215741|5.0|This is another old Hitchcock film, typical of his expert touch, and like virtually all of his work features a cameo appearance of Hitchcock himself.  (A scene on a bus, in which he appears nonchalantly seated alongside Cary Grant as just another passenger for a second or two.)<br /><br />In this wonderful film, Cary Grant plays a former jewel thief, John Robie, an American living in France who helps the French resistance during WWII, and subsequently (after the war) is given a parole for his former criminal acts because of his wartime heroism, dependent upon his subsequent good behavior, and \\"goes straight.\\"<br /><br />But there is a problem:  Someone, using his exact modus operandi, begins a series of heists--throwing him into an extremely had light with the local gendarme.<br /><br />Grace Kelly, as Frances Stevens, a somewhat spoiled American heiress, guesses his actual identity when he is trying to remain in hiding undercover in order to discover the perpetrator, and the plot thickens.<br /><br />In the unlikely event that you have not seen this film, I don't wish to spoil it for you, so I'll not divulge any more of the plot, but it is HItchcock's usual masterful job, superbly played by a couple of Hollywood's top superstars when they were at the height of their careers.<br /><br />This film was released in VHS on April 1, 2003.  It is one of those timeless movies that never gets tiresome.  A true classic representing a time when actors and actresses actually had character, and were identifiable as real professionals.  Lord, I miss the \\"old days\\" when titillating the audience with filthy language and sex scenes was not necessary to hold their interest--just good stories and good acting.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre ...
0316096199|5.0|I read &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; by Alice Sebold before &quot;Lucky&quot;.  I absolutely loved her first novel and immediately picked this one up.  Her writing about such awful subjects, such as rape, are so brutally honest and non-apologetic, but she has a way of describing it that doesn't make you feel disgusted or that you just can't read anymore.  She takes you into the depth of it and then pulls you out just before it gets to be too much.  She did this in &quot;Lovely Bones&quot; also, which deals with an even harder topic than this.  During the entire book I felt as if I was listening to a friend and I actually missed her when I finished the book.  I highly recommend this and am looking forward to her future books.  She has definitely become one of my favorite writers.
B00008GKEG|5.0|The Beatles were/are inarguably the most popular and influential rock &amp; roll/pop group in the short history of modern music.  Their influence spanned generations, fashion, film, and culture.  This DVD anthology set illustrates why.  What's good about this presentation is that the Beatles themselves narrate their own history as well as comment on how they influenced the world.  Naturally, they don't go into WHY.  They're rather humble, and they aren't sociologists anyway.  There are only 2 flaws: first is that there is such a lack of post-Beatles Lennon footage -- he did some good TV interviews, and only snippets appear here.  Second is that this could have been an &quot;Exhaustive&quot; collection by presenting ALL the music videos these guys did.  But then perhaps that's the NEXT project on the Apple agenda.  Let's hope so.  I'd love to see their music videos (then called &quot;promo clips&quot; or &quot;promo films&quot;) from '63 thru the mid-70s (the Capitol contract era).

I just kept watching and watching waiting for the &quot;plot&quot; to come out and it never did... TERRIBLE TERRIBLE TERRIBLE. Please for the sake of your self-dignity don't order this TERRIBLY overrated movie... aesthetic ... yeah right!
B000089RVX|5.0|all i can say is WOW!! this is one of the best cds i've bought in a long time everything from the Lyrics to the vocals. this band has somnthing going 4 them its a breath of fresh air to the genere. I highly reccomend this cd you won't be dissapointed.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Has it really been three years since Iron Maiden blew away those who said the Maiden machine was old and rusty, by releasing their brilliant 'reunion' album &quot;Brave New World&quot;??  With Bruce and Adrian  back in the band, hopes were high for a return to the glory days.  &quot;Brave New World&quot; proved that Maiden were still at the top of their game, but could they repeat the success of this album???  Well, three years on, Maiden release &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, and don't sound like they're planning on going anywhere but all the way making the best metal on the planet!  &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is a heavier album than &quot;Brave New World&quot;, indeed it is arguably their heaviest album yet (or at least since 1984's &quot;Powerslave&quot;).  The energy is pure dynamite, with every band member giving 110% to make this a truly rockin' heavy metal album.<br />The band's sound seems to have adjusted more to the three-guitar lineup, which was first featured on &quot;Brave New World&quot;, with the riffs being heavy and still rich and textured.  There is more three-part lead-harmonisation as well, with the 'three amigos' (Dave, Adrian and Janick) playing around each other with incredible ease and comfort.  One of the great things about this album, is that Adrian has contributed more songs and more guitar solos than he did on &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  This is a good thing because Adrian is definately the best riff-writer and rhythm-guitarist in the band, which I think is a main reason for the heavier sound on this album - and his soloing has never sounded better either!   Dave once again effortlessly fills out many songs with his blistering virtuoso solos, further cementing his place in the Metal Guitar God firmament.  And Janick's maturation as a major songwriter in the band is showcased with some great contributions here, and while his trademark messy-shredding is still present in a lot of his lead stuff, he has also contributed several of his best solos ever to this album.  Another new direction for this album is that, aside from the three 8-minute epics (&quot;No More Lies&quot;, &quot;Dance of Death&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot;), which feature three solos each, and the all-acoustic closing track (&quot;Journeyman&quot;), which features no solo, the rest of the songs only feature one solo each (as opposed to the usual two), by whichever guitarist co-wrote the song, which gives Janick 2, Dave 2 and Adrian 3.  Total solos = Adrian 6, Dave 5, Janick 5.  This seems to work as a good way of more-or-less equally accommodating the three brilliant guitarists in the band.  I must say that it would have been nice though to hear an acoustic solo (especially one by Dave!) on &quot;Journeyman&quot;, but you can't have everything!<br />Bruce's vocals are in top form as always, although he does have to work hard sometimes on this album to stand out against the wall of guitar sound.  Harry's playing is brilliant as always, with the pounding bass really adding to the heaviness of the songs.  And Nicko, while being the oldest member of the band, and perhaps having slowed down just the tinyest amount over the years, has still put in a stellar performance and firmly reminded us all why he is still one of the greatest drummers in metal today.  Nicko also had his first song-writing credit on this album, alongside Adrian and Bruce on the classic metal blaster &quot;New Frontier&quot;.  The song writing is mostly collaborative with Bruce and Adrian both contributing more songs, but of course Harry is still the backbone of the band's songwriting - contributing the albums only sole-writer track, &quot;No More Lies&quot;.  The lyrics are the usual mix of history, fiction and existential musings.  The massacre of the Cathars at Montsegur and the WWI battle of Paschendale being two historical inspirations seen on this album (on the tracks, you guessed it, &quot;Montsegur&quot; and &quot;Paschendale&quot;).  So truly, Maiden have returned with yet another stellar album, indeed one of their best yet, further cementing their place as the greatest heavy metal band in history.  <br />Verily they are the Kings of Metal!!  Up the Irons!!!!
B0000AI44Q|4.0|Let's hope that the S/G and Passionate era has passed and Neil is now back to business. I've been a rabid Neil Young fan since I first heard &quot;Southern Man&quot; on the CSNY &quot;4-Way Street&quot; release (the best live album in recording history) 30 years ago. If you thought, as I did, that &quot;Silver and Gold&quot; and &quot;...Passionate&quot; were the two worst albums he ever churned out, then &quot;Greendale&quot; will be a breath of fresh air. <br />It, Greendale, may not be his best work but some of Neil's roots are evident. The R+B country/rock sound that has been his trademark for years and faded away in his past two efforts, is back. Also back is some of his trademark cynical lyrics with some cutting wit and social commentary. <br />In comparison, Greendale doesn't reach the heights of some of his earlier work, but it beats hands down his last two. I was afraid someone was going to have to put Neil to sleep if he turned out any more mind-numbing elevator music. But once again, he's shown that he always has another surprise up his sleeve.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|I heard great things about Iron Maiden's Dance of Death from reading the bands website updates.  People involved in the making of this new Maiden installment were hyping this to be the best work from the band ever.  <br />So on game day, I raced to the local HMV shop and picked up my copy.  My first listen was on my computer at work with headphones and I had NO opinion whatsoever.  I figured that it must have been the subpar environment.  When I got home, I listened to it again on my home stereo.  I'm sad to say that my feelings for this album has not changed much.<br />When Brave New World was released, I was blown away for two reasons.  First, I was glad to have Bruce back.  Second, the album was by far the best Maiden release since Seventh Son.  The songs rocked!  <br />Dance of Death, unfortunatley, had to follow BNW.  If it had been released before BNW, I may have given it a better rating due to the fact that the last few Maiden albums have basically been [fluff].  However, since that did not happen, this will sit in mediocrity forever.<br />Since I feel that the songs on this album, for the most part, are rather repetitive, I'd rather only discuss the true standouts (bad and good)<br />The good:<br />Paschendale - A very good song with great music and it clocks in at almost 8 and a half minutes.  Classic epic Maiden.<br />Journeyman - Now this is very different from what Maiden is known for.  This is much slower and melodic than what I would expect from the band.  But, with that said, we were promised songs that would not fit the standard Maiden mold and I guess we got it.<br />The Bad<br />No More Lies - repeats the phrase \\"No More Lies\\" so many times that it drives me bonkers.  But I'm sure Maiden will turn it into a sing-a-long in concert which might make it tolerable.<br />The Lyrics - who wrote these songs' lyrics and why?  We know the answer to the first question but they could have taken some more time and thought before throwing these together.<br />Bruce's voice - Not sure if it was the production work or not but Bruce's voice sounds either tired or strained.  I know he is getting older but, to me, it sounds like he recorded this at the end of a tour with no time off.<br />Well, I'm sure people here will disagree with me and think that this is the best thing since sliced bread but I've been a Maiden fan for 20 years now and I know what they are capable of doing.  To me, this was not Maiden at their best.  Maybe we need Bruce and Adrian to break apart again and record another stunning solo album like \\"Chemical Wedding\\" before the next Maiden album even becomes a concept.<br />Maybe I'll change my mind after many more listens but at this point, I fear that I may just shelf it for now and throw \\"Somewhere in Time\\" in my CD player to remind me what Maiden can relly do.
B0000AI44Q|2.0|I love Neil Young and Crazy Horse but this album is a collection of unimaginative, mid tempo songs that chug along without purpose.  If you loved &quot;Ragged Glory&quot; save your money.
0375707972|5.0|I've read this book in Polish so literary values of the English translations are not the point of my reflexion.<BR>I just wanted to say - this book will make yours eyes sweat...<BR>It never happened to me while reading. I just could not stop crying.<BR>No great classical novels have ever made me feel this way. This modest book appears in an era when writing a GREAT novel is wirtually impossible. We all know why, and we all agree. Of course - great novels can appear in the context of postmodern American Literature, but they don't necessarily make a great read.<BR>Schlink does it with his modesty and understatement.<BR>And one more thing: THIS BOOK IS NOT ABOUT HOLOCAUST. The author had chosen the Poles to be the victims in this book - please respect it. 3.000.000 Poles (besides another 3.000.000 Jewish citizens of Poland) died from German atrocities during WWII - and  when one uses the word Holocaust it denies them the right to memory.
B00005O3VC|5.0|I could yammer on about the great quotes in this film, and they are legion, but it is much more than that.  Drink in the editing and beautiful cinematography, accomplished on a relative shoestring.  A strange film that immerses you in the 9th century and beats you over the head with the 20th century.  Brilliant throughout, mostly.  Not recommended for lagophobes but a hearty romp for all others.  OK, a few quotes.  &quot;Not the curtains!&quot; and ummm....&quot;I'm not old...I'm thirty-seven..&quot;.  I'd include more quotes but I'd probably die while carving them.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|i have to say right off the bat that this album was well worth the wait. I also have to say that the more i listen to it the more it grows on me! some of the songs are maiden at their finest (ala PASCHENDALE, DANCE OF DEATH (title track), and RAINMAKER my fav from the album). However there are filler songs that could have been b sides.... it seems in certain songs like GATES OF TOMOROW that they were trying a little too hard and were less inspired songs than the preceding album BRAVE NEW WORLD where just about every song had a fresh classic sound to it... don't get me wrong though! most of the songs on this album are pretty darn good and are worth the price of the cd alone. up the irons!!!
B000066C1N|5.0|i see what they did.  they made the movie to be bought for the kids then they used bryan adams to make the soundtrack, knowing that most of the parents of the kids who enjoyed the movie grew up listening to him would love the music.  they were right.  it worked. the soundtrack is great.  it also gives poor mom something else to listen to in the car instead of the &quot;wheels on the bus go round and round&quot; or &quot;pop goes the weasal&quot;<br />seriously, the soundtrack is fabulous.  true brayn adams.
0156027321|4.0|I found life of Pi to be one of the most interesting books I have ever read.  Description usually bothers me and I like to skip over it but in this book I read every word.  I loved the humour over the various religions Although I read a lot of books it is for pleasure and I do not like having to guess or ponder what the author really had in mind.  I am really perplexed at the ending and the two different story explanations. I have discussed this with different people and they are confused also.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|amazing amzing cd probably their longest too 68 minutes and 8 seconds of pure metal...its tied for the best in my opinion.
B00005JKZV|3.0|First let me say that those involved in bringing these books to the screen have a monumental task, and are doing a fairly good job in representation.<br />I know poetic license is often taken in such aspects, and as for missing some of the story, that just happens.  How in the world do you put a full novel on the screen.  That being said, there is one aspect to TTT that really got my goat.<br />WHY CHANGE THE COMPLETE PORTRAYAL OF AN IMPORTANT CHARACTER!  I of course refer to the screen version of Faramir.  In the book, you are given a glimpse of what the Fellowship of the ring would have been if the &quot;right&quot; son had been set to the task, rather than the &quot;rightful&quot; son.  Faramir of the book was pure in spirit, where Boromir was flawed.  There was no quest for glory, no kidnapping, no sudden epiphany.  Faramir knew, as soon as he realized who Frodo was, what needed to be done.  Purest? You have to draw the line somewhere.<br />Other things also bothered me a bit in the sense that there is so much material from the books to use, why create new scenes.
0613371895|5.0|This book is awesome.  I loved it as a child, and I love it now as an adult.  This is definitely a must-read.
B00005JKHN|5.0|Sleeping Beauty stands as Disney's most visually stunning creation-filmed in 70mm and with designs by Eyvind Earle that combined modern design with the gothic stylings of the 14th Century. Paired with a score adapted from Tchaikovsky's Sleeping Beauty ballet and excellent vocal perfomances, the film is fondly remembered by many.<br />The film itself draws more from the Brothers Grimm version of the tale as the Perrault version that inspired Tchaikovsky, but the score is perfectly appropriate. Maleficent, perhaps the greatest of the Disney villains, has crashed the party celebrating the birth of Princess Aurora, and curses the child to die on her 16th birthday, when she will prick her finger on a spinning wheel. The curse is partially negated by one of the three fairies who had come to bless the princess, and Aurora will instead fall into a deathless slumber, only to be awoken by true love's first kiss. The fairies decide to raise Aurora in secrecy until her 16th birthday, but Maleficent finds her the day before her 16th birthday, and manages to set the curse in motion, leaving Aurora's betrothed, Prince Philip, to awaken her.<br />The DVD is presented in widescreen and fullscreen formats, although watching the film in anything less than widescreen is a travesty. The film has been spectacularly restored, from the same process that was used to excellently restore Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs. The special features are expansive, and are, quite frankly, akin to the Platinum Editions that Snow White and Beauty and the Beast have received the past two years (and that The Lion King is geting next month). Therefore, this 2-disc set is simply not to be missed.
B000089RVX|4.0|I've been amazed with this group ever since the Daredevil soundtrack made &quot;Bring me to life&quot; so popular.  The balance between hard-hitting guitar / intrumentals and beautiful vocals is unbelievable.<BR>Unfortunately, the originality ends there and most of the album tends to sound somewhat repetitive.  I would still highly recommend this album for people who are looking for some new rock.
B00006FDCD|2.0|The makers of this televised version of Stephen King's bestseller did a remarkable job editing the 1000+ page book down to a &quot;trim&quot; 4 hours. They managed to keep a good number of scenes intact, and it seems clear that what changes they did make were done with the best intentions in order to simplify the story. Unfortunately, somewhere along the way, the heart of King's story was lost. In book form, &quot;It&quot; is a story about the wonders of childhood: the pure love of childhood friends, the fears of an unknown world (and the unknowns in the known world), and the simple belief that good will conquer evil-- all things that are lost as we cross the threshold into adulthood (except, perhaps, the fear of the unknown). &quot;It&quot; is also a story about adults rediscovering the magic of being a child, and coming to understand what true friendship really is. Sadly, these themes are missing from the movie version. In an effort to get the story right, the moviemakers left little time for the type of character development and elaboration on those themes that make King's novel a hallmark of horror writing. And the story falls flat without those two things. Tim Curry is indeed frightening as Pennywise, but not nearly as frightening as the It that grows in the reader's imagination while the book is read. Watching the movie, the viewer is given too many glimpses of the clown and his mouthful of fangs, and quickly becomes desensetized to Curry's portrayal of evil incarnate. Worse, no explanation is given for many of the things Pennywise does to scare the protagonists. True, these episodes are somewhat frightening in and of themselves, but not nearly as scary as similar episodes in the book that are explained in full. Likewise the climax (which comes, and ends, all too quickly and seemingly easily). It's true nature is visualized but not explained, leaving the viewer puzzled and unfulfilled.<BR>On the positive side, the actors portraying the protagonists at age 11 are a wonder to behold. For the most part, they each manage to capture the essence of King's young characters. The scenes with these kids show depth and charisma that elevate the movie, for those brief moments, above the poor direction and low budget. The adult actors, however, can't seem to rise above either of those two things and at times seem to overact as if that might compensate for poor dialogue and uneven directing.<BR>All in all, &quot;It&quot; does have a few moments of slight terror, but in the end, the weaknesses outweigh the strengths. Without heart, and with little horror, &quot;It&quot; fails to please. True King fanatics will want to watch the movie, but will also be the most disappointed. I suggest they rent the video and spend their money on &quot;Stand By Me&quot; or &quot;The Shawshank Redemption&quot; or, if they must have a King horror movie, &quot;Carrie.&quot; For those who may just be interested in getting to know this Stephen King classic, READ THE BOOK! The 1100 pages fly by almost of their own accord, and the end result is much more satisfying.
B000066NW0|3.0|Avril Lavigne might have an image as fake as any artist out there, but I don't judge music by the artist.  With that said, I really only found a handful of the songs on this album worthwhile.  <BR>Avril says that she writes music based on the way she feels at the time, this at least seems to be true.  She is still a teenager trying to find herself and it shows.  Almost all of the songs are about her in some way.  Which would be fine if she were more in tune with who she is.  The lyrics to some songs might have even worked with better musical arrangements or tempos.<BR>But in the end - I could hardly stand to get through all but 4 or 5 of the songs.  Avril shows some promise, but doesn't deliver.
B00005JM0B|5.0|About a couple of days after its release, I managed to check out the highly anticipated \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" at the theater, and let me tell you that the film blew me away! Especially since \\"T3\\" has spectacular action sequences and awesome special effects from start to finish! Yet, to me, \\"Terminator 3\\" is not better than \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\" (which will forever remain one of the best action films of all time), but it is, however, better than the first \\"Terminator\\" film from way back in 1984. I do regret them not picking James Cameron to direct \\"T3\\", but I do give kudos to director Jonathan Mostow (\\"U-571\\") for his intense direction of this film. And guess who's back?! That's right! Superstar Arnold Schwarzenegger (\\"Collateral Damage\\") is back in the role that made him a household name...\\"The Terminator\\"! Joining him are Nick Stahl (\\"In The Bedroom\\"), Claire Danes (\\"The Hours\\"), and Kristanna Loken (TV's \\"Mortal Kombat: Conquest\\"), in which they gave tremendous performances as well.<br />\\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" starts out about 12 years after the events of \\"Terminator 2: Judgment Day\\". The apocalyptic prediction of Judgment Day was never prevented, only postponed. John Connor (Stahl), now 22, is living \\"off the grid\\" (meaning no credit cards, no cell phone, etc.), being totally disconnected from society. During the film, Connor is being pursued by the T-X (Loken), another ruthless killing machine from the future sent by Skynet, the evil supercomputer that controls machines from all around the world. T-X's mission is to pick up where her predecessor (the liquid metal T-1000) left off: to stop Connor from becoming the savior of mankind. Then, soon enough, an obsolete, disadvantaged T-850 Terminator (Schwarzenegger) arrives from the future to protect Connor and Kate Brewster (Danes), a girl from his past, in triumphing over the technologically superior T-X and forestall the looming threat of Judgment Day...or it will be the end of life as we know it!<br />In conclusion, \\"Terminator 3\\" has it all: Action, suspense, a powerful storyline, laugh-out-loud humor that Schwarzenegger can always provide us with, and pulse-pounding special effects! \\"Terminator 3: Rise of the Machines\\" is, without a doubt, one of the best action films that I've seen all summer and will be an unforgettable DVD must-have addition to the first two \\"Terminator\\" films!
B00003CX9E|5.0|This is simply the greatest film of all time.  A true original.<BR>While it is true that some lighting techniques that are employed are dated and worn, you wouldn't have to go far (for instance the blockbuster Harry Potter films) to see that these techniques are still used OVER SIXTY YEARS LATER.  The cast (especially Orson Welles) brilliantly portray very realistic feeling characters.  The camera was used to enhance the story's changing moods and directions, but Orson Welles never gets caught up on making the picture so spectacular as to overshadow the plot.  Through each and every scene the story becomes more involving, building a suspense that climaxes with the final shot.<BR>This is the way movies should be done.  So many movies in the past half century have tried to imitate the simple brilliance of Citizen Kane but have fallen short.
B00009V93Z|4.0|Wow - how many takes did Elvis do? Hey, I dig most of what I've heard of these latecomers. On this package the must-hears on CD #1, \\"Stereo Masters From the '50s\\", are the long version of \\"Jailhouse Rock\\" (the original single version presented in binaural - terrible on headphones, with the unnatural separation); and the completely unissued \\"(You're So Sqare) Baby, I Don't Care\\", a much different vocal from the well-known classic, displaying his incredible vocal flexibility and imagination. With almost complete vocal isolation we hear Presley in the most intimate way possible on these \\"stereo\\" tracks - \\"Young And Beautiful\\" becomes the ultimate Elvis valentine.<BR>From \\"Unreleased Movie Gems\\", all four of the ballads from \\"Wild In The Country\\", particularly the originally unused \\"Forget Me Never\\", are stunning. The new softer ballad style, developped by Elvis and Charlie Hodge in Europe, works perfectly here. \\"Moonlight Swim\\" from \\"Blue Hawaii\\" is another work of art - the Dean Martin feel is a little more to the fore.<BR>CD# 3, \\"The Magic Of Nashville\\", highlights the gospel \\"Working On The Building\\" - although Elvis defers to his august complement, the effect is mesmerizing, from the beautiful lone guitar introduction to the conclusion. \\"That's Someone You Never Forget\\" is magical alright: this impressive personal statement should be heard by all Music Appreciation students. First heard as a '62 album cut, then a '67 flipside, it got kind of lost. It seems that Grammy Awards at the time related only to full albums or A-sides. (Maybe in '03/'04 a new category can apply to this miraculous performance). The '66 gospel song \\"Somebody Bigger Than You And I\\" is splendidly mixed - the blend of Elvis' solemn low voice with the singers and musicians is an example for all engineers. The heart ballad \\"Mine\\" has a classical touch and Elvis does a fine job, but the middle-section lacks somethings and the song never reaches an emotional peak. This take is  close to the first released take. It's one of many from the movie period which I feel warranted later reworking.<BR>\\"Live In Texas 1972\\", apparently from the \\"Elvis On Tour\\" movie shows, has just two standouts - a \\"Burning Love\\" that *burns* and an astonishing \\"American Trilogy\\". It appears that this is the same effort also filmed which captures devastated patrons expressing their excitement and interest. Presley was so powerful on stage that a non-romantic theme could also provoke sustained screams.<BR>A bold offer such as \\"Close Up\\" can also reveal certain artistic dilemmas. On the previously mentioned title tune from \\"Wild In The County\\" Elvis attempts the middle-eight a la Mario Lanza and he nails it...but then his breath gives out. Or he and others in attendance realize that this approach would be problematic on this soft statement. The recorded result is the less satsifying gentle falsetto which does not really support the song title with the word \\"wild\\". Big El went for many big notes in his career and it's too bad he didn't go back and try again. There's a few more items which make us wonder why he didn't apply his full voice to the number. The Adult Contemporary/Beat Ballad if-you-will \\"Just Tell Her Jim Said Hello\\" is certainly melodious but another case-in-point: the vocal bridge would have been more effective with dramatic fortisimo. Perhaps the leap from quiet in the verse to loud in the vocal bridge would have been awkward but if you refer to several takes of \\"Surrender\\" (a very strong rendition found here) you wonder why he chose to croon so often during this period. Ofcourse it still is a notable B-side. <BR>Terrific notes and rare photos are included. \\"Elvis: Close Up\\". In the words of his buddy Tom Jones...\\"Get 'Closer'\\": RCA/BMG, keep 'em comin'!
0316921173|1.0|The title of my review says it all...Don't even bother with this wannabe Pynchon.
B00007LTIB|5.0|Finally, the new series of Yes remasters contains *all* of the original artwork, new and detailed liner notes, and for the first time, bonus tracks of single edits and studio outtakes, many of which have never been heard before.  But beyond that, the layers of muddiness and hiss that were still partly present on the last round of remasters have been removed for good. &quot;Relayer&quot;, along with &quot;Going For The One&quot;, benefits the most from this; one listen to the crystal-clear, warm intro to &quot;To Be Over&quot; will convince even the jaded that this is superior to any version previous, including the original vinyl.  <br />Although &quot;Fragile&quot; and &quot;Close To The Edge&quot; are their most perfect marriages of experimentation and accessibility, and &quot;Going For The One&quot; continued that tradition with  spectacular results, &quot;Relayer&quot; is in many ways the greatest Yes album.  With &quot;Tales&quot; the group attempted to push the boundaries of rock to their furthest limits but were hampered by a lack of energy, repetitious padding, impenetrable lyrics and sagging, even boring melodies.  It had its moments, but I'm one of those who continues to agree with Wakeman's assertion that it could have been far better with some judicicious editing, since it did have moments of beauty and inspiration. <br />Although far different in sound and style (the group traded in its traditional symphonic prog sound for a more electronic and jazz-fusion oriented approach), &quot;Relayer&quot; is really the perfection of what they were trying to achieve with &quot;Tales&quot; in terms of making their music as dense, complex and experimental as possible.  &quot;The Gates Of Delirium&quot; is without a doubt to these ears their greatest side-long achievement and possibly the best suite in all of rock; unlike &quot;Tales&quot; this music actually has a pulse, which rocks *hard*.  And the marriage of classically inspired structure and themes with heavy rock riffs and supple, exciting fusion rhythms from Squire and White--a mix not easy to pull off well--is sublime.  The closing ballad &quot;Soon&quot;, with its soaring vocals and lush, gorgeous atmospherics provided by Howe's reverbed slide and Moraz's mellotron is capped by a melody that sounds born to the ages, a truly timeless moment that is my absolute favorite in the Yes canon.  The many layers and ever-shifting sections of this track may take a few listens to get used to, but it is well worth it.  <br />As if the incredible structural and instrumental complexity, fire and grandeur of &quot;Gates&quot; weren't enough, &quot;Sound Chaser&quot; <BR>tops it for sheer virtuosic bravura, a truly mind-boggling piece<BR>that closes with the band playing an incredibly difficult riff (Squire proves beyond a shadow of a doubt that he is rock's most accomplished bassist) that is slowed down and sped up with such precision that it sounds like the tape has been manipulated, but it has not!  Other highlights include Moraz's rippling electric piano work (he actually proved here to be a more diverse and experimental keyboardist than Wakeman, and although he arrived too late to have a hand in composing the songs, his atmospheric additions fit perfectly) and a thunderous Howe solo.  The closing &quot;To Be Over&quot; is arguably their most beautiful epic ballad, beating out even &quot;And You And I&quot;.  It begins with a lilting, quasi-oriental melody played on acoustic guitar, synths and electric guitar before moving into the breezy verses and more shifting, jazzy solos that closes on a magical, wordless chant which again sounds like something taken from an ancient, timeless lost culture.  <br />Overall, the music on &quot;Relayer&quot; remains Yes's most intense.  It is obvious that they were bursting with new musical ideas and the level of composition and playing does truly fulfill the lofty aspirations of progressive rock--&quot;The Gates Of Delirium&quot; might as well have been composed by Wagner or Stravinsky, although it rocks harder in places than the heaviest metal.  The ballads are simply amazing.  The unreleased bonus cut, a studio run-through of &quot;Gates&quot; is fascinating and worth the purchase alone for Yes fans, detailing as it does the track's development with different lyrics and the absence of Moraz's synths, which allows the other layers to be heard more clearly. This album is well, well worth its bargain price and once again, Rhino has outclassed the competition.
B00005JKZV|2.0|After reading the first hundred reviews on this site, I must admit I am still hunting for those rabid purists I have heard so much about...<br />The negative reviews which I have read, have for the most part admitted and appreciated the difficulty of translating Tolkien's masterpiece to the screen while disagreeing with the changes Peter Jackson chose to incorporate into TTT.<br />Am I missing something here?  Since when does wishing a movie would be *more* true to its namesake make one a fanatic who should shut up, get a life, and not bother those who know how to &quot;truly enjoy&quot; a good movie?<br />What makes a compendium of reviews valuable is the rich difference of opinions.  Certainly, for those who loved the movie, say so!  Tell us about what you enjoyed.  But give those who differ from you the same privilege and allow them their &quot;negative&quot; opinion.<br />That being said, I join the ranks of those who were very disappointed in TTT.  I enjoyed FOTR and own the extended edition, which, while it differs from the book at points, is true to the spirit of the book.  3 cheers for Peter Jackson!  If he had not done so well with movie #1, I wouldn't have been at the theater with such high expectations for movie #2.<br />I would have enjoyed TTT as a stand-alone movie titled differently.  However, I went to the theater to see Tolkien's work, not some other hybrid plot that happened to bear the same name--with enough points in common to show that it was, indeed, trying to recreate the same story, but so many MAJOR things completely different...<br />So let me be disappointed.  No, my world isn't ending, nor will I be picketing in front of the theater come December.  That doesn't mean you can't like the movie.<br />And if that makes me a &quot;rabid purist&quot;--well, then so be it.
B000092ZYX|5.0|Radiohead have gone and done it again and produced a brilliant album.  For those fans who are hardcore Bends fanatics and feel betrayed by the experimentation done on Kid A and Amnesiac, you will not be disappointed by this album.  And for fans who prefer the light-on-the-guitars approach taken by the two most recent records, well, you will not be disappointed either.  The band has made an album that blends their early work with the latter-day Radiohead and produced a heavenly median.  Standout tracks are 2+2=5, We Suck Young Blood, There There, The Gloaming, and Punch up at a Wedding.  Of course, being Radiohead, these songs are just the extra-exceptional of the 'merely' exceptional.  I recently saw Radiohead perform at the Tweeter Center in Massachusetts and was able to experience many of the songs off of \\"Hail.\\"  All I have to say is whatever it is they are doing, they should keep at it, because it's working.  Really, really well.
B00008NRL8|4.0|If you think that electronica tango is some kind of new amazing development in music that is going to develop and mature for years to come then you must also believe the Billy Ray Cyrus is the next Hank Williams.<br />This tango electronica fusion with the accordian blarring is nice for a brief moment.  But after some listening it becomes rather monotonous.<br />There is a new pure french touch exclusive downtempo funk jazz electronica record called Paris Under A Groove.  Check these new artists out along with an unreleased track from St Germain to understand what is really great about french electronica.  Timeless funky loops and great jazz instrumentals abound.  Looks like at least one of these new artists is the next big thing. Peace and happy listening au revoir.
B00009P1O0|5.0|back in the day when i was a drifter, i thought heavy metal was my bag. this girl i met out west made me a tape of \\"on the beach\\" and listened to it over and over in the van while my band was touring. they all got sick of it, but i couldn't believe my ears. many years have passed, but my path changed back then and my life is a thousand percent different. and that's a good thing. neil, i love you and i thank you.
B00005JKN9|5.0|Many will disagree with me on that comment, but I feel it's true.  Daniel Day-Lewis steals this one by a long shot.  This is HIS film.  Forget Leo...Leo who?  I swear, when you watch this, you can't wait until you see the character of the Butcher again.  Though it is long, it plays a lot shorter than the actual length.  The only real bummer is that the DVD is split in two with the movie playing in full length over the course of two discs.  That aside, this is one of the greatest films of 2002, and shame on the Academy for not awarding Lewis on his performance.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|Well looks like maiden's writing skills have finally been poured down the drain.They have gotten quite boring in there middle age,gone are the once beautiful harmonies that use to fill there CD's with its presence,gone are the interesting stories they use to tell,gone are the galloping drum beats Nicko(the master) use to trot down,and have been replaced with dull,slow paced,boring mid tempo songs.First off the lyrics have suffered terribly,they seem to be trying TO hard to pull of things they havent written in about 15 years.And bruces voice doesnt sound BAD,by any means,but you can tell he's REALLY struggling to hit the old high's he once did on Beast,and Piece.Not happening.And just when you think the pace of the songs is about to quicken,its muddled by another mid tempo,steady paced tempo.What HAPPENED?The only two songs worth the listen are the single,(wildest dreams),and the song montsegur,which sound kinda close to the old school maiden that the rest of the album lacks.But all in all..the songs pretty much sound like the last 3 albums,even some sounding like the X-factor with bruce at the helm singing.And sorry but this album like the last 3 is WAY over produced for maiden,not raw enough as it should be.Oh well i will say its better than Queensryche's new piece of plastic trash.But not one of the top albums of 2003(as it should have been).
B000002LND|5.0|For years, I've listened to this hits package and it STILL amazes me as to how much she has grown in the music world.  When you listen to early Madonna hits such as Lucky Star and Borderline, the average fan would think &quot;Oh no, not another disco wannabe!&quot;  She did back-up Patrick Hernandez's hit &quot;Born to be Alive&quot;!<br />But, you knew that there was something special with this artist.  She was NOT DESTINED to fade away like some other artists.  Along with Donna Summer and Cher, Madonna is the best dance music artist ever!  It's hard to believe that Cyndi Lauper beat her out for a Grammy for Best New Artist back in 1984!<br />The casual fan will enjoy this album although hits like &quot;Angel&quot; are missing only because there is no time left available.  But there is enough to satisfy everyone.
B000002X4T|4.0|This was the magical swan song for the classic (as opposed to original) lineup of the Jefferson Airplane---Marty Balin would soon leave to go solo, and the others would soldier on with new members. In one sense, the timing of his departure was perfect. Volunteers is the most political of the Airplane's albums--political enough to include the anthem of the Soviet army (Meadowlands) as one of the songs. (In an enclosure to the new edition, they &quot;retract&quot; many of the sentiments of this album.) Also, this album features one of the all-time great Airplane performances, &quot;Wooden Ships,&quot; an &quot;anguished cry&quot; of a song that sums up the stance of both a year and a generation perfectly. CSN's &quot;original&quot; version (in many ways they are two different songs) sounds overly sunny and almost simplistic by comparison. Guitarist Jorma Kaukonen plays one of his very best solos here. He also cowrites the gentle &quot;Turn My Life Down&quot; with Marty and sings the biblical &quot;Good Shepard&quot; to great effect. Grace, as always, strikes a wonderfully personal note for relationships with &quot;Hey Frederick&quot; and waxes profound with &quot;Eskimo Blue Day&quot;. Lyrically, &quot;A Song for All Seasons&quot; is not bad, but the band ruins it's effectiveness by giving it to road manager Bill Laudner to sing. Still, he's a longtime Airplane employee and, I'm sure, a first-rate road manager. &quot;Volunteers&quot; is Marty's rabble-rousing closer, with excellent piano work by Nicky Hopkins. (The revolution would, literally, strike too close to home for Marty at the Altamont concert later that year, when he was knocked unconscious by rogue Hell's Angels.) In many ways, Volunteers is a great album, ranked just a shade below all-time classics Surrealistic Pillow, After Bathing at Baxters, and Crown of Creation. Play this album, and see how its philosophy (inspired more by the sci-fi classic Stranger in a Strange Land than by true politics) holds up today for you.
0380789035|1.0|I picked up this book on the recommendation from a friend who raved about it. Sorry, but I don't see the appeal. The first couple of chapters were interesting, but then the book just petered out and become dull. I usually read books fairly quickly, but I found little motivation to return to this story. I forced myself to finish the book only to see if it was ever going somewhere. Sadly, it did not. Just when I thought Gaiman was going somewhere with the plot, he would consistently muse about nothing. Must have been very slim pickings for the judges to have picked this one for a Hugo.
B0000AQS6U|5.0|It has all her hits and even hard to find ones such as the radio dance edit of One By One.  All her most famous songs are on this disk.  You can bop to Shoop Shoop, Believe, Gypsys Tramps and Theives, All Or Nothing, Strong Enough, and ballads such as Turn Back Time, I Found Someone, and I Got You Babe.  Some of the songs I do not know becasue they are not from my generation but most of them are good anyway.  This is a great buy.  The best part is that this version comes with the bonus cd live in concert The Farewell Tour.  This cd has songs like Still Havent Found What Im Looking For, Song for the lonely, After All and all the other hits live.  SO as you can see this cd is excellent and an essential for your cd collection.
B00000255F|5.0|This is some of the all time funkiest rock and roll. Practically nothing beats the funk of 70's Springsteen and the E Street Band. If you do not like funk, do not buy this album. If you don't like music that's so good it hurts to listen to, don't buy this album.<br />The instrumentals and the lyrics are amazing...
B00004RF9I|5.0|Network was way ahead of its time!  This film shows how a television network can take something that can actually enlighten and empower people and turn it into entertainment.  It's also interesting to see the network's ratings skyrocket by feeding reality TV programs into the minds of its viewers.  If you look at the saturation of reality shows today you can see that screenwriter Paddy Chayesfky was an oracle of his era.<br />What I also got from this film is the discarding of old ideas and replacing them with new ones.  The William Holden and Peter Finch characters (these guys were already established movie stars) represented the old ideas; and the Robert Duvall and Faye Dunaway characters (by this time they were becoming big movie stars) represented the new ideas-a brilliant move on the part of the casting department.<br />Lastly, Paddy Chayesfky's screenwriting work is superb!!!!!!   The words have so much substance and color to them!  These days you hardly come across a movie with rich, propelling dialogue.<br />This movie is worth 20 stars.  But to be fair to the rating system, giving it five is still good.
B00005Q66T|5.0|Certainly, this is an enjoyable album for both the hardcore and casual fan.  Yes, songs such as &quot;You'll See&quot;, &quot;Rain&quot;, and &quot;Bad Girl&quot; are missing, but not necessary.  I agree if you buy GHV2, then you MUST buy the IMMACULATE collection!  <br />Madonna will continue to get more hits in the future and I'm certain that there will be a GHV3 10 years from now!  I like the packaging too!
B00003CXIY|5.0|... this movie is the funniest movie i have ever seen. i thought tom green would be in it more but he did sing the tiny salmon song that made me laugh for a good 3 hours or so. so if i were you, i would buy this movie.
0385504209|5.0|Normally I am not the type to read murder mysteries, I generally read non-fiction.  But someone at work read this, they told a few people how incredible it was, they told a few more and eventually I read it.  I read it over Labor Day weekend while camping and I suggest you find similar down time because once you pick this up you will NEVER want to put it down.<br />This book puts into question everything we grew up learning and teaches you a few interesting things you never knew.  I highly recommend this book to anybody, no matter what type of book you like to read.<br />I cannot say enough about how good this book is!

SO as you can see this cd is excellent and an essential for your cd collection.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|After languishing for three years, the new Iron Maiden album finally was released and I couldn't be happier. After hearing the first single &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; a month ago, I was a little disappointed and wary of the new album. The song was not bad, but was pretty lackluster as far as first album singles go. But once I popped in the disc, I found myself to be quite happy with the results. I compare the CD very favorably to the last release &quot;Brave New World&quot; in that the band keeps exploring new ways to transform their music. Highlights include the hard rocking &quot;Montsegur&quot;, the eery title track &quot;Dance of Death&quot;, the catchy chorus of &quot;New Frontier&quot; and probably the most memorable track on the album &quot;Paschendale&quot;. I give this album only 4 stars because I literally bought it today and have only listened through it twice, but I can definitely see it growing on me tremendously.
B00005JLSE|2.0|This DVD was a real disappointment. It failed on all levels. Musically, it was mostly deriviative, as a drama it was poorly motivated, failing even at being a send up of its own genre. It went on and on without developing interest or character, leaving this audience member bored and disinterested.
B000002UUX|5.0|this is an awesome album.the guitar work is amazing,and the bass and drums are great also.megadeth is without a doubt one of the most talented bands of all time.dave mustaine and marty friedman shred with unbelievable technical precission on this album.i think they are the greatest guitar duo of all time. here, as other albums before this, megadeth prove that they are far better than metallica ever has been or can ever hope to be. hammet and hetfield are nothing compared to mustaine and friedman.this is one of the best albums from the greatest band ever, MEGADETH.<br />holy wars-amazing.one of the best songs here.holy wars is awesome but i prefer the second half,the punishment due.awesome lyrics. A+<br />hangar 18-amzing solos and an amazing song. A+<br />take no prisoners-pure angry thrash.awesome bass.awesome everything. A+<br />five magics-really cool song.im not sure, but i think that it is about warhammer.great bass intro and guitar. A+<br />poison was the cure- more great bass.really fast.totally awesome A+<br />lucretia-pretty cool.not one of the greatest here, but still awesome. A+<br />tornado of souls- an amazing song with great riffs, lyrics, and solos. A+<br />dawn patrol-i think this is a really cool bass line and a great song.awesome lyrics. A+<br />rust in peace- the final and probably best song here.everything about it is amazing. A+
B000002LR3|5.0|A modern psych classic, capturing the vibrant, mind-blowing experience of Ecstacy in a joyful hybrid. Successfully balancing the jangly &quot;Beggar's Banquet&quot;-era Stones rock with the thick, trippy soundscapes of rave culture, this was the soundtrack of countless raves in the British colony circa the early 90's. If course it's easy to see why it is so acclaimed: switching between uplifting gospel-techno anthems like &quot;Movin' On Up&quot; and &quot;Come Together&quot; to sinister, dark beats like &quot;Slip Inside This House&quot;, there's never a dull moment in the Primals' euphoric vision for a united world order. Although it is sometimes hard to see why an album made such a big impact during a particular time, it's easy to see this album's universal appeal: we just wanna get loaded.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|DOD is a great record that should be embraced by the metal community. There are guitar solos, and guitar leads for riffs all over this; something that many metal bands can't pull off anymore. It's not classic maiden, it's maiden for 2003, just the same as it was back when Seventh Son came out. That album was nothing like NOTB or Piece of mind, but it was still great. DOD is definitely the bands best since Seventh son.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|First impressions are that this is not quite the masterpiece that the band's previous album, 2000's &quot;Brave New World&quot;, was.  But, still, this album is prime Maiden, easily matching their 80's efforts like &quot;Number Of The Beast&quot; and &quot;Seventh Son...&quot;.<br />Unlike Metallica, Maiden knows what they are capable of and they know what their fans are looking for.  There's no ego here and that's refreshing...just maturing legends doing what they do best.  Namely, creating that instantly recognizable melodic-yet-heavy metal that is intricate and catchy.  And Bruce's vocals haven't faded one iota, the man still has amazing power.<br />One track really stand out right now, &quot;Rainmaker&quot;.  Already, I group that song with all-time Maiden classics like &quot;Wasted Years&quot;, &quot;Run To The Hills&quot;, &quot;Aces High&quot;, and &quot;Infinite Dreams&quot;.  The title track, &quot;Dance Of Death&quot;, is pretty amazing too, with full orchestration and that classic Maiden occult theme.<br />My only complaint here is the album cover...it looks amateurish compared to the brilliant cover of &quot;Brave New World&quot;.  The concept is cool, but the execution just doesn't work, looks like it was done on a computer.<br />Bottom line is, you need this album.  If only to wash away the bad taste that is Metallica's latest disappointment, &quot;St. Anger&quot;.<br />Maiden rules!  Up the irons!!!
B0000BYM3K|1.0|If i had known that this would be a pile of bland recycled commercial metal then i would have definitely avoided paying money for this album. I love iron maiden, and an album like this hurts. I would say that this ranks below futureal and slightly(just barely) above the x factor as the worst album that maiden has made. Let me elaborate:<BR>1)this album has NO feeling and does not evoke any emotions except dullness<BR>2)the sound of the album is too clear and soft it sounds like it was played by machines<BR>3)Same chord patterns everywhere. same progressions same rythms.A lot of the riffs seem recycled throughout the album. Has the mighty maiden finally run out of ideas? <BR>4)Janick Gers-thats right, he needs to go. He absolutely ruined the classic maiden sound. He has influenced the others in the band to play in a dull modern fashion. What i particulary dislike about him is the ANNOYING AND NUMBLINGLY IRRITATING chord patterns that he always plays in every song(a la fear of the dark, afraid to shoot strangers, and the clansman) that makes the music lose its edge.<BR>5)It sounds just like futureal except worse. The songs are written in the exact same styles with the exact same sound.<BR>6)The solos are dull. dull dull. TERRIBLE. There is no passion in these masturbations! and to make it more annoying they are almost always followed by an annoying and repetitive harmony line.<BR>7) Are we sure it is Bruce singing?- yes unfortunately it is him but there are times when he sounds like blaze bayley! maybe its because the songs on this album could easily have been the same songs on Futureal!<BR>8) the lyrics are RE-TARD-ED. I know maiden lyrics have always been cheesy but at least they were about cool things. These lyrics are almost trying to be pathetically inspirational. <BR>9)There really arent any interesting time changes or in that case interesting parts to any of the songs<BR>10) The only good song on the album ,Monstesqu or whatever it is called, is completely ruined by the ATROCIOUS harmony line placed in some of the verses which turns it from a heavy song to something that sounds like a pathetic top gun anthem.<br />I AM VERY DISAPPOINTED WITH THIS ALBUM. MAIDEN HAVE RETURNED INTO THE DARK PIT THAT THEY WERE IN DURING THE 90s. Brave New World brought back hope and made us think that maiden was back but it seems that they have just lost all their creativity. I think that if their next album is not MUCH stronger they should seriously retire.
0425170349|1.0|This book is bad, bad rubbish with extra bad for good measure. It represents little more than a vehicle to wax lyrical about how good and great American soldiers (and their little buddies in the UK) are.<br />Perhaps the worst aspect of it is the horrible boorish characters. Both the good guys and the bad guys (the latter actually being a term used by the former) are emotionless, one dimensional cartoon characters. The Rainbow team are all squeaky clean superheroes. Their wives are all straw-person brainless babymakers. All the other women are evil and conniving. Anyone with environmental concerns is a treehugger. Perhaps worst of all is the cultural and racial stereotypes applied to so many of the non-American characters. British men-even bartenders refer to people as &quot;chaps&quot;. Obviously Clancy has only ever spoken with Torys like Jeffrey Archer or John Major so he wouldn't know that 80% of British men DO NOT say &quot;chaps&quot;. Australian men DEFINITELY never EVER use the term.<br />I've noticed a lot of 12 year olds like this book. That's about the demographic it's written for.
B000001DTM|5.0|Perhaps the greatest transformation a pop band ever underwent, maybe even bigger than the Beatles themselves, U2 went from a religiously influenced anthem band in the Eighties to prophets of the TV age in Nineties. This album was no Joshua Tree; it was an exciting foray into the electronic genre in which U2 would spend the Nineties. At the end of the decade that U2 helped to characterize, it was either sink or swim: their religious prophet schtick was getting tired, and 1988's Rattle and Hum was a fatal mistake that almost did them in. After a tense studio session in Berlin that nearly tore the band apart, guitarist the Edge lay down a guitar riff and Bono improvised lyrics that would become their finest work: the ballad &quot;One&quot;. Of course the rest is history. Critically adored for being the brave transformation U2 needed to stay credible in a new age, it has also become the band's second-most revered album among their fans: the dark, turbulent yin to the Joshua Tree's dark, more straightforward yang. The strong flow of songs is never disrupted and it has been regarded as the band's Revolver. Whatever it is, it can be regarded as the album that saved U2 -- and the Nineties. How ironic.
B00009V7T2|4.0|I think this cd is awesome. I admit I think Many people will hate it because its not At the Drive In plus because it doesnt conform to the generic, tired 'screamo', 'emo' sounds that are oversaturating the music scene. They are simply not afraid to be different. If you want to hear something innovative, thoughful and fresh check this out. If you want to listen to something that has been done a million times check out that no-talented jerk from dashboard that all the 12 year old girls are so crazy about.
B0000A02TZ|1.0|Be warned, you are paying all this money for a 10 min. &quot;Where are they now?&quot; clip and a music video... wow. The other stuff can be found on the collector's edition DVD (which has much better packaging).<br />I was looking for bonus footage and such, even an audio commentary. NOPE!!! Not here. This is a plain waste of money.<br />For a 25th anniversary, you would think they could have put a much better package together. *Every* movie, unless all the original reels are lost, has more footage than ever will be used/seen. It would have been nice for some outtakes, or deleted scenes. Nothing. Nada. Zilch. Nill.
B000060P79|4.0|This cd is great. It has some good points and a couple bad points.<br />1. I'd Do Anything: 8/10: Good song, but gets repetitive.<BR>2.

B000005DQR|5.0|Is the world going awry when hip-hop, a predominantly black musical genre, is invaded by whites? Eminem is the most captivating MC today, but back in '96, a white DJ stole everyone's thunder with a brilliant, symphonic album consisting entirely of samples. It's not as haphazard as it sounds; Shadow took piano lines, thunderous drums, guitars, surreal spoken-word pieces and mad scratches, put them all together in a way that shouldn't work (but somehow does) and made hip-hop seem expansive again. It's a testament to a man's genius when he can take cheesy old horror movie dialogue and make it seem timeless. It has been six years now since this gem was released to critical adoration reserved for the likes of Jesus and whatnot, and it seems not a day older. Classical music for the 21st century.
B00006674X|3.0|Indeed.  I guess you have to look at this movie in this context.  It looks dated, kind of like those really bad TV shows of the late 60s and early 70s.   The dialogue is terrible, laughable at some points - &quot;she was raped, even against her will&quot; - give me a break!<br />Elvis looks good, before he blimped out on cheeseburgers and drugs and Mary Tyler Moore is her usual annoying self - its said they didnt get on - not unsurprisingly.  <br />The supporting cast is not too bad - good to see Ed Asner in an early role.   This is one of Elvis lost films, so to speak, in that if you are not a fan then you would not really know about it.   <br />Worth a look.   The DVD is good quality as is the VHS.   The songs are pretty duff but whats new?<br />It looks like he was trying to get his movie career back on track but was perhaps side tracked by live performances.
0060934913|4.0|It's hard to believe that Anthony Bourdain's entire working life to date has been crammed into 300 pages.  It a fantastic book for anyone interested in the 'behind the scenes' look at restaurants.  At the time when a CIA degree was no big deal, Anthony decided that he wanted to become a chef.  With degree in hand, he began working.  He took jobs as a dishwasher just to get in the kitchen.  He briefly talks about when to eat at a restaurant and when not to.  As well as what to look out for if you decide to eat out.  There's even a section where he recommends specific kitchen knives and ingredients you need to have on hand.  Most of the book though is dedicated to his life as a chef.  You'll love it!

B00008S2VG|5.0|This CD is a pure gift for those studing kabbalah, the source for lyrics and emotions on this CD. If you havent studied kabbalah for soem time and understood its teaching this CD is absolutly empty for you, go a head and cop that britney, j-lo, justin timberlake cd, well basicly anything with lyrics of ur love not costing anything or being real of ur love being better than someone elses u know all the deep stuff that american culture is studing now. However if uve been thinking about life philosophy, this CD has soem great insights for you, and not to mention it got purely genious beats. the music is like if u take the neptunes sound and make it completly raw and dry to the bone.<BR>so fellow kabbalist COP THIS DISK!!! it will be your sound track for the journey, others go get glad and sign im not a girl but im not a woman yet.
B00001OH7Y|5.0|This is David Bowie's finest album, bar none. The lyrics, singing and musicianship displayed here are all top notch. Bowie was at the top of his game, and unfortunately has not come close since. \\"Teenage Wildlife\\" is simultaneously soaring and deeply personal, probably the best single song Bowie ever recorded. \\"It's No Game\\" (both parts) are eviscerating and tell a twisted tale. \\"Scary Monsters\\" rocks out, supported by Robert Fripp's absolutely amazing guitar lines. \\"Ashes to Ashes\\" reveals the fate of Major Tom after he completed his \\"Space Oddity\\". The rest of the songs are equally compelling. This is not only Bowie's best, but one of the Top 10 albums of the 80's.

0553801511|3.0|Golden Fool is the second book in the Tawny Man series.  It's set in the same world as Hobbs' Assassin books and her Liveship Trader books, and does even more to tie the two series together, sometimes to its detriment.  While it's not necessarily a bad book, it failed to hold my interest for long periods of time, which is very unusual for a Robin Hobb book.<br />When I read the first book, Fool's Errand, I thought Hobb spent too much of the beginning going over old history in lecture-fashion, basically telling us what happened in the intervening fifteen years by one character telling another what happened.  It was long and boring, but once the book got moving, I couldn't put it down.  This book suffers from similar problems, but it never really recovers from them.  It is packed full of character development and not a lot else.  The book moves at a glacial pace, and when you get to the end of it, you'll discover that not much happened.  There has been some progress in Fitz's attempt to form a group of Skill users to help the Prince, the kidnappers are eventually dealt with, and the Prince and his entourage begin a quest that will take them through the third book.<br />A large portion of the book is taken up with events from the Liveship Trader series of books, and the war between Bingtown and Chalced from those books.  A delegation from Bingtown arrives to try and get the Queen to join their side, and there is much discussion of the different natures of dragons in this world (there appeared to be some incompatibility between the dragons in the original Farseer books and the Liveship Traders books...these incompatibilities are explained).  Thus, there is much exposition explaining what happened in that series, ostensibly because only rumours and weird accounts have reached the ears of the Six Duchies.  Again, this slows the book to a crawl, and I didn't see a lot of benefit to it, as the Bingtown people eventually disappear without much being done with them.  It seems like such a waste, though I suppose this may be a setup for the next book.<br />The other problem with the book is that it's very depressing, as Fitz has nothing but relationship problems in the book.  The relationship between him and The Fool (his best friend and a strange man who is more than he seems) takes a really sour turn.  We do learn a lot about the Fool, but it comes at the expense of their relationship.  Then there is his relationship with his foster son, Hap, and the trials and tribulations that come with that.  There is Jinna, a hedge witch who he sleeps with but doesn't love, and thus feels awful about it.  He and Chade argue quite often, even as Chade pushes him to not only teach the Prince the Skill, but himself as well.  At times, the book seems to be nothing but arguments, and while many of them are dealt with eventually, they're tedious to read through.<br />The characters themselves are ok, but I don't like what was done with them.  I've already detailed Fitz's problems, but there are others as well.  The Fool, my favourite character in the previous book, doesn't do a whole lot in this one.  He sulks a lot, helps Fitz out occasionally before their relationship goes sour, and is generally boring otherwise.  I never thought I'd say that about this character.  His connection to the Liveship Trader series is revealed, but never really explained.  I would have appreciated either one or the other: either explain most of it, or don't reveal it.  Instead, it's the worst of both worlds as we know the truth but we have no idea why it is the truth.<br />Fitz is a spy as well as an assassin, and he spends a lot of time observing things from secret tunnels.  Thus, Hobb gets around the limitation of first person storytelling: you can only reveal the narrator's point of view.  There are times where this doesn't feel natural, like it's only there so Hobb can tell us something is happening.  He also spends a lot of time recovering from the only real action in the novel, and this tends to drag as well, again exposing another weakness of first-person: when the main character gets boring, you can't move on to somebody else.<br />It took me a couple of weeks to read this book, where the first one just took a few days.  I never had the feeling that I couldn't put it down, or that I must pick it up and read more to see what's happening.  I love the characters in this series, and I feel a lot of loyalty to them.  I think that's the only reason I kept going.  There is also a lot of potential, and the book ends with the beginning of an interesting-sounding quest.  This one has the same feel that many other &quot;second books&quot; have, which is as a placeholder.  Hopefully Hobb will rebound with the third and final book.the novel, and this tends to drag as well, again exposing another weakness of first-person: when the main character gets boring, you can't move on to somebody else.  <br />It took me a couple of weeks to read this book, where the first one just took a few days.

B00008DDXC|3.0|A bit childish, but fun. Rupert Grint (Ron Weasley) and Emma Watson (Hermione Granger) are exellent, but Daniel Radcliffe is almost expressionless in his lack of interperation of Harry Potter. If the look on his face changed at all it wasn't convincing. I began to wonder if he was only hired for the job because he looks like Potter. The boy simply can't act. Other than that the movie is wonderful and very truthful to the book.

B00000DHR0|5.0|This is not only my favorite Christmas CD, but it's one of my favorites among all of my CDs.  I can listen to this CD anytime of the year.  Celine Dion's voice is just so heavenly!  I would recommend buying this CD for the holiday season, but don't be surprised if you happen to slip it in your CD player in the middle of June.  Enjoy!
B000025XKM|5.0|Pink Moon is a very unique album, and much has been made of the circumstances under which it was recorded. But in many ways, to dwell on that is to do the album a great disservice. There is much beauty in the album, and Nick manages to acomplish a great deal with just his voice and an acoustic guitar.<BR>Each song on the album is almost perfect, but for me the two standouts are \\"Horn\\", and \\"Know\\". \\"Horn\\" is a 1 1/2 minute instrumental, but it somehow captures the very essence of what made Nick so good. It really is a beautiful piece of music. \\"Know\\", on the other hand, is a song that contains just four lines, but it somehow manages to encapsulate everything that Nick was going through at the time.<BR>Apart from one session a few months before he died, this was Nick's last attempt to record. And he certainly leaves on a high note, and despite this being seen as a 'depressing' album (In my opinion it isn't!), with the last track \\"From The Morning\\" it ends on a very optimistic note. And to these ears at least, it leaves no indication of what would eventually happen to Nick.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|After a well recieved reunion album (Brave New World) that was a good return to form for this heavy metal institution, Iron Maiden are back with it's follow up release called Dance of Death. - I will proceed to review this new album with 3 different views; How it compares to it's predecessor, back catalog, and overall quality. <br />This record (D.O.D.) totally eclipses B.N.W. in terms of freshness, originality, and songwriting. With B.N.W., Maiden played it safe in many respects. Even though it was a return to form for them (following the dreadful Virtual XI record), they could have made better use of the 3 guitar attack (harmonies, counterpoint, etc.) and branched out more with new ideas, instead of revisiting familier ones. All in all, B.N.W was the right album to for them to make at the time, and is of very high quality. D.O.D. is flowing with progressive ideas. With a band like Maiden, that has so much history, they have to keep with the elements that made them who they are. They do a fantastic job of keeping one foot in the past and one in the present. Every song rocks hard, very hard; With the exception of the last song with is an acoustic ballad called \\"Journeyman\\". They are rocking heavier than the last 3 albums put together. One can hear elements of such classic albums like Piece of Mind (Montsegur), Somewhere in Time (Rainmaker, Pachendale), Number of the Beast (Wildest Dreams, Dance of Death). While other songs explore new territory and are very progressive in nature while retaining a respect for the classic Maiden style (Gates of Tomorrow, New Frontier, Face in the Sand, Journeyman). I can now hear the 3 guitar attack and the harmonies are cleverly placed. The balance between old and new is what makes this album such a success in critical terms. Diversity is key here. Its because of this, that alot of people will have different opinions about D.O.D. - Most fans will love it though, Im sure.<br />As a musician with a trained ear and extended knowledge ofall things Maiden... I for one consider this record a resounding triumph. I thought to myself that if Maiden didn't come out with an awesome album, they could fall into the murky depths of the nostalgia act ocean. With D.O.D. they avoid that fate... I am very grateful. After listening to D.O.D. over 10 times, I have concluded that it stands up there with those masterpieces from the 80's (Seventh Son, Powerslave, Somewher in Time; in that order). Congratulations to Maiden for retaining their relevance in the new mellenium. <br />P.S. - In regards to the artwork, I think they could have done SOOOOO much better than that lame Stanley Kubrick \\"Eyes Wide Shut\\" idea. Im sorry, but those CGI characters are so cheesy (especially that stupid wolf with the baby on top) Maiden albums are known for there great themes and artwork (courtesy of Derek Riggs) and on this album, the artwork isn't even credited !!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|I picked up this cd last night. Put it in my cd player and... WOW!!! It'a REALLY F**KIN great! It's Maiden's second best album on my list. Nothing will ever take the place of BNW... but this album comes close! I've been listening to this cd no-stop for the past 24 hours! All of the 11 songs are absolutely amazing. No More Lies, Rainmaker, Dance of Death, and Age of Innocence are the best tracks. Monstegur, and Gates of Tommorow are the worst, but are still totally great. That's how great this album is. Journeyman is Maiden's first all-acoustic track, and truly great. If you buy this album for Wildest Dreams (which I doubt cause you'll never hear it on radio cause radio don't play Maiden anymore...) anyway, if you buy it for the 1st single, you'll find, that soon... You'll totally forget about it. It's forgetable compared to 4 or 5 of the other songs on the album. Paschendale and Monstegur are two war-inspired tunes that really improve the album. Paschendale is my 5th favorite on the album. It's really awesome. Face in the Sand ranks 6th, with an intro reminicent of Blood Brothers... and... OOO that intro with the double bass pedals... Oh my god thats great! New Frontier (Nicko's first writing credit) ranks 7th, but it's still incredibly awesome. No bad tracks here, just greats.<br />PICK THIS ALBUM UP! YOU'LL NEVER PUT IT DOWN!
B00009V7RF|1.0|This album can be described in two simple, clear words: PURE GARBAGE. After listening to Behind The Front, I couldn't stop and it kept getting better with Bridging The Gap (especially with the awesome lineup of guests!). Then came in Elephunk. I was so excited to listen to it after I listened to Let's Get Retarded. Guess what happened? I wanted to punch Will.I.Am in the face for making such a WACK album. I swear, they have no edge anymore, no Premier, no nothing. Except the stupid errand boy, Justin Timberlake. Do me, hip-hop...heck even Kool DJ Herc or KRS-One a favor and boycott this album!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden have always been there for the fans. Pure and simple. The band has never compromised for anyone, ever, and has reached their legendary status with little to no radio airplay and the same for video airplay. That being said, they have delivered another amazing album that all Maiden fans will absolutely love!! &quot;Dance of Death&quot; is truly a remarkable CD and is very reminiscent of earlier Maiden albums (Powerslave comes to mind). The last CD &quot;Brave New World&quot; was good but at times not quite the return to &quot;Maiden&quot; status I personally had hoped for. DOD far exceeds my expectations and is just a runaway frieght train ride straight into &quot;Eddieville&quot;!! The entire CD is what any true diehard Maiden fan would come to expect from their favorite band...(and I have been a &quot;true-believer&quot; since 1983) I have listened to it 6 times today and I can't hit the stop button...it's just on repeat!!! <br />Buy it..you won't regret it at all!!<br />Up The Irons!!
B00009TB5G|5.0|I loved the Two Towers. Of course there were changes, but there has to be in a cinematic version! I don't understand the people that say it was changed completely from the books. I've read them numerous times and I thought all in all, Peter Jackson did an incredible job! But, those others are entitled to their opinions. I personally can NOT wait for the extended version! 43 minutes of extra footage, it will be an incredible offering of 'eye candy' for the huge Tolkien fan!<br />Two Towers was great!
B00004T8RK|3.0|While \\"Yield\\" was their comeback to more seventies rock style,Pearl jam on \\"Binaural\\" has lost themself a bit.the whole album sounds like they had no real idea what atmosphere to create.even on \\"No code\\" the variety was a nice suprise,but here it is too chaotic.songs like \\"God's dice\\" are good but not as good as we could expect from pearl jam...<BR>Stone Gossard and Mike McCready are still roaring hard on guitars,Eddie's vocals are powerful so what's going on?<BR>maybe the fault is that the melodies that were so interesting on previous albums here are just normal...even there are some more pop-styled hits here (\\"light years\\")...<BR>But still like on every Pearl jam album some songs from here are simply making \\"Binaural\\" worth buying.these are marvelous \\"of the girl\\" that has a Hypnotising bluesy riff and a driving melody,rocking \\"Evecuation\\",dark ballad \\"Nothing as it seems\\" and amazing \\"Insignificance\\"...the other songs from here are a typical pearl jam stuff <BR>this is not a bad album,but the weakest ones from their rich discography.
6305657947|5.0|Pierce Brosnan plays the sly &quot;Thomas Crowne,&quot; rich business man in New York City and avid art lover.  It is not until a famous painting worth a lot of money is stolen from Crowne's favorite art museum that things get interesting.  Renee Ruso is brought in as an investigator for the insurance company in order to recover the painting.  <BR>  This is not a mystery movie.  The audience knows what is going on throughout most of the movie and there are very few &quot;surprises.&quot;  However, the character of Thomas Crowne is so cunning and sly that it is impossible not to love this movie.  It is one of my personal favorites and I recommend it to anyone.
B000003TA4|5.0|A classic rock album - if you haven't heard it you know nothing about rock.that's all.
B0000A0DS7|5.0|Usually when I first hear a band, I either like it or don't like it. And that's it. Even if I like it, it's not something I listen to constantly. It's very rare that I find a band that I can't stop listening to. Epica, however, is that band.<br />Words cannot explain how incredible this album is. The atmosphere portrayed on this opus is beyond imagination. The Phantom Agony has probably the best vocals ever heard on an album. You'll start by hearing Simone's voice (Might I add: she's got the most beautiful voice I've ever heard in my life.), then comes the sound of a full choir singing in harmony. It gives this album a whole other dimension that you won't hear on most other metal albums.<br />Mind you, Epica doesn't create anything entirely new, but they take what you think of &quot;gothic metal&quot; to a whole different level. Many bands have mixed classical music in, but Epica pulls it off perfectly, and the classical influence is undeniable. The best phrase to describe this is &quot;Opera metal&quot;.<br />So, if you're still reading this review, you're wasting your time when you could be out buying and listening to The Phantom Agony... truly a masterpiece and a cornerstone for the future of metal. And I don't see them wearing out their welcome any time in the future.
B00004XONN|2.0|Once i read that Radiohead owns the title of the best band in the world...\\"Kid a\\" sold in miloins of copies around the world (even in Usa).who the hell are they to call them the best band in hte world? the whole record is not as impressive as i have expected.i listened before to \\"Ok computer\\" and \\"Bends\\" that were a good albums with some magnificent songs but the whole albums weren't as impressive.<BR>\\"Kid a\\" is a post-avantgarde album with a bit of standard rock sounds...the thing is Radiohead is so popular because of their sudden moves - after smash hit \\"Ok computer\\" they made an avantgarde record - no videos,no promotion but also no such a good songs.after they did it milions of people bought it and were talking that it's great and amrvelous although they didn;t really knew why - the critics were telling it and the nation was buying then repeating the praising words.Wake up!<BR>Radiohead is creating a rich and interesting sundscapes in some songs - best examples are \\"Idioteque\\",\\"Kid a\\" and \\"Everything in the right place\\".and these are the only good tracks from here.the rest is a mix of cheesy ballads,annoying experiments (\\"National anthem\\" - a good song ruined by extremly irritating horn section) and wierd things...Thom Yorke has a interesting voice but he is far from other british-rock singers.<BR>Radiohead is a quintet band - the whole album could be done in 2 (maybe 3) persons squad...<BR>generally - overrated,boring,irritating,BAD.a major dissapointment
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Alot of people have been giving Maiden's 13th studio release alot of guff, and its just not right. This CD rules big time. The only problem I have with it is the cover is ridiculous. <BR>Wildest Dreams-The only song on the CD that doesnt really do it for me, and its the single. This song is just too by the books to be a Maiden classic.<BR>Rainmaker-Great track, i love that riff that starts it out. A fun song that will become a favorite.<BR>No More Lies-Starts off slow with that cool lick, then gets intense later on. One of my favorites on the album.<BR>Montsegur-Classic Maiden. Cant wait to hear them play this cut live. <BR>Dance of Death-Might be the best song on the album. Nice orchestral riff raff going on in the background. The best part is  the solo that turns orchestral. Such a well written cut.<BR>Gates of tomorrow-Pretty good song. Beginning reminds me of From Here to Eternity. Nothing to write home about.<BR>New Frontier-Awesome song. Nicko McBrain tries his writing chops  on another contender for best song on the album.<BR>Paschendale-Great battle song, though I dont agree with people who say it could be the next Aces High. I remember reading on the website when they were mixing the Cd that it would feature cannons going off and battlecries and stuff, and i think the song would be better if they kept all that, dont know why they ended cutting it out.<BR>Face in the Sand-Another unbelievable cut. I dont know how they did it.<BR>Age of Innocence-Ive said it a few times, but this is probably my favorite song. Great chorus, i love the orchestra mamba jamba and this song rules.<BR>Journeyman-A very slow and moving song from Maiden. Great album closer.<br />This disc rules, maiden still [is great] after all these years ... Maiden is better than anything out there.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Dance of Death is a pivotal album for Iron Maiden.  They must keep the momentum going from the huge comeback album Brave New World.  For a band that has been around as long as Maiden the temptation may be to try something completely different.  In the case of DOD, all of the Maiden trademarks are there but with some subtle additions.  First off, the most interesting thing is the diversity in the songwriting.  This appears to be much more a collaborative  than in the past.  Steve Harris has actually deigned to let the rest of the band in on the creative process.  Even Nicko has a credit!  The result is that the musical themes go in many directions.  Most impressive is that there are actually acoustic numbers and orchestral arrangements included to liven up the sound.  I have listened to the album in it's entirety only once, so I anticipate that it will grow on me in time, but it seems Maiden has another winner on there hands.  My only dissapointment is that with Bruce and Adrian in the band, they have failed to take things in an ultra-heavy direction like Bruce has done on his solo albums.  Up the irons!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|It's fantastic!!!<BR>The best album since Seventh Son of a Seventh Son!!!<BR>All the musics are very good!!!<BR>Buy now, I recomend.

0062502174|5.0|I read this book six months ago and decided what the hell.  I packed all my stuff up, said my goodbyes and took a step on the path of my destiny.  Oh dear friends, much has changed and I could tell you some stories.  This book to some discerning eyes may have a less-than-stellar plot and happenstance aplenty.  But listen to the message! Without giving too much away, this book is like the title says, following your dreams.  You will most likely argue that if we all got up and decided to find out what we are meant to do on this Earth, there would be no janitors and burger flippers.  But there are some people who work in high paying, high responsibility jobs who would find more happiness and freedom pushing a broom than having their lips on their bosses' rear just for the nice parking space.  Also, some people even after reading this book will not follow the message and continue to choose to be miserable. Just know that if you are not happy where you are at this moment, take a journey toward what you want to do.  You want to be a pilot, do it.  You want to work on cars, do it.  You want to paint, do it.  If you are not happy, God is trying to tell you something.  Don't be afraid.  Trust me on this.
0060977493|3.0|Arundathi Roy took a long time over this book.  What she has ended up with is a technically excellent novel, winner of the Booker prize, written in exquisite flowing prose which is coloured by Malayalam and the influences of children.<br />It is a story of a love affair that could not be, a child who should not have died, a man who should not have been killed and twins who should not have been separated.  This tale sits within the larger tapestry woven by a Syrian Christian family living in Kerala in India, tracing their lives from the backwards walking days of the British Raj to the present culture of daytime talkshows and world wrestling.<br />The main story is told in tantalising glimpses and teasing passages, laid out like a detective novel, with clues all along the way.  So when you get to the end, you know what happened, but still, you want the actors to play out their final scenes, just to be sure.<br />But at the end of the book I felt, yes, good story, beautiful language, and yet.....it all feels so managed.  As though Roy set out not to write a heartfelt story, but that from the beginning she intended it as a piece of crafted literature, something the critics would rave about.  Like the Kathkali dancer in her tale, who compromises his art to entertain bored tourists, I feel always that this story was pruned for display and in the process lost much of its passion.
B0000524CY|5.0|Thirty years after it's release, THE EXORCIST remains the scariest film of all-time.  Adapted by William Peter Blatty from his own novel, this legendary horror flick follows the difficulties of a mother (Ellen Burstyn) whose 12-year-old girl (Linda Blair, in her biggest performance) becomes possessed by the devil, and how the mother discovers that the only way to save her daughter is an exorcism.  There is frightening directing by William Friedkin (THE FRENCH CONNECTION), a very short by haunting score by Jack Nitzsche, and great performances by Burstyn, Blair, Jason Miller, Lee J. Cobb and Max von Sydow.  To add to that, there's horrifyingly realistic special effects (by Marcel Vercoutere) and eerie cinematography (by Owen Roizman).  Now we also have &quot;The Version You've Never Seen&quot; - which, hopefully you have seen, because it includes ten minutes of new, terrifying footage.  Once you've seen, the film's hundreds of ghastly images will never leave your mind.  Simply put, THE EXORCIST will live on to horrify us for generations to come.
B000058T5E|5.0|There are days when your heart is broken and your soul discouraged you are uncertain how to go on for another day.  Every decade or so, an extraordinary piece of music comes along that can stand up to such extreme emotional distress, fill up the seemingly bottomless void and satisfy the need of a tattered mind.  (A very loud and confused piece of music may help you numb and forget some of the pain, but it eventually is a sad and sordid remedy that would last only momentarily.)<br />This CD's fifth song, Nadia, is just such a rare piece of music.  It is so complex as to engage your mind totally, and yet it is ultimately so very simple and beautiful.  It is subtle but robust.  It is tranquil but stirring.  Sad but uplifting.  It is demented, lyrical.<br />It is also a triumph of guitar virtuosity -- without the flaunting of the guitaristic skills exercised.  Somehow Jeff Beck has succeeded in making some of his earlier masterpieces (Cause We Ended as Lovers, Diamond Dust etc.) sound childish by comparison.<br />Jeff Beck did not write Nadia.  (Nitin Sawhney did.)  But that does not take away from his accomplishment; he has made this music so much his own.  After all, interpretation of others' work (Mingus's Good By Pork Pie Hat, for example, not to mention the works by Jan Hammer) is where Jeff Beck's genius lies.<br />Obviously, Nadia is worth much more than the price of this CD.
B00004U8JU|4.0|Who hasn't heard of JURASSIC PARK?  While ranking among the top of the highest-grossing films list, it also brought Spielberg back into the spotlight (as did the same year's SCHINDLER'S LIST) and surpassed any special effect previously filmed.  JURASSIC PARK, which was very loosely adapted from the best-seller by Michael Crichton, follows a group of scientists who successfully clone dinosaurs for a theme park - from there, of course, everything goes haywire.  Sam Neill and Laura Dern are two paleontologists who unexpectingly end up as advisors to the park; Jeff Goldblum is the advising mathematician; and Richard Attenborough is the child-like owner and creator of the park.  Neill is especially good and would later appear in JURASSIC PARK III; Goldblum is funny and would later appear in THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, the first sequel.  Spielberg's directing is very good, but unfortunately not some of his best; the thrilling screenplay is by Michael Crichton (from his novel) and David Koepp; then there's one of John Williams' greatest scores.  Of course, the true highlights of the film are the dinosaurs; they are some of the most realistic special effects ever seen in cinema (those effects would later be surpassed in JURASSIC PARK III).  JURASSIC PARK certainly doesn't rank among Williams' best, but it's an exciting film and a landmark in the special effects industry.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|When Iron Maiden hit the 90s everything went wrong 4 them.  The absolute s*** No Prayer for the Dying was released and the departure of Adrian Smith didnt exactly help matters and later when Bruce left, all looked lost.  But then when Brave New World hit the stores the world couldnt belive it the worlds greatest metal band were back and Brave New World was a towering reaffirmation of Maidens dominace over lesser peers.  Metallica were entered into the Kerrang! Hall of Fame, even when St. Anger was one of the worst possible albums to be released this year.  However Messrs Bruce Steve Adrian Dave Nicko and Janick return to save the world yet again from bad metal.<br />Wildest Dreams 9/10 A great solid song by Maiden with a killer video.  However at first listen it seems to be the worst song on the album, and thats saying A LOT a killer chorus combined with breakneck verses make this a good strong opener<br />Rainmaker 9.75/10 Would have been one of Maidens greatest songs but 4 the poor lyrical structure this only gets a 9.5 but a great tune and strong riff make this an unmissable song<br />No More Lies 12/10 ONE OF THE GREATEST MAIDEN SONGS EVER!!!!  a massive riff gives way to one of the finest chorus' ever recorded and the solos by all the merry men are FANTASTIC!!!  Sir Harris really outdid himself one this one a fine fine fine FINE song nothing goes wrong for this one and every single guitarist does a huge job prolly one of the top 5 maiden songs of all time<br />Montsegur 9/10 Pales in comparison with the mighty No More Lies, but by no means bad, very melodic with a huge sounding wall of guitars definately holds its own against any other song on this album<br />Dance Of Death 10/10 A Typical Steve Harris epic right until the great moment when the strings are added in to the riff melodic long and huge sounding, complete with extremely odd lyrics....<br />Gates Of Tomoroww 9/10 When first heard this sounds like a generic Maiden rock out but on closer examination, its a bombardment of massive riffs coupled to a great chorus and finished off with some fine percussive bluster that only Nicko and Steve can pull off<br />New Frontier 9.25/10 Nickos first ever writing credit, and not a bad song at all with an interesting if slightly familiar riff to it, but a good chorus and excellent musicianship make this a song worth checking out, I also didnt like this song till about the 3rd listen so I guess it has to grow on u for a bit<br />Paschendale 11/10 Another amazing epic kicking off with a strange hi hat beat but when the eerie guitar comes in u know this ones gonna be a classic.  Bruce is on top form in this song, and the chorus is yet again one of the greatest that Maiden have written.  Steve and Adrian really outdid themselves on this one, you can almost feel the blood and guts of No Mans Land in WW1, haunting, desolate and rightly so<br />Face In The Sand 11/10 And you thought Paschendale was great.  This major epic takes a while to get off the ground, but when the chorus hits you know that this song is a blessing to this album.  I imagine this will be a hell of a song live, a showstopper indeed, with this Iron Maiden leave all the competiton's, er, Face in the Sand<br />Age of Innocence 7.5/10 A poor follow up to Face in the Sand and Paschendale, but hey, you cant have good things all the time can you, a slightly dreary chorus which should have been one of the greatest chorus' Maidens ever done turned and fell belly down, but thankfully it isnt the last Track coz that would have been a terrible way to round off this quite fabulous CD<br />Journeyman 10/10 Best Maiden Acoustic song, come to think of it there are only like 2 but journeyman picks off right where Face in the Sand left off with glorious strings, a mighty chorus and absolute proof that Iron Maiden rule Once and for All<br />F**king amazing, this is Heavy Metal in all its glory, quite simply the best album done by Maiden since 7th Son.  Iron Maiden can turn the new millenium into their most glorious years and they have with Dance of Death which beats the cr*p out of Brave New World(which was fantastic btw).  O Well.  Get those Horns Out.  UP THE IRONS!!
B00004U8JV|3.0|Out of all of Steven Spielberg's many films, THE LOST WORLD: JURASSIC PARK, the sequel to the blockbuster megahit, is for certain the master director's worst.  It details a team sent to bring back Sarah Harding (Julianne Moore) from a Site B containing more dinosaurs, while another team is sent to capture the dinosaurs and bring them back to L.A.  Jeff Goldblum stars as Ian Malcom, the humorous mathematician from the first film, who knows right from wrong - he just can't get anyone to listen to him.  The special effects are again excellent, and Williams' score is very good, but when it's a Steven Spielberg film and it gets nowhere above average, you can't help but feel extremely disappointed.  Featuring almost no relation to the novel from it was adapted by Michael Crichton.  Next up: JURASSIC PARK III.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|this album kicks [butt] from start to finish. it follows in the footsteps of brave new world but evens goes further than that record did. even more epic sounding if you can imagine it. my favs are pashendale, dance of death and journeyman. special attention is given to journeyman. this song closes the album and it is soft and sweet with sweeping string arrangements. it is acoustic but it retains that \\"maiden writing\\" trademark. this album does not deviate from maiden's traits. time changes, guitar harmonies and epic mood changes. nicko mcbrain also gets in his first song ever called new frontier. and it kicks [butt] too. killer album. if you are a maiden or a fan of metal in general check it out.
0783231032|3.0|1941 is Steven Spielberg's most infamous flop.  The film is one of Spielberg's very few comedies, chronicling the adventures of a group of citizens and soldiers in 1941 California, who fear they'll be next.  Spielberg's directing is nothing special, an extremely rare occurence; Robert Zemeckis' and Bob Gale's script has some of the most unfunny circumstances made into attempted comedy; John Williams' score is great, but as with Spielberg, nothing great; there's also some wacky cinematography by William A. Fraker.  Some of the main members of an outstanding cast include Dan Aykroyd, Ned Beatty, Christopher Lee, Tim Matheson, Murray Hamilton, Lorraine Gary, Robert Stack, Treat Williams, Warren Oates, and Slim Pickens.  Of course, the true highlight of the film is John Belushi, who never lets us down for laughs.  As a matter of fact, Belushi may be the only good part of the film in his role as a crazed war pilot.  While true war historians and the like may think that the occurences upon which the film is inspired are nothing to be made fun of (I myself feel the same), 1941 isn't a total waste, as unfunny as it is.  Bottom line: Good moments, but only for those who have seen everything else Spielberg has to offer.
B000021YQV|5.0|I am a huge System of a Down fan. I have all their albums and eps as well as Serart and Kittens for Christian. But, I am also a huge metal fan. I can honestly say that this is hands down, one of the top 5 (at least) metal albums of our time!! <br />Serj is one of the most amazing poets that transferred over to music, because his lyrics are honest-to-god opinions and his voice can carry into a wide variety of tones. Daron is my idol and rightfully so; he is an extremely great guitarists and has the attitude that music is fun and not a obstacle on the way to success. Shavo and John are technical wizards and have a great repore with each other. <br />If the singles, Toxicity, Aerials and Chop Suey aren't enough to spark your interest, than Deer Dance, Science and Forest should give you a good enough reason. Any metal fan should have this album in their collection or they're missing out. Rap fans will also like Serj's rap-style versing as well. This will not be a purchase you'll forget.
B0000AMRJC|4.0|If you know the whole story behind SCARFACE, then let me sum up this entire review for you: SCARFACE is a classic and is not to be missed - it does, indeed, come extremely close to being a masterpiece.  Loosely remade from the 1932 film of the same name, Al Pacino stars as the title character, a Cuban refugee who takes over a drug empire in 1980's Florida.  When first released in 1983, SCARFACE turned off many of it's viewers when they saw that (at that time) SCARFACE held the record for the use of the \\"f\\"-word.  The film that later took up the record, CASINO, is very similar to this film, in that they both center around a man with nothing who gets everything and then looses it because of his greed.  Brian De Palma's directing isn't exactly wonderful; Pacino's performance, however, is as the angered Tony Montana.  There's also an excellent score by Giorgio Moroder, and a nifty little 80's soundtrack.  SCARFACE may not be a masterpiece, but it's a cult classic and a true must-see for film fanatics.  \\"Say hello to my little friend!\\"
B0000A36J5|5.0|We loved this movie, yes Preciousss. Our favorite character finally in it *gollum gollum*. When we first saw the movie, we were disappointed at first that Gollum's face was so human, but after the first scene, preciousss, we loves it! Andy Serkis deserved a \\"Best Supporting Actor\\" oscar. Yes yes! But it wasn't exaclty like the book, but who cares? Not us! All the important items left out will surely be included in the next movie, so quit worrying, preciouss! Yes. Poor poor Smagol. Nice fish.
0385504209|1.0|\\"The Da Vinci Code\\" is a fast-paced page-turner.  Though by adult literary standards, the book is fairly weak, it should serve as a great start for young people interested in the adventure of European history.  I sincerely applaud that.<br />Unfortunately Brown and his editors made the choice to preface the book with specific claims concerning \\"Fact\\" and \\"Accuracy.\\"  This was a strange decision.  Mr. Brown's interpretations are his own business, but he is swearing that the basic facts on documents and art objects are correct.  As has already been shown in \\"The New York Times\\" and others, this is unquestionably untrue.  The book has more factual holes in it than a mound of Swiss (Secret Bank Account) Cheese.  Are we then to assume that Mr. Brown and his publishers are simply incompetent, or were they knowingly dishonest.  If someone sells me a painting they say is real but turns out to be a forgery, it is a crime.  Here an author and publisher have made tens of millions of dollars peddling a book to millions of people, to a large degree because they claim it is based on controversial but accurate information.  Now that much of that basic information is turning out to be false, isn't that a clear-cut case of fraud?  No accusations here, just an honest question.<br />I hold a MA degree from an Ivy League school and have lived in Europe for many years.  I am concerned about how much deceit I see in American culture these days.  I, for one, will be trying not to buy books from Doubleday in the future.  I hope Mr. Brown continues to serve up his platters of fun for young people, but I hope very much that he and his publishers decide to retract their false claims to accuracy.  Besides, my experience has been that the truth (or at least an honest attempt based on current research) about a number of the areas Brown touches on is much more interesting than the tired myths and legends he serves up here, albeit in a zippy new package.
0375703861|5.0|A big, rich novel, touching on friendships, marriage, teenage angst, Jehovah's Witnesses, Muslims and love. Very well written with much humor. The unlikely friendship between Archie Jones, a red-headed Englishman, and Samad Iqbal, a Bengali Muslim, is followed, along with the lives of their families. Shows how family problems are universal. Characters are well-shaped. Zadie Smith is an expert at the characterization of teenagers - she nails them. This is a wonderful, wonderful book.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|In one word: worth! I was anxious for this one. The single, &quot;Wildest Dreams&quot;, sounds preety happy on the first couple of spins. But then it grew on you showing the usual Maiden trademarks. After a while you just can't stop moving when you hear it. Rainmaker, song #2, is as good or even better as any song from the 7th Son/Somewhere in Time era. Quality Maiden music. &quot;No More Lies&quot; comes next and closes this trio of very good opening songs. Than the music gets a little monotonous, slow - even somewhat commercial. Bruce's voice on the mid tracks is below expectations, as is the whole mixing of the album. But let me stress again: the first three songs are enough for making any Maiden fan more than happy.

6304711921|5.0|Simply the best animated movie ever... A must have and a must see. It is incredible on DVD. It was like the first time I saw it in the movie theater...
B0000AGQ6Z|3.0|&quot;Lawrence of Arabia&quot; is the sweeping, grand and brilliantly conceived fictional account of the life of T.E. Lawrence.  The plot follows Lawrence from his modest beginnings as a somewhat backward British officer, to his rise as a cult figure and finally, his downward spiral and death.  In his debut film, Peter O'Toole delivers a tour de force performance. Omar Shariff is ideally cast as Ali.  The evergreen chameleon, Alec Guinness is marvelous.  Claude Raines and Jack Hawkins are their usual stellar best.<br />THE TRANSFER: Film restorer, Robert A. Harris was called back in to color correct the original restoration negative he had previously worked on.  The result is a much smoother, more vibrant print of this immortal classic that truly exhibits the film's rich texture.  <br />Unfortunately, Columbia (after promising that they would remove it) has left in all of the previous edge enhancement that was contained on the orginal DVD transfer.  Fine details shimmer excessively.  Much of the latter half of the film is plagued by an incredibly large amount of edge enhancement that creates harsh halo effects around much of the background information.  These effects are terribly distracting. <br />Despite Superbit's claim to offer the best picture quality available to the home consumer - this disc simply does not hold up! Also, the break in the film DOES NOT come at the intermission, where one might expect it.  While the Superbit doctrine claims this is in order to preserve the integrity of the image quality, it's really hard to take them serious when DVD transfers like &quot;Hello Dolly!&quot; have their full 144 min. running time crammed onto one side of a disc with no discernable traces of edge enhancement or shimmering included!<br />The audio has been corrected and, for the most part, sounds wonderful - but, on occasion - particularly during the duped segments - where before the over all characteristic was strident, it is now muffled instead (improvement? - you decide).   <br />Extras: Nothing of course - this is Superbit, what did you expect?<br />BOTTOM LINE: Mr. Harris has my deepest admiration for his restorative efforts on this disc. However, the edge enhancement on &quot;Lawrence&quot; is a visual blemish I am not willing to overlook, precisely because it is NOT limited to a few scenes but plagues the transfer throughout and distracts from all the hard efforts Mr. Harris has put forth on this disc. Columbia has my greatest disdain!
B00009W0U4|1.0|I did not even finish watching this movie it was so bad. I can appreciate a violent, twisted film and enjoy them very much but this movie was horrible. It disturbing and boring at the same time. The rape scene in this film is the worst I have ever seen and was hard not to turn the film off then. I would recommend this movie to noone.
0425170349|4.0|I loved Rainbow Six because it added the realism that I love about Tom Clancy, but I gave this novel 4 stars because he messed up on one little thing. <BR> That thing being is that one of the charatchers Tom Clancy is referring to, is that he was born to a Chinese father and a Latino mother. <BR> One...when you are referring to a woman who has Latin blood in her, you dont call her a Latino, she is a Latina. Second Latina's dont date Asian's or Germans, they only go out with black's and other Latino's. <BR> But beyond that, this is a GOOD novel, the action is there, and this is one of his best novels, I just wish that Red Rabbit had the same action like Rainbow Six does. <BR> I also liked the charatcher Domingo Chavez, and another thing when his son was born, he named him John Connor Chavez. One other thing; A Latino man does not name his son John Connor Chavez or any other name that is not referring to his Latin roots. <BR> Latin men who have kids want their kids to have Latin names and for a Latino man to name his son John Connor Chavez is just out of the picture.
031286504X|3.0|I liked this ground breaking vampire novel.  I also liked the artwork on this latest edition.  But I just wanted the novel by itself!<br />The other stories are good but I hated them being in the book!  This should not be a short story collection.  I am nit picking but I didn't want that stuff in this book.<br />It's weird to think of the characters in this book living in 1950's Los Angeles County.  They even name actual streets that still exist!  Like in places like Compton and Inglewood.  Which are really bad gangland areas.  They have some nice areas there, yes, but they are pretty ghetto these days.  Hard to believe they were once nice suburbs.  Before the REAL vampires and bloodsuckers moved in.  The gangs.  And what does one of those gangs called themselves?  The Bloods!  Ha!  Unreal.<br />Matheson was right that violent hordes of bloodthirsty monsters were invading the suburbs of the once beautiful Los Angeles County.  More than he realized.  Is the book an allegory for what happened to this once decent area?  Are the vampires symbols for the invading hordes of lowlife thugs and degenerates who were invading and destroying a good place?  And all the law abiding, good citizens of the area fled or came to violent ends?<br />Food for thought to be sure!  Or it could just be a decent vampire story.  Read the book, enjoy it, and maybe take a drive through the L.A. neighborhoods mentioned in the book.  But stay out at night.  That's when the vampires come out.
0451169514|5.0|My friend gave me the orginal hardcover of IT when I turned 18, and once I read IT, I could not put it down. Yes IT is long; in hardcover 1,138 pages LONG, in paperback; IT is 1,080 pages.<BR> Now the story is GREAT! This is horror at it's BEST!<BR>The story takes place in a Maine town in 1958 and 1985, and it takes you through their adventures during 1958 and 1985, and it just keeps you glued to the story, and IT's long, but I was NEVER bored with it non what so EVER! <BR> The charatchers are great, and the whole adventure to find this ancient evil lurking in the sewers is amazing, and to add, this is not a book to be missed. <BR> A lot of critics dont like this novel because it is too long, but dont listen to them, in order for you to understand IT, you have to buy IT, and be prepared to be scared!
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Good: no more lies, gates of tomorrow, age of innocence, Journeyman<br />Classic maiden.  There were a few songs I'd consider filler, but about half the album was eminitely listenable.  Gotta have it if you're a Maiden fan.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|What a joke.<BR> I was waiting 3 years for the new album and what a disappointment it turned out to be. Bruce has lost his voice, probably from too much touring after Brave New World. Brave New World is an excellent album - a true comeback. Dance with Death is not even close to be in the same league.<BR>There are five albums with 5 stars: Piece of Mind, Powerslave, Somewhere in Time, 7 Son of the 7 Son and Brave New World.
B000002UA9|5.0|1963's &quot;Please Please Me&quot; was the album that started it all for the world's most beloved band of all-time, The Beatles, and the music world would be forever changed. An outstanding 33 minutes of pure rock 'n' roll fun, the album was recorded in a single day, with John Lennon, Paul McCartney, George Harrison &amp; Ringo Starr blasting through their live repertoire of originals &amp; cover songs as quickly as producer George Martin could record them. Lennon/McCartney originals such as &quot;I Saw Her Standing There,&quot; &quot;Please Please Me,&quot; &quot;Love Me Do,&quot; and &quot;Do You Want To Know A Secret&quot; are all immortal Beatles classics, but the group also had the magical gift of making anyone else's song they covered totally their own, such as &quot;Anna (Go To Him),&quot; &quot;Boys&quot; (featuring Ringo's debut lead vocal), &quot;Baby It's You,&quot; and, last but definitely not least, the Fab Four's barnburning treatment of &quot;Twist And Shout.&quot; Great songs, classic vocals &amp; harmonising, Lennon &amp; Harrison's jangly guitars, McCartney's strong bass-playing, and Ringo's slap-happy drumming, it's all here on &quot;Please Please Me.&quot; Has it really been *40 years* since the Fab Four made this classic album? It hasn't aged one bit. I've always wondered what the music world would've been like had the Beatles never come around. Thank God they did with &quot;Please Please Me.&quot;
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Iron Maiden has not lost one step. Over 25 years and still going strong. Bass, drum and three, yes THREE guitars play off each other so well with a melody that few bands could even come close to matching, vocals that don't show any sign of fading, lyrics that continue in the Iron Maiden tradition of great imagination and great stories. They give everything they can in their music and their live shows, never putting out anything that could be considered inferior quality.<br />With all the bad music and bands that all sound the same its good to find a band that stands out and doesn't change their sound just to sell albums. True to their roots, never slowing or giving in to the talk about &quot;getting old&quot;, a true pioneer in metal proving again why millions of fans can't be wrong for listening.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|After 22 years and 12 albums, Iron Maiden has proved that they are just as strong creatively and musically as they ever were.  &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; is the band's 13th album and the follow-up to 2000's highly successful &quot;Brave New World&quot; album, which marked the return of vocalist Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith.  Unlike so many bands, Maiden has proved that they have a staying power that most bands only dream of while staying true to their sound all the way.  Even among their still popular contemporaries, Maiden proves that they are still the reigning legends of metal.  For those who were disgusted with Metallica's &quot;St. Anger&quot; album released earlier this year, &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; should be a relief.  Maiden has always seemed to have a 'don't fix it if it isn't broke' attitude towards their music, and it has paid off every time.  &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; has everything you expect from a Maiden album; the galloping rhythms, the burning guitar solos, and the memorable melodies that have become a signature of the band.  In terms of sound, the album lies somewhere between &quot;Brave New World&quot; and &quot;Piece Of Mind&quot; with a few elements of &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; mixed in.  &quot;Dance Of Death&quot; is a much heavier album than it's predecessor &quot;Brave New World,&quot; and the triple guitar attack of Dave Murray, Adrain Smith, and Janick Gers is used brilliantly here.  Maiden has created another album that fits nicely next to their other albums, but the band breaks some new ground with this one.  Here is a quick track rundown:  <br />WILDEST DREAMS--The first single released for the album is quite similar to &quot;The Wicker Man&quot; from &quot;Brave New World&quot; with it's crunchy guitar riff and catchy chorus.  Adrian knocks out another memorable solo.<br />RAINMAKER--A great rocker with another instantly memorable chorus and great use of the guitar trio.  This one is sure to be a favorite.<br />NO MORE LIES--The only song on the album written entirely by bassist Steve Harris.  A mellow opening similar to the one on &quot;The Clansman&quot; breaks into a shout-along chorus.  Once again, great guitar work from the guitar trio.<br />MONTSEGUR--A powerful guitar riff opens this catchy song.  Slightly familiar to &quot;The Fallen Angel&quot; from &quot;Brave New World.&quot;<br />DANCE OF DEATH--The title track shows Steve Harris writing some of his most vivid and graphic lyrics.  Great use of the guitar trio.<br />GATES OF TOMORROW--A track that sounds very slightly similar to some of the more memorable material from Bruce Dickinson's &quot;Skunkworks&quot; CD.<br />NEW FRONTIER--A first for drummer Nicko McBrain.  After 20 years with the band, he has finally co-written his first song on a Maiden album!  Written along with Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, this one has another chorus that you will find yourself singing along to by the end of the song.  <br />PASCENDALE--An epic war song that begins with a quiet guitar figure and breaks into a heavy hitting rocker.<br />FACE IN THE SAND--Opening similar to the title track, this one slowly builds with intensity.  This song has subtle echoes of elements of Maiden's &quot;Fear Of The Dark&quot; album.  A sing along melody leads the song out.<br />THE AGE OF INNOCENCE--The heavy riffs of the verse are broken by a smooth chorus that will grab your ear immediatly.  <br />JOURNEYMAN--A song that will silence the critics that say that Maiden doesn't change their sound enough.  &quot;Journeyman&quot; is a song with no electric guitars, thundering drums, or galloping bass lines.  This one is an acoustic ballad (yes I said ballad) with a string section playing in the back and vocals from Bruce Dickinson that are nothing less than beautiful.  Rounding off an already brilliant album, &quot;Journeyman&quot; is perhaps the best track on the record.<br />Maiden has done it again.
B00005BKZJ|5.0|Reviewed and summed up well by others, I'll just add that from a truck enthusiast's perspective, this movie contains bonus footage and sounds of a tidy Barstow Cat-powered peterbilt and GM-powered 4070 International, plus background shots of various highway rigs and freight trains.<br />A wonderful movie
B000066NW0|5.0|The Avril Lavigne Debut Album &quot;Let Go&quot; for me was the best cd ive ever bought i bought it on the day it came out and im still listening to it like i just bought it, Avril is the only artist that i can never get sick of shes the best!!!<br />I love her lots and lots and lots!!!
B0000BYM3K|1.0|Im 27 years old,im listening to Maiden since i was like 16...this is by far the worst Maiden album ever,even more (i can't believe im saying this)then the ones with Blaze....every Maiden album since i was 16 the first time i heard a song it was clicking right away..the moment i knew this Dance of Death isn't clicking i gave it another try...still nothing....the sound is good,guitars are awesome....but the songs themselves just su**..and what is this last track?? oh my god!!! sounds like a slow song from a Dickinson solo projects.<BR>awful album!<BR>Better wait another 3 years.<BR>Up the Irons.
B00006879E|5.0|I'm not going to get into every song because that would take too long.  In a nutshell, I'm a rock radio dj, and I get tired of music--fast!!  Most days, I listen to talk radio, or nothing at all, just to get a break.<br />There aren't many cds I can say this about, but I can listen to this one again and again from start to finish and I never seem to tire of it.  I think I can say that maybe about 2 or 3 other cds.  There's not one bad song on this disc, which is impressive.  I find it very Lenny Kravtiz-esque...funky, great hooks, great riffs, very catchy tunes.
B000003TA4|4.0|Very good music. I mean, how much can you say about music, especially when everyone has different tastes? But, as far as I'm concerned, its great music. Just like you probably are, I' bought this CD only for Smells Like Teen Spirit, but I found myself liking all of them excpet Polly and Something in the Way.
B000002GFC|5.0|If you could only have one Cream CD, this should be it.  This is a must-have in building your all-around classic rock collection and your 60s psychedelic/acid rock collection in particular. Why buy several CDs that have a lot of songs you don't want, need or like to get the goodies?
B00005OAIE|5.0|Room for Squares is the latest in the new trend of singer/songwriter albums.  But John Mayer is not the typical great singer/horrible writter or vice versa.  This CD has it all, from enthusiastic lyrics in the pseudo love song &quot;City Love,&quot; to a heart wrenching tale in &quot;Why Georgia.&quot;  His words scream out to all young college women, I'm sensitive and I can treat you right.  The voice of young John Mayer is just as warm and distinguishable as all of his songs, and he does not fail in his delivery on any of the fourteen tracks.
B000003TAB|5.0|I was floored when I first herd this cd. It just kicks ...! I will say this, it's not for everyone and is an aquired taste. Give it more then one listen, and you'll ither be hooked or turned off. As for me, it is one hell of a work out cd. I know weard but that's just me.
B00000ILDF|5.0|Alien 3 is one of my favorite movies!  A lot of Alien fans hate it.  Why?  It's a heck of a lot better then the other three.  Aliens is probably the overall favorite, but it's too long and not that scarry considering there are hundereds of aliens.  It all stars out when Ripley, Bishop, Hicks, and Newt crash land on Furry 161.  It is a security prison planet full of inmates.  It may sound bad, but it's really good.  A dog gets impreagnanted and there is a new bigger alien that can crawl on walls and the ceiling.  The inmates , except for one, don't know about the alien before Brian Glover's character gets killed in front of everyone.  Ripley's plan to destroy the alien by trapping the alien backFIRES when the fire is accidently lit early which kills off about 10 prisoners.  Dillon, who is played by Chareles S. Dutton, has the idea by drowning the alien in lead.  The plan woked..... for a while.<BR>The survivor of the movie may not be your faveorite, but it was great and my favorite guy died too.<BR>Alien 3- Overall grade: 104% A+<BR>Begining: 17/20 Alien action early<BR>Plot:     18/20 Any other ideas?<BR>Alien:    20/20 A job well done!<BR>Acting:   19/20 Weaver, Dutton, and Dance were great!<BR>Ending:   20/20 Can it get any get any better!?!<BR>Bonus:    +10 For great alien FX and scenes!
B00005N5S5|5.0|This movie is awesome. Schwarzenegger is cast perfectly as a motionless cyborg. Mike Biehn plays as Kyle Reese who is Sarah Connor's (Linda Hamilton) personal bodyguard and lover. The story starts in the year 2029, where machines have taken over the world. To save the human cause, members of the resistance send back a lone warrior (Biehn) to protect Sarah Connor who's son is to become a leader of the rebels. The machines send back the T-800 series terminator to assassinate Sarah Connor. Then the fun starts. In this movie the Terminator ends the lives of at least 40 people. The best scene is the battle royale inside the TechNoir Club between Reese and the T-800 mid way through the movie.

B00008PC2O|5.0|This DVD is one of the ten best ever! The original T2 was great but this one was awesome! The added special features add more! The deleted scenes were great. Especially the one where Reese comes back from the dead and tells Sarah that John is the target. If there is any DVD that is an awesome buy, this is definitely it!
B00006HB4E|2.0|I am not going to waste a large amount of time here.  This movie was bad on so many levels that I can only say if you were thinking of renting it, or worse, buying it, your money will also work well as kindling at the next family cookout. <br />&quot;Gremlins 2&quot; is a completely non-linear sequel to the successful &quot;Gremlins.&quot;  Although much of the cast is the same, their characters aren't, and they are completely non-dimensional, present only for consistency from the first film.  The story is set in New York, inside one of the massive skyscrapers there.  Gizmo returns in this film, orphaned by the death of his owner and friend, the elderly chinese man who owned a junk shop in Chinatown, to Billy, his sometime friend from the first film.  As with before, he gets wet, births a new batch of Mogwais, and it isn't long before they spawn into Gremlins, releasing havoc on New York.<br />The movie is filled with a bunch of visual &quot;sthick&quot;, which attempts to be funny, but comes across as ridiculous, stupid and very contrived.  There are no characters worth caring about or beliving in, and by the end of the movie, when the Gremlins are about to escape, you hope they will, if to devour the production staff that made this piece of garbage.

B000024QML|5.0|Neil Tennant and Chris Lowe aren't so much pop stars as they are social commentators who set their words of wisdom to disco beats.  A case in point is the duo's 1993 album, \\"Very,\\" which is not only their most engaging album to date, but it's one of the best records of the 1990s.  As good dance records should, the melodies are catchy and the beats pulsate, but \\"Very\\"'s strength is in the lyrics which boil over with a dry, acid wit.  Tennant tells the story of a self-loathing closet case in \\"Can You Forgive Her,\\" offers a heartfelt tribute to those who have passed on from AIDS in \\"Dreaming of the Queen,\\" breathes new life into the love song in the soaring \\"Liberation\\" and \\"I Wouldn't Normally Do This Kind of Thing.\\"  Pet Shop Boys are a rare talent in a climate where style prevails over substance, and I still don't think they're getting the level of global recognition they deserve.  Pop music rarely gets any better than this, and \\"Very\\" provides a snapshot of the duo at their best.  A truly surreal listening experience.
B000001F9E|5.0|The cover depicts the band as some cartoon renegades escaping from some 'Orwellian' future world. Fortunately, the music goes a lot deeper! This is first rate storytelling with killer guitar harmonies. It can be bombastic and subtle (sometimes within the same song). Start with this one if you're just starting to discover Thin Lizzy.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Iron Maiden is the quintessential metal band.  They have never sold out, (although they've sold well,) and have always stayed true to themselves, their fans, and to the style of music that they choose to play.  They never went to hair metal in the late 80's, they didn't become another Pantera clone in the 90's, and they haven't turned into a nu-metal band in the 00's.<br />Now, I'd be lying if I said that this album is everything I hoped that it would be.  However, I'd also be lying if I said that I wasn't relieved that this album didn't turn out as badly as I feared it would. After all, this is Maiden's 13th studio album.  They've been around for something like 27 years now.  One has to think that the creative reserves get exhausted at some point.  However, Maiden hasn't reached that point yet, obviously, as Dance of Death is a solid album.<br />Certainly, Dance of Death kicks the vast majority of the current hard rock/heavy metal albums to the curb.  The singer actually sings, the songs have melodity, and the lyrics actually have some substance.  There's no fake testosterone here, no vocalists shouting and trying to sound angry and tough, and, THANK GOD, none of the lyrical cliches of nu-metal, the songs of which all boil down to \\"F the world\\" or the ubiquitious \\"I'm really angry and I'm about to totally lose it.\\"<br />Still, I can't give this album five stars because I'm comparing it with  past Maiden albums.  While it is a better album than, say, Somewhere in Time, No Prayer For The Dying, or Virtual XI, it doesn't quite rank up there with Seventh Son or Powerslave. While Dance of Death is good, I'm starting to hear some self-repetion from Maiden's songwriters, it has a couple of weaker tracks, (Wildest Dreams and Age of Innocence,) and some of the material fails to really come alive into the good galloping riffs and arena-moving hooks that Maiden is famous for.<br />But this album is definitely worth owning. Songs like Rainmaker, Montsegur, Paschendale, and NewFrontiers, (the first song that drummer Nicko McBrain has helped write in the twenty years that he's been with the band,) are instant Maiden classics.  Maiden is the greatest metal band of all time, bar none, and, what's greatest, is that they are still an active band.  They aren't a bunch of old guys desperately trying to hold on.  They're still here and they are still making great music.  This isn't a comeback album.  This is just the latest in an excellent and extensive library.
B00008AY3L|5.0|Master of all. As funky as Prince and George Clinton and as folky as Dylan and Cat Stevens. This guy does it all and better than most. It would be very risky for most artists to cover so many genres on one album and remain credible. Ben Harper manages to put his mark on each tune so that they flow seamlessly into one another. I am sorry that it took me so long to give this guy a chance. I will be picking up his back catalog, no doubt.
B000002LFL|3.0|I am on of the biggest Smiths fans there is. And yes, you must get this if you are a fan. But, you can't help but wonder why (especially on cd) why Morrissey (apparently, he decided what songs were to go on this album) skipped out on many great tracks that the Smiths played on this night.<br /><br />  Songs like: &quot;Frankly, Mr. Shankly&quot; , &quot;There is a light that never goes out&quot;, &quot;I want the one I can't have&quot;, &quot;How soon is now?&quot; and others were sadly omitted. The overall sound is very good but you can't help but feel like your being swindled here. I hope &quot;they&quot; decide to release another live album to make up for &quot;Rank&quot;.

B0000AI44Q|3.0|I love Neil with Crazy Horse. This album features Crazy Horse. So those of you that love Neil in all his manic ragged Guitar glory he delivers the goods. On the other hand part of me wonders if this whole project wasn'nt just Neil's version of Lolita. He comes up with a simplistic tale as a vehicle to entertain or maybe just to provide an excuse to go on tour with his daughter's hottie school mate in the role of Britney(maybe I am just cynical and he is merely trying to gain a younger audience) In any event the horse and Neil's guitarplaying are  great, the story kind a dumb, and the girl is hot in the role of a dancing hiphugger wearing treehugger.
B000069AT7|5.0|Before Steven Spielberg tackled racial issues in films like THE COLOR PURPLE and AMISTAD, he had made a film that extols the beauty of understanding and friendship between different races and cultures. It was a seemingly innocuous fantasy called E.T. THE EXTRA TERRESTRIAL, about a little boy who braves language and other barriers to develop a spiritual kinship with an outer space alien stranded on Earth. The success of this film is in no small part due to the well-developed and convincing portrayal of E.T., a grotesque-looking figure who becomes an understanding companion, a wise older friend, a mischievous creature at times, and yet ultimately a saintly, noble being. This is a rare film that offers a poignant celebration of our good natures. <br />Just as he made an \\"enhanced version\\" of CLOSE ENCOUNTER OF THE 3RD KIND in 1980, Spielberg re-released E.T. in 2002 with what I would consider pretty extensive modifications to the 1982 version. Many of the changes are harmless, such as the various re-touchings of backdrops for greater realism, refinements of some special effects shots, the addition of a scene of E.T. taking a bath (to show more of its playfulness), and the significantly re-shot flying sequences that quite seamlessly match the originals. The removal of the shot that suggests a shotgun is to be used against E.T. and the boy doesn't bother me, as it does others. I remember in my first viewing back in '82, I thought the idea of any physical menace to E.T. was needlessly threatening, since the possibility of E.T's capture by scientists was already terrible enough. <br />Some of the changes in the '02 version, while harmless, are unnecessary. In the first shot of the spaceship, it emits blue lights, whereas in the '82 version, they are red (the film's emblematic color). The word \\"terrorist\\" has been eliminated from an off-screen dialog, and replaced with the rather odd \\"hippie.\\" Just before the first flying sequence, the boy plunges down the cliff several feet further than he does in the '82 version, making his movement look a little less fluid. <br />Some of the changes, however, are ill-advised. The opening sequence has been revised to show more of E.T., including an added medium shot that shows its entire body. In the '82 version, we never get a good look at the alien during this sequence, so that in a close-up view a few scenes later, we are genuinely startled by its appearance. The least desirable changes are the ones that enhance E.T.'s facial expressions and body movements. The close-up view of a frightened E.T. in the boy's backyard early in the film has been re-created entirely with computer-generated images (CGI). The overzealous CGI artists have given E.T. a lot of exaggerated body movements, and the result not only doesn't nearly have as much impact as the spooky and haggard mechanical E.T. in the '82 version, but it looks rather comical and cartoon-like. In fact, throughout the '02 version, whenever E.T. has any strong emotion, the CGI enhancements fail considerably in capturing the precise tone of E.T.'s disposition. They either make it look a little too agile, a little too cartoonish, too silly, and a little too physically demonstrative that is unfit for the gentle nature of the film. <br />Fortunately, the 3-disc \\"Ultimate Gift Set\\" DVD (which is actually a 4-disc set, with 3 DVDs and 1 music CD of the film's soundtrack) and the cheaper 2-disc DVD set have both the '82 and '02 versions. Both versions have restored video transfers that look identical in quality. (The folks at the DVDFile site did notice minor differences in the two transfers, however.) The Dolby Digital and DTS audio tracks sound terrific, with the DTS track offering a little more \\"oomph.\\" Mysteriously, the Ultimate Gift Set has no DTS track for the '82 version. This is not a error, for the specifications on the box clearly state that only the '02 version has a DTS track. The cheaper 2-disc set does have DTS tracks for both '82 and '02 versions. Both the Ultimate Gift Set and the 2-disc set have a separate audio track of a live recording of the '02 theatrical premiere, complete with cheers and applauses from the audience and a score conducted live by John Williams. Note that this is not an isolated music track. You still hear the film's dialogs and sound effects (which sound a little reverberated in the recording environment). <br />Other DVD extras of note include a 37-minute \\"Look back\\" featurette (which is not on the 2-disc set) and a 50-minute featurette \\"Evolution and Creation of E.T\\" (2-disc set has a 24-minute version of it) which offer fascinating footage of Spielberg giving direction on the set and present-day reminiscences from the cast and crew. There is a 10-minute featurette (not on 2-disc set) that shows footage of John Williams composing and conducting the E.T. score. There is also a 17-minute footage from '02 theatrical premiere event. <br />The Ultimate Gift Set also includes a 192-page hard-cover book called \\"From Concepts to Classic\\" that is well worth the price. It is replete with photos and drawings, many of which are rarely seen (there is a still from a deleted scene of E.T. entering Mom's bedroom that suggests that E.T. has a crush on her!). There is a section on the many modifications for the '02 version of the film, including many technical details. Also, the complete screenplay of the film ('02 version only) is included. (I also posted a slightly longer version of this review at epinions.com, under the id kevyip.)
B0000BYM3K|4.0|The best maiden album since Pice Of Mind great guitar and bruce as hes best the singel wildest dreams is not the best song on the album
B00004TDTO|5.0|In 1975 \\"Jaws\\" was a phenomenon.  The one theater in Colorado Springs that was playing \\"Jaws\\" had lines for every showing for weeks, and the movie was in the theater for months.<br />The opening moments of this movie became the standard for hosts of low-budget gore-fests to follow, completely missing the style and drama of this movie.  Our introductory characters are doing what all young adults do, partying and having fun, never imagining the menace lurking, just, below, the water.  The music begins, with the characteristic sequence used by millions to enhance completely unrelated water-cooler conversations, menacing, sending chills up your spine, it's that SHARK MUSIC!  Dozens of cheap horror movies have tried without success to copy the opening, yearning to set the stage for the supposed horror to come.<br />In its own way, this movie combines the drama of \\"The Old Man and the Sea,\\" with far more action, and the thrill of a well-done monster movie.  This movie, while involving a host of protagonists, is ultimately a battle between Police Chief Martin Brody (Roy Scheider) and a great white shark, which represents not only itself, but all Brody's personal demons.<br />It's amazing that a mechanical shark could generate such terror.  Watching how the movie was made, it's relatively easy to see that the shark was mechanical.  Stephen Spielberg used clever camera work in combination with the intensity of each shark appearance to keep your focus on the story and being held in suspense, completely ignoring whatever flaws there may have been in his excellent mechanical monster.  Furthermore, the shark inspires fear not by crude use of blood and entrails being swallowed or floating in the water, but by frothy water and its sudden, yet anticipated, appearances, with a bit of red-coloring to bring out your worst fears.<br />What enhances the terror of the shark attacks is that they occur at a public beach, where millions journey each year.  Shark experts Matt Hooper (Richard Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration).  The audience knows what's coming, and yet the innocents on the beach insist on throwing themselves into harm's way.<br />The final sequence in the movie is excellent, and provides an inexorable buildup to the climax, fast yet slow.  This sequence also provides what is probably the goriest portion of the movie.  In the end, as in many dramas, the battle is between Chief Brody and the antagonist, the shark.  Can Chief Brody conquer his fears?  How will he do it?  The suspense is just killing me!  Here comes the SHARK!!!  LOOK OUT!!!<br />This movie is still suspenseful and well worth watching more than 25 years after its release.  One of the best monster movies ever, and just enough basis in reality to be considered a drama as well.  Five stars for a movie you can watch over and over again.Dreyfuss) and Quint (Robert Shaw) provide all sorts of true information regarding sharks to give you the picture that they are mindless killing machines (though that is an extreme exaggeration).

B00005JLSE|3.0|Why this movie got such great reviews is a mystery to me. it was okay, but not half as good as all the hype suggested -- and not nearly as creative as &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; was a year or so earlier. And yet that wonderfully imaginitive movie has the bad reputation, while this middle of the road movie had people falling over themselves in search of ever higher praise. <br />Bland movies are popular in &quot;exciting&quot; times, I guess...
B000002P6R|3.0|The Who is one of, if not, the greatest band of all time.  I think, however, that Pete Townshend's perpetual identity crises finally got the best of him here.  The Who By Numbers was a beautifully done self-analysis, but by Face Dances, it seems that Pete was just trying to keep from becoming antequated, and in doing so, abandoned much of the style that made the Who truly great. Let's face it: the early 1980s was not a good time to adapt to the popular style.  I would recommend this album to any Who fan, but can only say that it is certainly a far cry from the golden age of Sell Out through By Numbers.

I loved this book especially when they all found out that his dad was a Animagus along with everyone else..  I was so upset when I found out that it was ***** who dies in the next book! I haven't even read it yet and I'm sad anyway!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|At first listen, I didn't quite understand what Iron Maiden was trying to do with this album. But then I realized it... they managed to take everything that was great about classic Iron Maiden and evolve it into a fresh, finely polished sound. Each track is refreshing, technically blinding and full of musical talent. Start listening with an open mind and you will be very satisfied!<br />A definite step up from Brave New World (2000), the members of IM are playing/writing better than ever... together! I'm thoroughly convinced that this lineup is Maiden's best ever. Everything is dead on. There is not one bad track on this CD.
0375707972|3.0|This book was ok, but left me thinking it was kind of gross and weird.  The ending was a nice little twist, and it was a quick easy read, but not the greatest thing I've picked up.  I didn't really like or connect with the main characters and couldn't understand the appeal of the relationship between the two.  If you have nothing better read, go for it, otherwise pass on it.
B00005JLWN|3.0|Take equal helpings of Fahrenheit 451 and 1984.  Throw in a cute babe.  Make sure you have great looking costumes and production/set design.  Add heavy-handed dialogue.  Have the main character do a non-credible about face from emotionless slaughterer of dozens of human beings to being moved by a single puppy.  (Gee, how in the heck did THAT happen?)<br />It just doesn't work, folks.  Why three stars?  Cause the production/set design IS really good.  Cause most of the actors ARE very good.  The cute babe, for example, is Emily Watson and she IS an excellent actress.  Sean Bean, though here only briefly, IS a good actor.  In the lead role, Christian Bale DOES do a good job.  The look of the film is top notch.<br />The gun battles are not ultra-cool but just kind of...there.  It's just a whole lotta guys shooting a whole lotta bullets out of a whole lotta guns with a whole lotta people dying as a result. Yeah, so?<br />The original Matrix rocked because the concept was so breathtaking--ESPECIALLY the way it was developed.  The concept here is NOTHING like the Matrix at all.  It is a straightforward tried and true 1950s (even 1940s)-style science fiction idea: emotion will harm you so let's get rid of it and have unfeeling robotoids populate the world, numbed by the injection of a government-dispensed drug.<br />This is mildly entertaining (the real reason for the three stars) but is not a great contemporary science fiction film.  The Matrix (the original) is far superior.  So is Dark City.  This one is...just OK.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Well once again Iron Maiden have come up with a stellar cd. It is classic Maiden in many ways and once again tells us that Iron Maiden is one of the worlds premier rock/metal bands. The cd gets rolling right away with the quick paced Wildest Dreams. A pretty much straight ahead rock tune and a good one at that. The others Rainmaker, No More Lies, Montsegur, Dance Of Death, Gates Of Tomorrow, New Frontier, Paschendale (Maiden's best tune ever!), Face In The Sand, Age Of Innocence and Journeyman are all classic sounding Maiden tunes. Nothing new, but all very fresh and wonderfully familiar. Some may criticize Maiden for not stepping out and trying something different, but why fix what's not broke. These guys always give us what we want and never stray to far away from their roots. Metallica is a band that has totally lost touch with it's fans, while Maiden's legend continues to grow. Overall this cd is what ones everyone expects a Maiden cd to be, classic in every way with no BS or filler.<br /><br />The production is also about a 7.5 out of 10. It's very good, but not perfect as it seems stale in spots and doesn't ring out or have an airy quality about it.<br /><br />Once again this is Maiden and not some other band. They are back!!, they are great!! and they rule the rock world.
0156027321|5.0|Young Pi Patel, obedient son of a zookeeper in India, has embraced Christianity, Indouism and Islam, not to make an adolescent rebellion, but simply because he has found in all three religions one single faith and global understanding of the need to believe in a higher power. The ship which carries him, his family and some of the zoo's wild animals to Canada becomes a wreck and Pi is found adrift in the Pacific Ocean with a zebra, a hyena, an orangutan and Richard Parker, an immense Bengal tiger. After a vicious sorting out of animal supremacy, Pi is left with Richard Parker, wondering whether he will be the next victim of his co-survivor's fury and most of all hunger.<BR> <BR>Yann Martel is playing with the reader, shows Pi's endless quest for the one and only truth, grants him with insurmountable patience and courage and gives us one of the best buddy relationships ever to appear in literature. Pi struggles, endures famine, manages to find a modus vivendi with Richard Parker and most of all keeps his faith to ...what? Survival, life, inner power. It will be trite to call Life of Pi a great book and Martel a great and promising writer. If you have wondered how you would react under conditions of real dispair, if your fears tend to overcome your will, if the path you have chosen to lead your life makes you stop once in a while and ponder whether you are going to get lost or have already missed the true meaning of your quest (whatever that may be), then reading this book will show you not which road to take or amendments to make, but that the only thing you need to keep, precious as your life itself and maybe even more so, is faith. <br />The true meaning of the scenery that Martel's depicts is that irrespective of the true realms of reality, we alone carry our fears and dress them up in different shapes and forms. But we should also do the same as concerns the true essence of the power we need to overcome anything and everything that casts a shadow in our own existence. Pi fought for his life, period. Pi won. The \\"how\\" and \\"how could that be\\" is something else. You need to read it, feel it, see it for yourselves.<br />There are people who have loved this book and a few others who have condemned it for mediocrity. I suggest noone should fall into the trap of categorising this excellent work. It is a view of life we encounter only rarely in our literary adventures. Just embark on it and enjoy what it offers and there is plenty there.<br />Not only do I recommend this book, but most importantly I humbly bow to Martel's genius and imagination.
B000003RCY|5.0|Herzeleid is, in my opinion, one of the best cd's i've ever heard.   I bought it along with Sehnsucht 2 years ago and I must say, GODDAMN!.  There isn't a single song on this cd I wouldn't recommend someone.  Sure the lyrics are in german and that may be a throw-off, but if you know any german at all, or if you don't, this is still one hard hitting piece of artistry.  Get it now, seriously, and if you don't like it, then you can kick me in the nuts.  (also check out megaherz kopfschuss, wer bist du, and herzwerk 1 and 2)
0385504209|3.0|I very much enjoyed the premise of the book and loved the thought-provoking issues it touched on, but was somewhat disheartened by the claim that the book was one of the best mystery reads of the year. Brown sets up his two characters as figures of great intellectual authority (Sophie, cryptologist; Langdon, Harvard professor specializing in religious symbolism), but I found myself solving the novel's \\"puzzles\\" two or three pages ahead of the characters. I don't claim to know much about art history, grail legend, or goddess worship, but having rudimentary knowledge of Da Vinci's work, romance language, and  church history should NOT allow a reader to out-reason characters set up to be experts. Nevertheless, I appreciate any author that attempts to disspell many of the conventions about religion, history, and humanity to which so many people so desparately cling.

B0000B1OE7|5.0|...<br />There really is nothing new that this movie brings to the table in terms of story.  But that's not what makes it special.  Yoshiaki-san has found a way to blend two popular genres, action and feudal japan, in the realm of anime.  Let's face it, a movie of this graphic a magnitude just wouldn't cut it in live action.  Plus, sometimes it's just more fun to watch it animated.<br />One warning, though.  If you are faint of heart of stomach, or have a weak constitution all around, and haven't seen this movie, it is best that you keep it that way. ... this movie still stands as one of the most violent OAV to ever come out of Japan.  Still, if you're feeling up to a little animated mayhem, I definitely suggest giving Ninja Scroll ninety minutes of your life.  You shouldn't regret it.

0783225547|4.0|Sure, the first half starts out slow, but unlike most disaster movies that take that time to develop cardboard characters that aren't half as important as the CGI mayhem that befalls them, DANTE'S PEAK does it just right.  By the time the volcano does its thing (done well acctually, the second half of the film is relentlessly paced) we care about the people this disaster has engulfed.  This is a great movie with solid performances and some tensely exciting action not to mention solid fx.  DVD is chocked full of extras and looks and sounds great.  A superb addition to any collection.
B0000BYM3K|3.0|THe first two songs are useless,(&quot;Wildest Dreams&quot; and &quot;Rainmaker&quot;) its rock and roll, not Iron Maiden, it will add nothing to their catalog.

A little problem is that Dickinson is screaming a lot instead of singing, singing whole songs at a high range.
B000006IUQ|5.0|A juggernaught of a film, THE EDGE delivers and then some.  Extreemly well written, expertly lensed, wonderfully acted, mature, exciting, edge of your seat entertainment that moves like a hungry mankilling bear after a portly english thesbian.  Fast.  A great adventure tale that's grounded in reality, making it THE ultimate survival flick.  THE EDGE also bennefits from a strong plot as well, a story thick with character development (another in the long string of superb HOPKINS performances) and edge of your seat cliffhangers.  Oh, and a giant bear whose desire for dining on human flesh is insatiable.  Great DVD viewing, there is a lack of extras on the disc but with a film this good all you need is the feature.
0385504209|5.0|A fast moving book and perhaps the most amazing thing is that the main characters stay wide awake for nearly 48 hours after being woken up in the middle of the night and zipping all over Paris and London. If you are not familiar with the history of the Grail Legend, (which I wasn't) I think you will find this one of the most fascinating parts of the story. The amount of research required to write this must have been considerable.<br />A previous and certainly perceptive reviewer could see the plot twists a few pages in advance, and I too sensed something was coming in a couple places, but most twists and turns were genuine surprises. Fans of this prose who like more human insight will feel a little let down, as the characters have some depth, but are more there to advance the plot than anything else.<br />I've read better popular non-fiction, but only rarely.
B0000BYM3K|2.0|I don't even see the point in Bruce getting back with iron maiden since he doesnt even get to write his own lyrics...or use the musical ideas that he use to back in the Seventh Son and Poweslave days.Sorry but Steve Harris needs to let some of the other guys come up with there own ideas...and quit leading the band in the boring lyrical and musical direction that they are heading(or have been heading since after no prayer).These songs just lack any sort of old maiden energy and luster they had in the early days.Boring mid-tempo songs drag the album down after just a few if you can call them more (upbeat) type songs...then the songs seem to wanna take off in a more up-tempo direction but just seem to keep the same old slow pace.So obviously Bruce needs to get back to his solo stuff..which in my opinion sounds more like OLD maiden than the real maiden ever will again.Just listen to his solo songs like,The Tower,Silver Wings(classic),Book of thel,Dark side of Aqairius,(great lyrics)among many others.Sorry but i think maiden has finally fell into the commercial realm of TO mature,mediocre rock..and forgotten they're roots.Hats off to the decent songs on the album,which isnt saying much,Wildest Dreams,and Montsegur.But more or less,,,YAWN.
B00005RHGK|1.0|This movie, apart from the brief opening sequence, is lame. Do yourself a favor and stay far away from this stinker.
B00008EY9G|4.0|Identity is very interesting from the beginning - it's the type of movie that takes hold and keeps your attention 'till the end. The opening sequence - the one that lands the characters in the same motel - is incredible. As the movie progresses,  you know there's a catch of some sort - something going on that you can't put your finger on, but if you're like me then it doesn't hit you until the very end when it's all revealed. I had a hunch as to \\"who dun it\\" - but I was badly mistaken. Unless someone gives away the ending before you watch this - you'll probably find yourself guessing until the end. John Cusack is simply awesome in this movie - just fun to watch. Ray Liotta's character is somewhat dark and oddly captivating. You'll think \\"There's just something about him. . .\\" Clea DuVall is interesting as always, and Amanda Peet seems to add something organic to the film. The cast is well assembled to say the least - an interesting mix of faces. This is a fun and original thrill ride with a wicked surprise ending. If you're looking for something fresh, you won't be disappointed. There are a couple of shocks during the movie - but the one at the end will floor you.
B0000A02TZ|5.0|I contacted Universal Studios via email telling them what I thought of them forcing purchasers of their DVD to endure over 5 minutes of previews and commercials before being able to watch the movie that they paid for, and this is the response that I received:<br />Here is how you bypass them.<br />Thank you for contacting us.

B00006RU5B|4.0|When I first heard that Chris Cornell was starting a new band with the erstwhile musicians of Rage Against The Machine, my reaction could best be described as ecstatic.  Cornell is easily one of my favorite vocalists (perhaps eclipsed only by Jens Kidman of the almighty Meshuggah), and I've never considered Rage to be anything to sneeze at either.  I thought Ragegarden (as my college roommate and I still refer to the band to this day), would be nothing short of revolutionary, rendering all preceding music virtually obsolete.  Needless to say, I was rigid in joyful anticipation in the weeks leading up to their debut album's release.<br />When I finally got and heard the album, my reaction was one of extreme disappointment.  I just couldn't hear anything special about Audioslave.  Rather than sounding revolutionary, their album sounded to me like yet another grunge retread.  At times, it even made me think of Nickelback (Aaaaaiiiiiiiiyyyyeeeeeeee!).<br />However, after putting the CD away for about six months and then breaking it out again for a few more listens, I can see it's much better than I initially believed.  As is to be expected from a band consisting of Cornell and the ex-Ragers, the songwriting is tight, the vocals powerful, and the musicianship solid (and often spectacular).  But coming from such a stellar cast, I think I have the right to expect more.  Can anyone take this album, put it up against \\"Superunknown\\" song for song and say it even comes close?  I think not.<br />This isn't a knock against the singles.  \\"Audioslave\\" (couldn't they have come up with a better album title?) may be one of the few albums whose best songs made it to the radio.  The powerhouse opener \\"Cochise\\" proves conclusively that Cornell's voice has lost none of its ferocity, the mournful ballad \\"Like A Stone\\" is millions of times more eloquent than anything the likes of Puddle Of Mudd or John Mayer will ever do, and \\"Show Me How To Live\\" features one of the catchiest, most explosive choruses in history.<br />The rest of the album, while far from bad, doesn't fare quite as well.  There's certainly nothing wrong with it, but I just can't listen to this album without comparing what I hear with the brilliance that was Soundgarden's best work (to a lesser extent, the same can be said of Rage).  After \\"Like A Stone,\\" the band mixes hard-charging rock with more midtempo stuff, with results ranging from passable to excellent.<br />Unfortunately, the songs here too often seem stuck in the whole Seattle aesthetic that Soundgarden helped to create.  There's nothing wrong with sticking to your roots, but Audioslave is a new band, and as such I think they should have devoted more of their album to exploring new directions that their undeniably prodigious levels of talent and creativity would have allowed them.  When I heard that Cornell was getting together with the members of Rage Against The Machine, I expected something tantamount to genetically engineered super music, not a highly competent take on what's already been done by members of the \\"Seattle scene.\\"<br />The main problem here, in my opinion, is this album's length.  At fourteen songs clocking in at around sixty-five minutes, the it's simply not varied enough.  They should have either devoted a few songs to branching out from the alternative/hard rock template that characterizes the album, or cut out a few songs.  As it is, this album qualifies as a bit too much of a good thing.<br />Look, I really don't want to sound as if I'm bashing this album, because that's not my intention.  But I had *enormous* expectations for it prior to its release, and they just weren't met.  I think Audioslave could turn out to be a band worthy of its personnel, but I also think I'd be remiss if I didn't point out that there's some room for improvement.ive choruses in history.  <br />The rest of the album, while far from bad, doesn't fare quite as well.

B0000BYM3K|5.0|I like this CD a little better than &quot;Brave New World&quot; -- it sounds a lot like mid-80's Maiden circa &quot;Powerslave&quot; and &quot;Somewhere in Time&quot;.  There are a few short and fast songs along with a few longer epics. &quot;New Frontier&quot;, &quot;Gates of Tomorrow&quot; and &quot;Dance of Death&quot; are my favorites, but overall every song is pretty good except for the last track which is just too ballad-like for my taste.
0451207521|4.0|If I was a gambling man, I'd bet some serious money that Ken Follett had a woman write part of this book. Whenever there's extra prose about women's clothing, it is almost always a tipoff that it's a woman doing the writing. In any event, it works in this book. Also, there seems to be almost a focus on homosexual women throughout the story. Easy to scan past. On a high note, I was especially impressed with some of the research into proper radio procedures, telephone systems and equipment of that era, and proper terminology. (yes, the squarish metal thing with all of the rounds inside  and that is inserted into a rifle or pistol is called a magazine, not a clip)  A bit of a nit pick is the use of PC language sprinkled here and there. What the heck, that's why it's called fiction. Enjoy the book, it will give you a good ride.
B000002JKA|5.0|This could perhaps be the best metal CD ever produced, made and released. Coming after the incredible Images &amp; Words, Awake not only surpasses its predessor in musicianship of metal but sets new standards that will haunt the band in the future. This was evident when all of us fans compalined about the commericial route take by Dream Theater (DT) for the next full lenght album, Falling into Infinity. Anyway, Awake begings with the rocking 6.00 which is written by the talented and enigmatic Kevin Moore who left the band after this album. Its about the mechanic city life of getting up, going to work, coming back and eating microwave heated food and stuff like that. In a way its like describing the life of Ed Norton (Jack) in FightClub before he becomes Tyler Durded. Its a classic!  But there its just a warmup classic as there are more incredible tunes to follow. Caught in a web follows and it is perhaps the only radio-friendly song of the album, I mean it in a nice way. Its a good song and keeps the momemtum going and so does Innocence Faded, which has a excellent intro and features superb drumming for Portnoy, no wonder he is maybe the most talented drummer around. Then comes the instrumental masterpeice Erotomania (the word coined by DT), its awesome. Its like a microcosm of all the songs featured in this CD. an exceptional guitar outro shows you why Petruchhi is often called Guitar God!. <br />FRom here begins the actual magnum opus of the album, Voices could be the finest song Petruchi ever wrote and its disturbingly beautiful. This song is going to haunt to for a long time as the soothing yet angry voice of LaBrie time and again kills you. The Silent man is an accoustic song (tho DT does perform this song in electric at times) and its good. but perhaps it should have been kept in the last or something as Voices, Mirror, Lie and Scarred are the metal monsters best played in full volume. DT hit full throtle here and we need to keep with that head banging going,and its tough. Words really cannot describe these 4 classic songs and they are perhaps the best metal tracks DT ever composed. This is what metal is!<br />LIfitng Shadows written by very talented and very overlooked bassi, John Myung is meloncholic with a great guitar lead coming in between. Its a great sad song but is followed by an even greater sad song written by a morose Kevin Moore, he is just incredible in this song and will be ever missed from the band. Actually he left a void in DT that was hard to fill, even till today. Derek Sherinian could not do that but Jordon Rudess comes close. But no one can fill those boots of Kevin Moore. Space-Dye Vest is a incredibly sad song and you want to hear again and again. Great lyrics, exceptional music and probably a great way to end this seminal classic. No other Cd of DT has such a great ending. This is so much like Queensryche who have made it a tradition to end thier albums with great songs of epic meloncholy. If you like metal, buy this CD, if you like DT, buy this CD, if you like guitars, buy this CD, if you like drums, buy this CD and if you like rock music or wanna hear something like Deep Purple play Pantera buy this CD. AWESOME.. Thank you DT...
B000002NBY|5.0|this album is utterly incredible.  i have been known to get emotional upon the excitment of hearing it.  its a 100% classic that everyone must own and no matter how many times you hear it, it never gets old.  its a must-have for everyone, all ages, shapes and sizes!
B00005JKC3|2.0|This movie was a bit dull for a comic book adaption...the 1st 40 minutes was about the origin..an extended origin unlike the comic and could have been alot less dealt with..Finally, the Hulk shows up and most of the fight scenes--ARE IN THE DARK??? you couldn't make things out...Since the storyline was so dragged out you would have thought the technical effects would have balanced the movie out, but i was a disappointment...hopefully a sequal will be made with a different writer and a btter HULKmovie will be brought more to the comic fan...
B000002UAX|2.0|I guess I don't really need another reviewer to interpret what the Beatles intended, or how songs were supposed to sound relative to one another. I really don't like songs like Wild Honey Pie, Revolution #9 or Rocky Raccoon.  I think this album is a bit of a clean out of the closet.  It's too bad, because while there was an abundance of songs on this album, there is a shortage of completed work on Abbey Road.<br />Unless someone was in the studio with the band, it's pretty arrogant to claim to know what was intended - I can ASSURE you.<br />2 stars, and I'm being generous.
B000059HB7|4.0|This is one of my favorite Saturday afternoon movies.  You know, when you're flipping the channels looking for something good to watch.  It's a great Western with plenty of action and very good acting.  It starts out with a bang and ends with an even bigger bang and there isn't much time wasted in between.  There's a very romantic relationship that develops between John Wayne and Angie Dickinson that I found quite suggestive for its' time.  There's even some occassional comic relief.  However, the tension of the conflict is present throughout the movie.  The basic story line is wealthy rancher's obnoxious brother is tossed in jail.  The sheriff faces quite a challenge with little help from anyone else.  The wealthy rancher can buy all the gunslingers he wants in order to &quot;free&quot; his brother.  Wayne is left with an old man (Walter Brennan) and a washed up drunk (Dean Martin).  John Waynes is terrific as the no-nonse, &quot;I'm in Charge&quot; tough lawman.  Dean Martin is very good as the drunk who pulls himself together to finally face up to himself.  Walter Brennan is Walter Brennan which is meant as a compliment.  John Wayne and John Ford is a terrific combination.  This movie adds to the thought that John Wayne and Howard Hawks isn't too bad of a match either.
0767903862|2.0|Since I was planning to backpack around Australia I thought I'd read this book to discover some interesting spots that weren't in the guidebooks. Unfortunately this book did not fill those needs. <br />Mr Bryson appears to enjoy reading about countries more than actually travelling around them. There are many wonderful anecdotes from various literary sources (although some are far from original, despite claims to the contrary) but very little in the way of interesting experiences. For example, he spends six months in Australia and then whoops with joy upon encountering his first bit of wild life in Perth; sorry but you can't miss the kangaroos, dingos and wallabies here - he must have had his eyes shut.<br />Much of the book is dedicated to the country's cities (which aren't particularly unique) with only the final third actually about the more interesting countryside and outback. <br />This book is well written and entertaining (apart from endless comments about how people 50 years ago were so happy compared to now, and frankly stupid statements such as &quot;It's delightful to find a city [Perth] here in the first place&quot;) and if you're interested in the history of Australia then it has some great tales that you're unlikely to have heard of before. If though, like me, you'd hoped to hear about some of the more outlandish places and characters from Down Under then you'll be sorely disappointed.
B000002VMD|5.0|&quot;The bodyguard&quot; probably shows Ms Houston in the pinnacle of her career.  Her vocals have finally matured and sound better then ever.  The powerhouse megahit &quot;I Will Always Love You&quot; originally written/sung by Dolly Parton spent over 14 weeks at the number one chart, making it one of the longest number one hits on the charts.  David Foster is the primary producer of her radio hits, doing his best and succeeds at imitating &quot;Babyface&quot;'s work. The highlights are obviously Whitney's hits, such as the soulful &quot;Run To You&quot; and &quot;I Have Nothing.&quot;  I also enjoy the down-right FUNKY remake of Chaka Kahn's &quot;I'm Every Woman&quot; as well as the sassy powerhouse hit &quot;Queen of the Night.&quot; The second half of the album features such artists as famed Saxophonist Kenny G, soul legend Aaron Neville and her mother Cissy Houston. &quot;The Bodyguard&quot; shows Whitney's voice at her best, and the Gospel track &quot;Jesus Loves Me&quot; prooves that as well. I really reccomend this soundtrack to anyone who enjoyed the radio hits and is clammoring for more Whitney!
1556154844|5.0|There is no other work to compete with McConnell's Code Complete.  Nearly unreadable end to end, it is an excellent reference for jr and mid level developers and managers to help understand the nuace of what programming really is.
B0000028VT|5.0|\\"Music Box\\" is one of her best and most succesful albums. I think my version has some more tracks then the listing on amazon.com but then again I got it as a cassette in 3rd grade. Mine has some uptempo dance tracks as well as the beautiful ballads and utptempo numbers.  \\"Dreamlover\\" marks her longest running number one hit spending at leased 12 weeks at the top of the charts.  Another number one hit is \\"Hero' which is definately one of her best songs and is a signature song from her.  My favorite song is the overlooked Top 10 hit \\"Anytime You Need A Friend\\" where she sounds amazing!  If you liked \\"My All\\" then you'll like the beautiful \\"Just To Hold You Once Again\\" which is similar. Another highlight is the hit remake \\"Without You\\" which is just beautiful. I Really reccomend \\"Music Box\\" to Mariah Carey fans as well as casual fans who liked her radio hits. This is great driving music cause it has a mix of slow and uptempo songs, but some of them sound kind of dated, but still a great CD! I also reccomend \\"Butterfly\\"!
1586210661|5.0|I have recently discovered David Sedaris and I am all ready a huge fan.  However, he is even funnier when you LISTEN to him read.  I strongly recommend that you buy the Audio CD of his work if you can.  The version I have of Me Talk Pretty One Day is ABRIDGED.  I do not know if they make an unabridged version.  It is missing the story Big Boy, which is many people's favorite.  On the other hand, there are bonus tracks from Sedaris live that are VERY funny and not available anywhere else.
B000002UAU|5.0|This is the most well known album of all time. This  is the one that was no 1 in America for 15 weeks and no 1 in England for 22 weeks straight. This is the one that won a grammy for album of the year. This is the one that has sold 36 million copies worldwide to date,and is still the all time best selling album in England,and went to number 1 all over the world.
B00005JMNY|3.0|I imagine most of America will be interested in Party Monster to see little Macaulay Culkin all grown up.  Well, he is, and he turns in a very disturbing performance.  After about five minutes of watching him act, you forget Home Alone and buy him as Michael Alig - the ambisexual party king of New York.  <br />The movie itself is very enjoyable.  I learned a lot about Eighties culture that I'd never known before.  Seth Green keeps impressing me with his acting/comic abilities.  The film is about grim subject matter but manages to be fun and funny until its sad, grisly conclusion.
B000000HTM|5.0|Although there are songs on other albums which are better than these, this album is the most consistantly good of the Van Der Graaf Genrator albums I've heard (which is almost all of them). Three long tunes, articulate, slightly threataning lyrics, sometimes fast, sometimes slow, this album is just about as good as it gets. I love wierd lyrics and there's plenty of it to be had here. The first song is the weakest but the whole album is great!o
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park is just pure talent.  Their songs stay with you for a long while too and they write just plain good lyrics.  This cd is totally awsome.  These guys dont just put out a new cd with songs that are just okay, they take the time to make sure that they are perfect and that is what makes them so great.  I mean, I couldnt even pick a favorite song...they all are fabulose.  Linkin Park is the best band ever!!!  BUY THIS CD OR I WILL CRUSH YOU!!!
B00008G9JO|4.0|I think that the reason that this album doesn't get as good reviews from many Amazon.com customers is because it is very close thematically and musically to its superior predecessor Songs from the Wood. Its very unusual for Tull to release two albums in a row that sound similar but that shouldn't take away fromt he fact that this is still great music. And the subject matter isn't as simple as some make it out to be. Old Brown Mouse to my mind is about being trapped, the title track is obviously about \\"progress\\" and the effect of new technologies on agriculture. Yes, OK, Weathercock is about a weathercock but songs have been written about much more mundane subject matters. And its a tribute to Anderson's songwriting that he can write such great lyrics about something so simple.
B000000993|5.0|Here's the ratings for all tracks on cd.<br />Intolerance (4 1/2) - The idea for the chorus comes from when Maynard was in the Army. His general had a motto, \\"I will never lie, cheat, steal or tolerate others who do.\\" Really good song.<br />Prison Sex (5) - One reason I bought the CD. One of my favorites.<br />Sober (1,000,000) - All my odes go to this song. The #1 reason I bought the CD. <br />Bottom w/ Henry Rollins (4) - Pretty good song.<br />Crawl Away (3 1/2) - Not the best song, but OK.<br />Swamp Song (5) - Great song, but the strongest song.<br />Undertow (4) - Pretty good song. Reminds me of a really bad day at the beach. :)<br />4 Degrees (5) - The acoustic beginning is really cool. Overall, the song is awesome.<br />Flood (4) - About a 5 minute session in the beginning. This, again, reminds of a bad day at the beach. :) Pretty good song.<br />Disgustipated (1) 15:47 of boring music! This is one of Tool's worst songs.<br />Overall average score: 5. If your a metal fan, buy this CD!
B000002U8G|5.0|Pink Floyd's 1971 album &quot;Meddle&quot; is one of those records that's better known for some of its song titles that its actual album title. As soon as someone says &quot;One Of These Days&quot; or &quot;Echoes&quot;, the likely response would be &quot;Oh yeah, THAT album.&quot;<br />&quot;Meddle&quot; shows Pink Floyd coming of age preparing the way for what was to come just two years later, the mighty &quot;Dark Side Of The Moon&quot;. Here, the band takes the experiments from earlier albums and perfects them to a tee.<br />The opening track is high-octane &quot;One Of These Days&quot; which is still one of the Floyd's most popular pre-Dark Side pieces. David Gilmour and Roger Waters both play the throbbing bass line on this track (Roger is on the left, David is on the right). Also, Gilmour plays some rollicking pedal steel guitar here. After drummer Nick Mason rants his vocal line &quot;One Of These Days I'm Going To Cut You Into Little Pieces&quot;, the band takes off on all four-cylinders rocking out like there's no tomorrow.<br />The next three tracks show off a quieter and gentler side to Pink Floyd. &quot;A Pillow Of Winds&quot; is a soothing acoustic ballad with some tender vocal work from David Gilmour. &quot;Fearless&quot; is a slow folk-rock piece in the style of Neil Young. Roger Waters doubles on bass and guitar on this track playing in a unique open-string guitar tuning. The end of &quot;Fearless&quot; features a recording of an excited crowd chanting &quot;You'll Never Walk Alone&quot; at a British Soccer game. The Roger Waters-penned &quot;San Tropez&quot; is a lively swinging piece that has actually found its way into Muzak (the music service which gets played in restaurants, grocery stores, shopping malls etc.). It's also a rather humorous track which shows off a rare side of the band.<br />Humor is also evident in the short blues piece &quot;Seamus&quot;. Here, the imagery of someone sitting on their front porch with their dog while playing the blues is clearly visible if you use your imagination. &quot;Seamus&quot; also displays David Gilmour's blues roots, a factor that's not always present when he's playing with Pink Floyd.<br />The closing track &quot;Echoes&quot; is the other well-known piece on this album. Clocking in at 23 and a half minutes, it originally took up all of side two on the original LP. The piece begins with a random piano ping fed through a Hammond organ Leslie speaker. As the other instruments slowly come in, the band builds up to the first vocal section which features David Gilmour and keyboardist Richard Wright singing in close harmony. After another crescendo, the band takes off into a stellar space-rock jam. It's actually two separate jams put together. One jam is heard in the right speaker while the other is played in the left. David Gilmour lets rip with a spine-shivering guitar lead. At around the 10-minute mark, the band-jam begins to fade out as ghostly howls start to take over. The music shifts to a ghoulish sound collage full of haunting voice-like effects and seagull sounds from David Gilmour's guitar (courtesy of a steel slide played high upon the strings). Richard Wright then brings some peace to the chaos as his organ begins to fade in leading the band into a quick but solid jam in 6/8. This leads into the final vocal section in which Gilmour and Wright reprise their flawless harmonizing. As the piece draws to its close, the dark howls from the middle section begin to re-emerge which takes the whole track to its final fade out.<br />Although, Pink Floyd would release one more album before &quot;The Dark Side Of The Moon&quot; (1972's &quot;Obscured By Clouds&quot;), &quot;Meddle&quot; is considered by many to be THE pre-Dark Side album, the calm before the storm. This album definitely shows what was to come from Pink Floyd. From the opening classic &quot;One Of These Days&quot; through its short pop/folk-oriented tracks to its closing masterpiece &quot;Echoes&quot;, &quot;Meddle&quot; is a near-perfect album. From here, it only got better.e&quot; is a near-perfect album. From here, it only got better.
B000000W6F|3.0|The most profound and innovative use of a single chord progression played time and time again until the listener is fooled into believing that there are, in actual fact, different songs. Sweet soothing harmonies teamed with a band image not to be seen on the morning of a hangover. Wonderful.
B00000J2KY|4.0|What I'll never understand is why people expect to see a word for word recreation of a book whenever it is interpreted by a filmmaker.If you know Kubrick at all,you know he only tried to realize only one artistic vision-his own.<BR> The tongue-in-cheek/double-entendre sense of humor of this film is brilliant.Like when James Mason is tapping on a stuffed beaver with a tennis racquet.Or when he and Lolita discuss the words &quot;mid-section&quot; from an Edgar Allen Poe poem.It's hard to believe this film is 40 years old because it's attitude and sense of humor is so modern and hip.<BR> Sure,Kubrick's interpretation of Nabokov's masterpiece isn't a word for word recreation.But,it's like when a musician covers a famous song.Who wants to hear him or her do it note for note?
B0000BYM3K|5.0|WOW... how can I describe IM's new album- Dance Of Death . For me it's their best in more than a decade. The outstanding songs in this album are Paschendale, Montsegur,Journeyman,Dance of Death,Rainmaker  and the first single &quot;wildest Dreams&quot;<br />In all, after you hear the album for the 1st time, these are the emotions u get from the beast's songs...dark, melodic, uniqueness, strangeness etc. I didnt expect much but I got more than I deserve. <br />The 3 man army of guitar assault never fails to blow your mind away. All this maturity in their music have made thier 13th Album a REAL jaw dropper. Bruce's vocals or rather air raid warnings just takes u to another level of doom. <br />In conclusion, you MUST BUY this album to see what Heavy Metal is all about or you will die a sore loser....<br />up the irons.<BR>Cheers...
B00005JLSE|2.0|While it's great to see that -- with &quot;Moulin Rouge&quot; and now &quot;Chicago&quot; -- Hollywood is trying to bring back musicals, I wish they would include some dancing.  Fred Astaire used to insist that the camera shoot him full length. Most of the other great film dancers did, too.  But here, instead of dancing -- instead of Bob Fosse -- we get a lot of actors in various postures, and constant cutting by the director.  It's like shooting a Shakespeare soliloqy: (wide shot) &quot;To be&quot; (close-up) &quot;or&quot; (medium tilt from Hamlet's shoes) &quot;not to be...&quot; That wouldn't allow much scope for acting. And &quot;Chicago&quot; doesn't display much dancing.
006051048X|5.0|In addition to being a master storyteller, Neil has a wonderful speaking voice. It's always interesting to listen to an author read his own work, and particularly so when the author's also fun to listen to. Neil's performance on the audio CD is excellent.
B00000DOYH|5.0|It's true. You can easily tell the folks who claim to be Zep fans but only know them through the classic rock FM stations that play the standards over and over, from the true faithful.  Ask them to name 4 songs from this record.  If you're lucky they'll be able to identify one besides \\"Kashmir\\".  Most often they'll give you a blank look. <br />To me, this was Zep's high water mark.  Here you'll find the band at its absolute peak.  The final two studio records (I don't count \\"Coda\\") didn't see much of a dropoff, to be sure, but PG is the big boy.  To me, this is the sound Jimmy Page had in mind when he founded Zep in 1968.  I'd put this in the top 4 records released in the 70's, period. <br />Disc one is flawless.  \\"Custard Pie\\" is a classic romp, with a staccato riff by Jimmy and Bonzo stop-starting for all he's worth.  Jones adds some funky bass lines and Plant growls about his desire to pleasure his lady in an oral way.  \\"The Rover\\", which follows, is so good you could just listen to the guitar riffs as if it were an instrumental and never mind the vocals, which are stellar in their own right.  \\"In My Time of Dying\\" is an epic.  Bonzo does some of his best drum work, Page adds slinky, weird slide guitar riffs, and Plant narrates the experience of a man transitioning from Earth to Heaven (and seemingly a bit dubious over his qualifications for entrance to same).  \\"Houses of the Holy\\" follows with its unforgettable riff.  The band never sounded tighter than on this cut (which was originally slated to be included on the previous album of the same name).  \\"Trampled Under Foot\\" compares a woman to the parts of a classic car as well as any song that did that ever did (or something like that).  \\"Kashmir\\", everyone knows.  \\"Arabic\\" scales and spacy lyrics - what more do you need?<br />Disc 2 starts out with \\"In The Light\\", which to me sounds like Zep does Pink Floyd-doing-Zep.  Go figure.  \\"Bron-Yr-Aur\\" is a cool little oasis of Jimmy's acoustic picking that glides from major to minor chords like silken mercury.  \\"Down By the Seaside\\", I have to admit, took some getting used to.  It's a song that was originally composed several years earlier (as are many on the record, to be accurate). It grows on you nonetheless.  \\"Ten Years Gone\\" is in my top 5 Zep songs ever.  One of the best riffs in rock guitar history if you ask me.  \\"Night Flight\\" is like \\"Seaside\\" in that on first listening you might go 'huh?', but it improves much on repeated listenings. \\"The Wanton Song\\" is a cross between James Brown and heavy metal, and it rocks.  \\"Boogie with Stu\\" is the band doing acoustic boogie-blues (duh).  It's catchy as hell.  \\"Black Country Woman\\" is another acoustic track. Plant laments his lover's mistreatment of him and warns her that he knows her sister, too.  Enjoy the banter over the sound of a propeller plane passing overhead as the track is about to be begin, and then wonder how many cigarettes a day Mr. Plant smoked back then.  \\"Sick Again\\", which ends the two-disc epic, is to me one of the most underrated Zep tracks ever.  Page's guitar roars like a dinosaur caught in a tarpit as Plant screams his love/contempt for the 70's LA groupies.  <br />Practically every hard rock album in post-1976 took a huge bit of influence from this record.  It's not only a [great] 90-minute listen, it's living rock history.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|When someone asks me what my favorite Maiden CD is, I usually reply by saying &quot;The Next One.&quot;  It is no different here.  Dance of Death is fabulous marathon from start to finish.  Maiden is not really known as a band that records singles, but Wildest Dreams is the closest song to reach that status since Can I Play With Madness.  It is a classic Adrian Smith song and maybe the best one he has ever written.  It starts the CD off with a bang.  The second song, Rainmaker, should be the second single.  This is a Dave Murray effort and I also believe it is the best one he has ever written.  Although a typical Maiden headbanger, it has a great melody and has the potential of going down as a Maiden classic.  Either of these two songs could have been the first single.  They are both that good.<br />Like Brave New World, Steve Harris, who over the years has been the chief song writer, only wrote one song on his own himself called No More Lies.  It appears now that he has relegated himself to contribute to the other members songs.  I think this has helped the diversity of the songs and made Maiden a better band overall.  But make no mistake, No More Lies is a powerful effort and a typical Harris classic.  It starts off slow, but picks up quickly and has a fantastic riff that even now is going through my head.<br />I also have to mention that for the first time, we have a Nicko McBrain song on the CD called New Frontier.  It may be his first effort, but it is a great one.  He got some help from Adrian Smith and Bruce Dickinson, but I can only hope that Nicko writes more in the future.  <br />Another classic marathon on this recording is Paschendale.  I am not much of a historian, but I believe this is based upon a battle that took place in World War I.  Adrian Smith wrote this song with an assist from Harris (sounds like his kind of lyrics).  It is an eight and a half minute bruiser my favorite on the CD.  The guitar work is explosive and althought the lyrics are darkin nature, the music is not.  This one will get you bouncing off of the walls.<br />Lastly, I wanted to mention the song Journeyman.  It is the last song and kind of a departure for Maiden.  It is a 7 minute song that is very mellow, but calling it a ballad is not fair to what it is.  From a structure standpoint, it kind of reminds me of a Dickinson solo effort called Tears of the Dragon.  Again Adrian Smith is the key writer with Harris and Dickinson pitching in.  This song really emphasizes Dickinson's ability as a singer.  He sounds great over the entire CD, but especially good on this track.  I would love to see Iron Maiden play this in concert as an acoustic number.  Great song, great lyrics.  A real gem on the CD.<br />There is no bad moment on this CD.  The title track Dance of Death is a very strong song by Jannick Gers, as is Montsegur, which from a music standpoint makes you want to jump out of your seat and mosh it up.  On the whole this is a strong effort.  I think it is better than Brave New World, if that is possible.  Go out and buy this if you are a Maiden fan.  You will not be dissapointed.
0783229321|5.0|I saw it on the second night it was out when I was 16, and it's as funny now as it was then.<br />The bonus material is excellent, especially Dean Wermer hooked up to oxygen by the pool screaming, &quot;Blutarsky!!!&quot;
0449227421|1.0|What happened to Ken Follett?  His earlier works, such as \\"The Key to Rebecca\\" and \\"Eye of the Needle,\\" were well-crafted thrillers.  \\"The Third Twin\\" is sophomorically episodic with every character as stereotypically painted as imaginable.  The novel has little suspense, no interesting characterizations, with foolish plot devices and juvenile twists abound. Ken must be simply churning out the pulp to make a few bucks.  Save your money.

0140277447|4.0|The novel, The Rape of Nanking, by Iris Chang is a detailed account of the human atrocity of the Japanese invasion of Nanking, China before World War II.  Although not a light read, the Rape of Nanking explicitly describes horrific events as well as acts of bravery and heroism that are worth learning about.  The novel approaches the atrocity from several social aspects; the Japanese, Chinese, and foreigners who witnessed the brutal events of the Rape of Nanking.  If the heroic acts of the time went unmentioned in this book, it would be almost unbearable to read.<br />The detail expressed by Chang paints a vivid picture of what it was like to not only witness the attacks of brutality, but to be victimized and live through the attacks as well.  This is a read that will question your beliefs of human morality and make you ask, \\"How could any human be capable of such gross brutality?\\"     <br />People who have heard about the Rape of Nanking will be shocked to learn of the sickening details that have been left out of history or sugar coated.  Chang uncovers the truth, revealing barbaric rapes, mass executions, looting, and many of the other unthinkable acts that were done to the Chinese people.
0743243307|2.0|I was eager to begin this book as I love to read books set in and about people from that part of the world. But this one was a huge disappoitment. <br />Others reviewers have echoed my own feelings about this book so I won't go into the details here; and others have said how much they loved it so this seems to be one of those books readers either love or hate. Certainly, it seems to have struck a nerve with many readers, who seem to have been deeply moved by it. I was simply - bored.<br />Feelings aside:  I do believe it is seriously, objectively flawed on account of the letters written by Nazneem's sister.<br />While they provide a bit of variety  they were an agony to read.  And the question remains as to why they were in broken English;  where did Hasina learn English, and why should she write in English to Nazneem, who did not speak a word of it? But if they were written in Bangladeshi, why \\"pijin\\" Bangla, when that was their native tongue? <br /> The mistakes Hasina would have made - assuming Ali wanted to recreate the lack of formal education - would have been in spelling and grammar. Thus the correct correlation would be misspelt, ungrammatical written English - not the foreigner's English that we were given. <br />Whether one loves or hates the novel, this aspect of it - which after all forms  a major part of the novel - is a huge defect and I wonder why the editor let it pass. Especially as it makes such unnecessarily difficult reading. <br />That said, I will certainly read Ali's next novel and give her a second chance.
6305078181|1.0|Frank Langella breathed new life into the role of Dracula with his performance in this 1979 Broadway adaptation.  I truly had high expectations for the film on DVD but was sorely disappointed with the transfer.  I remember this film having wonderfully vibrant colors but you'll not find them on this disc.  Evidently, the director (John Badham) wanted to make a B&amp;W movie and totally drained the color levels from the transfer to make his vision a reality.<br />Unfortunately, for those of us who are fans of the film as we first experienced it, no tranfer meeting our needs will be forthcoming.  Which is really a shame because this film was very well done and has a killer cast to boot.  Kate Nelligan, Sir Laurence Olivier, Donald Pleasance and Frank Langella just to name a few! <br />If you can get past the bland transfer and the &quot;scratches and hairs&quot; added in post-production for more &quot;effect&quot;, you'll actually have a very good movie on your hands.<br />There was a full-frame(Pan &amp; Scan)DVD version of the film, with its original color released before the Widescreen version was produced.  That version like this current version is also out of print.  Normally I would never recommend a Non-OAR (Original Apect Ratio) version of a film but, if you can find, it get it.
B00004XPPB|5.0|Besides having a great script and superb acting, this film is special for another reason.  Throughout film history many actors have tried to capture the essence of being cool.  James Dean paved the way in his performance in Rebel Without A Cause.  In my opinion, Johnny Depp creates a character that goes to that same level.  It's the type of movie you'll watch over and over.  This is my favorite movie of all time and I think one of the best great actor teams in Pacino and Depp.  Buy this movie if you love a great drama.  If you have a problem with vulgarity, this might not be the movie for you.
B00006BTCA|3.0|Listen. Interpol is a solid band, but better than the 'Furs? I know the Psychedelic Furs may seem like a joke band, now that we're getting 20 years since they made their last relevant record (Talk Talk Talk). But the furs are more than background soundtrack to &quot;Pretty in Pink.&quot; They were a highly relevant post-punk band when post-punk meant something (because back then punk still meant something) and noone honestly knew what the &quot;next step&quot; was going to be. By all means, praise Interpol, but don't diss the 'Furs out of hand. Their 1st two records are landmarks. Interpol should be psyched if their music can stand 20 years of cultural changes and abuse as well as the 'Furs.
B00008DDXC|4.0|How often have I heard, &quot;The book is better than the movie.&quot;? Well, for just about every book that is turned into a motion picture I have! It is a difficult task to take what a reader has seen while reading and project those images on film. The second installment of the Harry Potter series is a success, capturing the feel, characters, and places of Rowling's worlds. This two disc set has plenty of extra features, including deleted scenes, for anyone who wishes to go even further into the world of magic and wizardry.
B0000B3B95|3.0|I am a Hulk fan and after seeing the teaser for the film a summer before it was released I could not wait to see it.  I was a little disapointed.  I was worried about the visual effects, how would the Hulk look.  The Hulk looked incredible, as good as Golum.  The story was not so good.  Not enough action.  Hardly any major emotions-laughter, fear, excitement-did I feel during the movie.  I felt even his tranformation from Banner to the Hulk was understated.  The problem may be that there are fans of the comic book and fans of the tv series.  They should have tried to emulate one or the other.  The movie had too much about Banners early life and not enough HULK SMASH!!!  Maybe they had to show Banners early history so people who are new to the Hulk could understand what was going on but the movie suffered as a result.  In closing I will say that the Hulk looked as real as possible.  Great job in that department.

B00005NB0H|5.0|For anyone who does not regard THE WHO as one of the greatest rock bands ever to play; listening to this album may very well change your mind.  This is by far the hardest The Who have ever rocked.  Each of the band members jam strongly on their instruments, Entwistle plays loud and beautifully, Daltrey howls out the vocals delivered right on time.  This album stands up very nicely to Led Zep 2, and Let it Bleed.<BR> <BR> Almost all of Tommy, a lot of stuff from A QUICK ONE, and a big bundle of their singles can be found on this record being played to their fullest potential.<br /> My personal recommendation:  The Who has a distinct voice that is their own.  But if you like the Stones, Beatles, Hendrix, or Zeppelin, this is an album that should be in your collection.  Favorite cuts: Tattoo, Substitute, Happy Jack, A Quick One, Overture, It's a Boy, Amazing Journey, Acid Queen, and Pinball wizard.  Buy either this or Quadrophenia first, they are the best two WHO albums.
1587990717|1.0|This book is just the ramblings of a smart successful trader who obviously got bored and wanted to write a book.  He speaks more of his philosophical thoughts on random subjects than he does on the math used in his trading system.  If you are looking for a good book on trading - this is not it.  It doesn't explain any trading system or any techniques used.  The math examples aren't more complicated than - there are 100 marbles and 50 are blue and 50 are white....<br />Taleb is obviously a smart man...too smart for his own good.  He tells of how his thinking procludes him from investing in anything but T-Bills because of the mere randomness of the stock market.  According to him everything is random.  From successful traders to successful CEO's.  Hard work and work ethic are wastes of time due to the random nature of everything.  Most traders got lucky by being in the right place at the right time, except him of course.<br />This book is full of ego and personal stories and thoughts from the author, not well organized I might add.  One last example tells it all:  He is so smart he can't see the simple premice behind the book  \\"The Millionaire Next Door\\".  It basically says that the consumers of the world are not the rich, but rather the guy next door driving his 5 year old car with cash in the bank is the millionaire.  It says that savers build wealth and spenders just consume debt.  Simple and true.  Taleb goes on to say how wrong this study is and how rich people are chosen at random like lottery winners.<br />Taleb is the kind of guy you could not enjoy a conversation with for he would be constantly showing off his superior intelect.  The book does have some interesting points and isn't a total waste of time.  If you can ignore all the ego in between.
B00003TL18|5.0|This remarkable recording from September 1987, the only commercially released live album of Roy Orbison's career, is a source of great joy as well as comfort to this Roy Orbison fan.  None of us knew that this recording which ushered in the second coming of rock music's most remarkable voice would soon also stand as a powerful tribute to a man who was to be taken from us far too soon.  With the success of this remarkable live album and the posthumously released Mystery Girl, Roy Orbison went out on top, restored to the level of popularity and immense musical respect he deserved but had not enjoyed during the preceding couple of decades.  Looking back on it now, the last sixteen months of Roy's life could hardly have been scripted any more fittingly.<br />Roy was not alone on the stage for these incredible Coconut Grove sessions.  Around him were a number of superstars in their own right, each of them more than happy to play even a small part in what truly is a great tribute to one of music's undeniable legends.  These included Bruce Springsteen (who once said he wished he could write like Bob Dylan and sing like Roy Orbison), T Bone Burnett, Elvis Costello, Tom Waits, Jackson Browne, K.D. Lang, and Bonnie Raitt.  As for Roy, he was in stellar form.  His voice may not have reflected the power of its youth, but every word from his throat came out mellifluously, and he proved he could still nail the high notes in songs such as Crying and Running Scared.  His voice, to my ears, was incredible and simply ageless; he had not sounded so good in many, many years.  As for the songs, they run the entire gamut of his career, from Move On Down the Line, the first song he ever wrote, to The Comedians and (All I Can Do Is) Dream You, two incredible tracks from the studio album that would turn out to be his last, Mystery Girl.  Many of his classics are here.  No one touched the human heart the way Roy did with classic ballads such as Only the Lonely, In Dreams, Leah, Crying, and Running Scared.  Of course, one can also never forget such rocking classics as Dream Baby, Ooby Dooby, Mean Woman Blues, and Oh Pretty Woman.  Then there is It's Over, perhaps the most moving song of Roy's career and easily my favorite.<br />A Black and White Night Live is the ultimate tribute album to a legendary performer, and the fact that this is the only legitimate live recording of Orbison's career makes this album special beyond words.  I still can't listen to this album without thinking about Roy's passing, but I am comforted at the same time with the knowledge that A Black and White Night Live is really and truly a glorious celebration of this legendary singer's life and career.Running Scared.

B000066I6N|1.0|I really want to like this CD, but I can't.  I found it boring the 1st few times I listened to it, put it down for awhile, and still found it boring weeks later.  It's basically 60's music done a la adult contemporary.  His live performance of this dull material was equally boring.  I have all his CD's (LZ, Honeydrippers, and solo) and this one ranks at the bottom of the list because it goes nowhere.  I've gone to all his concerts in my area and beyond, LZ concerts (way back when), and the Page/Plant concerts (the 2nd round far surpassed the 1st), and the performance of this CD ranks at the bottom also.  I suppose it could be played softly as background music when you're entertaining, but I just can't listen to it for the sake of listening to it.<br />I hate to slam anything he's done, but I've got to be honest.  This CD will put you to sleep.
6304258984|4.0|Featuring Sean Connery, Nicolas Cage and Ed Harris,this is a fast-paced action thriller that is, of course, very well acted and full of energy.<br /><br />The cinematography is topflight, as is the direction, and it will keep you interested until the end, as a good yarn should.<br /><br />I would rate it as an easy five stars except for the message the story-line pushes: that the government has stiffed our combat soldiers and treated them with anonimity, and when they are killed refused to treat their survivors fairly.  This is simply not even remotely true, and for me it almost ruined an otherwise good story.  It was the supposed motivation for the heavy, very well played by Ed Harris (who played John Glenn in The Right Stuff), to lead a terror attack on his own country--a man whom, in the story had won the Congressional Medal of Honor (In my years in the service I met only one such man).  In the story the other military men simpathized with him.  So unlikely an event that it almost made me vomit. I know of what I speak.  I was retired for service-connected disability, and have been very will treated by my grateful nation.<br /><br />The writer also took the usual jabs at J. Edgar Hoover, one of the Hollywood left's favorite targets, and finally insinuated in the conspiracy theory of JFK's death with the clear implication that the government was involved, as well as an allusion to the Roswell 'flying saucer' secrecy conspiracy wherein the U.S. Air Force was supposed to have captured alien spacemen and kept it secret--another kook favorite.<br /><br />This is a fine film, well acted and produced.  Forgive me if I dwell overmuch on the leftist propaganda aspects which are, after all, typical fodder from Hollywood.  But I get very tired of story lines that always, always make our government the bad guy, all in the name of entertainment, and contribute to that image among people who know no better.<br /><br />It WAS good entertainment.  I'm probably just too politically inclined to give an objective view.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret.)<br /><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<br />and other bookstically inclined to give an objective view.<br /><br />Joseph (Joe) Pierre, USN (Ret.)<BR><br />author of Handguns and Freedom...their care and maintenance<BR>and other books
B000002C25|5.0|Few people outside the uk can appreciate the impact that oasis had on British music. To put it simply, it was awful. Until one day in early 1994, we caught a glimpse of the band that changed it all.<BR>Their first album was brilliant, with four great singles including the classics live forever and supersonic. It also had great songs such as 'Bring It On Down' and 'Columbia'. The follow up, (whats the story) morning glory? was the biggest selling album in britain in the 90's and one of the biggest ever. It wasn't as good as the first in my eyes, but the singles 'some might say', 'wonderwall', and 'roll with it'all became anthems that still get huge airplay here 9 years later, and 'don't look back in anger' was voted in the top 7 singles of all time.<BR>So they'd done it, they conquered Britain and most of the world. The hardest thing now was the follow up. When Be Here Now was released in the UK the queues outside the record stores stretched for hundreds of metres. However, people were very quick to write it off. The opening track, 'd'yer know what i mean' is a really catchy tune, with a great bridge and chorous, and the 7 mins just fly by. 'My Big Mouth' is a loud, mainly tuneless air guitar track that is one of my favourites.<BR>'Magic Pie' is probably the weakest track, and at 7 mins is far too long. Although Noels voice sounds good on it, it could probably have been left out for another song that didn't make it onto the album, such as 'stay young' or 'ive got the fever'. <br />The next two tracks are probably the stand outs. 'Stand by me' would have reached number 1 in England, though due to the tragic death of princess Diana and the success of the charity single it missed out by a few thousand copies. It is a beautiful slow ballad with an anthem chorus. 'I hope, I think, I know'is a fast, uplifting, pop-rock tune with a great melody and another brilliant chorus.<BR>'The girl in the dirty shirt' and 'fade-in out'are both good songs, the latter famous because it features the actor johnny depp on guitar towards the end of the track. 'Don't go away' is another classic, although never released here it is a great rock ballad and gets huge airplay on most rock stations here. The title track is the customary 'fun track 9' song on the album, and has a nice little whistle bit in it. <BR>'all around the world is another number 1 in the uk, although i dont know what the band were on when they recorded it, as it goes on for almost ten minutes. The next track is also a mammoth effort, at 7 mins again, although this time it is my favourite on the cd and anyone who likes rock music will love it.<BR>In all, this album lives up to the reputation the first two created. It is a must have in any decent record collection, and it remains the highest selling Britpop record of all time, and the fastest selling ever in the world. Buy It.
B00006JL1Z|4.0|This is an excellent, comprehensive FM collection from the Buckingham/Nicks era of the group, with a little from the Brunette/Vito era sprinkled in near the end of the set for good measure.<br />BUT, Fleetwood Mac fans definately need a compliation this magnitude that spans 1967-1974  (pre-Buckingham/Nicks era).<br />Such material as: Station Man, Sentimental Lady, Hypmotized, Black Magic Woman, Albertross, Oh Well (Parts 1&amp;2), as well as others.<br />The only other quibble I have is all the &quot;Later&quot; material is near the end of the set. And what makes &quot;World Turning&quot; or &quot;Family Man&quot; that great to warrent being on a &quot;Best of Collection&quot;?  A head scratcher for sure. I would have gone for &quot;Blue Letter&quot; and &quot;Save Me&quot; (SM being a top 40 hit!)  I remember &quot;Save Me&quot; was on the radio a lot where I lived.<br />Oh well. <br />Bottom Line: A very good compilation of hits and key album tracks.  The single mixes are a nice touch as well as including the studio version of &quot;Silver Springs&quot;.  There just needs to be a compilation of the &quot;older&quot; Fleetwood Mac material out there. As another reviewer stated &quot;there was life before the Buckingham/Nicks era of Fleetwood Mac.&quot;

B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I first heard of this band through my friend. He let me listen to the &quot;Sounding of The Seventh Trumpet&quot; album, and I think it was pretty cool. There was some good guitar, but basically it sounded too much like every hardcore band around like Atreyu, Poison THe Well, etc. But a few weeks ago I bought Madden 2004 for Gamecube and I heard this song in the background and I was like &quot;That sounds really cool. Who is that?&quot; and I checked and saw that it was Avenged Sevenfold and I was like wow this is some really good stuff. The lead singer sounds alot like Chris Jericho from Fozzy which is a really nice touch. The album seems to me like it's more melodic that their past efforts. This is a very dark album and I've loved it ever since my first listen. The whole album is great, not a single bad track. This is now in my Top Albums of the year list, it is number 3 behind Alkaline Trio and Iron Maiden, it's just really phenomenal stuff and it's perfect for any fan of classic metal, emo, screamo, punk, hardcore, etc. it's just so great
B000000WG4|5.0|&quot;Tubular bells&quot; - propably his best album up to the date.and please,do not buy &quot;TB2003&quot; because the biggest emostions and power are still laying in this famous raw seventies version...<BR>Mike creates rich soundscapes using manny different instruments,the melodies are flowing one into another and some are suddenly dissapearning giving place for new exciting tunes...sometimes it is relaxing (Opening theme),Sometimes funny (the caveman in part 2 - MIke sings it himself) but always ful of beautifulness.the part 1 is most famous one but the part 2 is really much more emotional - the gentle guitar collages are so melanchoic that they will make you cry...<BR>a must have album for everyone!
0684853523|4.0|I'm a long-time King fan. Recently, I read his solid, somewhat literary collection of short stories, &quot;Everything's Eventual,&quot; and was blown away by his foreword to the book, in which he talks a lot about how he has tried to stretch the boundaries of the short story, the novel and the serial novel. <br />If that wasn't fascinating enough, he went on to talk about how he has also tried to experiment with the marketing of his work (he goes into detail about the unsuccessful Internet-only marketing of &quot;The Plant&quot;).  Imagine -- Stephen King, bestselling writer, talking turkey about marketing. Very interesting indeed!<br />I expected &quot;On Writing&quot; to include more of the same information about how King writes and how the books get sold. In &quot;On Writing,&quot; King certainly talks about his process, as well as some nuts-and-bolts aspects of writing, but the book is quite personal and never goes into the business aspects of writing and publishing. That's not the point of &quot;On Writing.&quot; <br />So what is the point? Well, look at the title. The book is primarily a memoir. The first section of the book is full of anecdotes from King's childhood -- the events that made him a writer. They're fun and not terribly profound, and he tells the readers to expect as much. <br />The  section of the book that's the how-to-write section is, I feel, full of things you can read in other books about writing. King is aware of this, and keeps it short and sweet.  My grammar is far from perfect, but I really could have done without the section about grammar. Does anybody read a Stephen King book for the grammar?<br />The value of the how-to-write section lies in the metaphors King constructs to illuminate for the reader why certain conventions of writing work the way they do; why they are important. These metaphors are down-to-earth and just might mean something to a new writer who's struggling with the basics.  <br />The last part of the book is a wrenching account of the accident that nearly killed King in 1999. This part of the book held my interest most completely, because it was the only part that didn't already seem familiar to me.  King long recovery included a writing crisis, which is why the story of the accident is included in &quot;On Writing.&quot;<br />In general, I think there are better books about writing/becoming a writer/living the writing life, but this book is certainly a must-read for any King fan. I particularly appreciated hearing how King's wife, Tabitha, has been so supportive over the years (without taking any B.S., either!), and the list of King's favorite books.
B00005B36H|5.0|it is more sublime than \\"Aenima\\" or \\"Undertow\\" - it feels that tool grown up during that 5 years of silence between LATERALUS and AENIMA.<BR>all compositions are much more interesting because of specific melodies and rhytmic accents (\\"schism\\",\\"Lateralis\\").Maynard vocalsc are magnificent as usualy.<BR>get it - the best tool album!
0061020710|4.0|Writing a good parody is fiendishly difficult.  If you don't believe me, try it yourself.  While the fantasy genre overflows with cliches and trite, formulaic writing, an effective satire of it needs to do more than just point out those overused ideas.  Such a novel would soon grow boring.  And that's the good thing about &quot;The Color of Magic&quot;: it isn't satisfied with just making a few lame jokes over and over again.  There's at least one new punchline on almost every page.  Is it a good punchline?  Usually.  Many people have compared Pratchett to Douglas Adams.  I don't think that he's quite that good in this book, but he comes close.  As with Adams, some of the best jokes come during brief diversions that pop up to explore some background point, without any real relevance to the story.  And yes, there are a few instances where the joke isn't quite as funny as the author seems to think, but overall the book is well worth reading.
B000021YQV|3.0|loud,heavy but lacks of variety.i love some tracks from here but the whole album is overrated.the music in many tracks is just loud without any idea what to do after verse or chorus.but still the lyrics are cool...&quot;Pushing little children with the full lip automatic&quot;
B00005JKHN|5.0|This film is absolutely without a doubt one of Disney's best.  I remember seeing Sleeping Beauty in theaters when it was re-released in some theaters back in 1995. Since then I had been looking for a VHS copy of the movie. Well I got a DVD player and was REALLY happy when I found out that Sleeping Beauty was coming out on DVD. The restoration process is beautiful. This movie is a classic. Seeing this movie again has brought back memories of my childhood when I would watch this movie several times a day.
B00005V9HH|5.0|Unlike most suspense thrillers,'Usual Suspects' remains interesting even after multiple viewings. Its charm is not dependent on suspense alone.Its true force comes from the acting by the main leads and the narrative technique followed by Bryan Singer. Just when one story thread appears to be in the danger of going limp, there emerges another much tauter. The screenplay is such a deviously contrived maze that almost every character appears to be lost at one point or another.<BR>Some people complain about the contrived ending. But why ending alone? The whole plot is a contrivance. More mportant than the plausibility element, I think it's the entertainment angle that's really taken care of. And it's pretty cerebral at that.<BR>One of the pleasures of this move is that it makes you care about some of the main characters. You wonder what kind of a life Verbal leads in private. Or what would Keaton be doing if he hadn't got hooked? Was there a real Keyser Soze? <BR>You don't see many movies these days that make you feel that way.
B0000BYM3K|4.0|Wow, this isn't Number of the Beast or Piece of Mind, but is certainly NEW Iron Maiden! I have not been able to get this disc out of my player since I left the store. So many bands follow the crazy music trends and put out garbage instead of what they're best at. Dance of Death offers no hip-hop, no metal-rap, no dj's and no repetetive commercial [stuff]!<br />I gotta say, this disc is all about Maiden-2003. It is exaclty what I would expect from them, hard driving, melodic and yes, it is definitely based on the depth and intensity that Dickinson and Harris always put into their work.<br />I highly recommend this disc for any Maiden fan, old and new alike! It offers something for everyone and is solid proof that Maiden will stand the test of time and that they reign as the ultimate kings of heavy metal!
B000001ESN|5.0|great album,great melodies - nothing more nothing less.if you like rush you will love this.Progressive rock heaven
B00008J4P5|5.0|I bought this CD on a whim due to the uncanny ability of &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; to stick in my head and I can only say this is an absolutely incredible album. My personal favorites now are &quot;Black Math&quot; and &quot;Ball and Biscuit.&quot; For a time I did not fully realize what exactly drew me so intensely to it until someone said to me regarding the Whites &quot;I'm not into classic rock.&quot; Then it hit me: as a lover of late-60's to early-80's rock from S&amp;G to the Stones to early punk, this album works some magic to recall to mind the days when rock was what I would hesitate to call &quot;pure&quot; but seems to avoid description otherwise. <BR>Oh, and don't let the quirky cover fool you: this album does not contain a shread of gimic. Elephant is packed with very solid lyrics and some truly amazing electric guitar passages that make me keep turning up the volume. I find it hard to get all the way through this CD becuase I keep wanting to hear the songs over again as soon as they have finished.
B00000253N|5.0|Yes, this is one of Dylans all time classics. Unlike the albums that lead up to his motorcycle accident, which are hip and electric, this one is for quiet listening. Close the room, sit down, and let yourself be taken over by the stories Dylan tells of love, joints, and lost moments. Phantastic... even though it leaves you a bit gloomy. Strange that Dylan is really at his best when hes suffering...
B000022TSH|5.0|This film, in its entirety, is only getting better with age.  For those that have not seen it, that's alright.  It's not the catchiest, flashiest cover art at first glance. But just like the film itself, the cover art demands closer inspection.  A true classic can truly be determined by the test of time.  When I first saw this film I thought it was good, it didn't move me that way it does now.  Just after it ended, however, I found myself replaying the scenes in my head, over and over.  I must have watched it again within a week or two.  Soon after that I bought it, and it is now a film I cherish deeply.  <BR>Roman Polanski's cinematic translation of Robert Towne's script is beyond words.  Every scene is pristine, but delicate.  Every shot intentional for a colorized film noir feel, yet the stylization never feels intrusive.<BR>Jack Nicholson.  What can I saw about Jack?  One of his best performances- up there with One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest and About Schmidt. <BR>I love this film, and so will you.  If not, give it another chance down the road, I promise you won't be disappointed.
B00005JKZT|5.0|I was crazy not to watch The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers in the theaters because if that film looked THAT amaZinG on my own big screen tv at home (which it did) then Oh MY...i could only imagine how spectacular, how intensifying it would look on the giant silver screen.  <br />This sequel engaged me from beginning to end.  I learned to love several characters while hating others.  Never has the battle of good versus evil looked so awing.  You know how after you keep seeing the good guys win again and again in so many films that you kinda get sick of it and wish the bad guys would conquer for once?? well...I can almost guarantee you will be rootin' on tHeSe good men til the very end.  I mean, their sheer passion to protect what is good, upright and noble is so compelling that you can almost taste the blood spilt on their behalf.  You are so much drawn into every scene that you almost forget your own surroundings.  <br />Unlike the first movie The Fellowship of the Ring, this second film focuses more on each individual character for the nine original members of the fellowship have split up into three different subgroups (as you see at the end of the first movie).  This allows for a larger scope of action that will bind you to your seat.  And is it just me or do those Oks keep getting uglier and uglier?? *shudders* haha  Clearly, this film isn't big on romance, but if you're curious to see if it follows the blossoming love between Aragorn and Arwen the daughter of the master elf...they do have some brief but substantial scenes together.<br />I have several favorite scenes in this film--all of which are parts in the battle of Helm's Deep (or is it Keep?).  I won't say exactly what they are so as not to spoil it for those of you who have not yet seen Two Towers.  It is all very exciting tho and sincerely impressive I must say.  This has to be my favorite movie of the year and that says alot because I usually favor romantic comedies.  Two Towers is filled with  action, adventure, lust, and emotion.  They call the great battle: the War of the Ring.  I call it the war of good vs. evil.  They did an awesome job of creating the special effects...and the animated characters possess so much realism that you may think they are people dressed in costume and an extreme amount of makeup.<br />I must add, if you are a huge fan of the handsome Legolas (Orlando Bloom)--like I am (of course ;) hehe)--you will be happy to find that he has more parts in this one than first.  And he shows off his fighting skills in addition to his expert archery talent.  Hmmm...and I have to say...i love it when he speaks Elf...it's smooth...rich and sexy! haha<br />Basically, if you loved the first one, you will be enchanted by its sequel (Two Towers) and I am more than anxious to see the final addition to the trilogy (The Return of the King) for I'm sure it will not dissapoint. =)  As long as they keep making 'em, I'm gonna keep seeing 'em. ;)
B000099T2L|3.0|I bought Beyonce's solo debut album because I was helping the whole support Destiny's Child thing. Plus &quot;Crazy In Love&quot; is an alright song. I was reading the credits and basically most of her songs are sampled and therefore unoriginal. The songs are ok and they are not that bad but it could have been more original for a solo debut. Songs that should NOT have been on the album is &quot;Speechless&quot; and &quot;Gift from Virgo&quot;--- WHAT WAS SHE THINKING it sounds like unorganized junk. The highlightes of the CD is &quot;Dangerously In Love 2&quot;-- it sound the same as &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; (From &quot;Survivor&quot;) so the &quot;2&quot; is dumb.. I like Michelle's voice in that song.. &quot;Hip Hop Star&quot; is nice but different and I can't listen to it that much but it is a definite highlight.. &quot;Dangerously In Love&quot; is a satisfactory effort on Knowles' part. But I think you should go and but Michelle Williams' &quot;Heart To Yours&quot; or Kelly Rowland's &quot;Simply Deep&quot; unless you really want to buy the CD for the risque pictures.
B00005JKDR|5.0|I picked up this DVD in the hopes my daughter would enjoy it. She was rather young to watch a full length movie at the time. However I would like to say that I found it rather enjoyable.The story is original and you cannot say enough about the Pixar animation. I can now say it is one of my favorite animated movies!!!!Maybe I really picked it up for myself...........
B000008B01|5.0|What can I say, this album is breathtaking. Totally worth the money.  With jsut Joao and his guitar, each song is pensive and intimate.  Especially hearing him sing a solo version of Aguas de Marco was the best.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|As a follow up to Brave New World I wasnt sure if Dance of Death would hold up, I shouldnt have worried, where Brave New World gave us an album reflecting Iron Maiden at there best (somewhere around Powerslave to Seventh Son), Dance of Death takes the classic Maiden sound and reinvigorates it for the 21st century.<BR>I wasnt sure what to expect when it appeared Harris, long the songwriting center for the band, seemed to have taken a backseat on the album, but the involvement of everyone on the album has come up aces - from McBrains New Frontier to Murrays on Age of Innocence, to Smith with the pick of the album Paschendale. To me every song has strengths and a sound that I found appealing, even Gates of Tomorrow which while not the best of the album is far from a low point.<BR>The thing Ive always loved about Maiden is that you always come away and learn something , this album offers Montsegur, which melds the historical and legendary aspects of the  Cathar defiance at Montsegur agains the spanish inquisition. Paschendale offers a feeling for the horror of the WW1 battlefield.<BR>The album offers a great blend of songs both in length and style (epic to single format), always having been a big fan of the epic songs I think Dance of Death offers the best of their single length songs. Caping it off is the accustic Journeyman. While not the first metal band to bring orchestral backing to the music, the inclusion of it on Dance of Death is used well,  adding a depth to the album and offering something new, while finding a superior replacement to the synthetic sound they used to the late 80`s. <BR>So to end its a great album, if your a long time fan I hope you enjoy this album as much as I have been, if new to Iron Maiden there should be plenty so to please here.
B00006LLNV|5.0|The entire CD is amazing.  So passionate, it pains.  The very last track, Burning Bed, sung by Caetano Veloso and Lila Downs is just so beautiful and what a way to end an album! This is a LIFE CD! BUY IT!  Although I bought mine thru my CD club, BMG, it was cheaper, at $5 no s/h. Try [...]<br />The enhancements on the CD were great too. It showed the tango scene as well as Salma in the recording studio.
B00007BHOE|5.0|This DVD kicks bum. This DVD goes to show to all Slipknot haters why we love this  band. How could somebody not like them after watching this? The best part about it watching Joey #1 on the multi-angle. Buy this DVD now if your a TRUE Maggot.
0716703440|3.0|Virtually everyone who works or who worked or who would like to work in GR brags up this book and boasts of reading it from cover to cover.  Most have not.  I, unfortunately, have.  It rambles and is scatterbrained and halfa* on many topics.  The would be investigator would be better off following another course of study in differential topology and differential geometry, almost any other relativity text or texts, and the literature.  It should be kept in mind, however, that when this book was first published the global methods were like lie algebra was at one time - researchers writing papers for and to each other with nobody else in mind.  This was a supposed attempt to make the material available to a wider audience. It may have degenerated into intellectual onanism.
B00005JKZV|5.0|I personally thought the first film was more successful but The Two Towers is a great film in its own right and anyone who understands the language of cinema or works in the industry is not going to dispute that.<br />Its sad and almost embarrassing the way people don't understand the difference media can make to a story.  Yes, changes have been made, but they've been made for a reason - story pacing, film structure, tension etc...<br />Anyone who's a fan of cinema is going to enjoy this film.  If you're a fan of tolkein who perhaps doesn't really understand film or are visually illiterate (my 5 year old could produce a piece of modern art),  don't bother seeing this.
B00008J4P5|5.0|I detested the White Stripes because of that poppy single &quot;Fell In Love With a Girl&quot;. Then I heard the awesome riff on &quot;Seven Nation Army&quot; and fell in love. This album was created in the purest state without the mixing and studio hype. That is what makes this album A CLASSICK ROCK REVIVAL. I couldn't shake &quot;The Air Near My Fingers&quot; and &quot;You've Got Her In Your Pocket&quot;.  Now I have to add the rest of their discography to my collection. It is nice to finally hear some truly soulful rock going back to it's roots. Clapton would be proud
B0000BYM3K|5.0|For the first time in a long while I put a CD in and didn'y want it to end. Dance of Death is the best Iron Maiden album since Bruce left oh so many years back. 3 lead guitar players, 1 great drummer. 1 of the best bass players to ever play an instrument. And then theres Bruce....After all these years he can still sing his a** off. Dance of Death reminds me of Maiden of old. Pounding drums, thumping bass lines, great guitar licks, typically awesome lyrics. A GREAT ALBUM!!!!!
B0000BYM3K|5.0|If you are a true Maiden fan like me than you need to get this album now! Iron Maiden is like fine wine, they just get better with age. This album contains everything on it to be a great album, killer riffs, harmonies, melodies and of course great singing. And the best thing about this album is that it came out on my birthday and it was an awesome birthday present indeed! So dont waste any time and do yourself a favor GET THIS ALBUM NOW!!! UP THE IRONS
0800177177|3.0|...<br />Case in point, Bram Stoker's Dracula. A Francis Ford Coppola movie. That's right, the greatest filmmaker of the last fifty years apparently drank too much of his Napa Valley wine and cast a non-actor like Keanu Reeves in his remake of Dracula. The rest of the cast is actually good, except for Winona Ryder....<br />Too bad Coppola didn't hire Kate Winslet for the role of Mina. ... Just about anyone would have made a better Jonathan Harker - and I do mean ANYONE! I doubt Steven Seagal could have performed a worse British accent. Worst of all was the scene in which Harker (Reeves) tells Van Helsing \\"I know where the BAWSTAHD sleeps -Carfax Abbey!\\" Not even John Travolta in Battlefield Earth, Elizabeth Berkely in Showgirls or Kevin Costner in Robin Hood, not since Rob Lowe sang \\"Proud Mary\\" to Snaow White at the Oscars, has an \\"actor\\" done something so unintentionally hilarious! Speaking of Costner, he must have sighed in relief to know that thanks to Keanu Reeves in Dracula, he is now responsible for only the second worst English accent in the history of movies!<br />Speaking of [weak] accents (Dracula attracts them like molasses attracts flies), why do the actors who play Van Helsing insist on doing the most ridiculous Dutch accents? Olivier was over-the-top in Badham's Dracula and Anthony Hopkins (tongue planted firmly in cheek) in Coppola's version. They sound like Goldmember! The two best Van Helsings were Peter Cushing and Nigel Davenport, neither of whom offered Dracula a \\"shmoke and a pancake\\". <br />Everyone else is good in the movie, though. Even Tom Waits. Bill Campbell and Cary Elwes and Richard Grant are all very good and should have got more screen time -especially if it meant less time for you-know-who. Gary Oldman is brilliant, as usual. However, Sadie Frost steals the show as Lucy. <br />The costumes, while not historically accurate, are amazing. The cinematography is among the most beautiful I've ever seen. The old-school special effects are great, too. ... <br />All these factors make Dracula worth a look -especially if you can fast-forward through the scenes with Keanu Reeves.
B00008PX8P|3.0|It's amazing how time and expanding your musical horizons can change your perspective on a band. When I was a kid I was very much into Led Zeppelin, which in the 80's was not the coolest thing to be into. I worshipped them, but after seeing The Song Remains the Same I was a little less impressed. Later as I became a musician myself I came to the conclusion that those performances were just plain *bad*, sloppy and lazy playing throughout. Having heard rumours that this new Led Zeppelin DVD redeemed them as a live band I had to check it out. Yet I am still left with the conclusion that they were not that great, especially in comparison to some of the red hot bands around today. Page was a wizard in the studio, but his live playing is just way too sloppy to the point of being embarassing at times, but seeing as it was his band, nobody was going to tell him that. The rest of the band does pretty well, John Paul Jones being probably the most skilled musician. Plant in his day could sing like nobody's business and it's worth getting the DVD for that alone (namely the 1970 Albert Hall performance) and John Bonham could certainly wack those drums when he wasn't totally inebriated. I just wish Page would play less and more accurately.
B0000BYM3K|5.0|Their second album since frontman Bruce Dickinson and guitarist Adrian Smith reunited with Maiden (the first being Brave New World), this is a another great effort from one of rock's legendary bands. The signature Maiden guitarwork is here...intricate and alluring, sometimes hypnotic and sometimes explosive.  The two tracks dealing with battles (Montsegur &amp; Paschendale) are among the best, with Paschendale rivaling past Iron Maiden epics such as Rime Of The Ancient Mariner.  The title track is a whirlwind affair also deserving epic status, and songs like Wildest Dreams, Rainmaker, and Age Of Innocence are just catchy as hell.  Bruce's vocals shine througout, none better than on Journeyman, an absolutely beautiful arrangement of acoustic guitars and orchestral strings that leave you in awe...a perfect way to close out the album.  These guys simply show no signs of slowing down...Up The Irons again!
B0000AI44Q|5.0|i can't believe that (of all the people who wouldn't) i would underestimate Neil Young. ..and all the reviewers i find usually lazy are even lazier than i thought. i'd like to call them dumb because that would be a better excuse. but that is an excuse they need to come up with themselves. i didn't write this review to 'help' you - i did it to provoke you. i can only say that you owe it to yourself as a human being to throw your t.v. set out the window for the day and listen to this. If you make the effort, by the time you go back out to look for the t.v. it will be gone. ...and if &quot;When I was young people wore what they had on.&quot;  isn't one of the great rock 'n' roll lines of all time, then my friend was right when he said i never really lived here anyway.  Maybe i lived in Greendale.
B0000AXE8I|4.0|It often suprises me how often Individuals who watch SciFi/Fantasy films often expect to get some sort of real life meaning from them. I watch films like the matrix(Reloaded) for its entertainment value only. was I entertained? YOU BET. The special EFX were awsome and the Digital Dolby Soundtrack was at the very least was as good if not better than I could get sitting at home. Like Star trek, Star Wars and a 100 others you could name its pure fantasy not reality,. So remember,when you set off to see the Matrix(Revolutions)Grab a bag of popcorn(get a special if you like) sit back and watch the fun, after all its only a Movie.
B00000JCOV|4.0|OK, if you want a serious musical record that is the height of human achievement, go get something by Sigur Ros, Radiohead, Pink Floyd, or any of the other bands I rave about in my reviews. If you want a serious metal album, Opeth, In Flames, and The Dillinger Escape Plan are good bets. <BR> <BR>This is something that can (and should) not be taken seriously. However, it is one HELL of a fun album to blast while hanging out with friends or play in the middle of the night when your physics paper is due the next day. This is not the Greatest Musical Recording In History... just a bunch of guys banging on their instruments and screaming hillariously demented and obscene lyrics. (for example:  &quot;You can't see California without Marlon Brando's eyyeeeeeessssss!&quot;). Funny thing is, the main drummer and the lead guitarist are actually quite good. <br />Bottom line: if you want a good time, buy this CD used.
B00008EY9G|2.0|Both the story and the director's style of telling it grab you from the start.  It reminded me of &quot;Memento&quot; (which I greatly admire) for the first few scenes in the way that it seemed to be progressing backwards, but then it settled into a more conventional narrative.  The lead characters are drawn well enough that I was invested in their stories; I was especially sympathetic to John Cusack's character. It's classic murder mystery fair with a twist.  Ten strangers find themselves stranded by a storm in a creepy motel. One of them is a cop who's transporting a psychopathic killer. Another is a man desperate to get his seriously injured wife to a hospital, but the roads are flooded and the phones are down.  When one by one they start turning up dead, it's a game of wits between the viewer and the screenwriter to figure out who's doing it. Obviously, all is not as it seems.  But when the true nature of the characters was revealed, I felt cheated, bamboozled, duped and angry. I wanted to fire off a nasty letter to the director and the writer; instead, I'm writing this review.  The much ballyhooed double twist at the end is not of &quot;The Sixth Sense&quot; variety; the kind of jaw dropping revelation that makes you go, &quot;whooooa&quot;. No, this ending pulled the rug out from under all of the caring and compassion I had invested in the characters. When the end credits rolled, I hit the stop button in disgust. Without revealing the ending, I can't go into justifying my reaction and I know lots of people disagree from all of the positive reviews I've read.  I guess this is one of those love it or hate it kind of films that you should definitely rent before you buy to see which category you fall into.
B00006879E|5.0|This whole album is great from beginning to end. Amongst all the candy coated sugar pop that is ever so popular now, this album stands light years above the rest. The songs you could listen to repeatedly and like it just as much as the first time you listened. The sound is unlike any thing I've heard. An eclectic sound mixed with the lead singers beautiful voice makes this album the best release of 2003. I encourage everyone to buy this album without hesitation.
B00005JLSE|5.0|I am going to get say to simplely. This is a great musical, that won 6 Acadmeny awards. By the second time, or the first with the subtiles, you will be singing along. This about a murderess, well mostly two murderess. They are both in CHICAGO. They on Muderess Row, in the Cook Country Jail. They are Velma Kelly and Roxie Hart. Velma works on the stage. Roxie dreams about it. Whenever, she can't deal with something, she dreams about acts on the stage. Roxie shot and killed a man she was sleeping with who was supposed to get her a job as a singer/dancer, but didn't. Velma was at the Hotel Circeo and caught her husband and her sister fooling around. Queen Latifah plays Mama, the women who runs the jail. Richard Gere plays Billy Flynn, the slick lawyer of Roxie and Velma.
B0000640VO|5.0|This movie is the best foreign flick of the year. Granted that some people may mind that it is in french, but if you just get over that fact, you will love it. It's very funny and &quot;cute&quot; and the humour in it is rather simple. I recomend this movie to any movie fan, particulirement  ceux qui parlent franais. Je l'adore.
B00007KQA3|4.0|Michael Radford's production of \\"1984\\" is not a typical Hollwood/bastardization of George Orwell's classic novel--thank the Lord that Radford was not forced, as was Terry Gilliam with \\"Brazil,\\" to alter this bleak picture of a posssible future world as seen from 1948--the year Orwell wrote the novel.       In this version--there have been a few others--care was taken to be faithful to the novel, and the producers appeared to have a freehand to shock the audience with both the novel's sexual aspects & the inhumanity of O'Brien and the other members of the Inner Party.  (Note--the film is worthy of its rating and might have gotten an X or NC17 in a more puritan society.)  The acting of John Hurt is outstanding and Richard Burton's last tole proves to the viewer how good an actor Burton was when given a good script and a good director.       There has been some some complaints about the lack of the music by the Eurythmics.  Having seen both versions of the film and owning a cassette of the Eurythmics contribution, I feel that the film works better without the additional music.  (Note--their work was fine and \\"Julia\\" was a haunting song.)  I say this because in such a world as Orwell and Radford depict, I feel that the only music that fits is the music that the Party allows--songs written by machines and the song of the children, the telescreen's fanfare and the Oceania anthem.  These small pices of music tell the whole story and thie limited use helps to create the bleakness of a society based upon a boot continually striking a human's face and the need to worship Big Brother.  An outstanding film!
