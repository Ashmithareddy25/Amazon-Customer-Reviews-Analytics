B00127RAJY|5.0|I've only been doing this a couple weeks but I think I am seeing a noticeable difference. Great workout that has me feeling good throughout the whole day.
B003L77GGK|5.0|Love the series. I like to watch one after another. Couldn't get enough.  I guess you would have to be into the Supernatural series to really enjoy. I would recommend this series.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Enjoyed this book.  Wanted to read it before the movie came out.  I Liked the plot and discovering these two, though at times it does get a bit redundant in the information. But a good read over all.
1449410243|5.0|Typical and expected oatmeal humor. First dolphin book was great, this one is also.<br />Must buy if you are an oatmeal fan.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Love this movie and we love the combo pack we have. Digital copies are a must so that we can put them on our iPad and take the movies on the road to keep the 2 year old entertained. Great movie, great price!
B002JVWRAO|5.0|Love the series. I like to watch one after another. Couldn't get enough.  I guess you would have to be into the Supernatural series to really enjoy. I would recommend this series.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|You will fall in love with these characters and long to have there kind of love. Understanding Chris`s predicament gives you a whole new insight.
B00AN0KGWE|5.0|The first word that comes to mind is the word riveting.  I can't wait for Season 3.  Money very well spent.
0425263916|5.0|I bought this for my wife because she liked the first one so much.  She loved this one and I have already have the next on pre-ordered.
B004YM6JI2|5.0|Love the series. I like to watch one after another. Couldn't get enough.  I guess you would have to be into the Supernatural series to really enjoy. I would recommend this series.
B005CRQ4GU|1.0|the book is so awesome I keep reading it over and over I will never remove this book from my device
B00992CF6W|4.0|These should be added so like to make people read and add these: minecraft needs iron golems,roses,cobble walls, redstone,different shades of wooden planks,potions, xp, and enchantment table
B009UX2YAC|5.0|One of the best free games I love the surgery game once it was uppdated it would be better if you could choose your tracks
B00BESKTMG|4.0|Yea.. I saw some of the reviews here knocking it down a bit. Don't come for the story, which wasn't all that bad. It was a fun movie, light, easy to watch. Russell Crowe did a job job in his role.
0393078299|5.0|Tells the story in a detective novel like way, of the debate at the beginning of the Quantum Mechanics Theory rise to glory.  Great insight into all the famous names of modern physics: Bohr, Heisenberg, Einstein . .  the list goes on and on. What was particularly interesting was the depiction of the debates and personal biases of these great Physicists.  This is very readable for non science people.  Being a physics major in college, I LOVED it . . .  no math required.
B0069JBKHI|3.0|Great and easy setup.  However, we found the video lag too long, so it ends up being an audio monitor with still frames of your child.  Its a bit too pricy for an audio monitor.  We are returning it and going with Foscam cameras.  The setup is more complicated, but once you have it up and running the video and audio are great.
B009EEFTMC|5.0|Very fun and addicting game. Love it. Glad I purchased this game. This is a keeper. It works as a good mind refresher.
B0012239EE|4.0|I love Josh Groban, and this album is no exception, but I bought this album for the eponymous song, assuming it would be in there. I had to find it on another album and buy it separately - I'd buy a different version next time.
B000058983|5.0|Classic Love... when Love got more sophisticated and added jazz-ish stuff to the songs.  A must for your collection of 1960's music.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|I lived this scenario of a hundred number one priority projects from  uncoordinated and unfocused corporate business units. Even after priorities were filtered and reconciled, and applications were virtualized on shared hardware, the IT budget for each project had to be spent on procurement of specific data center assets to get approval from the business sponsor! What a waste of energy just because business folks can't view IT as a service provider on contract much like outside attorneys or accountants.
B0085Z8F4A|4.0|Look like some other space movies  but I like the trama<br />and the final as lkike the end never end
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Awesomeness the most awesome book ever. The best book I have ever read, I don't know how anyone could dislike this fantastic book.
B00007LTIA|5.0|Saw the Tales from Topographic Oceans Tour back in early 70's.  They decorated the stage completely with Roger Dean-like props and effects . . . awesome.  Read the wikipedia article on the album.  Apparently Jon Anderson had read The Autobiography of a Yogi and it inspired this album.
B00AIUUXHC|5.0|I find myself playing this game often when I am bored. It's incredibly addicting to grow your shark bigger and bigger.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|So easy to use and I can clean up my Kindle to keep it optimal working order in just a few taps.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I thought this game was well thought out, and highly addictive. I recommend it to anyone that likes to figure out puzzles. :D
B00BHMETKC|5.0|you knew the outcome going in and yet it was still exciting, anxiety producing and fun to watch.  well done mr. affleck all the kudos are well deserved
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|I am glad that I saw this movie. An absolutely unconventional but highly admirable story line with excellent performance by Helen Hunt. Triumph of the human spirit in away. Highly recommended.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|Works great on the Kindle if you remember to turn up your volume before use. I love it and use it nightly.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|my 4 year old and I love this app. everyday she wants to play so she can check on her horse and take care of her. amazing graphics.
B00B2GK4KW|5.0|First I received the punches and I was anxious to try them out. So when the starter kit came I tried it and loved it!!<br />I showed some of my friends (cardmakers and scrapbookers) and they are very enthousiatic! Easy to use. I was a bit sceptic at first, because it looked so easy on the commercial. But it really is that easy!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Too much  texting. I AM NOT SURE IF I WILL READ THE NEXT BOOK .  IT SOUNDS LIKE THE AUTHOR  IS VERY EXPERIENCED.
B009O2XY12|5.0|I enjoy playing this game when I find myself with some down time, especially when I am whining down for bed.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Another good one from these guys. I like the graphics and all the mini games. I usually don't buy the full version but I had to on this one.
0061148512|4.0|At this point it seems nearly impossible to write anything original about The Bell Jar, and just as impossible to write about this novel without referencing its thinly fictionalized rendering of her own breakdown, early suicide attempt, and hospitalization.<br /><br />It's ironic that Plath, herself, downplayed the importance of this book. There's so much here: a memoir-like telling of an bright and ambitious young woman's psychological break and climb toward recovery, the conflict of her ambitious career-minded self with the girl who wants to find a &#34;nice boy&#34; to marry, the low-simmer friction between the character and her widowed mother, her lurch toward becoming sexual (though instead of it being an empowering experience, it seems bloodily punishing).<br /><br />A Women's Studies student could have a heyday with this book, and there is some sharp class criticism to be found, too, and even some racism (the n-word makes an appearance). The book is like a time capsule from that era, but still holds up as relevant all these years later.<br /><br />A strange coincidence: I noted from the old library card in the back of the book that I was the last one to borrow it from the library, and I did so on this very day nineteen years ago. This time of year - late winter, and the time of year Plath died - seems to be the right time to read her work.
B00A4FOWYQ|5.0|Heartthrob has no weaknesses, but some of my favorites are &#34;I Was A Fool&#34;, I'm All Messed Up, and &#34;I Can't Be Your Friend&#34;. Tegan and Sara are a great live band too!
B0000259KL|5.0|It's all good! Nice music ... All the way thru!  Another great CD from Steely Dan that is timeless and after listening to this one; will leave you with a Smile on ur face!  :-)
0061353248|5.0|I recommend the book to everyone, im an international business student and i am really in love with it. consumers behavior are explained with lot of examples and you can understand how companies use marketing techniques nowadays to get into consumers mind.
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I used others before finding Feedly, I became addicted the first time i used it. Great app i use it every day.
0525478817|2.0|While admittedly, this is a sweet story, it is completely inappropriate for children less than high school age.  This was given as a gift to my 3rd grader with the comment that it was the top-rated book for pre-teens of 9-12 years old.  I  casually flipped through the book, as I generally preview books my younger children read, not only to discern if the material is appropriate and the book well-written, but to prepare myself for potential discussion with my child.  In the first four random flips I found words like &#34;ba****d&#34;, and page implying sexual activity.  I recommend anyone considering this book for a child, read it first to determine if it is something the child is mature enough for.  It is definitely not for the age bracket recommended to me, and I did not allow my 9 year old to read it.  This story could have been told with equal honesty and sensitivity but without the irreverence and bad language.
B005K17RU0|3.0|Would like to be able to view weather forecasts out further, at least 10 days. The page could be simplified, too. It seems a bit busy.
B00BESLHEA|2.0|I expected more from this film seeing as how there were several we'll known actors in it. However it turned out to be a big disappointment.
B009GX7IRA|5.0|In its tenth season NCIS just keeps getting better.  Love this show!  Hope there are ten more and that the cast never leaves!
B00AREIAI8|4.0|this is a fun and interactive game with great visuals. its very interesting. I enjoy the expirence it brings. I reccomend that you purchase this app because it is a good substitute for people who cant have an actual horse. I hope that they will make another visual interactive with different animals. its very realistic.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|This is not his best novel, but it is very good.<br />When I read Grisham, I can't stop until I finish.
B00B4VI8MQ|5.0|But then again sometimes short is good if you don't want to commit too much time to a game. If you're low on time to waste, this is just about right. Lots of HOs to find. Not too hard so as to frustrate. All in all, worthy of 5 stars. Bring on the next one!
B005J3IEZQ|5.0|I loved this book by Walter Isaacson.<br /><br />I don't even own an Apple product but I did so admire Steve Jobs and what he did to make Apple the biggest selling product on the planet!!<br /><br />The book is an honest look in to the life of Steve Jobs from the very beginning right up until his death.<br /><br />One of the best biographies I've ever read. He will be missed by so many of his loyal supporters.
B008JGSM6G|3.0|it just isn't easy and not as much fun  takes to long to get to next level and is frustrateing
B007HACDLK|5.0|Always on target.  One of the best in this addictive series of powerful adventures.  Looking forward to  the next gem.
B000BW7QWW|5.0|If you liked firefly you will like the movie. Still am hoping to see another movie or the show start up again.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|After hearing other people's reviews of this book I thought it was best to read it myself and then judge.<br /><br />Really not sure how to take Christian in the beginning but by the end of the first book he really is a great character. He is a multi-millionaire, sure, but that's not what makes him such a lovable character.<br /><br />He knows what he wants - and usually gets it!!  Ana is such a wonderful character and she is just the person to 'tame' Christian. Once you learn 'why' he is the way he is - because he was seduced to begin with - you feel so sorry for him - I just wanted to give him a huge hug and tell him &#34;everything would be alright&#34;.<br /><br />Had to read all 3 Books in the Fifty Shades series. Highly recommended!!
B001PP9ALY|4.0|an excellent ending, good action, story line and execution, keeps your interest,Angelina is not to bad to look at either.
1616550414|5.0|Got here on time and its just beautiful its eye candy all the way through for any zelda fan! i recommend it to every fan of the series
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's better than the first and It has more obstacles and its a new adventure for you to discover and play with friends.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|about every other week my kindle can not connect to their servers. makes it very frustrating because I enjoy playing.  wish they would get it fixed.
B006DJ2JSI|2.0|I was disappointed that it did not work on my Kindle app on my second reader.  I need help if it is supposed to work on my app.
B004J4WKTW|5.0|This was the most beautiful book I have ever read!  The writer takes you into the circus where you feel so much a part of it that it might just break your heart!  One of the first books in all my years of reading that I want to read again very soon!  An amazing labyrinth of description, magic, and timeless passion.
B003SI7OQ4|5.0|my son loves this movie and has seen it several times.  He likes all the characters and enjoys the music.
B008BM9L72|4.0|I saw Fifty Shades of Grey advertised at an exhibition/showcase that I attended recently and then in a cartoon so I downloaded the sample book which seemed interesting, so I purchased the Trilogy when I realised that it was just the first part. I must say that it was not what I expected and was tempted to remove it from my Kindle but despite the BDSM information and explicit sexual activities I thought the book was very interesting and well written. For most of my life I read mostly Mysteries, since I love unraveling puzzles.<br /><br />While reading these books, it occurred to me that, although this is fiction, I have lived a sheltered life for almost 60 years despite  having two children.  I was shocked at many of the activities explained in detail but am not one to dictate to others how to live their lives. I have read the complete set and must commend the author for an enjoyable and enlightening piece of literature which shows the amount of research that went into completing this Trilogy.  Although there were some missing words there was not the blatant grammatical errors seen in many of the other books that I have read.
B0025KVLTM|5.0|For those of us baby-boomers this is a seminal work that was the beginning of the end.  The messages within it are still apt today...a true classic and a change-up in style for the &#34;mop heads&#34;.
B0084AZXKK|5.0|Changed the way English speakers think of pirates even to this day. And despite being a &#34;classic&#34;, it's wonderfully readable.
B007DIQC90|4.0|This band seems to be part of the whole 60s folk revival albeit with new twists. The music is very catchy, nostalgic sounding, and the lyrics are well crafted.
B00APUQT7I|5.0|If you loved the first three Ice Age movies you will not be disappointed in Continental drift either. The Ice Age movies are entertaining for everyone in our family from Grandma & Grandpa to our six year old.
B0025KVLUQ|5.0|The Beatles, the Abbey Road album...who could for get this piece of work?  Sound quality was great and i spent a most enjoyable time listening to an oldie and a goodie!
B00BHU9BV6|1.0|I could not get through the first 10 minutes of this movie!!  The set is awful!  Playing out like it was all on a stage-who thought of this?  This movie had the potential to be a classic, instead it is a joke.....<br />Very disappointed!  I want my money back....
B0087GJ8KM|4.0|De lectura dinámica y entretenida. Si bien hay mucho escrito sobre el tema, Daniel lo hace de una forma muy gráfica y con el buen uso de ejemplos, lo hace de fácil comprensión.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Easy reading.  Makes me miss my beloved LuLu more and more.  I realize why God created animals - they love us without exception and expect so little in return.  They are better judges of people than humans.  We should take lessons from our pets.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|I give this book 5 stars.....Sparks does it again (such a great read).....Now I can't wait to watch the movie!!!!
B008MG1E4A|5.0|Great book....I had a hard time putting it down. God Bless our military and the intelligence community that helped take out UBL.
B0087GJ8KM|5.0|I have read To Sell Is Human cover to cover twice. I have spent some time reading many of the Amazon reviews of the book. I can see where some reviewers may not get Dan's message... though I would argue that it is not a function of the writing.<br /><br />Dan Pink cuts through the jargon and explains the underlying social science and behaviors that lead to effective sales. He presents complicated topics using simple, human language that anyone can understand. In fact, the true meaning of the book is to realize the role each person plays in \\"selling\\" ideas on a daily basis. The heroes in most areas of life (business, social, community service) are those who can masterfully get others to follow them into battle. To Sell is Human does not provide a litany of questionable tactics. It does however provide the research and guidance to self-assess your strengths and limitations that can make you effective at selling (no matter how you define it).<br /><br />I wrote a book that addresses how companies can engage their entire teams to grow revenue. I succinctly discuss the specific steps one can take.  What was missing in my book was the science behind my assertions. In To Sell Is Human, Dan cites research, studies, and interviews that help the reader discover not just WHAT to do, but WHY it is effective. Dan realizes that effective sales is about integrity, and serving others - and he helps us realize that this is not part of the stereotypical salesperson's profile.<br /><br />Especially those who sell professional services should find the book very valuable. Have you ever noticed that the most effective salespeople are the ones who you feel best understand you and your situation?  There is a ton of research that supports this notion. Dan Pink confirms the concept, and then gives you tangible ways to hone your skills. His section on Attunement (part of the new ABC's of selling) provides some great exercises to see where you can improve your own skills.<br /><br />[[ASIN:0985733306 Upside Down Selling: An Integrity-based Sales Approach to Avoid Being Predictable]]<br /><br />I tend to be hypercritical of books on sales - having written one. I usually pick them a part like a jerk. I first read To Sell Is Human in Kindle format. I have screen after screen of notes and ideas that I have incorporated into my workshops, programs, keynote addresses, and my life. Unlike other business books that try to hide the fact that a certain study might not represent every situation in the world, Dan is quite candid about the depth of each study and the conclusions you can (or cannot)infer based on their potential bias.<br /><br />I've had the pleasure of sharing the stage with Dan Pink as well as some of the brightest minds in the sales world like SPIN Selling's Neil Rackham, and Customer Centered Selling's Rob Jolles. For a guy who has not spent his career in \\"sales,\\" Daniel Pink may have shifted my thinking the most of any of them. Not only does he offer great content, but he has a written and spoken style that is genuine. He remains approachable, personable, and happens to be one of the funniest and brightest people I have met - it might just catch you off guard.<br /><br />If you want to improve your ability to sell services, products, or ideas in general, To Sell Is Human would be a good place to start.
B007SGM084|5.0|This trilogy was absolutely amazing!!! I really enjoyed how the series unfold. I give E L James two thumbs up and a silk tie!
B000067QMD|5.0|Cheapest place to buy them is on Amazon. You get a package of 6 for this price. They work great to seal bottles, and it's always nice to have extras of these, especially if you're going to freeze/store your milk.
B000HSKUBE|4.0|Great Story line -- keeps one in suspense, Bitter ending not to my taste.. but I guess that's what some people enjoy. Kill off the heroine.
B004HD61KE|5.0|So only meaning to preview this book from my kindle, I accidentally purchased it. Great accident. Though this is a much later book in the series, this is my first sigma force read. Very well put together, and while I most assuredly cannot attest to accuracy, the intrigue and suspense throughout the novel is excellent. I will most definitely be reading the remaining sigma force novels. I believe I may have found an addition to my short list of authors to remember.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Dragon Story has all the makings of a great epic game w.o the need for a pc, very addictive and socially outstanding.  2 Thumbs Up!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I would recommend this to middle schoolers through adults.  It is a nice story from a fresh perspective.  We learn a lot about ourselves, i think, through the eyes of each character but especially August.
B0000524E5|5.0|Replaced old vhs tape with this dvd, plays well and seems to be of good quality.Would recommend this product to others.
B002XTBE6K|4.0|The filled out story was excellent compared to movies. It explains a lot more about the background of Mr Churchill which is necessary and also is good.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|Great atmosphere. Good sound effects. Fun mystery and excellent cast. Here's to hoping Hawke spends a bit more time doing horror flicks.
0345505387|5.0|this was a pleasant surprise for me !  i bought it expecting the usual novel and found it to be an exciting graphic novel. almost a cartoon story !  i thought it was marvelous !
B009CCBCU4|2.0|Just didn’t hold my interest and I only read the first 100 pages before I sent it to the carousel.
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|The first judge dredd sucked compared to this one.  This one was super cool.  They didn't waste too much time developing characters, but enough to get the jist.  Good movie.
B004QZ9PLU|5.0|I love Nicholas Sparks's book. This book is one of his best stories. I couldn't put it down and read it straight through and was sad to finish it.
B003JTHXOK|4.0|Even through the plot is fairly predictable, &#34;Jo&#34; makes the read worthwhile. Struggles of the heart are never predictable, yet often familiar.
B00A1XOPE8|4.0|A good short story, with yet again a new, interesting &#34;power&#34; for the hero. The trademark of Sanderson is to describe the magic system in his stories in such details that the reader knows what to expect, no Deus Ex Machina! However, since the novel is short, there is much setup, but very few action. Still, quite interesting. I would recommend it to any Sanderson fan, or fantasy-lover in general.
B00BESLHEA|5.0|I like Tarentino's stuff.  This definitely did not have as much blood and guts as his usual movies.  No titties and stuff, so if your wife is anti-titties... than she should be cool with this movie.
B002X4OKRK|2.0|Kids wanted to watch and I usually like Johnny Depp. He was too creepy and there wasn't enough of a difference between the old and new movie. Stick with Gene Wilder as Willy Wonka.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I'm not satisfied with the ending, to say the least; but the trip there was fun. Nicely crafted. GONE GIRL is a surprisingly entertaining look inside the mind of a sociopath - one that makes me think of people we all could know and probably do. The narrative twists happened faster and more frequently than I'd expected; I found myself being led along one path with a clear look at the presumed sunny destination ahead of me, but there was always a detour that guided me away and back to hell. Recommended.
0979019710|5.0|The Miracle Morning works. I have been following this program on and off for the last 4 years. It works. Since following Hal Elrod's principles, I have more than tripled my income, found the girl of my dreams and have never been happier. This book is great for anyone who wants a simple way to improve there life. I highly recommend it
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I almost wish there was a real zombie apocalypse, so I could go shoot zombies.  Looks like fun.  Good series.  Love it.  The rotating cast kinda sucks though.  They keep killing the originals, and bringing more in. . . they should bring people in first, develop their character a little bit... and kill off those guys.  Just saying.
B00ABGEFWC|5.0|This is a really cute game, my daughter loves it. I thought it was so great that I started playing it myself. You get to feed,  play with and groom your pets to earn points and more pets. I think most if not all little girls will like this game, maybe some adults too.
034580404X|5.0|Very happy with these books. Was very glad to find it alot cheaper on here then what they want for them in the stores!!
B0083P1QUM|1.0|It drags on and on.  It really puts you to sleep.  She stays on one subject and goes into such minute detail, I just wanted her to move on to another aspect.  Not a very good plot.  Not a novel that keeps you on the edge of your seat.  Seems like she wanted to fill pages with words so she describes the scenery, the type of material something is made out of, every turn of her travel from one location to another (like every turn in the road) which had nothing to do with the plot of the book.  Not a book I would recommend for someone who likes a page turner that keeps your attention and makes you not want to put the good down.  Also the relationship between the protagonist and her husband is really confusing. The ending was so ridiculous I now can't believe I read the entire book. All in all, the book puts you to sleep, so if you like reading before turning out the lights, this book might interest you.  Maybe not.
B0087HT36U|1.0|Won't run on a Galaxy Nexus. I appreciate that it runs on my Kindle, but come on and fix some of these issues.
B009IQ0TGM|5.0|She has a voice that is truly original. I loved her music from the first time i heard Lights. This album is very different from her original . it is deeper but more subdued. I had to listen to it a few times to appreciate the album. Now its one of my favorites and doesn't leave my playlist.
1579128149|5.0|My 2nd grader loves this book, and that makes me very happy.  This is a book for anyone to enjoy.  The pictures are great and the explanation are fun to read.
B002PEP4SC|5.0|This was a really good read. I thoroughly enjoyed getting to know Nikki Heat, Jameson Rook, Lauren Parry, and Detectives Ochoa and Raley.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|I've never seen The Walking Dead graphic novels, so I can't compare this to the source material.  But I've been watching television for over 50 years, and I can say without qualification that this is the best television show ever made.  Better than &#34;Lost,&#34; better than &#34;The X-Files&#34; at it's peak (seasons 3 through 5), better than any workplace drama, sitcom, police procedural, or science fiction / fantasy show ever made.  No other show has had this level of intensity, extreme violence, raw emotion, intense personal conflicts, profoundly disturbing character developments, and ever-present danger.  It seems like every few episodes, another principal character is killed. When the violence starts, these familiar people are in more danger than in any other television series you've ever seen.<br /><br />But this story line isn't about zombies; it isn't even about an apocalypse.  It's about humanity and morality slipping away from desperate people who never have time to grieve those they've lost.  It's the most horrific war story ever told.  At least when we watched &#34;Combat&#34; or &#34;Tour of Duty,&#34; we knew that eventually the conflict would end.  We watch these people struggle for survival, knowing it can't possibly end well.  This is Hell, without the possibility of redemption.<br /><br />Of course, it helps that the producers have assembled an incredible cast, and the most capable crew in the industry.  These are 42 minute feature films, in terms of quality.  But the material is what truly makes this exceptional.  Kudos to AMC for having the courage to green light the most graphic television series ever made, and letting it be about the story.
B005BZQVJ8|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised with this fast-paced and extremely hilarious romp that defies being categorized exclusively as a science fiction or comedy movie. There are subtle messages written into the dialogue and story line of this film; subtle commentaries on a number of present-day (immigration? sexual preferences? religion? government subterfuge and cover-up?) social issues are masterfully interwoven in the dialogue. But aside from all that .... it is just a funny, laugh-a-minute movie that can be viewed simply for being an entertaining film. The dialogue is definitely geared to adults so I would not recommend it for younger viewing audiences. Watch it for yourself. I originally caught the &#34;tail-end&#34; of this movie as I was scanning some premium cable channels late one night; and decided to buy it based on that one glimpse! I was not disappointed when I finally viewed the film from beginning to end. An added bit of information, my 86-year old Dad watched it while visiting with us a few months ago and almost split his sides laughing. He had me order a copy for him at Amazon that very night!!!!! Enjoy!!!!
B00BESFWBY|5.0|Really good Movie and it was a true Story as well.<br />The scenery of the this movie was good too.
0307895475|5.0|This a grea guide book.  It's not a book full of cheats or offers answers on how to get past certain boss battles.  If you get stuck, use the internet.  Where this book really shines is in its ability to keep you on track or explain maybe some of the quests where your quest log is not really clear.  In my case, I had a situation where I was sent on a quest to kill someone for the Dark Brotherhood.  I told my companion to wait outside while I did the deed.  However, I got distracted and left and went onto another quest.  The problem is that once I noticed my companion was missing, I couldn't remember which town the contract had been in (it was night and I had fast travelled there so little to go on).  I was able to look up the quest, and then go back to that town and find the waiting companion.  The only area that I could say the book is lacking in is organization.  Quests are not listed by name in the index in most cases, but are all in the table of contents.  The problem is that there are so many, it can be difficult to find them.  Also, the book is split between quests and game info and the atlas of locations.  You have to go back and forth sometimes to follow a dungeon map compared to info on a quest if needed.  However, overall, this is the best guide I have ever used for a game.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|It doesn't require much thought. The answers are always right there. The game directs you all the way. Was disappointed.
B00B5HQKNI|2.0|This Bond movie got very good reviews from critics and audiences on various sites so I was expecting something really exceptional. Unfortunately, it was predictable, and borrowed heavily from other movies for it's plot and some of the action sequences.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|This was a great book. As always Nicholas Sparks never let's us down.  I can't wait to go see the movie now.
B005LAIHSQ|3.0|I desperately wanted to enjoy this movie.  The cinematography was excellent.  The costuming and scenery were fantastic.  The FX were extremely well done.  Charlize Theron was excellent in portraying the evil queen.  Chris Hemsworth, on the other hand, was doing a second rate copy of Val Kilmer's role in Willow.  The dwarfs stole the show.<br /><br />The problem is that the screenplay was just plain awful.  It allowed little or know character development, was formulaic and predictable.  It also appears to have drawn so much from Willow that at one point, I remarked, \\"Where is Fin Rizel\\".<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the film's direction.  On one hand, the scenes were well set up, but I can't determine if the way the actors presented their lines was the fault of the director, or the script, itself.<br /><br />FWIW, the quality of the video and audio on the blu ray version, is excellent.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Denzel is really one of the best actors I have ever seen . I am always blown away by his acting skills he is so believable in any role he takes on.
B00BHMEALA|5.0|Suspenseful drama. Good acting. Good plot. Enjoyed it. Ben Afleck, Brian Cranstan, John Goodman. . . they all did an excellent job.
B0063GORYU|5.0|love the game. have played it for years. favorite.easy to play and makes you think about your next move. l play solitaire too.
0345803493|3.0|Books 1 and 2 are the best out of the 3... They are only so-so but I wanted to read it and Amazon had the best price
B0027MJU00|4.0|Preferred Sharp Objects, but this was great too.  Can't wait to read Gone Girl!  Libby was appealing for all of her faults, much like Camille in Sharp Objects.
B00B2QA646|2.0|I just could not get into this movie for some reason. The book is much better. Save your money, read the book.
B0054VVRBQ|5.0|It works.<br />Read/write speed is so fast that the limit is your card not this reader.<br />And most importantly, it fits perfectly into my t420s.<br />It even looks like an OEM part.<br />I recommend this to every Thinkpad owners.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|The Pact kept my interest peeked the whole book.  I could not put it away toward the end. Jodi Picoult researches her subjects thoroughly and that makes for a good read!
B009EEFTMC|5.0|I really enjoy this game!  I like majong and other match games so this one was a nice addition to my kindle.  I love the colors and the 3D movements of the cube.  /this is a really good time passer too.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Beautifully sung and written movie theme  by the one and only. Hope this one becomes a  #1  hit for her.
0375842209|5.0|Incredible book!  I could not put it down.  It was so uniquely written with so much detail.  One of the best books I have read in a long time.  Awesome book club selection because a tonne of conversation generated from this book.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This movie seemed real, not overly sentimental or sweet.  I thought it was fascinatingly simple, but complex as life actually is.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Good it's cool to get discounted stuff and it's even cooler to get free stuff. yeah me. For the free prime
B00AIQP9DE|4.0|Great game to have to kill time.  The challenges aren't overly hard to complete and you can always skip them if you cant figure it out.  I would have been glad to pay the fee.  It wasn't necessary to say it was free when it wasn't.
1616550414|5.0|REALLY GREAT, Perfect print, good material and I thought I knew everything about the zelda series, but they managed to teach me a few thing !!<br /><br />overall :  a must have !
B007ZGBZHE|1.0|The authors this time have failed to give a book up to the Pendergast standards. They wrecked the agent's usual stalwart personality and made him a wimp from the beginning. The ridiculous, outrageously bazaar activities they give during P's pursuit of his poor son are so over the top that they lend nothing to the story. The incipient malefactors that Pendergast usually runs into are missing. Instead the authors have decided to create such an absurd backstory along with preposterous machinations to go along with it that the entire story of P's wife's demise goes sour. They crushed Pendergast's usual demeanor and made him a miserable wretch. The only saving grace were the other characters' stories - which could have well been other books expanded to include Pendergast. I am sorry I paid good money to buy this one. Disappointment doesn't begin to explain my feelings. After waiting for almost a year and a half for this last of the last trilogy, it could have been much longer - like 900+ pages. This latest Pendergast offering was a very BIG disappointment.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|[[ASIN:B003UBTX6S Beautiful Darkness (Beautiful Creatures)]] is an awesome sequel in my opinion even better than Beautiful Creatures. I am now so hooked on this series.  Beautiful Darkness is very detailed, and the characters are both charming and  complicated. You have the same characters from book 1 along with some new ones to mix it up a bit.  Being from the South I absolutely love the Southern backdrop, lore and culture that is shared.  You start out back in South Carolina and end up in Savannah Georgia one of my favorite places.<br /><br />Definitely recommend that you read the first book first, or you'll be a little lost.  The beginning does recap a bit but it just would not be the same.<br /><br />My favorite quote is from Ethan, \\" Who am I to take on a battle between powers I didn't understand-armed with a runaway cat, a uniquely bad drummer, a pair of garden shears, and an Ovaltine -drinking teen Galileo?\\" Yet, he never runs away Ethan faces everything that is happening to both him and Lena.<br /><br />Loved this book and am so happy there is a big juicy book behind it to keep me entertained.  Looking forward to Beautiful Chaos!
B007SGM084|4.0|Got my online books, all three, uploaded to my Galaxy tab.  love the books so far, great.  Still reading on the books.  Thank you
B003O86FMW|5.0|Amazing. Book one was great and this book is as good or better. I can't wait to start book three
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|I pre-ordered season 3 and was very pleased with this purchase since I just couldn't wait to see on TV.  I love English programs and this is my favorite.
B003UBTX6S|5.0|This whole series is excellent!  I loved diving deeper into the Caster World.  Lena, Ethan, and the gang continue to have crazy adventures.
1451695195|5.0|Fascinating book by a doctor and his near death experience and his road to recovery.  I have seen Dr. Alexander in a video<br />taped interview, which makes the book more interesting for me.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|So I really loved this movie because it showed the vulnerability  and the strength of Bond and Q both! Losing Q was shocking and sad,but not entirely surprising,since it was time she retired to other projects ( movies) in the future. I was pleased with the pace the movie maintained throughout,since it was a bit longer than the previous Bond movies. The villain was both comical and horrifying and pathetic, yet brilliant and twisted at the same time. Clearly he had a mommy fixation on Q and it was especially evident at the end. They made a refreshing change and did not rely on equipment gimmicks this time and kept it simple and basic for  Bond. I would have done the scene over where Bonds current love interest was killed and had Bond rescue her,instead of letting the Villain kill her and then suddenly Bond springs into action. He could have just as easily have done it then and saved her life! It was interesting getting a hint of what Bonds life was like in childhood. Albert Finney made an excellent caretaker and friend of Bonds. All the other elements such as cinematography and music were spot on and made for a very enjoyable movie which I would recommend to anyone and as well as buying a copy if your an avid Bond fan like me!
B004GYY714|5.0|Great App. I enjoy a few local talk radio shows on AM that are difficult to get clear reception and/or their web sites have streaming option that lose (or no) connectivity often. TuneIn lets me listen to these shows on my Kindle and Android phone with clear audio resolution. I am looking forward to expand to listen to music channels. Highly recommend this App.
B00571F26Y|4.0|The book has some interesting thoughts about wheat.  Parts of it I had to skip over because it reads like a medical textbook.  Too much information that is not needed to understand the overall concepts.  In practice, I would find following a wheat free diet to be very, very difficult.  Just about everything you eat has wheat or gluten in it.  So you are left with fruits, vegetables and proteins.  Even the store brought proteins can contain wheat or gluten.  I understand the philosophy, I just think a wheat free diet would be difficult to follow.
1401937519|5.0|I'm extremely interested in true stories of near death experiences.  I plan on attending her lecture in Tucson March 21st
B005QUQ99K|5.0|We have the ultimate Lego collection going on.  I should have taken stock out on Legos a long time ago.
1594744769|3.0|I felt more connected to the photos in the book rather than the writing.<br />To me, It seemed like something was missing in the story.  May the ending left too much imagination to the the readers or the leading boy wasn't a stronger character as I hope it would be.<br />But, it was a fun read.
B009G7ZYPY|5.0|We love this CD of Susan Boyle's. Every song is wonderful and we especially enjoyed the duets with Donny Osmond. Will listen to this over & over again.
1250004217|2.0|I have heard a lot about Sarah's Key, mainly concerning storytelling and how vividly de Rosnay writes and creates her characters. And since I love most things French, including history, I've always wanted to read this novel. According to her bio on the MacMillan website, de Rosnay's writing has been grouped together with the likes of Stephenie Meyers and Dan Brown. If you know anything about those two authors' styles then you know that they aren't at the top of the heap when it comes to quality. Let's just say de Rosnay is in good company with these two.<br /><br />Let's start with characters. The novel is written with alternating chapters written in Sarah's POV and Julia's POV. De Rosnay uses a very gimmicky device of not revealing Sarah's name until what she must have thought was just the right moment, but since the book is called Sarah's Key and the only other main character is Julia, then it doesn't take a genius to figure out who Sarah is in the novel. This gimmick is used later when it comes to the name of Julia's baby. I bet you can't guess what she names the little girl? Julia is one of those nails-on-a-chalkboard characters that you just want to smack across the face and tell them to wake the hell up. She stays in a horrible relationship all because the sex is great. What? and Why? Her husband, Bertrand, is a very cliché French character -- snarky, sneering all the time, insincere, and whiny. He's cheated on Julia in the past and I wouldn't have been surprised if he was still cheating on her throughout the majority of the book, but that subject never fully surfaces. Julia puts up with his crap, even to the point that she's willing to get an abortion to make him happy in order to enjoy their golden years together. There's a point when they finally split ways, but instead of calling him out and telling him just exactly how she feels about all those years of Bertrand belittling her in front of everyone, Julia simply feels sorry for him and sends him on his way. The relationship just isn't realistic. One other thing I picked up on Julia's character is the fact that she's supposed to be American. Very American. I'm sorry, but de Rosnay does not do a good job of painting an American woman. Julia's mannerisms, her speech, even the way she deals with certain situations feel very European. Julia just isn't a believable American character.<br /><br />The uniqueness of the story is what drew me in. I've never heard about the Vel' d'Hiv' and quite frankly de Rosnay makes sure the reader isn't going to walk away not knowing all there is to know about this little-known roundup. It's almost too much. With little else holding the storyline together, the reader is constantly in Julia's brooding mind, rehashing events over and over again. Sarah's story is engaging to a certain extent. Again, there's that feeling that de Rosnay doesn't really know how to write from a ten-year-old's POV. Many of Sarah's thoughts seem very adult in nature. Sarah's somewhat interesting storyline comes to an abrupt halt a little over halfway through the book. It is now up to Julia to figure everything out. And by that point in the story, I didn't want to be in Julia's head for the remainder of the novel. Julia sets out on a mission to track down Sarah and her family, apologize for any wrongdoing her husband's family may have committed (which there isn't any) and apologize for not knowing this part of history. There really isn't any need for Julia to apologize for not having studied the Vel'd'Hiv' in her high school history class, but I guess that's beside the point. I think de Rosnay just needed a reason to extend the novel to a necessary publishing length, because the ending gets really long and drawn out. Personally, I think the book should have ended around page 268 after the revelation of Sarah's true past to William, her son.<br /><br />As much as it pains me, because I love French history, I am not going to recommend this book. It's a little like a wolf in sheep's clothing. De Rosnay is adamant in saying Sarah's Key is not a historical novel, but the sad part in all of this is that it would have been much more enjoyable if it were. Too much of this book feels like a rough draft that was never properly read or edited. It's a dash of history with some fluffy storyline coating it in a sticky film. If you're looking for a good Holocaust novel, then I'd say look elsewhere.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This book inspired me by be the kind of kid who comes up to a friend and cares about others and to be brave enough to stand up to someone and be a friend!<br />Mierya
B009NQKPUW|5.0|Pretty good movie.
B00BESLHEA|3.0|Plot was predictable but I loved the fight scenes. They are what you would expect from Quentin Tarantino. Russel Crowe character was like nothing you've seen him do before.
B001MM28JG|5.0|Awesome job here on the spoof - very funny and very entertaining.  Actors do a great job in the roles they're given, especially Tim Allen doing his best William Shatner...<br /><br />Rent this one- you won't be disappointed!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|it's a bond movie.  it's fine.  it's okay.  it is what it is.  daniel craig is fine and all is tolerable.
B001BN1ZHW|5.0|Stunning Blue-Ray of a classic Sondheim musical.  Johnny Depp is one of his generation's kinkiest, deepest actors--and he can sing.  Helena Bonham-Carter is only slightly less stellar. The production's dark color values of gray, black and red are a wonderful complement to the dark-and-bloody story.

B006AZZPCM|1.0|Uninstalled until then.... find a better alternative.  Some of the ads are not kid safe, and others are almost kid-centered.  It's an odd mix - but not one worth keeping.
B008O9V4C2|2.0|Don't think Steely Dan put out a bad song, but Fagen alone... yes.  Only good song on this is:  &#34;I'm not the same w/o u&#34;<br />Probably put this one away f/ good...

B006LSZECO|4.0|I enjoyed this book as a good evening read after a busy day.  There were enough twists and turns to hold my interest, and, although I thought I had figured it out, was pleased to find yet another layer.  Not a thriller, more a thoughtful mystery gradually unfolding.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I really like this game it is really fun to play an ad so realistic as well I would recommend it to lots of people
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|I enjoyed watching the &#34;Doctor Who Season 1 Videos&#34; they were well performed, and kept my interest. I look forward to the future season episodes. I'm also interested in watching the relationship between Rose and the doctor develop as well as Mickeys role does he continue to be a secondary character or become more involved in the show. Its interesting to watch them visit different centuries and civilizations while getting in and out of trouble.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A very good book, hard to put down. It was also disturbing providing a diabolical look into a very disturbed mind.
B00AREIAI8|4.0|its fun to play but it is hard to get more than one horse. overall I really like the game!
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love this game because of the format and addictiveness of it. I play this game everyday because I always try to get higher and higher scores.

B006Z949XY|5.0|I loved the music in this movie. Way better than the 1st Happy Feet.  NOTICE HOW A HUGE MAJORITY OF THE 1 STAR REVIEWS WERE WRITTEN ON THE SAME DAY,  FEBRUARY 2, 2012.  Some individual is up to no good!!
B008JGSM6G|2.0|I won't use this much. It is really a boring game to me. Maybe it was meant to be for children. Really too simple for adults.

B0034G4OYA|5.0|Went to see this movie at the theatres with my family we kept saying afterward how much we enjoyed it.  Normally I wont see this type movie but am glad I did.  Adam Sandler and the rest of the cast did a great job with voice-overs and the funny scenes.  Highly recommend this movie for a family night.
1846551455|5.0|nesbo is a fantastic writer. even the first was great. i would read anything he writes and only wish he would write more and have them translated earlier.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I absolutely love this book! Great detail. Easy to read, and comprehend. Thank you Suzanne Collins for a wonderful read!!
B00B2V66VS|3.0|I downloaded this on my kindle fire and it would always crash. I'm not sure of the reason but it was annoying me! now I have to keep deleting it and downloading it again and again. but other than that, the game is extremely fun to play and its fun and addictive.
0743243153|5.0|My daughters therapist recommended this book. She refused to read it, but I think if she had, she would have found it very helpful in her depression. I certainly enjoyed it!

B003O86FMW|5.0|There is no way you can read book one and not read book two. I flew through it. Couldn't wait to see what would happen. You won't be disappointed with how the story continues.
0061122416|5.0|really love it . great story makes you think about journey you take in your life to get to some point and may be it is not the end of it or just a beginning of it.......recommend it to everybody.
B007SGM084|5.0|At parts of t he book I found it hard to put down. Found myself looking for more at the end.
B005LW5J9O|5.0|A very insteresting way of delving into another era, mind set and paradigm. Can't put it down. Mr. Greenblatt draws the substance which helped to produce the bones that sustain the 'body' of your current 'civilization'.
B00AA8Q0FQ|5.0|Item was exactly as described and if you are a Monster High Fan I recommend this movie for you!  A+
B009EEFTMC|5.0|this rotating matching game is enjoyable in arcade mode and pretty challenging in the puzzle mode. controls are good and play is smooth on nexus 10.
B00136Q6DA|5.0|A catchy pop sound that you can't help but listen to all day. In my opinion, her best album. Definitely worth the money.
B0026ISUUQ|4.0|this is a good movie, but I liked the book way better, Ralph Fiennes is the perfect Justin Quayle! I would recommend reading the book as well as watching the movie
B00AREIAI8|5.0|It is a fun game to play, the different horses are cool but I wish the unicorns weren't so expencive
B009D0LBRO|5.0|1) I didn't believe this could be a good app, but I read a review, and bought it.<br />2) it has a ridiculously big feeling to it, and the controls are flawless for mobile devices.  it feels more like rayman origins than anything else.<br />3) if you like rayman origins, buy this app.  it is really remarkable and my favorite android game.
0547396945|5.0|This is a wonderful book for children and having the extra Spanish is a terrific bonus. I have purchased many copies for children and they delight in the story and the interaction with the words. It is a fun read for grownups too! The board book version is very helpful for little fingers that haven't learned to turn paper pages carefully. A great buy at Amazon!
B006P0FICE|5.0|This was an interesting cast to watch.  I liked getting to see Orlando Bloom play a bad guys he does it pretty well IMO
B007PMDI96|5.0|I love this book. Maybe meant to be for young adults this is not a dumbed down book. I tried reading Sabriel, the book before this in the series, and couldn't get into it. Lirael, however, hooked me. The crazy library & Disreputable Dog companion definitely helped, but the book is generally well written and engaging (cliche, but I couldn't put it down.) I highly recommend it. One of my favorite books EVER.
B00B0NDF26|5.0|This album is extremely catchy and upbeat.  If you prefer complicated and layered music, and don't like pop... at all - then you may not like this album.  If you like well written pop, bordering on the preciousness of Mates of State on one side and the electronic sound of Robyn on the other, you should check this out.  Solid music, all around.
B003O86FMW|4.0|Definitely going to get book three right now! I did not expect that to happen. can't wait to see what happens to peeta.
B008CP6RWU|5.0|This is a fun and entertaining.  I never know that a game with no spoken sounds could be so fun.  It is kind of a real world Puzzle game but with a mix of platforming mixed in.<br />One of the best games I have played in a while.  Also as a bonus the game comes with the game Flow.  Which is an interesting game kind of like the early stages of Spore.  It is mindless Entertainment.  Nothing to stressful and just a nice way to past some free time.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|I'm a big fan of this series, this book is very good it left me wanting more. This isn't the usual fairy tale book, people die on this story like flies being swatted. Can't wait for the next book
B0094OLFUW|3.0|This album is a slow burn.  A really slow burn.  The soundscape is nice, but this isn't upbeat at all.  If you need an album to relax to with a scotch at the end of the night, or an album to sleep to, this is a great fit.  After 10 or so listens, it doesn't unfold in any additional layers.  It simply is.  It exists.  It has moments of beauty, but moments of dullness.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Harder than the first temple run but fun and worth the price!!! My favorite part is when you ride in the cave!! ;) this app deserves 5 star ratings!!!
B0047Y0FGY|5.0|Tina Fey is great. I have so much more respect for her after reading her book. I constantly found myself cracking up in public while reading it. I would definitely recommend it to others and have.
B0081BU42O|4.0|The Hydrogen Sonata is a fine addition to the Culture series.  I'd say it's better than Consider Phlebas, but perhaps not as good as Surface Detail.  It's far better than most of what has been published in the past year or so.  The plot is not without gaps, and there are questions I'll ask the author if we ever meet, but on the whole I very much enjoyed the story.
B0053TMP24|5.0|This is a book I recommend to mythology lovers. It is the perfect book if you liked Percy Jackson and the olympians
B008N9AAQ4|5.0|The best film yet from the folks who brought you Baraka.  As good as video can get on bluray.  Reference quality visuals.  Very captivating.
B00116GHMM|5.0|This album was definitely a long awaited add ton to the modern music scene, with wonderful guitar/effects and psychedelic synth , you cant go wrong.
B009IEXKXI|5.0|This was one of the best dollars I've spent in quite a while.  The story is gripping, the characters are well developed, the pacing is tight, and the occasional humor well executed.  I'm surprised the price on this one isn't higher.  I'm now going to see what else I can find by Andy Weir.
B00BB8SKPW|5.0|Great movie, Washington in one of his best roles. The crash scene will keep you on the edge of your seat.  In general, the acting by all is fantastic.
B001NP8PQW|5.0|Three great shows with fantastic audio and video.  Cheaper than buying the albums!  The performances are excellent as well. It made me a cure fan!
B006BXTOFC|5.0|Really enjoyed this album-each track was good. Paid an awesome price for it and helps me get thru my workouts at a good clip. Def recommend.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|It is a great site I love the way they put the different bibles to study from. easy to use
1579129129|5.0|In our bodies, the framework for muscles, tendons and ligaments is the skeleton, topped by a skull, a face as unique as each creature itself.  Whether it be a reptile, primate, eel, catfish, frog, newt or penguin, the skull houses the central processing unit, the brain. This powers each animal, bird or snake.  Teeth highlight the jaw and in some, a prominent brow ridge or horns crown the whole in magnificent glory.<br /><br />Alan Dudley was fascinated by skulls.  At an early age, he found the body of a dead fox and brought it home to inspect it in greater detail.  However, prepping the skull for collection proved to be a bit of a trial.  Maggots, which feasted on the flesh of the carcass, were often a little overzealous, leading to damage of fine bone.  The alternative was to soak each skull in water for a very, very long period of time, allowing the natural bacteria to run their course.  This avenue proved to be extremely smelly, but very effective and at last, Dudley's collection began to grow in earnest.<br />Unfortunately, Dudley's zeal for collecting led him to obtain the skulls of a few endangered species, which ultimately progressed to his arrest.  Nevertheless, Dudley's collection remains one of the most detailed accounts of fauna on the planet.<br /><br />Kudos to Nick Mann's numerous photographs, too.  These illustrate with brilliant clarity the extensive variations in each skull, often from multiple angles.  This book is essential for zoologists and students of biology.  It is also a stunning, unique gift and a perfect accent for your coffee table.
B000002H70|5.0|If you aren't a die-hard cure fan, this is the one to get.  You get both depressing sonic  landscapes and fun pop tunes.  Truly an album that works well as a whole.  The live version on Trilogy might be even better.
B003N0XDT4|3.0|I'm profoundly Deaf. I got this so music would be loud enough to hear. I used to with my iMac with iMac and e7 volume both maxed and was able to hear music bass a bit. Enough to follow the beat. Downside is it only lasted about 3 months then it just suddenly stopped working.
B006TJXZ30|1.0|This is e-mail only.  The description said it would have all outlook.com functions, but it does not.  I was looking for calendar syncing.
B00621E94E|3.0|Lost built us up to certain expectations in the previous seasons and this season has been pretty lackluster so far.
B00821PCJS|3.0|but so is the writing talent.<br /><br />This show has amazing cg, great animatronics, a few good actors, but I'm not sure if it's the writing or directing, but it gets bogged down in a kind of melodrama that would be better for a sci-fi-set soap opera.<br /><br />Noah Wylie pretty much holds not only the characters together, but the show. Without him, it'd be a total wast.<br /><br />Having said that, if you like Stargate SG-1, you'll love Falling Skies, as it has a similar ethos.
B0055SWM08|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  The graphics are good.  Being able to earn hints keeps me going.  I know there is a sequel to this game available and I'll probably buy that one too.
B000IJ79WU|4.0|I read about this in a book on Superman and thot it interestting to see.  There are some decided quirks to it.  Not quite heart stopping but it would have been interesting if they had been in the first releas.e
B003WTE886|4.0|I like &#34;Mean&#34; and the title song &#34;Speak Now&#34; the best.  The other songs are OK.  Not as good as &#34;Fearless&#34; but it is OK on its own accord.
B008ASGP3U|5.0|Love the Malcolm Fox books but this is Rebus (Rankin) at his best. Maybe the Rebus sabbatical helped as this story has it all.<br /><br />Those who complain about a \\"weak ending\\" don't understand the sadness of Rebus' long journey as someone who just can't stop doing his job. Not every case should end with toasts and fist bumps. Maybe none of them should. Thanks for a great read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Great game!! For any age group. Everyone will enjoy this game. Play this when you have nothing to do, and no matter what you'll want to play it every chance you get...
B0095P31L6|1.0|This movie was so dumb, I felt myself staring in unbelief that it was even made.  My 5 year old and I watched about 15 minutes of it, and I looked at him and said this movie is terrible.  He agreed and asked if we could watch SpongeBob again.  We both had the same look of disbelief, I think we lost a few brain cells watching this.  I recommend that you spare yourself from this horror.
B005HQ5S3G|5.0|Song after song is riveting and good.  I would recommend this album and rank it high on my list of current favorites.  I especially like &#34;Dark Side&#34; and &#34;Honestly&#34;.
B009AMAGQM|5.0|I am a stickler for accuracy when it comes to film adaptations. I must say, the film adaptation of Beautiful Creatures was better than the book.<br />It cut through the endless high school scenes and cut to the chase to create the amazing movie I saw last night that left me speechless!<br /><br />Amma is no longer just Ethan Wate's housekeeper. She combine's two characters in one amazing role.<br /><br />Emma Thompson and Jeremy Irons steal the scenes they are in, while the supporting team Lena, Caster to be, and Ethan and Linc, hold their own in this Southern Gothic.<br /><br />It is the best adapting I've ever seen -- and I am adapting a book for the screen so I know what a delicate balance that is.<br />It is everything you need in a nutshell. If the others in the series are treated as this film is, I'll be first in line to see them.<br /><br />I will probably see it again and again and will get the DVD.<br /><br />Absolutely Beautiful Creatures that are fleshed out better than the book ever could.<br /><br />Buy this DVD!! The series is interesting, but the film is amazing!<br /><br />Ellen George, author and reviewer
B005721W9O|5.0|You don't have to be a science fiction fan to enjoy this movie, but it helps. It is very well done.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|I wish there were 10 stars to give for this.  It is so good.  Back to a wholesome tv show, with mystery, sexual tension, conflict, suspense, all without vulgarities.  I love it, I feel like they are part of my tv family.
B000051Y0G|5.0|&#34;Girls just want to have fun&#34; and other songs on the album turned Cyndi Lauper into a sudden success.  There are so many songs on this debut album that turned into instant hits, like &#34;Girls...&#34; and &#34;Time After Time&#34;.
B000JSI7DK|5.0|It's been a while since Rocky first appeared in theaters. The blu-ray version of this movie is the best it can be. What makes Rocky great is the story, the acting, and the direction. Don't look for big budget special effects. And yet the makers of the blu-ray still captured the detail that appeared in the original film. Check out the clarity of the picture of Sylvester Stallone and Burgess Meredith in the bottom right corner of the screen, when Rocky runs after Mickey outside Rocky's apartment. It's great.<br />As for the movie, it won Best Picture. Nuff said.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Television really doesn't get much better then this, the actors are terrific as is the script and scenery.  British TV series seems to be binary, either awful or awesome, this is clearly the latter.
B0094K1MH2|4.0|This was pretty good.  I thought some of the action went over the top of the top a few times.  I understand creative liberties, but there can be too many liberties taken.  All in all, it is a cartoon, and it was enjoyable.  Would watch another one if there was one.
B00006EXDM|5.0|Good Stones package, of the 60s and early (very early) 70s before they went Disco.  When their lyrics really meant something and were the sign of those turbulent times.  Riveting &#34;Mothers Little Helper&#34; and &#34;Street Fighting Man&#34; were lyrics that really mean a lot to our generation.
0375869026|5.0|I gave this book to my 9 yo, passionate reader, granddaughter. She lives a storied life: Napa Valley, great home life, loving grandparents who all have more than enough and are quick to share/treat. She is a princess and her reading, though copious, has always reflected this. I am so pleased that she has recommended this to her friends and loaned the book to her other grandmother. She has introduced her 4th grade teacher to the book and it is now being read by the class. Clearly, this has struck a cord with a little girl who is experiencing a taste of the real world, if only, so far, in literature.
B000IZ7YK6|4.0|This is a great film and I loved every minute of the movie.  Nicholson is terrific as usual and the balance of the cast is superb.  The scenes of old LA are terrific as is the old country side shots of southern California before it was overbuilt.  They did a wonderful job.  Seems like some pieces of the story are missing and probably ended up on the cutting room floor but oh well, still a classic.
B009VYF5E2|5.0|If you have not seen the other seasons check them out. the first season was my favorite. this is the last season on syfy right now sure will miss it
B001EYGOEM|5.0|&#34;You Belong with me&#34; and &#34;Love Story&#34; are excellent TS songs and this whole album is good.  I loved the part country/part rock and roll feel of it.
B009DCOU9S|4.0|good hidden object game.  not too hard buf<br />good.<br /><br />good hidden object game.  alittle too much dialog for me but guess its needed for the storyline.  not very difficult but entertaining.
B000HZED8S|4.0|Good action film, throw back to 1930's and 40's with high tech mixed in, lots of action and fun sci-fi.
B001N26GFC|5.0|I found this movie refreshing and pleasant to watch.  Different.  Nicely directed. Makes you wish more people were like her in your life.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Soulful soulful singing, breathtaking lyrics and on whole a great album.  What more can I say??  I like &#34;Turning Tables&#34; and &#34;Someone Like You&#34;.  It's different, beautiful and touching and moving.
B004XQO90O|5.0|A young man awakens on a Chicago commuter train, sitting opposite a young woman named Christina, who seems to know him.  The young man is confused.  He believes he is Captain Coulter Stevens, a helicopter pilot for the U.S. Army serving in the Middle East.  When a sudden explosion destroys the train, Stevens wakes up inside a darkened, instrumented metal capsule, listening over a radio to the voice of Air Force Captain Goodwin, who questions him on what just happened.  Stevens' nightmare has just begun...<br /><br />\\"Source Code\\" borrows a plot device from \\"Groundhog Day\\" and puts a sci-fy spin on it, repeatedly sending Stevens (Jake Gyllenhall) back to the train.  He learns from Goodwin that he has eight minutes to identify the bomber who sets off the explosion on the train, in order to prevent a worse incident.  In the course of a string of eight minute failures, each different, Stevens begins to form relationships with Goodwin (an excellent Vera Farmiga) and with Christina (Michelle Monaghan), and to ask awkward questions of both.<br /><br />Director Duncan Jones was wise to minimize the high tech time travel aspects of the story in favor of the relationships that actually drive the movie, and that will determine the uncertain futures of the three main characters.  \\"Source Code\\" is highly recommended to sci-fy fans.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Really loved this book. Author told it like it was with no sugar coating. Couldn't put it down. Hated to read the end of the book knowing in real life he was killed by a soldier he was trying to help.
B0017TYPIG|5.0|I saw this movie the first time at a drive-in movie theater in the '60s.  One of our regular family outings back then.  We had no idea we were going to see one of the best all time movies.  Shortly after that MAD MAGAZINE did a spoof of it called BLUE EYED KOOK.  I wish I had kept that issue now.  If you haven't seen it, you are one lucky turkey!  Get a copy.  You're going to want one!
B000UNYJXQ|5.0|This is something that should be said during the Bush era (GW is in the film), but now we have Obamacare so we'll see.  It's not as funny as Roger and Me but it says a lot about America and where we were compared to other countries that care for their sick.  I would recommend it to people who think our healthcare is sufficient.
B009LDXQGW|5.0|This album is a breath taking musical master piece from a true artist. The weekend has done the impossible by dropping a triple CD classic of mind blowing music. The weeknd singing style is eerily close to the late great MICHAEL JACKSON! YEAH I SAID IT, and if you don't believe me. Just check out the amazing remake of Dirty Diana titled \\"D.D\\". THE Weeknd is so smoove and subtle over the most chilled out ambiance of production that it feels like an intoxicated narcotic listening to THE TRILOGY album. This album caught me by surprise completely so, because I heard of THE WEEKND THROUGH music magazines. I assumed he was another audio tune Singer with no talent or<br /> substance. Boy was I wrong! I picked up the trilogy album at the last minute as I approached the cash register about to buy Joe BUDDENS new album but put it down and I copped TRILOGY\\". If MAXWELL AND SADE HAD A BABY IT WOULD OF BEEN THE WEEKND! His monolithic style and subtle tracks reminds me of the great musical legends over r-n-b's golden years. At barely 22 this artist has a more eclectic mature and balanced album than most artists twice his age. Some people complain about the profanity on the album but remember he is just 22. Besides the curse words fit perfectly into the groove rather than to be over the top like a lot of these singing thug/scrubs on the radio. The weeknd is a once in a lifetime artist. I'm so blown away by this beautiful album. I listened to the entire 3 disc album twice! I love it baby! I can't pick one favorite song because the whole triple album is fire! I'm a 100 percent fan for life. Shout out to DRAKE also for being the first celebrity to give THE Weeknd a mainstream look by linking his twitter to THE Weeknds music site. Its something special coming out of CANADA. \\"Its that north north\\", \\"that up top\\", \\"that OVO and that XO\\" . COP THIS ALBUM NOW AND BANG IT LOUD BECAUSE ITS DOPE! Genius at work. Thank you MR. ABEL TESTAFAYE AKA THE WEEKND. PEACE!
B007N5YIUS|5.0|...and frustrating as Hell. The gravity issues are can be so frustrating, but very challenging because the trajectories often don't work like they do here on Earth. Love it!!!
B009JBZH54|5.0|What else is there to say?  You can't go wrong with any of the Batman movies.  That is all there is to say about that!
B00006RAKP|5.0|Elton John was a superstar, and after listening to this album you know why.  Great lyrics, writing and music.  Simple as that.  Although I would include more of his early stuff on the album and not so much new.  His early stuff he was at his finest.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Couldnt put down! Cant wait for the movies!! Would recommend to anyone of any age. Truly a great set of books
B00AHXIC50|5.0|His best album out yet.  Bruno Mars has really hit it out of the park with this album.  I absolutely enjoy this album
B00AESN8XY|5.0|Just buy this game! After playing it until my Kindle battery died, I would have paid 5 times as much as I did!!!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Kelly Clarkson, at her very best.  Although I dont understand why some of these songs were on the &#34;greatest hits&#34; album.  But the other songs make up for it.  It even has her current hit &#34;Catch My Breath&#34;.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Couldnt put down! Cant wait for the movies!! Would recommend to anyone of any age. Truly a great set of books
B005K0HDGE|5.0|His ability to simply bring to life things that you wouldn't normally think would be worth reading and make it absolutely spell binding.  He is the &#34;King&#34;.  Great story, highly recommend it so far and I am only 30% thru the book.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|What might normally be considered a &#34;chick flick&#34; type of series is definitely suitable for everybody. I've been able to convert quite a few men into Downton Abbey followers. ~smiles~ Love the storylines and the cast.
B009YP9L7U|1.0|It was pretty lame, but that's just my opinion. eleven ten nine eight seven six five four three two one
B006LSZECO|3.0|I enjoy reading about people with character and integrity - not mental illness unleashed without growth and hope for humanity, sad.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I have always enjoyed John Grisham, but this is one of his best.  I think you need to get this book and give yourself some time to read it without interuptions
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book is filled with twists and turns and is uniquely written.  I could not put it down.  Every time I thought I had it figured out it took a new turn.  Absolute must-read.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|If you like Temple Run then you'll like Subway Surfers. No more tilting, you just slide you finger the way you want to go. It's just like Temple Run but with subways. One of the most addicting games ever!
B009WO7NQO|5.0|Though the Kindle is technically mine, my husband and son love this game.  There are lots of fun tricks and special tools you can use to make it even more exciting.  It's nice to have a game that can be equally enjoyed by all ages.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|It has the feel of a fairy tale. It is visually beautiful. The characters are carefully crafted and highly representative of the era.
B009DTI0IS|5.0|This is a must have for any true Pearl Jam fan and will make anyone who is only a regular fan into a hard core fan.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|It's a really cool app if you like running apps and games fin and interesting if you also know temple run.
B000UZNSWM|4.0|Gives a very detailed view of the Korean war from primarily the US perspective.<br />Also goes into the politics of the war.
B002PJL85K|1.0|My family and I like a lot of \\"bad\\" movies(Conan the Barbarian, anyone?), and are willing to overlook a lot for a good story.  However, Nigel Terry as Arthur was so, so terribly bad that it was distracting.  There should have been a Mystery Science 3000 done off of this, it was that bad.  We got about halfway through and a combination of boredom and disgust at the ridiculous acting prompted us to turn it off.
B00BHMF578|4.0|I was reluctant to see this movie simply because we already new the ending. But I was pleasantly surprised. They managed to keep you on the edge of your seat at the end. Great job by the cast.
B008476HBM|4.0|I loved the plot. However, since this is an old book, the plot was alittle confusing. One of the best love stories of all time.
0439023483|4.0|PURCHASED FOR GRANDAUGHTER (SHE WANTED THE BOOK IN HARDBACK) .  BOOKED LABEL 'USE' - THE BOOK I RECEIVED COULD HAVE BEEN PASSED OFF AS NEW!  EXCELLENT CUSTOMER SERVICE.  WILL PURCHASE FROM THIS VENDOR AGAIN!

0785163174|2.0|I desperately wanted to like this story, but it fell far below the bar of anything solid.  The sole purpose of this book is just to have our heroes duke it out.  I loved the Marvel vs DC Amalgam match ups back in the 90's when I was ten and story and character didn't matter.  I expect a lot more out of Marvel, especially with all the talent they have on board.  Too many characters mindlessly fighting, no real attempts at resolving the issues peaceably, and frustrating ideologies contribute to a lackluster event.  I think Marvel needs to spend more time developing quality villains so they don't have to resort to more hero vs hero infighting.  Again.  I never became invested in any of the characters, just frustrated that they were all acting stupidly.  At least those possessed with the Phoenix Force had an excuse.<br /><br />The second half of the book is a complete waste of space; just fights with no purpose.  Luckily they read fast because my attention was barely there at that point.  The one redeeming quality is the art.  John Romita, Jr., Oliver Coipel, and Adam Kubert deliver some amazing art.  Save your money.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Hey everybody if u like or love angry birds games....you'll love your trip to rio via the birds....it gives you a different version altogether where the birds are in need of help....the birds that are being held captive need the fellow birds to help them escape...you will not be targeting pigs but it still gives you a decent challenge.......I'm a angry birds addict and if you are too I think you will love this too..
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Anybody who is dealing with an abusive partner should read it and get out of the situation.  I'm not in this situation, but it's very informative.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Really enjoyed this book.The story line was good and liked the author's style. Will look for other books from her. I will likely read this again.
B008476HBM|3.0|Must admit that I only read it so that I can say that it is done. I found this a bit slow. All character development and gossip and very little action. Some people love it, just not me. Side note: I read it using the kindle app on my iPad and didn't have any of the problems mentioned with font size and spacing that some others mentioned.
B0084BMUFA|5.0|Have liked this book for years.  It's just not Christmas if I don't read about Scrooge or see a movie about him.
1936608898|3.0|wish there was a little more info on how to change the way we cook,, and some meal planning, rather than just explanations of what is wrong with the way we eat
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Loved the full ride of the series  an excellent read  you gave a great story thank you s o very much
B00APJLFEG|4.0|My five year old thought it was cute, and I didn't mind watching it. We would both watch it again.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|Abyss. The Wraiths of Eden......  A good and interesting game. Moves along very well. does not lag like some.  G5 games are usually pretty good, and this one is.
B00AZL3PBK|4.0|The game looked like a version of Mario so I tried it out. It is similar to Mario. I like it and found it hard to stop playing once I started.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I could not put this book down.  It shows you should not underestimate the teenage mind and strengh.  I would recomment this book to young and old alike.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|When i first started the game it was great now it has ads popping up every few minutes and is growing to be a pain!!
B0094BB4TW|4.0|I'm not on Facebook often but connect once in a while. This app is like the other Android app I have on my phone. I have found on problems or issues when using it.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|For a Nicholas Sparks book it was really good. I loved seeing the chapters through different characters eyes. Good twist in it too.
B00785P2QC|3.0|A suitable time waster. I'd appreciate if it was less social though. Not everything needs to be linked to facebook and Twitter and email and foursquare and LinkedIn and you get my point
B008JGSM6G|4.0|I just received my Kindle Fire and started playing this game.  Before I knew it, I had been playing for about an hour!  Thanks, Amazon!
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great book by this author. Good plot but ending not believable. Otherwise was good.  I don't have 20 more words to say
B0094BB4TW|2.0|its good that there's finally a facebook app, but whenever you try to write a status and you type a specific word, a tag suggestion pops up and if you don't tags the person/page it automatically erases your word and adds a period
B0063GORYU|5.0|Lots of fun, fast-paced, addictive! The game is easy to learn with clear directions...and helps if you need them! Great Fun Game!
B0095ZQ36G|5.0|First time I ever saw my husband read a book, lay it down, pick it back up and read it over again.  He has told everyone about this book and purchased it for gifts.  He is anxiously awaiting Makos' next book in April.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I happened across this series on amazon.  Liked that it was something different. Once I started to read, so intriguing I couldn't stop. Very impressed with this author's abilities to make everything so descriptive-believable! Can't wait to start next silo saga series. Thank you Hugh howey
B00881VLCE|5.0|Fun and relaxing to play.  It is very Similar to a real puzzle, but easier.  I like the pictures, especially the Anne Geddes photos.
B009UX2YAC|1.0|I hats this app. I use to think it was fun, till it erased everything. I even bought double coins, but gone.
B001QWBM62|4.0|Zoom claims that this is a recording studio that fits into the palm of your hand. While that might be a slight exaggeration, it certainly has enough capabilities to make field or portable recording very easy in an extremely compact device. The dual mics are perfect for field recording and even interviews. The dual XLR inputs with phantom power make recording studio or live performances a breeze. Some of the editing features, while powerful, are a little hard to get used to, but overall setup is pretty easy and the most-used controls are hard buttons that are easy to find.<br /><br />This might be usable by beginners to recording, but I would recommend buying one of the tutorial DVDs from proaudiodvds.com to get you up to speed faster.
B0032FPVKE|5.0|Nice and compact, holds both my HD recorder and digital camera, plus side and back secure pockets for small items.  It's definitely not adequate for any equipment hauling, but for a nice small bag, well worth the price.  A great item to go with a large camera bag.
B001NHNG64|4.0|Jack does it again, with militia and a constant hostage situation Jack MUST overcome the odds set against him and try to save hundreds of lives on the process.
B00A2LFXVI|5.0|Great continution to the  frist part the battle seans with superman are something i hope the next storey is just as good
0062200909|5.0|This book absolutely enchantes me, with its pictures and its background information.  The actors relating how they saw themselves played the different characters, was very interesting.  It amazes me to see the vast amount of work involved in bringing this film to the screen.  I have always enjoed the saga of Middle Earth, and I look forward to the next installment.  JRV
B00006CXSS|5.0|Liked the interviews with the actual participants in the story. 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 0
B009MF5BXK|5.0|whats to say when you have the best action heros. to play thease roles i hope there a three to come out
B000E1ZBGS|5.0|This is one of the best directed, visually stimulating, well acted, beautifully scripted films of all time.  It makes you believe in love!
B004SGWYW4|5.0|I bought this item for my husband and daughter.  They loved this anime.  Great storyline.  No complaints here at all.
B0034G4P80|5.0|Whats to say hope a part 2 is just as good a part 1. the storey line was good. ok
B0094BB4TW|4.0|Thank you for fixing the newsfeed issue! Much better than before. Would be nice to be able to go to game apps like Candy Crush, but I can deal for now.
B005IUP624|2.0|I bought this book because I thought it was basically about Anorexia.  But, most of the book was about Portia de Rossi being an actress/model & a lesbian...none of which I am the least bit interested in.  I realize that was her life so it factored in to her eating disorder but I just thought too much of the book was about that & not the eating disorder.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|A truly thought provoking, and possibly life changing book.  Very worthy of anyone's time, regardless of how busy they are in other aspects of their lives.
B00BGDQNLU|1.0|What a terrible movie this is - quite a absurd story line. They must have paid the late Paul Newman a considerable sum to degrade himself in this abomination. I hope PN used his ill advised gains in making more salad dressing for charity.<br /><br />Don't waste your time and money with this nonsense.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Haven't liked a Bond film this much since I was 10 and saw &#34;From Russis With Love&#34; and &#34;Goldfinger&#34;; Daniel Craig is more Bond than Sean Connery.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|Read first, before you start the Gone Girl and i guess it will make a better impact. Intriguing and dark, kept in good pace.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|This book was amazing, I could not put it down. It was a light read and enjoyable. Definitely worth the price
B009CPJHY4|5.0|This is an enchanting movie.  The characters develop and grow throughout the entire movie.  My husband and I quite loved this little sleeper of a movie.  It's funny, it's sad...and in the end, it's quite lovely.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I finished it in three days (working full time). Nicely arranged, great suspensions. it was recommended by a friend and i can only recommend it further.
B009JBZH54|5.0|I loved having all the Batman movies in one package.  It's definitely a must have if you are a Batman fan.
B005LAIHPY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.  It's fast moving, fun, suspenseful and patriotic at the same time.  Especially loved the Navy, the  Missouri and her crew saving the day (not to mention the world!).  Will most definitely watch this one over and over again!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I truly enjoyed this book! My 8th graders wouldn't stop talking about it and NOW, I have another way to relate to my academic babies. :-)
B008EZVNFE|4.0|Unique and fresh, but a lush retro sound. Great talent. Looking forward to what La Havas has in store for us next.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Temple run 2 is so awesome. I love the ziplines and the rivers you have to jump over. The characters are a bit better. The graphics are really good. Five stars.
B008BRC7BE|5.0|killer  cd , every track is  off the hook even the remies .  been a sabbath fan for years since i was 7  and  thatsalong time  same with deep purple  and ian gillain ..  these  two  guys  threw some  killer ass jams 2gether .
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I give this game a big high five.very kid friendly.lots too do on this game.my daughter love's it.....it is for every one to. And it has very good picture.
B001AQMBNC|5.0|Lets just say seeing this on bluray is the best way you can view besides seeing it in a theater.  This looks like you just set up a projector in your house and then view it.  The colors are awesome and the sharpness is excellent since this is film.
B0007YNRTK|4.0|This is pure Bobby creations of melodic sounds and vocal vibrations. Bobby sings in this soundtracks, all the weariness and stiff of going &#34;Across 110th Street .&#34;
B007R0WHMK|5.0|My first time watching seen the preview on another movie been looking for it to watch and you had it on your movie list.  I  love it and would watch it again.  Will recommend to others who hasn't seen it.
B008BQ8VOC|5.0|I usually only watch science, true crime, or forensic shows because situation drama/comedies bore me... but NOT THIS SHOW!!<br />I love the fast paced wit and sense of humor! I already own every episode and I can't wait for the next season!!
B001N44BVQ|5.0|Ordered this and it arrived quickly. Brand new as listed. Good price. Gave as a gift. Great deal. Very happy.
B001GM28HO|5.0|My daughter loves this product and enjoy listen , wasn't finding it at store so decided to get while the price was good.
0061122416|3.0|That is the flavor of it, but it does cause one to think-which is the point-is it not? Check this one out:[[ASIN:1481957104 The Sacred Spring of the Blood Royal: The Secret Order of the Grail]]I just read this new book, and it somehow reminded me of Coehlo's stories, but better written.
B000P0J0EW|5.0|Ordered this and it arrived quickly. Brand new as listed. Good price. Gave as a gift. Great deal. Very happy.
B00933JL0A|5.0|I played this game on a cheap android phone I had. Love the new version of it. Very good game!
B004SIP6BI|3.0|I remembered loving this movie way back when (who wouldn't? Delicious Johnny Depp) but I'm not as much in love with it now.  It's still lovely.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|My family loves this game. My 4 year old loves it. My husband I both love it. My 9 year old loves it. My 12 year old loves it.
B006LSZECO|2.0|It's supposed to be not-put-down-able.  I  found I was very able to put it down after getting maybe 1/3 way through it.  I guess the suspense didn't grab me enough, or sometimes when I just finished a book I really loved, I can't get into the next one.
B001FB55MG|5.0|Ordered this and it arrived quickly. Brand new as listed. Good price. Gave as a gift. Great deal. Very happy. Great movie!!!!
B005P1YCNK|5.0|One of the reasons why so many of us set goals and fail to achieve them is because we set them too high,  i.e. \\"I'm going to lose 50 lbs\\"  but instead of setting ridiculously high goals we should achieve the smaller goals on a daily basis,  for example \\"I'm going to lose 2 lbs a week\\" this daily consistency is what ultimately helps us to achieve the goals that we once thought were impossible.  This is pretty much what the author Darren Hardy is explaining to the audience in this book.  I think that this is a good starter book and shows the reader how to achieve massive success with simple positive choices.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's so cool it it's fast fun and so so cool my little son loves it to definitely for kids
B004MPRWJG|5.0|I came across this story as a movie first but when I read this book, it was even more touching than the movie.
B006LSZECO|5.0|A well written novel with a plot twist I didn't see coming and the conclusion leads to speculation as to the ultimate outcome.
B008MG1E4A|4.0|Well written, short and to the point.  Gave a reason for writing, politicians were leaking information anyway and profits were going to charity.
B0015DROBO|5.0|The suspense was awesome, and I found myself rooting for a killer.  Nicely tied up at the end much better than the movie.
B004UNX1LS|2.0|I know it is free but the commercials and the low quality of videos playing even in \\"High\\" make this a real headache to use. Avoid this waste of time.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so much fun I can't stop playing it once you start playing you won't be able to stop
1603427244|4.0|very good pictures and good advice on which method to use in casting on or binding off.  Easy to follow.  thanks for a great book.
B008AK8FHM|5.0|thought provoking- i'm not sure i believe it but it is an interesting story and worth the read. great job
B0096PYUE2|2.0|Okay, but did not do what I needed. work with Amazon and come up with a fix please that may make it work like the ADOBE Flash Player.
B003QTSMXE|4.0|I had a hard time trying to get it to download to my kindle and ended up showing my son on the computer. That was not what I wanted.

B004J4WLB4|5.0|Victoria began as a damaged person who needed help to heal enough in order to move on. Elizabeth was able to use her short comings to give Victoria comfort, good food, and understanding in her maternal style.
B007HACDLK|5.0|This one is a five star because Vince Flynn just keeps getting better and better with our man Mitch Rapp!!
B0017I91LI|4.0|I thought I was buying a movie cd, and not required to down load it,so I deleted it by mistake, and haven't been able to contact amazon, as they do not except emails and have no contact number. This amazon site sucks!!!! Big Time
B00A8ECU24|1.0|The game itself was entertaining but later on the quests require you not only to have friends to give you hearts, but -- here's the kicker -- I've played a lot of free games and this one was the most blatantly greedy. You get very few gems (and yet they are soooo easy to buy with *real* money) naturally progressing through the game, whereas coins come easily at higher levels, and there was a point in the game where I had FOUR SOLID QUESTS to advance the storyline that all required gems! That was a total of something like 400+ gems! I'd already spent a good $20 on these stupid gems over the course of playing the game (most Kindle play games only cost what, $5 and you get ALL the content? That's as much as a good used XBox 360 game fer crissakes!) and they wanted me to spend at least $20 more! Uh uh. Not happening. That s*** is sneaky and low down and you aren't getting any more of my money.<br /><br />It's also glitchy for Kindle but they recently did a patch that fixed it, so hoorah for them. Make gems easier to get naturally in the storyline and I will consider downloading this game again.
B006LSZECO|5.0|I haven't finished it yet, but can't wait to. Certainly has kept me guessing! A pleasure to look forward to each evening.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|I love this movie!!! I just got a blu-ray player for Christmas so I'm trying to relace my dvd library with blu-rays.<br />I couldn't believe the bargain this was plus I have an extra dvd I can leave at work.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This app works very well and is visually attractive. Works perfectly on the kindle fire hd 8.9. It is helpful to see how much battery life I have by type of apps I am using. Helpful also for making trade-off between brightness (which I love) versus battery life especially if I am going to be without a power source for some time.
B009LXECF6|5.0|I have Doo-Wops & Hooligans which I LOVE.  I wanted the new cd without the &#34;bad&#34; words.  I found it on Amazon, of course.<br />Once again, I LOVE the new Bruno Mars cd.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Great for simple math  and replaces other calculators. it's quick with big buttons to see easily. I would recommend it.
B00499NHLC|5.0|Excellent interpretation of Sherlock Holmes, remains faithful to Doyle's writings and melds the original stories well in present day England. Cumberbatch portrays the cerebral anti-hero to perfection, both immensely likable and frustrating. The editing and camerawork to show the character's thought process, received text messages, etc. is well done, and an interesting way to convey plot lines without having cumbersome dialogue for explanations. Overall, a very well executed and entertaining update on Sherlock Holmes.
B0058DRUV6|5.0|Every leader, board member, c suite exec and mba student should read this book and prescribed to its foundations. Classic perspectives on what keeps good companies from their demise by bringing in the outside leadership teams.  Combine this with &#34;the leadership engine&#34; and you have the perfect formula for long-term success.
B00136NVH4|5.0|The classics are always the best. They are the people who can actually carry a musical note when they sing. Meatloaf can deafintely do that.
B000LPQ6DE|5.0|I love this version. It used to be my favorite, but the newest version (with Michael Fassbender) has usurped it.  But I still love this, it's longer and tells the story thoroughly.
B00A1XIXM8|4.0|Over the last 30 years, Bad Religion has proved themselves as one of the most<br />prolific, political and philosophic punk rock bands that the genre has ever seen.<br />Their work ethic is equally impressive with constant touring and consistently<br />releasing of high quality albums that are guaranteed to make you use your gray<br />matter and enlighten you on the important issues facing this world. Hell, you<br />might even learn a new word or two with Greg Graffin’s extensive and impressive<br />vocabulary.<br /><br />As opposed to their last album, The Dissent of Man, True North is more straight-<br />forward in its approach with hard hitting punk rock tracks. The majority of the<br />songs feature an accelerated tempo and many of the songs are considerably faster<br />than those on The Dissent of Man, which had considerably more melodic and<br />harmonious songs (e.g., “Avalon,” “I Won’t Say Anything,” “Cyanide,” etc.). That’s not<br />to say True North doesn’t feature some similar style songs, such as “Dharma and the<br />Bomb,” “In Their Hearts is Right,” and “Hello Cruel World,” but in the end, the songs<br />are generally more aggressive. There were three songs specifically on this album<br />that struck a chord with me, those being the title track, “True North,” “Robin Hood in<br />Reverse” and “Dharma and the Bomb.” There isn’t a weak link to be found, as it is an<br />extremely well rounded album and worthy addition to your punk rock collection. If<br />you’ve enjoyed The Empire Strikes First, New Maps of Hell and The Dissent of Man,<br />you’ll thoroughly enjoy Truth North.<br /><br />For those who have been anticipating an extremely solid and intense Bad Religion<br />album, your wait is over. The band’s 16th studio album is one of the best they’ve<br />released in the last 15 years.
B0053Q9DHW|5.0|I'm a big Jane Eyre fan. I've read the book several times and have seen all the movie versions I can find.  I saw this version the theater and enjoyed it, but was surprised at how different it was from the book.  Now I've seen it on DVD a few times and it has grown on me, and it's definitely my favorite version.  The actors and actresses are excellent.  I like the pacing and timing of the plot, and how they put the end of the story at the beginning as a flashback.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|At first I thought it was going to be boring because all these historical and political background. I am not a huge fan of those kinds of movies. The ones that I saw were always boring and very long but this was different for all the suspense and how the movie really make you feel all the pain and desperation of the people who were caught. I hope wins the Oscar.
B00006L7XQ|5.0|A very fine Cash CD, maybe the best. You hear Cash at his most sublime and in his voice the depth of his experiences.
B003W77SAS|5.0|Great album from beginning to end. This would be the ONE ELO album I'd have if someone told me I could only have one.
0345529057|5.0|An awesomely written, fantastically imagined series. All of the books up to this point have been amazing. I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys fantasy/epics, and for others this might be the series that draws them to this genre. Can not wait for the rest of the books to be published!
B000001DYY|5.0|I know there are other albums they did that are &#34;better&#34;. But this one is special to me for many sentimental reasons. That said, it is a great album! Almost every song is incredibly crafted and easy to listen too. If you like TFF and don't have this album, you're missing a gem.
B001EBYM8A|5.0|Great Movie with lots ofexcitment. This is one of Harrison Ford's best movies. Great supporting cast. I loved Tommy Lee Jones in this movie.
B005LAII12|3.0|I CHOSE THIS ITEM, BECAUSE HEARD IT WAS A GREAT MOVIE, I WOULD'NT RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO ANYONE, NOT GOOD FOR CHILDREN, ITEM PACKED GREAT.
B007FEFLTO|3.0|Predictable paths for the main characters. Was a stretch to get in the history of WWII and still keep the story moving. The linked characters intersected in awkward or clumsy ways. Book one was a four or five star.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I decided to find out what everyone was talking about with Downton Abbey, and since I have Amazon Prime I have been able to watch seasons one and two on streaming video.  The show is awesome!  The Costumes are beautiful and I am now able to understand a little better about the class system, something we have a hard time understanding in America.  There was no crossing the lines of class then, and everyone understood this, until Tom came along.  I'm looking forward to finishing season three so I can be ready for the next season.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was on my radar due to a lot of the negative buzz regarding the marketing of the film.  Sadly, I honestly believe critics bought into the \\"bad marketing\\" hype and just wanted to make the movie fail.  I picked up the movie on 3D Blu-ray and I watched it waiting for the movie to start to suck or be \\"confusing\\".  Interestingly, that never happend, but what did start happening was I became more and more engrossed in a different world filled with fully realized cultures and characters.  Dazzling special effects and a story that just pulls you in.  The picture on the Blu-ray is also stellar and the 3D adds depth to the image making the world of Barsoom (Mars) come fully to life.  I enjoyed the movie so much, that I've been reading Edgar Rice Burroughs Mars Trilogy.  I highly recommend this movie.
B000NQRE1E|5.0|I CHOSE THIS ITEM, BECAUSE I LOVE THE MOVIE, I WOULD RECOMMEND THIS ITEM TO EVERYONE OF ALL AGES, ITEM PACKED GREAT.

B00AYB0TOW|5.0|i read all the original comics when i was a kid, having stolen them from my older brothers and hiding them in with feminine products of my mothers.  i want a lawgiver.  i want a motorcycle that is like Kit from knight rider.  this was a departure from the original story line, but i like seeing all the special effects.
B003EYVXUU|5.0|I think this could be one of my top three vampire films of all time.  The only draw back is a lot of it is exactly like the original foreign version which is really good as well.  Watch it, love it, but remember the director did a lot of swipping.
B00AB0AR2U|5.0|i love love these movies and i am going to watch every single one of them that they make.  i also want one of those spiders on my chest to make me superstrong and evil until someone bashes it off of me
B000QUUD60|5.0|We got this for our 2.5 year old twins who really took to the YouTube clips of Elvis my husband showed them.  We picked this one in particular because it has 'Patch It Up' on it - the girls favorite song.  It runs straight through showing some studio time, then Elvis' comeback concerts in Vegas.  It is a big hit at our house!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|Subway sufers is so fun it is like teple run but it is better because it is more challenging then temple run.

B00B5HQKNI|5.0|Okay so if you buy the high def version of this video for $15 you get the option to watch the standard version when you stream it from amazon, for all of you looking for the standard version.
B00BHU9BV6|2.0|It is not a regular movie... Think Moulin Rouge with out singing... I think they lived in a theatre on stage??  Whatever, love period pieces, completely hatred this one.

B0032UYFA6|5.0|Purchased as a birthday gift for son-in-law.  He enjoys these types of movies.  I will be ordering again for him and others.
B009X2CVXA|4.0|Although I didn't enjoy this book as much as The Secret Keeper, I still found it an enjoyable read.  It was a little disjointed, switched from past to present without warning in the middle of a chapter.  This was the only thing that stopped me giving this five starts..  I do enjoy Kate's books and I love her daily blog, worth reading her books to become familiar with her blog

B001FBSMF8|5.0|Chris Cornell is an amazing talent. This CD shows his range. The genre is hard to describe, it's kind of like techno, hip hop, blues rock with extraordinary lyrics and vocals.
B007XKEY6Q|2.0|Just started to get this error message. &quot;Error Marmalade 5.2.1 Too many controls in layoutmanager&quot; then the game force closes. Kindle Fire HD.
1400049628|4.0|I found this book a great help in the recent Level 1 out break. I was able to safely get rid of the few Zombies in the infected area. I would have gave the book 5 stars but it did not go into any optics on your Zombie slaying firearms. Also Max's recommended ammunition for a hunt is a little low, I brought double the amount and only had about 100 rounds left. A Zombie coming at you at 100 yards is truly scary. Other than that a great guide in dealing with the undead.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|Well I know why it's called angry birds. it's makes you &quot;angry&quot; if you don't pass a hard level, don't have enough birds on some levels, and the green pigs grit their teeth at you and &quot;start to mock you&quot; if you don't pass lol
B004OBQDHK|5.0|Classic action flick with everything a must have on Blu Ray, Special features are a bit repetitive, No Keanu Reeves interview. But Over all the movie outshines a lot of current day action flicks which are relying on big explosions and cgi not that they are bad but Point break is just proof that a good story and a group of good actors can make a movie special.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was exciting and absolutely t he best book in . The w world everyone should read it really amazing
B00AAZOKS8|4.0|We love all of S. BOYNTON`s books. Cute short and lots of fun. You can't go wrong with this one.
B0031RAOW8|5.0|From the very beginning, how could you not fall in love with Hachi?  Just a magnificent story of how a dog can become man's best friend, truly devoted to him.
B008K3HRF0|5.0|I love this movie. It's a classic in my book. I love the message behind it and it has a superb cast.
B008I43DYU|5.0|It's a nice calculator that takes up the entire screen: Big numbers, Big keys, Easy to read, Easy to use.
B001MTENOC|5.0|The idea of souls incarnating is an intriguing concept. Mr. Newton does a wonderful job of interpreting what is presented to him from the case histories of his subjects.
B005VT42BS|5.0|An extremely worthwhile tool. Lists all  of the IP addresses nearby. Essential for diagnosing network design and trouble shooting issues such as adding new computers or printers. Note: a basic understanding of networks and ip addresses is required. Amazingly, they have versions for PC, Mac, Android, Kindle, and iPad.
0345803493|4.0|I've not finished reading yet...still finishing last of Fifty Shades of Grey.  Nothing more needed said, right? Thank you, Laurel
B007REV4YI|4.0|This is a mostly fast-paced action and intrigue story about Bond, M, Q, the villain, and more, and it will keep you on the edge of your seat during most scenes.  I am not a huge Craig fan but he does do a great job as Bond. Bardem is a slimy good villain, and Judi Dench is at her best.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|i dont think i have liked a new mariah song more than this one in years, happy to see no rappers for rent, it sounds new and fresh. If she dose her new cd in this fashion. I will buy it. have not bought the last three. great work M.C. Now give us more of this. its great.
B0069JBKHI|4.0|Overall, I really do like this monitor. That said, I always use a cheap audio monitor at night and while he's napping. I use this monitor to check on him when I hear him make noises or when I just want to peek on him and not wake him up. The withings monitor just isn't consistent enough for long term use, and it kills your iPhone or ipad battery. But it is really nice when you want to check on them without going in the room and waking them. I also love that when he wakes up too early in the am, I can turn on the nightlight and sound from my bed and that usually keeps him occupied until I get up or until I finish getting ready. He's also figured out how to turn them on and will do so himself now at 9 months. It's pricey, but worth every penny when you want to watch them breathe at night!
B000G7PMD2|5.0|This set contains a good sample of their work throughout the years.  It's well produced to boot so it sounds great.<br /><br />I could use this as a Dream Theater starter kit.
B009LT1YZ6|2.0|I don't care for this game too much...  it's not too user friendly  at all...... and graphics are boring...  I find it tiring on my hands too.

B006MW3UZW|5.0|I had heard a lot about this series so I started watching; it's great!  and it's free on Prime!  Almost done with season 2.  staying off all news sources as I heard there was a shocker in the next season that I don't wanna know about quite yet!
B006WQLH7G|5.0|We have always loved Avast. It is non-intrusive into our programs, just does it's job in the background. Highly recommended!
B0085KGGHI|4.0|I'm happy with this purchase. arrived in a couple days and was enjoyable to view and hear, as expected. Used a gift card which was a simple and convenient process
B00846REIS|2.0|I'm sorry to say this book was very predictable. Although the basis for the story line was entertaining and I did like this book much more than the Fifty Shades of Grey series (which it is sometimes compared to), it was still very basic; it seemed to be missing something.  All in all, it wasn't a bad read, it just wasn't an anticipation building page turner.
B004I744AS|5.0|This is a outstanding app for your Kindle Fire. It is very ease to use and allows you to look up words in the dictionay as you need them. And then, It is FREE!! You cant go wrong.
B008IJTFYW|4.0|Love it.I have used this app on more than one occasion to help me fall asleep. Talk about some good rest when I learned that when you swipe to the left you can intensify the underlying beats to deepen sleep and concentration.
B003TH14H4|5.0|Loved this episode. Will watch it again. You will get  hooked on this show and its characters. Can't wait for new episodes.
B00A85EMVK|1.0|This one of my favorite movies from my childhood. The reason I am giving it one star is the quality on the 3d Blue ray is so bad that it makes VHS tapes look good. The picture is so grainy that there is one scene in the beginning when there flying back to the aircraft carrier at night that you can barely makke out the jet against the night sky. That is how bad it is. I did not expect the 3d effect to be stellar since it was being converted from a movie from 1986. But, did expect the picture quality not to be so grainy and look like garbage. The non-3d blue ray looks fantastic and did enjoy the regular blue ray. I will never watch the 3d version again becsuse the 3d quality is so bad that it is unwatchable. Paramount should give everyone who bought this a rebate of $10 for everyone who got suckered it being buying the 3d version because it so bad.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|this is a good game Because u get a varity of games this is something I would let my niece play too
B00BHNQ5XK|3.0|I would be giving this a 4, very original and creepy. But too much of this film was shot in the dark, therefor it gets a three. When you hear a bump in the night, you don't roam around your house in total darkness.  You would flip on a light or two or a the very least grab a flashlight. The most this guy used was the light from his cell phone. This makes me wonder if they even had a set for filming?
B009G78EE2|5.0|Friends have been recommending me to this dude for months and I finally bought it. I love it hands down. In one of his songs he raps about how he feels about being labeled a White &#34;Conscious&#34; rapper and I feel like those feelings sum up this entire album. Love Love love this album.
B000NMW6M0|3.0|I hated the background and environment of this film. I stopped it twice, then went back later. I don't think this was Brad Pitts best  performance.  Maybe this would have been better on a larger screen but on Kindle it appeared small and uninteresting to me.<br />I eventually watched it all but somehow I couldn't get into it.
B00000427L|4.0|This music helps me to relax and enjoy the time listening.  Love the theme from movie &#34;Somewhere in Time.&#34; Very enjoyable
B007SZ0E1K|5.0|Obviously with all these positive reviews you know this is a good product.  I bought it for gaming in the hopes that all those opinions were valid and that this chip lived up to the hype.  Well, it does.  Completely.  In fact, if such a thing is possible, it outperforms the hype.  If it lasts as well as it performs then it will be in a category all its own.  If you want a gaming computer and a processor that does that expertly, this is the chip for you.
0446541478|5.0|This is the book I was waiting to understand how this country has reached such economic level and how Israelis behave when doing businesses. You must read it if you are interested in this field. Thanks Dan Senor to publish this book
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I couldn't stop playing until all the levels were played.  It took all my spare time. I had l<br />ots of fun!
B0095ZMMCK|5.0|Very well written and easy to read. Even though it's a long book, it reads very fast. I also find it amazing how much of what was in the book I am seeing in the news headlines today regarding the Chinese military cyber spying.
B00957T6X6|5.0|This was the first set I bought for my Kindle and it is making for great reading.  It's really handy to have the complete series (at least so far but hopefully they're be more) in one place.  It also saved me money from buying each individual book.  A great purchase all around.
B0002JJBZY|5.0|I bought it for my son.  He was happy to receive it.  As far as I know he loves it.
B0099Y2MYK|5.0|This is a wonderful series and my whole family watches and loves it.  Also, for me, it has closed captioning which I need.  Would recommend it to everyone.
B008B3MZMY|5.0|I was just a teen when Supertramp were the biggest band in the world, and I never got to see them live. I did wear out several vinyl and cassette copies of Paris, so I was very familiar with the audio of their live sound. Now with this DVD I get to see the video as well. The DVD is not the same as the Paris CD, so you are getting a slightly different set list. If you love the Paris CD, this will be like hearing familiar music but just enough difference to make this seem fresh and new. Some of the songs were not filmed and have audio only. This is a slight disappointment, but not enough to dock it a star. Also John's intro to &#34;Breakfast In America&#34; is different (and shorter) on the DVD. If you have the audio capability, choose DTS Surround.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Good 3D picture.  LIke when the fish pop out of the TV.  Kids love the movie and have watched it several times
B000068FXR|4.0|After finding a box of old cassettes in my attic, I decided to give this one a try on CD.I bought a few of their CDs over the years and after getting the Live In Paris DVD, I started to fill in the gaps in My Supertramp collection. I hadn't heard it in at least 15 years, but I still remembered most of the words. I also remembered that it was a good album, but not as good as Crime of The Century.
B003WUYRGI|1.0|This  book was very unorganized  there needed some sort of search bar to search for certain words. Because sometimes u need a certain word.
B000068FXX|4.0|If &#34;Babaji&#34; were not on this CD, I would give it 5 stars. The other songs are high quality. I owned this years ago on vinyl and cassette and this is my first experience with the CD sound and to me the remastering sounds great.
0439023521|4.0|I could not put this book down.  I tried to ration myself to just a few pages a day, but this was impossible.
B000069HJI|3.0|This was Roger Hodgson's last album with Supertramp and a lot of it seems phoned in. The audio quality is the usual Supertamp high quality, but the songs that jump out at you are few and far between.
B003ODIZL6|5.0|The book was very helpful. Boobies are yummy. Because they have milf. I think you should use the book. Boobies.
B000002GAF|5.0|I ordered this for my brother. He thinks it is one of the greatest albums of the late 70s. He wore out his vinyl and wanted it on CD.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think this app is one of the best apps I have!! For $6.99, maybe you can lower  the price a bit! *On another note, some new ideas that you could invent is maybe a bomb to blow up things, (like unwanted buildings, etc,) minecraft money (fake money, or something to obtain valuable virtual objects. Keep in mind, that there are some cons to this,) things you can find while uncovering land, (like a jewel or something when you are taking away new land that you haven't before,) maybe another mode that is a survival story and that it adjusts to your answers, (It also adjusts to the moves you make,) and plenty more ideas I have!! Thank you so much for making minecraft!!
B000069HJN|4.0|If combined with the songs from &#34;In The Eye Of The Storm&#34; by Roger Hodgson to make a proper farewell album with the classic lineup. After this, it was downhill for Supertramp.
B003L77GRO|5.0|This is a great series. Every season gets better. Its a very adictive show especially as you get to know the characters.
B006KP3XCQ|3.0|I bought this for a gift for my daughter.  I couldnt even wrap it because the package was completely tore apart.  I took the dvd out and put it in another box for her to open.  I was completely disappointed in the way this package arrived.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|Reading this book took me back to when I was a kid. So many of the things that Charlie was dealing with happened to me.  I wished I had the friends like Charlie had... that is the difference between he and I.<br /><br />What a ride...<br /><br />This book is s tremendous tool to let young people know that they are not alone in the things that they are feeling or experiencing.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|If you like a good suspense, horror movie you will like this one.  It has lots of suspenseful moments.  However, the relationships between some of the characters never really come together very well and there are several loose ends.  But the movie will linger with you like a good horror movie should.  A good movie worth watching if you like these types of movies.  Not gory, more suspenseful with implications of gore.
B000ICZD4I|3.0|Come on folks --- I'm tired of this kind of junk --- you need a  way to simply say I like it or don't --- no need to write a book to justify why I like the item purchased......
B0018RFLQ2|1.0|(Written by Mrs Bogler) Though the idea was promising, this film was simply poor - the dialogue was wooden and you ended up feeling little for the characters, even the boy (we have a son his age, so were ready to like this film). This was an intellectual subject, but the writing was not - it ended up being a cookie cutter, child savant film applied to a new subject area. Too many jarring changes in direction from the main characters interrupted the suspension of disbelief - the father shouting at the boy's teacher for example did not fit with his previous characterisation. Analyse the dialogue to see what we mean - bland at best - nothing to make you feel that the writer had depth or was going to demonstrate depth - just lots of lingering, arty visuals as we have come to expect in more modern times. Ben Kingsley's character was creepy actually as a result of long camera shots and no worthy dialogue to justify the intensity. Not profound and, again, jarring changes of direction for his character -switching from talking about chess as an art in one sentence, to 'you've got to hate your opponent' in another - it just sat all wrong. Unusually for us, we gave up watching, feeling too irritated.
1439127700|5.0|This was an excellent read on the accountability of our Presidents and surprising revelations of their comradeship.<br />I would have liked less verbiage on the verbose President Nixon, however, this being said, I certainly recommend this to every Book Club.......and be prepared for interesting, intellectual discussions.
B0055PMJMW|4.0|Connelly does it again with the three short stories with the Bosch character. They are interesting and it is fun to try to solve the crime before the story ends.  Not always right!

B0063GORYU|5.0|I picked this game because I like Spider Solataire.  I play it everyday.  It is always fun to see if you can win.
B0078ZTWP4|4.0|I would have given the EVER lantern 5 stars if the bottom was easier to assemble as noted in other reviews.  I bought 3 different lanterns, a Coleman twin LED for $40, a Rayovac sportsman LED lantern (SE3DLN) at $23.78 and an EVER LED lantern for $18.50. The EVER and the Rayovac are almost twins physically but the EVER was more difficlt to assemble the bottom although the two go together identically.  None of the three (Coleman included with a difficult to screw on base) went together easily in a lighted room and you would never be able to assemble one by feel alone.  The Coleman put out the most light, the EVER was a little less effective, but surprisingly it did however put out noticably more light than the Rayovac.  However I think all 3 were quite satisfactory in light output.  If I were going to choose among them for emergency lighting I woud buy several EVERs for the price of one Coleman as there wasn't a whole lot of difference in light output and the EVER works on 3 D cells as opposed to 8 in the Coleman.

B004JN1D2I|5.0|As a lover of historical fiction, this set of books wasn't hard to slip into at all. I was interested in reading the series after watching the first season of GoT on TV, and I've got to say, I think I am enjoying the books a bit more!<br />The pace of the story is quick, the tone is very engaging, and it's altogether an exciting and enthralling series.<br />I highly recommend it!!

B0053TMP24|5.0|My 12-year-old is addicted to all of Riordan's books, and this one is no different--she read it voraciously from start to finish. I love these books in general because they have made her so interested in mythology and she has learned more than she would have if I had asked her to study myths! She really follows the journey and gets sucked into all of the characters and their story.<br /><br />We buy all of these books and I think they are perfect for this age group! If you're on the fence, it's worth giving the first books in the different series' a try. She never used to read a lot, and I still can't get her interested in many other types of books, but if I buy her one of Riordan's she has the Kindle to her nose for days!

B00BHU2A7I|4.0|The making of psycho is the basis of this film and is better than the source material. The titular character is played masterfully by Anthony Hopkins. The actor looks and sounds like Hitchcock by his mannerisms and voice inflections. The actor deftly portrays the man as controlling and self-absorbed yet somehow a film making genius. Helen Mirren as his wife shows she was emotionally involved with another man but took her husband to task for being too obsessive with his lead actresses. The couple worked best together as she was an editor of her husbands films and the music of the shower scene was shown to be her idea. Scarlett Johannson as janet leigh was well cast but she should have been seen more involved in the movie. She was what drove the original film. Hardly any time was spent on the acting of Bates and the addition of Hitchcock talking to a ghost of Bein was odd. The film was in limited release so many people did not get to see this. It is worth watching and the scene with Scarlett with hitchcock as he directs the shower scene shows a little of film legendry. The premiere scene is also well done as hitch feels vindicated.
B00BHU9BV6|3.0|This movie that has everything going for it: fine acting, beautiful production/costume design, memorable score, breathtaking cinematography, and inventive direction that takes a familiar tale and retelling it in a wholly unexpected way. Transplanting the action to a sumptuously dilapidated theatre might seem like a hollow gimmick, but in practice leads to a freeling of deeper meaning as well as many a thrilling transition.<br /><br />So who is the weak link for me? Leo Tolstory. My journey through the story started off shakey, but I was kept engaged by gimmicks and the technical bravura that pulled them off. Then, just as the filmmakers started to pull back and let the story, I began to feel for the characters. Then I felt less and less engaged, and before it was even half over, I was fully bored and just wanted it too freaking end.<br /><br />I know Anna Karinina is one of the most acclaimed novels ever, but I should have known that no matter how good the production was, this is not the kind of movie I enjoy. So if you think the same may be true for you, I wouldn't recommend you see this.
B009ANP4F4|5.0|This is a great movie for the dancing, the music and that get up off the sofa or chair have a good time as that's what this film is. Just a fine good time! I've watched it a few times now & the music just grows on one in my opinion.....!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B007M45PMU|1.0|Decided to purchase the album since it was cheap. $3.99. The complete album did not download, only 5 songs downloaded and they were not even the first 5 listed. This was a rip off. I didn't even get the songs I liked from this group.
B00BHMETKC|5.0|Awesome movie one worth watching over and over again. Ben Affleck is just superb in this as an actor and a director.
B007QPFGJW|5.0|I suggest reading the previous novels with Harry Hole as the main character before this one. I hope another book from this author is on the way.
B00B7FWWNA|4.0|A good movie, worth watching, but not the year's best.  The characters were well acted and interesting.  Definitely an adult subject.

B008XBCJ34|5.0|What a great movie. We watched it in 3-D and were blown away. Well worth the money. My only complaint is the packaging, be careful when you try to remove the shrink wrap from the package. I accidently cut into the plastic protective sleeve.
B003O86FMW|5.0|This was definitely a cliff hanger. I would have to force myself to stop reading to get my responsibilities taken care of, I am rereading all the books, and its still capturing.

Star ctossed lovers that get together, are seperated, rinse repeat. Check. Corrupt clergy? Check. Brutal Knight? Check. I could go on and on but I won't. I can't help but feel that Mr Follet took the easy way out by re-cycling the various subplots but not bothering to put the effort into it. Bleah.

B00AREIAI8|4.0|This is my first Kindle Fire app, so I didn't know what to expect.  Overall it has been  entertaining.  Basically you care for your horse like you would in real life with less mess, hassle and it's virtually free.  Some items, for example clothing for your rider, cost real money, so customization isn't cheap.  Other than that it's fun to pet your horse, train it, and put it in shows.  No thinking is involved, and it is basically a game to pass the time.
B00992CF6W|1.0|Have no clue what the purpose of this game is.  The  description of the game is just as vague as my concept of the game.  Not Helpful at all.  Just to make matters worse, the game gives no directions at all.  So my son, who saw this game, or, yet another minecraft game, being played and asked for it, has no clue or direction of how to play the game.  What the objective of the game?  Don't know? They don't really say! It was also a pretty costly game as well, that did not offer a brief try it out, we are stuck just trying to understand how to move around-move around to do what???? In my opinion, a true waste, but, hey, I would be willing to change my rating if someone would be able to tell me what the purpose of the game is and how to play it!
B008OOYALE|3.0|This is a cute game where you hatch some dragons, feed them, and design their habitat.  I don't see me having hours of entertainment with it.  It's just something to check back on to pass the time.  One thing I didn't like is that you have to have access to a wi-fi connection just to access the game.

B003WUYOQ6|5.0|Having been put into menopause surgically 12 years ago, I have been frustrated by my attempts to maintain a healthy weight.  Regardless of the weight loss and exercise programs I have put myself on (all based upon the calories in vs. calories out model), my weight quickly increased 30 pounds, and I have been unable to budge it for all these years.  More worrisome is that my blood sugar has been creeping up as well.  All these diets included 50-60% carbs and low fat as recommended by my doctors.  After reading this book, I have been able to make changes to my diet (low carbs, increased fat) resulting in a loss so far of 6 pounds in 3 weeks.  To many of you that don't have issues with weight this might seem insignificant, but based upon my struggles in the past 12 years I feel it is an amazing accomplishment.  Given the fact that Type II diabetes runs in my family (every single one of my over 50 relatives on my Mother's side of the family has this disease) it is vital I make changes to avoid the same fate.  I am a first time reviewer on Amazon, but felt compelled to write a review as the information in the book is paradigm-shifting.  I hope it makes its way into the hands of every doctor and dietician making well-meaning but I feel misguided recommendations to their patients!

Oh and thank you EL James for everything you let my mind do.
B004AQR24W|3.0|There is not much real acting in this as it is basically a shoot-em up movie.  A bit over the top with the graphic violence parts, I think, and the plot line old and quite shallow.  Won't watch it again.

B009FB3XTA|4.0|Although I already pre-ordered the DVD, I originally saw this movie when it first came out, so I had a little trouble remembering the soundtrack... I admit I was a little apprehensive about ordering it, since I was pretty disappointed by the Part 1 soundtrack, but did so to complete the collection. I loved the movie mind you, but felt there were many \\"filler\\" songs on that soundtrack, and so I found myself wanting for something more like the New Moon soundtrack. I feel I got that with this latest one! I'm not sure if these artists were contracted to write songs especially for this movie, but it sure sounds like it. Anyone who says this soundtrack is too \\"airy\\" (mostly the men I think-LOL!) is undercutting the beauty of the songs written by these artists. Although I really don't know most of the artists on it, I found just about all of the songs to be beautifully performed and fitting the storyline and overall feeling of the film. I don't think anyone should avoid this soundtrack because of one or two \\"fillers,\\" (i.e. the completely inappropriate Green Day track). Buy it because you love the movie, and expect to be reminded of the feelings that the film evoked. It succeeded in doing that for me, as well as entertaining me with some nicely progressive and fulfilling music. I especially like the POP ETC. track \\"Speak Up,\\" and James Vincent McMorrow's haunting (LOL) number, \\"Ghosts.\\" Buy it to complete your collection, and I'm sure you will not regret it.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|A great compilation of songs from one of the greatest musicals ever.  Idina Mendzel and Kristin Chenoweth bring so much life to the characters and really make it believable.
B00A1XIXO6|3.0|I have been a big Bad Religion fan for a long time. That said, I am starting to get less enthused about each new album. When they released The Process of Belief I felt they had updated the formula well, and it made me excited. Then again when The Empire Strikes First came out I thought they found some new sounds that still sounded distinctly Bad Religionesque, but really grew into something different and new. But after that, I felt like the albums have become stale. The lyrics are still very intelligent and worth listening to, but I don't think this album will be one I listen to a lot like I do Process and Empire.
B0098460O4|5.0|I so like this duo. They have such pure voices, and make me tear a little to be one of the first to see them bloom in the years of wonderful music..

0131480057|5.0|This was a really good reference, and helped me study for RHCT/RHCSA. It's also good for when you just need to brush up on the basics of many of the more common software packages that are part of standard distributions.<br /><br />Once you reach the RHCE/high-levels of operations though, you'll find this book collecting dust. But hey, stuff just gets too complex at those levels, so no single book will really ever suffice.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|Awesome action movie. Highly recommend. Would get the separate movies that revolve around each of the superheroes on their own. Definately worth owning
B006LSZECO|1.0|The book was painstakingly detailed until the very disappointing end. A whole lot of build up, a lot of wrongs never made right and no satisfying end.
0345803485|1.0|Holy crap, this is 50 shades of crap-double crap! I had to force myself to read this book. I think that even I could have done a better job at writing this book. There were too much repetition used throughout the book. I got so tired of reading about the protaganist's inner goddes and her subconscious. She rolled her eyes so often I almost became dizzy. I also got tired of reading that Christian's eyes are grey and boy can she flush!<br /><br />I thought this book was boring and I cant figure out what my friends were enjoying in this book. The book took too long to develop and each chapter seemed to have the same cycle of events. All they do is have sex and for a book that is so explicit, why does Anna refer to her vagina as \\"down there\\". I get that she is shy or supposed to be shy but I don't think a shy person gives a man a BJ so quickly after meeting him and orgasms on her first sexual experience. Speaking of orgasm I think Anna is the only person in this world who orgasms on command.I know there are women who orgasms very easily but not because their partner tells them to.<br /><br />If I were the editor I would delete some parts of the book like the contract and the job interview for example as all it does is take up space. These things could be summarised instead. There were too much dialogues which contributes to the boredom - that and the fact that the book was written in the first person narrative. I thought Anna sounded more like a sixteen year old girl and Christian sounded more like about forty years old.<br /><br />I've finished reading book 1 -after skipping a few pages out- but I have no interest in reading the other two, thank God I was told of the option of downloading the book to my laptop rather that purchasing the books.

0062231375|4.0|An insider's look into the world of restaurant chefs, Kitchen Confidential is a blisteringly honest, eminently readable (unless curse words offend you) and ultimately fascinating examination of what goes on in restaurant kitchens.<br /><br />This was the book that put Anthony Bourdain on the map, and I can see why. He has a relatable, honest, profane, bawdy, amusing, intelligent, helpful, opinionated personality and he can write like a dream. His conversational writing style is a treat to read, and his strong personality infuses every page -- just like truffle oil would infuse a ... who am I kidding? I'm not a foodie so I have no idea what truffle oil might infuse. This book was awesome -- filled with gossipy insider scoop, practical information (I know what kind of knife to buy now) and the personal history of one of the most interesting television chefs/personalities out there. Bourdain's adventurousness and \\"why not try everything once\\" attitude may have been hell to live through but it makes a rollicking great memoir. A must read for anyone considering pursuing a career as a chef.

0385344228|4.0|Defending Jacob is a satisfying legal thriller with a few good twists thrown in -- distinguishing it from the scads of other legal thrillers out there.<br /><br />The book opens with our narrator, Andy Barber, on the stand at a grand jury trial. A former district attorney, Barber is under investigation for something, but we're not quite sure what it is. As the book develops, we learn that his son Jacob was accused of murdering a fellow classmate. Convinced of his son's innocence and willing to do whatever it takes to defend him, Andy goes to great lengths to prove Jacob's innocence ... even if it means confronting secrets from his past. The fun of the book is never knowing if Andy is fooling us or himself. Landay does a great job of keeping you guessing throughout and then pitches a few effective curve balls at the end. This would be a great choice for a book club as there are lots of lively discussion topics (the murder gene, how far would you go to defend your child, what is a parent's responsibility if a child does something wrong). The narrator of the audiobook was Grover Gardner, who has a distinctive voice that took some getting used to. However, he did an effective narrating job and \\"became\\" Andy Barber for me.
B00BAYLRNO|5.0|\\"The Impossible\\" is an excellent film about one family's struggle to survive during a tsunami cataclysm that rocked our planet not so long ago. This excellent film sucked me into it's believably realistic and powerful story-line, holding me in my seat until it's satisfying end.<br /><br />FACT: On Sunday, December 26, 2004 at 00:58:53 UTC in the Indian Ocean off the west coast of Sumatra, a sudden megathrust subduction (Earth is the only Planet where subduction is known to occur), undersea earthquake (magnitude 9.1-9.3) released century's of built up energy into the sea floor. This caused a rupture more then 600 miles long, displacing the seafloor above the rupture moving trillions of tons of rock that caused our entire planet to vibrate (shudder) as much as 1 centimeter (0.4 inches), and triggering other earthquakes as far away as Alaska. This displacement then sent enormous seawave swells across the Indian Ocean in every direction to surge onto land (up to 98 feet high), flooding and destroying everything in it's path. Anyone who survived this unexpected attack by mother nature was truly blessed.<br /><br />Spanish director Juan Antonio Bayona has created a masterpiece depicting the plight of a vacationing family of five (two parents and three adolescent boys), caught in one of our recent history's most harrowing catastrophes. This 2012 English-language Spanish disaster drama film is based on the true story (by Maria Belon and the screenplay is penned by Sergio G. Sanchez), of this family who were at the time of this disaster living in Japan and vacationing in Thailand at the time of the tsunami. This film was produced at \\"Ciudad de la Luz\\" Studios (City of Light Studios) in Spain. The terrifying tsunami sequence in this film makes you think and believe you are watching actual documentary footage of the real natural disaster that struck Asia that day killing hundreds of thousands. It's not. Director Boyona and his visual-and special effects supervisors worked on and planned for more than a year on exacting planning/experimentation for the flood scenes. They used a giant water tank in Spain (the largest in Europe) and a sprawling miniature of a beach resort. Then they added location shots in Thailand and some computer wizardry to create 10 minutes of cinematic terror for it's characters and us. The devastation is very realistic looking. Set Designer, Pilar Revuelta has done a brilliant job creating huge areas of devastation that the actors acted in the middle of.<br /><br />Naomi Watts (British/Australian actress known for her role as Ann Darrow-(Beauty) in Peter Jackson's 2005 \\"King Kong\\"), preforms the lead character role \\"Maria\\" who is the mother of three young boy's and wife to husband \\"Henry\\" preformed by Ewan McGregor (Scottish actor known for his role as Lincoln Six Echo/Tom Lincoln, in Michael Mann's 2005 \\"The Island\\"). Her acting is superb. She deserves her Academy Award nomination for Best Actress, and I hope she wins. Naomi Watts spent two weeks in a water tank shooting grueling underwater scenes for this film. She convinced me that what she was going through on screen was totally real. I thought Naomi was going to die! I could almost feel her pain as I watched her character struggle to survive throughout this emotional film. Her performance as the determined, strong and resilient mother, fighting for her own life and that of her son \\"Lucas\\" (preformed by Tom Holland) from death by the huge tidal surge that threatens both of their lives...was amazing. Young actor Tom Holland did an excellent job carrying many scenes in this film.<br /><br />Maria's husband Ewan McGregor's \\"Henry\\", does an excellent character performance depicting his soul wrenching shock, despair, and feelings of hopelessness while struggling to survive in the aftermath of the tsunami. Henry has a cell phone scene that depicts the darker side of human nature that sometimes does occur during this type of stressful event. Two cute little boy actors (Oaklee Pendergast-\\"Simon\\", and Samuel Joslin-\\"Thomas\\"), were adorable and added a much needed levity to this tragic story line. I also enjoyed seeing Geraldine Page (British-American actress known for her role as Tonya in director David Lean's 1965 \\"Doctor Zhivago), as the old woman who gives Lucas a soulful talk about the life and death of stars in the nights sky. This films original score is by Fernando Velazquez and the wonderful Cinematography is expertly handled by Oscar Faura.<br /><br />I hate to use the words \\"entertaining\\" and \\"enjoyable\\" for this film, but they do apply. \\"The Impossible\\" is very good and very well done. I highly recommend this historically based film. Enjoy!<br /><br />Release Date: 4 January 2013<br />Running Time: 114 minutes<br />Rated: PG-13 for intense realistic sequences, including disturbing injury images and brief nudity.<br />Disaster Drama/Thriller<br />Grade: A<br /><br />Historical side note: In 2004 at the time of this tsunami, only the Pacific Ocean had a tsunami warning system. This system of floating buoys called DART, was established in 1949 following the 1946 Aleutian Island Earthquake and the tsunami that resulted in 165 casualties in Hawaii and Alaska. Because of this event, the Indian Ocean Tsunami Warning System was added to the Pacific Ocean Warning System extending it's coverage. It became active in late June 2006 consisting of 25 seismographic stations relaying information to 26 national Tsunami information centers, as well as three deep-ocean sensors.<br /><br />On March 11, 2011 at 14:46:23 UTC, in the Pacific Ocean off the coast of Japan another undersea megathrust subduction (magnitude 9.0) earthquake fractured the sea floor suddenly generating monster seawave swells that inundated Japans sea-level coastline. The Pacific Ocean Warning System did do it's job and is believed to have saved many lives, but this time the epicenter (70 kilometers (43 mi) off shore), was too close to land to be fully effective. Massive wave surges came flooding inland too fast to save everyone. Wave heights were up to 40.5 meters (133 feet) traveling inland 10km (6 miles) destroying everything in it's path. Chillingly this earthquake moved Honshu (the main island of Japan) 2.4m (8 feet) east and shifted the earth on it's axis by estimates of between 10cm (4 inches) and 25cm (10 inches).<br /><br />The final death toll for the Indian Ocean Tsunami was a staggering 283,000. The death toll for 2011 Tohoku earthquake and tsunami was much less at 15,878, but had thousands injured or missing.

0385535147|2.0|I'd read a few reviews that said that The Racketeer was John Grisham's return to his glory days (i.e., The Firm). I would have to respectfully disagree.<br /><br />First off, when an author brags at the end how no research was done and he just made everything up, I have to give one strike. Add in a plot that felt nonsensical, unrealistic and implausible and you've got two strikes. Pile on boring, bland writing and you've got three strikes. I slogged through this audio (using one of my precious Audible credits) because I kept waiting to see if things were going to get better. They did not.<br />J.D. Jackson did a fine job narrating but he couldn't save the material.<br /><br />Unless you are a die-hard Grisham fan, I'd skip this one. I wish I had.

B004L9MFM2|4.0|First of all, I've changed my mind now about reading the books after watching the TV series. Initially, I thought it would be more fun to not spoil the surprises and events of the TV, through reading the books, but now I think there is just too much downside. There is quite a lot of detail left out of the TV series, and in some cases they've really simplified what was going on; in particular at the end of the TV series I was plain confused as to why the place was on fire. After reading, I now know, and have a much better idea. Further, I think I'll actually enjoy the TV more for knowing what the full story is, and just going for the ride. Also, I felt I had to wade through the book a little as I basically knew what was going on more than the author intended, so I think it was a little spoiled from that point of view.<br />Ah well. I now continue straight into A Storm of Swords before the new TV season starts in April.<br />As for the actual novel, other than the above, I did really enjoy it. The language is beautiful, the detail amazing, and the depth fulfilling. Tyrion shines in the book as he does on TV. Actually, I felt inspired to write something myself, I think its the language that gets me into an expansive and creative mood. No good can come of this.<br /><br />[...]

B004P1JEWU|5.0|I found I enjoyed reading this more than the previous two in the series. Most obviously because I had not seen the TV series, and had no idea what was going to happen. This gives all the reveals and twists their full horrifying or fantastic impact. This is the real beauty of Martin's work, in that just because you have built up a strong empathy with or appreciation for, or even massive hatred of a given character, it has no bearing on their longevity or fate. You read with really no idea what will happen, which is sadly missing from many novels which you read really to find out how the end is achieved, knowing really where it is going most of the time.<br />The language and detail remains impressive and beautiful. The dedication to character building regardless of fate likewise.<br />Part two in particular is filled with OMFG moments and was so much fun to read.<br /><br />[...]

B005J2V74C|3.0|I'd already seen this, on TV sometime. It's good enough to keep watching but that's about it. It's kind a like watching the Big Foot Hunters, you know how it's going to end but still watch it anyway

B00AECDDYY|4.0|Good strategy game. Graphics are ok nothing to write home about but the gameplay itself is wonderful. Simple but addicting. Got this on sale for .99c . It's certainly worth that not sure about the previous price of 2.99 though.

B003UBTX6S|5.0|Great second book in the series. I couldn't believe what Lena had done. I thought for sure I was not going to like her anymore especially because she did everything to push poor Ethan away. But like the true southern gentleman he is he could not and would not give up on Lena even though I wanted him to sometimes. Going on this crazy journey with Ethan, Link and Liz was so much fun. I was really hoping for some more chemistry between Ethan and Liz. I really like her and think she is a perfect match for Ethan. But he loves Lena too much. Of course this wouldn't be much of a story if he didn't. Great twist and turns and more secrets that await discovery.

B0083GQKQG|3.0|'We Need To Talk About Kevin' is definitely a good movie. If you're someone who struggles with ADD, you best watch this a few times as it could be hard from time to time to distinguish what's happening when as there's a lot of flashbacks. Overall, the climax builds and doesn't disappoint. I rated 3/5 starts specifically due to that it can be hard to keep up with the pace of the movie. Not a family oriented movie in the least, but definitely a good movie to watch once the kids have gone to bed!

B0011UJMK2|4.0|After beginning this book, I thought about not continuing to read it because in was depressing. I continued to read it & found it was giving me insight into how bad life in Commist Russia must have been. It would be hard to have to live in such fear & oppression. It was good to read how one man was able to rise above this & improve things in a small way. The unusual twist near the end of the story was added much to the story.<br /><br />At first I did not think I would read any more of the books in the trilogy but am now reconsidering my position on them. Depending on their price & my time, I may read the other two books.
B005IQZB14|4.0|I am considering a MUCH shorter through hike and this book was recommended to me.  It is a good story and gave me some ideas that I may have neglected before.

B003TSEEDY|5.0|No way can I put my thoughts on this book into one little box. Relatable. Insightful. And as I read it I saw the main character change, and along the way I saw myself change as well.

If you use the IS, give it time to run before snapping a picture. Besides that, this lens is tack sharp with exact focus.

B008MG1E4A|4.0|Definitely worth reading. The number of acronyms will make your head spin, but the book was a page turner. I would have liked to see the writing style embellished; i.e. with more descriptive prose, not just commentary on the length and condition of the hairstyles of Mr. Owen's compatriots. It reads like someone is fitting the book to a somewhat rigid format of content. However, as this is likely Mr. Owen's first attempt, it is obviously a huge success and accomplishment.<br />After seeing 'zero dark thirty'  (more fictional), this was a nice read and I tried to recall which member of the UBL mission might have been Mark.<br />Highly recommended.

B001NOQI3U|5.0|Yentl, based on a story by the renowned Jewish writer, Isaac Bashevis Singer, brings us Barbara Streisand at her musical and acting best.  Directed by her, it is a story of a woman's desire to be a scholar in a world that accepts only a woman as homemaker.  Yentl decides to take on a man's personna so that she can study Torah (biblical law and history) in a Yeshiva (Jewish school for scholarship).  However, her developing feelings of love for another student increasingly complicates her becoming a scholar in a male dominated world.  To be sure, one has to appreciate Streisand's style of pre-rock singing to enjoy this film.  But, what is not to like?
B004SBS8LA|5.0|Loved the game from the beginning.  Fast game, fun watching the birds and seeing how good one can play the game.
B000I14UTS|5.0|I usually prefer a live play, but this one is an exception.  Cabaret the film is frighteningly exciting.  While it explores and develops personal human relationships in all their complexities, it also gives us a taste of the coming Nazi atrocities.  This is a musical but not really a musical comedy.  There may be some humor - most things in life have some - but the music drives a story that is carrying the world to an awful conflict.  Joel Gray as the narrator and Liza Minelli as Sally are subperb as they perform at the height of their artistic skills.
B009ZQHQ84|4.0|Teacher character, played by Adrien Brody, is not the typical one seen in these types of story.  In general I like these inner-city-schools type movies and this one pleasantly surprised with an original perspective.  Recommend,
B001ANSSDC|1.0|This was ridiculously written, sophomoric and just plain boring. I had high hopes this would be an entertaining read. No such luck.
B0030B621W|3.0|This movie had great reviews on many websites but it was just kinda slow and dull for me.  Not horrible as I did watch it all the way through, but not great either.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|Brillant and heart wrenching. The twists and turns seem to come out of nowhere, but fill the plot with a page turning story until the very end. Loved it!
B00B0ZT9NI|2.0|Story wasn't really very interesting or exciting.  If  you read the preview you pretty much get it all.  Really do not understand why everyone thinks it is so great or worthy of Best Picture nomination.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This game is perfect for me I love cute little animals. It's. so fun! I play it all the time it never gets boring.It is a cute creative game. My whole family loved it. The little green monster  that you feed candy in the game is the cutest thing I ever saw!Cut the rope is great for the whole family!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|Enjoyed the other two books - it seems like #3 of any book or movie seems to leave you dissappointed.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|Good story and nice twist at the end.  I have to say that I liked the book a lot more than the movie.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Great acting, great production values, powerful story. Every male needs this for encouragement, and the challenge it presents. One of our favorite movies ever.
B00BESM14U|5.0|This movie was captivating and very well done. It is not a light movie, but quite excellent and I highly recommended it.
0316224588|4.0|Rebus is still his own man, and his own worst enemy, and a man who hurtles back and forth across the line that separates &#34;correct&#34; and &#34;moral&#34; behavior, and that which gets the job done and achieves justice, although not always the type the system approves of. Great setting and interplay between Rebus and Siobhan.<br />4.5 stars, actually, because I longed to have a few threads tied up.
0061649694|5.0|I purchased this product for a christmas gift and arrived ontime and packaged very well from the shipper. The company i purchased this movie from was cheaper than any other company i check out for this movie.
B00BB8RKH6|5.0|Denzel Washington is an American treasure and was great in this movie. The sex scenes were totally unnecessary to the story, we know he was morally corrupt but that is Hollywood. Just be aware that there is nudity if you sit down to watch as a family. I was embarrassed on the Amtrak that someone would see me watching this otherwise great movie.
630522577X|5.0|Bought this as christmas present for my Dad I purchased it on short notice and the company shipped it out quit and without hassle. plus shipped it with care like i was family. thankyou again
B008JGSM6G|5.0|To me this is a great strategy game because it involves a lot of thinking.  this is the best game!
B00BETX5PS|3.0|Would have been better if I didn't have to keep restarting it would just stop playing and would not resume from where it stopped would have to start from beginning took about 4 hours to watch 2 hour movie.
B00AE9UYJ4|5.0|my face was beat red when I was playing wand right when I got the second page he was teleporting right in front of me.  but I did get 7/8 pages first try j couldn't get the last page because he was guarding it so I went right in front of him and I died
B009O2XY12|1.0|i don't like it at all...I wanted Bubble Witch and this came up...not funto childish for me&#62; i can't get the witches on my Kindle :(
B005COO1X6|5.0|I would recommend this to all age groups. It kept you wanting to never put it down! Another great story!
B007N8RULO|5.0|it is so much fun and it makes me concentrate on what I am doing...so I get my mind off the things around me
B008Z9L94O|2.0|It{s an interesenting product, the design on the contents, very nice.<br />But it does not sounds well, and seems to be in a different tempo.<br />Too expensive maybe.
0525952926|3.0|Very good book but graphic sex overdone, detracting from human relationships.The book was easy to read, hard to put down but the graphic sex disturbed me.
1907590331|4.0|This is one of these books that are on what I call the \\"Moby D\\" list.There are book and movies that you have to read  and or see so that you can be a well rounded individual. At least in theory. I plan to make another list of books that everyone should read before they die. This is one of them so hop to it. Insightful and endearing and a easy read for a young adult. Great character studies.
B008AK8FHM|3.0|A bit technical for my needs at this time.  I am glad a man of very technical study in medicine has now a grasp on the God who is in control.  Hopefully his collegues, especially in neurosurgery will read this and adjust their God complex
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Or of course you can cheat and watch the movie but the book is better than the movie. Wonderfully written,epic and moving Hugo has written an interesting piece of intersecting lives. Innocence, shame , obsession,romance and redemption, this book has it all . This book goes down on my \\"Moby D\\" list that will be coming shortly.
B005IQZB14|4.0|Crazy and fun read.  Truly amazing; I learned so much about an area I probably will never be able to see.  Thanks.  I connected to this as I too lived in Duluth, MN for several years while growing up.
B00BB8RKH6|2.0|This Denzel fan is disappointed. Had to shut it off. Was not going to wade through a sewer of filthy language, too much skin and the Lord's name slung around to find any acting gems. When will Hollywood get it that a lot of us are worn out by this?.
B004GXZ69W|5.0|I have arthritis in my hand and wrist, and some carpal tunnel syndrome, and I am on the computer a lot, so I wanted to see if this type of mouse would help decrease the pain.  The different hand position helps a lot!  And the mouse is really comfortable to touch. I use a wrist pad with it to elevate my hand to the right height. Very happy with this product!  (The instructions sounded really complicated, but I didn't have to go through all that - just plugged it into the USB port, and it was ready to go.)
B008DYZKQE|4.0|I read the Paper bag princess (by Robert Munsch and illustrated by Michael Martchenko)  when I was DD's age and loved it. I instantly recalled the pictures of the sleepy looking dragon when I heard the title again. Princess Elizabeth is to be married to a pompous Prince when he is kidnapped by a dragon. With a twist on the usual Fairy tale, it is the Princess who sets off to rescue the Prince. Elizabeth is one smart spunky girl who isn't going to let anyone else determine her happily ever after. This is definitely a modern classic and I was thrilled when my own girls liked it as much as I did `back in the day'.<br />The messages the book sends:<br /><br />  Girls aren't any less powerful or resourceful than boys.<br />  Happily ever after isn't like the movies!<br />  If someone treats you badly you don't have to stick around and put up with it.<br /><br />Netgalley sent me a digital copy of this book of the in return for an honest review<br />I will not receive any monetary compensation from Netgalley or the book's publisher
B007URVZJ6|5.0|Very helpful in formatting an ebook for KDP.  This provides a great reference which helps in setting up your ebook format at the beginning as you are writing your book so that you don't have to reformat.
B0051UP5NQ|3.0|I'd like buying it better if I did not have to pay for using it too. Too bad I'm double dipped.
0064430170|5.0|As the mother of four and a former child development teacher, I can verify that children love this book. The story and pictures are simple, but children truly enjoy them. I read this story daily to my children and students, and they always sat still and listened. If you don't own GOODNIGHT MOON, you must buy it! It is a classic and will be much loved.
B00APUYN0I|5.0|Love this movie and can't stop watching it.  Main actress is really good, even though it might seem a silly, chick flick type movie.  Musical numbers are fabulous and geared towards today's younger generation.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|This track is absolutely awesome! Mariah manages to keep herself relevant over and over again. The vocals on this track are out of this world and the song has a great vibe to it. This should definitely be her 19th #1!!
B00992CF6W|5.0|This game is AMAZING, fun, great, and awesome. You can spend hours on it building away. I made a city, a cool town and an amazing hotel on creative mode. On survival mode I went to the nether and built an arcade out of it. The best part about this app is that you do not need WiFi.<br /> There you are Steve, the great fighting for survival in a world of danger. You have to battle of skeletons,  creepers, and zombies while gathering resources to build your house. I would suggest you collect wood first then mine into a mountain to make it your safe house. Then, you can gather wool, and other resources  to make your house.<br />  If you have the kindle fire I would suggest that you get pocket editor pro. You  can get the free version but it doesn't do have the stuff that the pro does. You can span mobs of stuff, you can get yourself diamond, wool, cameras, compasses, and much MUCH more!<br />  Get this  app you will not regret it.
B000PMLFRA|5.0|Very satisfied, got it in 5 days great picture sound excellent recommend to all! You need to get this if you never seen it on blu-ray its awesome will blow you away if you like the trilogy. Way better than the old versions don't listen to the fans of the non-special editions they are not even close to being as good as this way better than the original!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|The games are almost to fast to play four cards. I am sure the seasoned player will have no problems. I am still trying to figure out all the bells and whistles.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|This book was good. It took a few chapters for the sweet wish-i-had-that-in-high-school romance to kick in. then it mellowed out and then got really interesting and then your like &#34;ohhh ok... Yea that makes sense&#34;. Then happy ending :D
0765325950|2.0|I've read the whole series a couple of times up to book 10. What I loved about the series was the detail and actual unison of this awesome story throughout the books, very little margin of error happened that made me feel like these characters were real people. The unexpected turn of events, the details and roles every person played. But I have to say that Memory of Light was just a disappointment. I congratulate Sanderson of working on finishing the books and he did a good job on book 12 and book 13, but I have to say Book 14 was like &#34;Let's just get this done&#34;. I just feel like this isn't the same Wheel of time I've been reading in this last book, and it's like some alternative universe story that's been written with different characters and different plots, that being said I'm so sad that it had to end this way. I just hope that this is how Robert Jordan wanted or designed how the series ended, and it's not Sanderson's own ending, and that he just executed it badly.
B004SEUJAA|3.0|If you're like me and you have the old format DVD Collector's Edition of Master and Commander: Far Side of the World and you want to upgrade to the HD version...DON'T BUY THIS BLU-RAY!!! Even though the box art is identical (save for the blue stripe at the top) these two products do not contain the same content. All the extra discs of Behind-The-Scenes featurettes and extra commentary tracks do no exist on this Blu-Ray. Here again, is the tragedy of the HD age, as more and more content is available online to stream (Amazon, Netflix, iTunes, etc,) the studios are putting less and less effort into the home video editions of their films. The truth is that there is no equevelent for the ease of access to the entire content of the Collector's Edition these days and its very likely that they'll never make a Blu-ray version of it. At a glance this seems to be the same product only better, but you'll be very disappointed if you do get his one, trust me.
B008XCM18Q|5.0|I liked it since it paralleled what might have happened in Viet Nam for the intelligence service and those who were involved. Although some events were inplausible, there were enough plausible events and actions that made me dismiss a small amount of shortcomings.
B003TSEEDY|5.0|I read this book for the first time as a high school freshman. 13 years later it still rings true. It captures all the jumbled thoughts and razor sharp emotions of the teen years, while simultaneously giving a poignant voice to those sensitive souls who too often go unnoticed or worse, become ridiculed loners. I am always grateful to find a piece of literature that rings as true as this one. Well worth reading and passing along.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I enjoyed reading Steve Jobs. In many ways, he was a child of the new age. The fact that he was given up as a baby left a deep psychological scar which took many decades to heal. Probably, it never healed. He was a genius in many ways but one thing stuck in my mind that he pursued the perfection in his products: no compromise. This uncompromising stance led to many frictions with his first wife and his emplyees. One thing comes through is uncoditional love his adopted parents; the Jobs.
B00BGD07KS|5.0|Wow, Mariah may have a good comeback after three years of inactivity. This was really powerful! This song and the sound it gives is really, cinematic! Fits the movie very well!
B002TJLEY6|5.0|A lot of new insight of the brain - revealed in a easy manner - and highly recommended to any person working with the brain.
B005RUUUAI|5.0|What can I say?  It's the greatest show on Earth.  I hadn't seen it prior to the 3rd season.  So I downloaded the 1st 2nd and 3rd seasons.  Love it!  I love that the Kindle can show movies and TV shows.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Engaging and endearing!  Maggie Smith is wonderfull and witty!<br />This season will make you laugh and cry.<br />Very suspensefull season!
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|I loved it!  This was my first game of this kind and I had a good time with it.  It took some time to catch on but I found it was a pleasant way to pass time.
B000AM2L1O|5.0|This was a gift for my niece, and was her first doll. It has the nicest face I have been able to find in stores and online, and the soft body was what I was looking for. My niece and my sister liked the doll a lot, and she smells lightly of a pretty scent. Good first doll.
B00BGDF1FO|5.0|Sound quality for these tracks is fantastic. After playing Metal Gear Rising Revengeance, I was definitely wanting to pick up the soundtrack. The price for the amount of music you get was too good to pass up. Definitely glad I snagged this.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|While reading the first chapter i had thought that the storyline might be to young for my tastes. I soon after realized the depth of the characters and was left needing more & more as I quickly devoured the rest of the book. Heartbreaking, touching, lovely, etc. Definitely one to read.
B000JRYOPG|4.0|great movie,, if you are into gangsta movies this is somthing u have to see,, one of my favorites, buy it!!!
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|LOVE the movie so of course I would get the Blue Ray.This is how all Superheroes movies should be made.Got it at Amazon for a great price and fast service.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|I loved book 1 of the trilogy and book 2 is just as good. I like following the same families through all the generatopns.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|Good app. No issues. Mahjong is funny to play. Passes the time. I don't have anything bad to say about this app
B00AEFY3DQ|5.0|Why does it say that it has no features when it so obvioulsy says on the back of the cover it has? There's deleted scenes,featurettes and basically the same as the dvd. This is just laziness from Amazon. And sorry if this has already been mentioned. I was just curious if the item pictured is not the item you get.<br /><br />LOVE the movie though! Best Star Trek movie ever made,LOL!<br /><br />John-Robin!
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|love this app, cleans out your cache and files.  seems to run faster after i use it. would tell everyone about this app
B002BBJ52U|1.0|It was just a downer movie! I didn't like the character development. The whole message was very negative. we didn't like it, can't you tell yet?
B008HK3XOU|3.0|i loved the color and it looked nice. it stands the kindle fire up and it stayed up. it doesnt protect if you drop it. i dont like the way its set up, you have to open the case to plug in the battery charger.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|I had a difficult time putting this book down.  It had an interesting plot and  characters who intrigued me without my guessing the ending.
B00AMBLXP8|2.0|This movie had way too much foul language in it. The plot was ok but I didn't enjoy it due to the language.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have not read many Stepen King's books over the years not be a big fan of horror but this is one folks who love what if alternate history story should not miss.
B005ISQ7JM|3.0|Leitura simples e rápida, aconselhável para quem pretende trabalhar de alguma forma com HTML5, mas vale lembrar que o &#34;livro&#34; (parece mais artigo) não ensina como utilizar. Ter um conhecimento prévio em HTML e desenvolvimento web ajuda no entendimento.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|Pedergast is still a good character but he is starting to get a little tired.  Cabinet of Curisities is still the best book in this series.  Perhaps a new story line.  I don't if his new sons really count.  But please no more Gideon Crew.
B005JLN9ZI|5.0|If your a drake fan you will definitely appreciate this album. Its has everything you expect from drake and more.
B0076DELIG|5.0|Another great read from Mr Connelly. Keep Harry Bosch coming. . . . . . . . . . .
B009KHDT0C|3.0|It was an ok movie nothing spectacular. There were some funny moments here and there, its a decent watch. I would watch again just not very soon.
B00846F1YW|4.0|A nice littlebhidden object game. Able to pinch and zoom on most screens. Zoom doesn't work on the spot the differences scenes.  Also when you touch your screen to drag it counts as a tap, so I end up getting a penalty for random taps when I am just trying to move my screen around. Over all its a nice little game.
B00127RAJY|5.0|Excellent workout for the time and space challenged.  27 mins of non stop action from warm up through cool down.
B0024FADDI|5.0|Nothing WAY outside of the original version but shows the alternate ending & some extremely cool behind the scenes stuff. Everything's mastered very well. Looks great. Laughed my ass off every bit as much as I did in the theater back in the day. Actually, this is the 2nd copy I had to order. The 1st; while new, was terrible. It was just a really bad copy from the factory. But Amazon made things right & exchanged it FAST.
B00ATDOVNK|4.0|I love the graphics and the storyline. Cant wait to finish and play another g5game. Have only played these kind so far and I'm very pleased
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Great download. Lots of fun games to choose from. They're always doing promos or discounts of some sort. You get points for just playing every day!
B00A4Y9BT8|4.0|At the time of this review, this mp3 album was priced at 2.99. I thought this was a great price for this large collection of nostalgic Rage.
B0027MJU00|4.0|I felt the book kept you interested.  I enjoy a good mystery/suspense novel. The twist at the end definitely made the read worthwhile.
B0007KLH1Y|5.0|Everyone in the family loves these - from 4 years to 43 years. I will definately be adding to this set in the future.
B0000C9JCM|5.0|This CD has a wealth of variations of Canon in D. I am very pleased with this purchase - it was well worth the money.
B00BESM14U|4.0|Thespacebaronmylap top doesnt seem to work as well as i was expecting. maybe Ishould send it back. QQ QQ QQ
B006RXQ8RI|5.0|Quentin Tarantino never fails to combine a great plot line with a genius mix of serious and comical dialog. The ending product of all his movies are the same: genius script, great storytelling, and an utterly irresistible film that entertains the eyes, mind, and soul. These aspects, combined with the stylized violence of Kill Bill make for an irresistible film. Highly recommended.
B003UBTX6S|4.0|Beautiful Darkness picked up right where Beautiful Creatures left off. Ethan finds Lena pulling away from him and he cannot figure out why. Ethan definitely has a stubborn streak, though, because he does not give up until he finds out what is going on with her.<br /><br />I really love Ethan and Lena, though we do not really get too much of Lena in this book. We do, however, get a whole lot more of Link, who I absolutely adore. Everyone needs a friend like Link. He's just awesome. We also get to know many of the characters we were briefly introduced to in Beautiful Creatures and also have a couple of new people in this book. Once again, I loved the writing style and descriptiveness the author uses. It was detail oriented and beautifully written.<br /><br />I listened to the audio of this one. The narration was done very well. I really liked the voice of Kevin Collins for Ethan. I also really enjoyed that we got music with the songs, though it was a bit creepy. That's something you could not get from reading the book.
B004ZRV3AU|3.0|I could cut the bottom of a bottle, but not the top or the top and not the bottom. It was a little clumsy
B002OT731E|1.0|When this cd came out in 1995 (I really like it a lot) it had a cd-rom. With new computers I cannot see it any more. You are selling this cd as enhanced and I thought I could see in this new edition the cd-rom again. This cd is not enhanced. If anybody is buying it for the above reasons do not do it. José Jacoviello.
B0091REZMW|4.0|There have been some reviews that criticize the length of quests and amount of money you have to shell out. At, first the lengths of quests are short, but as you play longer, the amount of objects you need to find and different rooms available increases. I have not spent a dime on this game and it is one of my favorites. The one thing that I find frustrating, and why I took off a star, is you have limited energy that has to build up over time. So that means I can't play as often as I would like. All in all, it is a fun game. It has enough missions to keep you occupied, and enough rooms to look in, to give you variety.
B003JTHXOK|5.0|I could not put this book down. I loved it. The plot the ending, everything. I am now a Nicholas Sparks fan, and will be reading more of his books.
B008XKSW7M|1.0|I cant get this movie to play so I have not seen it. It just shows its loading but never plays. Grrrr
B0031RAOVY|1.0|This movie while well made and well acted will leave you feeling numb and depressed if you have any love of animals. Based upon a true story, it is both heart-wrenching and absorbing. Yes, there is a bond between Richard Gere's character and Hachi and his love for the dog is genuine. But overshadowing this bond is the inhumanity of the wife, daughter and son-in-law, he leaves behind after death. To watch that poor dog deteriorate while all the while waiting for his master to return (which can never happen) is very sad. And for the family to allow this to happen is beyond my ability to comprehend. Now, some will say that it was the dog's wishes to wait for his master. But a dog has no understanding of the death of his master. That dog should have been taken in and cared for by someone, anyone and I kept hoping that a kind heated person would intervene. When a stray cat gave birth under my shed, I took the kittens and saw that they got good homes. The mother cat looked for them and it was obvious that she wanted them to live their lives with her as strays. But a cat, like a dog such a Hachi can not be expected to understand the nature of life. Even humans fail to do so at times. It saddened me to have to take the kittens away.  But it would have saddened me more if I found them mauled by a roving dog or hit by a car. What I am trying to say is that an animal needs human guidance and respecting Hachi's wishes to sit by a train station for someone who will never arrive for many years is irresponsible at best. This movie should not be seen by children and frnkly despite the acting, I regret having viewed it.
1881273989|5.0|I previously read The Five Love Languages: How to Express Heartfelt Commitment to your Mate which was an informative read for those who are already in a relationship. The Five Love Languages for Singles sheds light on what singles who are dating or trying to date need to know to be successful. The information is design to help singles express love in a more appropriate and meaningful way that can lead to a meaningful long term relationship. Relationships are something we all want/need whether it's in the form of friendships or romanance. I was curious about what Gary Chapman had to say in this book for singles. I found it helpful and have since passed it on to another curious single.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Well written, kept my attention beginning to end.  This story transports you on time and makes you start to wonder about your own family and ancestors.  In fact, I need to go call my mom....
B0098XY5VK|1.0|Horrible Horrible Horrible Not worth the time or energy. Save yourself the trouble and don't waste your time on this bad version of a game
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome I can't even tell you how good it is but it is better playing it with my brother.<br />HI
B00AHG9KYE|4.0|As an avid reader of Sci-fi for over 45 years, I have always looked forward to Mr. Clarke's work.  I was not disappointed in my recent foray.  It was quite interesting to r e ad about even more things waiting to move from dream status to reality, even if some of those things  come with a Heinlein nod.
B003A97PV0|5.0|Having heard the name for years and dismissing it as nutter rock, I only recently heard their new single &#34;Black Chandeliers&#34; on British radio; why haven't I embraced this band before now?! Bought this album and immediately fell under their spell. Tight, hooky, messy, sharp, pulsing, a great sense of wordplay and a sense of humor, this band should be the center of your life right now. Go ahead and get &#34;Puzzles&#34; first so you can appreciate the progression in their songwriting. Yes, a lot of earlier fans think they've gone too AOR or mainstream with this release, but if those fans decide to forsake Biffy, I'll gladly embrace the band in their place.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|GREAT BOOK...Chris Kyle was truly a AMERICAN HERO and will be missed by his friend...family...and a grateful nation. Fair Winds and Following Seas...Shipmate
1250006341|5.0|This book was a really fun read. It was great to read some of the historical background of the show, as well as, see into some aspects of the filming behind-the-scenes. The quotes from the actors were a great addition.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|I love playing this game. I play it almost everyday!  a friend of mine recommenced it and I love it.<br />Thanks vestap1970@yahoo.com
B003ASLJQS|5.0|Great movie. Good directing and acting. It is not a movie for children. It keeps the viewer in suspense throughout the whole movie.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|This is a great action and mythical mmo game especially for people/kids who like fantasy.it is also a great way to play with friends online
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Pretty GoodJames Bond action flick. It didn't have a very elaborate plot, but enough to give all the action a vehicle.
B0094KF4WG|5.0|This book allows you to see behind the scenes of a highly skilled team without any gore.It is amazing to learn about the process these people go through for the love of their country.
B0091REZMW|3.0|Has a lot of quests for free, unlike some other hidden objects game, but some quests request to use diamonds. Not free for long
B002VWNICW|5.0|This is not the most faithful adaptation of Jane Austen's book, but it is one of my favorites. I think it does a very good job of keeping to the main themes and events of a beloved book while still restricting itself to a feature movie length. In fact, I didn't really miss anything that was cut out, though it does seem to speed through time rather quickly.<br /><br />All of the Bennetts were cast well. Keira Knightley as Elizabeth Bennett is quite good. I felt she captured the right personality and mannerisms. Matthew Macfadyen is very good as Darcy as well. Loved Bingley and Jane, too. The music, scenery, lighting is all done well. Excellent version - definitely worth purchasing.
B009U9S6FI|5.0|Viktor Frankl's story is amazing and deeply touching. The book is a very important book to read - and own!
B00BB8RKH6|1.0|Mainly, I ordered this movie because I admire Denzel Washington, also because the story was meant to be about an expert pilot who was charged with FUI, in spite of having saved many lives during a spectacular plane crash.  This film was a huge disappointment from the very first scene, until I finally gave up watching in the hope that the character, never mind the film, would rise above itself.  I'm shocked that DW would even consider being involved in a film this low. Any more roles like this from Denzel and I'll give up on him too. These days, we need more heroes in our films and fewer reprobates.
B0060CTLOI|4.0|it is very good movie. danny devito is very funny actor voice half goat man in this movie. ok. bye.
B009ZQ8FQG|4.0|I thoroughly enjoy watching the relationships between the servants and the main family. I do get a bit disappointed when a story of a character begins to grow interesting but then is dropped to leave me wondering what is happening wth that character. I was taken completely by surprised by this season's ending ( I won't mention it here since I don't want to spoil it for anyone who has yet to view this third season). I can't imagine the show without this character but then again it will keep me intrigue until the new season begins.
B00B2V66VS|5.0|Nice game I would like it even more if it had all the character's and powerup's and temple's and wallpapers
B006M4RN3U|4.0|Great service and product. Received on time and packaged well. CD was as advertised new.<br />Love the songs. Sounds great.
B00B2V66VS|2.0|It seems that every time I charge my kindle this app wont open. In order to fix this I have to uninstall the app. by doing this I lose all my progress and have to start all over. Great game but it sucks when this happens. Please fix this!!
B00B7G3NFU|4.0|John Hawkes is probably one of our best kept secrets as far as actors go.  He played this part superbly. William H. Macy as the priest - perfect!  The nude scenes were tastefully done. This gave my heart a real tug and I highly recommend it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|You definitely have to read the whole series.  The ending makes you long for the next book.  I think the books are well written with a lot of description.  You can really picture being there.  I have heard a lot of youngsters reading these.  I think in a way they would be good, as long as the parent also reads to discuss with your child.  I could picture some of my young family members reading this, but not others.  It has a lot of violence in it, which could be difficult for some children to deal with.  I personally would only let my teens read this, not any younger.
B0083P1QUM|3.0|Not one that kept me up all night turning pages. More if a read a bit, put down and come back later. Yet still it's Kay Scarpetta and you do come back later and have to finish.

0316066524|5.0|My parents ordered this book and had it shipped to me during a recent 9 month sentence at county jail for drug trafficking. Wow. When my mother told me she was sending me a book about recovery, this was NOT what I expected. I was thinking, &#34;yeah, great mom. I get it, it's time to clean up, send me some recovery literature that's gonna be full of all the blah blah blah I've heard at a million NA meetings and counseling sessions. Whatever, it'll pass some time...&#34; but what I got was an amazing gift that I could totally &#34;identify&#34; with. I've never seen the inner workings of an addicts mind described so fluently. In describing the thought processes of some of the Ennet House residents he pinpointed thoughts and feelings I didn't even know I'd been experiencing until I saw them in print. In writing letters to my friends on the outside who were having relapse/recovery issues I'd constantly be referencing quotations and concepts from this book (when the Fun falls off the Too Much...), and would eventually just get to the point of &#34;look, you really just need to get a copy of Infinite Jest, it's all there....&#34; I got far more out of this book than I got out of every meeting and counseling session I ever went to combined. AND it's just really FUN to read! I love reading, and even in my addiction on the outside before jail I read a couple hours every day, so getting a book that was so well written was a blessing, and one that lasted me nearly a whole week of reading 10 hours a day (not much else to do on the inside...), well it was the best week of my sentence. The girls in my pod couldn't even talk to me while I had it (&#34;Leave me alone, I'm busy. I'll play cribbage with you NEXT week&#34;), I was totally engrossed in the world of Infinite Jest. It's just plain good writing and even someone who isn't an addict will love it, but it's absolutely essential for anyone with substance abuse issues.

B003B02O7I|5.0|John Grisham has done it again.  This book has a great story line, well developed characters, plenty of suspense.  A real page turner.
B006FO3ERQ|3.0|Canada is okay.  Not a great or gripping story, but a well-told story with the emphasis on character and detail over plot.  Ford exams a young boy's life-changing experiences of a single year;  in the end, he seems to have been the only character to have emerged with a strong sense of self, in spite of all that he was asked to absorb at 15.  It's a quiet book, with quirky characters that are not often likeable and even sometimes disturbing.  But as Del says, &#34;Well, that's okay.&#34;
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|I recently bought this mouse. I have not been able to thoroughly test it yet, but here are my initial thoughts.<br /><br />Pros:<br />-Large size fits my hand very nicely. Shape is ideal for how I hold mice. (I am a palm position gamer.)<br />-DPI settings are highly adjustable, allowing for rapid movement, or high precision.<br />-High hertz settings cause nearly instant reaction times, making selecting individual units or sniping much  easier.<br />-Buttons click very easily, but still make a nice audible click.<br />-Highly programmable buttons are very useful in a number of games.<br />-Visually appealing.<br />-Braided cord is fancy.<br /><br />Cons:<br />-Only two profiles can be active, and no way to save them for multiple games, that I know of. Really not a problem most of the time.<br />-Weight, while it seems sufficient with the weights, could use a slightly wider range, so I could try out higher weights.<br /><br />So, as you can see, lots of pro's, very nit picky cons. It really seems like they went through all gaming mice they could find, picked out what people liked and put them in one mouse. Well done Anker.
B009VB7QQA|1.0|Rented this because the bf wanted to see it, and I thought maybe it was going to be a little irreverent and self-deprecating because come on, Abraham Lincoln is a vampire hunter, y'all. But no, the movie played it entirely seriously. But, on the other hand, I can also appreciate movies that are so bad they're good. This movie unfortunately isn't one of them. It's just plain bad.
B00APUQT7I|1.0|I loved the other Ice Age movies but this one just didnt do it for me. I dont think I laughed once..
B000W967KQ|5.0|This book is a creative and to-the-point lesson on changing your perception of life, love, and business. I have read many other books that were &#34;motivational&#34; and have praised works such as &#34;The Secret&#34;. Rightly so, those works were excellent. This book offers a look into the same idea through a different lens, a harder lense, a lense to be proud of.<br />In my case, this book is the key to the ignition in going all the way. Not just in business, but in my relationships and in life. Donald Trump and Bill Zanker crafted this piece to make it a very enjoyable read, a very uplifting read, and most of all, a very educational and motivational read. I wanted to put this book down so many times, but that was because I was too motivated to complete what I knew needed completing and start what I knew needed to be started. I had to put the book down. I had to get to work, because this book crafted in me a new sense of enjoyment and respect for my work and my life.<br />I am not here to sell this book to anybody. I am here to show you what this book has instilled in me. Thank you for this fantastic read. I am going to be starting this book over again. There is way too much here not to be soaked in.

B000KZBRG6|3.0|I thought that this product that was going to measure in lower light than it did. I attempted some indoor pictures and the meter would not even use a reading down to the 30 seconds as available on the scale no matter the ISO or light used. It just acted like there was no light. I did not worry about the quality. In the time I had it, it was durable and comfortable in my hand or in a shirt pocket between pictures. Amazon refunded me and I was happy about that.

B001AQO3QA|5.0|I have always loved the first three movies of this set and already own it in DVD format. I bought the Blu-ray version for $20 during the holiday sale. What a steal! Everything the previous set had, but now in beautiful HD. The Blu-ray box is one of the coolest I've ever seen. It is like a book and is very well done. As for the movies, it's all been said before, so I'll shut my face.

We purchased all three seasons from Amazon and  watched all the episodes Within a period of one month.<br /><br />Interesting story, great acting and good Blu-Ray reproduction.

1582701709|5.0|This is basically the movie in print. For many this is what works for them. I read this book first and then watched the movie. I loved this book so much that I wanted more. I wish - to be honest - that I would have gone straight to the movie as the movie is what I connected with on a spiritual level.
B0034DGPEU|5.0|I highly enjoyed this book.  It combines the struggles of slavery in the late 1700's from the unique perspective of a young Irish immigrant girl.  If you enjoy historical fiction that isn't too heavy, you'll love this book.
1451673442|5.0|Everyone needs to read this book at least once. Your life will be 'magically' clear in ways that you may have never considered. I have read it several times. I LOVE it a little more each time and LEARN something new as well.
1611134226|5.0|I loved the way it picked up right where the last book ended and went on from there. There were a few boring spots but overall the plot has just enough twists in it to hold your interest. I couldn't wait for the end but then hated to finish the book.
0446672653|5.0|No matter where you are in your search for answers to love and the meaning of your life, this book will open your eyes a little wider. It's impossible to start this book and not get 'caught up' in the story line and lives of those who participate in this amazing journey. I loved this book and loved that Dr. Weiss has a discerning mind to the possibilities...

B007SGLZP8|5.0|Had me turning pages and wondering what would happen next from the first page. I do not like to write extended book reviews I feel I did enough of that in elementary school so I will just tell you that if you are a John Grisham fan you will like this book. Yes he is a formula writer but I find his stories and premises interesting especially since I work around legal eagles. I can totally see how the greed and power could go to some peoples head and I love to think there is always a hero to the little guys. Keep churning them out John.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|There was only one season of Firefly, although a fairly successful film was spun off of the series. There could be said to be two main genres of science fiction screen adaptations. The first and most prevalent of these is the space opera – basically a “western” action piece set in space or in some futuristic setting. The second would be a philosophical speculation about how our current circumstances and essential nature (culture, social institutions, politics, religion, folly, etc.) might be expressed as time and technology evolve.<br />Firefly is primarily a lush and well-done example of the first genre, with generous and intriguing sprinklings of the second. Larger themes which run through the episodes include how people might bond or interact in stressful situations; what “ethical” might look like in the context of an essentially unethical civilization; and explorations of conformity or resistance to a powerfully dominant and intrusive culture.<br />That might sound bloodless or esoteric, but such themes are imbedded within what is, for the most part, inventive screenwriting and well-crafted plots. Science fiction succeeds when the projection into the future (or alternative now) is rich with consistent and interactive detail. If this series would have been allowed to continue it might have gone even more interesting places, but the season we have is worth investigating.  If you like Firefly, by the way, you will probably love Babylon 5 – a five season masterpiece.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|Could not put this book down.  What an insightful take on time travel.  Once again, Stephen King has opened our minds in such a poignant manner.  This trip to another world long ago can make one nostalgic for those days.  However, this author never lets you forget that this is Texas and nostalgia is not extended to minorities in any way, shape or form.  A beautifully written must-read book.
0440237688|5.0|Jonah, aged 12, is selected to be a receptacle for a futuristic society's memories in this book for young readers. Lowry's portrayal of a \\"perfect\\" society, with assigned jobs, clothes, spouses, and children, is as frightening as it is interesting. Its frank discussion of sexuality, infanticide, and suicide are perhaps a little dark, but a reader mature enough to work through Lowry's language should be able to deal with these parts of The Giver.<br /><br />Lowry's concoction is honest and hard-hitting. It is definitely a dark look into a possible future. It's important for the new generation to embrace the idea of individuality for the betterment of a whole society.
B004LROMQG|5.0|In this season everyone really fits!! They also introduce some known guest stars from HINT! HINT! ... harry potter Harry Melling (Dudley), Miriam Margolyes (Prof Sprout), Warwick Davis (Prof Flitwick & Griphook) Best season so far!
1906076642|5.0|[[VIDEOID:moERH2115IMAQP]]<br />AND OTHERS ADVISING ON HOUSING BENEFIT CLAIMS, THIS IS THE DEFINITIVE TEXT<br /><br />An appreciation by Phillip Taylor MBE and Elizabeth Taylor of Richmond Green Chambers<br /><br />`Fighting the injustice of poverty' is the motto of the Child Poverty Action Group (CPHG), the publishers of this book.  Now in its 25th edition, this authoritative volume, published in handy paperback format, continues onward as a formidable weapon in the on-going and seemingly never-ending fight.<br /><br />From lawyers to advisers in housing associations and local authorities, as well as students, this book is acknowledged by the professionals in this field as the standard text.  The publishers stress that it is used in all housing benefit cases coming before the First-tier Tribunal (Social Entitlement Chambers).<br /><br />As major changes to housing benefit and council tax benefit loom on the horizon, the publication of this completely revised and updated text is timely. Such changes include new dispensations on council tax benefit in April 2012 -- with a view to achieving a 10% reduction on council tax benefit expenditure, while at virtually the same time, the `benefit cap' will effectively be reduced.<br /><br />Also, as mentioned in the foreword, universal credit will replace housing benefit in October 2013 for working age claimants in pilot areas, while housing credit within pension credit will be introduced for older claimants above working age.  Details of these developments are encapsulated in the `Future Changes' section of the book which precedes the main text.<br /><br />Within its more than 1,300 pages, the book packs in all the relevant statutory material, together with expert commentary which includes analysis and references to official guidance, as well as the latest case law plus further help with practice and more, including much new material.<br /><br />For those dealing with cross-border issues in this field, there is augmented and updated commentary on the rules pertaining to housing benefit entitlement for people from abroad, including the test on the right to reside.  And as all information is indexed and cross-referenced, this volume is easy to navigate.<br /><br />For busy professionals seeking further avenues of enquiry, the book provides a formidable array of further and vital information contained in, for example, tables of cases, commissioners' decisions, upper tribunal decisions and comparative provisions.  There are two destination tables of respectively housing benefit regulations and council tax benefit regulations.<br /><br />If you find yourself dealing with housing benefit claims in whatever capacity, you'll find this book indispensable, particularly in this important new edition, in which the legislation is up to date as at 8 November 2012. Thank you all very much at the CPAG!updated commentary on the rules pertaining to housing benefit entitlement for people from abroad, including the test on the right to reside.

B008AK8FHM|5.0|In my quest to understand Heaven and what it is all about, what it is like, this book has opened my eyes to additional insight.  I also desire to understand time (thus far, my enemy - linear time) versus non-linear time.<br /><br />In my reading, I was surprised to come across familiar names such as Robert Monroe.  This book was a great read and I will be sure to pass it on to those I feel would get a great deal out of it.  It doesn't diminish the tenets of religion or belief in God; it simply provides support of beliefs one may already hold true.

B005LAIH3G|5.0|John Carter was everything I hoped it would be; it was exciting, funny, action-packed, and the visuals were great.  For those of you who watched the JC trailer and thought \\"this looks like a Star Wars or Conan rip-off\\", you couldn't be farther from the truth.  John Carter or, more specifically, the 'Barsoom Novels' are why we have Star Wars.  They're why we have Superman, Star Trek, Avatar, and Flash Gordon.  The themes within those books helped define modern sci-fi, and I'm so happy this movie finally got made after decades of attempts.<br />I know that John Carter was a box office miss, but the fact that it was (re)discovered on Blu Ray/DVD and is gaining such a strong fanbase gives it enough lift to push Disney into making a sequel.  I would definitely like to see that!

1781164266|5.0|REVIEW SUMMARY: A beautiful, haunting compilation of art from the bestselling video game horror franchise Dead Space.<br /><br />MY RATING: 4.5 Stars<br /><br />BRIEF SYNOPSIS: Over 300 iconic, full color images and sketches, with commentary from artists.<br /><br />MY REVIEW<br /><br />PROS: Absolutely stunning images that latch onto the mind in an icy death grip, annotations from artists deliver a glimpse into the twisted creative cycle that spawned such striking and grotesque visuals.<br /><br />CONS: Some may consider the price steep.<br /><br />BOTTOM LINE: An collection of art from all three Dead Space games, recommended for fans of the series, concept artists, and aspiring authors/horror film directors looking to add a serrated edge of inspiration to their work.<br /><br />So how is this for something different - I'm going to review an art book! Bear with me, as this is a first, but I feel as though my love of video games and my limited stint at an art school provide me just enough knowledge to get the job done. As a disclaimer I must warn you, I haven't played Dead Space 3 yet. Nor have I beaten Dead Space or Dead Space 2, though I have owned each at one point in time. One thing that always has impressed me with the series has been the unique art direction. Dead Space is a series that is visibly influenced by the titans of space horror that came before it. The Alien franchise is an obvious source, as is Event Horizon. Still, Dead Space has developed an identity all of its own. As the introduction of the book states, &#34;It has sci-fi that's never fantastical, horror that's always personal, and action that's delivered like a punch to the gut...&#34; I couldn't agree more. All of the science fiction elements of Dead Space are utilitarian. The future isn't a bright, gleaming beacon of hope - it's worn and functional and grimy. The horror is isolating and atrocious, and the action is limb-dismembering-visceral. All of this becomes evident as you open The Art of Dead Space and begin to flip through the pages.<br /><br />One of the coolest things about Dead Space is its protagonist, Isaac Clarke (wink wink). He isn't a genetically enhanced super soldier, he's an engineer. He's an everyman. Looking at early sketches you can see how close Isaac was to being a generic, yawn-inducing, action hero. Thankfully the developers went with the design that has become iconic - the serrated, &#34;ribbing&#34; motif. Further character designs explored in the book include a number of somewhat typical models but the important thing to take note of is the emphasis on the mundane. Dead Space isn't about form-fitting jumpsuits and flashy colors. The culture and fashion feel like a futuristic extension of our own.<br /><br />The Art of Dead Space includes internal and external renderings of the USG Ishimura, the &#34;planet cracker&#34; mining ship from the first game. From the outside the USG Ishimura stays true to the &#34;ribbing&#34; motif of Clarke's suit. It's an interesting looking space ship that doesn't conform to the tired images of the genre. From the inside the ship has a utilitarian atmosphere, it feels like a place that people live and work. This style is furthered explored in the tools that Clarke uses to fight the Necromorphs, to the environment and vehicles of Dead Space 2 and 3.<br /><br />The book moves onto the the Marker and the Church of Unitology. One glance at the Marker and you get the instinctual vibe that there is something very-n0t-right about it. I was less impressed with the designs of the Church of Unitology which feels tacky and unoriginal. But then the book moves on to the Necromorphs and if you were considering reading The Art of Dead Space before bedtime you might like to skip this section until morning. This chapter comes under the sub-headline of &#34;Twisted Anatomies&#34; and it would be difficult to find a more apt description. The creature concept designs are chilling from the unnatural angles to nauseating variations. According to the commentary the design team bought a goat at the butchers and pulled it apart to learn first hand about viscera and gore. Now that's dedication.<br /><br />The Art of Dead Space goes on to explore the drama and culture of the franchise. I personally found the section on Tau Volantis of Dead Space 3 to be especially entertaining, as it breaks away from the claustrophobic and dark settings of the first two games to instead explore the bleak harshness of an arctic environment. This time around inspiration is drawn from The Thing, and it provides a whole new flavor of horror.<br /><br />The Art of Dead Space is an impressive collection. The illustrations and paintings are vivid, some spanning a full pages. The talent and ingenuity of the designers is undeniable. For fans of the video game franchise this will make a wonderful collectors item. Even those who aren't diehard followers of Dead Space can enjoy the art and commentary, and I am a prime example. Anyone looking to write horror of their own or perhaps film a horror movie could learn a lot from the collected wisdom of the Dead Space designers. Some might consider the cost to be steep but for 192 full color pages, featuring 300 plus pictures, in a sturdy hardback binding I feel it's a fair price.ing variations.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I don't normally read romance type novels. I kept hearing all the hype and wanted to see if the book could live up to it.....it most certainly did! This is a book to get lost in and escape for a few hours. So turn off your TV, get a cup of coffee and get ready to enter a whole new world. It is so good, you'll be reading the next two and be yearning for more.
B000BF0D9M|5.0|You know how when you listen to an album over and over you get to where you know what the next song is?  Well, I've listened to these 2 hours of songs repeatedly and his selections are so varied, intricate and rich that most often it's like hearing it (again) for the first time.  Never stale.  You like either Jesse Cook's music or/and having your neurons dancing, fill your 'dance card' with this!
B00AQ3K8IU|2.0|A strange book with an unbelivable story. Could have been 150 pages less. I found the dialogue unreadable and could skip pages without missing any of the story. Not for me .
B00AQ3K8IU|3.0|After a great start I found this book a bit disappointing. The plot just wasn't believable in the end - had to suspend my disbelief just a little too far.
B001BZRUR4|5.0|Picked this book because I loved The Book Thief. Let's just say I don't know which book I love more The Book Thief or I am the messenger. Beautiful. The story kept me on my toes, continuously guessing, listening and hoping. The end was very much a surprise. I felt like I was going through these journeys with Ed, and every time something changed him I felt changed as well. The words Zusak uses are captivating that's why I loved The Book Thief and that why I love I am the Messenger.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Must read. Very good reading.  Could not put it down, would recommend it to every one. Keeps you on your toes
B0012GMXLU|5.0|This was an album that you can tell the band pushed themselves and added some new elements but still kept their core. When this album came out it was pretty much the only album (yes album) that was on the turntable for months. G

B006FO3ERQ|5.0|This was a story of an ordinary life, into which an odd twist came. That one circumstance changed all that followed. As it does for us all. We take each day as it comes.
1451648537|4.0|Rarely have I read a book that generated such an emotional response.  A genius and yet a not a human being that I could admire.  gave me great reason to pause and consider.
B006LSZECO|4.0|I was absorbed into the story line and the ebb and flow of the narrative. I really like the style of writing however I did not like the ending to be honest with you.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Takes just enough thought to keep it interesting. Fun but can have the TV on while playing and relaxing. Not totally mindless.
B0012QCZ54|5.0|The DVD came in excellent condition.  It was nice to see some of the actors remained in this movie and the dance moves were spiced up.
B0070Y46UY|5.0|This book in my mind has came alive, it an great read for the young or old. I will also get the movie.
B000VBJEEG|5.0|The Ratatouille DVD came in excellent condition.  Since, I love anything showing cooking skills, it was funny to see even rats can cook too.

B004I4H8QS|5.0|Well there have been dozens if not hundreds of reviews about \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" so I won't bore you with the details of the album, instead I'd like to try clearing up some confusion about which edition you need to own since there are so many of them. I have or have had every edition of \\"Layla\\" on CD. The origional 2-disc edition, the 1990 20th anniversary edition, the MFSL gold disc, the 1996 remaster, the 2004 SACD and this new 2-disc 40th anniversary edition. I remember that the origional 2-disc edition sounded very flat and muddy with very little bottum end, and it was packaged in one of those aweful double CD cases that couldn't fit in a regular slot in a CD rack. Does anybody else remember how thick those stupid things were? I quickly traded that CD in when I picked up the 1990 20th anniversary 3-disc box set. Much to my surprise I discovered that the origional album had been completely remixed so I had to go and get the MFSL gold disc edition. Let me tell you something! The sound quality on that gold disc edition was incredible! i heard details that I had never heard before, and I thought to myself \\"I've found the perfect edition of Layla\\". Then when the 1996 remaster came out I foolishly decided to trade in my precious MFSL gold disc. I hated the 1996 remaster from the moment I first heard it! The sound was harsh and boomy. Also some of the guitar solos were turned up so loud that I had to adjust the volume to be able to listen without endangering either my ears or my stereo equipment. I searched high and low for another MFSL edition, but since it had gone out of print it was impossible to find at a reasonable price. Than in 2004 \\"layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" was rereleased on SACD. The stereo layer on the SACD was a vast improvement over the 1996 edition, but there was still something not quite wright about it. The 5.1 layer was excellent as far as 5.1 mixes go. I've heard much better such as the SACD edition of Elton John's \\"Goodbye Yellow Brick Road\\" and much worse such as the supposed 5.1 mix of Boston's debut album, but I'm starting to get off topic. Sorry about that! On April 26th 2011 at long last \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" by Derek & the Dominos was rereleased in both a 2CD deluxe edition and a 5CD/2LP super deluxe edition. I wasn't interested in having to spend over $100.00 to get vinyl that I have no use for and a 2-disc live album I already own, so I picked up the 2-disc deluxe edition instead. The only thing I wish i had from the super deluxe edition is the new 5.1 DVD-audio version of \\"Layla\\". I've heard that it's excellent. Oh well, back to the review. Once again let me tell you something! The sound quality on disc 1 of this 2-disc deluxe edition of \\"Layla\\" is amazing! It's almost exactly like the MFSL edition with a little more bottum end, the drums are just a little bit punchier and the overall level of the music is just a bit louder than the MFSL edition. So in closing, if you wanna clean out your CD collection and you're not quite sure which edition of \\"Layla\\" you should keep, or you're thinkin' about picking this classic album up but you're confused by all of the editions of this album that are available, here's the answer to all of your questions. In my never to be humbled opinion, as well as my twenty five+ years of experience as both an avid collector of music and a hardcore Eric Clapton fan, the two editions of \\"Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs\\" that are essential to any respectable rock music collection are the 1990 20th anniversary 3-disc box set and this new 2011 40th anniversary 2-disc deluxe edition. The mixes of the origional album presented on the first disc of both editions are completely different as are the bonus tracks in both editions. Please do yourself a huge favor and add both versions of this wonderful piece of Rock N' Roll history to your collection today! I garantee you'll be glad you did! Thanks for reading this review. I sincerely hope that it has or will help you to make a wise and fully informed purchase. PEACE! PS If you're still unsure about weather you should get either the 20th or the 40th anniversary editions, I highly recommend that you start with the 40th anniversary edition since A, it's cheaper, and B, disc 1 is the origional mix of the origional album and not the remixed version found on disc 1 of the 20th anniversary edition. Then after you have immersed yourself in the beauty of the origional mix of \\"Layla\\", pick up the 20th anniversary 3-disc box set and prepare yourself for a whole new listening experience. CHEERS!
B009U9S6FI|5.0|This is a superb book.  If anyone thinks life is tough, then read this book.  What inspired me most was that Victor Frankl could have left Austria but chose to stay as he didnt want to leave his elderly parents.  He had written a book prior to his capture but of course was destroyed during his captivity.  But what a better book he no doubt wrote following.  This book highlights the belief \\"every stressful situation is an opportunity\\".
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Now, I can read my books anywhere. I don't have a Kindle device, but I have the Kindle on my laptop and on my Android phone. No matter where I left off reading on my laptop, I can pick up the same paragraph on my phone.  Totally best bookmark. Love it!!
B00AE2IJIE|1.0|I'm pretty reasonable with what my 3 and 7 year old  girls watch. We even watch James Bond movies occasionally. I have to say, this was not the family movie I thought it would be after watching the trailer.
B0072A3OGS|5.0|Despite the fact that this album 'makes'  me speed, I love it so much. A wonderful mix of old and new. Truly epic music.
0425263908|5.0|I was recommended this book since I was reading a &#34;popular&#34; one, and was told this one too was so so steamy!
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|I cannot wait to read Travis' s version in Walking Disaster.<br /><br />At times I felt so bad for Travis when Abby kept pushing him away. I just wanted to scream at her for not seeing how hard he was trying.
1400069289|5.0|This has a lot of great, current examples about companies, football coaches, etc. and how they help people do their best.
B000JMKQX0|5.0|I love apocalypse/zombie genre. But usually even though I like the stories because  I like the genre, they are poorly done or are the same story different book. That is NOT the case with this book. It's no surprise this was a NYT best seller and soon to be summer blockbuster.<br /><br />This is a war documentary and a zombie story and done so well. It's a must read for zombie enthusiasts and the general reader as well.
B005LAIH2C|5.0|Some might call this movie ridiculous, while others will say they hate this movie. I however will take a different approach and say this movie IS A  Really good movie!!! It reminds me  of why I still like the movie Zombieland  to this day; not because its an oscar worthy film or the storyline is the best there is, but because this movie is a hell of a lot of fun!! I was a bit suprised going in to the movie that it was rated R but if you get the opportunity to see the film you will understand why. This is not just a fairy tale anymore. Gemma Arterton was great (and very Beautiful i might add) as Gretel although i personally really enjoyed the take on Jeremy Renner's character Hansel. Storyline wise it is actually really enjoyable and the action is over the top. If you want to have a good time and are not expecting to watch A (oscar nominated movie), then look no further than Hansel And Gretel Witch Hunters<br /><br />5 stars
B008OOYALE|5.0|This is a fun and easy game to play. Lovely little dragons T9  buy breed and hatch with a LOT of quest  complete.
B002ZLAHE6|5.0|we enjoyed watching this movie very much and laughed all the way through it - we appreciated the good humor and that it was pretty clean
B009MO5960|5.0|Fast shipper received my order before the date great price seen the movie in theaters in 3d a must buy for all
B000TXNDUW|5.0|Jean-Luc Godard's Breathless is considered by film historians to be the beginning of the French New Wave in film, along with Truffaut's The 400 Blows. The film itself is incredible: a dangerous man meeting a beautiful young woman. The box set contains two discs: the film and the supplements, and a booklet featuring the original scenario and a few interesting articles. Overall this is a great film and a great addition to my DVD library. Enjoy!
B001JI8IJW|4.0|It takes some concentration to follow the &#34;trail&#34; of what is happening, but that's what an &#34;intelligent&#34; script is all about!  Thinking!  Great movie with a satisfying ending.
B00973DDN2|5.0|I love The Killers so much that it is insane. That being said, this is not my favorite album from them. THAT DOES NOT MEAN IT DOES NOT DESERVE 5 STARS. It is a fantastic album and I love it so much. It includes some of their best work and is so worth the buy. Long live The Killers.
0399226907|5.0|Got a few copies of this for my nieces and nephews to go along with the plush caterpillars I got for them.  A few of them already had the book but this board book is a great size and very durable.  5 stars.

B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was very interesting couldn't put the book down. I can not wait to read all of the other books
B005GG0MIS|5.0|If you enjoy politics and US history, you will love this book. I have many books about modern presidents, but this has to be my favorite - filled with fascinating details that are new to me. This not only reveals much about the individual presidencies of everyone from Hoover on, but reveals the previously unknown (to me) importance of the members of that most exclusive of US political organizations, The President 's Club.  Private
B00846F1YW|5.0|Fun & entertaining.  Challenging enough to keep my attention, but not so difficult I lost interest. My 11 year old niece enjoyed it too.

B008Y2FRFO|5.0|I can't stop playing this game. It's simple but VERY addictive. Reminds me of the games at the state fair when I was a kid. I love it.
B00AQL8VU4|5.0|I mainly use my kindle fire for reading.  I truly haven't used it for anything as of this time.  I have no complaints =)
B003O86FMW|5.0|Must I say more? The word epic means that the book was more than words. It was better than the hunger games.
B000W1V7K4|1.0|I have the DVD of this movie but it was defective so I decided to replace it with a Blu-Ray copy.  I guess the problems of the DVD were transferred to Blu-Ray. In the second half of the movie, it kicked me out 5 times; after that I stopped the movie. The DVD had issues such as kicking me out and then breaking up so much that I couldn't watch it.  The Blu-Ray didn't break up but just kept kicking me out.  I guess I will never own a copy of this movie that actually works.  Blu-Ray or DVD, they both have serious problems; don't waste your money.
B000002AGN|5.0|Sounds just as great today as it did when I was in college in the 60's.  Takes me back in time.

B003H6KRIE|5.0|I already own the trilogy in 3 individual DVDs, but I decided to get the blu-ray for a better quality and for compactness.<br /><br />The series great and even greater in HD.
B003ASLJK4|5.0|I could watch this one over and over.  The chemistry between Meryl and Clint is great which makes the story so believable.  A great love story to be enjoyed by a mature audience.
B00BHNQ5XK|4.0|It is truely a scary movie! I think any movie that has to do with possession is very scary and when you have children in the movie makes it even scarier.
B00AFEXRME|5.0|Am afraid of flying and this movie didn't help much.  It is a good, believable drama that anyone should be able to enjoy.<br />A rather sad story that turns out well.
B00AIQP9DE|5.0|Excellent story line. Couldn't put it down. The game has wonderful clear graphics even on a small screen. Lots of extras too.
B0064NTZJO|1.0|The first 15 minutes was not too bad, but that was only the 7 ads for other movies, then the 5 minutes of junk telling us who produced this tripe,  the movie went downhill after that. Really, this isn't arthouse,  its just mind dead trash that is just a waste of time that you would wish to get back. And these people wonder why Hollywood is in trouble.<br />Cliched dialog, boring music, terrible driving, flat characters, UGH.
B007ZGO7EM|3.0|Sometimes you just need a calculator and this one works fine.  I would recommend the Calculator Plus Free to anyone.

B008JGSM6G|5.0|I love playing this game.  I had relatives here and we each had our tablets on Kindles.  We all set and played and tried to see who could finish first.  I have played all the free games on free play.  I got a replacement device so and I starting the game over again.
B005FLX1HS|4.0|This a good buy for some different pop music to listen to, not much to say about this product. Few songs are god other you have to be in the mood for. Better music for light party back ground noise.
B007XKEY6Q|3.0|I have had some issues with Draw Something.  Sometimes I have to draw about 5 or 6 different pics cause it keeps coming back to me to draw.  (I don't know if it has anything to do with the slow interent or not)  I love the game if the issues were just taken care of.  I also purchased the game.

B006JPS1OM|2.0|The game stopped for me after Chapter 1. Assuming that was the end of the free version, I paid $4.99 for the full version. The game stopped after Chapter 2. I uninstalled and reinstalled and was able to start over and play through to Chapter 4, then it quit again. Not worth the hassle and definitely not worth the money.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I am a horse lover. I love this game it is like I have an actual horse. I would recumend this for any one. all ages

B006Y9BVRM|4.0|Beautiful watch.  Great value and functionality.  Not too big not too small.  A wonderful everyday watch.  Will go with practically anything you may wish to match it with. For those who perhaps would find the divers strap too limiting, there are a number of quality bands available that when such cost is added to this purchase, still speaks to a deal.
B00BF11STU|1.0|Heroic CIA operatives tracking and killing Bin Laden! What a story! It is too bad that this story is fiction. Osama Bin Laden and the Mujahideen in Afghanistan (which later became Al Qaeda) were CIA assets. This is pretty common knowledge in the FBI and the CIA.<br /><br />But of course they don't tell the American people that. So we go through this ridiculous tale of tracking down and killing Osama, who has probably been dead for about 10 years. But of course we never see the body, except in the movie, so that confirms the story through propaganda and programming but not facts. The facts lie with the Seal Team Six team, many who were killed in a helicopter accident shortly after this make-believe story. The Pentagon has no record of Osama's death. These are all facts. This movie only confirms the CIA's influence over Hollywood to spread the propaganda and deceit for their own benefit (always portraying themselves as the heroes of course). No DNA, no photos, just this movie!<br /><br />Torture is considered necessary with a feigned regret, because the hidden message is that torture is good and heroic when turned on the enemy. But who is the enemy? Americans think it is always someone out there; some nefarious mysterious boogeyman that deserves torture, never stopping to think this unmitigated war machine can turn inward on America itself. Ever hear of domestic drones, NSA spy centers in America, the DHS purchasing 2 billion hollow point tip bullets, the ordering of \\"no hesitation\\" shooting targets depicting American targets, including kids, pregnant women, and senior citizens, and last but not least DHS ordering 2,717 `Mine Resistant Protected' light tanks for patrolling the streets of the United States.<br /><br />Think before you cheer the message in this movie, and the justified treatment of your \\"enemies.\\" Most importantly stay conscious. The CIA loves to get their message across through to the subconscious with imagery of heroics, patriotism, and justified torture without giving the conscious mind the time to scrutinize the ridiculous story of Bin Laden, and more importantly where this is all going as unconstitutional power is justified and centralized.
B00AKEMHCA|5.0|I love this game because it has a lot of monkeys that have weapons destroying balloons. You really need to get this app
B0098460O4|4.0|With great anticipation, I put the CD into my player and was immediately struck by the sound of someone singing in a tin can. What gives I thought. After listening to the rest of the tracks, I realized that the producers of this work were more interested in a quick buck than showcasing the amazing talent of Jonathan and Charlotte. It's a shame because both Jonathan and Charlotte have such wonderful voices and they work very well together. If there is another production by this duo, I sincerely hope an effort is made to produce a well engineered piece worthy of the talent being recorded.In spite of the obvious lack of production qualities, this CD still rates 4 stars due to the beautiful voices of both artists.
B008JGSM6G|5.0|Both my granddaughters love to play this game too, though I like to think I'm better at it!  Still stumped by some, but it's a great game.
B006IN2F10|5.0|I have not had a chance to listen to the all three audio yet.  Invested in all three due to one of my children was reading the hunger games at school.  We had already seen the movie.. Love listening to the audio so I can also do other things unlike you are able to by just sitting and reading the actual book. Will listen to them over and over.

1609611543|5.0|I recently ordered this book and believe in the no-grain mantra. BUT, I have also read the diet book Turbocharged---which is a similar wheat-Bad book. I am considered obese for my 6ft frame and I wear a size 14 (woman) currently......but most people say I look normal (not fat). I totally cut out wheat (and sugar) for the last 2 weeks and I have lost right at a pound every single day. No joke, before I would often eat fast food for lunch and often eat ice cream, grains, sandwiches, pastries, etc...I just didn't watch what I ate or cared. But now, what a difference! I have lost a total of 13 pounds in 2 weeks and have SOOO much energy. I used to get headaches after eating lunch and it would linger all afternoon, and i would feel tired....I thought it was from staring at the computer all day. Since no wheat, I haven't felt tired at all and I have ZERO cravings for wheat or other bad-for-you foods. It's been a real eye-opener for me. I even think my skin looks clearer. Following the Turbocharged diet, I drink about 20-32oz water right upon waking at 7am and I don't feel hungry until 10:30am....when I do start to feel hunger, then i drink some more water and eat a mango, which is delicious and filling. I eat lunch about 12:30, which consists of a mixed veggie salad (or just leafy salads with lemon & olive oil) or just fruit, whatever I feel like....just nothing processed. At dinner time I eat lean steak, baked salmon (my fav), chicken or any other meat. The book says to do light and short excercise routines througout the day, just a couple minutes every few hours----never do too much at once. I am pretty busy with my work so I just walk around the parking garage at work for 30 minutes after lunch---because it 10 degrees outside :) The books says to eat your food types in 90/10 proportions. So if you eat meat, don't have more than 10% veggies/fruit with it. If you have veggies/fruit then don't eat more than 10% meat with it (just judge the volume with your eyes).  No grains, no oats, no rice, no processed sugars. This is probably more extreme than this Wheat Belly diet but I consider myself to be weak and have somewhat low willpower (hence being overweight). I thought it would be so hard, but it wasn't at all! It's not like anything else, last year I even lost 30 pounds once doing Nutrisystem, but after two months I couldn't bare to eat that crappy food anymore and gained it all back. My face is already thinner now and my pants are getting a little looser everyday. Just having so much more energy, no headaches, no indigestion, no heart burn, no stomach aches IS AWESOME---wow, I am in such a better mood and feel more positive. I don't need caffeine at all! (even though I never drank it much anyway).

B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I read a lot of books and love the ease of reading and buying books via Amazon for Kindle. Plus....you can't beat the price! As for this book....was the best in the Hunger Game series although ending was a bit predictable.
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|This app is a lot of fun,simple to use and quick to load. I find this a great way to pass time when I`m stuck at the tire shop or mechanics shop waiting for the car. If you like it you'll probably like the star wars version

0071762345|5.0|I haven't even finished the book, but couldn't wait to review this. Dave is somehow able to outline every question a business owner might have about social media! In simple, straight-forward, easy to understand language, this book explains how and why certain facebook marketing approaches work and why others don't. By simply reading, you WILL become a social media guru for all your friends after reading and I would argue you could start a consulting business just from the material in this book. One of the greatest aspects is the 'actionable items' at the end of each chapter, so you can get to work in applying the techniques right away. If you are unfamiliar with facebook or at all hesitant in bringing your business to social media, don't wait a minute longer--get this book!

B0050DIWFC|4.0|A very interesting twist  on a family,friends, and courtroom drama. The story was more than a who-done-it but how do parents deal with tragedy.
B003B02O14|4.0|Nice book to read.  It keeps you guessing.  Good book to travel with.  The books take to all corners of the world.  ZP
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This author has to have the best selling agent around. How did this book become a  #1 NY Times bestseller? I'm angry that I was duped into buying and reading it. I found myself &#34;rolling my eyes&#34; in disgust and boredom as this &#34;story&#34; dragged on and on and ... I was relieved when it ended although I do admit the final pages were the highlight. For a nano - second I was curious to know the source of Christian's problem and if it gets resolved. However, I have no intention of reading more or of recommending it to anyone. As another reviewer said, part way through I was compelled to look up the author in an attempt to fathom the source of this childish narrative. A grown woman? Erotic? I don't think so. Laughable? Amen!
0553386794|5.0|In this first volume, the author has created a harsh, uncomfortable vision of a world, roughly similar to Medieval Europe.  I thought it was very engaging to read, and the sensitivity to different perspectives made the book quite interesting.  The author has unmasked a world of ongoing danger and violence, where it is difficult to survive beyond one's youth.  In fact, it is even difficult for an appealing character, and one of the main characters to survive.  It really shakes one up and gets one out of one's complacent little world (assuming one is a bit complacent).  There is a subtle magical quality about the story, but the supernatural is kept in check so as not too intrude on the overall story.  There is just enough to add to the mystery and appeal of the narrative, told from the viewpoints of various main characters.  It is well-written and interesting.
B0068RHSCW|3.0|The story was okay and the acting very good.  I would recommend it to my friends.  The story was kind of different.
B000JQU1VS|4.0|Great book.  Big fan of Sherlock Holmes story line and Sir Arthur Conan Doyle.  Good price.  I would recommend to others.

B0097GVJWQ|4.0|This was a great game.  Only the fact that half way through it froze up and I lost all my progress and had to restart at the beginning makes me rate it at 4.  Will definately look forward to the next installment.
B000Q9ISSQ|4.0|Bill Bryson just loves to set himself up to fail or tickle our funny bones. I loved to laugh out loud as I read the calamitous travels he endures for our pleasure.
B008XBCJ34|3.0|GOOD movie (Not great) and was hoping to finally see the 3d i heard everyone raving about.  If you are getting for the 3d part of the combo pack i would almost pass.  It is one of the least impressive 3d movies i have seen on my tv and has NO extras. The only reason i gave it 3 stars in the end is because the regular bluray quality is phenomenal and like i said....GOOD movie
0765348276|5.0|I got this book as part of an ebook bundle. I read the book I had bought the bundle for and enjoyed it well enough, and then decided to peruse this one. It was easily the best book in the bunch, a welcome surprise! It's both witty and intense, charming and violent. The extremely likeable characters draw you into the gritty extraterrestrial world, and the technology the characters use is too ridiculously cool not to like (and badly wish for!) I can't wait to read the next installment.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Innocence lost by a hot, yummy man! It was a good start to Christian and Ana, but some things a little far fetched! Didn't like how it ended.

0062127241|5.0|Loved this book. Townshend is witty, honest and self-depreciatingly modest.<br />His book is thorough, covers every aspect of his life and while Pete is honest, he doesnt 'talk trash'.<br />There were songs from his solo album that I wanted to know 'more' about...but in hindsight you can't expect Pete to qualify every last song he wrote.<br /><br />I quite enjoyed this book, cover to cover!
B009M5CJI0|5.0|This is the usual superbly compelling Ken Follett work.<br /><br />(However, I wish that the that the physical quality of the book would have been as substantial as was the paperback version of FALL OF GIANTS.)<br /><br />Yasha J. Dalheimer

B0060MYM7O|5.0|The second season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" shows us the chaos that results in the execution of Eddard Stark and the death of King Robert Baratheon; \\"King\\" Joffrey finds challenges from Stark's son, Baratheon's two brothers and the threat of Daenerys Targaryen with her infant dragons overseas. Only Tyrion Lannister (Emmy award winner Peter Dinklage)seems to have his wits about him enought o try and restrain the sadistic stream that Joffrey demonstrates.<br /><br />The second season receives a stunning transfer for Blu-ray. Blacks are rock solid throughout. This is a nearly flawless presentation in terms of the quality of the video and is presented in 1080p, AVC encoded transfer (1.78:1). Audio sounds terrific as well with an active surround mix even during the subtle, dialog driven scenes.<br /><br />I have read about some issues with the packaging on this set here from other reviews but, aside from minor scuffs on the enclosed extra DVDs/digital copies (which are dual-sided and, let's be honest, most fans HATE dual sided DVD's)which are packaed in their own cardboard container, the set I received had all the discs and there was no problem playing any of the discs. I wonder if having BD-Live enabled MAY play a role in the issues with some of these discs playing (as that has been an issue before with some discs).<br /><br />Having said that, though, it might be wise to take a look (briefly so that if you haven't seen the entire series before you avoid spoilers)and briefly play all of your discs to make sure there aren't any issues.<br /><br />The special features are terrific and include the following commentary tracks:<br /><br />\\"The North Remembers\\" - Executive Producers/Writers David Benioff and D.B. Weiss<br />\\"The Night Lands\\" - Alfie Allen (Theon Greyjoy) and Gemma Whelan (Yara Greyjoy)<br />\\"What Is Dead May Never Die\\" - Writer Bryan Cogman and Director Alik Akharov with a secondary commentary track with Sophie Turner (Sansa Stark), Maisie Williams (Arya Stark), and Isaac Hampstead Wright (Braan Stark)<br />\\"Garden of Bones\\" - Carice Van Houten (Melisandre) and Liam Cunningham (Davos Seaworth)<br />\\"The Old Gods and the New\\" - Kit Harington (Jon Snow), Rose Leslie (Ygritte), and Co-Executive Producer/Writer Vanessa Taylor<br />\\"A Man Without Honor\\" - Executive Proudcers/Writers David Denioff and D.B. Weiss<br />\\"The Prince of Winterfell\\" - Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime Lannister) and Michelle Fairley (Catelyn Stark)<br />\\"Blackwater\\" - Co-Executive Producer/Author of Game of Thrones, George R.R. Martin / Commentary 2 with Peter Dinklage (Tyrion Lannister), Lena Headey (Cersei Lannister), and Director Neil Marshall<br />\\"Valar Morghulis\\" - Rainer Gombos and Steve Kullback of the Visual Effects Team along with a secondary commentary track featuring Emilia Clarke (Daenerys Targaryen) and Director Alan Taylor<br /><br />The quality of the commentary tracks vary a bit and, to be honest, I haven't had time to listen to all of them yet particularly the multiple commentary tracks but the three or so I've listened to have been pretty informative and provide interesting background including changes from George R. R. Martin's novel.<br /><br />Other special features include character bios presented with interviews of the various cast members, \\"In Episode Guides\\" which give fans (both those who have read and haven't read the novels) background on Martin's universe as portrayed in that particular episode and a terrific featurette on the Battle of Blackwater Bay.<br /><br />Additional extras include \\"War of the Five Kings\\" a featurette on those vying for the thorne as well as \\"Game of Thrones Inner Circle\\" a great roundtable discussion between the producers/writers and cast members about the evolution of the series and characters.<br /><br />\\"Religions of Westeros\\" gives us the motivation behind the action for some of the factions in the show. There are also a number of \\"Dragon\\" eggs and I haven't found them all just yet.<br /><br />Winding things up is a fold out booklet that tells us about the various characters, factions on the show which also includes episode information.<br /><br />The set is handsomely packaged in a box and the Blu-rays are in an accordian style fold-out holder with, as mentioned, the DVD/digital copies housed in a separate cardboard container.<br /><br />The second season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" continues to be as challenging, involving and intriguing as the first with some unexpected plot developments. For those who have read the novels there may be some disappointment over how the battle on the bay is presented or the briefer presentation of Jon Snow and his \\"captive\\" wilding but, over all, this is still a terrific presentation of a terrific show.<br /><br />Highly recommended.g things up is a fold out booklet that tells us about the various characters, factions on the show which also includes episode information.<br /><br />The set is handsomely packaged in a box and the Blu-rays are in an accordian style fold-out holder with, as mentioned, the DVD/digital copies housed in a separate cardboard container.<br /><br />The second season of \\"Game of Thrones\\" continues to be as challenging, involving and intriguing as the first with some unexpected plot developments.

B000E1ZBGS|5.0|LOVE this version!! I love the quality of the film itself, the cinematagraphy is breathtaking. The cast is perfect the perfect ensemble. I love the director's vision for this film and Keira is brilliant, her best role ever for sure. The Bennet sisters are have never been cast better and mrs. Bennet should have won an oscar for her performance. Not to mention Mr. Collins who is hysterical. The only negative it is a standard movie length so it leaves a lot of the book out.<br />[[ASIN:1478718498 The Fifteen Houses: A Novel]]

1742200206|5.0|I live near New York City but usually only go in on business. I like to checkout guide books once in a while to remind me of all the great things in the City that I take for granted. This book got me interested in playing tourist this Spring.<br /><br />The book's index is a good, simple five section index. It includes sections on planning a trip, exploring the City, understanding the City, a \\"survival guide\\" and a map section at the end as well as a pullout map.<br /><br />Some of the topics in the book that I like include a month to month guide to big events in the City, an \\"If You Like Section\\" which points you to places of interest based on whether you want to see museums or green spaces, a nice history of New York including a  history of food and the arts and a nice section on transportation in the City. The topics/sections are informative without being overwhelming.<br /><br />The book gives one and two paragraph descriptions of places where you can shop, eat and sleep.  These are similar to what you would find in many guide books.  The book also does the same for many tourist attractions.<br /><br />The book has a great \\"TOP SIGHTS\\" feature that spends up to two pages talking about a top sight. Top sights range from the obvious like Times Square, Grand Central Terminal and the World Trade Center Sight to the less obvious sights like the Lower East Side Tenement Museum, Chelsea Market and the High Line.  There is a great four page color filled Top Sight feature on Central Park that is extremely well done.<br /><br />There are a lot of nice color pictures in this book which make going through it more fun.  The edges of the pages are color coded making it easy to find sections.<br /><br />Finally there is a great 42 page color map section/index at the back of the book. Most guide books have pullout maps, as does this book, but not many have such extensive map sections in the book itself.  This is very well done.<br /><br />Thanks to this book once Spring comes Iplan to visit Central Park again and some museums I have not visited in years. I also plan to visit some places I have never been too like the High Line and the Lower East Side Tenement Museum.<br /><br />This is a well crafted guide to New York City. I think it is one of the top guide books around.

0316232955|3.0|Chris Colfer has accomplished so much in his life so far. He is a New York Times bestselling author, a Golden Globe winning actor, and he has written and starred in his own movie. Now Chris Colfer has tackled adapting his own feature film into a book.<br /><br />Struck By Lightning follows Carson Philips who desperately wants to get into North Western University. Carson is told that if he wants to get into North Western he has to make a literary magazine with submissions from other students. Soon he realizes that the only way people will submit anything is if he resorts to blackmail.<br /><br />I really liked the concept of Struck By Lightning because it was original and unlike anything I have ever read before. The book is written in journal entry form which really helped the reader see exactly what Carson was thinking.<br /><br />One of my major problems of Struck By Lightning is with our main character. Chris Colfer has created a very antagonistic and negative character who really got my nerves. Every single thing Philips seemed to have an issue with even the littlest things. Carson's attitude was very condescending and I couldn't stomach hearing him complain again and again. I guess Colfer succeeded in creating a hostile character but the problem is that I didn't like Carson much.<br /><br />Considering Struck By Lightning is a coming-of-age story I expected more of a change in Carson's outlook. Carson does grow from the beginning of the novel to the end but it is rather abrupt and short. Carson Philips becomes a new person in like 2 pages and everything is suddenly good. In my opinion it was rather unrealistic and irritating. I really wanted to see Carson slowly grow into a better person because you can't be a jerk all your life and you decide to become a better person in one second.<br /><br />Besides my dislike of Carson I did like the supporting characters a whole lot more. Melanie was a character that made me laugh a bit and her whole mix up with Suzanne Collins was extremely hilarious. The other characters are very stereotypical but it is a very accurate view of High School students.<br /><br />The ending of Struck By Lightning is really strange and I have mostly negative feelings about it. I don't want to give it away but I felt like the ending of the book was overly dramatic and uncalled for. I just feel like a contemporary novel should have a realistic ending to it that really ties up everything nice and neat. The ending of Struck By Lightning makes you think but is way too unbelievable.<br /><br />Struck By Lightning is a twisted story of one high schooler's attempt at a better future. SBL isn't always realistic but it makes up for it with humor. I haven't seen the movie yet but I do hope I like the movie better than this book. I look forward to reading Colfer's The Wishing Spell and his other upcoming books.lins was extremely hilarious.

But be warned, you will not be able to put it down once you start reading!

B009HNDCC4|2.0|While Modern Family as a show does not disappoint, the Amazon version is sorely lacking because of the lack of closed captioning.  Since the dialogue  is very subtle, much of the wit is easily missed without the captioning.  Until closed captioning or subtitles is available on more download videos, I probably will not use this method very much.

B0028RXXFC|5.0|For Thanksgiving of 2012 we went to Denver, CO. to visit two of our children for the holidays. We split the visit between the two homes. While staying at our daughters home she asked if we had seen HBO's Rome Mini Series. We hadn't. She asked us if we would like to watch it, since she had the first DVD and hadn't seen it yet. We decided that would be great since we are all interested in the Roman empire and between us we had probably read almost every book we could find on it (my husband has Edward Gibbon's \\"The Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire\\", and read it). For those who have not had the opportunity to see this mini-series...BE FOREWARNED!! IT IS VERY GRAPHIC!!! FROM THE BATTLE SCENES TO THE BEDROOM SCENES (some scenes weren't even in the bedroom, but you get what I mean). This leaves NOTHING TO THE IMAGINATION!! For about the first thirty minutes or so of watching we were all rather embarrassed. Not that the whole first thirty minutes was only gore and sex, but it wasn't long into the first DVD before both areas seemed to be covered very well. It took us awhile to adjust and since we aren't prudes we made some comments and continued watching the show. Then the actual quality of the mini series started becoming more and more evident to us. The actors all performed superbly. Each seemed very believable and almost were the characters they played. The building friendship between Lucius and Titus was the core of the series, their loves, hates and day to day problems made this series not only about the rich and powerful, but equally about the ordinary people as well. I've seen several Hollywood productions about Rome, Caesar, the Senate and of course Cleopatra. Those productions showed the city as spotless with white marble buildings and columns gleaming in the sun, while the citizens, both rich and poor, wore white tunics that looked as if they had just come out of a modern day laundry. THIS ROME IS DIFFERENT! You see the crumbling columns, the garbage in the streets with wild dogs and children fighting for scraps. Graffiti covers the walls of most of the buildings and is used to express the attitudes of whomever wants to have their say, or hurt an enemy. This series shows Rome in a much more realistic and human way. You will identify with at least one of the characters, if not more. You will love and hate any number of them depending on which episode you are watching. You will probably both love and hate them within the same episode. This shows the political intrigue that seems to be learned at birth. Women display their talents in this arena as well as men. The subtle, and sometimes not so subtle, battle between Servilia and Atia is a prime example. As I mentioned our daughter only had the first series. Before we left Denver I had gone on line and ordered the entire series. It was delivered before we got home. I'm glad I bought the complete series, we will watch it numerous times. In an excellent production like this there are always things you miss in the first or even second viewing. No wonder it won 7 Emmy Awards. It deserved every one if not more.<br />JUST REMEMBER THIS IS A VERY GRAPHIC SERIES!! However, in its defense it doesn't use sex and violence just to add to the selling  angle. It appears that during this period their attitudes where different.
B0072GPQNG|5.0|Now a major Broadway/West End London performance, WarHorse is a great story with human-equestrian bond, historical perspective, and fierce courage.<br />Its Saving Private Ryan meets The Horse Whisperer crossed with a little Finding Nemo, with realism and cinematography to impress. Lovable characters, tearful moments, and fabulous acting from the star equines.<br />Highly recommend for children as well - you'll fall in love with the maturation of this protagonist boy and his horse, resentful of the disposability of a work-animal during wartime, and mournful of the wartime carnage and loss of life for cause (displayed without gore or overt violence), WarHorse is magnificent and empathetic.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|So well written.  A great show for all.  Finally something of interest.  I highly recommend.  Warning......addictive!  You can't wait to see the next episode.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I love minecraft, I play it for both Xbox and pc. I was really amazed when they came out with minecraft pocket edition! I bought the full version right away! The quality is great and I suggest getting this game.I just wish that the nether was more accessible and easier to get to. They should add flint and steel so you can get to the the nether like normal and blow up TNT.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|It's awesome it's fun and adicting I play it every day I s uhh gets this to whoever plays temple run 1 or 2
B003JTHXOK|3.0|Nicholas Sparks writes love stories with a happy ending.  It's a sad story of abusive parents and then an abusive husband.  But Katie is sure (at 27) she deserves & seeks a safe place to live.
B000W93CHC|5.0|200 years have passed since Pillars of the Earth but Kingsbridge still has problems. This book is another masterpiece giving insight into life on the period. I highly recommend it but read Pillars first.
B005PK56TA|3.0|I tried to get into this series. Don't get me wrong, weird can be good. For me, it's just too weird and creepy. I only watched some of the first show.
B00B7G3NFU|5.0|This film went straight to my heart. What an amazing story of spirit and love. Incredibly well acted. Definitely an award winner.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Just as good as the first season. PBS has such a winner here. We get a good understanding of what life was for the elite. We all have our ups and downs and we are there for the ride.
B000VZUWZW|5.0|This is the best comedy ever. Once you start watching you are hooked. Way to go CBS this is a hit.
B004AKCMD4|5.0|This is really a beautifully done animation movie. It might be a little &#34;dark&#34; for younger children, but if you<br />appreciate how even the feathers seem indiviually done and their movement then adults will enjoy it and<br />older children will like the story.  It's a good versus evil thing.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this game has kept me interested and challenged for hours. its easy to jump in and play for hour,and this game has very easy clntrols.
B00005JLIU|5.0|This is such a fun movie. Silly story, great cast.  Besides it's got Carol Channing and Beatrice Lillie. Need I say more ?
B001YLWOI0|5.0|It's hilarious. It teaches you just how bad subtitles can be. Love the different &#34;accents.&#34; Good to watch with fellow French speakers.
B002CSC5EC|5.0|A &#34;happening&#34; frozen in time.  Music and musicians the like of which will never pass this way again.  It was never to be<br />duplicated though they are still trying.  A must see for anyone who lived through it and anyone who missed it.<br />Love, Peace and Happiness !
B001F0WXY0|5.0|always one of my favorite series, 4th read through just started.  Can't wait till my boys are old enough to dive in.
B00B4VI8MQ|4.0|Nice and easy with lots of hidden objects. Would definitely recommend this game to others. Not too expensive either, give it a go
B009EEFTMC|3.0|It's fun, however it becomes a little boring. I play it when I don't have a lot of time or a when I'm on the go.
B002MQYOFW|4.0|A gripping story - if a somewhat gruesaome one- told with a strange frankness that makes this a compelling read. The story is well set and narrated and the characters are real - for such a surreal setting. I recommend this book for all those sci-fi buffs who hanker for ever more arcane stuff.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|My husband & son is addicted to this game.  They play it all of the time.  I haven't played because I know I'll become addicted too.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|This is a fun alternative to smurfs.  I like the medieval theme with fantasy. Watch out Merlin! The graphics are cute and the game is simple enough to not be time consuming.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This book is one of the best I've read. A thick consistent plot with a phasing that will keep you up all night wanting to finish it. The author brings in a lot of courtroom facts and articulately describes the weight of emotions of the characters elegantly.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great musicians. Love pretty much every song on the album. The whole thing flows like a masterpiece of original songs.
B00AQ3K8IU|5.0|I would give this book more then 5 stars. I could not put it down. I immediately starting reading Colleen hovers other books right after. GREAT book and great author.
B005S9EJ14|5.0|I loved this movie and all the actors in it, it took me away<br />to another country of which I found fascinating - I have enjoyed<br />it at the movies 3 or 4 times and I also purchased the DVD and<br />have watched it 3 times - always a joy to see.
0307341550|1.0|Curious about all the hoopla surrounding \\"Gone Girl,\\" I was able to download the audio version via the public library (\\"Overdrive\\" digital books/audiobooks).  Before listening to it, upon recommendation from someone online, I decided to listen to Ms. Flynn's first two books before listening to \\"Gone Girl.\\"<br /><br />I was expecting \\"Sharp Objects\\" to be a well-written mystery, but as I listened to the audiobook I found myself rather surprised as to how amateurish the book was, how one dimensional the characters were.  When I got to the part about the hunters (early in the book), I must say those scenes turned me off. And then the gratuitous personal sex scene that followed...well, hmmmm?  This is supposed to be a good book?<br /><br />By chapter three, I had had enough.  I was flat out bored, and the oddly graphic previous telling of the hunters was still on my mind.  I decided to check with Amazon to see what others had to say about the book, and I'm glad I did!  I completely agree with the \\"one star\\" reviews.<br /><br />I was going to give her second book a listen, too, since I have it downloaded but now - eh.  Probably not.  I'm going straight into \\"Gone Girl,\\" hoping it is the best of the three. (Update: I decided not to listen to Gone Girl.  I really don't like Ms. Flynn's writing style.)<br /><br />As for the reader of the \\"Sharp Objects\\" audiobook, Ann Marie Lee does fine reading it \\"straight,\\" but when she goes into character as men, it simply didn't work for me.  Some audiobook readers are outstanding to listen to and make the copy sing.  I would rate Ms. Lee about a three and half on a scale of five.
B009B8YZIK|4.0|This product came very quick and the price was awesome. The packaging was also really good. I would highly recommend this product.
B006LSZECO|4.0|This was one of those books I couldn't put down.  I was reading some serious non-fiction when I reached out for an absorbing escape.  This was it.  Not necessarily a 'happy' escape, but a compelling read in that, even as a frequent reader of suspense/thriller/mysteries, I was surprised by plot twists around every corner.  From what I've seen in other commentary, the ending is controversial, but hey, it's the writer's world -- surprise me with a plausible ending, and I'm satisifed.  I was!
B0053O89IS|4.0|This product was an amazing price, and it came sooner then the expected date. The packaging  was the right size and was good.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Fun game and very easy to play on my Kindle Fire. Cards are very easy to see and I like how you just touch the card and it goes where its supposed to.
B00867GHS8|5.0|Who doesn't love finding Elmo, er I mean Nemo?!  Love the story and it's even better in 3D. Wonderful graphics and color!
B00A23MYCC|5.0|Funny and just a great adult movie! Not for children because of drug use, sexual content, and cussin! If you get offended easily do not watch this movie!!
1250027624|5.0|Great book, includes historical photos from the era, cast photos, etc. A good book to have during the Downton off season when you are going through DA withdrawals!
B0098G67TU|5.0|The movie is one i have seen 10x and still enoy it! My wife and I took the kids to the Titanic museum in Tenn and this helped us all get a better understanding of the titantic from the tour. A good classic of adventure and a love story!
B009LXEBD4|5.0|Love Kelly Clarkson -this is a good collection of all her top hits.  So glad to have them all compiled into one CD!
B00APUQRPC|5.0|Is there a movie he hasnt been good in?  A great combo of actors and story line... Another classic  Clint!!
B006H5120E|4.0|Been a long time since I had seen Titanic and was excited about the 3D version so I could watch it on my new 3D tv.  It was really good - still a little long in my opinion - but liked the refurbished version.  The 3D was ok - but since the film wasn't originally shot in 3D, didn't do a whole lot to enhance the movie.
B005HSL626|3.0|The game is a little boring. great for mindless swiping, but not at all intellectually stimulating. Kids like it though.
1250006341|5.0|Just as I said about the Chronicles of DA - a great companion book to the show with lots of historical and cast photos, etc. But also good to have during Downton's off season to keep you from going through DA withdrawals. Love the show!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|I have always enjoyed King and the book was what i expected from him. Worth the read and the $$.
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|This movie was awesome! Perfectly blending elements of classic Bond films with the realism and grittyness of the Daniel Craig interpretation.
B0083ZRAJS|5.0|The politics of the story are buried in the characters. Lots of fun but a little slow. Awesome free book.
0571202284|5.0|Richard Williams includes great advice not only for drawing technique, but also for professional approaches to practicing. His illustrations describe well what animation styles he's referring to, and they also are so beautiful I had another example of high quality without them being beyond my level as a beginner. I bought this book a year ago and continue to refer to it when I get hung up even on storyboards, comic layouts, or still drawings.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|not as good as 1 and 2. really too violently descriptive, liked the ending, but sorry I had to buy the trilogy, to satisfy my curiosity
B000B5MI3Q|5.0|This is a great watch so far. Haven't been diving with it yet, but it's working great on land. Solid weight to it and elegant looking. Good movement and keeps time accurately. Would buy it again so far. Might recommend buying one with a metal strap to look better with a suit.
B004XISI4A|2.0|Too complicated because of jumping too quickly between chapters and using so many different names.<br />Found I am concentrating too much on trying to follow the people and remember the names to follow the story.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|I first chose to get a case to store the Kindle and it didn't fit so I returned it. Then I looked online and saw the standing case. I am so glad that I ordered it!!! It is nice and slim and does everything it claims to do. I will recommend this to everyone.
B008Y5OWSO|5.0|The folks at Criterion are downright heroic, as well as masterful technicians.  My five star review is really about the quality of the restoration.  A movie that I had previously seen as a relentless brownout has emerged beneath the virtual grime to shine with all the beauty of the Idaho and Montana landscapes in which it was filmed (Oxford looks pretty damn great too!).  What we now have, then, is a cinematographic masterwork, a film whose colors and careful framing rise to the level of a true and glorious work of art.<br /><br />I'm not sure whether I will ultimately say that the whole package is worth five stars, but it's at least a four star film.  Sure, it has its flaws, but the occasional messiness of the story and plot recapitulate the messiness of history.  Without idealizing the Eastern European immigrants who have been targeted by wealthy cattle barons who cannot stand the thought of losing a single head of cattle to starving farmers (immigrants=wolves?), the film celebrates their presence in America by simply showing who they were, warts and all.  The lead roles are suitably understated (though Huppert and Walken really shine) so that the grand and tragic historical themes remain constantly at the fore.  While I doubt that this film is as great as The Deer Hunter (how many films are?), it's a worthy follow up to that masterwork, and in no way the fiasco that so many so quickly proclaimed it to be.<br /><br />Thank you, Criterion, for letting this work shine as it was intended to shine!
B00B5HQKNI|5.0|It was a great movie that had everything I was hoping for, worth watching a few times.  The story flowed really well.
B006MW3UZW|5.0|Once you've seen 1 show, you'll need to see all. World War 1 and all the tragic tales enfold to create another winning season.
B005WUHAX8|2.0|I had a feeling this case would be a fake....and I was right. The packaging is very impressive though. I have a real LifeProof now (I bought it at Best Buy) and there is a big difference in the sensitivity of the screen. I had to practically STAND on the touchscreen (from Amazon) for it to be responsive,  I gave it to my friend and I feel like it will do a good job of protecting her phone, but it will def NOT be 'lifeproof'..... If u want a case to swim with and take underwater pictures and all the things a LifeProof is supposed to allow u to do....just go get the real thing!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I use this to store all of the recipes I like that come in my email.  That way when I am out shopping for groceries, I can pull up a recipe and make sure I have all the ingredients I need.  I can also send the recipes out as emails right from the app.
B00820N2JG|5.0|Very funny and entertaining also its meaning is true so u dont feel like your time is wasted. I give 5 stars highly recommend
B003TJR2HS|5.0|I put the Otterbox Defender case on my iPad, then found that I could not attach to a set of external speakers I bought.  This alleviates that problem.  Easy to use.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|Loved reading from the viewpoint of Enzo - truly inspiring and made me think back to memories of my own dog and how she would have reacted in similar ways. Beautiful story, true storybook ending!
B007R21JJK|5.0|4 RAM slots, plenty of SATA ports, very sturdy, clean BIOS interface. Gigabyte's motherboard is really nice. I'll definitely be using Gigabyte motherboards in future builds.
B006MW3V6U|5.0|You are hooked from the season premiere. Well acted, great writing! I love the relationships between the servants and the Granthams/Crawleys and how they are depicted.
B008Y2FRFO|5.0|This is the most fun game ever. This game keeps Me entertained all day long and for many more days to com. I love it
B005LAIGYQ|1.0|OK so I respect the armed forces, sacrifices and such but man this movie does them no justice whatsoever. I honesty can't see why it would get anything more than 2 stars max and that's being generous.<br /><br />The previews looked amazing, i was so excited to see this but man my hopes of a great movie came crashing down soon into wasting my time watching this. The plot is simply horrible and dumb as they try to throw together a few action scenes which start off promising but ultimately fail after the first one. I thought hey i can see through bad acting for a good story and action but man there's no good story or action to try to follow. If you watch the first action scene you will be impressed but it peaks there and you can't help but hate everything to follow.<br /><br />The acting is horrible, so bad you can't feel any emotions towards the main bro-mance or their families as they go off to fight which really spoils everything. The plot is stupid, no imigination, typical bad guy needs to be stopped in a dumb attempt to cause a disaster. I actually thought there was supposed to be elements of reality here you know!<br /><br />If you want a good armed forces movie try Tramsformers as this movie does no justice to the men and women who serve and sacrifice to help rid the world of scum. This is just a typical B movie with real people in it and a larger budget. I'm a huge movie fan, I can appreciate flaws here and there and see through them but there's way too much here to forgive. It's true potential is wasted.<br /><br />Love the idea, the first big scene started so well but...<br /><br />I'm sorry to this I really am but it's so bad
B003TSEEDY|5.0|Best book I've read so far please make a sequel. I don't there enough tears in the world and voice boxes for me.
1616550414|5.0|This book is incredible! It talks about every character, every plot, and the evolution of TLOZ. A total MUST for any fan!
B0097EWK3A|5.0|I have played many hidden object games and most fall short of either a good story line, graphics, a good challenge, sound, or fun; and many times a combination of these. This game, as true of most Enigmatis games, does not disappoint, which is why I gave it 5 stars. I enjoyed this mystery hidden object game but would of liked to of had more of a challenge throughout the game.
B008IBPMZG|5.0|Downton Abbey is a great show and the quality of this copy is excellent high definition.  I have been watching it using the Amazon app for Xbox and it works wonderfully.
B0063IH60K|5.0|I enjoy the game, it is calming and easy to play-easy to play and not complicated-clear to see and easy to follow
B00005JOA0|5.0|Love this movie...it is my kind of movie...called &#34;Bonnet Movies&#34;? eh? I am a fan and guess i will always be..
1451696191|5.0|Now THIS book right here is why I love young adult fiction. This book absolutely blew me away from page one. I probably couldn't tell you one thing I didn't like about this story.<br /><br />Everyone goes to high school, but not everyone experiences it the same way. Charlie is such an in depth character and I related to him so much. While I wasn't exactly a wallflower myself in high school, I understood the feeling of being different. I wanted great things to happen to Charlie, I found myself rooting for him the whole way through.<br /><br />Sam and Patrick would have been my best friends in high school. I didn't hang with the jocks or any other \\"class\\" of people during those days. I wanted to be around people who were different, like me. I almost wish these three were real so I could be around them now. Patrick was definitely my favorite character. He was simply fabulous.<br /><br />There are dark parts to this story and there are light parts. Both come together to make this one of the best books I've ever read. Everyone should read this book, regardless of taste. And the movie? Phenomenal. The ONLY thing I want to know is... who was Charlie writing the letters to?
B007MC8YLQ|5.0|I love this version of Freecell and play it all the time.  It's easy to play and designed well. Best I've tried.
0887307280|4.0|Needed it for class.<br />A great read but not exactly what I expected.<br />It tells you how to be an entrepreneurs, to manage a business, and a bit on how you can revive a failing business.
B008FSCNTK|5.0|Again, a gift to my husband.  He loves her music and loves this CD.  I won't rate it because I'm not a fan of hers.l
B008GXHOFW|5.0|This is a great game!  It keeps my son entertained!  I would recommend this game but the player needs to know how to read!
1594744769|5.0|When I received this book as a Christmas gift my first thought was, its for a teen reader. When I finally picked it up and started reading, boy was I wrong! I really enjoyed this strange and wonderful story, it was an adventurous journey to take with Jacob. Bravo! Ransom Riggs, I do hope for a sequel.
