B007A4Y1NQ|4.0|Spike Jonze was best known in the early '90s for his music videos.  From Beastie Boys \\"Sabotage\\", R.E.M.'s \\"Parallel\\" to Bjork's \\"Volumen\\", Jonze would get the opportunity to direct his first major film titled \\"Being John Malkovich\\", written by Charlie Kaufman (\\"Eternal Sunshin of the Spotless Mind\\", \\"Adaptation\\", \\"Syndecdoche, New York\\").<br /><br />The film resonated strongly with younger viewers and also receive rave reviews from film critics, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" would win over 45 awards and receive over 45 nominations including Academy Award nominations for \\"Best Director\\", \\"Best Writing, Screenplay Written Directly For the Screen\\" and \\"Best Actress in a Supporting Role\\" (Catherine Keener).<br /><br />Championed for its originality, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" will now be released on Blu-ray and DVD courtesy of the Criterion Collection in May 2012.<br /><br />VIDEO & AUDIO:<br /><br />\\"Being John Malkovich\\" is presented in widescreen 1:85:1 and is a new digital transfer.  According to Spike Jonze, this Criterion Collection release \\"matches what our original print looked like and how we were never able to get that when we put out the DVD before\\".<br /><br />With that being said, its important to note that if you want the best video and audio quality of \\"Being John Malkovich\\", it's recommended that one purchases the Blu-ray release.  Having owned the original DVD release of \\"Being John Malkovich\\", the quality of the film is definitely an upgrade for this Criterion Collection DVD.  There is a bit more clarity and detail but I'm confident that the Blu-ray version will probably feature even better detail and clarity.<br /><br />As for the picture quality, according to the Criterion Collection, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" was supervised by director Spike Jone and cinematographer Lance Acord.  The new digital transfer was created in 4K resolution on a DFT SCANITY film scanner from the original 35mm camera negative.  The datea was then color corrected on a DaVinci Resolve at Company 3, with colorist Stefan Sonnenfeld.  Thousands of instances of dirt, debris, scratches, splices and warps were manually removed using MTI's DRS, while Image Systems' Phoenix was used for small, dirt, grain, jitter, flicker and noise reduction.<br /><br />As for the audio, the audio is presented in Dolby Digital 5.1. Dialogue is crystal clear and I heard no hiss or any audio problems during my viewing.  While the film is primarily dialogue, there is good use of surround channels during the entry to John Malkovich's head.  Once again, for better audio quality, I recommend going for the Blu-ray version for even better audio clarity and dynamic range on its lossless audio track.  Otherwise, the DVD sounds very good..<br /><br />According to the Criterion Collection, the 5.1 surround soundtrack was created from the original 6-track magnetic master.  Clicks, pops, etc. were removed using ProTools HD and then translated into foreign languages and redubbed to our original soundtrack master.  Crackle was attenuated using AudioCube's integrated workstation.<br /><br />English subtitles are presented in English SDH.<br /><br />SPECIAL FEATURES:<br /><br />\\"Being John Malkovich - The Criterion Collection #611\\" comes with the following special features:<br /><br />  All Noncombatants Please Clear the Set - (33:18) Filmmaker Lance Bangs documented the entire shoot of \\"Being John Malkovich\\" back in 1998 and trimmed it down to a half-hour portrait of the atmosphere on the set.<br />  John Malkovich and John Hodgman - (27:49) John Hodgman interviews John Malkovich about the film.<br />  Spike's Photos - (15:28) Made by filmmaker Lance Bangs, Spike Jonze showcases photos he took on the set of \\"Being John Malkovich\\".<br />  7 1/2 Floor Orientation - (2:12) The orientation video that Craig Schwartz watched before starting his new job.<br />  \\"American Arts & Culture\\" Presents John Horatio Malkovich: \\"Dance of Despair and Disillusionment\\" - (4:17) The episode of \\"American Arts &Culture Presents John Malkovich\\" that was seen in the film.<br />  An Intimate Portrait of the Art of Puppeteering - (7:20) A featurette by filmmaker Lance Bangs about puppeteering and how it was used in the film.<br />  TV Spots - Featuring four TV spots for \\"Being John Malkovich: JM Inc., Tunnel, Spithead and Vesselis humanus.<br />  Trailer - (1:55) The original theatrical trailer for \\"Being John Malkovich\\".<br /><br />EXTRAS:<br /><br />  16-Page booklet - \\"Being John Malkovich\\" comes with a 16-page booklet with the following essay: \\"The Original Piece of Wood I Left In Your Head: Spike Jonze in Conversation with Perkus Tooth\\".<br /><br />JUDGMENT CALL:<br /><br />Original and captivating, Spike Jonze and Charlie Kaufman's \\"Being John Malkovich\\" was a film that no one would ever expect to be made into a film, but because of its originality, it has become one of the most groundbreaking films to be released in America within the last 15 years.<br /><br />Back in May  2000, during my original DVD review of \\"Being John Malkovich\\", I often wrote about how original the film was and how Spike Jonze was going to be the next big director in the U.S. because of this film.  There was no doubt that \\"Being John Malkovich\\" was a film that would resonate strongly with independent filmmakers, younger audiences and the film critics, but watch the film again in 2012, you also realize how this film was ahead of its time.<br /><br />In the beginning, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" had a banal style of a man who lives a life that is not going all that great, his love for puppeteering is not as welcomed in today's society nor is it a way for him to make a living and there is a sense of disconnection with his wife, who shows more love to her animals (which he could care less of).  And the main character, Craig Schwartz starts to have a sexual attraction to his co-worker.  Once again, seems banal but that's where things take a twist.<br /><br />Who would ever think of a film where people can enter a tunnel and enter the mind of actor John Malkovich.  And those who experience it literally go through a life-changing experience.<br /><br />On paper, the explanation of \\"Being John Malkovich\\" seems as if it is being penned by someone trippin' on acid, but what he have is a writer striving for originality and a young director at the time who was creative and did thing his way.<br /><br />Charlie Kaufman is a writer who loves creating original stories and since \\"Being John Malkovich\\", he has continued this audacious style through films such as \\"Synecdoche, New York\\", \\"Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind\\", \\"Confessions of a dangerous Mind\\" and \\"Adaptation\\".  And Spike Jonze is a director that knows how to interpret Kaufman's originality with his own.  Jonze is not a product of traditional Hollywood.  He has come from a music video background and is known for his fascinating and cool videos for The Beastie Boys, Bjork, R.E.M., The Chemical Brothers, Weezer and many others.<br /><br />He is a product of a young, talented filmmakers that are known for creativity and he has shown that in his films such as \\"Adaptation\\", \\"Where the Wild Things Are\\" but creativity that also goes even farther when he and a group of friends created Dirt Magazine, he owns the Girl skateboard company and the collaboration between Jonez and Kaufman have been successful.<br /><br />Back to \\"Being John Malkovich\\", part of the allure of the film is how people want to experience the life of a celebrity.  And they can see it up front.  It's an invasion of privacy but yet people revel in it.  I don't think Kaufman or Jonze would know how life would change for celebrities with social media, Facebook, Twitter and how information is so readily out there for outlets like TMZ.com and regular people to know what celebrities are thinking and where they are at, almost real time.<br /><br />There are so many things that made me laugh while watching this film.  From the 7 1/2 floor where Craig works andseeing the ceilings so low, with a crazy orientation video, add in a woman who misunderstands everything that is being said, a crazy boss, a sexy (golddigging) co-worker and a puppeteer who seems normal but yet has some creepy qualities.<br /><br />And that led to the unexpected nature of how this film was going to play out.  I remember watching this film and thinking of how original this film was but also how exciting it was because it didn't follow banal traditions or storytelling.  And watching it again over a decade later, \\"Being John Malkovich\\" is still a wonderful film!<br /><br />John Cusack did a wonderful job of playing the creep Craig Schwarz and this is probably one of the few films starring Cameron Diaz (and Charlie Sheen) which I actually do like.  But both Catherine Keener and even John Malkovich himself were great in the film and how cool Malkovich was of the film's humor and the use of his persona.  For Keener, her appearance on \\"Being John Malkovich\\" would eventually lead the actress to appear in more films by Jonze and Kaufman and for Malkovich, if \\"Dangerous Liasons\\" or \\"Con Air\\" didn't make audiences know much about the actor, this film surely generated interest in him.<br /><br />And it was also great to see Octavia Spencer in an earlier, shorter role a decade before she would win awards for her role on \\"The Help\\".<br /><br />As for this new release from the Criterion Collection, eventually the new digital transfer is enticing since the film is on Blu-ray but for the DVD version which I am reviewing, the DVD looks and sounds good and as Jonz said, with the previous DVD's, he wasn't able to get the color to match to the original print, until now.  So, while the Blu-ray release is surely the definitive version to own, those who don't own a Blu-ray player and are fine with DVD, will still enjoy this release from the Criterion Collection.<br /><br />For those who owned the older DVD, while the majority of the special features are on this new Criterion Collection release, one thing that is new is the conversation between John Malkovich and actor John Hodgman (better known to many as the PC guy in the older Apple Mac commercials).  This interview was much more informative and enjoyable to watch than the older \\"An Interview with Spike Jonze\\"  which was not good at all.<br /><br />But what it comes down to is the new digital transfer and the Criterion Collection giving it a 4K digital transfer is a big deal because this film looks great on DVD and magnificent on Blu-ray.<br /><br />Overall, if you are a big fan of \\"Being John Malkovich\\" or a person who is curious about this film (or Criterion Collector who will buy the film no matter what), this film is a worthy addition to the Criterion Collection and is definitely recommended!nter a tunnel and enter the mind of actor John Malkovich.

B004A7UVLC|3.0|It's okay.  I felt it dragged on a bit and the jumps from one scene to another sometimes weren't clear why Holmes and Watson were where they were.  The weakest of the 3 episodes in the 1st season, in my opinion.
B005IZLPKQ|5.0|great movie it tells a story from the 1940's to the present, it is so well done, good acting, good actors. I can't wait to see the next one
B008133DO8|5.0|After season 1 episode 1, I had high hopes for this series.  I was a little disappointed by subsequent episodes.  However, with this season 2 episode 1, WOW...Sherlock is back!  The actress playing Irene is tremendous.  Cumberbatch and Freeman are as great as ever.  They really try to make Sherlock a little less robotic and more human in this episode which helps in caring for the characters.  I've said it before in another review but I'll say it again - Martin Freeman is going to be absolute perfection as Bilbo Baggins in the Hobbit!
B000JMKRKC|4.0|I liked this book -- I found it had enough of a mystery to it to hold my attention and kept me wanting to come back and read it more.  We read this for a book club and everyone enjoyed it.  Has some good twist and turns.
B00834R580|2.0|Have to agree with previous reviewer.  The Hound of Baskerville - lots of expectations for this one and it just fell flat.  Interesting take on the hound tale, but it just went on and on and was..dare I say it? Boring?  Also Holmes a bit caracaturish. The whole Mind Palace thing was cheesy and overacted (sorry Benedict - love you otherwise).  It was also just a bit weird to see our favorite London detectives out on the moors.  I know I know -- that's what I think of when I think of classic Sherlock Holmes but THIS Sherlock is all about London.
0345803485|4.0|Well~~ Quite a woven wicked tale. Captures the reader's interest from the first page, anticipating what is to come. Exquisitely written. A must read. Looking forward to her other novels in this genre'
B004B8RXQQ|4.0|Better than episode 2, not as good as episode 1.  Love Moriarty!  How perfectly unhinged he is. Instead of being a caracature of a mad archnemesis, he seems a believable sociopath.
B007Y1ARLA|5.0|Keane is back! This album is great start to finish and am glad they are getting back to the sounds they are known for best. Much better than their last album and closer to some of their first.
B00499K9E0|5.0|Stands alone as a great mini movie.  If you only watch one epi of this show make it this one.  Covers how Sherlock and Holmes met and sets up each of the characters as well as alludes to Moriarty.  Love all the main character actors including Mycroft.  Martin Freeman is going to make a FANTASTIC Bilbo Baggins!  He's got that adorable but slightly curmudgeony thing going on.

B007IXWL2C|1.0|I started losing interest in this trilogy during book 2 when everything started turning all vanilla and sappy between Ana and Christian. If i wanted a corny romance novel i would go to the drug store and spend $2.99. That's what this series has turned into. I enjoyed the first book for its frank sexual nature, pressing of sexual limits and the duel of wills between the pair. Now they are just a cliched fairy tale. I tolerated book 2 because i spent the money...book 3 was like flushing money down the toilet. Pass!
B006OCM0G0|5.0|This is a great game n very addictive add me plz dendj1984 I tip n gift daily thanx n advance
B003Y5H5HY|5.0|great acting grounds the movie, which manages to grab your attention and not let go.  dark and violent with plot holes that you could drive through, but still you feel for the characters and want to shout out to help/warn the characters as the movie telegraphs the action.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|this is a great game. it is fun just to use a side of your brain that normally does not get focus. you can put as much or ss little effort as you want to make the game fit your style with your friends and family.  I only wish you could save your own and others drawings as a feature of the game.

0439023491|4.0|This is the second book in Suzanne Collins's \\"Hunger Games\\" trilogy, and you can very much tell that it's a middle installment. The first half is basically fallout from the first book and the second half is setup for the third (with another Hunger Games inserted somewhat unnecessarily at the three-quarter mark) and yet at no point does it suffer from \\"second book syndrome\\". Sure, you have to read [[ASIN:0439023521 The Hunger Games]] to make sense of what happens here, and it does end on a quasi-cliffhanger, but somehow Collins averts the usual \\"nothing begins, nothing ends\\" problem that plagues most middle installments in trilogies.<br /><br />I think it's because it continues on so smoothly from the first book, and because so much happens that it crucially important to both what has passed and what is to come. In fact, having read all three books consecutively I find the starting/finishing points of each one to be rather blurred, and am left with the feeling that I read a single volume broken into three parts rather than three separate books.<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" picks up almost immediately after \\"The Hunger Games\\" left off, in which Katniss Everdeen was forced to partake in a fight-to-the-death survival game with twenty-four other young people from the twelve districts that surround the totalitarian Capitol. Broadcast live throughout the city and the districts, the Hunger Games are a way of reinforcing the control that the Capitol has over those it subjugates, with only one victor emerging from the arena at the conclusion of the game. However, Katniss managed to outwit the game-makers by securing the lives of herself and her teammate Peeta, leading to the unprecedented outcome of two tributes returning from the arena.<br /><br />It would seem to be a happy outcome, but in many ways her success has only created more difficulties. Having outwitted the Capitol and the sinister President Snow, Katniss is now deemed a threat to the stability of Panem, for other districts have been inspired to revolt against the government, using her as an unwitting figurehead. With unrest growing throughout the city and the districts, Katniss is presented with only one way to save herself and her family; by continuing the charade that she and Peeta employed throughout the Hunger Games as a way of garnering sympathy from the audience: pretending that her act of sedition in the arena was done out of deep love for her teammate instead of rebellion against the government.<br /><br />As such, the focus of \\"Catching Fire\\" can be drawn neatly in two. The first half of the book deals with Katniss and Peeta as they go on their government-required Victory Tour to the other districts, desperate to keep up the pretense that they're deeply in love, despite Katniss's conflicted feelings about Peeta and her oldest friend Gale. There she glimpses potential uprisings in the Districts and the Capitol, as well as rumors that the mysterious District 13 might not have been obliterated as thoroughly as the Capitol believes.<br /><br />The second half deals with the return of the Hunger Games, and here's where Collins tweaks her established rules a little. It turns out that every twenty-five years the president of Panem is allowed to make a change in the rules concerning the choosing of tributes. These particular games are known as the Quarter Quells (which were never mentioned in the first book) and in this case, the tributes will be reaped from the pool of existing victors. As the only living female victor from District 12, Katniss's participation in the games is assured.  Back to the arena she goes...<br /><br />The introduction of the Quarter Quell seems a convenient way of rehashing the structure of the Hunger Games, but it doesn't turn out to be *too* repetitive. Though it's easy to mourn the lost potential of Katniss being a mentor to that year's tribute (which would have been her role had the Quarter Quell not occurred), the second game is filled with enough surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat, particularly with an array of unique tributes that are given more personality that the kids in the first book, Katniss's attempts to communicate with Peeta without alerting those watching, and a game design that becomes more dangerous (but perhaps advantageous to those who can understand it) as time in the arena wears on.<br /><br />Once again Collins provides a very narrow point-of-view through Katniss's first-person narrative - but it actually works in the book's favor. Everything is immediate and personal, and whether she's struggling over her feelings for Peeta or scrounging for survival in the wilderness, Katniss always feels like a real seventeen year old girl. We don't get bogged down with extraneous detail about events outside Katniss's control or knowledge, and so even though most of the action of the first half occurs elsewhere, her vague awareness as to the conflict that she's sparked feels very real. In warfare, one can never underestimate the importance of communication, the difficulties in acquiring weapons, or the necessities of timing and propaganda, and Katniss's attempts to seek out knowledge whilst simultaneously being left in the dark is very much a theme of \\"Catching Fire\\". When surprising things start to happen in the arena, Katniss becomes increasingly aware of how much she's being manipulated, and not just by the Capitol...<br /><br />\\"Catching Fire\\" definitely has the traits of a middle book in a trilogy, and yet Collins manages to overcome them without forfeiting the defining attribute of the story: its pitch-perfect pacing. There's never a dull moment, and she has the gift of ending a chapter on just the right note that makes you want to immediately plough on to the next one. The stakes are raised, the suspense is built, and there is no such thing as status quo. That's practically everything you could wish from a second installment, and I'm thankful that I had borrowed all three books simultaneously: it meant there was no agonized waiting for [[ASIN:0439023513 Mockingjay]].ugh surprises to keep you on the edge of your seat, particularly with an array of unique tributes that are given more personality that the kids in the first book, Katniss's attempts to communicate with Peeta without alerting those watching, and a game design that becomes more dangerous (but perhaps advantageous to those who can understand it) as time in the arena wears on.<br /><br />Once again Collins provides a very narrow point-of-view through Katniss's first-person narrative - but it actually works in the book's favor.

0307592731|3.0|The book arrived in perfect condition.  However I was disappointed to find that it contains profane language in what I had hoped would be an uplifting book.
B0058HDHIC|5.0|Great 2 Disc Collection. After listening to the songs on this album, I went back and re-listened to her other albums with a fresh ear and newfound appreciation. There seems to be a number of eclectic influences in her style here, but it works! Overall, it is mysteriously  upbeat yet somber at once, but definitely what I think is her most mature album.  Play it on your good stereo with the volume pumped up to hear all the backup instruments. Lovely. Makes me want want to dance when I'm in the kitchen cooking. If you've never listened to Brun before, start here and work backwards.
B002QE3CTY|4.0|First of three books, it showed great promise in the different areas that I look for in a good post-apocalyptic novel. The premise was intriguing, the characters were well written, and nothing was too unbelievable. I am looking forward to read the next one, but I didn't immediately order it.<br /><br />The reason I am not in any great haste to finish reading the trilogy is because there were far too many instances of heavy-handed foreshadowing. Even the ending that wasn't an ending was pretty much as I expected. Without saying anything outright, if you have seen \\"Resident Evil: Apocalypse,\\" you will find the end very predictable.

B0055PGUYU|4.0|A lot of great stories. At the end of the book the author mentions that many people that read this type of book are looking for concise answer to the question, How do I change a habit. The author gives us the framework of habits and then some good ways to identify and modify them. This book I think is better than most because it sets realistic expectations that habit change is going to take work. It also gives us tools to identify what a habit looks like and where exactly to apply the efforts to make the change. I appreciated the stories because they kept me engaged but sometimes I did think that I forgot why I was reading the book. The stories were long detailed and distracting.
B00729GQ0A|4.0|I first became aware of this book on Twitter.  Rebecca Hamilton, the author, is an active tweeter, and I'm so glad I downloaded this!<br /><br />Sophia has returned to her small Colorado town after college, but she doesn't really want to be there.  Her mother's church is openly intolerant to her Wiccan faith, and because she witnessed a murder years ago, the rest of the town doesn't quite trust her.  But all of that pales in comparison to the supernatural mess she finds herself in after accompanying her best friend, Ivory, to a paranormal club.<br /><br />Earth elementals (vampires) begin hunting her, and Sophia must learn the secrets of her soul if she wants to survive.  Caught up in a complicated relationship with the magical mixed breed Charles, Sophia doesn't know who to trust.  Ultimately, her greatest strength lies within, but will she discover this before it's too late for the mortal world?<br /><br />This was a fast read reminiscent of Twilight.  The world building is intricate, if a bit rushed, and the story never lags.  If you are a fan of any urban paranormal, check out this book!

B007SWZVBQ|5.0|I own all of the prior Glee releases on CD, and really feel this one shines above the rest.  On pretty much all of the prior CDs, there is at least 1 or 2 songs that are so dreadful, that I immediately need to hit the 'skip' button.  Not so on this release.  Each and every song is a winner.  I am so happy to see the original cast go out on such a high note!

B001KQZ7I8|5.0|This book would get five stars even if only its first half was written.<br />It describes the life at concentration camp as pictured by the author Victor Frankl, who was a trained psychiatrist and a concentration camp survivor.<br />The author lost his wife and parents in Holocaust and himself experienced nadir of human suffering in concentration camps for three years.<br />He gives a very detailed account of how the various human mind states manifested themselves under conditions of duress. And it really touches you at a very deep level.<br /><br />In the second half of the book, he lays out his theory that man's primary motivation is finding meaning in life.<br />Logotherapy is his theory which gives an analysis of man's search for meaning in life. He proposes the basic principles as:<br /><br />- Life has meaning under all circumstances, even the most miserable ones. We need the right attitude to deal with difficult situations.<br /><br />-  We have freedom to find meaning in what we do, and what we experience, or at least in the stand we take when faced with a situation of unchangeable suffering.<br /><br />Contrary to what Sigmund Freud proposed, he says that there are objective differences in the behavior when human beings are subject to deplorable conditions.<br />Instead of harping on his own suffering in Nazi camps he instead chooses to focus on his message.<br /><br />\\"Suffering is not necessary to find meaning, but one can find meaning in spite of suffering.<br />To suffer unnecessarily is masochistic rather than heroic. Rather, a positive attitude can go a long way to ease even the most dreaded human conditions. And there can always be a meaning in life if one is ready to search for it.\\"

B0000DYKET|4.0|A few things to know when considering buying these.<br /><br />1. I usually wear a size 9 shoe but bought a pair size 8.5 and they fit very well. They were snug the first few times I wore them but now are nearly perfect for my foot.<br />2. The Bison color isn't as dark brown as I expected. They don't look bad, just not that nice dark dark brown in the pictures.<br />3. The anti-whatever insole does nothing to prevent my feet (which normally don't smell) from smelling. The lining inside the leather is great for comfort but the leather is a little hot and doesn't breathe very well.<br />4. The gaps between the leather are bigger than I expected. My pale feet are more exposed than expected.<br />5. They look better with a pair of black socks and jeans than I thought. Yes, yes, socks and sandals and all that. But if you want comfortable footwear, this is a win.<br />6. I was worried about the strap that goes behind your ankle and whether it'd rub my achilles raw. It doesn't. At all. Extremely comfy and I have no explanation for why!
B0055SWM08|5.0|It is an addictive game. You try to get a better score every time. Some of the puzzles are so intricate and also so simple at the same time.
B007MU85D0|5.0|Great album from an awesome newer band, very different and creative. LAKEHOUSE is probably my favorite from the album so far

B007SYWFRM|4.0|this was a good way to spend time playing a game without all the violence that is found in other game while being fun
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is the best thing since angry birds. it is really adicting. it is so cool! I &lt;3 this game. it makes me so happy! :) :) :)
B007V2UGPE|2.0|The game is very fun, until about level 30.  The game scales very poorly and becomes more difficult at an exponential rate, seemingly to get people to purchase stuff from the Glu store.  I don't mind making micro purchases, but it should be becausethe content us fun, not because it us needed to proceed.
0307346609|5.0|I loved reading this book but if you are looking for a skull crushing zombie novel that follows a hero or heroin through their zombie war experience look else where. This book is more or less a collection of interviews that the writer was doing for an \\"after action report\\"

B005K17RU0|2.0|When using the zoom feature this app would lock my Fire.  Nothing will work.  The only fix I have found is letting the battery discharge.  The off n on switch will not work.
B002KAJ0AO|5.0|I have to say that I hadn't been into the Backstreet Boys since 2002. I had been a supporter since 1996/97 so, I had all their previous album and had basically listen to those til I ended up breaking them from playing them too much. (Cassette tape days lol, good times) I had kinda fallen off the train, when they decided to take a much needed break. I remember after that break they decided to finally come back and put out a new album called \\"Never Gone.\\" I remember hearing \\"Incomplete\\" for the first time and was like \\"what is this?\\" and after that I was pretty much like um no I think I'm done. I would hear the song on the radio and everything, but it just wasn't something I like them doing. At first it sounded country to me for some reason, not that I don't like country, it just didn't sound like them to me. I remember looking at the album in the store, scanning the back of it, and putting it back down. So after that, time passed, they kinda had faded into the back burner of my mind. Then one day in Walmart, I saw another new album by them called \\"Unbreakable.\\" I remember picking it up seeing that there was only 4 members, I immediately put it back down, saying I'm definitely not gonna listen since there is only 4 members now. I was thinking to myself, what happen, and that it's not the same when you don't have everybody. After 3 years I finally decided to put back in their Black & Blue cd because I miss hearing their music, and it just brought back memories. So, I check to see what they were up to at the time, and it look interesting and fun seeing the soundchecks etc. So, I decided to listen to some of the newer songs from the albums I miss out on. (which wasn't grabbing me at first) While looking them up, I happen to lurk upon songs from this album, and I remember thinking, \\"wow they really are back\\" I remember loving all the songs from this album, I find out when they put this album out (I was about a year late after the release date) and I decided that when I came home on the weekend from college, I would buy it. So, I went to the store search around and there it was, one copy left of \\"This Is Us\\" (it must have been fate) I immediately pick it up and bought it, first time in 10 years, that I had bought a Backstreet Boys album. I been back hook ever since! I went back and re purchase all their albums from back in the day (the ones I had from then all the way up to the ones now)in cd form. Even though I love their last 2 albums, (because I actually decided to take the time to listen to them properly and not pass judgment) I must say that, this is their best album since \\"Black & Blue\\" and \\"Millennium.\\"<br /><br />Straight Through My Heart- (Classic Backstreet Boys) A great re- introduction to the Backstreet Boys.<br /><br />Bigger- Not one of my favorties, but it's starting to grow on me. (Wasn't a good choice for a single though)<br /><br />Bye Bye Love- Love this song! I love the euro-dance vibe to it (Would've been a cool single to release)<br /><br />All Of Your Life (You Need Love)- Good song. (Also love the message that is in it)<br /><br />If I Knew Then- A great upbeat song. Love the chorus. (Would've been great as a single)<br /><br />This Is Us- A cool song. (I just wish the vocal arrangement would've been arrange a little different) It being the song that's serving as the title track, not too sure about that.<br /><br />PDA aka (Public Display Of Affection) - A fun, quirky, sexy song. Something very different from them. It goes out of context of what they normally talk about in their music, which is kinda fresh and different.<br /><br />Masquerade- A really good fun upbeat beat song.<br /><br />She's A Dream- My favorite song from this album!! (Should've been a single. Also wish they would have perform this song in more places besides on tour) A really great R & B song.<br /><br />Shattered- A cool uptempo ballad. I like the chorus in the song a lot.<br /><br />Undone- A great ballad. I love the harmonies in this song. (Wish this would have been release as a single as well) They are showing here, why they were one of the best vocal groups in the 90s. (Which is one of their strong points as a group)<br /><br />Overall I give this album 5 stars, because like I stated early this is their best album in a long time. If it wasn't for this album, I probably would have never really gotten back into to them. This is a great solid piece of work. The more you listen to it, the more the songs grow on you, and you will see why in the long run this will be ranked among some of their best work.<br /><br />Good job boys, keep up the good work<br /><br />* * * * *
B007SSEBCU|2.0|Meryl gave her usual sterling performance with what she had to work with, which was not much.  This should have been a really good story about a marvelous woman and her time in office, when she WAS the Iron Lady, not her older years and failing abilities.  I found it sad and disappointing, not at all what was expected.  The author did her a disservice by almost ignoring her accomplishments and focusing on the wrong part of her life.
B000HWZ4A2|4.0|I need to read the book.  Since watching this film, I purchased a Kindle version of THE FOUNDTAINHEAD.<br /><br />I found the acting bad.  This has to be Gary Cooper's worst performance.  Most of the actors seemed to be reading their lines rather than acting.  This has to be Raymond Massey worst performance also.<br /><br />I bought this film because I wanted to gain a more intimate understanding of Rand's perspective.  For me, it was difficult to concentrate on the content, because the acting was too melodramatic.  I suspect that the vision of being over dramatic has changed since 1948.  However, I know other films of that era are better.<br /><br />I don't understand how Rand couldn't have seen this.  The bad acting takes away from the content.
B000FOQ0TG|5.0|OK, as far as the original album goes, I can't say any more than the excellent reviews already posted, so I'll comment on The Deluxe Edition. Disc 1 is a duplicate of the remastred single disc in terms of tracks, but with even further improved sound! Now for the bad news: The 2nd disc is from an awesome Empire Tour show at Hammersmith Odeon. It has only the Mindcrime Live part. The remaining songs from the show make up Disc 2 to Empire Deluxe Edition. I was quite excited about this, but unless I got a bad copy the Hammersmith tracks sound almost bootlegged. I'm real disappointed in the sound. Also, @ Mr. D This was their 2nd album to chart, but 4th overall, or 3rd if you really want to be technical. The debut was a 4-Track Eponymous EP ('83), N their 2nd was called The Warning. ('84)
B007TKT2SK|5.0|I used this calculator today on a real project for the first time. It's a real time saver and it was great not having to convert to least common denominator. Using this app is also very intuitive.
B0055SWM08|5.0|this is a gentle relaxing app that doesn't make you stress out.  The music isn't bad either.  would recommend this app
B005LAIHPY|4.0|This movie was panned by the critics, so I figured it might be fun to watch. And unless you're a military-hating type who only loves movies that show soldiers as suicidal, wife-beating druggies, this should be fun for you, too.<br /><br />\\"Terrible script\\", they said. Well, this isn't Henry V. It's a movie based on a Hasbro game, fer Pete's sake, so lose those snobbish pretensions at the door. The dialogue us mostly appropriate for the characters and the situation. It's not Plato. It's action and heartstrings. And this it does well. It's touching, stirring, and exciting. There are character arcs, albeit predictable.<br /><br />Does everything make sense? Mostly. There are things which are strange, such as the aliens' risk assessment algorithm. You'll just have to buy that, although it can be rationalized. Can a hothead like the hero become a captain, then be kicked out? Hmmm. Hard to believe.<br /><br />But it does feel good to see Americans and Japanese working together to save the world. You get to see the classic game translated to the movies, in a pretty clever way. There's lots of action, and well-shot, not like the crappy shaky-camera work in the Bourne movies. You'll like the characters. And you will tear up when the Missouri goes back into action with a geriatric crew.<br /><br />Go and see it wanting to have a good time at the movies instead of the artsy claptrap the critics love, and you'll be OK.<br /><br />I'd give it 3.5 stars. I have to explain this because I gave Saving Private Ryan four stars, too, for some perceived flaws. Yes, maybe I should have given it five, but I've messed up my own rating system, so ... anyway, it succeeds for what it's supposed to be.
B003EVWDR0|3.0|Avatar as a sci-fi special effects film is a tour de force. And the story we start out with is remarkable and immediately engaging. The indigenous culture Cameron created reflects surprising depth and perceptiveness - to an unusual degree for Hollywood.<br /><br />Unfortunately, the storyline begins to slip seriously soon after the marine's first experience with the natives. The good guys are all good. The bad guys are all bad. And while they're both mostly black-and-white and one-dimensional, the bad guys lack any sophistication or even minimal intelligence in their motives. After the good guy/bad guy scenario is set up, the rest of the story continues to live down to the cliche. All of which makes the pivotal transition of Worthington's character absolutely facile. Cameron has created a gorgeous, almost flawless diamond and he put it in a 14k gold setting. The brilliance of the Na'vi people and the special effects that express them can't disguise the cheap storyline.<br /><br />Although I walked away from the film feeling puzzled and let down, I would recommend it. Don't expect much in terms of character or plot development, and you'll be dazzled.
B0055SWM08|5.0|really good game. addictive and always a good puzzle for your brain. get it. word to the plays, this is good.
B001FB55YE|4.0|The film is clssic Ritchie. Good roles for all concerned. Loved the plot as well. If you have seen any of Ritchie's other films you would know what I mean. Always a twist in his movies, that is what I like about them.

B004EPYZV2|5.0|I have seen all of the Mission Impossible movies, and I would have to say they are all good, with the last two being my favorites. Tom Cruise can have different cast members, but still pulls if off. Hope this isn't the last one to be made.
B007SRWER0|4.0|Boiling down economic events into such clarity is not an easy task. Stiglitz makes the causes, effects, and policy issues of the 2008 Financial Crisis crystal clear to any lay reader.<br /><br />However, I will admit that before I took some basic economics courses, I picked the book up and put it down after a few chapters realizing that much of it flew over my head. Looking at it now, it's a clear and informative read to those with basic economic knowledge, especially compared to many other accounts I have read. But it isn't a completely easy read. Still, Stiglitz does an amazing job of taking the complex issues and simplifying them without cutting corners.<br /><br />There is a touch of bias in the viewpoints, but an impassioned piece of work demands this. Especially when talking about such recent events, and that which affect our lives so greatly. Stiglitz is one the leading intellectuals on the crisis, and if you were to pick up one book to understand the crisis in a nutshell, this will be it.
B00846F1YW|4.0|I cant get through the picture you move the tiles around and it looks kind of like the last supper.
0312427999|5.0|Klein delivers with power, amazing reporting and prose. I read many books, but I was compelled to write a review for this one.<br /><br />In \\"The Shock Doctrine\\", Klein delivers a stirring account of how capitalism is spread, often with damaging consequences, with the use of \\"shock\\" on a people - ranging from natural disasters to manufactured warfare.<br /><br />The book is very opinionated, and many may disagree with the viewpoints - she takes a clear stance against the IMF, Bush administration, globalization, the Chicago boys and the Washington Consensus.  After reading the book, however, it is hard to ignore her argument.<br /><br />Overall, her writing is so effective that I could not put down the book. The first chapter illustrates the \\"shock treatment\\" experiments that took place at McGill University in the 50's. From there, she gives numerous accounts of the spread of \\"disaster capitalism\\", comparing Milton Friedman's economic \\"shock treatment\\".<br /><br />Highly recommended, a new perspective on recent economic and political history.
B005L38QK2|2.0|I wanted to like this mouse because it looks really cool with the red lights and fits in perfect with my new Diablo 3 addiction. However, after using it for almost a month I had to return it.<br /><br />First off, mine was defective where the cursor would jump around on the screen every once in the while when it should have been perfectly smooth. I was using a black mouse pad and nothing was in the way of the laser but it kept happening randomly. Extremely annoying.<br /><br />I also had issue with the side buttons. They are too small and feel really cheap. They don't click very well.<br /><br />The size of the mouse is also too small compared to other gaming mice I've used. And it is not shaped to fit your hand very well at all. My wrist was hurting after using it when other mice don't make my wrist hurt.<br /><br />I'm back to using Logitech.
0374275637|5.0|I'm amazed at how long it took for Kahneman and Tversky's work to break through. Their work in psychology had a huge impact on business and economics, leading to the creation of the new fields of behavioral finance and behavioral economics. Their work demonstrates the systematic irrationality of human decision making, in contrast to the rational decision model that traditional economics is based on.<br /><br />This book is well-written and captivating. It will make you feel like the smartest person the room after reading it.<br /><br />No matter what your profession, I recommend this book. Shifted my paradigm every chapter I read.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love this game but would like more invest points! You get to a point in the game where you either have to pay or start over :(

B0054JZC6E|4.0|I like it. still working my way through. the snake game is still tough. silly thing. its a good way to pass time at the Dr office or something like that.
B0034G4P7Q|4.0|Facebook Is Built On Malice. I'm an outsider to the world of the social network. I have no interest in that world and from what I've seen it actually creates an antisocial attitude. I still believe that face to face communication is best. This film is well written though it does take certain liberties in regards to the truth. The actors are excellent in this film and believable. Fincher's movies always make me think differently. The soundtrack is loud, then again it's Trent Reznor's work which is great too. This movie doesn't get the highest rating because this story doesn't really surprise me. People are starving to be memorable, and will step on friends, family, honor, and love for money. You either love or hate this movie but you got to admit, Mark Zuckerberg knows how to succeed. On the side of my Florida Orange juice is the Facebook logo. Facebook is a force of nature, and any proof needed look everywhere.
B007R21JJK|1.0|Board failed less than 24 hours after being installed.  Replaceded with same brand  also failed right a way. Ended up with a sabertooth and have not had one problem
B0048JEEH4|2.0|I love this woman's voice, and the hit song, which is what got me to buy the cd.  But I was somewhat disappointed with most of the rest of the album.  It starts of with a bang and ends with a fizzle.  This isn't a slam on her talent, that she certainly has.  I just loved  the first song, and not being familiar with the rest of what was on the c d I took a chance and bought it.
B007B6T3K4|5.0|The mixing on this album is spectacular and the mp3 sound quality from Amazon sounds quite good on this album.  Definitely give this a listen through with a good pair of headphones or monitors.  I'm really speechless about this album.  The singing, composition, band, etc are all top notch.  This for me is my favorite operatic symphonic metal album I've heard.  I really like Manuela's pronunciation and she sings with so much passion, obviously inspired by Tarja, but better for me.  The band is also incredible, sounds kind of like Metallica style thrash metal, but goes into Celtic style at times.
B006RED4GA|1.0|This movie was awful. It took forever for the \\"action\\" to start. It was boring and made no sense. i really wish I didn't spend $3.99.
B007SYWFRM|4.0|you go to your home screen by clicking 'stuff&quot;, then you go to options!! its an awesome,  cute,  game! one thing i dont like is that you have to use acorns to buy a lot of stuff,  and acorns cost lots of money. well worth getting the app!!
B003UYUP58|1.0|The 1 star is for the eBook, not the book. I could never finish the book because of problems with the eEdition. On flipping a page, kindle kept skipping several hundred pages. You cannot go back easily, since you do not memorize the page number you are reading. So you have to keep searching for your page. This happened after every 10 to 15 pages. I contacted amazon. The rep reset the kindle, resent the book. But the problem did not go away. It was so annoying, that I finally gave up and returned the book.<br />I guess I will buy it from iTunes and read it on my ipad now.
B005UDD1R6|1.0|This app is useless. It doesn't play any video formats commonly found oh say... anywhere.  I never bother with reviews, but the lies and false reviews here made me feel obliged to help anyone else get stuck with this waste of space on their kindle.
B0052UZIFA|4.0|I understand this is a ported version of the game, and it runs great on both my HTC Thunderbolt and my ASUS Transformer, but I really miss the Vasebreaker mode. On the PC version, I was able to continue enjoying the game after playing through the Adventure mode a few times. Between the Vasebreaker and Survival Endless modes I'm sure I logged at least a hundred hours. Really miss that functionality on the Android version... can only hope developers release a subsequent update to bring the rest of the game to this version.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game for free. it reminds me of the nintindo days. nice graphics. my kids really loves it I use this app on my kindle fire.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game, and for all those hooked on the idea that you absolutely need to spend money to advance, you don't, you just need to be patient for acorns, and there is so much else to do anyways.
B005DOL0R0|1.0|Not happy with it at all. Great if you want to keep it in its cover but otherwise I'll make sure the next one I get has a full zipper.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I L.O.V.E this game! If you don't have it get it! This game is so much better then most of the worthless boring free crap on here. Now I'm not saying everything on here is crap I'm just sayin most of it is. But this is by far a 5 star game!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I wish I would have read these reviews first...Deleted from my Kindle...Waste of $$$ ! I believe women have more self respect,self esteem & a much higher moral standard.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I L.O.V.E this game! It is so cool! The best part is that you can play more then 1 game so if you don't like one there are still a bunch more you can play.
0345803485|1.0|Just sad that people loved this book. It dragged on for three books due to all of the repetitive sex scenes. The writing was atrocious and I can't believe I was forced through 3 books to find out what happens. Much better books out there with a lot more interesting plots, and much better writing.
B006S053K8|3.0|SNL personnel Hader and Wiig add nothing to this movie.<br /><br />The cast is okay and this movie reminds me of some made for t.v. movie made for the teen demographic.<br /><br />Good thing Stewart is pretty,that's about all she brings to the production.
B006PTZNRU|5.0|Very nice record ! Glad to have it on my CD collection, Making Mirrors is a wonderful journey in Gotye's singular  mind, a constant eargasm throughout the whole session.

B005GSZZ1A|4.0|This is a necessarily disturbing book. Were it not to have this effect then a reader must be alarmingly inured to the irrefutable evidence that Evil exists. I found myself hoping for an uplifting ending. It isn't there. Instead there's a glimmer of hope that, given an indeterminate period of time and a soul-healing environment, some restoration of a basic humanity may be achieved. I am grateful to BBC Radio 4 'Book of the Week' for alerting me to buy and read a book that leaves a living and challenging memory long after the book itself has started to gather dust on the shelf.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read this book because it was a number one best seller, and because some many people were talking about it.  Do yourself a favor, save your time and money... it is not worth it!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game! At first it was a little challenging, but I started to get the hang of it.
B008458O3S|1.0|Its true..this is a waste of your dollar on a kindle fire.  installs but will not open.  bye bye money.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|A wonderful story that twists and turns and is set in San Francisco. Absolutely loved this book..Could not put it down!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Good fun while waiting for an appointment. Better than a deck of cards for playing this classic game because you can take ut anywhere.
B0010X73ZG|1.0|THIS WILL BE IN CAPITALS BECAUSE CAPITALS ARE NEEDED. THIS IS THE WORST, MOST INFURIATING, STUPIDEST FILM EVER TO HAVE BEEN CREATED AND I HATE IT SO MUCH I CANNOT EXPLAIN TO YOU HOW MUCH I HATE IT!
B006OB3K56|1.0|I wanted this movie to be good. It was not. I had to purchase the DVD because I had no other means of watching it because if the rating. I'm not even sure why it had an nc-17 rating.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|As a few other reviewers have stated, I have read some erotica in my time of 50+ years. Back when I was around 20 or so there was a book called \\"\\"My Secret Garden\\"' that would make me blush to this day that was supposedly true stories. This book however is not erotica! I have to admit I came into it not expecting to like it simply because of what I have read in the past and I was right. Lets take the case of Ana who at the age of 24 is still a virgin. How believable is that in this day and age? Not very likely. Most 24 yr old's are either married, have kids, both or are making the club circuit and lost their virginity at the age of 13. My apologies to those that are still virgins. So the book got off to an unbelievable start with me.I also have to agree with the first reviewer I read here tonight that talks about the crappy writing.I was starting to believe that the book was written by a 15 yr old. I also wanted to delete it when I was about 3 chapters in. If this is mommy porn, how did those mommies get pregnant to begin with? Any mommy has probably done all the things in this book more than once and watched a little porn to go with it. It's apparent someone needed to sell this book badly and we've all been duped into buying it. I for one want my money back.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|I had started to read this book about the same time all the hype was being presented on the media.  I found the book to be resonable ok but nothing to meet all the attention it was given.  I gave this book 3 stars because of it's bravery to exhibit the stupidity that some women drag themselves into when they meet a good looking man with money.  Good looks and money do not permit a man to dominate a woman!  So in that regards I gave it 3 stars and I hope women realize how degrading situations could be.<br /><br />The book was well written - the content was boring and repeated situations - predictable.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|as long as I can continue to play it seems like a lot of fun. would like more energy and not have to wait or pay for it so often though.
B00440DRXY|5.0|Because of a few knee surgeries including a replacement, I can no longer run.  But I can walk and I read that a good running show may be better than a walking shoe. Whether you believe that statement or not I decided to look at some running shoe reviews and the Brooks Adrenaline GTS 11was rated high and at $80.00, it was a good price. I have been walking in my complex and on a treadmill and it truly gives me good support. I have flat feet so I need a wide shoe.  I was able to get width and comfort from this shoe.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|really enjoyable. the game is great to take in the car on a trip. I just wish I could unlock games faster.
B000Q6ZG5C|4.0|I didn't read any of the harry potter books. I can say the I've watched the first three movies and have loved them all.<br />If all you want is the movie, without extras, no commercials ... buy this disk :)

B007V5CF5K|4.0|first off, for everyone who cant get past the chief &amp; the phone thing... its not a malfunction. you just have to press the last few digits, not the first three. I love this game, but I cant get past the railway clock. help?
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Great Game.  Only problem is it freezes ever so often.  It's fun.  Great for people young to old. It's. addicting too.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|so so so so so much fun! I think this is the best game I have played on my kindle!
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is awesome because you get to draw stuff. You also get to communicate with the player that your playing with!
0618918248|5.0|This book had me almost in tears at some of the chilling examples of what supposedly sane people have done and continue to do in the name of religion. No, Dawkins does not present anything very new or radical here, but he does make a determined effort to debunk many of the myths surrounding not just religion per se, but even the \\"need\\" for religion. He succeeds, possibly beyond his wildest imagination, in getting his reader to just stop and think, to not simply accept the status quo simply because it *is* the status quo.<br /><br />Dawkins here relies on his deep understanding of evolutionary theory to rebut argument after argument typically brought up by religious minds striving to justify religion. For every \\"but why\\" from a religious stance, Dawkins has a compelling \\"because\\" that not only answers the question, but answers it in a way that, if you take an honest appraisal of the answer, will leave you admiring the beauty of truth all over again. That is the core of this book, really - an attempt to get the reader to look at fact, not just faith; to think, to actually allow one's brain the intellectual exercise of just imagining the beauty of the universe as it actually is, not as it appears to be when viewed through a lens of fear and repression.<br /><br />Read the book all the way through. Actually follow along with the arguments. You may realise that even if you are used to thinking for yourself, there are certain things you've accepted as true simply because society deems them so - without actually thinking through why they are or should be so.
0345803485|3.0|The best part of this book was finishing it. . . and I mean that, sincerly -- the end was pretty good.  However, I will not be reading the next two books in the series, mainly because I really can't handle hundreds and hundreds more pages of \\"gasping\\", \\"clamering\\", \\"chin pulling\\", breath-hitching\\", and \\"gaping\\" description.<br /><br />While I find the character of Mr. Grey psychologically intriguing, and will be reading the summaries of the next two books just to find out why he is as he is, I have no interest in trying to figure out why the narrator has sacraficed so much of herself just because this twisted, disturbed man who enters her life is so \\"hot\\".<br /><br />And for a novel loaded with an overwhelming number of sexual encounters, none of it made me desire anything but to just get through this book and done with it, so I could go plant some flowers, walk my dogs or download \\"something better\\".<br /><br />I gave it a 3 because people seem to either love it or hate it, and I didn't have an extreme reaction in either direction.
B003KRJNBW|1.0|This \\"for the easily entertained\\" film has:<br /><br />Denzel mistrusting everyone (because he has to) while looking bad-ass with sunglasses, killing very<br />non-charismatic bad guys every now and then.<br /><br />A couple of women following him around acting sympathetic towards his quest, but of course, in fear for their lives so he can occasionally protect them from harm.<br /><br />The gritty, barren wasteland in the background. (yay for Fallout 3)<br /><br />Did I mention all the boring bad guys?<br /><br />Take away those things and what do you have?  A pretty uneventful action movie with a shallow plot and no character development at all.  One star for being lifeless film, but not the very worst possible.  This film could have done so much better.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a very great app. it will keep yuu busy all day and its fun that the whole family can share. yuu shud def download this app. best of all its FREE
B0054JZC6E|2.0|I thought the games could have been better than this. I really hate, hate, hate, the graphics. Horrible game. don't get!!!!
0385523912|5.0|I love non fiction, but have a very specific taste in how the information must be presented so that it will keep me reading.  I couldn't put this book down and often fell asleep in bed with it.  The way the author lays out the events of the defectors' lives in this book from their early life, to the point where she's sitting there interviewing them is a great narrative of their lives.  It gives you such insight into a country we know so little about and what it takes to change a person 180° so that they can cope with impossible circumstances.  This book gives the reader the opportunity to learn how people really live in North Korea without a \\"minder\\" to show you what the government wants you to see.  Just as interesting to me was to feel like I was almost part of the everyday conversations and interactions with other people of the villages and cities.  This is a book I'll remember for a long time!
081297381X|4.0|I really enjoy in reading the book. I have read the book in three times. The content of the book is fun to read and make me rethink about the compelling phenomenons in the real life - we are live in a world full of unfair and uncertainty...<br /><br />However, the added part of the second edition seems a bit useless and not really interest in reading. And the cases suggested by author seems irrelevant to the topic.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is the most boring book I have ever read. I struggled to read the first 70 pages and keep finding myself wanting to do anything else but read this book.  Ana is a weak willed, self esteem lacking twit and Christian is just crazy and creepy.  I haven't even gotten halfway through the book and I could care less about these two people.  The fact that he's into BDSM and a dominant doesn't even spice up the story.  Boring characters = boring sex scenes.  And no offense meant to anyone who's into that scene, I just don't see the excitement about being abused, demeaned and humiliated. I also highly doubt a sexually naive virgin would be up for this lifestyle choice.  This was probably one of the worst books I have ever read!
B00783NWB6|3.0|Good price for a single disc 3D movie, when you hit \\"play movie\\" in your menu you will get the choice to watch it in either 3D or normal mode. My opinion - even if you don't have 3D capabilities, you should ALWAYS buy the 3D version. Who knows? One day you might and then you won't have to buy all new discs. The 3D is decent, nothing amazing and there are good special features. The movie itself is better than Underworld 2, but not as good as 1 or 3.
B003QTSMXE|5.0|Maybe Pixar's best.  I love the movie as a consumer of film, but I also use it in a Comp and Lit course at the college level along with Ayn Rand's Anthem and H.G. Wells's The Time Machine as part of a thematic unit on literary representations of future consequences of human/societal decision-making.  On a less geeky note, Pixar lately has become very, very good at conveying story, meaning and emotion without hitting the viewer over the head with obvious dialogue and otehr forms of gross unsubtlety.  \\"Up\\" featured an 8-minute dialogue-less montage that, in one Facebook poster's opinion, \\"did [emotionally/narratively] in 8 minutes what \\"Twilight\\" failed to do in four entire novels/films.\\"  \\"Wall-E,\\" on the other hand, goes its first 30 minutes or so with absolutely no words exchanged, other than \\"Wall-E,\\" \\"Eve,\\" and a couple of non-word synth-voice emotional outbursts.  The movie's opening scenes are more an extended form of interpretive dance, a high-tech take on old silent movies, but the story is as clear as if it were narrated by an omnipotent outsider narrator.  Amazingly well done.  The story itself is a touch unsubtle -- like Avatar, or, for that matter, almost any other Disney film -- but for that it can be forgiven.  Where it cannot be forgiven, if anywhere, is that in its unsubtlety, it is easy for many viewers to come away with the wrong message.  Most people I talk to think the movie teaches us not to shop at places like Wal-Mart, and not to over-consume.  (\\"We're just using and using and we're destroying the planet!\\"  How simple and shallow!)  On the surface, yes, it seems like a generic \\"green\\" criticism of man's overconsumption, gluttony, unthinking and selfish destruction of the environment as a result, etc... But that's just a red herring; that's just the vehicle used to convey the film's real message.  The real moral is the hell that Man descends into when he relinquishes his own destiny to apathy, convenience, laziness, and allows himself to be fedwhat he is convinced is all he needs by an ostensibly benevolent master, like a hamster in a cage sipping from a drip bottle.  In this, Buy-N-Large is not really a representation of Big Box retail (how superficial and obvious!) but of a Socialist-type government a la Rand's Anthem -- which in the process of having convinced the citizenry that they no longer need to be proactive and act in their own self-interests because they are \\"taken care of,\\" causes them to atrophy to the point of no longer even resembling fully functioning human beings who once possessed rational thought -- or of a futuristic stage of human de-evolution such as are represented by Wells's Eloi, where their total mastery over all human ills and societal/natural hazards has led society to the point where it no longer thinks it has to continue to develop itself, and all science, technology, education, and industry cease, leading to a reverse-evolutionary process of the weakening of the species itself.  If Otto (Auto) the captain's bot is Rand's society's government, then the fat floaters of the Axiom are the Eloi, and the *heroes* are the people who re-learn to think individually, break free from the herd mentality (something which none of the Eloi are ever able to do, but which Prometheus, the hero of Anthem, is), and take control of their own destiny -- the captain, even John and Mary.  The irony, that it takes a pair of semi-sentient robots to remind us what it means to be human and truly alive, recalls the final scene of Karel apek's \\"Rossum's Universal Robots,\\" and places \\"Wall-E\\" as the latest in the long and proud tradition of dystopian science-fiction pieces of literature -- yes, LITERATURE -- that teach us -- not to avoid shopping at Wal-Mart -- but to be rationally self-aware, proactive in our individualism, and to (occasionally) learn to bite the hand that feeds us.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love this app. I was this app was available for the Mac computer as well. I would recommend everyone to get this app.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|makes the time fly by and its free so glad I downloaded 101 games must have if I must say
0345803485|2.0|Admittedly, I picked up a copy of Fifty Shades of Grey because of all the press that it was getting. I mean, c'mon, The Today Show people should know what they're talking about, right? And, when I heard some of the names being bandied about to play the male lead, I was totally there. Ian Somerhalder? Ryan Gosling? Sign me up. Now, I just feel fifty shades of duped. I just hope that my favorites don't sign up for this one. They're much better than repetitive scenes of boring erotic sex with more repetitive and uninteresting dialogue; no Oscars found here. The one positive that I can take away from this-because I can't get my money back-is that if this can get published, well, there's hope for everyone. So hang in there, amateur writers, your day is coming.
B006W0QOF2|5.0|Its one of those movies that pulls you in and won't let you go...Loved every minute..the filming was awesome and all the actors were great..If you like Ryan Gosling it is highly recommended
B006RUJST6|5.0|This book \\"pushes the boundaries\\" by a debuting author, whom the critics want to reel into reality if her place on the human food chain. The reality is that you don't have to be a long-standing Oprah book club, Nobel or any other prestigious award winning author to write something notable! Way to go Colleen Hoover! You have caught my attention, and I'm a nobody!
0545405777|5.0|I love these books. I am on my second book and they are hard to put down. I haven't seen the movie yet, but if it is as good as the first book it will be well worth it.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I never really thought about what it really means to love the Lord. Recently I've been living for myself...but something all of a sudden today told me that i had been ignoring God for a while.  i had an immediate desire to read the bible and i was just craving the word of God. I am really thankful for this app because i recently lost my bible. it helped me with my craving....the more that you seek God the more you want to know
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|OMG, I love Adam's new CD!!!!  I cannot stop listening and dancing.  And his vocal is amazing WOW! Highly recommended, don't hesitate, go get it now!!!!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Poorly written, so glad I didn't purchase the book. I would strongly recommend ordering the sample prior to spending your money!
0307716546|5.0|I sat up to 3:30am to finish this book. I wanted to know the ending and was willing to walk around the next day in a fog of sleepiness. Thankfully, the ending was worth the sacrifice. This was one of the most rewarding books I have read in a long time. I had read her initial book \\"Sisters\\" and liked it but this was so much better, so much more engrossing and much more satisfying. I was hooked immediately.<br />  Grace and her daughter, Jenny, are in intensive care after being in a fire that destroys a school. Grace's 8 year old son is suspected to have set the fire. In a \\"Lovely Bones\\" twist, they leave their bodies and watch as the medical staff tries to save their lives, their families struggle with their grief and the police race to find the arsonist. The story is written by Grace as she talks to her husband who cannot hear her or can he?<br />  It works on so many levels. It's a mystery. It explores the mother-child relationship. It talks about grief. It makes you wonder if you would run into a burning building to save your child. What would you do to save your child? In the back of my mind, I remember my deceased mother saying to me time and time again, \\"If I could hurt for you, I would.\\" A phrase I said to my own children as they struggled with chicken pox, broken bones and relationships gone bad.<br />  I loved this book and highly recommend it. It's a great book for book clubs as there is so much to discuss. I hope you don't lose as much sleep as I did.
B000AJIF4E|5.0|Just got the MDR-7506 headphones today and am truly impressed by the quality. The cord is not too long (as I was afraid) and they are not overly huge (another concern). I use these with my laptop and they don't seem out of place. They are more comfortable than on-the-ear headphones (Sennheiser). The MDR-7506 sound quality is wonderful! Imagine actually enjoying music played on UTube, for example . . .<br /><br />The fact that these headphones are found everywhere and that you can readily purchase replacement earpads (from suntekstore, for example) is very helpful. Unless you absolutely must have the absolutely most portable headphones (Sennheiser PX 100-II), this is the one to get.
B007R41E8O|5.0|this was a really great game. I enjoyed the storyline, and the length of the game was good for the price. I had no troubles with the game like some have. I recommend it!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Great book! I read it on my kindle for android phones. Love it. However, the second book is better: more suspense and intrigue.
0060557818|5.0|After I read \\"The Sandman\\" books, I decided to try some of Gaiman's other works to see if they were as compelling.  I am so thankful that I started with this one.  The novel is one of the best books I have read this year, and it fully captured my imagination.  His characters are so well-formed and his pacing is so perfect that it almost feels effortless.  It is rare that I'm sad to finish reading a book, but in this case I didn't want it to end!
0547482655|5.0|I purchased the English version at the Museum Store in Rockefeller Center. Bought the French version for my mom for Mother's Day. The book tells the complete story and the pop ups are adorable and extremely well done. I know our family will treasure these books forever!
B000UZNSWM|5.0|This is  such a sad book detailing how many innocent lives were sacrificed because of corrupt, egotistical, political and money hungry people holding positions of power!  One can only wonder what is really happening today.
B005IYNQAY|4.0|After reading book 1 which occupied my thoughts for some time after, I found Book 2  just as entertaining and thought provoking
B007IXWL2C|1.0|I don't know where to begin. I will keep it brief since some people have already nailed my thoughts exactly (thank goodness!). Aside from the horrible writing, and nauseating overuse of \\"holy cow\\", etc. These characters are annoying! They are both very needy, immature, and petty! I found myself rolling my eyes and cringing throughout books one and two, and could only fathom 30 pages of book 3. Somewhere, there is an English professor ready to hang herself!!! Gag, and cringe. If I could rate these books 0 stars I would. I am nauseated and offended.
0307887898|5.0|Most folks talk about agile but dont really know how to execute. This books is all about execution and gives a direction towards that -- in some ways the author is sticking his head out and taking a stand, and thats the best part I liked. There are a huge number of books in this space - Agile this and that, Organization Structures for agile, etc but this is really on the mark on how to execute.
B004UBB3KQ|5.0|The trio Foster The People have an interesting backstory. While the group officially started in 2009, their history prior to their current band goes back a little farther. Founding member/lead singer Mark Foster originally tried to start a band on several occasions, but nothing came to fruition. Shortly afterward, he caught the attention of Dr. Dre's Aftermath Entertainment label, but nothing transpired. He tried to go solo, but he felt more comfortable in a band setting, which lead him to drummer Mark Pontius. a while later, they later added Mark's close friend- bassist Cubbie Fink. They sooon toured and recorded an EP which featured the controversial hit about a school shooting \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\". The song picked up on radio and became a huge hit. Immediately following the success of \\"Pumped Up Kicks\\" arrived their major label debut \\"Torches\\".<br /><br />On their first album, they channel a retro sound that is closer to the sounds of early Squeeze. In fact, to describe their sound, imagine if Maroon 5 made records like MGMT and Radiohead. \\"Torches\\" has production from several well-known producers. They work with Paul Epworth (Best known for Adele's \\"Rolling In The Deep\\") on the piano-driven \\"Call It What You Want\\", the devotion to love \\"I Would Do Anything For You\\" and the album closer \\"Life On The Nickel\\". Recording engineer Rich Costey (Franz Ferdinand, Fiona Apple, Audioslave) produces the new wave influenced \\"Don't Stop (Color On The Walls)\\" and the Scritti Politti-esque \\"Houdini\\". However, the producer that has the most prominence on \\"Torches\\" is producer Greg Kurstin (The Bird And The Bee, Lily Allen, Jem), who handles roughly half of the album- including the single \\"Helena Beat\\". Overall, Foster The People's \\"Torches\\" is a great excercise in melding electronica and indie rock with pop sensilbilities. Though they may be fairly young, their album sounds fairly retro in nature. Despite the album's brief timing, it's an enjoyable listen from beginning to end.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|The book is not as great as it is made out to be.  The characters are strong, but each is flawed, and they do not develop well.  Mr. Grey manages to knock down Miss Steele's character.  She does not stick to her own character, and constantly sways to the Grey ways and thoughts.  She has the ability to be herself, but she goes for the weaker character traits throughout the story.  The subject of the book, Mr. Grey has some good character qualities but he is severely flawed and he brings a negative vibe to the story line.  I do believe this book is fun reading for a person over 21 years of age, but I do not think this is a book that will help anyone with their sex life, and it will surely mess up a person who is a novice or first timer having sex.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I downloaded a sample copy of this book.  There was no indication about how sick this book really was.<br />I felt very deceived.  Very disappointed.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|First caveat is this show is not uplifting by any means. If you're looking for something with great acting and writing with a director that knows how to shoot scenes so things feel real and you get sucked right into the characters' lives, then this is it. The story is outlandish enough to be interesting and the dialogue is what holds the show together. A brilliant mind created this show.
B0058VW36U|5.0|This app is one of the best I have ever downloaded.  It is clever, witty, and requires thought to get through the levels.  Loads of fun!
B007MNV5WU|2.0|I do love this game. The new playing mechanic is great. But, I can not help but feel upset that I paid more for less content than users on other platforms. The game itself deserves more stars, but I won't overlook being shorted.
B0067R0APK|4.0|great app. I recommend to anyone who needs to know the weather and its forecast. try the free first. what could it hurt.

B0058VW36U|5.0|I love this game. Even though I am an app critic, I still think that this game is perfect for all ages. Even my sister loves this game.
B002RVZV9U|5.0|absolutely awesome guitar playing 3 legends at work must see viewing  play it loud and play it often  jimmy page and the edge are fantastic  10/10
0375842209|1.0|I usually love young adult books, and the premise of this seemed so original and fun, but I was sorely disappointed. I couldn't get past the first 30 pages. The voice of the narrator was so irritating I wanted to scream. If you have to write \\"obviously\\" or \\"clearly\\" once every sentence, you shouldn't be writing anything at all. I couldn't shake the feeling that the author was trying to force a style that he was not that adept at, and at the same time seemed so pleased with himself for what he was writing, I gave up on it way before I usually would. Not worth the hype at all.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|this is a perfect app for anyone into bible studies, or wants the word of God with them. very easy to use.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Someone asked me what this book was about and what the main theme was. This question was like asking what is the nutritional value to cotton candy? There is none. If you read this book simply for the pleasure of reading something that doesn't demand too many brain cells it totally works. I spend much of my working hours pouring over complicated and complex material that has a high demand on thinking skills...I picked this book up to read during my vacation. It was a good choice for a week of turning off my brain and reading something just for fun.
B001DPC52C|3.0|The Black Symphony concert stage is stunning and the band and orchistra sound unbelievable! However, the fast changing camera angles made the the concert almost unviewable, butchering the entire performance! There is not enough time for your eyes to adjust to what your seeing and you hardly ever get a good view of the entire stage to see all of the band at once or their backdrop screen. I read another reviewer complaining about this but had no idea it could be so bad it would be worth avoiding. It's really too bad because there is way more music on the dvd then there is on the cd, but to avoid a migrane I'll probably never watch the dvd again :(
B004FGMDOQ|5.0|miss peregrine`s home for peculiar children was so extravagant that i can only think of one word to describe it: amazing.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I purchased this book for the sole purpose to clear my head from reading scholarly articles and text books so I knew going in this would be a different kind of read. I'm about 70% through the book and I just can't take the stupidity of the content or the horrible writing anymore. Can I rate this as a NEGATIVE number of stars?
B000001IPP|5.0|This is my favorite Rancid CD. It was the first one I bought. I love every single song on there. Just pure gold. I love Tim's voice. Even though the one-star reviewers (who must be brain dead) say his voice sounds terrible, I love it. Even if it does, that's what makes the music great. The songs are not only catchy, but the lyrics are also good, especially on \\"Radio\\". Greatest punk album of the 90s by far!

6305128952|4.0|This is a great movie and story. Horses have personalities, hearts and souls. It is so fascinating that some humans have the gift to reach them on this level. Don't believe in telling the entire story in a review. Reminds me of being interested in seeing a movie playing in the theater, then having someone spoil it by giving away crucial points or even the ending....it's annoying. Therefore, if you need to know more check other reviews.<br />Robert Redford is a horseman and wonderful director. Other actors/actresses did a fine job as well. Story provided many levels of emotion and warms your heart. Was not really too fond of the climax though. Enjoy
B002SRQ214|5.0|Im currently on a budget and I saw that the price dropped $10 the other day and now it went down $15! What a deal! Read the benchmark reviews. This thing sure as hell beats the i3 not only in multitasking but also in price! This bad boy goes well with my asus 550ti. Make sure your amd board is amd3+.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I chose Fifty Shades of Gray (Book One) 1) because it was written up in the NYTimes review - must be reading worthy, right?; 2) because I figure that any author who writes a \\"trilogy\\" must have something to say; and finally, 3) who doesn't like a racy book from time to time?<br /><br />I got about half way through the book without understanding why 1) the NYTimes reviewed it; 2) what the author was trying to convey; and 3) got bored with the repetative sexual contortions (perhaps because I was not included!).<br /><br />I was certain that the next page would reveal the worth of the book until my daughter, who had also \\"kindled\\" the book for the same reasons as I, but who had read the entire volume told me that it was \\"more of the same\\" from beginning to end.<br /><br />That was enough for me to stop at about 45% read, and there it will remain (dormant) on my Kindle.

0399159029|3.0|In Prague Fatale Bernie Gunther, a sharp detective who hasn't crossed over with the Nazis, still tries to do a good job at solving complicated cases. The latest case introduces him to Ms. Tauber, who is in distress as a stranger tries to rape her or possibly to take something from her by force. A seemingly unrelated case takes him to Prague where he is commanded to protect a German general and solve the case of a would-be assassin. His skills and humanity are tested severely as he uncoves more than he is supposed to and as someone close to him is in grave danger.<br /><br />The author's writing style is humorous and jaded. The reader senses much regret for the horrors of Nazism and a longing for better times. As the protagonist says, This is the worst place in the world and the very worst is inside me.<br /><br />This is a captivating read though the resolution is not one of joy, as of course a world war could never be. Recommended if you have the stomach for an encounter with the horrors of WW2.
0345803485|1.0|How the hell did this book end up as best seller? This was some of the worst writing I've ever seen (outside the twilight series of course ugh!). Repetitious sentence structure, cliches and overused phrases, and the list is never-ending. I also don't see how this book is considered amazing under the erotica category or why it's considered so controversial... people should check out Anne Rice's Sleeping Beauty books if they really want to see some BDSM action or Cherise Sinclair for a better understanding behind dom/sub relationship. All in all was a horrible read, and thank god I didn't actually waste money (just read them at BN lol).

B0001V6ZJ8|4.0|This is an older version, John Huston's tale of love in the Moulin Rouge. The story is about a man with short legs (Jose Ferrer), stunted from childhood, that has difficulty with women. He is a painter, a good painter and does his painting at the Moulin Rouge where the dancers are his subjects. Brandy gets the better of him as he struggles to find love.<br /><br />The chorus line kicks to Offenbach's, Gay Parisian (also referred to as Can-Can) and ZsaZsa Gabor plays the young and beautiful star attraction at the Moulin Rouge.<br /><br />The DVD quality is excellent. The special features are all but non-existent. But I liked the film and recommend it.
0345803485|1.0|I literally feel like I could have written an entire novel of my feelings about this book. I tried my best to cut things back to just the core opinions in this review, but I apologize to my boyfriend who spent one brutal evening getting an earful from me about how repulsive up this book is.<br /><br />When I bought this book, I thought it was a romance novel with a bit of dabbling into BDSM. After starting it, I realized that in reality it's a book about BDSM, consensual slavery, abuse, and pathetic hopes of a romance that ultimately isn't there.<br /><br />When the book starts out, Anastasia is an innocent, insecure, virgin college student who has never been that into guys. She's only been kissed twice and has never had a real boyfriend. But romance and love are things she sometimes daydreams about. Then she meets Christian. He's handsome and mysterious, and for the first time, Ana feels sexual attraction.<br /><br />The problem is that Ana looks at Christian and wants romantic relationship. She wants to \\"make love,\\" go on dates, go see movies, and fall in love. Christian isn't into that and he makes it clear from the get go that he only wants sex; he's not a \\"flowers and romance\\" kind of guy.<br /><br />Despite that, Ana clings onto the possibility that one day a real, romantic relationship might be possible. She fears that if she doesn't do what Christian wants (by basically becoming his sex slave), she'll lose him and be alone forever. So despite her reluctance, she consents to becoming his sex slave, or his \\"submissive\\" as he calls it.<br /><br />Christian draws up a contract for her that literally says stuff like this is for his pleasure, she must do whatever he wants -- sexual or otherwise, she has to exercise 4 times a week, she must eat 3 meals a day (absolutely NO snacking in-between) and only from a list of pre-approved foods, she must always be shaven and waxed and attend a beauty salon of his choosing, etc. And then Christian has the right to punish her in any way he sees fit, should she misbehave or do anything he doesn't like. He is not required to provide a reason.<br /><br />Remember, Ana is completely inexperienced when it comes to sex.<br /><br />So she signs away her free will (note: she doesn't actually sign the contract, but she ends up doing basically everything that's in the contract). She's relatively open to playing with sex boys, being tied up, and she tries to obey his commands. But from the very beginning, she doesn't like the idea of being punished -- of being subjected to pain. But she decides to put up with it anyway (through her tears and cries of pain), because she's still clinging onto the possibility that she'll walk away with a `real' or `normal' relationship.<br /><br />I'll let this quote speak for itself:<br /><br />-------------------------<br />And he hits me again and again. From somewhere deep inside, I want to beg him to stop. But I don't. I don't want to give him the satisfaction. He continues the unrelenting rhythm. I cry out six more times. Eighteen slaps in total.<br />[...]<br />I can't say that I enjoyed the experience. In fact, I would still go a long way to avoid it.<br />-------------------------<br /><br />This is her punishment for jokingly rolling her eyes at one of his comments.<br /><br />To sum it up, I'm completely and utterly disgusted with this book. I have no problem with BDSM in general, but I don't view Ana's consent as \\"true\\" consent. I see her as an insecure and emotionally unstable girl who's clinging onto any shred of a relationship. Ana is a woman who has never been exposed to the world of sex, and suddenly her inexperience and innocence is being abused. Her insecurities make her afraid of being left alone, afraid of being abandoned by Christian, and afraid of never having a real relationship. So she clings onto this abusive slavery contract in hope that it will become something more.<br /><br />Even her flatmate Katie sees how damaging Christian is. She notes that Ana (who normally never cries) is constantly brought to tears by Christian's behaviour. Katie doesn't know the full extent of what's going on, but she knows that Christian is creepy and that he is having a negative affect on Ana.<br /><br />Side note: Ana constantly refers to her \\"inner goddess,\\" who I assume is basically her sexual side. But honestly, the constant remarks about her \\"inner goddess nodding in approval\\" or her \\"inner goddess spinning like a world-class ballerina\\" are just absurd. What the heck does that mean? Does she have some sort of multiple personality disorder that we weren't made aware of? I got really sick of her talking about an \\"inner goddess\\" and acting like her subconscious was a different person entirely.<br /><br />I think this book sends a horrible message to the reader. It's basically saying that it's fine to tolerate horrible pain that makes you cry and want to run away and hide, because one day you might get a real relationship out of it. And on the plus side, the guy will occasionally reward you by cuddling you and will buy you expensive gifts.<br /><br />These comments barely even scratch the surface of what I have to say about this book. At the end of the day, I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. My mom showed an interest in reading it and while I'll eventually leave the decision up to her, I'm making sure she knows my full thoughts before diving into it. I'm seriously horrified that people are praising and loving this book.<br /><br />I personally was more interested in hearing about Katie (Ana's flatmate) and Elliot's (Christian's brother) relationship, which seemed to be both loving and sexual.<br /><br />And on that note, I'll leave you with one final quote that really sums up what this book is about:<br /><br />-------------------------<br />\\"How did you feel while I was hitting you and after?\\"<br />\\"I didn't like it. I'd rather you didn't do it again.\\"<br />\\"You weren't meant to like it.\\"<br />\\"Are you going to hit me again?\\"<br />\\"No, not tonight.\\"<br />\\"Why do you like it?\\"<br />\\"I like the control it gives me, Anastasia. I want you to behave in a particular way, and if you don't, I shall punish you, and you will learn to behave the way I desire. I enjoy punishing you. I've wanted to spank you since you asked me if I was gay.\\"<br />-------------------------tes that Ana (who normally never cries) is constantly brought to tears by Christian's behaviour.

B00783NWB6|4.0|If you're looking for a good action flick with great 3D effects then you'll likely enjoy this title. If, however you're looking for any cerebral plot or story line look elsewhere. This is a movie to watch when you're simply looking for action and want to take your 3D TV and DVD player for a run of fun. If this were not available in 3D, I wouldn't bother with it as there are too many other action/special effect flicks that I'd personally prefer. For fans of 3D though this is a fun ride.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|Great game to waste time with. Fairly simple, yet challenging mini games to play. And it's fairly simple to get coins that unlock other games.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Mobility's games are well thought out to make the game board easy to see and lots of shortcut type moves so you don't have to keep moving individual cards when your future is obvious.  I would love to see a commercial-free low cost version for Kindle Fire.
B007MNV5WU|2.0|it says there is more levels comeing but they don't also 2.99 for this its just stupid don't buy it trust me DONT
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|This game is great! I love it because you get to play with ur friends and chat with them too! GREAT GAME!
B0041T52S6|1.0|Cannot even begin to convey how much I hated this movie.  It is so NOT entertaining.  It is so pointless.  It is so mind-numbingly bad in every respect--writing, directing, acting, editing, cinematography, sound, SFX.  This movie should be used by the CIA in their secret overseas prisons as a torture device--just strap their prisoners into a chair and make them watch this movie (I mean torture device) and I'm sure by the second or third viewing the detainees will be screaming to give up any information they have.  Yes, this movie is that painful to watch.  I went into it with huge hopes because I am a huge fan of Edgar Wright.  I consider Shaun of the Dead and Hot Fuzz to be masterfully made films in all regards.  Unfortunately, it seems like Wright is going to be one of those wildly uneven directors who makes both the best and worst movies of all time.  Hopefully this movie will be Wright's all time worst.  It's hard to believe any movie could be worse than Scott Pilgrim.

B005S9EJZA|5.0|I loved this movie. The acting was so good. Zac and Tayor did a superb job. My husband liked this movie as well.<br />The story flowed from beginning to end.  You will love it.
B005V2EVBQ|5.0|I figured since I bought that crazy-expensive Kindle Fire, I needed something to help protect it.  I wanted sturdy but aluminum cases and pelican cases were just too impractical.  Heck, I bought the Kindle so I wouldn't need to lug around bulky books, so why buy an aluminum case.  This MicroShell was the perfect solution.  It's lightweight, sturdy and has an elastic band to hold the case snugly closed when I'm not using it.  It can also be shaped into a stand but I don't see using that bonus feature.  That's too much like doing Origami and I'm not into that.  I bought the Kindle to read ebooks and maybe check email.  This cover is perfect for it.  It's made of sturdy material and fits on the Kindle Fire very well, and it doesn't add bulk.  It's a winner.
0345803485|4.0|I truly enjoyed the series I couldn't put my Kindle down till I was totally finished.  They were a bit over the top at times but enjoyed the story.

B007MNV5WU|4.0|I love this game a lot but I finished it in 10 minitues and its over priced for just a few levels on the kindle fire it need more levlesand its a little to easy but its like awesome and I love it
1577314808|5.0|This book is easy to read and great for those who are looking for positive inspiration in their lives. Does not push religion or one way thinking. Intellectually stimulating!
B002BY77CW|1.0|What a let down. The book is flat with little to no excitement and is written so the characters seem to talk in third person. I couldn't bring myself to continue reading past the third chapter. I was hoping for a light, fun and easy to read book, but this is not it...booooo.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun especially unlocking different games. great free app! highly recommended way of killing some time. collecting coins is easy too
B0050DIWFC|1.0|I can't believe some people gave this book 5 stars. Was  I reading the same book? In my opionion it was boring and completely predictable. The characters were one dimensional and the only reason I finished it was because I was hoping for more.
0740797719|3.0|Ok, first, I love the book. It's beautiful and full of wonderful examples, but based on the description I expected a bit more information on each type of light. It's not explained very well at all, and for the beginner, it's difficult to discern what the writer means when looking at each example. Other than that I love looking at the different lights.<br /><br />One more thing.... it's full of dinosaurs. :D<br /><br />Kri
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Terrific story. Well-defined characters. Reading until the wee hours of the morning suspense. LOVE IT! Hugh, you are gifted. Keep it coming!
B005DESVPO|2.0|I have about 100 other CD's that I've never had trouble with.  This one, the EP lenghth CD, will only play the first track.  It works ok in my car CD player but who wants to carry a bunch of cd's when I could just plug in my iPOD.<br /><br />Short overall (EP) but a talented showing with some great music. Obviously disappointing technical work by Warner Bros. Recordings.  Hopefully this young artist will find a better studio next time.
B0063IH60K|5.0|always nice to have a simple game you know how to play. it is enjoyable to play when I want to think but relax.
B004H4XL7E|4.0|Interesting read. It's essentially a framework to pitch things, but moreso, it's about understanding the psychology of the client and where their mind is at the various stages in the 'pitch' ...  As a self-employed management consultant, who is often in sales meetings, i did get value from this book and do recommend. I enjoyed it, and will definitey use some of the techniques. It's not fluff - it gives you detailed examples.
B007N8RULO|5.0|I love this game, it's so addictive ans I can't have enough of it! it runs smoothly on my kindle fire. no glitches.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I really like how you can unlock a lot of games and keep playing them even though you already unlocked them. I don't like how some of the games are super hard but some only take you 10 seconds to finish. they could at least make some games more like kid fun not like twilight
B007V5CF5K|4.0|Snark Busters is pretty good so far.  Not too easy and not too difficult.  I would recommend this game to those who like this type of puzzle game.  Works well on KF.
B0015DROBO|4.0|This book starts slow but quickly speeds up and keeps going until the very end.  You will enjoy the ride but will quickly want the second book to see what is going to happen to Salander next.
0345803485|5.0|Oh my..........goodness.  No matter what \\"adult\\" age you may be this is a fabulous book.  I have not read anything quite like this in my entire life.  I constantly blush to myself and don't read around my husband.  He would wonder what I was blushing about. If you don't read this and the other two you will be missing out.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was my favorite of the three.  I was quickly lured into loving the violence prone Mr Grey.  Unlike the first book, I felt satisfied at the end.  The pull of the story line is what held my attention.  The sex scenes were just gravy.. GOOD GRAVY.
0312983867|5.0|Over the past few weeks I've already made it through Hard Eight! Suspenseful and entertaining all while Stephanie is still confused about her love life!
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I thought this book was second best of the trilogy.  The story is wrapped up nicely and to all females' approval.  I did feel that it drug about near the end.  All in all, WONDERFUL.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|the title says all. this series is the beginning of a new adventure in the mytholigy realm. the series feels like its going to be a nice one.
B00421IR5I|5.0|Watched this multiple times, each time laughing in the same places.  A great, fun film for the family... and those that have enjoyed the Petit Nicolas books over the years.  Amusez-vous bien!
1594744769|4.0|When I started this book I was afraid it was a teenage thriller, something that would not hold my interest.  More I got into it, the story changes; from a mystery to a horror story to a series of other turns. Think TV's Grimm meets Alice in Wonderland meets Harry Potter.  I liked this book and recommend it.  I did not, however, like the ending.  The pictures in the book are great, I love antiques and thought they added to the story. Good read.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good game for killing time gets old after awhile cuz I cant unlock games and some of the games just suck but others are fun
0062101897|5.0|This thing is 13 by 10 inches, more than 500 pages thick, and weighs enough to require both hands (and will put your legs to sleep if you try to read it in your lap). It's also not cheap. But if you're a Harry Potter fan, especially of the films -- and I am -- you should buy it and have a special stand made for it in your library. Seriously, this is an amazing book and it's very easy to lose a long weekend in it. McCabe is well known as a film critic and historian, as well as a screenwriter, and it's apparent that Warner Brothers gave him full access to the \\"official\\" logs kept on the films, as well as to the actors and directors. There are a great many juicy interview quotes on a wide array of subjects. The first section takes you chronologically through the films, from making the decision to do a film when the series itself was only one-third completed and searching Britain for the three young key actors, to the last day's shooting of the last scene of the last film. They certainly lucked out in finding the three they ended up with, and who decided to stay with the whole decade-long project -- though there apparently was some hesitation partway through by Emma Watson, who feared for her education. From the beginning, they wanted to dip deeply into the pool of available British acting talent, and as the franchise showed itself a success they had no trouble finding those who wanted to participate, even for very small roles. The three key players ate it up, too. (Rupert Grint was suddenly startled to realize that, in one scene, he was alone in a room with four adult actors -- three of whom had been knighted.)<br /><br />I don't really know much about the technical processes of filmmaking (screenwriting is another matter) but I've always been fascinated by behind-the-scenes revelations. \\"How did they do that?\\" This book is a trove of inside information on costumes, props, locations, special effects, CGI, and the evolution of settings as needed for each addition to the saga -- especially the psychological nuances behind the tens of thousands of decisions that were made. The level of detail to which everyone worked is frankly  amazing, even when it's something you'll barely be aware of when you watch the films. The second section of the book provides extended discussions of all the recurring characters and the actors who played them, the large number of locations used (and when and why they decided to build a set instead of shooting on location), the magical creatures created for the films (\\"naturalness\\" was the key, even for hippogriffs), and the huge number of artifacts created by the properties department. And McCabe is also careful to describe how each new director segued from the work of the previous ones, and how the cast reacted to the changes.<br /><br />I've watched the whole series through a couple of times now: First, as each was released, then again, straight through in a marathon session. Having studied the several thousand color plates in this volume, I'm going to have to watch them again, just to spot the new things I've learned.saga -- especially the psychological nuances behind the tens of thousands of decisions that were made.

B006POGWB6|5.0|Other people have commented about the artistic qualities of this excellent movie, so I'll focus on its technical innovations.<br />Before watching Pina I did not see the point of 3D movies: why should I pay extra money to watch meatballs or jelly-o blobs flying off the screen towards me, or even worse unnaturally focused views of improbable train stations?<br /> Pina on the other hand uses 3D the same way sport broadcasters are beginning to, namely to layer a complex action scene and give you a better sense of its physicality. Kudos to Wenders for showing the way of the future to less talented directors.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|This game is lots of fun really glad I bought it u should get it u will really enjoy it.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|kindle fire: fun when I can convince it to open. accidentally already put money into it because I'm impatient. it keeps telling me I've no Internet connection after I've been all over the Internet with my browser and yes one time everything reset for two whole days! glitchy. please fix? otherwise it's a great game!
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I myself did not purchase the book, but read the first few chapters after caving in to a friend's plea for me to give the book a shot. I am glad that I did not waste the money because if I had to read another sentence where a grown woman used the phrase &#34;double crap,&#34; I was going to shoot myself. Really? Is she ten years old and therefore does not have the vocabulary to express her exasperation in any other words? It would have been fine if she had used it only once or twice, but that was not the case.This book makes my brain sad.
B00000I41J|5.0|this album was essentially Miles Davis and Friends, with Cannonball A. of course!!..i love this album i always listen to this with MD's Kind Of Blue..I love the version \\"Love for sale\\"..this is what Jazz is supposed to be. The essence of playing at the purest form, the magic it produces to people who appreciates Jazz Music! I will never get tired of listening to this. I wish there are more musicians like these guys, but sad to say these days are gone!..<br /><br />I will continue to cherish this recordings!!..love the music (JAZZ) of the 50-60's ...

0393088774|5.0|The ideas are expressed well and this ends up being a pretty quick read. If you know who Krugman is (even if you read his blog regularly) this will help you better understand some of the reasoning behind his ideas.<br /><br />If you do not currently know much about Krugman then you will get a good counterargument to those arguing for austerity.

0790729342|5.0|When i started watching the mad max movies i started with whichever one i found at the store and so i wound up going backward, starting with beyond thunder dome.  I was hooked in right then and there and i knew there was no way any other one would compare. I was wrong.  I loved Road Warrior the best. It brought something new to the plate.  I think it had a lot to do with the relationship between max and the feral kid. I love an action movie with soul. I think thats why i always loved Terminator 2 so much.  Road Warrior was like that with me.  The Mad Max movies were priceless. I hope they never re make them.

B005ONTD42|5.0|I bought this on pre-release and have to say I think people are being a little unfair about the product. I have been building my own macros on this thing, and it is very fun to program. People buy it move it back and forward and say it's rubbish. It takes practise and time to master how the ball works and the new game chromo really shows all the programmers out there what can be done with this thing. If you like gadgets and want to be part of the new wave of gadget toys buy this and start learning how it works, before sending it back, or calling it rubbish,  you might just find like I have that there is more to this gadget than a ball with flashing lights that moves back and forward with an iPhone/smart phone. Buy one and give it ago and try and programming it. You might just see as I have that there is more to this little robot ball then you first thought.

B005ZUR724|4.0|Great game despite of all the update issues. Love the details the creators put into it also the audio and sound effect are surprisingly good for something that is inexpensive. Lacks immediate customer service , takes a while for some devices to upload updates, and minor quest glitches in game but still a good game comparing to a $15 dollar a month mmo which just about has those issues as well. For a game that's still new of course there will be some road bumps at first I'm not sweating too much on the cons. I still enjoy it to the fullest~
B007LNJ4YW|5.0|...epic, capitivating and simply beautiful.  It's as close to a masterpiece as I've heard in some time and definitely worth a listen or more.
1847249442|2.0|I was sorry I wasted my time with this book.  I was drawn in by a fairly intriguing premise, melding themes from cyberpunk, contemporary hacker culture, gaming and geopolitics.  But the ideas turn out to be underdeveloped and paper thin - mere window dressing for the silly action scenes populated by cardboard characters.<br /><br />In particular, the idea of a sophisticated and distributed scripted engine, the Daemon, which is the heart of the story, is never sufficiently explored or explained.  Not only are its ultimate aims unclear, but its unfailing ability to brilliantly execute its master plan is simply absurd for a computer program we are explicitly told is not sentient and has no centralized intelligence.  Yet this hyped-up computer virus/game engine is able to choose human targets, engage in sophisticated psychological manipulations, falsify accounts, free prisoners, recruit soldiers, takeover corporations - you name it.  It is literally dues-ex-machina.  What we get instead of anything meaningful or even plausible are fantastically violent scenes of robot cars and motorbikes slashing and crushing their way towards... what again, exactly?  A new world order where nation-states are obsolete, consumer and finance capitalism is disbanded and the Daemon is in charge of the world?  Somehow?  I guess?<br /><br />The book runs about 40% too long, and gets less and less rewarding as it lumbers towards its unsatisfying quasi-conclusion.<br /><br />Perhaps the overall story improves with its culmination in Freedom, but Saurez didn't show me nearly enough to get me to follow him there.<br /><br />The sad thing is, if executed with much more skill, curiosity and restraint, the Daemon premise could have allowed him to craft an interesting and relevant story around our technology-dependent always-online consumer society.  That is not this book. But please don't think I am only disappointed because it isn't the book I wanted it to be.  I'm afraid it's just not a good one by any measure.
B0074JODEY|4.0|Many others have noted the unique place of these films in exploitation and Japanese cinema, and how fun they are.  I rented the original DVDs and watched them with the excellent Animeigo subtitles.  Unfortunately, these are the English versions, dubbed only, which is doubly frustrating for the hard-of-hearing (as far as I can tell no subtitles are available in English either).<br />As explained on their website:<br /><br />\\"Because Shogun Assassin was created by editing together LW&C 1 and 2, there are only 5 Shogun Assassin films: Shogun Assassin (LW&C 1 and 2), Shogun Assassin 2: Lightning Swords of Death (LW&C 3) and Shogun Assassin 3-5 (LW&C 4-6).<br /><br />Our release of the Shogun Assassin films uses the same high-quality masters as the LW&C films. In the case of Shogun Assassin, we took the original film and replaced each cut with the corresponding one from the HD masters.<br /><br />All the Shogun Assassin films are English-language only; there is no Japanese soundtrack or subtitles. \\"<br /><br />All that being said, while I was surprised and disappointed by the lack of the original Japanese and soundtrack, the picture is superb.  The dubbing is not that bad either, but the liner notes are accessed through \\"special features\\" rather than as an integral part of the subtitles as usual.  For compactness and picture clarity, this set gets a near excellent, but for those who would prefer original language and soundtrack, for now the only option is to stick with the DVD set, as Animeigo explains they aren't keen to do many blu ray due to the cost involved and the limited market.  Let's hope this will change for them, as I really love the way they do their subtitles.  I also hope all those who usually comment on foreign language films how they hate subtitles will make this a sold-out set, but somehow I doubt these usually vocal critics will step up to the plate.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|good but too many ads. everytime i finish a game ons pops up. that's really the only thing that drove me crazy.

B0060FXDCG|2.0|I give the writers credit for coming up with something fresh, and I even managed to stay awake through most of the first movie, but that's where my compliments end. I thought the parents were cartoonish, the transformers better actors than the humans, and I HATED how unrealistic the two female leads looked/acted over the course of the three movies. Nothing against the actresses given those parts, but I would've preferred younger, more age-appropriate actresses for these movies, the type of females teenage boys actually see at their schools -- instead of just in their fantasies.
0439023513|3.0|After having devoured the first two books, I greatly anticipated the conclusion of the trilogy.  I noted the rating of the book was lower than the other two, but wanted to know of the conclusion of this great series.<br /><br />The ratings didn't lie.  The first two books follow a similar exciting formula of participants in a gladiator arena.  The third book breaks from this and takes a great deal of time to get its feet under it.  It really isn't until the final 1/3 of the book, that the action really takes off.<br /><br />Kaitniss also spends a great deal of the book in a funk and moping through the novel.  This is very different from the frist two books that show her to be a fighter of amazing strength.<br /><br />If you've read the first two books as I had done, you can't help but want to finish the series - and I would encourage one to do so.  However, know going in that had this book been on its own and not the conclusion of the trilogy, it would be unlikely to gain much acclaim or interest.
B004UQPM4E|1.0|BUYER BEWARE! The product states that this set includes the Theatrical Edition of Superman: The Movie, but it is not what you saw in theaters. Visually, it's the theatrical edition, but aurally it is NOT! This release STILL suffers from that awful new sound mix they did that added a TON of terrible sound effects to augment the original sound effects. Anyone raised on this film, as I was, immediately can tell something is off, and it gets worse the longer the movie goes on.<br /><br />All the sound effects are overdone and in your face, whereas in the real theatrical edition the sound effects were subtle and effective. Warner Brothers has committed a travesty with this film. They re-did the sound effects for that awful Extended Edition DVD they released 12 years ago, and REFUSE to actually go back to the original master. This \\"theatrical edition\\" is an insult to the fans and the film. I honestly can not watch this film anymore, the sound effects are so bad they take you out of the movie each and every time.<br /><br />I'm sure the set is good, it seems to have a lot of stuff on it. But I refuse to pay 80 bucks for a \\"theatrical edition\\" that is not a theatrical edition. Bad enough you have to buy this whole set just in order to have the original cut, but then once you drop the money you come to find that it is in fact a dupe, a con, a lie.<br /><br />If you don't care about your Superman movie, then by all means, buy this set. But if you profess to care about the original film and its preservation as a classic, then you must boycott this set until Warners gets their heads out of their you know whats. This set does NOT include the original Superman movie, it has some DVD Bizarro must have come up with. AVOID THIS SET!
0385523912|5.0|A friend left this book with me a few months ago but I put it at the bottom of the book pile.  For some reason, I have never had much of an interest in North Korea.  I have always been more keen to learn about Chinese and Japanese history,  Two days ago, I finally decided to pick up the book.  I finished it ten minutes ago.  This book is a gripping, page turning, emotional journey that is exceedingly well written and so seamless in its weaving together of six lives.  You become caught up in the amazing personal stories of loyalty to the fanatical regime in North Korea and the individual inner turmoil about the reality of what is happening, while learning quite a bit of good information about the history of this country and where it stands now.  I feel foolish to not have  educated myself on this topic earlier.  I have read plenty of books on China's Great Leap Forward but this book was just as compelling, unique and rich with details and stories about the horribly botched Communism that continues in North Korea, to the detriment of its very own citizens.  The incredible level of research that must have gone into this is impressive- only through that level of detail and a deep commitment could the author then have woven such living, breathing portraits to make the book come to life. This is a must-read, esp now as Kim Jong-Un takes control over this trampled on country. Outstanding work.

1592402038|5.0|I have a terrible time with punctuation. I never remember learning the rules beyond the basics, such as sentences end in periods and commas go between items on lists. I have always had someone else proofread my papers for school because I am a mad comma splicer and I abuse parentheses like no other.<br /><br />Lynne was able to explain the most common rules clearly and give some good historical context about who invented those rules and why. She isn't an indurate prescriptivist either so her rules are easy to follow and tolerable. She gave excellent counterexamples that show how meanings can become ambiguous or quite different when things are not punctuated correctly.<br /><br />This book gave me the belief that I can punctuate things myself, and I love that feeling.
0345803485|3.0|Wow, am I seriously going to be able to make it through this book?  I finally caved to the pressure to read it, due to the fact that just about everyone I know has been sucked into it as well.  I am so disappointed.  I feel like I am reading something written by a teenager.  I guess if you are into such nonsensical, Harlequin-type books, it would be an interesting read.  I think what really lost it for me was when I found out Christian Grey is only 27 years old!  Give me a @#$%*&^ break!  In my mind, I was envisioning and hoping for a Don Draper or Roger Sterling from Mad Men. Need I say more?  I also find the writing extremely repetitive, and find myself \\"rolling my eyes\\" and \\"frowning\\" more and more.  With this being said, I have still committed myself to finishing this book. I really hope it improves.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|great app to pass time, addictive and fun, So far, so good. I'd say, its worth it. buy it, try it, have fun..;)
B007SYWFRM|4.0|very fun and addicting. People keep complaining about how you cant get out of it unless you shut your kindle fire off. Well, there is a solution. If you want to exit the game, all you have to do is go to the menu bar in the bottom right corner and tap it. Then tap the option Icon. Once you do this, the kindle fire menu bar will appear.

0062060562|4.0|Before I Go To Sleep is the debut novel of the British writer S. J. Watson. It is a crime thriller, and full of psychological terror.<br /><br />The protagonist of this book is Christine Lucas. Christine wakes up every morning with the memory of the last 20 years of her life erased. She does not recognize the man in her bed. She does not recognize the house she is in, nor her clothes nor even her face in the mirror.<br /><br />When her husband, Ben, wakes he explains to her that she has lost her memory as the result of a long-ago accident.  While walking, she was mowed down by a hit and run driver. It is a miracle that she survived this horrendous accident.  Before going off to work as a school teacher, Ben sows Christine some photos of their life together. When she wonders why there are so few photos, he explains that most of their belongings were lost in a fire.<br /><br />Soon after Ben leaves, a phone in Christine's pocketbook rings. It is not the cell phone that Ben has given to her (and explained how to use). On the line is Dr. Nash, a neuropsychologist who has been working regularly with Christine. He urges her to look in her diary to confirm their appointment for this day. When Christine meets Dr. Nash later, he explains that she has a form of amnesia that causes an inability to form new memories. She is barely remembering old memories as well. Dr. Nash has convinced Christine to write secretly in a journal, in an attempt to jog her memory.<br /><br />When Christine retrieves her journal from its hiding place, she notes with surprise the three words written in the front: DON'T TRUST BEN. Why did Christine write this? She is seeing Dr. Nash without the knowledge of her husband. Maybe Dr. Nash is not to be trusted. And what has happened to Christine and Ben's son, Adam? There are no photos of him, yet Christine soon remembers him.<br /><br />This is a complex and compelling novel.  It is well-written and suspenseful. An international best-seller, the movie rights have been acquired by Ridley Scott's production company. The project is \\"in development\\" as they say in Hollywood. Hopefully it will reach the big screen. This book was a great read and would make a great movie.hts have been acquired by Ridley Scott's production company.

0375842209|5.0|This book is not for everyone. Not by a long shot. It's not fast-paced (it took me an entire week to get through, which is like 5 years in book-reviewer world). It's sad. It's set during one of the darkest periods in human history. It's narrated by Death. So even though I'm about to give a positive review, you have to consider all of these things before deciding whether this is a book you want to attempt.<br /><br />That said, this was a wonderful book. It's very different from most of the YA fiction out there. The writing style almost made me feel like I was floating above the story, or dreaming it. Death views everything happening in Liesel's life calmly. Death doesn't make many judgments about what he is witnessing. He is intrigued, and sometimes feels sorry for the people he is observing, but he is mostly detached from the events. It almost gave the book a hazy feel, if that makes any sense.<br /><br />Also, since Death exists outside of our perceptions of time and space (and since he is Death), he sometimes jumps around in the narrative. A character will have something happen to him, and suddenly Death will interject his own thoughts about that character's death, sometime later. And then we'll be back in the present again. Sometimes a death is mentioned briefly early in the book, then explained fully later. Other times, Death merely alludes to the character's later death, and that's the last we ever hear of it.<br /><br />Some people find this off-putting or spoiler-ish. But seriously, everyone dies, someday. And I imagine if I was Death, I'd view people's actions through the lens of their eventual and inevitable deaths too.<br /><br />As for the human characters, I never felt like I truly knew or completely understood them, because Death doesn't fully know or understand them either. But I was able to feel them and sympathize with them. I could see many nuances and facets to each of them, but always with a slight sense of detachment. It's a hard feeling to put into words. Normally, if I don't feel fully connected with the characters, I can't enjoy a book. But the detachment in this book seemed very deliberate, instead of the author just not knowing how to make me feel connected.<br /><br />As for the plot itself, this isn't a typical Holocaust book, in that we don't ever venture into the concentration camps (with the exception of Death's haunting recollection of carrying souls away from the gas chambers) and the main character is too young to fully understand what is going on around her. Liesel's main concerns are obtaining food, reading her books, and spending time with her friends and foster parents. The main exception to this is the time spent hiding Max in the basement. But even then, Liesel is more concerned with the stories he tells and the friendship they form. She doesn't care that he is a Jew, and doesn't spend much time pondering his fate if he is ever found out.<br /><br />There's a bittersweet innocence to her story. She can go to Hitler Youth meetings, attend book burnings, and hide a Jew in her basement, but she is still largely ignorant to the horrors of the world around her. Of course, even a child can't be oblivious forever, and once the war finally comes directly to Liesel, it is hear- wrenching.<br /><br />I cried towards the end of this book. I pretty much never cry during books (I think the last time I cried was when I read The Chamber by John Grisham in 1998, and I still can't really explain that one), but I cried while reading this one. The only thing stopping me from a full-on gulping and hiccuping ugly-cry was the fact that my husband was sleeping in the bed next to me, and I didn't want to wake him up (plus, I kind of thought that if I did wake him up, he may make fun of me for crying so hard at a book. And I didn't feel like explaining why it was totally justified).<br /><br />I wasn't prepared for how hard it was going to hit me. As I mentioned before, I felt like I had gone through the bulk ofthe book as a detached observer. I didn't feel completely connected to the characters, although I didn't mind. And yet at the end, I could barely even breathe through the tears.<br /><br />The Book Thief is a story of regular people doing the best they can during a period of unspeakable evil. It's a story of Death being fascinated by life. And a story of a child being a child, in a world where innocence is a luxury few can afford.<br /><br />I thought it was beautiful.the book as a detached observer.

0375842209|4.0|Historical Fiction has never been my kind of genre. The few examples that I've read before always came off as fake, simply being a story shoehorned into the historic setting, or flimsy, where the stories only real connections to the historic event it was based was a bit of trivia here or there. The Book Thief manages to seem like it actually happened. It's a story that could only have happened in World War II. Strangely, what made it come together so well was the detached, yet empathetic tones of the supernatural Death narrating the tail of Liesel. His dark humor and unique way of storytelling help uplift the foreboding, but hopeful mood of the story.<br /> Though Zusak is primarily a Teen fiction writer, and this is very much a teen focused book, I think any reader can enjoy it. The strongest message the book gives out is one everyone can agree on because we see it every day: the power for words. It's easy to see the strength they have, and how much words have to do with Liesel's life.<br /> If it isn't already obvious, I quite like the book. What real does it for me is the power of Zusak's words. He has a flowing, easy-to-read style that's strong enough to evoke emotion. That being said, I'm not really found of Death's bold-font interjections. I'm not really sure why they couldn't have just be in the normal text, because there was plenty of Death's normal narration that could have been put into those segments. Overall, I feel death could have taken a bit more spotlight, though I have no clue how that would be possible without shattering the story and mood that was setup with having death narrate in the first place.

B0076NAWWA|3.0|This album sounds like it should be great, in theory, but the end result doesn't live up to that for reasons that others claim are it's strong points.  Some of my observations:<br /><br />- I've been a fan of both Morse's for many years and I especially enjoy everything Neal Morse has done.  I think Casey has a really good, unique voice with incredible vibrato, and he should have been the lead for the whole album.  Neal's voice and vocal style doesn't compliment Casey's well and frankly is a distraction at times.  And don't get me started on Portnoy's overly-processed vocals... why hasn't he realized yet that he can't sing?  They hired a fully capable vocalist, let him sing.<br /><br />- \\"All Falls Down\\" is one of the worst songs on the album.  No one involved in this project could have done the vocals justice, it should have been an instrumental.  \\"Kayla\\", \\"Everything Changes\\", and \\"Better Than Walking Away\\" are the best tracks in my opinion.  Everything just came together real well for those songs in particular.  \\"Fool In My Heart\\" should have been a studio outtake from a future Neal Morse solo album.<br /><br />- The guitars are too prominent in the mix and overshadow the bass.  The drums are also EQ'd badly, the bass drums are too far back and the cymbals aren't crisp, which is unusual for anything I've heard Portnoy play on.  I think Steve Morse was the stand-out musician on this album.<br /><br />Overall it's a fairly good album that could have been great with more planning and better production/engineering.
0316154687|5.0|Having started my \\"Sedaris trip\\" with \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day,\\" which I think is the funniest of all his books, I did not get that much laugh out of this book. Yet, I thoroughly enjoyed \\"When You Are Engulfed in Flames.\\" Many of the stories included here seem to have more layers than the \\"laugh-out-loud quirky episodes/observations plus ending with a touch of pathos\\" patterns you see a lot in \\"Me Talk Pretty One Day.\\" Mind you, these added layers may often border on grotesque and strange. \\"He is changing his style,\\" is what I thought for a while. Then I came to realize that this is Mr.Sedaris revealing more of himself, or being truer to himself, as he originally tried in some of his short stories in \\"Barrel Fever.\\" I'm now more of a Sedaris fan because of this book. I only hope that he will strike the right balance in all his future endeavors in being a popular author and being a true artist.
B0083GR6Y6|2.0|There are much better written review's, so I'll just keep it short.  I was expecting a survival movie, which I got, but I totally agree with others that the idiocy of the chain of events is just so very hard to ignore.  Tried to watch and get into the feeling and emotion of men and God....but then the wolves would come back and I couldn't do anything but shout at the TV \\"A wolf wouldn't do that!!\\"  Not the greatest...
B001I8A76A|5.0|I could listen to this over and over all day long. I love this album, and it always makes me feel better when i crank it up on my phone:)!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I enjoyed the first book and was \\"forced\\" to buy the second book to see what happens between Ana and Grey. This sequel was less exciting for me.  Yes, there was the same plot.  Should Ana continue a relationship with the mentally screwed up Grey.  And then the exes show up with their heated jealously.  But there was too much sex.  And Ana and Grey's feelings towards each other were too corny by the second half of the book.  But if you like lots of sex and corny love stories, then this is the book for you.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Adam I love your new CD.  This is the new bridge thru the generations.  The old mixed with the new makes wonderful music.  I love all the songs and listen all day long.  It is wonderful to excercise too.  You are a genius with great vocal skills...I am a fan for life and you make me want to listen to music again....thank you......
B007J4T2G8|5.0|WOW!  When I first started reading book one, I thought to myself...I don't know if I can read this.  I like the story line to be a little lighter, more \\"fun\\", and turn out \\"happy\\".  It wasn't too much further into the first book that I realized that this was going to turn out just fine.  I found it riveting and definitely one that couldn't be put down!  I finished all three books of the trilogy in 1-1/2 weeks!  My husband certainly enjoyed the fact that I read this trilogy as well!<br /><br />The down or negative side....there is no book 4!!  What ever do you read now?  How do you find something to compare?

B005J3IEZQ|5.0|This is the most detailed episode that dictates what kind of person he was and how the Apple was established.<br />I am an electronics engineer so it is very fascinating to find that the Apple II was the first one which installed a switching power supply. Who knows this kind of thing?<br /><br />This book is the masterpiece in terms of the Apple's birth and modern computer electronics history.
B005LAIIRQ|5.0|ok. this is my first review of any kind here. but reading the reader comments compelled me to write something. some of you people gave this film a one or two star rating? really? what were you expecting? shakespere with an r rating? this is one of the finest adventure films to come around in quite a while. i would recomend this movie to anyone. take it for what it is, a really good, supenseful adventure film.

0345803485|1.0|So here's the good: I like it when a story can begin at the beginning and end at the end. And for this novel, it pretty much does that.<br /><br />I also like it when a story can be told in a first person narrative--sometimes when a story goes into a third person narration, I'll feel like does the author REALLY need to tell me the story or can they just let their characters 'speak' for themselves.<br /><br />Well, I needn't worry about that in this story, so I can check that off the list too.<br /><br />I think it's also nice when an author can expand their story's vocabulary to include words that maybe their audience (or really ME) isn't always so familiar with. Check for these words: situ (pg. 343 paragraph 6)--is this even a word? My 'spell check' is giving me a wiggly red line?<br /><br />Moving on, you will also find the words:** syllabud, contravenes, envisaged, loquacious, largesse, torpor, and vouchsafed.<br /><br />Having mentioned these, all I'm left with is why, oh WHY then would this same author resort to overusing words and phrases like: his mouth formed into a hard line, fire up the old mean machine, holly cow, jeez, murmur, mutter, snorts, beams (as a verb), clasps (as a verb too), grasps and so on.<br /><br />A lot of these words and phrases were just done to death. And then it would be like the author would be on a roll: like with the word 'murmur'. Because Ana would murmur and then Christian would murmur and it would just go back and forth with this whole round of murmurs. (This was just done too much.)<br /><br />And it became very bothersome too. Because the author was NOT using any variety in her word choices. If anything, it was like an exercise (an AWFUL) exercise of the sameness.<br /><br />Especially with the vocabulary that the author had at their disposal--again, please see the above **.<br /><br />Also, it got to me that Christian had to be sooo BEAUTIFUL. His beautiful face, his long beautiful fingers, the way he walked and so on. For me, this added up to one big BORING. Like only 'beautiful' people deserve to be rich and powerful and whatever? This again is BORING.<br /><br />Christian himself to me was boring. I feel like he had absolutely NOTHING going on for himself. I mean, does this guy like to rock climb, ski, go scuba diving? What?<br /><br />Oh yeah, he IS a pilot. Only to me, that only served to show off his wealth. (Wealth folks, doesn't always show great character or make for an interesting person.)<br /><br />And the thing with Christian being into the whole Domination/Submissive thing added up to one big EWW for me. And it's ALL because of HOW he got into this lifestyle to begin with.<br /><br />I mean, how powerful is Christian supposed to be when you learn that when he was ONLY 15 he had a 'relationship' (if you can even call it that???) with a friend of his mother who turned him on to this type of Dom/Sub lifestyle in the first place.<br /><br />This to me is WRONG! (And creepy too!!!)<br /><br />If the author HAD to go there with all this 'Dom/Sub' stuff, then why oh WHY couldn't Christian have been introduced to this stuff by say his golfing buddy or something?<br /><br />I mean, believe it or not when adults introduce OTHER adults to things of this nature, I would hardly have a problem with it. Because I would know going in, that the person pretty much knew what they were getting themselves into. (And trust me, that's not always the case even if you ARE an adult.)<br /><br />But what do you think a 15 year old is supposed to do and feel when introduced into this kind of 'lifestyle' at that age?<br /><br />It just...I mean, it's no wonder Christian was all too eager to get Anastasia on board with all this 'tie me up/tie me down' nonsense. (And I wouldn't even bother call it 'nonsense' if Christian had been introduced to this activity as an adult.) Only he wasn't and that's a call that the author of the story made. Honestly, this part of the story could've been fixed. Oh well!<br/><br />Also it was the whole thing with the title. I'm thinking with a title like 'Fifty Shades of Grey', that the character would've been, I don't know? An older man. Say someone maybe 50?<br /><br />Only that's not the case at all. Christian's practically a kid (I'm sorry, but when you're someone my age, 27 is like a kid.) And for someone that age, it didn't really ring true that he could already have his own business that employs hundreds if not thousands of employees. (I know this kind of thing just happens all the time--but he could've at least been into software development, this guy I think manufactures (something?) And he's NEW money no less!!! This is just TOO out there to believe.<br /><br />I mean, if this were to be made into a movie, Justin Timberlake would be too old to play Christian!  Does anyone know what I'm talking about? Because the character Christian Grey is drawn WAY older than 27, so what would've been the harm in making him older?  This to me, making Christian an older man--think somebody like George Clooney folks, would've rang a WHOLE lot truer. This (his young age) was such a missed mark I can't even tell you.<br /><br />Moving on, enter the picture Anastasia Steele. She's a real sweetheart--this CLOSE to graduating college and a vastly sparse wardrobe to match her barely scraping by budget.<br /><br />Ana gets to meet Christian because her college roommate is sick and can't make her pre-arranged meeting to interview him.<br /><br />Well, without giving anything away, Mr. Grey becomes taken with Ana and they start a relationship. (The whole thing becomes so one-sided, I'm not even sure that I'd call it a relationship.)<br /><br />OK, I'm just going to come out with it: The whole Dom/Sub thing really bothered me. And I don't like that Ana was a virgin going into all this. I mean, when Christian tells her (in so many words) that her virginity is something that he has to do something about, I was really put off. Like it was his 'job' or something? And where's the romance in that?<br /><br />WHERE was the ROMANCE in this novel? I mean, because of Christian's screwed up background (that's only slightly touched on) [I guess that's what the other books in the series are for], Ana can't even really touch Christian--that's where the whole Dom/Sub stuff comes in. That's WHY I guess it has to come in.<br /><br />I mean, I don't like hitting and pain and I would NEVER equate these things to romance.<br /><br />Buying people cars and Mac Books and Blackberrys (Why it wasn't an iPhone, I'll never know?) doesn't equate to romance to me.<br /><br />Christian Grey was a dominating jerk that got screwed up (poor thing) LONG before he met Anastasia.<br /><br />The only good thing is how this books ends. Ana gets...(well, I won't give EVERYTHING away!!!)<br /><br />And besides, if the whole thing REALLY ended the way I wanted it to, there wouldn't be a need for the other two books!!!<br /><br />To all those who are STILL busting at the seams to get this...well, NOVEL, you were warned!!!<br /><br />Me, I'm done!!!  :  {
067144901X|3.0|Of the four Boynton books my son received for his birthday, this is the only one that may be spared from the trash can. The illustrations are okay, not great. The book is the standard, \\"cow says, 'moo'. Sheep says, 'baa'\\" book, with the one CONFUSING exception of some singing pigs, followed by oh, wait, no, no, no, pigs say 'oink'. This is also the only one of the four books with a pretty good ending, the animals ask \\"what do you say?\\". Pretty cute ending, that's what might save it in our house, but the rest of the book is just on the low end of okay.
1594744769|4.0|The tricky part about reading a Kindle book is that if you're not careful you finish a book before you realize it.  I found myself so thoroughly engrossed in this book that I entirely forgot to keep an eye on the progress meter at the bottom of my page so when I turned the page to get into the meat of a great adventure, I was instead greeted with the assurance that all the photos in the novel were actual found photos.<br /><br />WHAT??<br /><br />But the adventure had just begun!  So here's the deal.  I don't need everything tied up in a neat package when I finish a book but something left with such a huge adventure ahead surely needed just a tiny bit of hope that the story would be continued.  A phrase \\"to be continued\\" - an actual excerpt from the next in the series - just something to let me know that we'll finish this adventure.  It's such a tremendous set-up for a series that I really hope it continues.  I'll be first in line to buy book 2.<br /><br />I would like to add that it's still a great kindle book - you don't get the full effect of the photos on a traditional keyboard kindle like I have but the ability to download kindle to your PC or tablet or whatever makes that a non-issue.  I just opened it up on my other devices and looked at the pictures after the fact to get a better look at them.

B007J4T2G8|2.0|the first couple of chapters started off interesting, but then it became obvious and apparent that the story was pretty much in a nutshell: 'oh my - don't bite your lip - he's so hot - mr.grey - mrs.steele - like icarus flying too close to the sun - i like to punish you - don't punish me - am i worthy - i want to control - sex scene, sex scene - argument - i can't do this - but he's so hot i'll do anything for him - murmurs - frowns - rolling eyes - biting lips - mouth set in a hard line - sex scene, sex scene - jeez - holy crap - oh my'<br />OH MY GOD JEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEZ snoooooooore! ugh i'm upset i wasted money on this! there is no story whatsoever. the characters although are supposed to be complicated, Christian Grey with his dark tormented past, and Ana Steele who's a smart (really?) girls albeit a virgin with no sexual experience.<br />First of all - the fact that Ana was merely 21/21 kinda lost my interest - but i guess the author would've had to explain how she's a virgin if she'd have been any older. The fact the Christian is a twisted S&M billionaire is creepy as hell - who care how greek god hot he is? Ana is a spineless character with no opinions or convictions of her own. her entire thought process is, 'he's so hot, how can he be attracted to me, i need to be with him, what if he hurts me, i don't want to do that but i'll do it for his pleasure' she's so weak it's annoying. she can't stand up for herself, she just sits there like a battered house-wife and indulges him while he controls and orders her around. i realize some girls may be like that BUT why the heck would i want to read about it in a book/story? it's boring! and since there's not much of a story, the reader has to rely on the characters to offer substance to the book, but since the characters are all kinds of fifty shades of gray (pun intended) - this makes for a very boring and underwhelming book.<br />Christian's character is equally annoying as he narrows his eyes, frowns, orders, controls, snaps, blah blah blah - yeah yeah, we get it, he's an alpha male with a dark past......and yet his character is just stuck and the same repetitive actions and sex scenes. there's no story - except that he wants to control and like inflicting pain on Ana who he supposedly cares about (he's 27 years old - but still stuck in a dark teenage past?!).<br />i didn't even want to finish this book it was so repetitive and i was so bored of sex scenes between a weak-minded girl and a controlling alpha-male, i don't care how hot he is. the only reason why i finished the book was because i paid $11 for it. i didn't miss anything if i'd not finished it half-way through. i have no desire or interest to read the rest of the trilogy.....SNORE! it's not like i'll miss anything.<br />it really does remind me of twilight except with graphic sex. same boring characters and lame, tired story. i've only read the first of the twilight series and couldn't care less what happened. surely this is the same.<br /><br />ironically, fifty shades of grey, sums up how the characters and story are...gray...and vanilla ('gasp, oh my!') a big MEH!
0671449028|1.0|I cannot understand the popularity of this author, my son received four of her books for his birthday and none of them are up to par for a children's book.<br /><br />This particular one is by far the most confusing. The illustrations are okay, not more than that. It is very confusing to small children that the animals are \\"going below\\" as they are unfamiliar with the constructs of a large boat or ship. This could be overlooked, perhaps. But the final activity that the animals participate in - after taking a bath, putting on pajamas, and brushing their teeth - is exercise! Any doctor will tell you that exercising before bed is a bad idea, for a number of reasons. This is confusing to children, because they often like to emulate books, especially books that are meant to teach or reinforce to them how to perform a specific activity. This one however MASQUERADES AS A GUIDE FOR CONDUCTING NIGHTLY ABLUTIONS, it is nothing of the sort.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|the fifty shades trilogy is a clever read, drawing people in because of the strong sexual attraction between christian and ana, and the graphic and out-of-the -ordinary sex it describes, which becomes secondary to the well developed personalities of the characters. but the book is also a powerful love story which examines what frustrations we all experience as we try to attain true intimacy with another person. and, the author leads us in a circle so that at the end of the trilogy, as i read christian's alternative account of his meeting with ana, i wanted to go back to the beginning and re-read ana's description.and, reading christian's account of his tormented childhood, i could go back and understand some of his actions, which earlier, had me wondering if he was a villain, which also took some rereading for me to decide.( NOT!) fortunately, i have all three books on my kindle! i am looking forward to the movie, and i hope ms. james decides to write again. great suspense.....great descriptions of seattle. had i listened to some of my friends who dismissed this as \\"smut\\", i would have missed out on a great read.
0684859106|1.0|Every recipe I've tried has been a little off.  I'm not an expert baker, but it almost tastes like a lot of these recipes call for too much flour, or maybe the ingredient proportions are just off.  Everything ends up with a \\"powdery\\" flour taste and texture.  So far, I've made a few cakes and a batch of blondies. All were below average, in my opinion. The icing mixes were ok, though.  I won't be trying anything else from this book. Luckily it was a gift so I didn't spend money on it.
B004IQMXD4|3.0|I love Stevie Nicks I have always been a big fan.  I love the song Annabel Lee, I can listen to it all day, it's brilliant. IMO it's worth buying the CD for that song.  However, none of the other songs really stand out to me.  I enjoy a few of the other songs but I think she just needed someone else to help with the production, her voice is great on it. I am not really \\"wowed\\" by the songs where I want to play over and over again.  Maybe she should collaborate with Sheryl Crow again, bet they could really come up with some great songs for Stevie's voice. Having said that, Stevie Nicks can't really do any \\"wrong\\" in my book, her voice is forever great, I enjoy listening to anything she sings and I hope she will come out with more new songs in the near future.
B007PS0X0W|1.0|I was really wanting to watch this and within the first 5 min i could see that it was on a downward spiral, the effects are subpar and the story is loose at best. I'm guessing they plan on another show by the way this ended but I couldn't say i would go watch it, or even rent it due to how bad this one was. Not giving details just in case you do rent it, but i will say this it is very disapointing.

As someone who has generally followed the Esselstyn approach spelled out in Prevent and Reverse Heart Disease: The Revolutionary, Scientifically Proven, Nutrition-Based Cure, this book resonated strongly with me. I am going to follow the one week test plan to the letter for the next week on a trip to New Mexico, and see how hard it is to apply in practice.<br /><br />For other's sitting on the fence, Dr. McDougall has given you a simple test to see if it is for you.<br /><br />1. Eat more starch. Eat as much starch as you like. Don't go hungry.<br /><br />2. Choose the least processed foods you can find -- for example, brown not white rice, whole grains not flour, etc.<br /><br />3. Eat plenty of fruits and vegetables.<br /><br />4. Eliminate all animal foods, including meat, poultry, fish, eggs, milk and cheese.<br /><br />5. Keep fat intake low; nuts and seeds only as treats.<br /><br />6. Avoid all added fats including butter, margarine, vegetable oil, even olive oil.<br /><br />7. If you eat soy, use only minimumly processed soy; avoid any modified ones like soy milk, tofu, etc.<br /><br />8. Go easy on sugar and salt but don't worry about them very much -- add only to the surface of foods.<br /><br />Two hints:<br /><br />A. Avoid temptation by keeping unhealthy foods out of your house.<br /><br />B. Prepare or purchase healthy foods you enjoy so they are always present, especially when you are in a hurry.<br /><br />Choose from these foods:<br /><br />Starches:<br /><br />Grains: Barley, buckwheat, chia, corn, millet, oats, rice, rye, sorghum, wheat, wild rice.<br /><br />Legumes: Beans, lentils, peas.<br /><br />Starchy vegetables: Carrots, Jerusalem artichokes,. parsnips, potatoes, salsify, sweet potatoes, winter squash -- acorn, banana, butternut, Hubbard -- yams<br /><br />Green, Yellow and Orange -- non-starchy vegetables and fruits<br /><br />Vegetables: Bok choy, broccoli, Brussels sprouts, cabbage, cauliflower, celery, chives, collard greens, eggplant, garlic, green beans, kale, leeks, lettuce, mustard greens, okra, onions, peppers, radishes, rhubarb, scallions, spinach, summer squashes, turnips, zucchini.<br /><br />Fruits: Apples, apricots, bananas, berries, cherries, figs, grapefruit, grapes, loquats, mangoes, melons, nectarines, oranges, papayas, peaches, persimmons, pineapples, plums, tangerines, watermelon<br /><br />***<br /><br />There is a Menu Plan, but I am not going to use that since I'll be travelling.

B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This series is a very poignant portrayal of post-apocalyptic America.  It captures you from the first page and you cannot put it down after that.  The love triangle also keeps you guessing throughout the series and although I did not guess the outcome, it didn't disappoint.  If I can say anything negative, it is that the 3rd book dragged a bit, leaving me to wonder if the 3 book series could have been condensed to 2 longer books.  But overall the series was very enjoyable...any author that can bring their reader from laughter to tears to shock, anger, and grief is a great writer.
B000ID1J40|3.0|An excellent story line for a movie of it's time. It does drop the F bomb once and several other profanities throughout. It also has a scene where a woman starts to strip off her clothes... If it didn't have those two pieces then this would be a 4.5 star movie. Too bad they had to insert that garbage.
1595822003|4.0|The book is gorgeous from cover to cover.  The binding doesn't feel terribly strong for so heavy a book, but it hasn't fallen apart yet...
B007V2UGPE|5.0|it is great a very fun game a a a fun run fun game a a a a a a
B006ON41FC|5.0|I llove this game! I hats spending money but this game was totally worth it I love it.you should buy thole app
B004DLPXAO|1.0|No matter what I do I cannot GET THIS APP to work.  After entering phone number and clicking on GO then nothing happens.  SAME nothing happens when I enter phone number!! What gives???
B007L3BMGA|5.0|This book had me turning the pages and wanting to know what happens in the end.<br />Couldn't put it down and then ordered the other 2 in the trilogy and read them in no time!<br />Drama, romance and a lot of naughty stuff too but thoroughly enjoyable.<br />If this is what they call mommy-porn then I'm all in!
B008469DGY|5.0|Whether you're kicking a football or rugby ball through goalposts or tossing paper wads into trashcans, &#34;flick&#34; games are great for mindless entertainment when you have a few minutes to spare. &#34;Flick Golf&#34; is one of the best and most challenging flick games that I've played on my Kindle Fire. There are several golf courses with some very scenic but challenging holes. This is not a conventional video golf game, however. You only get one shot on each hole, and you're basically trying to ace the hole, or at least trying to get the ball within a scoring ring. The closer your ball to the hole, the more points you score. At all costs, avoid the water and the sand, since there are big penalties for landing there.<br /><br />I liked the amount of ball control you have, including applying a fade or draw, and using backspin. The wind is a factor on some holes, so you have to account for it in your shot. The courses have to be unlocked with a minimum score on the previous course, so you might have to play some courses several times to achieve a winning score and advance to the next course.<br /><br />There are three different modes you can play: Quickshot, World Tour, and Quickshot Pro. They're similar to each other, but Quickshot is a short timed game, which is ideal when you only have a few minutes.<br /><br />With gorgeous color graphics and very simple gameplay, &#34;Flick Golf&#34; is easily my favorite game of this type, definitely a notch above other flick games that I've tried. And now I'm hooked on playing it until I get a hole in one (I've been sooooo close).
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its not to fun took a little while to get used  to having to click the ? button to find out how to play each game but its a fun pass time if your bored
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Cool game! It helps pass the time. It deff. adds a twist to the old original version. Too bad it takes so long to get energy though.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|As a writer, I do know the difference between what's well-written and what isn't. Obviously, if I can't stop reading to go get food- it's an awesome book. I read the reviews and decided against it, but upon mentioning it to my friends- they all said i needed to read it and that it was fantastic. I bet my ten bucks on it, and they were right! It's exciting, scary, gripping, and so many other things all in one. I did find myself skipping paragraphs just to get to the good parts, and there were some fillers, but I don't regret the purchase.<br /><br />Don't hesitate!
B007SYWFRM|4.0|I have had lots of fun making my ville. some stuff is confusing like I don't understand the piranah game but that's okay
0345803485|2.0|I will say this novel achieved what I am sure it's initial intention was. Considering it is just a gutted and re-tooled fanfic that was ousted from a Twilight forum, you can't blame the author for expressing vicariously, all her sexual fantasies about her favorite fictional characters. She had to change the obvious copyright infringements and thus was born a new plot with outrageously unrealistic protagonists (Self-made billionaire 26 year old? Mark Zuckerberg anyone?), not one being a vampire. As seen in the Twilight stories, she does keep the convention of repetitiously focusing on the mouth movements of characters, i.e pursing or biting of the lips. I am happy for the author's success in the way I am happy for anyone who is able to spawn success from something they are passionately consumed by, albeit something born from the fantasy of another writer. This book is a good novelty for a type of sexually frustrated middle aged woman who really does not care about substance or plot, most of whom are the primary devourers of the book. It is in no way a classic, and at the end of the day is just a really hardcore Harlequin novel. If \\"The Story of O\\" is filet minion, then \\"Fifty Shades of Grey\\" is potted meat.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|love the search features.  I wish there were an in app Google search for words in the text.  I love the speed of flipping.g from book to book.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|my daughter loves this game.  there is a short scrat video she enjoys, in particular, as well as a kung fu scrat mini game.  you have to be careful they don't buy add-ons.
0345803485|1.0|Don't believe the hype.  This is a horribly written book.  Was there even an editor?  I've read better erotica on the back of a cheerios box.  I'm out of my 7 day return window, but I've asked Amazon for a refund anyway.  I can't even be bothered to finish the first book, so I have already deleted all three from my kindle.<br /><br />Update:<br />Thank you Amazon!  Even though I was past the 7 day return window, they processed a refund for all of the books for me.  I love Amazon!  Customer Service is A+.
B0063IH60K|5.0|It is a free solitaire game that works great on my Kindle Fire! There is nothing not to like here, unless you don't like solitaire!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|Heard the hype and bought the book, disappointed and not worthe the $9.99. Just another book where the woman is smart, pure and can't walk and chew gum at the same time. She meets a handsome, filthy rich man and he sweeps her away from having a life. She hides her love life from her best friends and family and leads a secret life where he controls her. Sound familiar or just a spin-off from another four book franchise? Stopping at book one and now it's back to looking for free kindle books. Not worth buying books 2 & 3. As far as the hype - read or listen to Dr. Laura on Sirius and take her advice!
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book is unlike anything I've ever read before.  I could not put it down although the story haunted me.  Very, very well written from a most unique point of view.
B007EC27QM|5.0|this is perfect for kindle fire. key pad is large and easy to use. also the memory feature is a plus. plus of was free with fire
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I love this game as much as the original Quell. It has more challenges. The music is perfect for clear thinking.
B006MVJ2L4|3.0|What a mess...the vocals are great, most of the songs are good but a lot of the music is awful...his first CD is better.
0385534639|5.0|This book was the perfect escape when I read it.  It was like being in a magical romantic dream, and i found the characters, from children to very old, to be intriguing and likable. There was magic and romance and excitement and wonderment. I was leant the book and liked it so much that I bought this one as a gift for a recipient who also enjoyed it.
B006JPS1OM|4.0|This is a great game if you love a hidden object game with a story line, so far it's very enjoyable. Definatly a game worth the money!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|not a bad app for passing the time most games are not that difficult but u run out of points fast
B005I6EU7U|5.0|I love this cover, my husband takes it to church and everywhere with him, it is very classy looking. Has a nice feel to it. Not cheap or childish looking.
B00005K3O4|5.0|It's one of her favorite movies so it was the perfect gift. Arrived on time and in brand new condition.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game is awesome. I really enjoyed the original Oregon Trail, so I decided to download this one and I haven't been disappointed yet. The only flaw I would give this game is the energy concept.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|This game is very,  very similar to Super mario. In this one instead of getting a fire flower and throwing fireballs you find acorns and throw those. I rate this 4 stars because it's just a little hard to control,  but besides that this game is really fun and recommended to all Super Mario fans.
B001F7MSG6|5.0|Shipped and arrived in my mailbox when i expected it to, perfect quality, no freezing or anything. THIS MOVIE IS AMAZING!!!!! If you found the first one kind of slow, then watch this one. This one has more action and more intensity. The best part is that, unlike Spider-man in Spider-man 3, *SPOILER* both Hellboy and Abe talk about the women they have fallen for and do not look weak!!! They show true love in this film, and true epicness, and good humor!!! 6/5
B003Y3H0C6|5.0|thanks for the product Cross Women Adrina Strappy is good commend them for their work one hundred percent recommended amazon happy day greetings
B002MQYOFW|4.0|I didn't know what the hype was about and I'm not into the vampire stuff (doesn't the title kind of sound like those other vampire stories?) - so I was pretty sure this was something I wouldn't care for but, after reading the synopsis (no mention of vampires!) I thought I'd give it a go.  Glad I did, it was very enjoyable!  In fact, I've now read the entire trilogy!
B003O86FMW|4.0|I couldn't agree more with all the hype about this triology.  Written for teens, they say? It is a pretty grown up book overall.  Maybe a bit far reaching at times, in that it is somewhat 'Star Treky'.  All that aside, the good guys usually win like they are supposed to since the beginning of the Old West movies, etc. It is entertaining, to say the least, but not too thought provoking.  Our Heroine is a tough, modern female and that part I liked very much.  It is a good role model for the teenage girls of today.  Hope to see more by this author.
B003WUYQSW|5.0|[[ASIN:0061914177 Crush It!: Why NOW Is the Time to Cash In on Your Passion]]<br />My hats off to Gary. He shows a complete understanding of the why and how's to get your message out through the Social Medium. Book was an easy and fun read AND MOST IMPORTANT is loaded with information every business needs to excel using Social Media. Thanks Gary.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|truly awesome puzzle game, very addictive.  Makes you use that other 80% of your brain!  Hope Fallen Tree<br />is working on MORE great games
B007ZTLLMK|1.0|THIS STUPID APP ONLY WONT WORK FOR ME BECAUSE IT CAN INLY MOVE UP AND DOWN I WANT MY 0.99 back!!!!!
B0073Q0DZG|1.0|Not sure what movie the other reviewers are giving rave reviews about and giving four stars cause its definitely not The Big Year. This movie was horrible. I rented it based on the high ratings and \\"pleasant surprises\\" everyone was boasting about and was more than disappointed. Nothing funny about this movie. Save your 3.99.
B007XKEY6Q|4.0|I liked it but it didn't want to load so I down loaded the app again well see what happens
0345803493|5.0|Hi, i'm from Uruguay Southamerica and i've already read the three books twice, hehe, and i think they are awesome in so many ways! The characters, their stories, the unexpected events, the amaizing world of glamour and aventorous life, totally loved it, i'm single now and Christian Grey is an XXIst century charming prince, with a pretty dark side obviously, hehe, but pretty exciting and very open to improve himself wich is great. He is an amaizing character and with a strong woman to refrain him every time he cross a line is the perfect combination. I enjoyed it so much!! Now i have such a high standard to find my match in real life, hehe, i mean, is so hard to find and intelligent, acommplished, handsome, gentleman this days, they are all gay! (who are great but not to marry if you are a girl, hehe) Where is the ulltimate hot heterosexual man? Who knows, hehe. Recently i found this new concept \\"übersexual\\" and i think is very similar to the Christian Grey character, thank god, the metrosexual is over!! hehe.<br />As you probably have noticed english is not my first language so i've probably missed 10% of the magic of the book so i'm very anxious about the spanish version of the books, i'll buy at least 2 copies of each book to give them as presents to my friends and mom, hehe.<br />I'm very excited about the movie and really crossing my fingers to see this story in an HBO miniserie production, i think they would really make justice of its essence.<br />Waiting for news about the film, regards from southamerica, Fernanda!
B007SGM084|5.0|This was an absolutely wonderful story! Vividly detailed, and a captivating story line, E L James definitely out did herself! This trilogy was addictive, and extremely hard to put down. I can't wait to read more of her work.
0060873027|1.0|This book was started by Crichton before his death, upon his death it was taken up by another author. I've read several Crichton books, and this really didn't feel like one. It started out just like I would expect, but the characters quickly lost their interest to me, and the reactions seemed so unrealistic to me that I was completely taken out of the story. I am sure that if Crichton had been able to finish the book, this would not have been the case, he is excellent at character development. This book was so terrible at it that I can only suggest that Preston was responsible for a large section of the novel.
B00846F1YW|4.0|l enjoyed this game very much.  l also liked the fact that the entire screen was visible at all times.
1400069289|5.0|There's an old saying that goes, \\"Beware thoughts, for they become our words. Beware words, for they become our actions. Beware actions, for they become our habits. Beware habits, for they become our character.\\" Our habits drive the trajectory of our lives to an extent that most people don't realize. This book will help readers realize the extent, recognize their own habits, analyze how those habits were formed, and, most importantly, learn how to modify or change their habits in ways that will have a dramatic impact on their lives. Duhigg illustrates the power of habits by including stories of individual triumphs, case studies from neuroscience, and examples of how large corporations collect and analyze data on the habits of their customers to learn surprisingly personal details about them without those customers never even knowing they have been studied. As academic as all that may sound, Duhigg's style makes this book easy and entertaining to read. It's the greatest book on habits since \\"The 7 Habits of Highly Effective People.\\" In fact, whether or not that was his intention, Duhigg's \\"The Power of Habit\\" is a powerful companion piece to Covey's global best seller. This reviewer's advice is to read both. They will change your life.

B00631VJMI|5.0|The quality of the album is great.  The sound is exactly as I hoped.  The limited edition gives you a vinyl that is a picture, so that is pretty cool.
0307719774|5.0|i LOVE THIS PRODUCT! its so easy to use and helps me journal everyday which is very important!

B000PDYVVG|1.0|I wish I could call this unutterable crap.  As someone has, unfortunately, uttered it, however, I guess I'll just have to stick with straight 'crap'.  Spoiled, self-absorbed rich girl, incapable of introspection, tours the planet feeling sorry for herself and finds happiness and true love. Had this been fiction, it would never have been published. I am ashamed to share a gender and a country with this woman and I hope the rest of the world has the wisdom to perceive that she does not represent our cultural values.

0345803485|5.0|So glad to have found this trilogy on Amazon in used/perfect condition... to date 4 people have read this 1st one in less than a months time!!  We are all moving on to the other 2- LOVE USED BOOKS THAT ARE LIKE BRAND NEW!!!
B00723NWJE|5.0|First of all, I must admit that I review the music, not CD itself. I purchased this album though one of the download services (not Amazon).<br />Second, I was generally very pleased by the early albums of Norah Jones, including the soft and calm style of songs and the way her voice was sounding. I think her voice is great for that kind of songs. However, in my personal opinion, after a few successful albums, Norah is trying to move on, and do something different. \\"The Fall\\" was not that soft and sweet as \\"Come away with me\\" or \\"Feels Like Home\\". Now, we see another advancement, \\"Little Broken Hearts\\". It is different Norah Jones.<br />The new album has a few songs with more energy, dynamics...aggression. It appears to me that not only the booklet, but also the music was stylized to somewhat retro style. Despite the change, I do like this album and I do not regret the money spent. It is something different but at the same time so familiar. I caught myself listening to these songs much more frequently than I anticipated initially. If you have doubts, search for a few songs on youtube to get the taste of it.<br />My only regret is that Amazon offers only MP3 quality as the download option.  FLAC would be appreciated.
B001BPJJ9G|5.0|Only once in every generation of filmmakers, there appears such a wildly passionate love letter to the magical mystery powers of The (capital C) Cinema. Tarsem Singh's insanely idiosyncratic phantasmagoria The Fall makes such justly celebrated films as Day for Night, The Stuntman and most recently, The Artist look pale and languid by comparison.<br /><br />The cinematography in The Fall is as dazzling as any you'll see, and keep in mind there's zero cgi slight of hand. It all happens in the camera on gloriously color-saturated film. If you are a filmmaker yourself, you've got to grimace imagining what that crew endured to maintain something resembling continuity when a single sequence can stretch across three continents from locations in South Africa to Jodhpur, The Blue City of Rajasthan, onward all over India, China and beyond to include Buddha and Allah and Krishna only know whatever other ultra-exotic locales snagged Tarsem's huge and generous heart in a total of eighteen (or more!) countries.<br /><br />It's an extravagantly ambitious feat of seriously hard work by a cast and crew who clearly loved the movie every bit as much as Tarsem, who, by the by, prefers just his first name. Plus, if you know the film business at all, you'll appreciate that Tarsem has got to be a shaman with some serious ju-ju to have successfully persuaded somebody to keep signing the checks to bring this wild, unruly movie across the finish line after he'd already turned his own pockets inside out.<br /><br />Astonishing work, everyone! Bravo!
B003O86FMW|5.0|Was caught up in the story line immediately, author was very creative and reasearched medical issues and medications well. Wanted to know what was happening before I got to the next page, author excellant in making you turn the pages. Hard to put down.
B006KX3GXO|5.0|its the best photo editing app ive found so far has sooo many choices I just don't like the ads but besides that it is the best one ive found for the kindle fire
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this app is pretty fun. there's lots of games to play as the name implies the thing is that you have to earn so many points before you can unlock anymore games. I'm at the point where I have to wait days before I can get any new games and I think that's complete b.s.
B000HKWDTO|5.0|There's really very little that needs to be said.  This, just like most of the other Star Trek episodes, is exactly what fans expect from the original series.  Yes, in Star Trek: The Next Generation and later series the graphics and special effects are better, but with the exception (in my opinion) of Next Generation, you won't find consistently good story lines the way you do in the original series.
B003ZSJ212|5.0|It's a great film for the whole family. My husband and my son love all off the movie in this combo pack.
B004U8SSSO|5.0|\\"Great\\". Just checking it out. I don't have any more to say then that. Any more would not help out here.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|just what I was looking for. best one for kindle fire hands down! looks great, fits screen perfectly. highly recommend this for anyone looking for a calculator app.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I like it becuz it is fun tno play but I don't like it becuz the words are kthe same every time I don't know ifbits just my kindle fire or not
B000FC1LOC|5.0|This was the first selection for a small book club I joined. Others had read the book and seen the movie, giving rave reviews. I had not seen or read anything from this author before. I read some of the reviews on Amazon and decided to just read the book without any outside influence.<br />I was totally immersed in this book! Though fictional, the emotions and relationships came through as if it was not. Ending was not expected, but was a good way to complete.
B004T824HG|5.0|\\"Great\\". Just checking it out. I don't have any more to say then that. Any more would not help out here.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This game is charming without requiring a great deal of study to start.  Over time the strategy kicks in.  The best $3 game ever.
B0036EH3UC|1.0|Just finished watching all of BSG... what a let down. The finale basically made all of season 3 and 4 a useless and pointless waste of time.<br /><br />pros: some of the best acting I've ever seen<br />  some of the best space battles ever (new caprica escape!!!)<br /><br />cons: the religibabble<br />  the story or lack of a story rather<br />  the finale<br /><br />BSG left me with a ripped off/wasted my time feeling, although I would recommend watching/buying it, for the acting and space battle scenes, but know that anytime anything religious is said it is religibabble equal to the technobabble from star trek, just meaningless words strung together to give the impression of meaning, looks like Ronald D Moore didn't leave star trek all that far behind after all.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I play it every day. also my lil girl likes to play it. we play together. only thing is there has been a glitches and we did not get some of our reward items. she was disappointed about that. played on kindle fire
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book - even through the tears it provoked. Enzo became a real character while remaining a believable dog (ok, I stretched that part a bit). But the story was heart wrenching and uplifting at the same time. Yes, a bit hokey now and then, but I didn't really mind. The humor was great as well as the story. I recommend it for any animal lover.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|At some stage I had to put this movie at double speed. The guy who made the movie and play the lead role is a total egocentric, thinking that his vision will make a great road movie. Wrong. It take more than this to make a good road movie.
B006BG7RI0|5.0|As time goes by this movie gets better. It holds your attention with the story, the acting, the drama of a period in history and peoples lives.<br />I own in my collection every version released. This is the one to own. The detail and crispness of the HD lets you see every nuance of emotion, further showing the caliber of actor portraying each role. Complete with all the extras this set contains, there's a place on mantle for this. I also went to see it at the theater during its one night only showing. Packed house. No disappointment here. Just wish more of these were released for those remaining of that passing generation.
0374275637|5.0|Must read for inventors, innovators, entrepreneurs and investors !<br />The main problem is that you cannot read it fast, like a novel.<br />You have to ponder, think hard and brood over slowly, each page after each page :-)<br />Then, a kindle version is the best (moreover the quickest and cheapest),<br />to keep it in your smartphone for small \\"sips\\" several times a day.
B00756GKBA|3.0|Music is ok, prefer some of her earlier CD's (like Candy Store).  Will put a few songs on my Ipod for walking music.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I like gun bros better but when i found out that you have to pay money to convert money to coins I thought that was ridiculous so here I am
B004EPYZUS|3.0|I really wanted to see this movie but on my limited Social Security budget, I could not take the two grandchildren we are raising to see it in the theater so we patiently waited until it came out on video. Any more the theater for 3 of us costs $45 to $50 and that is only a drink and a popcorn that we share. To watch it here many times with microwave popcorn was much less.
B003CFBQBW|5.0|I received my cd like I was told and I couldn't be happier. I've listened to it and have enjoyed every minute of it.
0446571415|2.0|I'VE READ MANY BOOKS BY THIS AUTHOR BUT THIS IS HIS WORST. IT'S STRICKLY KIDS READING OF \\"CLOAK AND DAGGER\\" SUBJECT AND THE MAIN CHARACTER IS SUPERMAN IN STREET CLOTHES. I WOULD NOT RECOMEND THIS BOOK TO ANY HALF INTELLIGENT PERSON!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B004XUDJII|5.0|The songs are touching with in depth lyrics beyond her years. There is variety of melody and beats. Very enjoyable.
B0067AC5KA|5.0|Really enjoyedH all three books. each one was better than the last one.  Loved the charactors and the action. Hope some one finishes the 4th one.
B0059XTTW8|2.0|I was really disappointed in this story..it was slow and hard to follow..it is a remake of an old movie.I would like to see the original and see if that is better

1429218207|3.0|honestly there is no good inorganic text out there. the assigned text for my class was M&T's inorganic chemistry which I think is the standard book that other inorganic texts are compared to.While that text covers a wide range of topics, it is quite bland and not clear on explanations.some sections are well written but the authors do not explain  in great detail making it hard to learn from.<br /><br />i only found this book after i had finished my 1 semester inorganic course (which was more on descriptive inorganic chemistry covering a wide range of topics from coordination chemistry, bioinorganic, hsab theory, solid state etc).  Now that i found it, i wished i had this book during the semester as it wouldve been a great help in understanding the material.i have also used atkins physical chemistry book and while i admit he is not the best at conveying information in a simple manner, this book compared to M&T's inorganic chemistry is much more readable

B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I just finished reading the hunger games trilogy by Suzanne Collins.  While I was initially apprehensive about reading the series, because I typically do not read SCI-FI books. I was pleasantly suprised, by all three books. The first book in the series, The Hunger Games, was so well thought out and had such brilliant character development, I was quickly involved with Katniss and Peeta, I finished the book in just 2 days.  The second book in the series, was just as good and I finished it again in 2 days.  The third book in the series, The Mockingjay, took me a little longer to get through, and I was a little disappointed with the ending.  That being said, I would recommend this book to anyone.  Though the Hunger Games may have initially been geared towards young adults, this trilogy can be read and enjoyed by any reader.  On a side note, read the books before you see the movies, you'll be glad you did.

0143119680|1.0|I was super excited to read this book after reading People magazine's review. I LOVE historical fiction, I love supernatural stories, I basically love reading (I go through a book or two a week). I especially love vampire books and have since I was in my teens and read and reread Anne Rice's vampire books (Pandora and Queen of the Damned...AWESOME). I love the Sookie Stackhouse series, The Historian, Let the Right One In... and I'm one of many who despises the Twilight series. I couldn't even finish the fourth book because I was sooo disgusted with how Bella and Edward turned out, how awful the writing was. I don't mind a little romance in my books, but I can't stand watching this character who is suppose to be all strong, confident, and fiercely independent become a simpering fool who can't function without her boyfriend.<br /><br />With that said, my dad finally lent me this book. He was not impressed with it, and couldn't even half-heartedly say it was \\"ok\\". I still wanted to read it. It started out interesting, but I quickly started thinking, \\"Dear God. This is going to be exactly like Twilight\\"...yeah, I was right. I could predict every single thing that happened in this terrible book.<br /><br />I did not like how the author tried to portray how freakin awesome Diana was, how macho sexy Matthew was. It felt forced, like the author was trying too hard to make these characters interesting. Dear Harkness, Diana is not strong, independent, or confident, when she latches on to the first male who shows interest in her! Diana morphed into a baby or a pet to Matthew. She ate when he demanded she eat, she drank tea when he forced it on her twenty million times, she slept when he said to, she worked when he said to, she exercised when he said to...if he wasn't around, she'd faint at her own shadow, almost drown herself in her \\"witchwater\\" tears, or simply wait for him, without a thought process going on. She just waited. Switched rooms. Waited. What a despicable thing to happen to the lead character! And I just don't think Matthew is dark, mysterious, sexy, when he's a possessive, controlling, short tempered lame vamp.<br /><br />Nothing in this story remained consistent, characters were introduced with overly lengthy descriptions, and then never appeared in the story again. The author made every single character in this book love Diana from the start, and if they didn't, they loved her after a few days. How many times did someone say about Diana, \\"She's so brave\\", \\"She's very courageous\\", \\"So willful!\\" \\"he eyed her appraisingly\\"....ummm NO. Just because you make the characters say that doesn't make it true. Diana was stupid. She would do whatever Matthew told her to do, except avoid danger when it approached (girl deserved what Satu did to her after she wouldn't listen to Matthew and NOT go outside by herself...) Just how many times did Diana need rescuing? How many times did she pass out? She's so weak that she needs to sleep through half the book?<br /><br />Diana talking to the deer Matthew was hunting? STUPID. \\"Stop running little deer. He's not trying to harm you, he just needs nourishment, so he needs to eat you. Stop running. Give up the fight, little friend.\\" Honestly?<br /><br />Anyways, while reading this book, I texted my friend telling her that I wanted to burn this book because it sucked so bad. She told me she was reading the reviews on here, and basically everyone was complaining about what I was. I have to say, the reviews are better than the book!o happen to the lead character!

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|This album is amazing and all songs are breathtaking, especially Trespassing, Cuckoo, Pop that Lock, Underneath and Runnin.<br />It's so hard to choose because there isn't a single bad song on the entire album.<br />Probably my very favourite is Runnin, because I love the deepness of Adam voice when he sings the low notes, it's like having soft dark silk caressing the ears...<br />Wonderful music, incredible vocals, magic atmosphere. The best album ever, you need to buy it and it will immediately become a drug. Adam deserves every single drop of success he's having, but I'm sorry to say he would deserve a lot more: for the talent, charisma, personality and voice he has he should sell millions and millions of albums worldwide. Hope it will happen.

B002PXFYLU|3.0|One of those books that you can't read casually and in small snippets. This is more a book that requires you to spend the time with, read slowly and think about what is being said. I was surprised at how short the book actually turned out to be, with almost half of the book dedicated to analysis.<br /><br />This book is one of those that you put on your shelf and refer back to again and again. Doing so will ensure that you get the most from it. The ideas in the book are not earth shattering they are all simply good common sense but sometimes it is actually beneficial to have these presented to you in another form.<br /><br />A good book but one that cannot certainly be casually. It is however a book that can be read over and over and each time something new can be gleaned from its pages.
0670022411|5.0|My favorite book of late!  Even though I finished reading it months ago, I find myself fondly remembering the characters and scenes from this book.  Wonderfully detailed, interesting, well-developed characters.  Wonderful romance!  Enough intrigue to keep everything interesting.  Amusing and unexpected details (the house that reconfigures itself to welcome guests).  If you like romances of alpha males with strong women in a paranormal setting, you will love this book!

B001HN6922|1.0|This is my son's review.<br /><br />After reading the other reviews, I see that they are more preoccupied with the heavy violence and political preaching in this film. Although these might be concerns to some, I would like to focus on the myriad of plot, character, and plain old problems this film is riddled with. (By the way, I didn't really care about the picture's support for alternative fuels.  The debate in \\"Cars 2\\" was more about corruption and international intrigue than any sort of political message.). There are two camps in which my quibbles can be divided into:<br /><br /> #1: The Plot. The story of \\"Cars 2\\" was paper thin. There was scarcely any character development. The films seems to be a thinly-veiled send-up of action and James Bond movies, a la \\"The Naked Gun\\", but there is too much serious pyrotechnic stunts and projectile-based action to actually qualify as a spoof. The jokes were unfunny, mostly of the immature toilet humor kind. All the action-adventure sequences can't make up for the lack of substantial plot. Too many movies demonstrate this. Why should Pixar?<br /><br />#2: The Characters. As I said before. no development. Most of the major characters from the previous film are either missing or relegated to minor rolls. The decision to kill off likable Doc Hudson (off-camera, of course) means the film is lacking both a father figure and a sort of commentator towards the action. Fillmore was in a woefully small role, and the film lacked a peacenik voice of reason and compassion. Sarge's comic hard-line militarism is also one, seeing his extremely tiny roll. I don't remember Red, Lizzy, Ramone, Flo, Luigi, or Guido being doing more than making a cameo. In fact, I don't remember some of them being in \\"Cars 2\\" at all! Finn McMissile was one of the few likable characters, but his accent and lack of British dry wit meant that he quickly outlived his usefulness. His female companion was dull, and Lightning McQueen has now been downgraded to a whinerwho sits on the sidelines and does nothing while Mater does heroic acts. Mater himself was very annoying, not at all funny or likable. I always thought that Larry the Cable Guy wasn't humorous anyways.<br /><br />In conclusion, this is the worst Pixar movie by far, behind \\"Ratatouille\\", which could have been done better in live action with anamatronic and puppet rats. I hope that Pixar doesn't keep producing trash like \\"Cars 2\\".

B001DF68MA|5.0|my son is 38\\" tall, 35 lbs, and 3 years old.  I am 5'8\\" and all legs.<br /><br />He LOVES this seat and constantly wants to go on a bike ride.  We live in the mountains in Colorado, and this may not have worked if i started to use it there, but we got it for a month long vacation in Florida.<br /><br />My son hates the bike trailer and literally screams the entire time, somehow gets himself out of the seat belts, rips open the zipper and try's to jump out!  He is a bit of a challenge, and I didn't like the idea of him being in a seat behind me because I don't know if he got his seatbelt off, I can not reprimand him for trying to jump off or throwing his weight around, and we really can't even talk with him in a seat behind me.<br /><br />The wee ride is on my mountain bike and does work with a few quirks that I can handle.<br /> 1. When I bend over to hold the handlebars my face is  in his helmet, unless he leans over and rests on the little rest area, which he does most often when I ask him to. It also doesn't help that he has the razskull shark helmet so the fin hits me!  So, I moved my bar ends so they are facing up and toward me.  When I grip the real handlebars my wrists hit the bar ends, but not in any way that inhibit movement.  I ride holding the bar ends until I need to shift or stop, which has worked great for us.<br />2. I have to angle my legs out to get around his seat.  It is not much, but enough to definitely work your inner thigh like never before.  Standing up to pedal is fine, but just not the same.  (this may not be a concern if my legs were just a little bit shorter) This has actually ended up to be a blessing because I have tracking problems with my knees because my inner thigh muscles are under developed.<br /><br />We have been doing 10+ mile rides almost every day and it has been great!  I am even looking forward to making it work when we get home and ride on mountain roads!  My son feels like a part of the ride.  We talk and kiss, he even held a drink once.  He likes to point out bumps and many other things.  He waves at people, yells \\"on your left\\", helps decide which way to go, or remembers which way to go once we get in a routine ride.  I have passed several parents who are stopped so they can turn around and talk to their kid in the seat behind them, or parents yelling \\"I cann't hear you...wait till we stop!\\"<br /><br />It has been so great for us and I am incredibly thankful we got it and not a seat that goes behind.
B0000DZ3EN|4.0|I recently discovered \\"Return to Oz\\" on one of the Showtime movie channels.  I never saw it in the theaters when it came out in 1985, and honestly didn't know it existed.  Having seen it, I can understand why it didn't do well at the box office.  This movie is almost the polar opposite of the 1939 movie \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", which though it had its own dark moments remained largely upbeat.<br /><br />Dorothy Gale (played by Fairuza Balk, in her motion picture debut) returns to the Land of Oz six months after her first visit there (the one portrayed by Judy Garland in 1939) and finds that all is not well.  The magical Yellow Brick Road is buckled and broken, and the Emerald City is a shambles, bereft of its signature jewels and its citizens turned to stone.  With the help of Tik-Tok, the mechanical man who serves as the Royal Army of Oz, Jack Pumpkinhead, The Gump, and Billina (Dortohy's favorite chicken), Dorothy faces the Nome King, the evil being who has stolen the emeralds and destroyed the city.<br /><br />This movie is decidedly not for younger viewers.  There are moments in this movie that can be very disturbing.  (The Wheelers, for me, are most creepy.)  But for adults who fondly remember \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", \\"Return to Oz\\" puts a decidedly different spin on things.  Normally, the distance between movies like this would be a detriment.  \\"Return to Oz\\" debuted nearly half a century after \\"The Wizard of Oz\\", and was produced by a totally different studio (Disney instead of MGM).  But that distance really works here because the story is radically different.  And the music by David Shire helps set the tone that this is not our grandparents' version of the magical land.<br /><br />\\"Return to Oz\\" makes magic in its own right, despite the darkness and bleakness that makes up most of the movie.  The triumphant moments that emerge are indeed very satisfying and serve to remind that even in darkness, there is hope.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|Could not put the book down.  The intimate parts were a little overwhelming, however, the whole story was wonderful.  I enjoyed her as she stood up for herself and loved to see her break down his barriers.  As for him, his sexual practices was a little over the top, but he never forced her, what I like about him was that he was so rich (of course)and how protective he was of her.
1400063515|2.0|I started reading this book and was almost immediately turned off by Taleb's writing style.  I stuck it out and halfway through I was starting to like it as he starts to make a lot of good points and challenge the way we think.  But by the time I was done I was turned off again, the culmination being when Taleb decides to stop talking about things he knows about and start giving advice on the best way to diet and exercise because the \\"experts\\" of course don't know anything more than he does.<br /><br />I wouldn't recommend this book mainly because the author's seeming arrogance, pretentiousness, and bitterness permeate almost every page and make it unenjoyable.  I don't mean to make this review a personal attack on Taleb...I don't know him at all and maybe he's a wonderful person.  But he doesn't present himself well in this book and ultimately his writing style ruined it for me.  Ironic too because he (rightfully) criticizes how arrogant and out of touch the establishment can be but he ends up in the same boat as them (at least in my exposure to him in this book).  If you want a book with similar ideas to challenge the way you think I'd recommend Kahneman's new book.
B007ZAI2C6|5.0|Alright, if you have been watching the season so far, you know Castle and Beckett have been going through a rough patch. In this episode, Castle has pretty much decided this latest case will be his last. So...he wants to go out with the coolest case ever...and the city of New York complies in classic fashion. A professional is attacked and partially eaten in a parking garage by a.....zombie! The only witness was also bitten and thinks he is going to become a zombie as well. What more could you ask for, lol. Castle has that wide eyed child like look on his face when the suspected zombie is revealed, which is awesome. Coolest case ever? Maybe. Either way, this episode is pretty hilarious, and ends well leading into the season finale. One of my favorites as of yet.<br /><br />Enjoy!

145162445X|2.0|From now on I'm subjecting every book I consider buying to an exclamation point check! I think one is too many for a serious book, but Krauss apparently believes we can't get enough of them! Aside from that, and his penchant for preening in order to let us know that he, too, is a seminal thinker, Krauss writes well and explains the science as clearly as I think anyone could. He provided me, at least, with a provocative new perspective on the possible origins of whatever it is we believe to be our universe.  I cannot recommend the book to friends, who would find the exclamation points appalling, but I did find it worth reading.

B0083GQ2A0|5.0|This is a very cerebral film about survival in an already difficult situation (plane crash, coldness, injuries, lack of food, and a handful of morons to \\"lead to safety\\"). Liam Neeson is the classic situational leader and main character in this film as he is thrust into a hectic fight for survival in the Alaskan Wilderness. The movie presents a few moments of quirky and cheesy dialogue but it shows the \\"human\\" aspect of the characters faced with such a tremendous ordeal and each is tested to their breaking point.There is also some gruesome scenes that will be sure to keep you on your toes. Try not to spill your popcorn!!! All in all I expected a different ending however, it was a good movie.

B000FP2OPY|3.0|I missed the early seasons of Supernatural when they aired and so never really got into the show. Now I'm working my way through the seasons, starting from the beginning.<br /><br />This first season is a real mixed bag. At it's core there's clearly potential right from the pilot episode. But there's also a lot of stand alone \\"monster of the week\\" type stuff that doesn't do much for me.<br /><br />The show started on the WB network and then transfered to the CW when WB and UPN merged. It shows. There's a distinctly WB look and feel at least in these early episodes. Young cast, lots of music, montages etc.<br /><br />The cast of regular characters is very (too) small. Basically the Winchester brothers have to hold everything together themselves and the two actors, though clearly picked for their looks, actually hold up their ends pretty well.<br /><br />But the lack of any sort of supporting cast (there are only two other actors who appear more than once) is a major problem and the show rapidly falls into formula and feels like it's treading water.<br /><br />Yes there are some nice bits of brotherly interaction. But we have the meet a nice girl, but have to part ways story played out twice in the first season.  The show just needs a larger recurring cast.<br /><br />Fortunately the character of Meg Masters shows up in episode 11 and we finally get to see some progress in the story arc. But it isn't until the last five episodes of the season that the pace picks up. That significantly changed my view of the series and I'm actually looking forward to season two now.
B0083GRZ10|5.0|This is the only good episode I saw post-baby storyline. I enjoy \\"The Finder\\" much, much better. I can't honestly believe \\"The Finder\\" and \\"Human Target\\" were cancelled and \\"Bones\\" kept by the same network. This finale gives me hope that next season might improve.
B004EPYZV2|2.0|I like to be positive where it's possible. However, until I saw this movie, MI 2 was my least fav. GP is now. I very much liked the first & third MI installments - and Tom Cruise's work in particular.<br /><br />Yet, despite how anxious I was to view this movie, (I streamed it in VuDu's HDX, before it was available to me on disc) I was surprisingly disappointed.<br /><br />Being a true fan of the original TV series, I was glad to see that the movie renditions did no disrespect to either its originality - or the great characters created and portrayed so well by the former actors. But unlike MI 1 or 3 - GP seemed to really bomb out and defined rock bottom - IMHO.<br /><br />Unlike the predecessors, great \\"true-to-form\\" MI creativity always tightly integrated into an intelligent storyline, seemed to be rather \\"cheaply replaced\\" by repeated overdoses of over-the-top stunts and special effects.<br /><br />I enjoy the innovative technological aspects typical of MI in general - and honestly, the Blu-ray transfer, audio tracks, and over-all production quality for this one were also quite good. But GP's overall experience sank with a sharp dip in delivery. Hopefully, the next one does better.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|I saw this movie because I thought there would be some cool fight scenes with wolves, as the trailer seemed to indicate.<br /><br />There is exactly one, and its pretty lame.<br /><br />The dude who is a \\"wolf expert\\" is a total dumbass and makes decisions that have the audience thinking it's a stupid horror movie.<br /><br />What a waste of time, I'm completely confused as to how any of the production crew screened this movie before it released and said \\"Yah, that's good\\".

0385344228|4.0|What would you do if your 14-year-old child were charged with murder? My instinctive reaction to this question is that it is too ridiculous to even think about. That's certainly what Andy Barber thinks when his son, Jacob, is charged with the murder of a classmate in Defending Jacob by William Landay.<br /><br />To make matters worse, Barber is the assistant district attorney and is in charge of investigating the case. He is completely oblivious to the fact that his son is a suspect until the day he is put on a paid leave of absence and a search warrant is delivered upon his house.<br /><br />In addition to defending his son, Barber must defend himself against allegations that he mishandled the investigation or that he never should have taken on the investigation in the first place due to a conflict of interest. Barber has also been hiding a secret from his family, friends, and co-workers-- his own father is serving a life sentence for murder.<br /><br />I can't really say I liked the book, but I did find it hard to put down. The characters were so completely unlikable-- Andy Barber is arrogant, oblivious and just plain stupid-- how can he not think that he should recuse himself from the case when allegations about his son start circulating on Facebook, when the boy who was killed was not only one of his son's classmates, but was bullying Jacob? Andy's stance from the very beginning is that he has to believe Jacob is innocent so he won't even consider the possibility that other people might think Jacob is guilty.<br /><br />Andy's wife, Laurie, is equally unlikable-- if Andy is blindly convinced of Jacob's innocence, Laurie is pretty much equally convinced that Jacob is guilty. When she finds out that her husband's father is a convicted murderer, she latches onto the idea of a \\"murder gene\\" and becomes convinced that Jacob is doomed to a life of violence because of his possession of the gene. At a time when she and her husband should be drawing together to support their son, she is too filled with anger at her husband for hiding the truth about his father, and anger at herself and Andy as parents for missing the signs that are clearly in retrospect indicators that Jacob is a vicious killer.<br /><br />Finally there is Jacob, himself, who is a pretty repugnant example of a 14-year-old boy. Realizing, of course, that 14 is not a particularly attractive age for most teen-aged boys, Jacob is singularly whiny, defiant, and stupid. There were many times while reading this book that I was ready to throw the entire dysfunctional family into the clink and throw away the key.<br /><br />But yet, about halfway through the book I became completely engrossed in it. I wanted to see how it ended, and I wanted to know if Jacob was actually guilty. At the end of the book, Andy and Laurie remained true to their characters-- Andy in his continued \\"love is blind\\" stance of supporting his family, and Laurie in her constant fear about what she may have unleashed upon the world. Landay's overall message, it seems is about family, and no matter how dysfunctional the family, family still looks out for family.

0345803485|2.0|After hearing on the radio how this \\"erotic\\" book series was sweeping the nation, causing women everywhere to flock to the neatest bookstore and library only to find that the books were being pulled from the shelves, I took interest.  I've never been a fan of cheesy romance novels, but the thought that there was a force out there that would make the decision for me and not allow me access to the books made my blood boil, so I purchased the entire trilogy.  Then after reading book one, I realized what a great marketing ploy I had succomed to.  Not that I think any book should be banned, this book did not live up to the hype.  I agree with many of the reviews on here in that a hot 21 year old virgin who has never touched herself, is far from believable.  I got tired of the constant inner monologue between her \\"inner goddess\\" and her \\"subconscious.\\"  I also found it extremely annoying that the vocabulary used seemed somewhat intelligent except when it came to the juicy parts, then it was like listening to kids.  Frustrating.  Learn from me, don't buy the books, just borrow them from someone like me who did. My face flushes scarlet when I think of this book being on the best seller list.

B0066W1AZK|5.0|At first I thought the chess game would be almost impossible to beat but soon found that the different levels made made the game realistic and enjoyable.  I found that I could let a beginner play and adjust the level accordingly and he didn't loose interest.
0891419063|5.0|I just started reading this book over the weekend and have not been able to put it down.  Its a an easy read. without a lot of \\"military talk.\\"  So descriptive of what it would be like to be in battle. I highly recommend this book!  Very well written!
076115728X|5.0|I read this book to my kindergarten students 3 months ago and they still talk about it.  Some will even point out how they turned their own \\"oops\\" into a beautiful piece of art. This book encourages children to seek strategies for solving problems. Love this book!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|definitely worth playing. funny and fun. a bit of an issue with controls. otherwise everything is as it claims. try it.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I read book 1 after all of my Mommy friends were flat out raving about this book. I can't say it enough:  this is DISTURBING reading material to any female who considers herself a strong, independent woman. The main male character spanks the female lead twice in the first book, to the point of tears. They repeatedly have sex (maybe 5 times a day!) and while graphic, I felt so much anger at the male lead, I was disgusted. Why was I dusgusted: bHe gets mad at her for rolling her eyes, she must call him \\"sir\\" and he tracks her down (\\"stalking\\") numerous times while she is out and about or if she wants to go visit family, he gets upset.  And this is romantic?!  He has serious, serious issues and I promise, if you have ever experienced an aggressive boyfriend or you are a strong, independent woman, you very well may hate these books. It sickens me to think a woman repeatedly consents to this behavior by a man, just because they are incredibly sexually compatible (to the point of being totally unbelievable). We wonder what's wrong with the world today?  This is a best seller that everyone is raving about but it is so appalling and disturbing. The aggression by the male lead, the \\"stalking\\" that they make light of and the dominant/submissive sex r'ship is glorified. I PROMISE that if you want a nice, graphic read without such craziness, try \\"The Black Dagger Brotherhood,\\". This book is just pure trash that is VERY disturbing. Not worth a dime...even if everyone talks you into it!

1416914307|3.0|I truly am not a huge fan of these books. As I mentioned in my first review, City of Bones, I bumped the series up on TBR because of all the hype surrounding the books.<br /><br />This book was meant to be the third and last book of the series. Although I'm not a fan I do want to say that Cassandra Clare did a good job of weaving in all the loose ends nicely. There were some things about the book that annoyed me and I will list them but they weren't bad enough to score this one a one.<br /><br />As I've mentioned before I'm not wow'ed by the writing. It's ok. In this book as in the other two there were reminders of other books that I shall not name since I've already named THE book.<br />In the last book we are introduced to the youngest Lightwood, Max. He's about ten. In the book he is killed and in the oddest of ways. His killing really didn't make sense and I couldn't understand why the author would choose to kill him of all people. Clary is still her whiny self. Jace is still his repugnant self. Clary now wants to get more serious with Jace and Jace is now saying no they should just be brother and sister...wackadoo...<br /><br />Besides that there were some more off the wall things plugged into this book that I found... well... off the wall. For example, in the middle of a fighting scene Alec stops to yell at Magnus because he wants to know...wait for it... wait for it... wait for it... WHY HE HASN'T ANSWERED HIS CALLS.<br /><br />What the heck?<br /><br />In the middle of a battle of all things to stop and talk about!...It was just ridiculous. I also found Clary's reaction to her mother odd after she had tried so hard to revive her. The only other thing I didn't really like was the lack of a connection with some characters. A lot of these characters were supposed to feeling sadness and a whole lot of other emotions and I just didn't get that from them.<br /><br />I'm on to the next book and I will tell you this: Simon is ALREADY annoying me.
B001KVZ6HK|5.0|This movie was truly phenomenal in many regards. This film brought together many heroes and they all had their moments Hawkeye or Black Widow weren't just \\"thrown in\\" as some people worried about.Mark Ruffalo who came-in after Edward Norton's Incredible Hulk film made a fantastic Bruce Banner/Hulk in this movie. Joss as I assumed he would did a great job with the dialogue between all our favorite superheros.It was amazing the five films leading up to this and then to have this ultimate,epic superhero team film. I've never seen a film like it in some ways. There is a high probability you won't see a Gi JOE or even Justice League team up type movie ever work like this film worked IMO.<br /><br />I can absolutely not wait for part 2 and to have this on Blu-Ray, I am going to see this again tomorrow.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I agree u should buy this game first cause it's free second cause it's fun. I reccomend this game. please read this review it's true...
B001AITGWE|5.0|I love being able to view parts of California then and compare them to now.  The same issues that are shown in Falling Down are still very real and observable in today's society.  LA is depicted perfectly with regards to the traffic, the lack of jobs, the gang issues, etc...  This movie helps show that no matter how much things change, they stay the same.
0525423281|5.0|Audio Book<br /><br />Lola and the Boy Next Door was SUCH a CUTE story! I really liked this read better than Anna and the French Kiss. I have fallen in love with Stephanie Perkins' writing. It's always light, funny, easy and realistic. All of the characters were likable. I loved the family dynamic that was created in this book. I haven't read anything like this yet. It was refreshing and executed in such a great way. Lola was such an interesting character and it took me a bit to realize that she had a totally new look every single day. Anna and Etienne make an appearance in this read. The reader was able to catch up with them enough to still appreciate their relationship yet still understand that Lola and her story was on the front burner.<br /><br />The narrator was pretty awesome and she did a great English accent when creating Etienne's voice.<br /><br />This has been great all the way around. Great world building, great characters, great story, great ending!<br /><br />My only regret is not standing in line at RT to buy these books and get Stephanie Perkins' personalized signature! UGH! Maybe next time...<br /><br />*This is a stand alone read. You DO NOT have to read Anna and the French Kiss prior to this one to follow along.
0843176881|5.0|Love the Mr. Men series.  This story is funny and we bought it for a friend who live in Canada.
0345803485|5.0|This book blew me away. It's not all about sex. I really connected with the characters. I loved it. And I am looking forward to reading the next 2 books!
0439023513|5.0|WOW! I dove right into this book immediately after finishing Catching Fire. I just had to... I tried going to bed in the wee hours of the morning but I kept going back to reading and then sleep just lost the bloody war altogether. This was CRAZY. Once again this read was not predictable. It definitely had some what the heck moments that didn't end until the very last word.<br /><br />I was emotionally spent by the end of the book. I was sad. I really couldn't find happiness at the end because Katniss was so broken. Yet I still give it 5 stars. The originality is ridiculous! The reality of it all and how it all played out is ridiculous! The fact that Suzanne Collins didn't give us rainbows and roses was ridiculous! (Obviously I mean ridiculous in a very good light.)I have to give her so many accolades for being able to stand out and for not conforming to what readers would want.<br /><br />I definitely want to re-read this one and the one before this because I just need to. ;-) I say read this book and all the ones prior. It's so worth reading.
B006OCM0G0|3.0|they should make a dragon one. then a unicorn one. then a vampire one. then a mermaid one. then dance studio one. and an everything one. I likethis game
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|I'm on the 3rd book in the series. I've been into it since the first book. I wish there were more books in the series. I don't want it to end. This is a great story, well writen, that grabs you from the 1st page. I recommend getting the companian books, too, so you can put faces to the charactors. Of course by now you probably have seen the movie anyway. In any case, if you're a fan of Hunger Games, the books make a good collection.
0439023491|5.0|I totally loved this book from page one! It was definitely different from book one for me. I felt like book one obviously started the ball rolling and it just picked up momentum WITHOUT stopping in this book. Catching Fire, book two of the Hunger Games series, is the book that made me a fan!<br /><br />We get a quick catch me/you/everyone up on the last few months since the 74th Hunger Games have ended. Right after that catch me/you/everyone up we are quickly transported on the tour that is to take place about six months after the Hunger Games where Katniss and Peeta visit each of the districts but not before President Snow happens! President Snow is ticked to say the least that Katniss pulled one over on the capital, out gaming the game when she and Peeta threatened to eat Nightlock. Katniss has to prove to everyone that she truly was crazy in love with Peeta and that's what caused her to contemplate double suicide. OOOOH then there is this crazy twist that sends EVERYONE spinning!!!<br /><br />I really enjoyed this book! Like I mentioned before it was just non stop. Suzanne Collins is consistent in her writing style not letting anything slip up and being clear as day with the visions she weaves in the reader's head. My impressions of the book while I was reading it was that Suzanne Collins really thought this entire series out. Whether that is true or not it played out as if it was all intricately planned from the beginning. That is how smooth and put together it read. The twists and turns that this particular book takes will leave you with your mouth open.<br /><br />THE ENDING! OMG! THE ENDING! Not once did I expect it to end the way it did and when the book did end I quickly opened up the other book because I had to read what was next. Needless to say it was a rough couple of days with 0 sleep at all. Ha! Just like in the book...<br /><br />Go read this book. It will not disappoint!
B004EPYZSK|5.0|This item was just like new and plays like new. The movie was great as syfy and westerns are 2 of my favorate shows.
0439023483|3.0|I have to admit that I jumped on the band wagon because I love it when books are made into movies. More often than not the book is better than the movie because of the details lost in trying to keep the movie to two hours or so. However, there are times when all the stars are aligned and the movie is equally good if not better than the book. Making books into movies is also and honor and secretly you always hope that the viewer will become a reader of the book/series. SOOO I was rooting for the movie and the series having not yet read the series yet with all the intentions in the world of reading the series prior to the movie coming out. Mission accomplished. :-)<br /><br />With that said I was a little disappointed because I just wasn't understanding all of the hype with this first book. Mind you, I turned my son and niece onto the series and they were RAVING about this first book. I kept telling them \\"Guys, I don't yet get the big deal\\". I felt that the beginning was slow. I had a hard time understanding/believing this wonderful relationship that developed between Katniss and Cinna. I didn't think they spent enough time with one another to develop this closeness out of all the people who surrounded her.<br /><br />I think everything was simply written and eventually its simplicity is what won me over. I started to like the book when the games began. The author's ability to describe the feelings that Katniss felt as a tribute, the anxiety, the hunger, the panic, the desperate agonizing need to survive was amazing. You honestly felt all those feelings right along with Katniss and it was so clear. One of my pet peeves is when an author over explains scenes or gives to many details during battle scenes and ends up making a jumbled mess of it. Suzanne Collins definitely did not have this problem. I was a goner when Katniss teamed up with Rue. Katniss had been a bit a standoffish until then and she really was tender with Rue. So yeah going back to being a goner with theKatniss/Rue alliance... I cried like a baby and could not stop. That entire scene in the book was just incredible on so many levels. I could literally hear the song being sung and had already identified the melody and everything...I guess that's the singer in me.<br /><br />By the end of The Hunger Games I was definitely a happier person in that I confidently could say I liked the book obviously with reservations but I could honestly say I did. In the end what won me over was the realness I felt in the third part of the book. What won me over was that this author was able to make me FEEL.<br /><br />One other thing I want to mention is that the author did a great job with character development. Each and every character was consistent in their behavior. You could expect them to do or say what they did or said without thinking that was out of character. I don't mean that they were predictable because this is not the case but more that they were who they were, no questions. Another positive-Growth! Loved reading how some of these characters stepped up. :-)<br /><br />I definitely think this is a book people should read. It can be gory/violent but think of the plot and what these children have been forced to do. It's meant to be violent. This book is meant to shock the reader. It forces you to contemplate a world not too far off if we don't change some of the things happening present day.
B0066W1AZK|5.0|I absolutely love this app.. anyone should get it Bc it is fast and free to use.... very quick moves and level of difficulty adjustable
0525423273|4.0|Audio Book<br /><br />I have to admit that this has been on my list for a while. Yes, it caught my attention. Yes, the cover is cute and the description interesting enough. But no, I was not in a hurry to read a YA chic lit/contemporary. Adult chic lit/contemporaries have no issues with. Mostly. However, I am always weary about YA chic lit/contemporaries because when you are my age you kind of lose the patience to deal with some of the off the wall things these kids do. You know, doing things they and everyone with a brain know they shouldn't do but because they are teens they get permission to just do it anyway. NO. No patience for that behavior especially since I didn't behave that way at that age. However, I thought that I would bump this one up on my list after attending a workshop where the author of this book spoke. She didn't really talk about her book but more about the genre. At any rate, she was extremely smart, down to Earth and cool! It was the push I needed to bump her book up on that TBR list. I'm glad I did.<br /><br />It's Anna's senior year in high school and she has just been shipped off to Paris, France to attend a boarding school for American children. She's never been to France, doesn't know the language, doesn't know anyone and didn't want to be there to begin with. She is forced to start over and to be self-reliant whether she likes it or not.<br /><br />I thought this book was extremely cute. It was a fast paced, light read and for the most part, very believable. You felt as if you were in France and could vividly see the streets of Paris and all its loveliness. All of the characters were well developed and you knew exactly what to expect from them. I grew to like all the likable characters and not so much the nasty characters. There always has to be at least one; there were a few in this one. There was the dreaded love triangle in this book but not too bad. I liked the friendship that blossomed between Anna and Etienne aka St. Clair aka Etienne St. Clair and how they dealt with their communication issues.<br /><br />I won't lie, something happens between Anna and her best friend back home and although it might have been the presumed adult thing to do as an adult I would have NOT handled it the same way. LOL There is such a thing as GIRL CODE/WOMAN CODE/BESTIE CODE! COME ON! Something else that bugged me a bit was that we really don't get a clear justification from Anna's dad or his reasoning for sending her abroad senior year.<br /><br />All in all it was a perfect coming of age, coming into your own, moving one step closer to adulthood read.<br /><br />I must mention that the reader of this audio-book did a great job but could have worked on her English/British accent a bit better. :-)<br /><br />Much respect to you Ms. Stephanie P. for writing the book YOU wanted to write and not what the industry dictated you write.
0788859544|5.0|I've recently started buying all the classic Disney titles for my movie collection at home.  Now, I hadn't seen the Little  Mermaid since I was maybe 7 or 8(I'm 29 now).  After watching it 3 times the first week, all I have to say is WOW.  Everything about the movie is perfect.<br /><br />Now, everyone knows how the STORY goes so I don't need to talk about it, but even as an adult you can't help but root for the spirited Ariel who wants so bad to be part of a world that she doesn't belong to.  She's wide-eyed, earnest and genuine, but she doesn't wait for things to happen to her, she's proactive.  She's also got a great supporting cast in Sebastian, Flounder, the kooky Scuttle, and a formidable villain in Ursulla.  The MUSIC, actually resonates with me more now than when I was a kid.  Disney really had something special in Alan Menken and Howard Ashman. The melodies are great and catchy, the lyrics are effortless, have great deal of wit to them and they advance the story quite well.  I would even argue that Disney hasn't had a musical team that strong since(Alan Menken would go on to have more collaborators after Howard Ashman's passing but IMO nothing can top the songs they did for Mermaid, Beauty and Aladdin).  Also, this doesn't get mentioned as often as it should but this movie has a great deal of humor in it too(if I ever meet a woman who brushes her hair with a fork on our first date, I'd probably marry her lol)!<br /><br />The movie has been fully restored and looks great, there's a good deal of bonus features including deleted scenes, a wonderful \\"making of\\" documentary, the truth behind the story, a great short video \\"the little match girl\\" which will probably bring tears to your eyes, and much more.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this wonderful movie, which single-handedly saved Disney Animation, brought back the animated musical and started the 2nd Disney renaissance of the late 80's to the late 90's.
1416914293|3.0|This might contain spoilers. You should have read the first book by now if you are looking at this review but just in case there will be spoilers from the first book mentioned...starting now!<br /><br />City of Ashes takes place pretty much where City of Bones left off...give or take a week or so. Clary's mom is still in a self induced coma but at least she has Luke. She also seems to be in a heavy romance with Simon obviously trying to forget Jace but doing a horrible job of it. Jace is still in denial about A LOT OF THINGS! We learn more about the evil Valentine and his plan.<br /><br />Again, this book as it was with the first, was just ok with me. Nothing really amazing happens in the book. I think it was a bit drawn out. The action scenes are not written in a way that is clearly understood the first time around. I had to read some of these scenes a few times to understand what had just happened. Another thing, be prepared to keep track of the ever growing list of characters because there will be a few new ones introduced in this book.<br /><br />One pet peeve that I really really really can not shake off was one line in the book...<br /><br />Rafael, the head vampire who happens to be Latino who has migrated to the United States, walks up with Simon in his arms saying a line in Spanish. I was listening to the book in audio book form when I heard the line at first but then looked it up in the book because I really thought it was the reader goofing up the line... Nope the reader said it just as it was written.<br /><br />Rafael says \\"El no es muerto.\\" Which should be \\"El no esta muerto.\\" Yeah it bugged me because I think it comes back to so many authors doing so much research on things they include in their books and well this writer didn't...at least not on this one line. Having years of being corrected on how to speak Spanish properly and all my Spanish classes...well yeah now I see how it can be annoying. However, as a Latina reading how a Latino is being represented in a book and speaking in a book, I find it important for the character to at least know how to speak his native tongue... Just sayin'<br /><br />One thing I am having a terrible time getting passed, hoping! that it gets cleared up quick and painlessly, is the fact that Jace and Clary are still siblings in this book and are in love. Jace keeps pushing to just let it happen and although Clary keeps saying its wrong she wants it just as bad as he does. I am having a really hard time trying with my son reading the books and getting this message that its ok to have love affairs with your family members. It might be as obvious as heck that they are indeed not related but at this point you really don't know!<br /><br />Another thing is that Jace is a douche! LIKE OMG! kind of douche! How he has girls and grown women out there swooning over him I have no freaking idea...Nope not a clue. There is nothing utterly attractive about this kid. He is rude, sarcastic, mean, full of himself, prejudice and racist(which ebbs and flows and it's not consistent but more often than not is racism. I find nothing about this kid even worthy of attention. Straight up!<br /><br />I'm on to the next book in the series which I understand should have been the last book in the series. Let's see what happens!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I saw the author, E J James, interviewed on a morning show. She is a middle aged woman who wrote about a relationship between a man & woman that is different than most.  I became interested in reading the book, even though I don't usually care for trilogies.  The subject matter peaked my interest, sadomasochism & the fact that the male character is very rich & very good looking isn't bad either.  The book proved to be one of those you hate to put down.  I am defiantly looking forward to reading the next two books.  This is the 1st book I have downloaded from Amazon to my Kindle.  They make it so easy with no hassle and you are ready to read in no time.
B00004RD54|5.0|This Album was made great by Steve Hunter and Dick Wagner and what was basically Alice Cooper's backing band. It gave electricity to Lou Reed and the velvet Undergounds music. I saw an interview with Reed on the musician's guild and he basically admitted to confusion from actually playing with musicians and not posers. The musicians made the album and bring more credibility to Lou Reeds work. The most ironic thing about Lou Reeds work is the only other album I own is New York which rips on people who do what he spent the 70's doing, isn't irony great.

B003XF1XOQ|3.0|The book is good. I like it but little disappointed.. The charaters seems very aimless in this book. Katniss is most of the time in hospital or maniac or broken. Not as spirited as she was in first 2 novel.. Didn't understand why she was needed at all on fight as rebels brought the Capitol down..  Last few chapter were excellent when she kills the coin..
0345803485|1.0|I wish, oh how I wish I didn't have to write a bad review! And I say \\"have to write\\", because after wasting a week of my life reading this book, I can't in good conscience allow someone else to waste a week of theirs. It is one of the most poorly written pieces of literature...can I even call it that?... that I have ever read. Beyond the poor writing, the characters are sickening, all for their own ridiculous, annoying reasons. The plot is not so much a plot as splatters of adolescent banter heavily peppered with erotica. So much erotica, in fact, that the sex becomes boring, repetitive, and leaves you thinking \\"I wouldn't even want to have this much sex in my wildest fantasies.\\" It's rather a turn off. It's not an easy book to get through. Chances are you'll want to stop. My advice is, do it. It won't get better.

B007FXLZ9K|5.0|\\"Shame\\" shocked and moved me.  For such a slow-paced movie, it blew me away as million-dollar special effects never could.  Tender and heartfelt yet unrelenting in its brutality, this movie presents something new and real at every turn.<br /><br />Sissy is shallow and flighty, a failing singer who comes to New York to stay with her brother, the cool and controlled business professional.  From the beginning, we know something is awry.  Brandon and Sissy throw themselves at each other and break away screaming, they love and despise each other intensely.  Also, Brandon's addiction to sex is rather hard to hide.  Sissy's arrival plunges him into a downward spiral from which the viewer is not spared.  His endless bouts of sex are as off-putting to Brandon as they are to us; like any addict, he has lost all sense of joy or fulfillment in his vice long ago.  He no longer has any choice.<br /><br />Do Sissy and Brandon have an incestuous past?  What about their parents?  As Sissy says, \\"We're not bad people.  We just come from a bad place.\\"  Their past is veiled in dark, ugly shadows.  Like every great movie, \\"Shame\\" is open to many interpretations and raises far more questions than it answers.<br /><br />For such an ugly subject matter, \\"Shame\\" is truly beautiful.  On a final note, as a heterosexual female moviegoer I am glad-- after years and years of actresses going topless for no reason at all-- that a movie finally has the courage to show full-frontal male nudity.

B005FITIK0|3.0|Mavis Gary is a Minneapolis Carrie Bradshaw, glamorous, blond and living out her dream as a writer in the Big City.  You have every reason to hate her, except that she is miserable and failing at everything that matters:  Her marriage is over, the \\"Gossip Girl\\"-like series of YA novels she ghostwrites no longer sell,  and her closest (only?) friend is the puffy dog she loves to neglect.  So Mavis invents a new dream for herself-- stealing back her high school boyfriend, now happily married with a baby.  You see, in twenty years Mavis has avoided growing up at all.  She identifies so completely with her catty, egotistical teen protagonists because in her own mind she is still, now and forever, the Hot Cheerleader.<br /><br />Charlize Theron is a phenomenal actress who disappears into all her characters.  Costar Patton Oswalt is equally good.  The film is worth watching on the basis of these two performances.  It is also both funny and deep, especially Mavis's final conversation with one of the Plain Janes who worshiped her in high school.  I wish I could have liked it more, but the whole experience was a lot like high school:  Painful, and not something I would want to live through again.  I have not disliked a good movie this much since \\"21 Grams.\\"
B000F8O2OM|1.0|It's unfortunate that MGM has chosen to release such a poor quality set of DVDs. The picture quality is extremely grainy to the point that it seems like you're watching a VHS tape, during the dark scenes. This might have been fine 10 years ago, but for anyone who has become used to HD quality, you won't just be disappointed, you'll likely find your viewing experience far less enjoyable than you were hoping.<br /><br />I have also had LOTS of problems with the discs skipping and freezing up, in spite of having a relatively new (Blu-ray) player that I'm using. Even after inspecting the discs (which appear to be fine and which were sold as new by Amazon) and cleaning them, the episodes continue to freeze up. Extremely disappointing.<br /><br />Sadly, it appears that this is our only option for purchasing these on DVD, and it seems unlikely that they will get remastered soon, if ever.
B0059XTUB8|4.0|Thirty years old and fresh on her third marriage, Marilyn is not only an acclaimed actress but the most desired woman in the world-- her appearance in a small town in England, to film \\"The Prince and the Showgirl\\" with Sir Laurence Olivier, threatens to produce riots and heart attacks among young and old alike.  Yet Marilyn does not want to be worshiped, only loved and respected, and both seem beyond her reach.  Her Lindsay Lohan-esque antics aggravate her colleagues, and her new husband-- playwright Arthur Miller-- condescends to her and secretly wishes he had never married Marilyn.  Enter directing assistant Colin Clark, who looks about 15 and drinks in Marilyn's curves as voraciously as her words.  He needs Marilyn as much as she needs him.<br /><br />Eddie Redmayne's Colin, though undeniably pretty, did not really communicate anything to me.  Michelle Williams, on the other hand, is a beautifully expressive actress who brings to life the frightened girl beneath Marilyn's carefree facade of dancing, laughing and flirting, making her fears of ending up mad and alone-- like Marilyn's schizophrenic mother--seem real. People sometimes have a funny idea that beauty is insurance against being abandoned or betrayed by those you love.  As this movie shows, sometimes the opposite is true.<br /><br />A fun, sweet and enjoyable movie that allows you to imagine-- for 99 minutes at least-- what it would feel like to be Marilyn Monroe.

1401235417|4.0|Sceptical as I was about the DC reboot (who wasn't?) the new Batman really delivered. This is the beginning of the Court of Owls story that spans across most of the Bat-family titles through to today. I'm very impressed with Snyder's writing, his ability to seamlessly mix Bruce Wayne's and Batman's stories, showing that they are not two different people. Not a lot of writers can do that well AND tie together so many parts of the old Batman mythos. The concept if a Court of the Owls may not be totally unique, but the execution makes the volume well worth reading. I'm eagerly waiting for vol 2!
0439023513|5.0|Just finished \\"Mockingjay\\" and all I have to say is that Collins's Trilogy is amazing and one of my favorites to the day. The first two books are great and the third one is too but certainly it is what nobody expects from it. It isn't a book about the Games it is a war book and the best way to finish this story. It really makes you think about how a war can affect a person's life. The reader certainly notices this in the way the main character Katniss thinks now, how this war has drive her crazy, and since the book is narrated in first person you really become aware of this change. Really it's a great way to finish this tale. Highly recommend it if you really liked first two books.
0061478784|5.0|I've been avoiding reading this because I really dislike Studio Ghibli's art (not their stories, just the art.) Well, after one more glowing review flitted through my life, I finally ordered it from the library.<br /><br />Frankly, I would have read it in one sitting were it not for out of town company this weekend.<br /><br />While the characters were all engaging, and had their own lives and voices, it was the crafting of the story that blew my hair back. Nothing was left behind, nothing was unresolved and NOTHING WAS OBVIOUS. I'm 48, I can see a church by daylight. It's true, I did spent sometime trying to second guess the author, but the story telling here is so tidy I can only express my awe with speechless gaping. Kudos to Mrs Wynne Jones!<br /><br />The scary bits were actually scary, the romantic bits left me smiling and the adventure was non-stop. I've put it on my next book order so I can read it again and again.

B004XANKVO|5.0|From the reviews I read before I bought this bag I could not find anyone using it for a high-school book-bag. So I decided to write it from my own perspective.<br /><br />For the abbreviated review, skip to the last paragraph, you might have to do some scrolling.<br /><br />Let me start by saying that I love this bag, and if thats all you read of this review, you will not be disappointed by the bag. For those of you with concerns, I will try to adress them now. This bag is organized VERY well. The center pocket is EXTREMELY spacious, and can hold 6 textbooks all about 1.75in in thickness. If you carry more than that many books, just go buy a luggage cart. The laptop pocket holds any size laptop up to a 17in. But that dosent mean it wont cary a 13 or 11 in securely and safely. The tablet pocket will accomodate just about any 10 tablet including my galaxy tab 10.1. The added pockets at the top are great for carrying a mouse, cellphone charger or just cables. Dont expect to fit anything more than a magazine into this pocket though, as its very slim. the front pockets are great. Inside the front attached pocket thing there are three pockets, one zipper pocket, and two normal pockets of different sizes. The two pockets are perfectly sized for a scientific calculator (ti84 plus) and a sizable stack of notecards. The zipper pocket is well made and I use it for holding pens becuase i can trust the material they use. this pocket can also accomodate another larger item; like a pair of headphones or a kindle or a book.<br /><br />Moving to the main pocket there is ample room inside as mentioned above and some pockets above that are very handy because they are so high up they dont interfere with the books.<br /><br />The crushproof pocket has a feature that i dont think anyone else mentioned, it has the ability to be locked. The zipper will accomodate a standard travel lock. It is the only locking pocket on the bag as far as i know. That said, the zippers have holes in them big enough to possibly accomodate a standard padlock.<br />The bottom pocket is very flat, as you would expect. One reviewer wrote about uneven wear because the charger would cause a bump in the pocket. I dont have this fear because i have the extension on my mac charger, (it comes with one people, its in the box) so the pocket just sits flat.<br />The water bottle compartments are made of quite heavy material, unlike most other brands (come on northface). and they are easily large enough to accomodate a thermos.<br /><br />The straps and back padding are very comfortable as i assume they are made from some high density foam or gell. Some reviews complained about the straps pinching their necks. I have not had this problem. Though you should really think about this bag if you have a small frame. IT is VERY large and may be too large for anyone under about 5' 6\\".<br /><br />Another bonus about this bag is it excellent build quality. The strap adjustment loop things are made from solid aluminum and have a nice brushed finish. I dont expect them to scratch or break. The whole backpack is made with care and the zippers and straps, stitches and design show it. And Thule backs up their workmanship with a 25 year warranty.<br /><br />You made it, or you just cheated, whatever, in summary:<br /><br />If your a student and considering this bag I would say go get one, as long as you are big enough to carry it. It feels big, and rightfully so, at 32L its right at the top of the backpack range. Its excellent build quality and though in the designing process make this bag worth every penny of its pricey $129.99 price tag.enough to possibly accomodate a standard padlock.<br />The bottom pocket is very flat, as you would expect.

B0052VUNHC|5.0|I just finished reading this book and I was floored by it. I absolutely loved it. Abbys self distruction for fear of marrying a man just like her father spirals as she fights her love for travis. Such a great story. Loved it. Only wish there was a second book!

B007PKOKTK|4.0|This was a fun movie, but the best part was renting through Amazon Instant video. My child was sick and it was great to be able to get her something new to watch while stuck in bed without leaving the house.
B007549YM4|3.0|The premise is good.  The US is nuked and a small group of people take shelter in the basement of an apt complex.  But I really dont like any of the characters here.  They behave in a way which to me is not realistic.  Maybe it makes for a good movie, but I would rather see people behaving realistically in the situation.  Working together and try to manage through the ordeal.  The characters here are dumb and insane, particularly the 2 guys who become the 'leaders'.  And what is up with the guys with chunks of hair shaved out of their head?  Was that suppose to be their hair falling out as result of the radiation?  I hope not cus that looked ridiculous.  Overall the movie was okay but definitely could have been done better.
0385474547|2.0|I've read a number of Nigerian novelist and my favorite Nigerian writer is Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie. Her \\"Half of a Yellow Sun\\" is excellent.<br /><br />And so when I saw that \\"Things Fall Apart\\" on a \\"100 Best Books List\\" (The Guardian) I decided to borrow it.<br /><br />It is very rarely that I don't finish a novel, but I despaired of this one and returned it when I was about 70% through.<br /><br />It was after this that I looked at the Amazon reviews. I might borrow it again as a few people have written that it gets OK towards the end.<br /><br />But for at least 70% it's all about a tribal strong man beating wives and killing a child. From other reviewers I gather that this is meant to show there WAS \\"culture\\" in Africa before the white men came?<br /><br />IF that was the novelists intent, all I can say is that it failed  miserably.

B007Q2N0HA|4.0|I attempted to read Fifty Shades, I didn't make it very far.<br /><br />I don't usually read this genre, however...with all the hype about Fifty I decided to give it a try. I was NOT disappointed.  With a little research I came across this book that made me blush and think \\"OH MY!\\"<br /><br />I highly recommend this book, why?  It's a great way to spend your money, time, and energy.  It will get your blood flowing.  You will think of things you never thought of before. It may even make you want to try some things out. I'm not into the entire subjecting myself to a man telling me who and what to do, but Gideon does it soooo very well.<br /><br />I only gave it 4 stars because I became annoyed that at every chance she got, Eva ran out on him. It was getting to be too much.  I was wanting her to just stay in one spot and give the poor guy a shot to explain himself.<br /><br />Buy it, it's a short read and it'll keep you interested when the world is crazy around you.  I heard there is a sequel, I'm not desperate for it.  However, I will be happy to read it once it's out.

B007549W62|4.0|THE DIVIDE is definitely NOT an entertaining film.  While one of the most impressive apocalyptic movies in recent cinema, it is relentlessly brutal, often perverse and a real downer.  Director Xavier Gen offers a slow, deliberate pace that lingers on every disturbing sequence, resulting in a movie experience that left me feeling drained.  Nonetheless, the cast is superlative, each actor offering brave, committed performances that are remarkable.<br />Michael Biehn who has eluded \\"star\\" status despite his roles in megahits like ALIENS and TERMINATOR is brilliant as the building super who conditionally offers aid to his co-survivors.  There is an underlying sense of sadness to the former fireman who obviously suffered a deep personal loss on 9/11.  Rosanna Arquette is devastating as the mother whose loss of her daughter sends her spiralling into a sexual decadence that is overwhelming.  HEROES' Milo Ventimiglia is chilling and frightening as the sociopathic Josh, cruel, sadistic and barbaric.  A star-making turn for sure.  Richard Eklund as Bobby--OMG what a brutal performance!  A modern day Caligula who steals every scene he's in.  Then there's Lauren Germann as Eve, the supposed moral center of the group whose descent into cold self-centeredness is unfortunately realistic.  Ashton Holmes emerges as the most sympathetic character, who maintains a semblance of humanity.  Ivan Gonzales as nerdish Sam is a complex mix of cowardness and pent-up rage.  Even Courtney B. Vance in the smallest role is commanding and effective.  One of the best ensemble casts in recent memory!<br />THE DIVIDE  is an intense experience that will haunt you afterwards.
B0083GPDBO|4.0|first, i feel the premise that anyone beyond the age of 8 would devote newly acquired powers of telekinesis to pranking, let alone a set of three, is simply ridiculous...the guys remind me of 3 caesars, which would be i. steve as pertinax, the virtuous but gullible roman senator who assumed control of rome steeped in integrity, but also too naive to outlast his own praetorian guards by more than a few months  ii.  anthony as elagabalus, emotional dysfunction aside (and it is very pointed up, which actually subtracts from the theme of the film, which seems to be the morally disfiguring allure exerted by power on an intact personality). e assumed the imperium at 14,and squandered his own vast powers on such adolescent indulgences as the teaming and leashing of voluptuous women in harness to his personal golden chariot...his more traditional pursuit of murder does show some real signs of improvisation, however his own reign was also relatively brief...iii and finally matt as aurelius, the intelligent, diligent, and morally grounded exception to the rule, although not the only one.  however, the film seems to miss a critical point, and that is the true nature of this species, which has always had a strong tendency to set aside the dictates of conscience, and assumes no unusual temptations or abilities.  we are  certainly not apex predators.  bacteria easily outdistance us as survivors and hunters in the long run, which would be several billion years thus far.  the real apex predator of the world could still turn out to be a genetic anomaly, which is the status usually accorded to virus.  or perhaps an agenetic protein, such as prions.  i will mention in passing that i disregard the classical neodarwinian model of life as a ruleless gladiatorial arena, despite its great popularity among the unusually advantaged.  no powers more extraordinary than those already available to us have been needed to drive the human need for dominance and destruction.  in this way we elliminate our own underpinnings.  that is not a matter of moral struggle, it is a matter of design.
0307891372|5.0|The game of Skyrim is absolutely MASSIVE.  Eventually, I was getting so many new quests to follow, I was getting bored / overwhelmed.  This book has exactly what you need to make progress on the quests.  I highly recommend buying it if you plan to play Skyrim past level 10.
B0082K1LJY|5.0|Have to agree with previous review. Supernatural has changed my initial outlook on this type of genre for a tv series. I started with Season 1 on dvd last year and was hooked. I ended up watching all 5 seasons in about 5 days. Now Im with the Winchesters until the very end. I find the new direction refreshing and im anticipating where season 8 will take us.

B007C4ZJ3K|2.0|The fight scenes were pretty good... And that's about the best thing I can say about the movie.  Carano does ok in her first film.  She has potential but I don't think the filmmaker actual gave her much of a chance.
B000BB1MI2|4.0|Last night's bargain-rack movie was \\"Charlie and The Chocolate Factory,\\" a movie by Tim Burton and starring Johnny Depp. That says a lot doesn't it? Would you be expecting weird, or what? Remember, these guys have teamed up in \\"Edward Scissorhands\\" and \\"The Corpse Bride.\\" Well, you can also add the music of Danny Elfman, former leader of \\"Oingo Boingo\\" fame. Strange, strange movie. Oh, and by the way, if you've ever had the experience of a \\"fixer-upper\\" house or have even considered it, viewing the \\"fixer-upper\\" in this movie is worth the admission or DVD price.<br /><br />In any case, the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory, closed for some time with all the employees fired, has reopened and has offered a \\"Golden Ticket\\" to the first five people who find it inside five of their Willy Wonka Chocolate Bars sold on a world-wide basis. Their prize is a one-day all-you-can-eat tour of the new factory. The first four tickets were easy to find and, let's-just-say, they went to kids that you or Johnny Depp, the leader of the tour, would probably not care to spend a day with. The fifth kid, Charlie, came from an extended family who lived in the \\"fixer-upper\\" place and he was accompanied by his grandfather, a former laid-off worker in the old Willy Wonka Factory, who was suspected of giving away trade secrets in the old Willy Wonka days. Anyway, it's a weird tour. All the rivers, waterfalls, lakes and any other forms of water are liquid chocolate and the grass, flowers and anything else on the tour is one or another form of edible candy. Weird place. The elevators go up and down or sideways, depending on which way you want to go. The actors are all real (well, the lilleputian-sized people are an animation trick), but the factory, tour and everything else is one of these computer animation jobs, and it's clever and amusing. It's a fun, frivolous movie. Relax and enjoy.<br /><br />Gary Peterson

B0013J1WKY|5.0|Last night I watched/listened to a Christina Aguilera concert, \\"Back to Basics: Live and Down Under.\\" I picked up the DVD from the bargain-rack at a local Ross Store. It was a rather good DVD concert. Most concert DVDs seem to have either poor sound or poor photography, or both. This DVD was quite well done. Both the visuals and the sound were quite good and made for enjoyable watching and listening.<br /><br />I'd heard of Christina Aguilera, but this was the first time I've ever seen her or listened to her music. I was favorably impressed. She's a bit hard to peg, but I'd say she's part Soul, part Madonna and with a bit or Michael Jackson tossed in. The concert was impressive. Christina had about a 15-piece backing band, which reminded me somewhat of a small \\"Big Band\\" with a couple guitars. In addition, there were about 10 singers/dancers. Sorry if my numbers are off as it's hard to count with so many people on stage. Christina was usually front and center with mic and an active member of the dance troupe. I'd say the whole performance, together with the band, was rather active and athletic and Christina's vocals were excellent. The large Australian crowd, of course, loved the presentation and Christina and her troupe loved the responsive crowd. It was just a good concert and you'd enjoy being there.<br /><br />The Christina Aguilera disc is hard for me to rate. Although I liked the music and performance, it was not my type of most-enjoyable music so I'd probably give it four stars on that basis alone. However, this is one of the better concert DVDs I own, and I think that merits bumping the whole production up to five stars.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007HO392S|5.0|Carrie loves challenges - it's obvious in this album, Carrie cowrote 8 of the tracks including five of my favorites Wine After Whiskey, Cupid's Got a Shotgun, Two Black Cadillacs, See You Again,and Good in Goodbye - she brings her brilliant vocals to songs that have a great message, tell a story, that are fun, that make you sad, that make you cry,  - this album has everything a good collection of songs should do - I play the whole album through, don't skip one song. Carrie was hands on in the production of this album, she took her time and this is a great result. Other fav tracks- Blown Away and Forever Changed, but all the songs are unique and wonderful.

0345803485|5.0|E. L. James... pleassssssssssse continue the Fifty Shades series. There is so much more scope, and I honestly couldn't get enough of the story as it developed.<br /><br />Whilst I concur the sex was a little repetitive, then hey, the book is an erotic romance, so I guess that is to some extent expected. The story though as the romance developed, how Christian and Anastasia both developed and broke through new barriers to form a healthy relationship together, from what could only be described as toxic at the beginning, is a true inspiration within the story.<br /><br />Loved the action aspects, and how pretty full-on their life was that showed little boring elements.<br /><br />Please write more with Fifty Shades and continue the story. There is so much to read prior to meeting Anastasia, how their lives develop after the prologue, etc.<br /><br />More please....

Disks 2 & 3 still seemed like rambling, but not as bad, or I was getting used to it by then.<br />  All n all , not one of Ellens better CD's<br />Have one of her stand up CD's and two of her TV shows and like them a lot more than this CD.<br />I still think Ellens comedy is good, I think she is funny<br /><br />Hope Ellen does more comedy CD's and DVD's in the future

0385534639|4.0|\\"The circus arrives without warning. No announcements precede it. It is simply there, when yesterday it was not.\\"<br />  If the first page of this book does not draw you in I will be amazed.  I have heard about this book for a while now and have often found myself in the book shoppe caressing it, holding the pages to my face and breathing in its very essence. Yet, I always place it back on the shelf, saying to myself  soon, soon I will come back and you will be mine.<br />  Then I joined a  Goodreads Group 'The Popularity Contest' I finally was forced to buy it and it proved every bit as magical as I had hoped.<br />  Morgenstern weaved an enchanting story, pulling the reader in with every turn of the page.  Just when you thought you had the story figured out, she proved you wrong.<br />  What I liked about this story is that it was not first and foremost a \\"love\\" story.  Too often, for me, this is the case in books and I like how that took a backseat to circus.<br />  There were, however, a few things that muddled my mind as I read. One was the date hopping.  I had to go back more than a few time to review what year I had been in the last chapter, or what year these particular characters where in the last time I was reading about them.  Another would be the name hopping... at one point she would refer to someone as, for instance, Mr. Barris and another time as Ethan. Which normally is not such a big deal, but there are a lot of characters in this book and this only confused things.<br />  Morgenstern's writing reminds me of my own; she even uses one of my favourite way of saying 'except'...\\"save\\".  However, I feel that she overused this expression and on a number of occasions could have reworded her sentences better and avoided it. Mostly though the language proved to be fresh and interesting and I reveled in her descriptions of the circus... to the point that I even visited the circus in my dreams.<br />  After reading this book there is only one thing I want... and that is more! I want to learn what happens to Baily and Poppet... and Chandresh... all of them.  There is more story to tell here and I hope that Ms. Morgenstern continues to tell it.nd that is more!

B0000035E7|5.0|I have been a music fan since I was a child.  Nirvana showed me how much music has evolved. This is a very good example of their power, appeal, and raw talent. About a girl, my favorite, sounds very Beatleish, and I read that Kurt wrote it after listening to the first Beatle record over and over all night. I guess he understood! By the way I am 60 years old!
0345803485|4.0|I read the book in 1 full day, I felt practically useless because of it. I did nothing but read. The book held my attention, more specifically Christian and Ana held my attention. I think their relationship was pretty spot on for how any very innocent girl would feel being thrown into the situation she was.<br /><br />Yes, the book was a tad repetitive in some areas, but at least the repetitiveness kept it more organized than the author only mentioning \\"inner goddess\\" once and not coming back to it at all. Her inner goddess was one of Ana's way of coping with herself and sorting through problems. Who doesn't talk to themselves every once a while, some more than others? As for the words, \\"smirk,\\" \\"flush/blush,\\" etc, yes it did become slightly annoying but the author put it into words that most people can relate to. Two bold personalities are put together, \\"rolling eyes\\" and \\"smirking\\" is going to happen, and most people can relate to those terms.<br /><br />All in all, I can't complain about much. How do you enjoy something if you look for something wrong in everything? Enjoy the book, don't over analyze it, just read and enjoy..

B004MC8CA2|3.0|Good Bible app with lots of features.<br />Pros : daily Bible plans for many different aspects of daily life, different versions, downloadable versions,  connects to social media sites like Facebook and Twitter<br />Cons:  crashes a lot which can trump all the pros
B003VON1S0|4.0|This album doesn't compare with my favorite Night at the Opera, but with five solid long songs, it's well worth the investment.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I have tried several, but I always keep coming back to YouVersion. It even works great on my Android-converted HP Touchpad.
B000ZNQEMU|3.0|Is this product suppose to be the actual small Stormtrooper Lego figure on a keychain? I received a Stormtrooper keychain, that is x4 the size of the original Lego figure, that haves LED lights installed in its feets. The Stormtrooper Lego Flashlight Figure haves two LED lights inside the square holes of its feets. There's a rectangular button on its chest that, when pressed, turns on the LED lights. Both LED lights are really powerful in the dark. I'd say the figure is about 3.5 inches tall and 1.5 inches wide. I like the flashlight keychain that I received, but it wasn't what I wanted. I wanted the normal LEGO Stormtrooper Figure, as seen on the product image, on a keychain so that I could mod it and wear it as a necklace.<br /><br />~Max

B007ZD17XO|5.0|Had hours (and hours!)of fun playing the Montezuma series elsewhere; this one's my favorite so when I saw it here for the kf of course I snapped it up. This is one of the only timer-based games that I actually like - if you're not familiar with it, you get one minute to rack up points but there are so many points to be racked, what with the amazingly creative power ups, complete with cool effects. Just buy it and be done with it, I say.
B006ZCWU5K|1.0|His whole stance seems insincere, claims to stand for the poor, but it sounds like he's forcing himself to play this role over and over again for the sake of writing a song about it. For a decade since Rising he's been putting out uninspired music and the songs are always plain. I don't consider him to be sincere, but like other writers have said, he seems to be faking his working class image in his songs and live. And equally in his state of delusion he lends his support to fakes like Obama who like Bush is a cheap empty suit politician. He woos every group telling them they can count on him, waving a wand with one hand saying it's all right while hurting people at home and abroad with the other hand. If Bruce was serious, he would stop worrying about supporting some of these crooks, and see clearly enough beyond their \\"smooth\\" talk ... the same kind of smooth talk he puts into his lyrics. Yeah, he paints all these different pictures of desolation, but it rings hollow. He sounds like a presidential speech writer, \\"we hear your sorrow, we understand your pain, it's hard\\". It's worn thin ...
B007JWKLMO|4.0|Well, the film is great, where I issues with the CD Vol 1 release (probably many more to come & reviewed it recently ) this was fantastic look at George's life. My only complaint is that it covered The Beatles years far too long and went through the solo years too fast. The film shows throughout how George felt spiritual belief was becoming far more important then chart success (if it covered his Cloud 9 period you would have seen he really enjoyed chart success). Then again it we don't see as much of what he liked in the material sense as much as the title of the films name (and title of his second album by the way). The Beatles portion was a \\"5\\" but gave it a \\"4\\" due to the fact it skipped over his solo career too fast. It covers \\"All Things Must Pass\\" well, skims over the rest of his solo work. Maybe it was a time restraint, nevertheless I would recommend it to anyone wondering how good George became at the close of The Beatles break-up. Back to the material world vs the spiritual world. A lot was put on the religious beliefs etc but skimmed over what material things he loved. It did mention racing but maybe it was because he was fortunate to have had money to do things and looked into the things money could not buy. Well, I think I've taken up enough of your time & go out and get the DVD & be your own judge. Drop by my website some @ \\"JudeMac Forever & say \\"Hi\\".

1594203059|5.0|One of the most significant books I've read this year. It's puts in perspective the inter-relationship between all the parts of this global community and how we either \\"stand or fall together\\".
0307956350|2.0|I looked forward to reading this book after seeing the favorable reviews. However, a potentially engaging and engrossing story was muted by an author whose main goal seemed to be to impress the reader with how much he knew about Luxembourg and other European locations. The characters and dialogue were wooden and one-dimensional and the story was fairly predictable.
B0072PUC7W|5.0|Despite other negative reviews you will see, I feel this is Armin's overall best in a long time!  I normally am not the biggest fan of the 'On the Beach' CD, but this one is probably his best to date.  It is loaded with too many vocal Trance tracks, but even those are listenable & good tracks.  I was expecting 2012 to suck from all the negative reviews, but it definitely does not.  CD2 is where you will find the good stuff!  Similar sounding tracks, yes, but we are talking about Trance!  The CD flows from one track to the next so perfectly, and it just keeps getting better from track to track.  Also, from what I had read about lots of vocal tracks, CD2 only has two, and they don't come until near the end of the set.  I've listened to CD2 a ton this past month!<br /><br />I have every State of Trance since 2004, and while I'm not sure this is the best, I'd definitely say it's in the top three or four for sure.  I always like to listen to mix-sets several times before making up my mind on how I feel about it and before I review it here.<br /><br />I wanted to review ASOT 2012 to show some support for an awesome set by Armin, and I hope he can get back the #1 ranking on DJ Mag Poll.  It makes me wanna puke that a house DJ has number one.  Thanks, Armin, and I'll be ready for ASOT 2013!<br /><br />UPDATE:  I cannot stop listening to CD2 (In the Club)!  It may be up there with the greatest single disc of Trance I have ever heard.  George Acosta's Miami CD2, Ferry Corsten Once Upon a Night (Vol. 1) CD2, The Thrillseekers Nightmusic Vol 3 (CD1), and most of Christopher Lawrence's CDs come to mind as absolute treasures.  The second CD on ASOT 2012 is right up there.  The final track on it is the only slightly weak track, but this CD is so amazing!  I just had to share more of my thoughts.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|While the writing will never win any awards for technical skill, and it isn't anywhere in the vicinity of a literary classic, for some reason I just couldn't put it down until the last volume was finished. In spite of the oft repetetive wordage and the continuous emotional roller coaster that would have brought an actual mortal to their psychological knees long before the ending, there is just something about Ana's journey and growth through this treacherous minefield of the heart, that charms the reader and kept me avidly turning the pages. Some of the erotic scenes indeed have their moments, although that is the main area where the author seemed to retread and wear out the same phrases much too often, by the end of the first book... but it was the ups and downs and all-arounds of the actual whirlwind (tornado?) romance that drew me in and kept me reading early into the wee hours. This one is not for the romantically faint-of-heart. The TV pundits may decry the books' apparent beginning framework of 'rich, powerful man debasing, controlling and corrupting an innocent, helpless young girl' as yet another example of male chauvinism and control over women in the modern era- but they obviously didn't read the whole trilogy. If they had, they'd have realised that even a powerful man's heart isn't immune to the velvet Steele of bondage.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I first heard of this book by way of a friend and decided to finally read it.  I will say with all honesty I had not heard of it and had not heard any of the reviews.  As I was reading it, all I could think was \\"Is this for real?  This is \\"Twilight\\" rewritten.  I went online to read the reviews and then looked up the authors bio.  Here is where I found that the author claims to have been \\"inspired\\" by the Stephenie Meyer's \\"Twilight\\" series and it prompted her to write her own version of the story on a fan fiction site.  Apparently she moved her story to her own site and it had a large following.  From what I found, originally, being that it was a fan fiction story, she had all the characters named as they were in the Twilight books.  Eventually, she removes the fan ficition story from her site, decides to put pen to paper (or fingers to a keyboard) and writes the story to hopefully be published and changes the names.<br /><br />I think any author would feel honored to have someone tell them they are \\"inspired\\" by their work.  But this is no honor to any author, Stephenie Meyer, or any other.  It's stolen material, characters, and plot. Period.  I don't understand why she felt just changing the names would somehow make her story more credible, or that their are actually people out there who admire her work.  What work did she put into this?  She took the carefully laid plans and character bios from someone else, added a little salt and pepper, and put her name on it.  Sorry, but I can't respect that.<br /><br />This is just a small portion of the stolen plot and characters that shows up page after page of this story.<br /><br />Similarities between Edward Cullen (Twilight) & Christian Grey:<br />*Their birthdays are in June.<br />*Both are extremely rich.<br />*Both are extremely controlling.<br />*Edward is telepathic, and Ana thinks Christian is telepathic because it's as though \\"he can read her mind.\\"<br />*Both are extremely jealous.<br />*Both claim their womanas \\"mine\\".<br />*Both are extreme lovers of music and have eclectic music taste from Indie Rock to Classical.<br />*Both play the piano and are masters at it.<br />*Both are able to \\"dazzle\\" women simply by gazing into their eyes.<br />*Both are heart achingly \\"beautiful\\" to look at.<br />*Both constantly make their women hot with their \\"crooked\\" smile.<br />*Both have dark pasts that make them unable to feel emotions for that \\"special someone\\" until either Bella or Ana show up in their lives.<br />*Both have a love for fast and very expensive cars.<br />*Both are adopted into their families.<br />*Both have extreme mood swings.<br />*Edward warns Bella that he is \\"dangerous, no good for her, she should stay away\\". Christian warns Ana that he is \\"dangerous, no good for her, she should stay away\\". both male characters tell their female characters that they \\"can't stay away from them\\" while both female characters tell them, \\"then don't.\\"<br />*Both Edward and Christian make the same comment to their female love interests.  That comment is \\"I'm breaking all the rules now.\\"<br /><br />Similarities between Bella (Twilight) and Ana:<br />*Both have birthdays in September.<br />*Both are abnormally clumsy.<br />*Both are only children.<br />*Both can cook well and enjoy to.<br />*Both talk in their sleep and their love interests love staying awake to hear what they say.<br />*Both have had to be more of a parent to their actual parents, in the terms of \\"taking care of them\\".<br />*Both allow their controlling and bossy love interests take charge over their lives.<br />*Bella drives an old beat-up Chevy.  Ana drives an old beat-up Beetle.<br />*Both are lovers of literature, especially the classics.<br />*Both are virgins.<br />*Both have mothers who are divorced, quirky, not always responsible, always going from one interest to the next, need to be taken care of by their daugthers, etc.<br />*Both moved in with their fathers after their mothers remarried.<br />*Both havefathers who are very into sports and fishing.<br />*Both live in Washington State.<br />*Both have mothers who moved to the South (Bella's to Florida and Ana's to Georgia).<br />*Both lived with their mothers in the desert (Bella in Phoenix and Ana in Las Vegas).<br />*Both have never felt any strong attraction to a guy until they meet the love interest in their stories.<br />*Both have male friends who are interested in them romantically but don't feel the same way.  Bella had Jacob and Ana has Jose.<br />*Both of these male interests steal kisses from them and it's unwanted.  Jacob steals his kiss from Bella in Eclipse and Jose steals one from Ana.  Both women become pissed at them but eventually forgive them for it.<br />*Jacob's father sells the beat up old pick-up to Bella's father in Twilight for Bella to drive and Jacob is the mechanic who works on it for her.<br />Jose's father sells the beat up old Beetle to Ana's father for Ana to drive and Jose is the mechanic who works on it for her.<br />*Both of their boyfriends hate their old cars, find them unsafe for them to be driving, and in turn by them expensive brand new cars to drive.<br />*Bella's father and Jacobs father are close friends who fish and watch sports together in Twilight.  Ana and Jose's father are close friends who fish and watch sports together.<br />*Bella's mother can't attend her graduation ceremony because her husband \\"Phil\\" has hurt himself and she has to stay home to care for him.<br />Ana's mother can't attend her graduation ceremony because her husband \\"Bob\\" has hurt himseld and she has to stay home to care for him.<br /><br />That's just the copying of the character bio's.  Page after page were scenes that were directly out of Twilight itself.  The scene where Christian and Ana go out to eat and the waitress is \\"dazzled\\" by Christians looks and dumbfounded.  After she walks away, Ana tells Christian that it's not fair that he has this effect on women and does he realize it?  This isthe same scene from when Edward and Bella go out to dinner in Twilight and Bella tells Edward that it's not fair the effect he has on women and how the waitress was \\"dazzled\\" by him.  There are so many copied scenes like this throughout the book.  So many.<br /><br />The list can go on and on.  This is being \\"inspired\\" by an author to write your own story? This author could have taken the characters and built on them from her own imagination.  There is absolutely no reason she had to copy their bios and their traits to the extent that she did.  She could have easily had Christian and Ana be who they are, without all the added copying from Twilight to make this story her own.<br /><br />I don't see this author as being inspired.  I see her as a fraud.
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|Perfect for the beach or long airplane ride.  I finished the book in one sitting.  Thoroughly enjoyed the well-paced plot.
B007Z9RAX4|3.0|I love movies with female protagonists, and especially gorgeous, or at least pretty females, that can perform believable fight scenes.<br /><br />This woman must have been a stunt double most of her career, to date. She is very athletic, has a fantastic body and is not bad looking. However, her acting dialog ability is pitiful. She sounds like she's reading.<br /><br />I would watch future movies with her in them though. As a matter of fact, I'm going to search for movies that she has stared in, or co-stared in and check them out. I believe she, with some acting lessons, will be a real contender for female action movie star of the near future.<br /><br />PS:  What the hell was up with the last two scenes of the movie? It looks as if she gained 15-20 lbs before the shooting, or vise versa, she lost 15-20 lbs after shooting those scenes. The former is more likely IMO.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it! It reminds me of super Mario brothers! I highly recommend downloading this one!<br />the controls work really well and the graphics are cute!
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I started reading the book out of curiosity as soon as my Kindle Fire arrived. I didn't even think about all the fuss going about an erotic fiction novel like this taking avid readers by storm. It comes as no surprise to me how Anastasia Steele fits together in this horribly astounding sexual world of Christian Grey. Probably a lot of men dream to be this guy, though not as much as to the extent of his disturbing behavior and dominance.<br /><br />The book is quite well-written; I get to imagine what it is like in the world of the characters and the POV of Ana does really share plenty of witty and sexual detail (at most parts). Some real life issues arise, like abuse & even world hunger for some reason that are interesting in the development of Fifty Shades. Christian Grey, a man that has no idea about love, relationships and commitment but has awfully plenty of knowledge with sex, BDSM and control, meets Anastasia Steele, a college graduate who, innocent at first, gets entangled in his wild and confusing world filled in a DOM/SUB contract. She is definitely not the submissive he's ever expected or perhaps ever loved?<br /><br />The quest to find out the deep, sexual world of Fifty Shades is something that doesn't get understood easily so remember to read at your own risk and who knows, you might get hooked with this. Kudos to E. L. James
B005MMJ84K|5.0|These books are both great. It was totally predictable that Lena would fall for Julian but I didn't think Alex would come back......I'm trying to figure out where they're gonna go with this. I cant wait for the last book to come out. I don't know how Oliver will end this but I definitely cant wait! I totally recommend this to anyone who believes in true love.
B007XKEY6Q|5.0|I think this app is great for anybody its fun and they come up with really cool words so get this app

1878424319|5.0|This book had been recommonded twice within 1.5 weeks by individuals so thought i needed to read it. once i read it decided to get for numerous people i care about hoping they would be inspired as i had. It is a wonderful book to read over and over again. It is common sense yet reminds you to be aware of yourself and be mindful of what you may take granted. its a quick read and very inspiring. hope you enjoy it as i have. :)
0345803485|3.0|Over kill when it comes to SEX.  I love sex ,myself, but this is crazy!  Christain is border line crazy and a preditor. Surely the author could have come up with more of a story about real life. There is more to life than this author covered.  As a college graduate Ana is not using her mind. I see no need to buy the other books of this author.  Why did this book get so much TV coverage?
B007V2UGPE|4.0|very fun. just started from beginning again after my son erased my first one. :( was all the way to 47-4, such a disappointment! would recommend to friends.
B007SSDS24|4.0|Movie was decent better than most I've seen lately. Kind of reminded me of war of the worlds. The action was great and not to bad of an ending.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|For anyone who has not heard about this book, they must be living under a rock. But to add my comments, OMG!!!  What a book. Can't wait to get the other two in the trilogy.
B000002J2B|5.0|This is one of the most progressive rock albums in the Genesis catalog. Keyboard dominated music on most of the cuts, with some wonderful mellow tunes and dark progressive rock. \\"Blood on the Rooftops\\" is one of the most beautiful songs ever written by the band. \\"The Eleventh of Mar\\" and \\"One For The Vine,\\" are classic keyboard dominated progressive rock songs. \\"Unquiet slumbers for the sleepers...Afterglow\\" is some of the most exciting few minutes in prog rock history. The song \\"Afterglow\\" is pop and progressive and one of the best songs done by any band.<br /><br />This is not one of their best sellers because fans of the Phil Collins era think its too progressive and the progressive fans thinks its beginning of the sell out. It is much more electric that the previous \\"Trick of The Tail,\\"  and to me that makes if the best Genesis without Peter Gabriel.  If you are into neo prog you should listen to this one. If you like Peter Gabriel era Genesis you should listen to this one. If you like Porcupine Tree you should listen to this one. If you like Steve Hacketts solo stuff, you should listen to this one. You get the point.<br /><br />There would never be another progressive album like it as Steve Hackett lost his influence in the band. Four song writers is too much and one had to go. Tony Banks wrote most of this album and would write most of the progressive style stuff in the Phil Collins Band era. It is a 5 star progressive rock album and a must in your collection. The 1994 Definitive edition remasters are excellent with a very true sound recorded at the right volume.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|After you get past the the first few chapters in the first book you will them. Such a great book and you will fall in love with Christian and Ana.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love reading and using this app because it is so easy to read other versions.  I have several that I like to compare and too heavy to lug to Bible study.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I didn't find this to be a very good read.  It is not written very well and I really did not find the sex hot.  I like romances that involve a loving relationship.  I don't think this falls under that description.  Christian grew on me by the 2nd and 3rd books, which were better.  The story line gets better.  If she cut out about half of the sex the books would have been better.
B0058EBNAO|4.0|I love this app. The alerts are great - they let me know about frost advisories and inclement weather. The only thing I don't like is the tiny icons for the wind direction. They are so small that I can't tell which direction they are pointing to. They look like lines instead of arrows.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|this is a very fun and addictive game but it is kind of bloody so not recommended for little kids.
B006DHAT5K|5.0|If you are wondering why you should see this movie, see the title. The movie played to its strengths and showed Chris Evans sans clothing numerous times, with very little shielding you from his more... important bits. Have you seen those abs? Combined with that face? HELLO.<br /><br />I'm sorry, was I reviewing a movie? I got a little lost there.<br /><br />A lot of the reviews I read were criticizing What's Your Number for being predictable, which confused me. It's a romantic comedy. Were you expecting Shakespeare? When I settle down for a rom com, I'm not looking to be shocked by the plot. I'm looking to laugh, root for the main characters, want the main characters to get together, drool over the male lead (and drool I definitely did, have you noticed?) as well as identify with the female one. I was able to do all of that, therefore I walked out of the movie theater content and pleased. I have recommended this movie to others and was very, very happy with it, going by that criteria. When I watch a rom com, I'm not looking to have my life changed, I just want to forget about everything for an hour and whatever minutes.<br /><br />On that note, Chris Evans and Anna Faris were adorable together and did help me forget life for awhile. Faris was, for me, super relatable and flawless. The two had excellent chemistry and carried what could have been a better script. I have bought this movie and plan on squirreling it away for rainy days when I just want to curl up in bed and eat chocolate and appreciate the male form in all its wonder.<br /><br />Have I mentioned I really like Chris Evans? And his body/face combo? I might be a little biased. I'll stop gushing and go now.
B0054TVW04|4.0|This book was refreshing in that the author, highly acclaimed academic and historian, uses a style that the common man can read and understand.  I found him balanced and honest in his assessment of our culture and where it is headed.  Mr. Ferguson definitely cranks up the \\"thought meter\\" for all who objectively receive what he has to say.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love playing this game because its fun and there is a lot of games to choose from.The best 101-in-1 games ive ever played.
B003O86FMW|1.0|In 2008 This was never heard of when it first came out and now all of a sudden it's popular now after Harry Potter and Twilight are over? I read the first HG book and yes it is good but I won't let a ten year old or under to read this and I'm sure people over 30 won't read this because it's a Teen Romance type. Teen Romance books = Snore for many people now after Twilight ruined the meaning of it. I saw the preview for this at the very last HP movie but once I read the second book to this I had no desire to see the movie. I never even finished the series. This series is HORRIBLE. Kids killing kids just for a TV show is bad enough. You need a idea that will get a number of different readers to actually pick it up and read the book. Did you expect a wide variety of readers ranging from all ages to read this? Take Twilight for example (yes I know its a bad book but bear with me). Twilight had this same kind of plot. A Pain in the Butt brat who the author made to look like a superhero. Bella = No emotion stuck up brat while Katniss = The girl who makes readers want to stab this book and pick up a Twilight book. I never liked Katniss. She is the girl who is suppose to bring Peace? She kills people in this book! That's not making peace! Eh if I had to choose I would like Peta because he shows courage. Yes I am a HP fan and yes you HG fans can hate me but I love love LOVE. Hp. Another thing. What is Katniss's true weakness? In stories: ALL MAJOR CHARACTERS MUST HAVE A WEAKNESS. Bella = Edward Harry= Friends and Family Katniss = What? Mathias needs a true weakness or she is called a run on character. A run on character means the author gives the major character. God like powers but no weakness so you can never defeat them. I can see Prim being one of her weaknesses but did she give up on the games cause of her? No so she isn't her true weakness. I'm not bashing the whole series. I'm just bashing this book. This book ruined my desire to read the last one. I'm sorry but I rather use my imagination then stab trying to stab this book with my pencil. Harry Potter = A good book that actually makes you use your imagination while HG nah you can read it and not imginae anything and still know what happens. I can't believe this book is up against Harry Potter. Sorry my vote is for Characters with a little flaw but are still great heros. Katniss.... She symbolizes a bratty whiny girl who wants everything done her way or she wont do it.her use my imagination then stab trying to stab this book with my pencil. Harry Potter = A good book that actually makes you use your imagination while HG nah you can read it and not imginae anything and still know what happens.

B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was looking for content for my new Kindle when I came across reviews of Wool.  So many reviewers wrote of non-stop reading.  Wow, were my fellow readers ever right!  Good thing I was on vacation because Wool is the kind of book you shut the office door for.  Mr. Howey, if HBO or SyFy hasn't optioned Wool yet I'll pay you a hundred bucks TODAY, cash money!  I look forward to the next installment and catching up your other works. Like many others I also await a treatment on screen that does justice to the world you created. Having read some of the author's website I must implore him: Please Mr Howey, once you make it big, and you will, resist your publisher's urging to stretch out the stories with page upon page of meaningless exposition intended to justify that hardcover (or even Kindle) price but adding nothing to the reader's experience but irritation and a search for new authors to follow.  S.M. Stirling, George R.R. Martin, Harry Turtledove, et al, take note; return to the roots now being tended by Hugh Howey.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|just because there is NOadds does NOT make the game better. it is just adds!! 99&cent; JUST FOR NO ADDS gosh
0345803485|5.0|I love this book! The intensity of Christian's character is whats got me sold. I think a majority of women who have read this book found themselves daydreaming just as I have found myself imagining they were experiencing what Ana was.A lot more men should be reading perhaps pick up a few tips.
B007SYWFRM|5.0|I love this game! its so animated and colorful! everything looks just like the movie! its much more fun than just some zoo game! (although those are fun too)
B007J4T2G8|1.0|This is a terrible book. Completely redundant and poorly written but OK, if it was great erotica - but it isn't. I think it is a best seller because people who never read good erotica before started buying it. If you want good erotica read My Secret Garden. In fact - read anything but this awful, slow moving, stupid, poorly written nonsense about a relationship between two really sick people.
0553288105|1.0|The big selling point of this novel is the psychology, which draws on Freud's theory. A lot of psychologists say the theory is flawed.
0345803485|4.0|When I described these books to my husband, I said, \\"Pretty Woman\\" with S&M.  It is pure rescue fantasy.  It is totally unbelievable, yet impossible to put down.  The hooks are the author's ability to make us care about the characters, her ability to create suspense, and our wishful belief in a \\"happy ever after.\\"<br /><br />In case you are curious, this is not a literary thing of beauty.  Her word choice is extremely repetitive.  There are some very flat characters and many improbable situations.  If you can't read it for its merits, some good characters, a somewhat compelling plot, interesting female-focused erotica, and good conquering evil, then skip it.<br /><br />Leave it to others to make the author rich.

B007PS0X0W|3.0|Vampire vs. Lycan rematch<br /><br />Ultimately this film repeats the predictable and successful devices used to create the small franchise.  Vampires battling Lycans to the death, tons of gun play, minimal storyline supported by ample action, and Kate Beckinsale's latex outfit testing the structural integrity of viewers' zippers.  Sure, there is a hybrid daughter storyline used as a first step in the next spiral staircase of this series, and a little subterfuge, but both are actually afterthought in the grand scheme bullets, FX, and latex.<br /><br />The major negatives of this film revolve around lighting and sound.  Adapting to the vampire/night motif is one thing; filming with engine oil over the camera lens during an eclipse is something completely different.  In other words, tons of scenes - some major actions sequences - too dark to discern.  The sound is equally egregious.  There are large stretches of filming with a distracting bass rumble that not only detracts from the overall viewing pleasure, but also causes headaches.  Hint: Every once in a while move your hand to the other side of the synthesizer.<br /><br />Diehard fans of the series will enjoy the film immensely.  Others with mixed emotions will probably be disappointed like me.

Settle down, people. \\"Making Mirrors\\" is making millions, yes. But will it make its mark in music history a hundred years from now? Probably not. I've listened to this CD several times now and I just don't get the earth shattering experience that other listeners seem to be getting. Could it be we're just desperate for something new that we will latch onto anything that seems eclectic even it's not necessarily original? I'm just asking.

B0083GQKQG|1.0|We cannot imagine why anyone would give this movie 5 stars.  It was disjointed, poorly acted, and kind of sick.  Having never read Dante's Inferno, maybe we just didn't get the symbolism.  It is a really sad story that was not that well told.  We watched to the end hoping for a good ending that would make sense of it all, but this didn't happen.  We regret having paid 4 dollars to rent it.

0439023513|2.0|First off, I can understand all the people giving the series 5 stars. They were entertained by it, they couldn't put the book down, they loved the characters, the showing of what military heroes go through, the romance, etc. I understand all that, and the book series is 5 stars for them. However, I'm writing a review coming from someone who reads political nonfiction and science. I generally hate all fiction, regardless of what it is, with rare exception. I hated reading \\"the classics\\" in gradeschool, highschool, and college. Books like \\"1984\\" are the rare exception of books I enjoy reading. So why did I even pick up the series to begin with?<br /><br />After all the commotion on how good the hunger games movie is, I gave in and went to see it. As a recent college grad struggling to find a job, the movie hit a cord with me, and the romance I also found intriguing. I wanted to find out what would happen next, so bought the second book ($20). I was unhappy about how much Collins summarized. I was interested in the relationship between Peeta and Katniss, I wanted to be there for so many moments that were just summarized. I felt, ok, this author just rushed through this book. Collins just wants to make money. Even though I was upset by how much was summarized, I still couldn't put the book down, I went on. I felt emotionally connected to Katniss and Peeta. I finished the book the day I bought it.<br /><br />I couldn't handle it, I had to buy the third book (another $20). The story became cartoonish. I stopped caring about the logic of the story line and the politics involved. I wanted to read more about the two. Collins refuses to give us much. When at the end, Peeta finally shows up for her. In less than half a page, Collin finally lets Katniss fall in love with Peeta. Really Collins? You're only willing to spend half a page? Then the rest of their lives, we get about 2 pages. That just pissed me off. It was such an unsatisfying finish.<br /><br />Again, I understand everyone that gives it 5 stars. For me, I'm donating my copies to the library. And unless the future films deviate from the book, which means much more Peeta/Katniss, I'm not going to watch it.

B0067PEDLE|4.0|Finally! I had a hard time lately with finding entertaining books that don't disappoint me as soon as I start reading them. It doesn't seem that hard with the large offer of books you have nowadays, does it? Yeah right... I've read a lot of books last month and the highest I could give them was a lousy OK. Even that was hard in some cases. Hence the absence of any sign of life on this site;) Those books were not even worth of spending more time with them by writing a review...<br /><br />But enough about those books, now I want to talk about the book that got me out of the rut. What a great book Perfect Chemistry is! As usual this book has been on my long to read list for a while, but you'll never know how much you'll like or hate a book with just looking at the cover  . But this one definitely belongs in the first category! I loved reading every minute of it, except maybe the ending, but I'll explain that part later  .<br /><br />First of all I like it when there are two persons bickering in a book. Not fighting, but bickering and eventually fall in love. And keep bickering, that last part is important  . Those are my favorite books to read, so I really liked the beginning of this one. It was also nice to not read about love or attraction at first sight.<br /><br />That was very refreshing to read. Nowadays you see a lot of YA were the story starts with the transfer of a new boy into the school. I've read enough of those books to start finding it annoying. It's too coincidental. But none of that in Perfect Chemistry and because Brittany and Alex have heard rumors about each other it's very fun to read which prejudice they have about each other and how they react when they start to see through them and learn the real person.<br /><br />And now something about Alex and Brittany. I loved both of them, although Alex was a little too hot-headed sometimes and set on using violence to solve stuff. I'm not that keen on using your fists to solve things  But I do admire him for trying to look after his family on such a young age. Brittany, too, hasn't had an easy time with such parents and having to take care of her disabled sister. I loved seeing how she's prepared to keep looking after her. I only had a problem with her choice of boyfriend, but that solved itself during the book<br /><br />As I mentioned earlier I didn't like the ending very much. The book kinda builds to this scene, but for me it didn't have to end like this. It also ended a little too quick and I couldn't get my feelings into it. Otherwise I think I would have definitely cried. It was as if I could read between the lines and knew what was going to happen. So it wasn't exactly exciting. And what happened afterwards wasn't really logical to me, but oh well there could be worse things  Sorry for my very cryptic description of the ending but I don't want to spoil it for the rest of you<br /><br />I also had a hard time with the Spanish/Portuguese used in the book. In the Netherlands you don't use it much, so I didn't get a single thing what Alex and his family said at times...<br /><br />My conclusion: 4 stars. It was a very nice read with captivating protagonists. A little bit too violent at times and the ending wasn't as good as the rest of the story, otherwise this book would have gotten 5 stars. Although I liked this book very much I'm not planning to read and review the next books in this series. What I've read in the blurbs looks too much like the story in Perfect Chemistry, all be it with different protagonists...for trying to look after his family on such a young age.

B0059XTUEK|5.0|When I watched this film, for the first couple of minutes I was like, \\"That's Michelle Williams playing Marilyn Monroe.\\"  After that I was like, \\"That's Marilyn Monroe.\\"  Michelle is head and shoulders above all the others playing Marilyn these days, e.g., the three actresses on \\"Smash\\".
B001TKD4ZI|3.0|This book started very promising. A vampire loosing his teeth because he's trying to suck blood from a sex doll? All for scientific reasons of course, but still it made me laugh out loud and afterwards I couldn't stop snickering. Hilarious! After that it went a little downhill and the story became a lot more serious. Okay being chased by the Russian mob is a very serious business, but I'd loved to get some more funny events.<br /><br />Not that the rest of the story wasn't intriguing, but I missed a bit of the humor that was so very present at the beginning of the book. As I came closer to the end of the book, it looked more and more as the usual paranormal romance with vampires. Such a shame after such a great beginning! Although the fact that vampires don't seem to have a reflection in mirrors was quite fascinating. I've never understood how that could be possible. Even when something's death it still has a reflection, hasn't it?<br /><br />Roman and Shanna are a nice couple. I just thought that there was a bit too much attention paid to the fact that Roman was still struggling with his past. Especially with his Catholic background. I know people from the Middle Ages were very religious, but to think that it's his fault,even after all those YEARS is a bit too much. He didn't decide to become a \\"monster\\"! That was a bit too much drama for my taste.<br /><br />Shanna is very spunky, I like that in a heroin. She took the bull by the horns and didn't wait for her knight in shining armor to rescue her. Especially liked that last part ^^ Although I was very surprised she had so much doubts about her and Roman becoming a couple. Finally someone who thinks about all the consequences of dating a vampire instead of just falling head over heels in love. I didn't agree with the decision she made at the end, but she still has time to change her mind<br /><br />Overall rating 3 stars. As I said the beginning was superb, but then it went down with some notches. Nonetheless a nice story to read, although a bit too dramatic at times for my tastee story to read, although a bit too dramatic at times for my taste

B0071WQ7WU|4.0|Shinedown's newest offering \\"Amaryllis\\" shoots out of the gate firing on all cylinders much like \\"The Sound of Madness\\" did with its album opener \\"Devour\\".  According to lead singer/ songwriter Brent Smith the guys intended to \\"make their best album yet and make every song a masterpiece, an emotional tour-de-force\\" (my paraphrase, not an actual quote; the album liner's actual quote says \\"Don't be delicate...be vast and brilliant\\").  That's one of the flaws on this still likable and very good album (I think that the one and two stars are unfair and more a matter of disappointment after expectations were set so high with the phenomenal \\"The Sound of Madness\\") and, IMO, there are two main flaws: 1) every song tries to hit a home run and while many come close they all miss to some degree and (2) the songs don't do quite enough to differentiate themselves from one another; especially toward the end of the record they start to wash each other out.  Now these criticisms aren't to say that there aren't some nice touches on the album as there are such as the use of a children's choir on the song \\"Bully\\".  Their use of an orchestra works well on songs like \\"Unity\\" and \\"I'm Not Alone\\" but is otherwise unimpressive on the rest of the album.  All in all this is a very strong effort from a very powerful rock band.  I for one look forward to what they have in store for their fans in the future and appreciate them trying to overachieve on an album.<br /><br />Highlights of the album are: the timely \\"Bully\\"; the passionate \\"Unity\\"; the blistering \\"Enemies\\"; the nice phrasing and singing of the refrain on \\"For My Sake\\"; and the song that you're gonna wanna sing along to, \\"My Name\\".  (As you can see quite a few highlights.)<br /><br />Note to parents: I have let my 3-year-old son listen to \\"The Sound of Madness\\" and have sung a couple of songs to him.  I won't be letting him listen to \\"Amaryllis\\" due to the band's poor choice of not just utilizing the f-bomb but making it prominent on one song in particular (\\"My Name [Wearing Me Out]\\") which is a very catchy song; \\"Nowhere Kids\\" is also another song to watch out for.one song in particular (\\"My Name [Wearing Me Out]\\") which is a very catchy song; \\"Nowhere Kids\\" is also another song to watch out for.

B00005Q66Y|5.0|Gunter Wand has a way with this symphony that is special.  I've always loved his \\"live\\" recording from Lubeck Cathedral, but this one is even better. First of all the acoustics are ideal.  You would be hard-pressed to find a recording with better sonics.  Second, the interpretation is just ideal.  As much as I love the Lubeck recording, a resonant cathedral is not the most suitable soundstage, and as a result the tempos sometimes drag to allow the sound to die out.  This is wonderful in its own way, but the Berlin recording has every tempo relationship spot-on, with no need to wait for 15-second sound decay.  Comparisons between the two are interesting.  I wouldn't be without either, but this one is the most successful as an interpretation.
B005LAIGPU|2.0|\\"Chronicle\\" is a frustrating film to review.<br /><br />I know the filmmakers were trying something new with the comic\superhero film genre, but the found-footage\hand-held camera work, actually, hurts the film. It's annoying to watch, especially, with the quick-cut editing.<br /><br />One of the major problems is that found-footage films barely have well-developed characters and tell awkward, rushed plots. The structure is definitely, not normal film structure.<br /><br />The first half of the film, while showing some nice special effects, is a total bore and a mess. Too many shots and short scenes of the teens playing around with their powers, for example.<br /><br />It's not until the second-half of the film, that the viewer is finally given a \\"plot\\" and a developed character (although, not well-rounded), in the form of a cliched protagonist-turned-antagonist. However, this was certainly, the best part of the film, including the rather action-packed 10 min ending.<br /><br />The film had potential to be something original and fresh, but the found-footage aspect is what ruins the experience, as well as the lack of a compelling story.<br /><br />It wouldve been interesting if the hole in the ground and it's origins were explored more, as well as developing the antagonist plot, much earlier.<br /><br />Another problem is that all the characters seem to be capable of having the same powers and of course, one of them takes their power to the extreme and become the villian of three. The fact they all share the same powers, means there's no chance to create characters with distinctive superpowers (this is no \\"Fantastic Three\\").<br /><br />For comicbook fans and sci-fi films, \\"Chronicle\\" is a film with ideas that barely add-up to anything great. Some good action\special effects sequences, overshadowed by the lack of a compelling story and interesting characters.<br /><br /> If the filmmakers ditched the found-footage concept and put more effort into the script\story, \\"Chronicle\\" couldve been something new in a sea of established comicbook films.
B000OIBY4Y|4.0|Published in 1942, Camus quite poignantly defines absurdism within fiction. Camus finds a way to develop within the reader considerable sympathy for his protagonist Meursault, who happens to be a stoically indifferent, deterministic, absurdist man-slaughterer - albeit he fails to acknowledge it as such. Meursault only perceives his physical world with very little subjectivity. Even love is hardly an emotionally subjective feeling, but rather a merely physical sensation. If any person wonders over the prospect of living life in total objectivity, then he or she ought to read this book first.<br /> Not only is The Stranger well-written modern fiction, but it finely depicts the modernity of feeling in an era of existential vacuuming; a general feeling of apathy, alienation, and atheistic hope. As hard as it is for many to do justice in defining `existentialism' or `absurdism,' The Stranger goes far in conveying its concept to the reader, which may be done all in one enjoyable sitting.
0545091020|5.0|So I noticed this book on the train actually. (Ever notice that if it's a good book you'll notice it being read by several different people for several weeks/months) That's how I track bestsellers :) (the kindle although very very cool is starting to take that away...now I have to ask strangers...\\"hey, what book is that?\\")<br /><br />Anyway. I don't review like the other folks... No grammatical dissection of the author's writing prowess! I was intrigued in the first few pages and the intrigue was kept aflame by a well written, interesting, captivating storyline. Didn't seem like the author got lost in trying to impress, just tell a story. I loved it.

B0034G4P1W|5.0|This is one of those cases where the trailers for the movie made me not want to see it ever.  I saw the trailers before many other movies and all they showed me was a bunch of slapstick humor scenes edited together which revealed nothing of the plot (or even if the movie had a plot), and I didn't think they humor was very funny.  Now that I've seen those same scenes in context in the movie I realize how funny they are.  And dumbing down the title from \\"The Pirates! An Adventure with scientists\\" to \\"The Pirates! Band of Misfits\\" was self-defeating, because all pirates are by definition misfits, aren't they?  But \\"an adventure with scientists\\" would have told me that this is no ordinary pirate movie.<br /><br />So despite the efforts of the promoters of this movie to made it look like a totally moronic waste of time, I ended up taking my two boys to the theater to see it one day when there was nothing much to do, one of the kids and I are suffering from seasonal allergies, and mom wants us out of the house.  I had a great time and am looking forward to seeing this movie again and catching things that got by me the first time through.

B000EHQ57Q|1.0|Was this 5.1 mix, mixed by a stoned 60s hippie? 5.1 means 5.1, not 4.0. There is no center channel or subwoofer action. There are parts of the songs that are either completely missing, or not where they should be. Vocals whispering in my rear speakers? WTF? Thankfully my OPPO BDP95 can select to 2 channel, which isn't a big improvement over the regular cd. Maybe the guy who mixed this album should visit the guy who remixed the old Elton John records into SACD 5.1 I know it says on the cover that it was mixed from the old quad tapes, but it shouldn't tell you 5.1 when it is not. And it carries on to the other Moody blues albums also.

B000E8NQUE|1.0|Like my other reviews of the Moody Blues so called remastered SACD releases, this one again has no center channel and insignificant subwoofer action. When it says 5.1, that's what i think i should get. Apparently not. Some stoned hippie from the sixties decided he would just take the original quad mix and slap it on a sacd. The old Elton John mixes are really remixed and fabulous. Shame on you Moody Blues.

It still helps with one handed reading though.<br />Materials all feel sturdy and dont mark easy.  The cover is aging well.

B005DI66N4|4.0|WOW! This book was incredible. It was full of suspense and i never knew what was going to happen and i love that in a book. This story has so many lessons you can learn packed into it. Although parts of the book may seem not possible, like walking 4000 miles with no map and still getting to your destination,  the book still was believable and i believed every word of it. It was enthraling and heart breaking. Parts of the book  cringed at my heart strings. All in all i enjoyed the book very much and it was VERY interesting to read. I read the book for a school report but i would have read the book even without having to for a grade. And i am sure that i will read it again. The fact that the story is actually a true story makes it that much better.

1444737090|5.0|I downloaded this book on my Kindle and read it in just two days. And I have enjoyed every minute of reading it. The story of James and Bob \\"adopting\\" each other against many odds is very heart warming. The general theme of the story is very \\"down to earth\\" (it is set in the world of street sellers/buskers after all). And yet you can't also help the feeling that Bob's arrival and commitment was nothing short of a miracle for James as it has set him towards the right path in his life. I heard it said before that animals come to our life for a reason, like little furry angels. Well, James's case is undoubtedly the best proof for that :-)<br />Both James and the cat are something of a celebrity at the moment. There are a few videos of them on the Y-tube and I was thrilled to see the pair after reading about their life and  adventures together. They even look like they belong with each other.<br />I was drawn to this book as well by the fact that it is set in London, the city that I love dearly. However, you do not get many artistic descriptions of London from the author. Rather, we can see the city through the street person's eyes, and the picture is rather cold and soulless. This way the city appears like any other world megapolis. With its constant wailing of police sirens in the background, tourist crowds, rushing business people, street sellers, drunks, small mercies and big challenges. I have been to London many times so I can see the places mentioned in the book, such as Covent Garden, and matching them with the picture above gave me a new perspective on how multi-faceted and ever-changing London really is. I also liked reading the observations of people that James makes - his reflections are fair yet respectful and no bitter in any way despite his shortcomings, which I think testifies of his inner strength and kindness as a person. I really liked the description of a police warden walking past him with a stern face, and then when she saw Bob the cat her face apparently turned human and even smiled :-)<br />All in all, I can definitely recommend this wonderful book. There is a strong hope in my heart that the amazing story of the guy and his cat has a happy ending. Best of luck and blessings to you both, James and Bob!!

0345803485|5.0|Loved this book, when you first read it, yes of coarse there is a lot of lust, but towards the end of the book, continuing into the second and third book there is a love story and you cant help but be smitten by it, youll love and hate christian grey, but in the end you end up understanding him and his ways. need to read it, keeps you on the edge of your seat, making you always want to ready more, read all 3 books in a week!

0525478817|5.0|I don't really even know how I want to start this review. This book is wonderful, in all the ways a book can be wonderful. It beautifully written and I was instantly attached to the characters. When I started this book, I read the first chapter and knew I was a goner. I knew two things when I finished that first chapter, I loved this book and I was going to cry. You can't get that emotionally attached to characters in a book about terminal cancer patients, you are going to go to pieces.<br /><br />This book is laugh out loud funny, sorrowfully sad and smart. I love John Green, I have read Looking For Alaska (which is amazing) and Paper Towns. His voice is real and authentic. It sounds like how a teenager today would talk, which is not something you get when you read Young Adult books, they often leave out the swearing and the crudeness that often comes along in teenagery speech. He does this in a smart way too, he doesn't dumb them down to only swear words. How the character speak is real but at the sometime smart and have specific voices. Augustus Waters and Hazel Grace are both wonderfully real characters that I wish were my friends. I just want to sit down and have a conversation with them. But then again the world is not a wish granting factory...<br /><br />Summery:<br />Hazel Grace Lancaster has thyroid cancer. A miracle drug has stalled the inevitable, she is going to die. She has slowly and deliberately withdrew from her world. She doesn't go to high school, spends her time watching horrible reality TV, taking college classes and hanging out with her best friends, Mom and Dad.  She does this to minimize the damage that her impeding doom will have on loved ones. Oh, she still has a few friends from her old life but she keeps them afar. This has been her life for about 3 years, her mother wants her to have a life. She makes Hazel go to a support group where she meets one Augustus Waters who turns her life inside out and upside down. He is also a cancer survivor who lost part of his leg to a bone cancer. Together they learn about love, loss, strength, pain, happiness and the universe.<br /><br />The part that makes this book so beautiful for me is the small details. Like that Hazel names her oxygen pump, Phillip and Augustus call her Hazel Grace. Or the way they talk to their parents. It is just beautiful and heartbreaking, a must read. John Green officially goes on my \\"Authors Who I Always Buy Their Books\\" list.

0345803485|1.0|I don't often write a bad review about a book. Usually I can find some redeeming quality, but sadly I cannot with these books. I started reading the first book and got to chapter 8 before realizing I'd read it before. I have been on the twilight fanfic sites for several years now. A lot of the stories use the names from twilight but they're human and not in character. Basically they just use the names so they can have an audience. It's a great way to start writing and get constructive criticism. There are some really awesome stories  that I wouldn't mind seeing in print.. this was not one of them. I prefer my stories to have a plot and character development. I read a lot of books (love my kindle) and all of the free kindle books I have gotten were better than this. This was a waste of money for me and a waste of time (after realizing I had read it several years ago, I skimmed through the other two just to make sure).<br /><br />So if you like to read, at the very least, a decent book, then don't buy this!!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I really liked this book, it was very entertaining.  I wish the that there was a sequel. I was very suprised by the way it ended.

B00782O7IY|3.0|\\"I won't talk. I won't say a word.\\" Silent movie star George Valentin (Dujardin) is the biggest star in Hollywood. While out getting his picture taken and talking to reporters he bumps into a young woman named Peppy Miller (Bejo). After seeing her picture in the paper she decided to audition for a role in a movie. She is an instant hit and her and George hit it off. When George's producer Al Zimmer (Goodman)tells him that the future is in \\"talkies\\" he laughs it off. He is stunned when it takes off, with Peppy as the star. I have seen all of the best picture nominees of the year and saved this one for last. I was very skeptical going in, how good can a black & white/silent movie really be in 2012? I will have to admit that the movie was better then I expected it to be, but I still think that this is one of the most overrated movies I have seen recently. If you have seen \\"Sunset Boulavard\\" then you have seen a much better version of this movie. I'm not saying that this is a bad movie and my problem with it wasn't that it was silent or black & white (I have no problem with those types of movies) but it was very boring in some parts and had trouble staying focused.  This movie could have been worse but I really don't think that this was deserving of best picture at all. Best actor I can see, but not picture. This is a movie to watch out of curiosity but don't expect the best movie of the year. Overall, the most overrated movie to win best picture since \\"Slumdog Millionare\\". I give it a B.<br /><br />**For those curious : I have seen all 9 best picture nominees and \\"Moneyball\\" was my favorite, but I think that \\"Descendants\\" should have won.
B005LAIIRQ|1.0|I don't know if my expectations were too high since I am not used to being disappointed by Liam Neeson movies or what, but this movie was TERRIBLE. I really do think that the 3-star average that it boasts is too much for this one.<br />Even Neeson's charisma cannot save this plot and dialogue.<br />If I had to describe it in 3 words, it would be: Tedious, Predictable, and Contrived!!!<br />I actually started fast forwarding the last 30 minutes just so I can get to the end and see if there would be a meaningful conclusion to this charade - Nope. Sorry!!! Just as idiotic as the rest of the movie.

0784011710|5.0|There is a strong contrast in this movie between aliveness and tragedy, between sunshine-happiness and darkness-unhappiness, between promise and failure.<br /><br />The story takes place in 1947, in New York, where Stingo, the clean-handed, yet-ignorant, life-loving young man comes to live in a boarding house; Sophie lives there also with her partner Nathan. Sophie is a Polish immigrant.<br />The movie portrays the meeting and unfolding relation between the inexperienced Stingo and this relatively experienced couple (Nathan and Sophie), a man and woman who are both having severe difficulty to cope with living their lives.<br />Though the character of Sophie, and her story, is what is probably most appealing in this movie, I think this movie can still be considered 'a coming of age movie', because Stingo's perspective remains central.<br /><br />This is definitely a great movie and one of my favourites. I was deeply impressed when I first saw it when I was 17.<br />If you want to see great acting, watch Meryl Streep and Kevin Kline here; what energy and intensity!  Also the cinematography is admirable.<br />I would say this movie is a significant artistic achievement.

B001GST11O|5.0|This concert is one of David Gilmour's last stops on the Remember That Night tour in support of his solo album. The audio quality/mix/post production are far superior to the Remember That Night Live at the Royal Albert Hall concert which was one of the first stops on the tour. Since David and the band had many more performances under their belts by the time they got to the Gdansk stop, the performances are the best of the tour. Sadly this is one of Richard Wright's last performances before he passed away which is another reason to treasure this DVD. My only complaint is that this concert is not offered in Blu-ray HD like the Royal Albert Hall concert although the original Gdansk concert was produced in HD. There is an HD version of the Gdansk concert I recorded on my DVR from the HD concert channel Paladia. However, with an up converting Blu-ray player the video quality is amazingly good. I highly recommend this DVD!

B0002O7Y8K|5.0|Director Roman Polanski illuminates Thomas Hardy's novel of the poor but spiritual and beautiful English country girl Tess, a role inhabited by a young and striking Natasia Kinski.  Those acquainted with Hardy's novels and biography are aware of his identification with a certain class of the 19th  century rural English poor--those of \\"the old families\\" that had (as his own family) descended from the Norman nobility that participated in the Norman Conquest.  The discovery by Tess' father that they were remnants of the once great and aristocratic Norman d'Urberville family sets Tess's life on what proves to be a tragic trajectory.  In her travels she associates herself with a wealthy family that she wrongly believes to be distant relations, only to find herself sexually harassed and pregnant by a young rake of that same clan.  Now a fallen woman, Tess finds that her way in the world is made painfully difficult--with even the seemingly wonderful and Christian man she eventually marries turning her away once he learns of her unfortunate past.
B005GFPZYK|5.0|Another great book by a Man who walked the walk, May God always Bless and Sustain you. This was another book that I could not put down. Well written and presented. I wish there was a way to get everyone to read the accounts of our Heroes throughout the decades and centuries. All Y'all who do not have a kindle get one, it is amazing how fast you can read a book and how easy it is on my 60's year old eyes.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|At first I didn't get the full purpose and all the functions. I just deleted it. Then I tried it again. Glad I did.
0345803485|1.0|I almost didn't buy this due to other reviews I have read...however...I listened to some friends who said it was a good book. Said friends who must not have experienced books with sex scenes before this one. Seriously...why is this book so popular? The maturity level and thought process of the protagonist is like listening to a 13 year old...I found myself rolling my eyes every time she said \\"I hugged myself\\" or \\"my inner goddess\\" which made it incredibly hard to read as I was rolling my eyes every paragraph. Also...what's appealing about a man who \\"drops his mouth\\" open over her juvenile attempts at being witty or sexy? He's doing a lot of mouth dropping and they're exchanging a lot of really boring emails. So there's a few spankings, some ice and baby bird feeding, and one scene with a whip. Come on. Go read some Susan Johnson, Nicole Jordan or old school Johanna Lindsey. You'll at least have characters who are somewhat interesting and still get your \\"kinky\\" in. And that's just romance. I have not delved into erotica literature, but I am sure you can find something with much more interesting characters and a much more mature writing style somewhere in that world.

B0064NTZJO|3.0|t seems to me that every single film that I have seen this year has Ryan Gosling starring in it.<br />Jokes aside, this is year of Ryan Gosling. Drive, has been directed by acclaimed Nicolas Winding Refn. Based on the 2005, James Sallis novel this is a moody film from the music, acting, story and the cinematography.<br />This sketch of a quiet driver ( Ryan Gosling) is acting lessons on wheels because the entire star cast is superb. The driver is a quiet man who does side job driving for con artists and also as a stunt man. He falls in love with the neighbor Irene ( Carey Mulligan) and her young son Benicio( Kaden Leos) Things start going awfully wrong when Irene's husband is released from prison.<br />Basically this is a very stylized version of the fable about the Scorpion and the Frog. In the story, the frog agrees to carry the scorpion across the river but stings the frog because it is the nature of the scorpion, thus drowning both. In the film, the Driver can be seen as the Frog( ironically, he also wears a scorpion jacket throughout the film, just as the frog carried the scorpion on the back) because he helps/drives scorpions around in his car but is inevitably dragged into their world and stung. Three stars. 4/30/2012
B006IGZWB2|5.0|Very much  enjoyed this movie, \\"The Help\\".  May more good movies be available.  Wow!  No immoral scenes!  yay!  Don't need those to make a good movie.  and humor is nice too.
B005MYEQ4U|3.0|Gil ( Owen Wilson) is a successful screenwriter who is constantly lamenting the fact that he is not a novelist and yearns to live in Paris. He is on vacation in this city with his fiancee ( Rachel Mcadams) and her parents. They bump into Inez' friend, Paul (Michael Sheen), a pompous know it all, pedantic. Gil to escape the company takes to strolling the streets of Paris at night and at midnight he is approached  and invited by a group of partiers in a vintage car. The film then goes into magical realism as he is soon bumping in to famous people of the 20's; such as Picasso, Hemingway, F. Scott Fitzgerald, Bunuel, Adrien Brody as Salvador Dali. Kathy Bates is Gertrude Stein .He also falls for Adriana ( Marion Cotillard), an art groupie who is pursued by both Picasso and Hemingway.<br />\\"Midnight in Paris\\" has one of the most beautiful scenes of Paris, and is a movie about following one's heart. To truly enjoy the film, you have to love Woody Allen and know the impact the fictional characters had on culture in America. Three stars. 4/30/2012

B007BLDFWG|3.0|Writer and director Sean Durkin crafts a film that is a glimpse into a tortured and destroyed psyche, it is a film about a crazy cult and the systematic brainwashing they undertake to keep their victims in it. Elizabeth Olsen, the sister of the famous twins Ashley and Mary-Kate Olsen, brings such an intensity that is both frightening and horrific at the same time. The title of the film is a series of names Olsen has. Her name is  Martha. She is given the name Marcy May by  a cult member when she joins the cult. And Marlene is the name used by all the women in the cult to answer the phone<br />The opening scenes show sister (Sarah Paulson) picking Martha (Elizabeth Olsen) as she tries to flee from the cult. The rest of the film deepens the mystery about her....The cult is run by John Hawkes ( Winter's bone) and he is chilling and cruel. Through the film which is in flashbacks and present day we learn about the cult, about women getting initiated and raped by him, orgies are okay and sometimes murders as well . Martha joins her sister and her husband, Ted (Hugh Dancy), at a summer house .But things are not normal as she fears that the cult is out to get her and she struggles with normalcy.<br />Durkins film is an eye opener about how cults operate and people getting sucked in to them. The initial initiation scene of her getting raped and then the new recruit being prepped by her for her master with a herbal cocktail of drugs are chilling. Elizabeth Olsen is excellent in every scene.<br />The end of the film is disturbing because the outcome is unknown. 4 stars. 4/29/2012
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I almost never write reviews for books as I am so busy and tend to rather use my free time enjoying one hobby or another but I felt this book in particular I needed to say something. From start to finish Wool Omnibus is an amazing journey through a rough apocalyptic world and yet far more believable then normally found in this genre. I find the characters engaging throughout and easy to slip their shoes on so to speak.<br /><br />The author does an excellent job of not overwhelming with detail. The book has no filler you try to speed through, every paragraph is important and relevant and that is a rare thing even among our most celebrated authors. I only hope if I do get time to finally write a few books myself that I can write as well. I will be buying this authors other books and I can easily recommend this to anyone who just enjoys a great story.
B003Y5H4Y8|3.0|After a botched attempt to kidnap a Nazi war criminal, the three Mossad agents who were on this mission try to return their lives to some degree of normalcy. Helen Mirren as Rachel Singer, and the two others are Stephan Gold ( Tom Wilkinson) and David Peretz. These agents start lying about the mission and the death of the war criminal Dieter Vogel ( Jesper Christensen). More than half of the film is played out in East Berlin as younf Rachel ( Jessica Castain), Stephan ( Martin Csokas) and David ( sam Worthington) plan the kidnap of Vogel.<br />This is an American remake of a Israeli film, and the action swings back and forth from the 60's to the 90's. As a minority, I found that the film was a little disappointing, the story line was slightly weak but exceptional performances from all the actors ultimately made the film watchable. Three stars. 4/15/2012
0393088774|4.0|Paul Krugman's purpose in writing this book is to:<br /><br />'...go over the heads of the Serious People who have, for whatever reason, taken all of us down the wrong path, at immense cost to our economies and our societies, and to appeal to informed public opinion in an effort to get us doing the right thing instead.' (Intro, Pxii).<br /><br />He starts out by analysing just what has gone wrong. Many, many writers have already done this, of course - [[ASIN:1846683092 David Harvey]], [[ASIN:0141045930 Nouriel Roubini]], [[ASIN:0745651119 Massimo Amato]] to name but a few - but Krugman's analysis is still really useful. He draws exact parallels between the Great Depression and the current so-called 'Great Recession', not only in terms of cause and effect but also in the variety of responses. His central thesis, however, is that:<br /><br />'...this doesn't have to be happening [italics in original]...the problem isn't with the economic engine, which is as powerful as ever. Instead, we're talking about what is basically a technical problem, a problem of organization and co-ordination.' (P22)<br /><br />We have reached a 'Minsky Moment' - as an economy expands, debtors and creditors are happy to borrow and lend until, suddenly, something pops. At that point, we all look down and discover that, like Wile E Coyote running off a cliff, there is nothing holding us up, and the whole edifice comes crashing down in a 'debt-deflation spiral' (P48) Debtors are desperately trying to pay off their debts (de-leveraging) while creditors are extremely wary of lending any more - even when interest rates are virtually zero, nothing is moving. This is the liquidity trap:<br /><br />'A liquidity trap happens when even at a zero interest rate the world's residents are collectively unwilling to buy as much stuff as they are willing to produce. Equivalently, the amount people want to save - that is, the income they don't want to spend on current consumption - is more than the amount businesses are willing to invest.' (P136)<br /><br />And the solution is simple - print more money:<br /><br />'The answer lies in depression economics, specifically in what I hope has become the familiar concept of the liquidity trap, in which even zero interest rates aren't  low enough to induce sufficient spending to restore full employment. When you're not in a liquidity trap, printing lots of money is indeed inflationary. But when you are in one, it isn't; in fact, the amount of money the Fed prints is very nearly irrelevant.' (P152)<br /><br />In fact, getting some inflation into the system would actually be beneficial. While deflation exacerbates the debt problem, inflation can do the opposite - and can price workers back into jobs as the real value of their wages is reduced in comparison to competitors.<br /><br />There is a real sense of exasperation running through the book - to Krugman, the Keynesian solutions are there, ready and waiting. We could get out of the current depression within the space of about two years if we simply learnt from the past. But his kind of 'salt water' economics (east and west coast universities) are not in fashion and haven't been for some thirty years. Instead, the current orthodoxy is taken from the 'fresh water' Chicago school and the 'Austerians'. The battle, then, is not simply between differing macroeconomic theories, but inevitably between political ideologies too. At this point, Krugman echoes [[ASIN:B004KAB618 Thomas Frank]] and [[ASIN:1847920926 Jeffrey Sachs]] in talking about the 'revolving door' between the regulators and those they are supposed to regulate. He sounds again like Thomas Frank ([[ASIN:1846556023 Pity the Billionaire]]) when he suggests that:<br /><br />'...saltwater - freshwater is about pragmatism versus quasi-religious certainty that has only grown stronger as the evidence has challenged the One True Faith.' (P104)<br /><br />This rather reminded me of Ronald Suskind's  'faith-based versus reality-based America'. Krugman is first and foremost a pragmatist.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Krugman turns his attention to Europe. Again, we see the insistence on 'austerity measures' really not benefitting either the economies or, more importantly, the people of Europe:<br /><br />'If you look at what Austerians want - fiscal policy that focuses on deficits rather than job creation, monetary policy that obsessively fights even the hint of inflation and raises interest rates even in the face of mass unemployment - all of it in effect serves the interests of creditors, of those who lend as opposed to those who borrow and/or work for a living. Lenders want governments to make honoring their debts the highest priority; and they oppose any action on the monetary side that either deprives bankers of returns by keeping rates low or erodes the value of claims through inflation.' (P207)<br /><br />And that is precisely what we are seeing in Greece, Spain, Ireland - countries Krugman refers to as 'GIPSI's (perhaps slightly more attractive than 'PIIGS'). Prioritising the repayment of debt over the welfare of the people of Europe will simply prolong the pain and do nothing at all to promote growth.<br /><br />This is a powerful and extremely timely book. Finally, we are hearing calls for growth over austerity from some quarters - but we are still, here in Europe, faced with both Swabian hausfraus and those that think that 'unemployment is a price worth paying.'<br /><br />At times, the writing style is a bit irritating - I don't really need to be advised to go watch [[ASIN:6304696582 Stagecoach]] to learn about bankers. But, quibbles aside, this book goes a long, long way in debunking the 'One True Faith' and provides an immediate way forward by learning from, and not simply forgetting or ignoring, the past.<br /><br />The  book is dedicated 'To the unemployed, who deserve better.'d America'. Krugman is first and foremost a pragmatist.<br /><br />Towards the end of the book, Krugman turns his attention to Europe. Again, we see the insistence on 'austerity measures' really not benefitting either the economies or, more importantly, the people of Europe:<br /><br />'If you look at what Austerians want - fiscal policy that focuses on deficits rather than job creation, monetary policy that obsessively fights even the hint of inflation and raises interest rates even in the face of mass unemployment - all of it in effect serves the interests of creditors, of those who lend as opposed to those who borrow and/or work for a living. Lenders want governments to make honoring their debts the highest priority; and they oppose any action on the monetary side that either deprives bankers of returns by keeping rates low or erodes the value of claims through inflation.' (P207)<br /><br />And that is precisely what we are seeing in Greece, Spain, Ireland - countries Krugman refers to as 'GIPSI's (perhaps slightly more attractive than 'PIIGS'). Prioritising the repayment of debt over the welfare of the people of Europe will simply prolong the pain and do nothing at all to promote growth.<br /><br />This is a powerful and extremely timely book. Finally, we are hearing calls for growth over austerity from some quarters - but we are still, here in Europe, faced with both Swabian hausfraus and those that think that 'unemployment is a price worth paying.'<br /><br />At times, the writing style is a bit irritating - I don't really need to be advised to go watch [[ASIN:6304696582 Stagecoach]] to learn about bankers. But, quibbles aside, this book goes a long, long way in debunking the 'One True Faith' and provides an immediate way forward by learning from, and not simply forgetting or ignoring, the past.<br /><br />The  book is dedicated 'To the unemployed, who deserve better.'
B005FITIGO|4.0|Margin call can come closest to depict the action in the offices of Lehman Brothers or Bear Stearns in 2008 before the impending doomsday of the great financial crisis. This movie is set in the year 2008 when the scenario of doom becomes clear as a ousted employee ( Stanley Tucci) exits with the words ` Be careful\\" to his junior Zachary Quinto. The rest of the movie is trying to figure out the the financials and how to come out of the crisis. All the CEOS then gather for an all night marathon trying to figure an exit plan. The chief boss is Tuld, whose name coincidentally rhymes with Richard Fuld, the clueless and useless CEO of Lehman Bros. Here however, Tuld is a warrior and he asks for information in plain english, `' speak to me as if you were speaking to a child, or a golden retriever. He allays everyone fears and finds a way to save the firm and even make money from the crisis, a solution doomed to screw the lives of many people.The casting is superb and everyone acts well...Jeremy Irons, Kevin Spacey, Although this is labelled as a thriller, I feel a strong background in Economics, Stock markets would make the film very watchable. If you do then I recommend the ` Inside Job\\" before watching this film.<br />This is not a film which can be perceived as an attack on Wall Street but rather an objective look at the decisions made by people in power to save their own skin.<br />Margin Call manages to capture the world of finance and power brokers who are busy at work seemingly clueless to the millions of ordinary American, clueless to their state yet aware of the perilous power that they have- there is a scene in which Paul Bettany tries to justify the crisis.<br />New York City at late night, when nearly three fourth of America is asleep looks gorgeous and sad in the eyes of these power brokers.<br />A eye opening film about the financial crisis and the repercussions it had. Four stars.
B007L3BMGA|5.0|From the first pages to the last i couldn't put this book down. The characters are well written and it completely sucks you into this world of Christian Grey and Anastasia Steele.<br /><br /> Christian Grey is a self made billionaire with a dark side, a side that's hidden from everyone, even his family. He agrees to do an interview with a university paper and sets off a string of events that even he doesn't know will change his life. Christian likes to be in control all the time, in business and pleasure, and not much throws him until he meets someone in an unusual way.<br /><br /> Anastasia Steele is a student who's best friend and room mate is the editor for the university paper,she's quiet, shy and attractive. When her friend comes down with the flu before an important interview Anastasia is roped into doing the interview on very short notice. With questions in one hand and 2 left feet she stumbles into her future. After graduation she has plans what she wants to do, move to Seattle and find a job. Little does she know that her life is going to be not quite so simple.<br /><br /> I did find that her \\"inner thoughts\\" could get annoying but overall I'm now addicted. I've read all 3 books in a week. It is quite graphic in the way their activities are played out but overall you see the love story that every woman wishes she had.
B007IQX1G4|4.0|Jason Reitman specialises in the characters who are cool but soulless, and at the end suffer a lot. Up in the Air and Thank you for smoking are fine examples of such characters. Reitman teams up again with Diablo Cody to create Mavis Gary ( Charlize Theron) who has never matured beyond the high school prom queen days. At 37. she is divorced, an alcoholic, a ghost writer for adult fiction series Waverly Prep, which is soon to be cancelled. Still Mavis thinks she has got it all and return to Mercury, Wisconsin to bring back her ex flame Buddy ( Patrick Wilson), who is now happily married and a father. After some awkward moments, the final embarrassment for Mavis come at the baby naming party. This film makes you feel bad and does offer hope, halfhearted at best at the end. Charlize Theron takes on her role to a new level and it is nice to see in form after Monster. What works in the film is the capturing of small town America and its people who seem to idolize Mavis because they think she has made it and the unexpected friendship that develops between Mavis and Matt ( Patton Oswalt), a former schoolmate and the victim of a hate crime. The film is lacking somehow in the writing department but has the mood and the story to make it watchable. 4 stars 4/25/2012

B007AMMHSY|5.0|Pedro Almodovar prolific filmmaking has been inconsistent lately, Volver, Talk to her and Broken embraces may have received accolades but the benchmark for him will be this film. Such is the impact this film has on the viewers. La piel que habito is the title of the original spanish film adapted from a book by Thierry Jonquet's Tarantula (original French title: Mygale) by Pedro Almod&oacute;var. Weird but truly disturbing are the words that come to my mind immediately but that said this is a enjoyable film and a must see.<br /><br />It is about Robert Ledgard, a brilliant world class plastic surgeon, who failed to save his wife after a car crash that left almost 90 percent of her body and face scarred forever. He becomes single minded in his pursuit to make the perfect skin that will be resistant to fire. In a important part of the story this film is also about Vera ( Elena Anaya) and how she became his experiment.<br /><br />Although the pace is sometimes slow nevertheless the film is based on many complex layers. Among the most prominent are control, justice, a fathers love for his daughter and a husbands mad obsession. The central plot will have you cringing at the end, believe me- you may think you know the film but this is unlike you have ever seen.<br />Anthony Banderas is in top form and once again shows what a great actor he truly is. Elena Anaya is wonderful as the hapless victim who finds her life changed forever by Ledgard. Jan Cornet's Vicente will probably evoke the most sympathy as an night of overindulgence fulled mistake sets of a chain of unfortunate events altering his life for the worse.<br />This is not a easy film as sex, forced sexuality and rape are frequent- those with underage children please beware. One of the best films I have seen this year. 5 stars. 4/19/2012

B004CYKZZA|4.0|I really like this headset, it's better than what I was honestly expecting given the price point.<br /><br />Good points:<br /><br />Decent audio output quality, way better than expected.<br />Decent Range.<br />Decent battery life and can charge while using.<br /><br />Bad points:<br />Feels flimsy, I always handle it with kid gloves because I'm certain it will break the moment I don't.<br />Sync button already slightly broken after a few weeks, it works but doesn't press in like a button and I have to mash it a bit.<br />Mic input quality is a bit bad, lower quality than the output by a ton.<br /><br />Final thoughts:<br />I doubt I'll have this for a long time as I'm certain it will break within 6-12 months, but for the price point if you really need a wireless headset to get you through, I would say this would be worth slightly more than what I paid. It's a better option than going to a department store and buying a cheap headset, of this I'm sure.

B007CBEO20|5.0|Europe had always shown promise. Their earliest releases showed a flair for hard rocking melodic tunes. And as they became popular, they had experimented with a harder, bluesier sound at times during the 1991 album \\"Prisoners In Paradise,\\" particularly on the great b side \\"Government Man.\\" They stripped their sound down and tried some acoustic stuff also. But it was not until after their breakup and reformation in 2004 for the album \\"Start From the Dark\\" that the band really, truly found their creative groove. That album had its moments, but it was more about the groove, as it lacked cohesive hooks. The follow up to that (2006's \\"Secret Society\\") was a blistering, gutsy rock album that pulled out all the stops, and the follow up to that (2009's \\"Last Look At Eden\\") found the band combining a bluesy guitar driven sound with the hooks of their earlier work.<br /><br />So now, \\"Bag of Bones\\" is released and it is a further improvement. Joey Tempest has never sounded better vocally or lyrically. These songs have hooks and hit hard. \\"Doghouse\\" is one of the band's greatest songs. The album opener \\"Riches To Rags\\" is another standout. The album's lone ballad, the closing track \\"Bring It All Home,\\" is a maudlin ballad that is not sappy or cheesy in any way. It is a surprisingly emotional and sentimental look back at life through the years. As for the performances of the band, they are playing these songs with an energy that is palpable, and a level of enthusiasm that bands much younger than them can rarely even reach.<br /><br />Europe has now been around for three full decades. This is without question the best album a band has ever released this late into their careers. And given the quality of this recording, there is no reason to think that this band has any intention of slowing down. It's one thing to get better with age. It's another thing to get so much better that age becomes irrelevant. If Europe keeps releasing albums as good as \\"Bag Of Bones,\\" they could go on for another 30 years. This is the type of album that will singlehandedly renew your faith in sensible melodic rock.or another 30 years. This is the type of album that will singlehandedly renew your faith in sensible melodic rock.

0345803485|1.0|This poorly written porno novel went straight to the recycle bin.  How this became a best seller is a sad commentary on society today.
B007URCTOG|3.0|It was a good movie, not bad because the actors are not bad.<br /><br />The only thing that is enraging and makes you angry is the way the story went. Both my husband and I were sooo upset at how Paige ended acting in the story. In the end it ends okay but it's still like...\\"argh are you kidding me?!\\". Very surprised it's based on true events....<br /><br />Good to watch, wont buy on dvd for sure, but dont regret renting it either.

B0073PZIYI|2.0|The premise for this movie is intriguing, time and money are one and the same, putting value on a person's most limited resource.<br /><br />Honestly, if you knew exactly home much time left on this earth, would you waste it or make the most of it? That shouldn't be too difficult a question to answer.<br /><br />If you had all the time in the world, would you tire of it?  That's the rub.<br /><br />The movie really doesn't deliver on the premise.  It takes the tried and not so true path of us against them, rich vs. poor.  The story limits the actors, boxing them into simplistic characters.<br /><br />Throw in a bit of just okay action sequences and you end up with a two star movie.<br /><br />It really is too bad someone dropped the ball on the concept behind this film.
0393088774|1.0|Krugman's central claim is that we have austerity in this country. Look up the numbers. Using 2008 as a baseline which had big deficits anyways, federal spending has seen an extra $500 billion every year. State and local spending is up $100 billion each since 2008, every year. Feel free to wade through usgovernmentspending.com.<br /><br />How is spending close a trillion extra dollars austerity per year?
B0073LWEXK|5.0|Evoking memories of classic text based adventures (only with pictures this time!) The Lost City made for a very enjoyable play.  The clues are subtle enough that you won't just fly through in one sitting, but not so frustrating that you lose interest.  Bottom line is that the game is well balanced and can be completed without resorting to the built-in spoiler hints.<br /><br />The gameplay itself consists of navigating your way through a forest setting in distinct frame-based fashion. An auto-mapping function aids in finding your way around as you search for clues and items on your way to your goal.<br /><br />I nearly rated this one 4-stars, but went with 5 when I saw that the regular price had been dropped to only 99 cents.  There is definitely 99 cents worth of gameplay here, but not quite $1.99 which was the original price.

Now to watch in 1080p full high definition just brings back so many childhood memories. I would just like to say thank you to all of the looney tunes and Michael Jordan for being in this movie it is one of my favorite looney tunes movies ever. I only wish that the looney tunes back in action movie was in full high definition that would be great to add to my collection of DVDs' and Blu-Rays'.
0985114606|1.0|I have never in my life found two books that read almost exactly the same. Bare to You is as close to Fifty Shades of Grey as a book can get and not be called Fifty Shades of Grey. While I loved the FSoG series, the fact that I actually finished this book is a miracle. I was intrigued to see just how ridiculous it would get and, sadly, I was not disappointed.<br /><br />**Spoilers**<br /><br />Christian = Gideon<br />Ana = Eva<br />Ehlena/Christian = Magdelene/Corinne/Gideon (altho there was no Mrs. Robinson)<br />Jose = Cary - close friends of Ana/Eva (both photograph pictures of Ana/Eva)<br />Taylor = Angus - Christian's/Gideon's chauffeurs with accents<br />Dr. Flynn = Dr. Peterson - therapists<br /><br />Christian/Gideon similarities:<br />Both are extraordinarily hot, handsome, sexy and fit (not a problem)<br />Upon meeting Ana/Eva for the first time, they were instantly smitten when they witness Ana/Eva trip/stumble in their office/office building<br />Are in their late twenties (billionaires, owning numerous companies)<br />Live in opulent high-rises with spectacular views<br />Have one brother and one sister<br />Chose brunettes exclusively for sexual partners<br />Use business transaction approach to have sexual relationship with Ana/Eva<br />Became obsessively addicted and possessive to Ana/Eva - \\"you are mine\\" \\"only mine\\"<br />Both stated up front they didn't do romance, but guess what?<br />Have severe mood swings leaving Ana/Eva second-guessing all the time<br />Either owned Ana's/Eva's employer's company or the employer's building<br />Suffered trauma at a very young age<br />Support charities for the abused<br />Have large scale, wall mounted photographs of Ana/Eva<br />Conducted extensive investigations into Ana's/Eva's background<br />Both say to Ana/Eva \\"do you know what you do to me?\\"<br />Have nightmares screaming out about being touched/hurt then awaken with a need to have sex immediately. In addition to Gideon's trauma suffered at the age of five when his father committed suicide, there is apparently some other sexual abuse that has him going mental, but you do not learn what that is in this book.<br /><br />And now for Ana/Eva similarities:<br />Both are beautiful women in their early twenties, but don't see it in themselves<br />Had similar \\"first\\" jobs right out of college - publishing company/ad agency<br />Mothers both married three times<br />Love their dads who have carried a torch for their remarried mother<br />Have deep-rooted insecurities. Question what Christian/Gideon see in them when they could have their pick of any woman they want.<br /><br />Train wreck meets roller coaster! I felt like I got whiplash with (IMO) one horribly written scene followed by another.<br /><br />Eva, who was sexually abused by a stepbrother at the age of 10 dreams she is being sexually attacked again only to awaken and find that Gideon, while he is also dreaming, is, in fact, trying to rape her. Were they having the same dream? Gideon abhorred by what he has done wants to leave but is convinced to stay. She then tells him she loves him. Really? Seriously? And then, just like that, he wants to have sex? Again, really? She tells him she can't, that how she's just woken up is too fresh in her mind...then two hours later, they are having sex. \\"Let's forget\\" she tells him. Really? Oh, and how are they going to insure the attack doesn't repeat itself...Gideon got a prescription.<br /><br />Fast forward to gala dinner where Gideon and Eva run into Magdalene and...Corinne. It turns out Corinne and Gideon were once engaged to me married. This is shocking news, of course, but shouldn't be since Cary and Eva set up Google alerts for Gideon and dredged up every newsworthy article and photo they could find about him. What, no news about Gideon getting engaged? Then Magdalene and Eva commiserate over their love for Gideon. (This is laughable!) Gideon actually leaves the three women alone and Corinne coos that she has heard so much about Eva from Gideon as they talk nearly every single day. And then admits that she still loves him - \\"you can't blame me for that.\\" Gideon/Eva ending up fighting ah-gain, run out to limo, where Eva caves, they have rough sex, go back to party where Gideon gives all his attention to Corinne, not speaking to or looking at Eva. Only when she takes up conversation with a man sitting next to her, does Gideon notice and tells the guy to back off. Ah-gain another scene where Eva leaves and heads home. Ah-gain Gideon follows and they have another fight. She accuses him of ignoring her and he responds \\"it's impossible for me to ignore you Eva. If you're in the same room with me, I don't see anyone else.\\" But he was definitely ignoring her. Then he proceeds to tell her that the reason he's never told her he loved her is because [love] is nothing compared to what he feels for her. (Again laughable). Eva caves again and they have sex again. She asks him to stop seeing Corinne and he tells her he can't because she's having a bit of trouble right now. Sound familiar? Mrs. Robinson was being blackmailed and Christian couldn't abandon her either. Never a dull moment!<br /><br />No need for me to read the next book in this series \\"Deeper in You\\" because I have already read Fifty Shades Darker.
B000KXZ8YU|2.0|A few years ago I read On the Road and was surprised to find that I largely hated it.  Kerouac ably described the travelling spirit, but there seemed little else to recommend: Depth was low while self-indulgence reigned high, the best friend that Jack idolized seemed to me a complete tool, and the writing style itself was dullingly plain and hideously unexpurgated.  Even before I learned about the legendary \\"scroll\\" that Jack created so that he wouldn't be slowed down by anything so brief as changing a sheet of paper, it had become apparent to me that the novel was composed with an approach to words that eschewed any premeditation or craft.  I found I couldn't agree more with Truman Capote's famous dismissal of \\"That's not writing, that's typing.\\"<br /><br />But I was determined to give Kerouac another chance, and I'm pleased to say that The Dharma Bums is a significant improvement; impressively, Jack actually appears to have made an effort at writing this time out!  His fondness for run-on sentences and a disregard for punctuation can still annoy, and his portmanteau words or jury-rigged phrases may not always succeed, but the very fact that he's even attempting them here makes the reading experience a far more tolerable one.<br /><br />Just as importantly, the characters' interest in Zen Buddhism, and their persistent attempts to find meaning in life (even in their stated refusal of definitions and meanings) gives the thrust of the novel a more weighted tone than the empty self-indulgence seen in On the Road; true, there's an enduring sense of pretentiousness as we watch these two middle-class white dudes debate the nature of their philosophies, but even that's somewhat redeemed by a moment when the main character realizes that himself.  It's a rare moment of perspective, but it does occur.<br /><br />That said, the novel still dragged on and on and on, and could have been far more enjoyable as a novella half its length.  While I'm glad to see that Kerouac was able to grow as a writer after On the Road, I don't think I'll ever have a need to again sample his writings after this.e to grow as a writer after On the Road, I don't think I'll ever have a need to again sample his writings after this.
0525478817|5.0|There's so many other beautifully written reviews on this book, that mine will probably seem repetitive and go unnoticed. However, I have to write my thoughts on it anyway.<br /><br />When I finished reading TFIOS, I went out into the living room to tell my mom about the story. Excluding the spoilers, this is pretty much what I told her:<br /><br />I really enjoyed John Green's honesty in this book. He didn't over romanticize the relationship between Augustus and Hazel, and didn't over dramatize the cancer situation. From what I could see, he tried to keep the situations as close to real as possible. And what I mean by that, is that if it were a real situation between two very real people, the thoughts, and feelings of said people would probably be similar to these characters. Happy moments were happy, sad moments were sad, awkward moments were awkward, and angry moments were filled with anger. It was an emotional read, but a very good read at that.
0525478817|5.0|This book literally blew me away. I started to read it and would not put it down. I read it consistently for 54 hours straight and was done. I cried, I laughed, I smiled, and for the past couple weeks John Green has become one of my all-time favorite authors. The thought process of The Fault in Our Stars is phenomenal and extraordinary. I cannot think of another book with as honest of writing that this book has (except other John Green books) and the worlds of Hazel and Augustus changed my view-point of life and gripped my heart. They will never leave my memory, nor will John Green or this book. I am truly grateful for all its given me.

B003TJ4YU6|5.0|During the first two shows, it seems Ringo is not feeling well but that could just be Ringo.  I remember watching the first night with my grandmother and enjoyed the reaction to the girls in the audience as much as the Beatles themselves.  This was Rock history without any doubt and if some think the video and audio were not first rate, remember these TV shows were not equipped with DOLBY and any advanced systems studios today have.  This double set is truly historical and it is a gas watching the Beatles enjoy themselves doing their first live US perormances on television.  Great discs, great entertainment.
0345803507|5.0|There are a lot of negative reviews on these books, but to them I say, HAVE SOME FUN ALREADY! No, it's certainly not the best book ever written, but the underlying meaning is that people meet, and fall in love and learn to compromise with each other.  Look past the almost annoyingly repetitive sex, and look at two young people who are madly in love with each other and will do anything for one another.  I thought the books were great, to the point where I read each twice and contemplating reading again.  My husband loves my revised interest in lust for him, and we are recommending the book to all of our friends.  It was like a passion candle in my brain that has been relit and is making me feel sexy and carefree again. That's the most I've EVER gotten out of a book. Love it! Can't wait for more!
B0018BB21G|5.0|i know a lot of folks will think other wise, i is my opinion the the first 7 albums are their best work. from days of future passed to the live album, a string of albums that has a little of everything music, spoken word<br />and great driving rock and roll,guitars drum, ect this album is no diffferent. each album takes you on a journey.0
B005LAIGPA|5.0|We didn't have very high expectations for this, but it turned out to be surprisingly fascinating. It had depth along with some high octane excitement.<br /><br />Three high school boys get exposed to something that changes them physically, and they develop superhuman powers. It was a scifi, but it was more. It was also a story that went deep into what might happen to people if they were suddenly given god-like power over others and over natural laws like gravity. The movie chronicles what happens to the three boys who have vastly different personalities and lives.<br /><br />I don't want to give too much away by telling more of the story than I have, but it was really well done. The acting was excellent, the script really good, the special effects fantastic. I was entertained throughout.<br /><br />The only negatives were that the shaky camera style was a bit difficult to watch at times, and the story seemed to move slowly in the beginning of the movie. However that beginning was needed so we would get to know the characters and their situations well.<br /><br />Parents should know that there's some intense violence.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this movie to scifi fans, action flick fans, and anyone who wants to see a good character study. And perhaps this movie explains a bit why God didn't give humans unlimited power!

This story is heartbreaking, funny, sexy, and oh so compelling! I immediately bought book 2!
B004R13U6Y|5.0|I love the fact it remembers position, annotate pdfs text, shapes, and numerous other annotations. it makes the text lot sharper on scanned pdfs. worth the money for features it provides.  got free from amz daily deals
B007V2UGPE|5.0|This game can be tricky at times and you may have to restart it every once in a while, but don't give up its worth it.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I loved it and the first sight of the graphiced quality gave me a little hope for a good game. I haven't had a cancer to play a game this epic in weeks. I praise this game and their creators
B005J4TLN4|4.0|This move was actually very surprising, I did not think it was going to be as enjoyable as it actually was.  After having seen the preview, I was skeptical at best...it seemed kinda cheesy.  How ever, I like sci-fi & all that, and I like Nick Frost, so I finally decided I would give it a watch and see what I thought.  By the end of it, I was actually fairly entertained.  It wasn't what I would call the absolute best movie I've ever seen, but it was definitely better than average I thought, and it by no means sucked.  It was a fun new sci-fi horror comedy that was rather unique.  Nick Frost didn't play the biggest role in it, but for the parts he was in it, he was pretty good...his usual goofy funny self.  The stuff he does with Simon Pegg (i.e. Shaun of the Dead, Hot Fuzz, Paul, Adventures of Tin Tin, etc) will always be my favorite though, of either actor, though they have been good in everything else I've seen each of them in.  I was not real familiar with the other actors in this movie, but they all did a really good job I thought, even the 2 kids.  If you're into sci-fi, horror, and comedy and language & gore doesn't phase you, then I highly recommend checking out this one...it's actually quite entertaining.  I for one will probably be scooping this up at some point to add to my collection.
B000PMLFRA|3.0|[[ASIN:B000PMLFRA Star Wars: The Original Trilogy (Episodes IV - VI) [Blu-ray]]]  The following is a brief review of the current Blu Ray release of Star Wars: A New Hope, from the \\"Original\\" Trilogy.  For starters, this is not the original trilogy, but the enhanced version with extra scenes and CGI that were added in the 1990's.  The actual original theatrical releases of the trilogy, as seen in 1977, 1980 and 1983 are not present in this Blu Ray edition.  This review is only for Star Wars, as I have not viewed The Empire Strikes Back or Return of the Jedi.<br /><br />Here are my observations:<br />- Picture clarity: phenomenal!  In terms of sharpness, Star Wars has never looked so good!<br /><br />- Color saturation: overdone, pure and simple.  I love rich, vivid color and there certainly is no shortage of it here, but it's to such a degree that bright primary colors often \\"bleed\\" too much, especially where special effects are concerned.  Skin tones are off quite a bit (too many pink faces).  This release requires some adjustment to your TV's settings to get the right balance, whereas most Blu Rays I've seen are just fine right out of the box.<br /><br />- Contrasts: exceptionally sharp.  But as with the color in many instances, too sharp, especially in the outdoor desert scenes.  It almost adds a cartoonish effect.  It looks unnatural.  Indoor scenes, however, are fantastic except, again, for the over-enhanced special effects (lasers, stun rays, electrical currents, holographic images).<br /><br />- Artifacting: mostly around CGI images but it is minimal; not quite as distracting as the old-fashioned effects as they were originally presented over 30 years ago.<br /><br />- Sound effects: some substitutions that were not in the original release or, strangely enough, in the enhanced re-release; in other words, something purely on Blu Ray; most notable is Obi-Wan's call that frightens away the Sand People: it sounds less like a strange approaching beast of some sortand more like a man who's falling off of one of Tatooine's cliffs;  pretty ridiculous, really and, as stated in regards to color and contrast, overdone.<br /><br />- Sound: horrid.  Yes, it's loud, crisp and free of distortion, but it also sounds like it was recorded in a tin can.  It almost sounds like a mono soundtrack.  I had to take a second look at the packaging to make sure I hadn't been ripped off with a pirated copy.<br /><br />Overall Blu Ray impression: Star Wars: A New Hope has never looked clearer or more colorful.  But the last DVD releases, though not visually as stunning, are still far superior in terms of contrasts, balance and sound.  I almost feel cheated, really.  But man, is that picture ever sharp!  Almost too much detail, really.  Buy this release if you must, but be prepared to play with monitor (TV) settings and just live with the sound.  Personally, I cannot wait to see if this receives a second release on Blu Ray with the true original theatrical release, with improved sound quality and better balance of color.<br /><br />I cannot in good conscience rate the Blu Ray any higher than 3 stars, though Star Wars (the story) is and always will be 5 star entertainment.
B000ZZWGMK|5.0|I thought to myself I can't read this boring book just by looking at the cover...I can honestly say shame on me because this book was great :-)!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|lots of fun. wide variety of games. you'll never get bored. always something unique.  I totally reccomend it. great job.
0345803485|5.0|This has been by far the most remarkable book I have came in contact with. I read this book in three days, and I couldn't put this book down. Fifty Shade of Grey by El James is a must READ...she also has two other books connecting to this story. I just ordered the last two I'm really excited. If anyone is looking for this book in the library you guys may have a hard time. This book was taken off the shelves due to the HARD CORE writing but overall it's great :-)!!!!! Individuals are constantly  bashing the author if steaming sexual thoughts bore you, or you feel it's not to society's liking (put it down nobody is forcing you to read it) I loved this book very detailed....
1591795230|5.0|Excellent content author very pleasant narrator I would be very interest in keeping up with the evolvement of this work.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is so much fun and by the way really awesome<br />this game is fun for me and I'm older
B006MVJ2L4|5.0|I personally loved this album and considered it a gigantic step ahead compared to Adam's first album. And criticizing him for not following the rock path cannot be taken seriously. Adam Lambert is a singer he wants to be, he chooses his musical style himself without blind following other people advice. He wanted to make a pop album - and he made by far the best pop album of 2012, hands down. To listen people dominating  current pop charts after Adam Lambert is the same thing as listen to musical degree student compositions after Chopin.<br /><br />\\"Trespassing\\" is a pure jam, MUST LISTEN AND MUST HAVE.
B005K17RU0|4.0|I really like this weather app &amp; haven't had any problems with it on my fire.  much better than on my aneroid phone.

B007SGM084|5.0|Fun, excitement, adventure, sex--what more could we ask for in entertainment?  The dominant/submissive part is nothing more than role play and no different than the Jacob/Edward in the Twilight Series.  A very powerful, rich man who can make anything happen and loves the girl so completely that he is obsessed and nothing but her safety matters to him.  Who doesn't want to be loved in that way which is impossible in real life.  As I read he makes me feel beautiful and special and worthy of his attentions.  Then there is the place where I can help to heal him, satisying my need to nurture.  The book is brilliant.
B007NESBK2|5.0|In keeping with the consistent theme expressed by those privileged enough to see it, the Sade tour of 2011 was one of the best put-together tour performances you could have seen.<br /><br />To give some background to it, I went to see the performance they did in Philadelphia, PA. Which was the second city of the first week of the tour. I initially bought the tickets in the fall of 2010. For a concert date taking place at the end of June 2011. A Sade new CD release and/or concert tour (as fans would know) has become a rare event. Taking place about once every 10 years or so now. Who knows when (or if) there will be another opportunity. So, I wasn't going to miss it. But, I remember thinking, at the time, why were they selling tickets so early to an event taking place 9 months in the future. I, personally, had never bought tickets to an event so far in advance before. But, when I saw the finished production, I KNEW why. It was the preparation and planning involved. As compared to other shows, even the last Sade tour in 2001, it wasn't just a singing and playing performance. There was actually some creative thought put into the visual, as well. There were specific theme, costume and stage set-ups, according to each song. Of which, there was plenty of them included to satisfy any fan's preferences.<br /><br />By the way, I consistently say THEY because Sade is more than just a singer being backed up by some replaceable musicians. It is a GROUP. In more ways than one, I have discovered. Four core members (Sade Adu-lead singer, Stuart Matthewman-guitar/saxophone, Paul Spencer Denman-bass, Andrew Hale-keyboards) composing, playing and performing together since BEFORE their first album release in 1984. All performances and record sales divided equally amongst the members. With almost every song in their repertoire, written by a member or members in the group. As those who saw one of their performances can attest to, Matthewman was almost as popular as Sade, herself. Who hasdone a remarkable job over the years as lead singer especially considering that, according to her, it wasn't her intention to become a singer at all, in the beginning.<br /><br />But, Sade has always been at the very top of my musical favorites. One of the few artists that I, literally, listen to every single song of their, now, 6 original recorded releases without skipping a single song or track. Ever since seeing a performance during one of their 2011 tour dates, I have visual images when I listen to a particular song I saw performed live that night. Now, with the documented video release of one of these concert performances, I won't have to rely on memory anymore.
B0073LWEXK|5.0|absolutely enchanting game. very reminiscent of myst. my only complaint is that I wish it had been longer. highly recommend!

She goes to the reaping and Prim, her little sister gets called to be a tribute.

The amazing suanne collins is the most terrific writer of this generation. We love you suzanne!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0079R8IYW|4.0|For the most part this product meets expectations and the few minor complaints I have with it are not something that would deter me from purchasing it.<br /><br />The case is very sturdy and heavy enough to feel it's protecting your Kindle without being too cumbersome.<br />The fit is perfect with no wiggle room. It fits in easily and snuggly without putting up a struggle.<br /><br />The little wallet pockets on the inside flap are nice however fitting more than a couple of cards becomes problematic as the more you try to get in, the tighter the space becomes.<br /><br />The magnetic close feels a little too weak to me. Especially if you keep any cards in the flap. The \\"kick-stand\\" fold is a nice feature but rather limited to the one angle and its reverse position. The \\"frame\\" surrounding the screen portion of your Kindle sometimes is a little too close to the action and makes hitting the home icon difficult without a little smushing. Any of the buttons you would use which are located at the extreme edges of the device become a little \\"iffy\\" when inside this case. It's not that hard to smush past the frame but it is a bit of a design flaw which is my biggest gripe.<br /><br />It's not perfect but it does offer a very good looking sturdy protection to your device which almost makes up for the design tweaks.
B000JQUMPI|3.0|Little women is a ok book. It's a nice family book but could use more drama. It's good for little girls but be sure to know it doesn't relate to are modern world.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like this game.It is one of the best games I have ever had.It works reaaly good with Kindle Fires'.When I start playing it is hard to stop.That is why I give it five stars.It is also very easy.I highly recommend it.
B007EC27QM|4.0|Fantastic app! I use it for all my calculations. The only thing that would make it better would be an option for notes so I don't have to write everything down on paper when I'm done calculating.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|get it now! !!!!!!! some games are hard but its so fun to have with u &lt;3 :) &lt;3 :) ;)
B0054JZC6E|5.0|its not a bad game. all of my friends like to play this game when I let them use my kindle.
0439023521|4.0|I enjoyed this book.  It was engaging, but I have to say I was somewhat disappointed after all the hype.  It is pretty light weight even though the subject matter is not.  The main thing that I did not like was that the easy way was always taken.  Our heroine did not have to make any really hard decisions because the author made sure that didn't happen.  And I knew ahead of time what would happen to each character because of that.  That really took away from what could have been a really great book. So if you want a light weight read to  spend an afternoon on and you don't mind that it is all prettily wrapped up for you, then this is for you.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved, loved, loved the trilogy. All those saying is a bad thing or close to sexual abuse towards a woman obviously do not remember all the things they might have done with their partners out of love. I know in got some great ideas from this book to spice up things with my hubby!!!!
B007V2UGPE|5.0|I love this app cause you can upgrade everything like soldiers and powers ans your samurai. I love to use the special charms.
B0053O89IS|5.0|Season seven: Aired November 3, 2011 - May 14, 2012.<br />This season it was only 13 episodes due to Emily Deschanel pregnancy. Fox has ordered an additional four episodes that will either be included with this season, or be a mini-summer season. Guess we have to wait and see.<br /><br />Let me start by saying I have watched every season of \\"Bones\\", and have been an avid fan since episode one, so when I heard there would only be 13 episodes this season I was a little bit skeptical. After watching this season I can honestly say even with -basically half a season I was not disappointed. During season seven we have a lot happening in such a short period of time. We have a new arrival to the team, a new serial killer...more drama, comedy, and of course more murder mysteries. This season was one of the best; the last couple of episodes were so hard to watch.<br /><br />Any more details will spoil the season, so if you are a fan of the previous seasons, then invest in season seven. \\"Bones\\" continues to be one of the best Drama/crime shows on television today.
0345803493|3.0|\\"You are a pervert.\\"<br />\\"I know.\\"  He raises his eyebrows and his grin broadens.<br />\\"My pervert,\\" I whisper.<br />\\"Yes, yours.\\"<br /><br />This is actual dialogue between Ana and Christian, the narrator and her billionaire boyfriend.  These books have conflicted me.  The dialogue, plot contrivances, and most of the characters are completely ridiculous.  And yet, for reasons I don't fully understand, I am on book three of the trilogy.  I guess I want to see what happens with these characters, even though every page makes me cringe and/or laugh.  Starting with Christian, the billionaire...who is also incredibly hot...with an insatiable sexual appetite...and he pilots his own helicopter...and he's a philanthropist...and a concert-level pianist...and an expert dancer...and of course, he's completely head over heels in love with Ana.  I am fully expecting that he will find a cure for cancer by the end of the third book.<br /><br />Fifty Shades Darker introduces a new character who is a sexually harassing villain.  He serves no other purpose in this book than to attempt to abuse Ana.  We all know sexual harassment exists in the workplace, but E L James beats us over the head with it.  The harasser is SO over the top, and it's stated that he's a habitual offender; it's hard to imagine he could exist and prosper in a real world workplace.  But then, men like Christian don't exist either, so at least James is consistent.<br /><br />On a side note, the most shocking part of this trilogy's success is that the movie rights just sold for $4 million.  I will be very interested to see how these books could be turned into a successful movie franchise.  I don't envy the screenwriter who, no doubt, will need to rewrite every word of dialogue.<br /><br />All this said, congrats to E L James who has made a ton of money from a bad series of books and who has gotten me to read all three, despite myself.<br /><br />Laters, baby.

B005LFQRTC|5.0|I loved this program when on TV and it is even better to watch it now.  Compared to today's TV fare this is far superior.  The special effects are outstanding and holds up well in comparison to the availability and use of current technology, which in my opinion, shows far more imagination than used in the present. The writing is superior and actors were terrific, the imagination in all aspects of this program or almost any program in the past are by far better than 95% of the junk that the public is being force fed in today's HD and digital market....like the song says \\"give me that old time rock and roll\\", goes for TV too.

B003Y5HWMW|5.0|My brother has been telling me about this series for a while and I never really gave it a chance until I decided to get it for him for a Christmas gift. I realize this review is late but I feel that it is well deserved for the acting, story, special effects, and atmosphere that this series on HBO gives to people. When I received the Blu-Ray set in the mail I gave it to my brother right away. As he works and goes to college he has little time throughout the week to watch it and told me if I wanted to I could watch it and get caught up.<br />Boy did I wish he didn't say that. I found myself watching 4 or 5 episodes in a row marveled at the story and the way events unfolded. Honestly I could not guess on what would happen next because this series didn't follow the normal Hero/Good guy always lives plot. This series actually made me frustrated and angry towards it but in a good way because of the star studded cast that portrayed the characters so well. I found myself getting angry with how some decisions were made and what actions some characters chose. I am all caught up in the second season as well and I can say I would recommend this series to so many people.<br /><br />5/5 stars
0071762345|5.0|A great and easy-to-read book that outlines simple strategies for marketing you business or brand. My highlighter hasn't worked this hard since college!

B005K17RU0|2.0|There is a thunderstorm and power is flickering. This says it is just cloudy. I had to look at the radar to see the storm. It used to alert for pending storms but not this one. I fear to trust it since twisters are common here. What a shame. :(@
0307592731|3.0|I am pretty torn on this one. This woman is so bereft as a result of her Mother's early death that she becomes \\"half a bubble off of plumb\\" if not a full one. Dumps her husband in what was supposedly an excellent marriage after sleeping around, falling in with a guy who introduces her to heroin and decides a nice thing to do would be to hike the Pacific Crest Trail which runs from Mexico to Canada. With little prep, little training and limited funds she sets off on her adventure.<br /><br />Why am I torn? This is a well written, excellent story. Great descriptions. Just really tough for me to adjust to the obvious mental illness she is suffering from. Why not continue to Canada after all that? She describes taking pix along the way. Why are they not in the book?
B007J4T2G8|5.0|When I decided to read this book it was based on all the hype that surrounded it. I admit it, I was peer pressured. I have to say though, I am glad that I succumbed to the hype and bought this book. It was awesome. I know that it has a rep as \\"Mommy Porn\\" but Fifty Shades is far beyond that. I found this book a sophisticated love story about bout two people with troubled pasts. This is not a sex crammed book, it is much more than that. At first I was a little thrown by the word usage in the book. Not the graphic language but a more sophisticated language. I am glad I have a dictionary on my Kindle, I learned a lot. Well anyway. I realized that it has to be written this away. It fits the personalities of Christian and Ana.<br />As I read I am sucked into the world that Mrs. James created. I have always thought of BDSM as some dark sex world that is a little deranged. I learn reading that it's not, at least not for Christian. Christian has a rough past, one that he really doesn't speak of in this installment. He was adopted by the Grey's at the age of 4 and treated like the other children. At the age of 15 he was introduced to the BDSM world by his own Mrs. Robinson. He states in the book that it was something that he needed and I think it was. Throughout his life he has had no control over anything which threw him off kilter. When Mrs. Robinson came along, she showed him how to regain the control he lost. Along comes Ana, a pleasant surprise for him. She is innocent and shy. Upon meeting her he assumes that she is a submissive compared to his dominant. They don't immediately begin a relationship, not until one drunken night Christian comes to the rescue. Ana comes off as innocent and shy, but deep down she is more. She never had a relationship with a man before and tends to avoid anything beyond friendship with them. Ana has a past also that is not really mentioned in the book. Her mom hops from one husband to another and husband number two is never talked about. I think that this is why she is hesitant to have a relationship with Christian. When the two of them come to together the roles of sub and dom help them to see that maybe they want more. Christan helps Ana blossom into a woman and Ana helps bring Christan into the world and out of seclusion.  The two change agreeing that they want more. When one of Christian's darker moments goes array and Ana  admits her true feelings, it becomes too much for either one and things end.<br />I was a little upset with the way the book ended, but at least I don't have to wait for the second one, yay. I don't have anything that I really disliked about this book. It was good from beginning to end. I loved the characters, they are dynamic.They all complement each other well.<br />My overall thought of this book is that I loved every aspect of it. It surprised me how much I liked it. I was expecting it to be like most things that have a lot of hype, I was expecting disappointment but got the opposite. I recommend that you read this book. It is my favorite book this year so far. Fifty Shades is intended for mature audiences, 18+ years only.

030746363X|1.0|Mr Ferriss again made many promises at the beginning of the book. I was very disappointed. In my opinion he doesn't keep them.<br /><br />Two examples:<br /><br />1.) He stresses the point that in his book methods are shown where the Pareto principle is used in a more extrem form, i.e. with 5% effort you can reach 95% of the results. Sounds very impressing. For example for the topic weight loss which is a big part of the book, he advertises exactly one diet: From MORE THAN TENTHOUSAND food products in a large American grocery Mr Ferriss allows you to eat about FIVE. Now Mr Ferris, this sounds to me like > 99% effort!<br /><br />2.) He talks about improving an orgasm. What he describes is a trantra-like technique to improve or prolong the orgasm of the women. For the man he obvously has no interest in this respect, instead he describes how more sperms can be reached, e.g. by not carrying your cellphone in your pocket. Now Mr Ferriss: Maybe you know only of the male ejaculation, but many men have real orgasms, too, and it would have been nice to hear of a way to prolong THAT. Sexual discrimination? Men are not only child-producing machines.<br /><br />These may be controversial examples, but they are typical for this book.

0345803507|1.0|I figured I might as well title this review after something I said when I was 13 as this surely must be the age the author is to write such rudimentary and arduous books.  Yes, I did use a thesaurus for those words and I'd be happy to loan mine to the author.  Given the \\"tween\\" way in which this was written I am surprised that Justin Bieber wasn't on the iPod Ana listened to constantly.  In all seriousness, it was PAINFUL (again, no pun intended) to read all 3 books.  And just why did I?  As President Snow said \\"Hope. It is the only thing stronger than fear.\\"  I only quote the Hunger Games in that it is an example of an actual well written written book.  HOPE.  I had HOPED that a plot would evolve. I had HOPED that the supposed subplots would evolve.  I had HOPED that Christian would wake up and realize that he had made a big mistake.  I had HOPED to read something different than the over repetitive words and phrases that are in this.  If I had to read about the sound of ripping foil one more time, I was going to flog the author myself.  He doesn't want to knock her up.  WE GET IT!!!  I was almost if not more so excited as Christian when her birth control kicked in so I wouldn't have to keep reading it. But once again, the author needed something to fill the pages (again and again and again).<br /><br />I understand that the author originally started this out as Twilight Fan Fiction.  Jolly good for her.  Especially since she keeps using British slang and didn't bother to look on a map to make sure all her locations actually were feasible.  Then again, the ever talented baziollionaire, Christian, had Charlie Tango to take him wherever he wanted which is probably just as fast as a vampire can run. It's just creepy how everything mirrors Twilight when she had the opportunity to really make this something.  Characters were beyond mundane.  The \\"storyline\\" never showed itself.  After this last and thank God final book, I'm still wondering what the hell I was reading about.  All the actual subplots (for lack of a better word) were wrapped up in a neat little adolescent package within a page or two.  My inner HOPE Goddess kept me reading just incase something materialized but she hung her head and shook it in disappointment.  I'm just thankful I didn't have to read any Inner Goddess emails.  The best part of the series?  The very last \\"Chapter\\" of the 3rd book.  It was just like Midnight Sun (Stephanie Meyers) and had the point of view that I was desperately searching for in each of these books.<br /><br />And the sex.  Oh the crazy crazy Kink-i-fied sex.  Yeah right.  After the first few fully detailed trysts they became BORING! Even someone with a prudish mind would start to realize the monotony of it all.  And considering I am not prudish, I was bored very quickly.<br /><br />There are a ton of points I can make about how awful this book and the whole series is.  Luckily a lot of other reviewers have done the work for me so no need to be repetitive (And we all know how that feels after reading these books).  Just as I told my friends who asked me if they should bother reading these, my answer was immediately \\"GOD NO!!!\\"  But as I thought about it, I wanted them to.  Why?  For the same reason someone who has found spoiled milk in the fridge makes the person in the room smell it anyway.  I guess I want to have someone else feel my pain.  Or I just want to sell them my books so I can recoup some of the loss.<br /><br />If you want, you can pretend I murmured, whispered, rolled my eyes or had my breath hitch as I typed this.
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game's random dealing is really good, and the custom card cover is awesome. It keeps me entertained for a good while. The only bad part is the advertisements for the other games. And that is all.

0345803485|4.0|I was immediately hooked. I only bought this book because of a bad review I read. Everyone else was saying that it was an amazing read. And it was! Started the second book and could not finish it. Don't want to ruin it for anyone, but the first book is great!
B0063IH60K|5.0|easy to use. I like that you can replay games if you don't win them. ive been playing for days.
B007V5CF5K|5.0|FABULOUS theme, great graphics, light jazzy music that fit the theme and never got annoying, flawless and engaging gameplay. I loved how well the objects blended with the background, and that every item I found was necessary to advance the plot. *Definitely* worth my money. Alawar is one of the very best app producers out there. Please, more like this!
B003B8QS6S|5.0|After coming back from Poland and seeing four death camps I cam across this book in Yad Vashem.I had heard about this book from some self help book and never realized that 3 million copes were sold.

B006OOHYIC|5.0|Fun and challenging. Nice additional twists from Quell. It helps to look backward from the desired result, sometimes. Other times you have to look from left field.
B0014BY72Q|3.0|I first saw Logan's Run in 1982 or 1983. Our local theater had a \\"beat the heat\\" special where you could see some \\"older\\" movies for a dollar during the super hot summer months.<br />I saw Logan's Run one hot July afternoon and liked the movie itself quite a bit.<br />The other main reason I remember it so well, is, even though it is rated PG the scene where they come out of the river and into the frozen section featured the main actress in full frontal nudity. (hey, I was 13 or 14 at the time, you remember certain things)<br />I hadn't thought about the movie in a long time and saw something that reminded me of it and ordered the DVD. Well the nude scene has been redacted by a few frames or so and now features the actress topless only.<br />The actress by the way is Jenny Agutter, who later went on to appear in An American Werewolf in London. Again fully nude and again on the DVD edited down.<br />I'm guessing if I order M*A*S*H* on DVD the shower scene will be cut too?
B00371V6SE|2.0|Grrr at this book! I've never read Sparks before but because I enjoyed The Lucky One film, I decided to give the book a chance. I'm not into romance chick lit at all and reading this just solidified my opinion.<br /><br />What was annoying about this book is that it had so much potential and by the midway point I was enjoying it. It started with an intriguing premise and some interesting characters. Sparks built up tension and set the stage for things to go horribly wrong and then? Nothing! *Potential spoiler alert* - nothing really bad happened. The characters just breeze through their emotional problems, never really dealing with stuff and everything just works out in the favour of the MCs. So annoying! Maybe it's because I like dark and twisted writing that this story just fell flat for me, too vanilla and way too pedestrian. The author's prose is really dull at times, the dialogue even worse making his characters sound wooden and juvenile despite them constantly talking about maturity.<br />I think this story could have been great had Sparks not suffered from 'nice writer' syndrome (and a lack of creativity when it came to description), had he not been afraid to really hurt his characters. I really wanted Clayton to set Thibault up, throw him in jail, get him beaten up by the local meth addicts, kill Logan's dog (not to hurt the animal but to intensify the conflict), make a mess of his life etc. There was so much potential for character development and it just went NOWHERE! Wish I'd hated this book, then it wouldn't bug me so much that it could've been so much better.<br /><br />There were some parts of the book I felt were better in the film, and vice versa. Overall though, I think both suffered from the same 'too nice' failing without daring to get dirty by delving deeper into the conflict.<br /><br />There, I did it. I read a Sparks novel. Probably won't read another one.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I downloaded the excerpt of this book, and immediately upon reading that I had to buy the book!! I couldn't put it down. I read all 3 within a week!! I'd highly recommend it to any woman needing a pick me up.. ;)

B004XZ99LO|1.0|Let's start by saying that I love Cirque, and all of their live shows. I wish this was one of them. Instead, it's a very short kid's show, and a boring one at that. It has none of the pizazz of one of their live shows, and left me wanting something, well, anything else. Really, if you're going to put out a 3D blu ray, it should be your best material, not your worst...<br /><br />Next time, put a real show on 3D blu ray!

0345803507|5.0|By far my favorite triology EVER! I'm hooked in every way. I love the characters, they're very relatable and easy to fall in love with as you go on their journey. EL James writes in a way that makes you never want to put the books down. Although it gets lots of media attention for its \\"erotic romance\\" label, it's far more than that. I'd go as far to say one of the most beautiful, real love stories of this generation. I'd recommend this series to anyone that needs proof of what \\"love\\" really is and that true love is out there and hard to ignore- no matter how hard you try to push it away! I'm already reading it for the second go around! LOVE LOVE LOVE Fifty Shades of Grey/Darker/Freed!! I hope EL James finds a way to write more books to this series!!!!
B005D4YGXK|4.0|I was looking for a shoe that could hold up to the different conditions in Hawaii. When I found Keen I knew they would be perfect for my adventure trip. Well, it's after the trip and they lasted 11 days of hiking in valleys, swimming in the ocean, and camping. I really liked the toe cap because it prevented my toes from getting stubbed. The only dislike is if they become wet from walking through a river they take a long time to dry off. Overall, I would recommend these to everyone.

B00170GXQ2|1.0|It does not help that I just got down reading the novel, which was excellent, but this movie was terriable, the acting, the plot (crowded and lacking a red storyline or character development).  The sexual overtones were annoying and did not help the story. There was little to like about this movie.

B003O86FMW|4.0|Back in the arena! This time it's double the adventure and double the body count. Katniss is even more fierce, this time fighting for two. The game makers are also more fierce - vicious even - and more unrelenting. It's great to meet victors from other districts and to be conflicted on who to root for - besides our fearless warrior Katnids, of course. The intriguing ending will leave you \\"hungry\\" for The Mockingjay!
B007J4T2G8|2.0|I was very disappointed. I was hoping something more. The characters are in their early  and late 20s and the overall theme is a girl getting the rich [and sick] guy. Not a good role model for young women!
B0070NSPCU|5.0|A very well written book.  Similar in style to Patrick Rothfuss' The Kingkiller Chronicle, I couldn't put it down once I started.

0393061310|5.0|Guns, Germs and Steel could have been edited a little.  It was very wordy, but most informative about looking at history and its complexities.  I found it most useful for understanding the interaction between history, land, climate, food plants and progressive development of a society.

B006VFLIYK|4.0|Baldacci has created a new character and that is a plus. It was time for something new. I actually enjoyed the support characters in the book the most, such as the girl he is protecting, Detective Vance and \\"Blue Man\\". There are plenty of twist and turns to keep one's interest. It is not the best Baladacci book I've read but it is refreshing, comepared to his recent work. Will hold your attention and is a good Summer read.....
B0036T31YY|3.0|Well, this movie didn't make a lot of sense to me.  I'm reminded of some Star Trek episodes where the crew keeps repeating a block of time until they figure out how to get out of it.  There were just too many holes in this movie in my opinion.  Too many times I kept saying, \\"Look honey, just go out and talk to them\\"!  And at the end, where there were three copies of the woman, dead one in the trunk of the car, dead one on the road and the live one standing by.  How did she end up on the beach?<br />  This movie had potential, but I feel the writers just didn't know how to finish it.  I watched it for free, so at least I didn't lose any money over it.
1400069289|4.0|I have seen a review of this book in my local newspaper. The quotations in the review raised a number of questions:<br /><br />Quotation 1: \\"Habits, scientists say, emerge because the brain is constantly looking for ways to save effort.\\"<br />  Query 1: What scientists? All scientists? Most scientists? Some scientists? A few scientists? Hardly any scientists?<br />  Query 2: With what is the brain looking for ways to save effort?<br />  Query 3: How does the brain measure its own effort?<br /><br />Quotation 2: \\"Left to its own devices, the brain will try to make almost any routine into a habit, because habits allow it to ramp down more often.\\"<br />  Query 1: Left to its own devices wouldn't the brain just die?<br />  Query 2: How can the brain try anything without the rest of the physiology of the organism?<br />  Query 3: Isn't a habit just a behavioral routine?<br />  Query 4: Why does the brain need to \\"ramp down\\"? And why \\"more often\\"? What does \\"ramp down\\" even mean?<br /><br />The reviewer says that according to Duhigg, bad habits and not eliminated when replaced by good habits. Instead they are overwritten.<br />  Query: Isn't being overwritten the same thing as being eliminated? Or does Duhigg mean that bad habits are \\"over-ridden\\", like sometimes, in some circumstances, one rule has precedence over another rule?<br /><br />But I'll give the book the benefit of my doubts and give it four stars.

B006MVJ2L4|5.0|Trespassing features an innovative infusion of retro styles including club, rock and funk, brought up-to-date with sounds new to any genre. I'm fascinated by the 2-star reviews posted here that express disappointment because Trespassing isn't a rock album. Adam Lambert may well have the vocal ability to become the next Robert Plant or Freddie Mercury, but Trespassing was conceived and promoted as a pop album and should be evaluated on that basis. With this sophomore album Adam had the luxury of time to enforce his artistic vision. While the tracks include some amazing rock wails, this collection is sufficiently cohesive to drive home the fact that at least at this point in his musical evolution, Adam is a pop artist at heart. Don't buy this album if you're not open to music that doesn't neatly fit the rock genre-- even the power ballads on the \\"dark side\\" of Trespassing combine Adam's incredible rock vocals with modern electropop and sophisticated, cutting-edge production. That said, he's created a masterful pop album... and unlike most of the hits currently in heavy rotation on CHR, his lyrical messages are consistently both powerful and nuanced. I'm looking forward to hearing Adam's rock side when he fronts Queen this summer, but I predict that Adam's own style in the future is more likely to move into new and groundbreaking territory than back to the sound of Led Zeppelin.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This is an exciting continuation of book one.  The character development continues in Fifty Shades Darker.  The relationship between Anastasia and Christian blossoms and book two really sucks you into the trilogy.  The entire trilogy is an exciting read.
B001E45XT4|5.0|I bought the Plantronics Gamecom 367 headset, and have been using it for about a month now.  So far the mic has been really good, you can turn the volume up very loud if you need to or really quiet quickly with the spin wheel, the wire of the headset is a nice size, about 4-5 feet, which was good because I sit a distance away from my computer.  The head set was comfortable, although the mic moves sometimes and puts pressure on my ears.  My biggest problem is that it isn't  noise cancelling, which would have been really nice, but not really a fault since they didn't make it as such.  I bought this headset on sale for $15 so my rating is a bit skewed, for  the price I paid I would give it a 5/5, for the original $60 price i would give it a 4/5.
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie was awesome. It's definitely going on my list of movies that I watch when I need inspiration.  It provides a small glimpse into the sacrifices that the men of the U.S. special ops community make for our country and for their brother operators. One of the things that sets this movie apart from others is it also provides insight to the sacrifices made not just by the men but by their families as well.  It serves as a reminder of how grateful I am for all the U.S service men and women, and especially men like the ones in this movie.<br /><br /> In my opinion, this movie stands out in a world of movies filled with hollywood fiction, B.S., and movie magic. It provides more realistic action without going over the top like your average shoot em up movie. If you want typical hollywood cheesy action then go watch the charlie sheen rendition of navy seals. To me, this movie is more about the message, the inspiration, and the feeling of gratitude that you take away from it.<br /><br />Many thanks for these seals, the other men of the special ops community, and all the men and women serving around the world. The next time you are thinking of how much you enjoy freedom. Thank the next soldier you see.<br /><br />-People sleep peaceably in their beds at night only because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf-

0061726834|5.0|A lover of trilogies, this series caught my eye in the Kindle store. After recently reading the \\"50 Shades of Gray\\" trilogy, I thought nothing would beat it... that is, until I read Delirium. This book is a page-turner, and one that kept me up until all hours of the night, eyes drooping and all, unable to pry away from it long enough to sleep. Lauren Oliver created an interesting, thought-provoking storyline with a main character that totally transforms, 360 degrees, before your eyes. After reading Pandemonium, the sequel to this book, I am on the edge of my seat, just WAITING for the release of the final book, Requiem. This is a must read, and in my opinion will catch everyone's attention in the near future.
B0070NSPCU|5.0|I normally don't rate the books that I buy from Amazon but this book blew me away. One of the main reasons I bought this book was because of all the positive ratings it had received. Everyone had given it a 5 stars rating. So I decided that I should get the book and was amazed at how well this book told a story. I strongly recommend this book to any one who likes a story well told. So here I am giving the book 5 stars because as soon as I set this book down I looked up to see if there was a sequel and was disappointed that a release date had not even been picked for it.
B007PS0X0W|2.0|I wasn't expecting much and that was a let down.<br />The first TWO Underworlds were fun, the 3rd was ok, but this one just sucked.<br />The story has absolutely NO surprises. The action lacked action and everything was filmed Dark Dark Dark, maybe so they could save money on their lack of set, action and story.<br />At least Kate looked good.<br /><br />Very disappointed. If this was a food product, I'd return it for being spoiled and get my money back!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|By far these are the best triology ever. I could not put the books down. Must read!!! Great story line and juicy sex talk.
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|I absolutely LOVED this game before the last update. Now every time I open the app to try to play, it tells me that it's &quot;checking for updates,&quot; but then tells me I'm not connected to the Internet even though I am.

B000FA57RG|5.0|Madonna has gone from dance diva to cerebral stimulator. While her career has been benchmarked by many outrageous antics that have pushed the boundaries of societal norms, this video shows the human side to the artist. There are versions of this that include the audio concert and then another disc of DVD footage. Some have complained that the DVD wasn't a full concert and sadly, those with that complaint have sorely missed the points, issues, mental cogitation and compassion that the artist is trying to convey. We see the fulminating development from dancer auditions, sound checks and spiritual introspection. We see the thought process, insecurities, fallibility and human side of Madonna interspersed with clips from various shows around the globe. For those who have grown up with Madonna at the outset of her career and have remained hardcore to her work, this video brings her to a new level of growth and development that she is not only working very hard on herself, but also asking that we look inward as well. If the video portion doesn't move one to tears at any point during the viewing, then that person has a LOT of inner work to do.<br />In the end, this video among the many that she has done in her career, will stand head and tails above all else she has done. Not because of dazzling dances or catchy songs but because Madonna exposes so many veins of emotion in the hope that we can become a better world for future generations. If thinking that hard about life is too much for people, then move on from this until you are ready. Otherwise, kudos to Madonna and her crew for sharing their world with us and imploring that we wake up before it is too late.
0345803485|3.0|I would probably be less dissapointed in this book if it didn't have such great reviews.  It also didn't help that I read Gabaldon's Outlander just before Fifty shades and I find it thousand times better than Fifty shades of gray. I'm getting tired of hysterical, teenage heroines throwing fits and being insecure all the time. I know Ana is not a teen, but she behaves like one - no doubt about it. Christian Gray is not the only adolescent in this relationship. I'm also not into BDSM so some of the love scenes are totaly boring to me. I can't help it but I don't find anything sexy or erotic in spanking, bondage .....  It's true this book is not all about BDSM but I do think readers who are attracted by it will be more into it than the ones who are not. I just skipped those scenes. Ana is immature, selfish and unsecure - like many tenage girls would be - but she's not a teenager anymore. I can only hope the two of them will mature and grow up together in future. Story is a classical cliche about prince charming - although somehow on the gray side (he's georgeous, beautiful, smart, well dressed, rich ......) and cinderella (beautuiful but poor, minus wicked step sisters)with some elements of BDSM thrown in. I'm glad I got it from the library.  If I had to buy it for this price, I would have a feeling I threw my money away.<br /><br />So: if you like unsecure teenage heroines throwing fits and being unsecure about their relationships all the time - this is book for you.<br /><br />If you like some BDSM in your sex, this book will probably appeal to you<br /><br />If you aren't attracted to the above - skip it and save your time (and money) for some other book.

B005DC68NI|5.0|If you have any interest in publishing a book but are unsure where to start, start with Let's Get Digital. David Gaughran does more in this accessible book than any other single guide to get you in a position to self-publish.<br /><br />In turns practical, polemical and inspirational, Let's Get Digital will get you published. Our Man is aware this review is sounding a bit like advertising copy, he doesn't mean it to be, it's just that this is an excellent book that does what it sets out to do, with aplomb.<br /><br />For a while Our Man was undecided about self-publishing, preferring to take a middle road \\"all publishing is equally good, each to their own, blah blah blah\\" approach, but the more he learns about self-publishing and the traditional alternative, the more he is convinced self-publishing (and ebooks) will be the dominant form very soon.<br /><br />You might as well get on the right side of history, and this book is the place to start.
B005GSZZ1A|2.0|the content was informative but it read like a high school text book  rather than interesting story. It was a chore to finish.
B004J73WZ0|2.0|I got this set from Germany for $15.00.  At $40, it is not worth it.  Anyone new to Mahler should get a set in modern sound.  There are many available sets but I particularly like the Gary Bertini on EMI.<br />The recordings in this Membran set are from the 40s and 50s and the sound quality ranges from good to awful even though most of the performances are very good.<br />Symphony #1, Kubelik and the Vienna Symphony.  Good recording and pleasant laid-back performance by Kubelik in what appears to be his first recording of this symphony.<br />Symphony #2  Klemperer and Concertgebouw.  Made at about the same time as his EMI release with the Philharmonia, but much better.  The Dutch orchestra is a real Mahler orchestra.  Listen to those strings dig in at the start of the first movement. An excellent performance with fair sound quality.<br />Symphony #3. Boult and the BBC Symphony.  The sound is so bad that it is impossible to judge the performance.<br />Symphony #4. Reiner and the Chicago Symphony.  A classic performance, well recorded. A great recording.<br />Symphony #5  Walter and the NY Philharmonic.  Another classic performance but the recording is very shrill.  Way too much treble.<br />Symphony #6  Mitropoulous and the NY Philharmonic.  Very good performance but only fair recorded sound.  The Barbirolli recording is my favorite.<br />Symphony #7  Rosbaud and Baden-Baden radio orchestra.  Surprise!! Good sound quality and a lovely performance.  One of the best that I have ever heard.<br />Symphony #8  Stokowski and the NY Philharmonic.  I doubt that any recording will ever capture the overwhelming sound of this symphony.  The recording and performance are acceptable, like most of the other available recordings.  I was recently privileged to attend a peformance of this symphony in Buenos Aires where the conductor placed the brass ensemble for the last movement amongst the audience sitting in the upper seats.  The blending of the sounds coming from that brass and the orchestra on the stage was staggering.<br />Symphony #9  Rosbaud and Baden-Baden radio orchestra.  The recording and performance are acceptable but not as good as in Symphony #7<br />The Song of the Earth  Walter and the Vienna Philharmonic.  Only just acceptable.  The recorded sound is fair, but Ferrier as soloist doesn't thrill.<br /><br />Summary:  Poor sound reproduction has ruined what should have been a great set.
B0026NWBY2|5.0|This cd is full of great hits,and is great music to lay back to easy it is listening.So i reccomend this cd!
B0052VUNHC|3.0|I liked the booked alot however it is a much lighter read in comparison to Fifty Shades or Gabriel's Inferno.  Not just because of the PG rating but the character development is limited  so I never felt connected to them. At times, it seemed characters were just placed in the story, alonst to full space (I.e. Finch, Bart, Kara)  And there  were chuncks of time missing almost as if just to get to the Valentines Day dance.<br /><br />It was more superficial then I typically like but  I would recommend for a beach read but not for a sophisticated/advanced reader.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|its ok its fun-ish but u get like 30 seconds of each game passes time but gets boring easy. its not terrible but no great its just ok... prob wouldn't buy again u hag to unlock each game which takes a lot.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I really like this game. Great game for passing time. Its. an Irish Mario. I will let my grandson play with. I think he will love it. This game has great graphics.
B007V2UGPE|4.0|pretty good way to kill time. like the way health regenerates after time so you can fall back and regroup.

B0013FSL3E|5.0|Pixar can truely dazzle us with their incredibly remarkable animated films. Ever since they changed the world of film with their 1995 film \\"Toy Story\\", they went on to have many other unforgettable movies (A Bug's Life, Monsters, Inc, and The Incredibles), but after I saw their 2008 masterpiece \\"WALL-E\\", It has becomed my most favorite Pixar movie ever. With it's wonderfully combined story of science fiction, action, romance and its environmental message, it will win anyone over.<br /><br />The film opens in the year 2805 with the little robot WALL-E who is the only one of his kind when Earth is just a abandoned planet completely covered in garbage, while his job is to clean the planet by forming the garbage into cubes and stacking them together. The reason of the Earth's trashy problem is that almost 700 years ago when a mega-corporation call Buy-N-Large has damaged the environment with its numerous consumer products, that it's plan was to clean the Earth with their army of WALL-E cleaning bots, but when the plan failed and the planet started to grow too toxic, BNL had no choice but to bring humanity to space as a last resort. Now with the planet still in trash, WALL-E continues to clean it up, and while doing so, he finds many great treasures as well (ex. Rubik's cube, Twinkies, iPods, Zippo lighters, car alarms, ring cases, fire extinguishers, etc.). Later, he unexpectedly sees a spaceship land where he works and out comes a sleek white egg-shaped robot probe called EVE, and in no time WALL-E falls \\"head over wheels\\" for her and shows her what he does, but when he shows her a living plant that he found, she turns off completely and when the spaceship retrives her, WALL-E will go a ride and then goes on a journey that will determine the fate of humanity and robots as well.<br /><br />I'll start by saying that in the first minute of the film, \\"WALL-E\\" immediately won me over. Ever since then, I've seen it so many times that i pretty much know the entire movie. Pixar has given us something completely different, that will entertain both kids and adults. The kids will love the funniness and cuteness of WALL-E, EVE, and all the other robots they'll meet and see. Adults will love the superb storytelling, the wonderful score,the romance between WALL-E and EVE, and the nature of the movie, even though no dialogue is spoken for nearly 40 minutes. But importantly, \\"WALL-E\\" also gives us a envirormental message to protect our Earth, and to take care of it for a better future. But no matter what, \\"WALL-E\\" will always have a special place in my heart.r has given us something completely different, that will entertain both kids and adults.

B003NJPOAQ|5.0|When I first heard one of Jack Johnson's song, I thought he had a perfect sense of rhythm and beat, and now I am a big fan of his and listen to his music all the time. \\"To The Sea\\" may be his most perfect album yet, and even a great choice for you to listen to during the hot summer season. Many of the songs have their own different beat, but they all are perfect and wonderful.<br /><br />1. You and Your Heart - A petfect start to the album and the bst song to listen to (A+).<br />2. To The Sea - The title song is wonderful and even a little down (B+).<br />3. No Good With Faces - A swiftly tilty song with a catchy tune (A).<br />4. At or With Me - An awesone song to dance to with its upbeat sound (A).<br />5. When I Look Up - Despite being under a minute, it's a great song and touching to the heart and one of my favorites on the album (A+).<br />6. From The Clouds - A song that's definitely perfect to listen to in your backyard (A).<br />7. My Little Girl - A touching tribute song to a man and his daughter (A).<br />8. Turn Yur Love - A bit of a toneddown song but an enjoyable song (B).<br />9. The Upsetter - One song that will get that bad mood of your body and put you in a good mood (A).<br />10.

1400069289|5.0|This book is a good companion to last year's Willpower.  Both have a solid scientific background and teach you how to make small changes that lead to larger ones.
B0013F1D02|5.0|What a gem!  Michelle Pfeiffer is hilariously evil, Robert De Niro is certifiable, and everything comes together beautifully in this well-executed romp.  If you're in the mood for some light-hearted action wrapped in a love story and served on a bed of giggles, make yourself a big bowl of popcorn and watch this movie.  You'll never look at the stars the same way again.
B006UG90RM|5.0|There is very little compelling music out there, granted tons of it but mostly garbage.  This M****FR rocks and is a 2012 staple. Have to stop myself from playing it daily. Great work gents! Almost every tune a hit.  Creativity through the roof, great sound.  Even the thrown together ones steam.  Who could ask for more?
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I used this app EVERYDAY until I installed the newest update yesterday. Now, it doesn't work. Then I decided to remove it and reinstall the app itself. Guess what.... it let me install it now. I know others who have had the same issue since the update.
B00006I53S|1.0|I bought this lens about 2 years ago with my 50D.  First thing I noticed was the lens creep - the lens slides out VERY easily if held at any downward angle, very annoying.  The worst part is, after very little use, but just out of the warranty period, the auto-focus stopped working!!  Google it, these two issues are incredibly common.  None of the suggested fixes worked for me and Canon wants $150 just to look at it!  Canon ought to be ashamed for producing such junk and then not repairing their mistake.  Very disappointed.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I really like to play this game. I just started but even though you have touch the screen to move the guy it is really to move.
B0021L8UQ2|4.0|4 1/2 Stars = Minor Masterpiece<br /><br />Man, this film is as a about white knuckled & high tensioned as you can get. It's a thrill ride to end all thrill rides for movies about evil kids! This film is every parents with their own children, who adopts an outside older child worse nightmare, & then some! It's a hair raising back of you neck horror film, yes, horror film, & has a ending that is just as explosive as it's mind blowing. You get some clues along the way, but even so, it blows your mind!<br /><br />Actress, Isabelle Fuhrman, as the adopted child, \\"Esther, is the personification of a twisted sick mind. Pure unadulterated evil! Soulless black doll eyes, that penetrates you to your bone marrow, & makes you realize with crystal clear horror, that a child can be a very dangerous creature! She should've got an Oscar nomination for her portrayal as Esther! She is this film! She works her character like a spider spinning a web, a web of deciet, ready to ensnare her victims in a deadly embrace of cold as ice, evil brutality!<br /><br />Many critics dismissed this film as just anothe \\"Bad Seed\\" clone, & not a great one at that. I don't know what film they were watching, but surely not this one! If you like sitting on the edge of your seat, with your hands clenched hard, wondering what is going to happen next, than \\"Orphan,\\" is your ticket to parent's hell. Enjoy the ride & hope it never happens to you!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a good way to pass time and to play before bed to relax. really glad that I ended up getting it.
0385534639|5.0|I am almost done with this book and I am feeling sad because I don't want it to end. The book itself is as magical and transportive as the Night Circus itself. Morganstern is that rare writer who can tell a great tale, create individual and unique characters while creating an atmosphere all to itself. I don't know how to explain it but some books just have a hum that is consistent from beginning to end. Each time I pick it up I shut out the world and enter the one she created. The story moves on quickly but also luxuriously rich so that  time passes with out notice. I love this book.
B005PO5U10|5.0|So I am watching this episode at work and totally gave myself away with my uncontrollable laughter!! Howard is often the character who makes me laugh the most (as is Sheldon).  The scene between Howard and Raj when they are testing the kissing machine for Skype is just too much!!  I love this show!

B007V2UGPE|4.0|makes you pay to get past a low level cap. kept spamming me requests to rate the stupid thing too. disappointing.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|I purchased without reading the reviews first; never again. The few chapters I read were equivalent to listening to a stand up comedian who intersperses foul language as a cover for the fact he really isn't funny. I can't even bring myself to finish the book with the hope that it has some redeeming qualities. To be fair, I would not have purchased it in the first place had I paid attention to the genre; another mistake I won't make again. I wish I could sell my copy -- I could describe the book condition as virginal.
B007TNQ7EY|4.0|This game is a lot of fun, but it crashes a lot. It crashes mid game, but mostly before you hit the Start/Continue button. Lots of GTA style action in between crashes.
B0070066DI|4.0|I purchased this heat sink because of its low profile.  I needed it to fit within my son's and mine desktop cases (I bought two).  It has worked very well on the Asus Rampage IV Gene motherboard and Intel 3820 processor I installed in both computers.  The cases for both computers could not handle other heat sinks that stand tall over the processor.  The case side and air funnels got in the way.  The one problem I did encounter is the corsair ram I purchased to go with the system that have their own heat sinks.  The ram was so close to the CPU that the ram heat sinks prevented this CPU heat sink from resting on the processor.  I fixed this problem by removing the ram heat sinks which lowered their overall hieght.  This heat sink then fit very nicely.  I do not overclock my sytem so heat has not been a problem.  If you do overclock your system you will need to make sure the heat sink you buy has the cooling capcity you need and will fit on the processor within your case.
B000BSNPRG|5.0|It is a PAL DVD not NTSC, please take note of this when you buy it. as you see in the photos, it is a Super Jewel Box that holds both discs, i would prefer to keep them separated, just to avoid scratches (just in case).Recomended concert
B006YM9JSW|4.0|At the time I bought this processor it wasn't the fastest on the market but it was very afordable.  After installing one in my computer and another in my son's computer with new motherboards and ram the Microsoft performance index went up from 5.0 to 7.9.  Made a big difference in the games my son and I were playing.  It does not come with a heat sink so make sure you pick out one that will fit an LGA 2011 socket and within your desktop case.  Watch out for motherboards that have the ram sockets real close to the CPU this sometimes interfers with the heat sink placement.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|really like this game on my Kindle Fire so far. easy to navigate and fun to play. would purchase again.
B00723NWJE|3.0|This album would have been 5 stars had it not been for the production.  Norah Jones has an amazing voice and her lyrics are some of the most beautiful and moving I have heard from her in a while.  That being said, I am personally not that happy with the music on the album.  The music tracks make the CD sound at times like a chillout remix album while the other tracks sound like they were attempting to recreate a 70s psychedelic album (a sound that does not work with the lyrics or the way the artists sounds at all).<br /><br />So that being said, lyrics and singing: great. Music: ranges from tolerable to horrible.
B00846F1YW|5.0|I loved it! At first I thought it might be too easy. It was very good! Worth the money. I would buy more from Nevosoft.

1571200851|3.0|The concept is great, and the flowers are beautiful - if a tad fiddly.  The instructions are a little hazy on some points, and I had problems getting my \\"petals\\" to come out evenly.

0451228375|3.0|This book, \\"World Without End,\\" is not a terrible read, but it was a little too familiar to me.  A red-haired man who has great skill building must face adversity in order to be with the head-strong, independent woman he loves?  Sound familiar, doesn't it?  This book is basically \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" set with more caricatured characters.  \\"Pillars of the Earth\\" is a wonderful read, one of my favorite books, while \\"World Without End\\" to me feels like Follett is taking the same basic story and retelling it with some slight variations, and doesn't come close to impact the original novel had.  Merthin, Ralph, Caris and Gwenda don't compare to Jack, Aliena, Ellen, Philip and William.  This book was too familiar for my tastes, and it just didn't do it for me.

Ran it on a le pan II tablet!<br />Not only a hidden object game, but also have to find parts of images that combine to create objects that become interactive to solve the game.  I wish there were more games like this.  Big Fish games makes some great ones for the mac,  but have not yet done the same with many android games.
1401937519|5.0|If you are like me, you don't think much about death.  As those close to us pass away, though, the question will inevitably come up: \\"What will happen to me when I die?\\"<br /><br />Anita Moorjani had that question, too, before being stricken with cancer.  In her new book \\"Dying To Be Me: My Journey From Cancer, To Near Death, To True Healing\\" she tells a fascinating story of her brush with death, and in the process gives hope and comfort to those of us who would rather avoid the subject.<br /><br />I like how Moorjani delays getting into her cancer diagnosis until chapter five.  In the early pages the reader gets to know Anita through her stories of her youth.  \\"Because of my Hindu roots, I grew up to believe in karma and reincarnation,\\" she writes, yet she attended a Catholic grade school.  The conflicts in these two belief systems became apparent to Moorjani early in life.  A Catholic classmate tells her \\"You need to tell your parents to take you to church to pray to God every Sunday, otherwise you won't get to heaven when you die.\\"  Later she tells of backing out of an arranged marriage, and how she meets her future husband Danny.  We get a full picture of the \\"pre-cancer\\" Anita, with the cultural and family issues she had to work through.<br /><br />When Moorjani's best friend Soni is diagnosed with cancer, as well as her husband's brother-in-law, she is paralyzed with fear that she, too, may get this dreaded disease.  Soon thereafter she discovers a lump on her shoulder, and her worst fears are realized after a medical exam.  She has lymphoma.  Moorjani tries yet is frustrated with various alternative healing methods.  \\"I didn't know what was good for me and what wasn't, because each system of healing espoused a different truth, and they all conflicted with each other,\\" she writes.  \\"This confusion only added to my already overwhelming fears.  And as the terror tightly gripped me in its vice once more, I watched helplessly as my health rapidly deteriorated.\\"<br/><br />Moorjani describes in detail her hospital stay, and the painful tests she had to endure.  Eventually she loses consciousness and her husband is given this grave diagnosis from her doctor: \\"There's nothing we can do for your wife.  Her organs have already shut down.  She has tumors the size of lemons throughout her lymphatic system, from the base of her skull to below her abdomen.  She won't even make it through the night.\\"<br /><br />Moorjani relates her feelings of being detached from her body during this time.  \\"What I can only describe as superb and glorious unconditional love surrounded me, wrapping me tight as I continued to let go,\\" she writes.  \\"The term unconditional love really doesn't do justice to the feeling, as these words have been overused to the point of having lost their intensity.\\"  With this feeling of peace and love she returns to consciousness, and miraculously her body starts to heal on its own.  Her doctors are baffled.<br /><br />The best part of the book are the concluding chapters, where Moorjani explains her new understanding of God, Spirituality, and life with the lessons her near death experience taught her.  She posts her story on the internet, where it is discovered by inspirational author Wayne Dyer.  Though reluctant at first to tell of her experience to a wider audience, Dyer encourages her to publish a book and appear with him at various conferences.<br /><br />Anita Moorjani's book at first glance appears to be about death and how we can better deal with it.  But it is really a story about life.  Grounded in an understanding of the unconditional love of God, she encourages the reader to \\"express your uniqueness fearlessly, with abandon!  That's why you're made the way you are, and that's why you're here in the physical world.\\"<br /><br />This is another book review in my partnership with Hay House.  I was not financially compensated for this post. I received the book from Hay House for review purposes. The opinions are completely my own based on my experience.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this game is challenging and really fun.i really lime this game and its really easy to get lost into. my family and i really enjoy this game a lot.
B0083GQ2A0|1.0|Possibly one of the worst movies I've seen in the last 5 years.  Obviously, the director did not do any research about wolf packs or wolf behavior.  Also, the sound effects that they used were completely unrealistic - the most ridiculous being the \\"growling\\" sound emitted from the wolves - this was actually a sound that elephants use to communicate with each other, not wolves.  The special effects with the green eyes in the wolves and the wolves themselves were awful displaying how a low-budget film should not try for special effects like these.  I can't believe that Liam Neeson wasted his time filming this story with sub-par writing and poor directing.
B0035WKP5K|5.0|Excellent book that helped me focus on the exercises I needed to  do and what muscles that I would work.
B007KZY1YY|5.0|Another success by E.L.James.  Not to long after I finished the 2nd book to the trilogy, I was onto this book, and couldn't wait to unfold the story more of A & C.  I enjoyed this book more than the first one because you get to see their relationship unfold more and more and the two characters grow so much more. I finished this book in about 3 days and then have started on the last book of the trilogy, Fifty Shades Freed.  Definetly another page turner, and I stayed up so late o night just dying to find out what happens between A & C.  Would recommend to a friend or to anyone looking for a good book that will keep them hook and flicking the pages faster than they can even imagine.
B007EC27QM|5.0|great calculator! much easier to use than any others I have tried. thanks for a great product. well worth the 99 cents!
B007L3BMGA|5.0|I started reading this book on my way home from a business trip and I literally started it and didn't think to much of it. The beginning was a bit slow for take off for me but after about the 2-3 chapter, I was really starting to get into it. It is really addicting and you just keep wanting to flip the pages. It is actually quite amazing how fast I read this book because it was pretty long and detailed in each and every way. I stayed up till wee hours of the night just craving to find out what happened next between Anastasia and Christian.  E.L.James did an excellent job on this book because she captures the readers attention with so many descriptive details, I almost wish i could have been a fly on the wall watching all the events take place. it is a great love story with a twist on it with a bit of eroticism. I enjoyed reading this book and couldn't help myself to go onto the second one Fifty Shades Darker.  Definetly a book that is a page turner and something that once you start you cannot put down. I recommended to a friend of mine and it was so fun to talk about together. So anyone looking for a intriguing book to read that they wont be able to put down, I would recommend this one.

B00005Y7AW|5.0|Poses is the second album by Rufus Wainwright. Written mostly while he was staying in New York's famous Chelsea Hotel, the album took almost two years to record and was released in 2001, three years after his debut. 11 years later many consider it his best album. It's certainly a unique album in his discography, with a clearly defined and consistent sound, as well as a tone and aura that hasn't been seen in his music before or since. Besides the largely piano and voice album [[ASIN:B0038JH3AU All Days Are Nights: Songs For Lulu]], Poses is his most simplistic, least extravagant record and the album that should have made him a household name. It's a sad truth that not too many people know who Rufus Wainwright is, but when I meet someone who does I've noticed a trend of them knowing the song Cigarettes and Chocolate Milk. It's arguably one of his most identifiable songs; a beautiful track that certainly had the potential to be a commercial hit. Hearing this song by accident in the trailer for a Frnech film a couple years ago is what exposed me to his music. The song is so great that it's on the album twice. The reprise has some added percussion and seems like an unnecessary addition, but I don't mind its inclusion.<br /><br />If I were to describe Poses in one word, it would be hypnotic. This is an album with atmosphere that casts a spell over the listener. The first 8 songs alone make it a masterwork. The phenomenal Greek Song is arguably one of Rufus' best songs, with a melody that projects quiet emotion and true feeling. The title track is inarguably one of his best songs and I can't help but think it may be one of the most beautiful songs ever recorded. With his soft, achingly beautiful voice at the forefront; it's a painfully honest document of what was going on in his life at the time. And who else but Rufus Wainwright could pull off a line like \\"I did go from wanting to be someone, now I'm drunk and wearing flip-flops on Fifth Avenue\\" so flawlessly?<br /><br />The dreamy, hypnotic, and funky Shadows is followed by California, another song that had the potential to bring him commercial success. It may be the catchiest song on the record. The Tower of Learning is a lovely, soaring track while the catchy, piano-driven Grey Gardens has lyrics that cleverly intertwine themes and characters from the film of the same name and the book/film Death in Venice. Finally, Rebel Prince is a soft, mostly acoustic song with whispered vocals (sung in French at one point) that just seethes beauty.<br /><br />The latter half admittedly isn't as strong as what came before it, but it's still powerful. The Consort has some beauty to it, but has never impressed me as much as the other tracks. It's one of those songs that either languishes in the background or prompts you to skip it. One Man Guy is a song originally written and recorded by his father Loudon Wainwright III. Given Rufus' sexuality, he adds irony, humor, and another layer of depth to this great tune that rivals his father's version.<br /><br />Evil Angel is the most atmospheric song on the record, with the closest resemblance to the extravagant compositions you'll find on his later records. Meanwhile, In a Graveyard is simply a short, minimalist track of just piano and voice that may be his highest lyrical achievement on the record. The albm ends with the bonus track Across the Universe. There's a level of heresy that I don't care to broach when comparing a Beatles song to the subsequent cover, but let me assure you...This is a solid rendition that is complemented perfectly by Wainwright's beautiful voice.<br /><br />Rufus has never been secretive about the fact that he began recording Poses to be a radio-friendly record. Rather than being a symbol of him selling out to the mainstream, it merely solidified his place as one of the most talented singer/songwriters alive. It's his most straight-forward record, with emphasis on his singing and songwriting ability rather than his penchant for overblown production and extravagant compositions. That's not a criticism of his later records, just a comment about this one. I love every record he has done, so to pick a singular favorite would be impossible for me.<br /><br />You may have noticed by how many times I've used the words \\"lovely\\" and \\"beautiful\\" that I adore Rufus Wainwright and his music. This review comes from a deeply-rooted bias, but it's hard to deny biased or not what a great record this is. Poses is his most subtle and (until his latest record [[ASIN:B006ZZANG0 Out of the Game]]) his most accessible album, but it's really terrific and a good starting point to allow yourself to bask in the beauty and brilliance of his music. If you've heard even one song you like by the man, this shouldn't disappoint you.

B004QOB8SO|5.0|I like this series a lot more than those Robert Downy, Jr. movies.  It does a better job striking a balance between being true to the original novels and yet making it accessible to a modern audience.<br /><br />For instance, both the RDJ movies and the new TV show are more face-paced and action-oriented than the original novels.  But the action in the movies is over-the-top and cartoonish.  The action in the TV show is more realistic.  (It's by no means entirely realistic and definitely has some fantastical elements.  It's certainly not like you're not watching \\"The Wire\\".  But relative to the movies, it's nearly not as cartoonish.)<br /><br />Also, in both the RDJ movies and the TV show the character of Holmes is a super genius who's egotistical and arrogant.  But the cockiness of RDJ's Holmes is somewhat whimsical and tongue-in-cheek.  It's like he's trying to be cool.  He's the class clown who is popular because of, not in spite of, his being an jerk.  The TV show Holmes is more of a straight-up jerk, a bit like the character of Dr. House in the TV show \\"House\\".<br /><br />The RDJ Holmes seems to be aware of social conventions, etiquette and courtesies, he just thinks they're stupid. He intentionally breaks them in protest or to get a reaction.  However, the TV show Holmes is mostly oblivious to social norms.  He violates them out of ignorance.  There's an Aspergian quality to him, like the character of Sheldon in The Big Bang Theory.<br /><br />Overall I'd say that, despite being set in modern London, the tone of the show is more on par with the books.<br /><br />Finally, the TV version of Moriarty is very original, fiendish, creepy and entertaining.  He reminds me of the Joker from \\"The Dark Knight\\".

B004132HZS|5.0|I like this TV series a lot more than those Robert Downy, Jr. movies.  It does a better job striking a balance between being true to the original novels and yet making it accessible to a modern audience.<br /><br />For instance, both the RDJ movies and the new TV show are more face-paced and action-oriented than the original novels.  But the action in the movies is over-the-top and cartoonish.  The action in the TV show is more realistic.  (It's by no means entirely realistic and definitely has some fantastical elements -- it's certainly not like you're not watching \\"The Wire\\".

044024630X|5.0|I've now read all Lee Child's \\"Jack Reacher\\" novels and, like everyone else, I've loved every one.  Actually right now I'm finishing the last one on the list, The Hard Way.  Over the past 12, or so, months I've ordered the books thru Amazon, of course, but have also picked-up some at my used-a-bit bookstores.  I printed a numerical listing so that I wouldn't re-purchase ones I'd already read. I was introduced to Jack Reacher by a bookstore owner, here in my town, while perusing the shelves.  Anyhow, getting back to Reacher - Child's has created a character of great integrity, someone who's incredibly smart and quite splendidly thinks outside the confines of a box. I've acquired a great deal of knowledge thru Mr. Child's well-crafted development of the character and the story.  My all-time favorite books are strong female and male role models and who's more at the top of that mountain than Reacher.  So, now I think I'll be having some withdrawal - because there's definitely not another Reacher in town.  When I first started the Reacher journey, I thought, \\"wouldn't the books make great movies\\" - so everyone could experience and benefit from such a role model - now I've decided it would be a disaster to put a \\"hollywood\\" face to Reacher.....yuck.  Wouldn't/couldn't do justice.  Where ever you start on your Reacher journey you will not be disappointed.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|I loved this trilogy. I couldn't put it down. It is so erotic and hot! I especially loved Book Two. All the women at my job are talking about these books. I'd like to see more books from Christian's point of view.
B007WV05GY|3.0|The basic problem of The Grey is the difference between what the filmmakers think they had and what the marketing department wanted to sell. This is promoted as a dramatic survival action movie in the trailers and even Liam Neeson's talk-show circuit tour pushed the same line - a plane crashes and a bunch of guys have to survive things that want to eat them. Kind of 'Alive' meets Jurassic Park. With Ra's al Ghul.<br /><br />Unfortunately, it's this difference that's going to disappoint most of the audience. The film starts with Liam's melancholic voice-over (which isn't a good sign) and a fairly dim setup of oil-riggers beating the ever-loving out of each other. We then see Liam shooting a wolf, lamenting the loss of his wife and then putting a rifle in his mouth and contemplating sparing us from another 2 hours of this. And it gets more depressing from there when the trip home ends abruptly in a plane crash.<br /><br />It's at this point that the film's indecision about what it is becomes a real problem. As an action or survival film, Liam guides his band of survivors in the most irresponsible way possible, making mistake after mistake and fundamentally dooming them all to becoming wolf entree. There are some basic errors, such as a stack of shotgun shells packed with his rifle, and anybody who's familiar with wolf behavior is going to be really unhappy at their depiction in this film. Anyone from Alaska is going to be even more unhappy at the depiction of swimming in rapids too.<br /><br />Also as an action film, the wolves have a supernatural capability to outsmart the survivors and behave more like Spielberg's raptors than any real life wolf. At one point they jump a ravine and the wolfs are waiting with GPS precision. They pick off our band of survivors one at a time, leaving us with intermittent testosterone-fueled in-fighting to pass as drama. If only Liam hadn't left the crash site, where rescue teams would already have arrived with burgers and cocoa.<br /><br />But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either. It's a psychological drama about facing death where the wolves act as furry metaphors for the grim reaper. From the very first scene to the last, Liam Neeson (who's very good as always) emphasizes this theme and it reverberates over and over. And that's where the film could have been quite good and a welcome break from the survival genre but unfortunately it's too late by the time it becomes clear that the wolves' uncanny supernatural sense has a very good explanation.<br /><br />My guess is that the everyone expecting an action drama is going to be very unhappy, along with animal rights, PETA, Alaskans and oil-riggers. It's a real shame they didn't recut the trailer before the release.br />But here's the problem - it's not an action film. It's not a survival film either.

B004MC8CA2|5.0|This is more than an app, it is a lift for every day and a teaching tool. It is a great app in its design and function, offering a number of ways to learn from God's Word and keep a fresh outlook for daily use. The variety of translations and devotional resources are nice, plus daily reminders are helpful. I like the fact that it will read aloud, nice on those mornimgs when I'm a bit sleepy or want to listen to God's Word while I work. Very stable application. Glad to have it and glad to use it!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|My husband brought the trilogy to my attention after hearing about them on the radio. One sample later I was hooked the first book enticed me the second book furthered me curiosity I was plainly hooked I read all the books as quickly as I could. I just had to know what happened next. The thrill of the mystery of a new relationship not really knowing where it would go. Adding the ups and downs of two lives crashing into each other in passion and aggression. Along with danger and wonder of someone causing harm to them. It was truely a never ending rush to read always getting a little more intwined in the fifty shades of gray. I loved it and longed for more each time. I still long for more.<br /><br />If your looking to get lost in someones world this one is worth getting lost in. Its realistic with out being over the top or harsh BDSM is a factor. Through out these books but not in a overly blunt way its so mild to the real point of the story that no one who likes mild erotica should turn away from these books. The story here is more deeply seeded in what its like for two very different people from different worlds to come togeather and work through baggage togeather. Its really what we all go through in a relationship but this book truely makes it a beautifully colored story.<br /><br />Thank you

B007J4T2G8|2.0|This book was on the Best Seller list so I purchased it, knowing  what the basic content would be. The story line was shallow, could easily skim without loosing any content. Bunch of simple words, simple content, a couple of sexual acts thrown in, and is supposed to be a literary work - NOT. Written like a child who had some knowledge of perverted sexual words & acts. Good authors, such as Lee Child, David Baldacci have much better story line with some occasional sex thrown in throughout the story, and you have a much better outcomes! Would not recommend this book.
0765324849|5.0|I haven't finished the book yet, so I'm just reviewing about the first 150 pages, and when I'm finished I'll come back and re-review it.<br /><br />For anyone who is a huge Bioshock fan, this is a must read. I LOVE this game series. One day I was curious if there was an app involving Bioshock on Android, so I searched \\"Bioshock\\" in the Google Play Store. Along with finding Bioshock apps I found that there was a book, so a bought it an Amazon. DO NOT BUY IT ANYWHERE ELSE! Before buying it on Amazon, I looked at it in some stores because I wanted i ASAP. Everywhere I looked it was $20-$30 and on here I got it for less than $10! Some reviews complained of there people multiple point of views, but these people are actaully wrong. Having multiple point of views means that one person is telling the story at one poin, and then someone else is narrating at another point. The whole story is in 3rd person. What people really mean that different people are concentrated on at some points. In a way It can be confusing, but it really isn't.<br /><br />So far I have read about Mr. Ryan deciding to finally build Rapture and why, the Time Rapture is being built, and the start of life in Rapture. Some of the characters I've read about that I recognize from the games are:<br />- Andrew Ryan<br />- Sullivan<br />- Dr. Suchong<br />. Brigid Tenenbaum<br />- Bill McDonagh (Major Character in the Book)<br />- Frank Fontaine<br />- Augustus Sinclair<br />- Simon Wales<br />- Stanley Poole<br />- Gilbert Alexander<br />- Sander Cohen<br />I know about other characters from the games, but I'm just telling you about the first 150 pages. There are also a lot more characters than I mentioned, but I can't recall them being in the games.<br /><br />Anyways the story is really good. I don't really like reading, but I have been reading his book in my free time sometimes.<br /><br />Spoiler Alert.... kind of.... sort of.... but not really.<br /><br />Sometimes cerain parts or characters seem pointless, but just keep reading and you'll realize why hose characters/parts were in he book.<br /><br />******* One more thing, and this is a MUST! Read this book with an open mind and don't read too much into the details. Some of these people who reviewed this book seemed too only accept their ideas of Rapture and the Bioshock character, and thought that was the TRUE way everything is. NO ONE knows the true ideas about everything in Bioshock, except for things that are clearly stated in the game (or if you go ask Ken Levine, the creator of Bioshock), so don't act like that otherwise you'll probably hate the book. People have different ideas and it's more intelligent to embrace those different ideas and make thing more interesting and give you more to think about. **********************************************ss, but just keep reading and you'll realize why hose characters/parts were in he book.<br /><br />******* One more thing, and this is a MUST!

B004GYY714|5.0|In late 2011, I had loaded an older version of TuneIn Radio onto my older, low end Android 2.3 tablet. Even back then, TuneIn had a simple interface and a great selection of music genres and talk programs. It ran smoothly on my low RAM device.<br /><br />Update Dec 2013: I now have an Android 4.04 Samsung phone and installed the newer version of TuneIn.<br /><br />What I love about this app is I don't have to log into any sort of account in order to use it. All I have to do is launch TuneIn and choose what I want to listen to - music or public radio (NPR, BBC news, local public radio programs).<br /><br />The newer version crashes on my new phone occasionally .. but it may be due to user issues, me switching around too much and too quickly for the program to catch up.<br /><br />Still my favorite Internet radio app. Highly recommended.
B00746O3X8|5.0|- Bought this the other day, I don't own but have coveted the Cotton Carrier for some time. Price of the latter has been the key obstacle.<br /><br />- I was amazed at the overall quality when I opened it up. For less than forty bucks I wasn't expecting much, and it totally exceeded those expectations.<br /><br />- Took quite some time to adjust fit. Still not sure it's optimal, would like the main plate to go more snugly against my chest. Will persevere. Agree with the other reviewer about fitment at the back of the neck, mine too is riding up and on a long event I would not be surprised if there'll be chafing on a bare neck.<br /><br />- The \\"mini screwdriver\\" that comes with it is excellent in my opinion. I used one of the (two supplied) \\"keyrings\\" and attached it to one of the hooks on the vest for permanent placement. Would hate to have had that thing loose and not be able to remove the lugs from each camera. Agree with the other reviewer on Cotton's Allen key approach, but does it have a hole for similar mounting to keep it with you at all times?<br /><br />- The lower part of the vest has a very handy pounch where you can store CF cards (or the mini screwdriver). It's small and flat, so don't expect to carry anything much thicker than a CF card.<br /><br />- I bought another harness at the same time --- http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00508ZURU --- that's worth looking at if you're considering this item. I much prefer the fit, which is perfect. Advantage of the Cotton and this item is for things like cycling/hiking where the main body is kept nicely snug against your chest. I'm keeping both! Highly recommended.<br /><br />I tested this item with:<br />- 7D and 24L no grip<br />- 5Dm2 and 70-200 2.8 IS with grip<br /><br />I recall the Cotton video talking about a special lug if you're using a grip. I found no problems at all with the lugs supplied with this item, both are the same height and they handle gripped/ungripped equally well, whereby the cameras stay where they should be and hang at a decent angle. I'm sure alternate lugs are optimal, but again, I found no issues with the ones in this kit.<br /><br />The 5Dm2 + 70-200 2.8 IS + grip results in a failry heavy weight, as you know, however I found it could comfortably hang on the side holster, no probs, in case I want to have the 400/5.6 in the main chest location.

B002VECMAE|5.0|I love Amazon in part for customer reviews. However! This is a good example why you shouldn't always trust them.<br /><br />This film is not just clever, well-acted, funny, amazing and (partly) true, it's also very touching. After all the laughs, if you're still paying attention, you'll find that there's a message about Life.

B007UXSPK2|4.0|Written by André Nemec and Josh Appelbaum, the story feels like a throwback to the days of Soviet spy-versus-spy intrigue and A-bomb secrets. This time, it all revolves around a briefcase with Russian launch codes that are prized by a brilliant Russian madman named Kurt Hendricks, code name Cobalt, who wants nothing less than using them to destroy the world. He is so feared that Hunt has to be sprung from a Russian prison where it is unclear why he is incarcerated until the very end of the film. A small IMF team has been assigned the duty, consisting of sultry but tough Jane Carter, tech wizard Benji Dunn, and unexpectedly, the IMF Secretary's chief analyst William Brandt. They need to track down a French assassin for hire who has already killed one of their own in cold blood for the briefcase. The team ends up in the Kremlin where their plans go fatally awry. The CIA points the finger at the IMF team for the disaster and invokes the dreaded Ghost Protocol.<br />DUN DUN DUN DAAA.

B003Y5HWMW|4.0|Spoilers to follow.<br /><br />I don't hate this series, but I don't particularly like it, either. If HBO cancels it right now, I won't be upset. If it runs for another 5 seasons, I'll watch. After struggling with these blu ray discs over the weekend, at this point I'm just in it for the LULZ. You have to laugh at the menu design, otherwise you'll throw the box set against the wall and cry.<br /><br />Short Version:<br />There was a flock of dragons, and a very badly designed blu ray menu. That's about it. If you'd like the details, read on.<br /><br />The Blu Ray Discs:<br />I don't know what the DVDs are like, but the blu rays make me mad as a hatter. I have seen complaints from many people who can't get them to load at all. I'm using a Sony BDP-S350 1080p Blu-ray Disc Player that I bought in 2009, and updated my firmware before I even bothered to insert a disc. They do take a very long time to load, but once they were loaded I didn't have problems beyond the confusing menus. Still, be prepared for potential problems.<br /><br />Frustration comes in with menus and having to constantly switch discs for bonus content. Whoever designed the menus, content and storage on these things should be trapped on a desert island with Joffrey Baratheon with no sunscreen. If you're in it just for the show, you should be fine. If you want to watch the extras, just know in advance that you are going to be as confused and frustrated as you are with the Cast of Thousands. Add to that about two dozen copyright notices that appear randomly in different languages after certain featurettes, and you may want to give the discs the same fate as Ned Stark.<br /><br />Some of the extras are on the discs where they say they are, and some of them are not. Let's say you want to watch episode one with commentary. It's on disc one with episode one. Same with episode two. Go to episode three, and it tells you to switch discs to watch episode three commentary. It does this throughout the set, sometimes sending you to the next disc, and sometimes sending you to the previous disc. After a certain point, you've forgotten where you were and you have to stop and figure out what episode you were on, and you wonder whether it's worth getting up 8 times just to get the extras.<br /><br />I was hoping the commentary would give me some more insight into what was going on in the show, but this sadly didn't pan out. The first episode with David Benioff and Dan Weiss does exactly what I wanted. There's another one with one of the directors giving good information, but the rest of the commentary really didn't contribute much. Or maybe I was just too frustrated with the menu to care at that point. Lena Heady pointed out something about Cersei's relationship with Sansa Stark that had not occurred to me, but that's the only useful thing I got out of it.<br /><br />A lot of the featurettes have been available on You Tube on HBO's own channel since the beginning of the series. Still, there are ones I have never seen and found quite interesting, like the making of the opening of the show, so you may find some great content here--if you can find the right disc. So the extra features are quite the mixed bag.<br /><br />Season One:<br />This is a pretty good series, but it's got problems. It's supposed to be high fantasy, but it comes across as more alternate history. I think the rule for fantasy writers these days is to use as little magic as possible, but this series has been stripped of too much. The only hint of magic or otherworldliness comes at the end of the series with the appearance of the dragons. To make up for the lack of magic, they throw in a bunch of \\"gritty\\" stuff to make it more \\"real,\\" and I do mean they throw in everything--rape, incest, prostitution, graphic violence, and a potpourri of other disturbing images and events.<br /><br />Game of Thrones has way too much expository dialogue. It gets bogged down with characters talking about stuff that happened off screen years ago. Most of the time this is done to establish character, even though we already know what the character is like. We may even already know the story and it ends up being a repeat. They just keep talking and talking and will not shut up. Just when you think something is going to happen, someone launches into a long speech about some past traumatic event. Even Tyrion does this, and it's agonizingly long.<br /><br />They even do this during the quintessential HBO sex scenes, which themselves get way out of hand. I know this is HBO, and it's going to be graphic, but there's a point where it turns into bad soft porn and contributes absolutely nothing to story, character or anything else. I know this is why some people tune in, I know some of it is expected, I'm not a prude... it's just that the show takes it beyond the usual levels of absurdity.<br /><br />Then, there are loads and loads of characters--mostly because they keep getting killed off. This is one of those shows where anyone can die. What makes it irritating is that this often comes shortly after we've been told the character's life history and we actually start to care. A lot of times the information turns out to be unimportant, and you wish they had spent the time showing something else... anything else.<br /><br />You literally need to take notes to keep up with what's going on with so many plots and points of view. It's hard to remember all the names and relations. For example, The Lord Commander of the Night's Watch is father to Jorah Mormont. Jorah is the Wikipedia of Westeros who runs around with the Targaryen/Dothraki bunch in the Free Cities, doing a LOT of exposition along the way.<br /><br />Jorah was the one sending information about the Targaryens to the king, which is why he got a royal pardon for selling slaves. He is the one who disgraced the commander, and that's why the commander gave his heirloom sword to Jon Snow. It's hard to follow that in the series because there is so much other stuff going on. You have to watch it 2 or 3 times to get everything out of it. I had to go looking around fan web sites to figure out what was happening sometimes. The show is full of situations like this.<br /><br />In turn, the series progresses very slowly until Ned Stark's pivotal execution scene. The plot moves at the speed of smell until that point, then suddenly you've got battles, kings, hostages and negotiations all over the place. It's just as confusing at the faster pace, if not more so.<br /><br />Ultimately, the characters are the reason I stuck with the series. Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Tyrion Lannister is priceless as the highly intelligent snark knight. He's the only comedy relief in an otherwise exceptionally miserable world. At times I am just waiting for Tyrion to appear on screen and the other stuff is just time filler.<br /><br />Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen was gone too soon, but what a spectacular exit! Fortunately Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon has stepped in as an entertaining character everyone can love to hate. Neither seems to have any redeeming qualities. I prefer my villains to have some bit of grey or good part to them, and I wish they would show more of Joffrey's human side.<br /><br />Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark is also one of my favorites, but most fans tend to not like her. I think it comes from Sansa's genre blindness and naivety. This changes, and I think it is interesting to see how someone who thinks the world works like fairy tales adjusts to a world as grim as this.<br /><br />I'm rating this series and blu ray set as four stars because I think most people will enjoy the main content. I'm not a huge fan, but I think almost everyone else would do well to give it a try. With so many characters and plots, most people are bound to find some part of the series they will want to follow. You're just going to have a difficult time of it if you want to enjoy the extra features.en years ago.

Peter Dinklage as the dwarf Tyrion Lannister is priceless as the highly intelligent snark knight. He's the only comedy relief in an otherwise exceptionally miserable world. At times I am just waiting for Tyrion to appear on screen and the other stuff is just time filler.<br /><br />Harry Lloyd as Viserys Targaryen was gone too soon, but what a spectacular exit! Fortunately Jack Gleeson as Joffrey Baratheon has stepped in as an entertaining character everyone can love to hate. Neither seems to have any redeeming qualities. I prefer my villains to have some bit of grey or good part to them, and I wish they would show more of Joffrey's human side.<br /><br />Sophie Turner as Sansa Stark is also one of my favorites, but most fans tend to not like her. I think it comes from Sansa's genre blindness and naivety. This changes, and I think it is interesting to see how someone who thinks the world works like fairy tales adjusts to a world as grim as this.<br /><br />I'm rating this series and blu ray set as four stars because I think most people will enjoy the main content. I'm not a huge fan, but I think almost everyone else would do well to give it a try. With so many characters and plots, most people are bound to find some part of the series they will want to follow. You're just going to have a difficult time of it if you want to enjoy the extra features.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I was just randomly looking for a book on my kindle and stumbled across this one due to its great reviews so I downloaded it. Just finished #5today and loved the entire series. I saw today it is becoming a movie which it totally deserves. This is a great read for anyone!
1451648537|4.0|I bought this when it first came out and I was hesitant to read it since I sometimes find biographies to be a bit boring. However, I thoroughly enjoyed this one. It could be that I knew a good amount of the story, but I liked getting the extra details I haven't gotten from following things about Jobs. I also enjoyed hearing the other side of the latter product stuff from when I started following (and liking) Apple products.<br /><br />I was surprised by the common theme of how awful Jobs could be, but I guess if that was who he was, then so be it. I cannot say it was well balanced or not since I have nothing to compare it to (primary source or otherwise). It certainly didn't put him in the best light so that says something. I think the author says it right when he says in the intro that it is for the reader to decide if he was fair or not.<br /><br />For anyone who cares about the tech world as it is today, whether they like Apple or not, I would recommend reading this book.
B007J4T2G8|2.0|[[ASIN:0345803485 Fifty Shades of Grey: Book One of the Fifty Shades Trilogy]]<br />  I do not know why I kept reading this book.  I wanted Ana out of that relationship from the very beginning. I am a counselor for relationships & I see a lot of this.  Never quite this extreme. I guess the romantic in me wanted to see her turn him to the loving side.  I was gratified at the end...but still saddened at all she went through believing she could change. I will not read the rest of the trilogy.
B003VANOFY|1.0|I purchase this headset a few months ago and after two months of use, I noticed a crack in the plastic area where there are screws at, which eventually broke into pieces.  Logitech did give me a replacement and after another two months of use, the exact same problem on the other side.  It seems the plastic they used was cheap Chinese plastic that is not durable at all.  The sound quality is great and the voice boom mic works great as well.  If only it was durable and made to last.  I can't understand why the reviewers gave it good reviews, apparently they didn't use it long enough...
B007ZD17XO|3.0|I like the game but I don't play it because it kills any other sound apps and that's just unacceptable.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book is very interesting and captivating.i hated to put it down because it is so good.while reading this adventurous story i could imagine myself in this perticular  situation.it was a fresh idea for the future of a country that destroyed itself in the past and left itself with a cruel new world.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|this app is great, I use it to take notes in class all the time and I love it.  its the best note taking app ive tried so far
B0063IH60K|4.0|This game worked well on my Kindle Fire. Easy to move cards around. I enjoy playing this very<br />much. The tips don't help help much though.
0786958731|5.0|I won't attempt to review this game in total, or go over the rules, as this has been done effectively many times before. I wanted to review it, however, as an experience for playing with young children.<br /><br />Summary - 5/5<br /><br />I have 2 kids, one 4 one 6.5. This game is excellent for introducing children 6+ to gaming concepts, and enjoying some quality time together. I would not recommend it as a first game, but once your kids have some basic ideas of gameplay, its cooperative nature offers a perfect blend of progressively independent action and bonding.<br /><br />Theme and appeal - 5/5<br /><br />The theme and appeal of the game is obvious. By the age of 3 or 4 most children will have been bombarded with a variety of fantasy narratives, and enjoy them. Spooky dungeons. Scary dragons. Heroic knights. While some parents may be concerned at the idea of crawling through caves and killing monsters, my personal view is that this comes very naturally to kids these days, and is in fact quite empowering - see a monster, whammo! blast it with a magic wand.<br /><br />This game creates a very tactile upfront experience of the things they have seen on TV or in story books. The little miniatures are very appealing, both to my 3 (almost 4) year old girl, and to my 6.5 year old son.<br /><br />Is it kid proof - 3/5<br /><br />This game is sturdy and durable. You will, however, need to keep a close eye on all the bits, which can be easily lost if not kept in themed baggies, and without very clear 'putting away when used' rules.<br /><br />The miniatures can probably take some abuse, but also need some care as there are bits that could be snapped off. You will also need to be disciplined with the cards. When my son gets excited, he waves his arms and is sometimes tempted to squish them inside his hands.<br /><br />Assuming you play on the floor (which I do) you may also need to make clear no walking or rolling over the board rules...<br /><br />Can a 6/7 year old contribute meaningfully, and feel fulfilled? - 4/5<br /><br />Most certainly, but with guidance. Even a three year old can choose which corner of a new tile to explore, and count out spaces (although it helps if they have learned space counting in other games first). A 6/7 year old can choose which powers they want to use, although may need some tactical/strategic guidance.<br /><br />I found the game offered plenty to make my son feel very fulfilled playing the game. We died in our first adventure, but despite this setback he was delighted to recall some of his more heroic moments, and how if we had only done this or that we might just have made it.<br /><br />Can Dad enjoy it while playing with the kids? - 5/5<br /><br />Certainly he can. One way to view it is as solo plus, in which you still may have to make a majority of the strategic decisions - which (despite some complaints about the game being too easy) are not always simple - but you also get the pleasure in sharing the experience with others.<br /><br />You can also use the game to practice your story telling skills to a sometimes quite demanding audience!<br /><br />Is it educational? - 5/5<br /><br />OK, let's be clear up front that this is not going to enhance your child's understanding of world geography, or the way plants grow. It is fantasy.<br /><br />But first up, I consider fantasy to be an important part of human culture, and one of the shared experiences that bind society together.<br /><br />Beyond that, the game teaches social play. Teamwork. Tactical and strategic decision making. Logic. (If-then, if not-then something else). Basic AI. Planning. It encourages reading, and thinking about maths and probability. It teaches rule systems, and how to best use them to your advantage. What's not to love about this, especially in an era of electronic solitude?<br /><br />Is it easy to learn/teach? - 4/5<br /><br />Again, this puts a certain amount of onus on the parent. I highly doubt your 6.5 year old willbe able to read and understand the rules without guidance.<br /><br />I made the mistake of trying a first game without understanding everything myself, and my poor son was stuck watching me sweat my way through the rules (as can be seen from another posting I made). It might be a good idea to do a solo run first.<br /><br />But once you get the basic concepts (how monsters move!), it comes quite easily. Yes, you do need to explain how the powers work. How the exploration works. How the monsters work. It is a lot to absorb at first.<br /><br />But if your kid is interested, they will pay attention, and it can be revealed progressively through gameplay.<br /><br />I am also amazed how much space a 6/7 year old has in his/her brain to absorb new rules... more than once I've opened an old card game and asked - hmm, how many do we deal to start? - only to have my son answer for me...<br /><br />Does it play out reasonably quickly? - 4/5<br /><br />I am assuming, with this score, that you know that you are in for a substantial game. i.e. This is not a ten minute frisson. The question is whether it can keep a kid's attention or not.<br /><br />In my first game, I found myself wishing it would take a little less time. Not a lot less, but right at the end - when it went past bedtime, and was starting to drag a little.<br /><br />That said, the denouement came roughly about the time I expected, and my son's attention was pretty gripped (allowing for a couple of short breaks). And there would be no harm in tweaking the game a bit... one or two fewer tiles, perhaps, before the final boss, could be one approach.<br /><br />Is it fun? - 5/5<br /><br />Yes! Its theme, fairly simple gameplay, and balance of achievement and challenge works well for kids. Everyone loves receiving a treasure. Everyone hates getting a nasty encounter.<br /><br />Great game. And given it is a system more than a game, with a lot of variety, I hope to be playing this for quite some time.
B000UOOT1W|5.0|I will disagree with some other reviewers and argue this album is exactly what it says it is. The tracks are probably all top 10 hits and if there were some statistics available, these would be Santana's top selling songs. So they are the ultimate popular Santana tracks and therefore the title seems perfectly qualified. Ironically perhaps, Santana had his/their greatest success in the comeback period. The highly critically acclaimed albums from the 70s, such as Caravanserai, were a completely different kind of beast. Their atmospheric sound would be lost in a collection of top hits - it makes no sense to expect any of that music in an anthology. The same goes for their live performances.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|great game cant get enough my girls and I love playing it we could do it for hours my husband is Always telling us /to quit
B000VWYNNW|4.0|The remastered version has superior quality over the original - no question.  But the use of the film soundtrack instead of the original soundtrack is so obvious it is apparent they are either blended from separate performances or they are (as I have read elsewhere) different performances altogether. Also the edits are a bit confronting for those of us who know the original release note for note.<br />\\"No Quarter\\" for example had a mighty John Bonham crash of his gong that was accompanied by a deep bass bash....well the bass and the crash are somewhat diminished in the new release. Some songs have parts \\"missing\\" and because these are not identical tracks, Robert Plants vocals are not always hitting the same notes.<br />In spite of all this I do love it: it's just not 100% of what it could have been.
B000002VRZ|5.0|Like so many bands lumped into the \\"Southern Rock\\" category, the Outlaws never got proper respect from critics and the rock establisment. Another strike against them was that they also happened to arrive on the music scene around the same time as another popular Florida band: Lynyrd Skynyrd. So, yeah, they played for years under the shadow of more popular and more established bands like Skynyrd, and of course the Allman Brothers, and even regional acts like the Marshall Tucker Band, Wet Willie, and the Charlie Daniels Band. But the Outlaws DID have their own sound, as another reviewer noted, combining intricate guitar solos with melodic songs and soaring harmonies. Hard to resist music that was this good. And this \\"Best of\\" compiliation is an excellent one, packed with their finest tunes. You could nitpick about some of the exclusions (all the more reason for a proper 2-CD retrospective, in my opinion; the band really deserves a more comprehensive collection), but what's here is very good indeed. This will certainly appeal to fans of Southern Rock, Country Rock, or anyone who enjoys rock and pop that has style and energy.
B0073PZIBQ|3.0|When my grandchildren came to visit they insisted that I would \\"love, love\\" this movie.  They had already seen it several times and wanted me to watch it again with them. It had a positive theme but I did not enjoy it nearly as much as they did on their third viewing.
B004W2UBYW|5.0|An absolutely fascinating story about a complex genious who changed the world with his views on personal technological consumer products.  Isaacson has hit a homerun with this contemporary biography.

B007IXWKUK|5.0|i am not a romantic by nature, but there is something about these books that just grab me, i guess it is you are reading about people who actually fight in life. do i believe people really have sex like this all the time no, i realize the book is purely fictional.  when i fiinshed the series, i felt like i wouldn't be reading about my best friends anymore.  it is the weirdest thing, i don't like romance novels and usually read different type of novels, but i liked these books.  I have actually read the 2nd book twice.
B008469DGY|5.0|it is so addictive and fun. I give it five stars easy. great way to pass time.... thank you for the fun
B0026P40NU|3.0|A next-to-last century British version of Montmartre's bohemia while ambitious young artists climbed it up the Olympus, drama, lust, sex, suicide presented.<br /><br />A vital necessity for a well-hilled pushing protector is a very fresh contemporary line for viewing this of-visual-art historic work, surely.
B006WB7IN8|5.0|Wow...a fantastic read, definately wasn't what I expected. I couldn't put it down once I started. Really well written, brilliant storyline..
B002PEP4SC|4.0|As a fan of the television series Castle, it is impossible not to know the Nikki Heat books exist.  However, I really did not know what to expect when I started reading Heat Wave.  I found out that it is a pleasant mirror of the television series itself.  The main characters names have been changed and the book is written with what one would imagine would be the style of Richard Castle.<br /><br />  As any fan knows, Richard Castle is one of the main characters of the television show.  So who is the true author?  Neither ABC, nor Amazon is telling.  Look up the author and you see a picture of the real life Nathan Fillion with \\"Richard Castle\\" written adjacent to it.  This is rather cute and in my opinion does add to the allure of the book itself.<br /><br />  I did like the book, hence the four star rating.  It is a pretty slow read for the first half but picks up nicely and finishes well.  So please don't start it then give up on it.  I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys the television series and I do plan on reading the remaining Nikki Heat books at some point in the future.
B002BSHWUU|5.0|Simply a perfect gift for us who love and appreciate the good music and the poetry of the best rock n' roll quartet ever!<br /><br />The box comes with 14 paper cases for 16 audio cds, imitating the original LP cases. It also constains a dvd with 13 mini documentaries about each of the LPs the band has recorded. You can also find these mini documentaries in each of the cds if you play them on your computer.<br /><br />As I said, it's a collector's item. It contains each and every song gound in the Blue and Red albums and in the 1-Beatles cd. It is a total of 226 songs.<br /><br />If you like The Beatles as much as everyone that knows them like, I wouldn't waste any other second. It is simply totaly worthy!
045122499X|5.0|Pillars Of The Earth was fabulous. An easy read, great story line and lots of history to learn about on the way through it.  World Without End is its sequel and is just as enjoyable.  I'll be sorry when I through reading it.
0345803485|1.0|Oh, the hype made this sound intriguing - a novel with a blend of naughty, hot sex and romance.  I was looking forward to a good love story with steamy erotica, but instead I got some iffy quality writing, strange sex, and a lot of repetition.  Right from the start, I found that the protagonist is too pure, too pretty, too naive, and then too accepting.  Her love interest, entrepreneur Christian Grey, is too handsome, too rich, too philanthropic, too kinky, too demanding, and not likable.  Here is a quick summary to illustrate the repetition: she blushes, bites her lip, blushes and bites and blushes and bites, and has major orgasms with vaginal sex.  She goes from zero to sixty: a virgin and had never touched herself to bondage, with more orgasms, more blushing.  He desires her, wants to beat her, literally, and wants to dominate her.  He especially wants her when she bites her lip.  Oh, how I wanted her to stop biting that lip!  Toward the end of the book, we find out he is troubled - no kidding.<br /><br />I'm middle-aged, so at first I though this wasn't working for me because the characters are both in their twenties, and maybe were not relatable. Or, perhaps, I just couldn't appreciate dominance/submission and sadomasochism.  But that wasn't really it.  It's that the author painted these characters with a juvenile brush.  He's a teenaged fantasy:  he's not just rich; he's a billionaire, with helicopters and jets and personal staff.  She's also a teenaged fantasy: she's not just pretty; she's gorgeous, smart, and unknowingly sexy.  The sex isn't very hot and there is no romance.  My advice to both young adults and adults would be to skip this one.  It's inappropriate for the first group and distasteful to the latter.
0345803485|5.0|Very interesting subject matter....with a good story line and leaves you wanting to read the next Fifty Shades Darker. Have started Fifty Sahdes Darker and can't put it down.
B003O86FMW|4.0|This book is a great sequel...it definitely makes you want to read the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy.
0061900656|5.0|I love reading this book each day with my 19 mos old, who will be a big brother in 4 more months. I ask him to point to the baby and he excitedly says \\"ight dere.\\"  Then we do the same thing for the big brother.  I've noticed he starts to point out babies when we go out now, so hopefully he'll get use to the idea.<br /><br />I love that the book talks about what you can and can't do with babies and what makes being the big brother special.  It will be a gentle reminder once baby is around.<br /><br />Very satisfied with my purchase, and would recommend it to anyone.
B001KVZ6HK|4.0|Rating:<br />+4 The dust still hasn't settled on the excitement of the release of The Avengers.  Joss Whedon was handed over the combined stories of four of Marvel's most iconic characters (and a few others tossed in for good measure) and asked to create a film (co-written with Zak Penn) that brought all of them together on a scale that has, at least up until this point, never been achieved.  For the most part, Whedon and company do a pretty darned good job of things.<br /><br />I've seen the film three times so far and I might actually go check it out one more time before it leaves theaters.  I saw it in 2D the first and last time and in 3D the second time.  While the 3D looks decent enough, it's only necessary for a couple of \\"epic\\" looking moments in the film.  Otherwise, the 3D adds nothing to the story.....not that it needs to add anything.<br /><br />The story itself moves at a pretty fast pace and is an excellent collection of action and plot.  While Whedon could have easily taken a ride on the Michael Bay train of excessive 'splosions and computer-generated \\"awesome,\\" he instead scattered the action throughout a very solid plot that builds on the unique personalities of the four main players (Captain America, Thor, Iron Man, and Hulk) and how they eventually come together to take on Thor's lil' adopted brother, Loki, in a war to save the planet.<br /><br />The story begins with Loki coming to Earth to acquire the Tesseract (which you are familiar with if you've seen some of the other films leading up to this, specifically Thor and Captain America).  Once it is in his control, he plans to use an army (I'll remain a bit vague here for the two people who haven't seen this film) to take over Earth and then any other world he sees fit to conquer after that.  In his way, however, is Nick Fury and S.H.I.E.L.D.  Fury sets out to gather three of Earth's mightiest heroes.  He sends Agent Coulson to find Tony Stark (Iron Man), Agent Romanoff/Black Widow to fetch Dr. Banner (Hulk), and he calls upon Captain America himself.  A fourth hero, Thor, is considered a wild card and there is no way to know if he'll even show up to help battle his little brother.<br /><br />When Loki shows up, he \\"compromises\\" Agent Barton/Hawkeye and Dr. Selvig, making them his servants.  He takes the Tesseract and sets out on his plan of world domination.<br /><br />Can Fury convince Cap, Iron Man, and Hulk to join forces against Loki?  Will Thor show up?  Can Scarlett Johansson look any hotter in this film?  You'll have to see The Avengers to find out.<br /><br />The cast is brilliant from top to bottom.  I was always fond of Tom Hiddleston's performance as Loki in Thor, and he amps it up just a bit for this film.  He's a bit more psychotic and a lot more egotistical in this go round.  Chris Evans IS Captain America.  I believed every single word that came out of his mouth as he not only took the point during the fight, but let his true blue all American ways come through.  He was a man lost in time who injected just the right amount of old fashioned American patriotism to save the day.  Robert Downey Jr. could have played the role of Iron Man in his sleep in this third outing as Tony Stark, but instead he played the funny man to Evans' straight man in this film.  All of the characters had their funny moments, but Downey seemed to be written into the film primarily for humor.  Don't get me wrong, Iron Man has plenty of epic moments in this film, but most of the laughs come from him, except for the big green guy......Hulk.  Mark Ruffalo stepped into the much maligned role of Bruce Banner, and made it his own.  He's meek, desperate to remain calm, and always warning others not to cross him.  He and Stark have a few funny moments together, but let's be honest here, we all came to see the Hulk do what he does best, which is SMASH, and he does just that to perfection once he's unleashed in the film.  Not only does Hulk have some of the most brutal moments inthis film, he has two of the funniest ones as well.  I won't spoil them for you here, but don't be surprised when you laugh out loud during a tense confrontation between the Hulk and another character.  Chris Hemsworth, much like Evans, was made for the role of Thor.  He has some of the top action moments in this film, but also handles the emotional struggle of fighting against or saving his brother quite well.<br /><br />Samuel Jackson does a solid job as Nick Fury, although his character is delegated more to a background role as he does most of his fighting against S.H.I.E.L.D. itself.  Cobie Smulders, while nice on the eyes, was pretty much vanilla as Agent Maria Hill.  Scarlett Johansson was very good as Black Widow and handled her action sequences quite well.  Jeremy Renner did a good job in the role of Clint Barton/Hawkeye.  His role was a bit limited, but he owns every minute he's on the screen.<br /><br />The real gem in this film was Clark Gregg as Agent Coulson.  His giddy fanboy reaction to Captain America was classic, and despite being a relatively small player in all of the other films, he takes center stage this time around.<br /><br />The action was very good.  It was also very loud and very fast.  Whedon loved to zoom in a lot, which led up to a number of blurry fight sequences, especially involving Hulk, Thor, and Iron Man.  He made sure that there were plenty of iconic scenes during the film, one of the best involving Captain America and Thor.  He also did a fair job of pacing with the film.<br /><br />The only knock that I really have with this movie is that some of the editing was choppy.  One particularly epic sequence involving three heroes ended with a thud, and took me out of the film for just a split second.  There were also a few scenes involving Loki's army that reminded me of the old television series V from the 1980's, and amped up the cheese a tad bit.<br /><br />Still, the fanboy in me wants to give this film five stars for the simple fact that it was pulled off.  It was fun, epic, and brilliant.  However, the amateur critic within begs me to take off one star for the fact that the editing did really bother me a couple of times.<br /><br />So is it worth multiple viewings?  Considering the fact that it's the only film I've ever paid full price to see more than once at the theater, yes, it's definitely worth multiple viewings.  I plan to own it on DVD when it comes out (September 25 is the announced date).  It's popcorn fodder with a plot, and that's a rare treat, especially during the \\"blockbuster\\" summer season for Hollywood.<br /><br />Go see this film.  Go see this film.

B007BVOF8E|4.0|If you read through several of these reviews, you'll know if this is a film for you or not. It's a very well-acted, quality production of a cerebral story. It's more of a \\"detective\\" film than a spy film. Leads are followed up, conversations had. It will keep you guessing. There are a few parts that are confusing, but overall a very enjoyable film if you like this type of movie.
B003MC5N28|1.0|This book makes a feeble attempt at demonstrating what a \\"utopian\\" society would look like. There is somewhat of a build-up for the main character to break free and for the community to become enlightened, but gaps in the story and the failure the close loops make the book a sore disappointment.
B005LAIGSM|5.0|Great movie, get a rental plus digital copy from another website with DVD, what else could you want.  Very pleased
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I loved this book i thought it was great that there was a strong willed female lead charector for once.That isnt a whiny weak charactor. I think the development of the story between her a petta was amazing and i was read this book over and over again though the years.

0345803485|1.0|I couldn't help but laugh at many of the reviews, either criticizing the delightful repetitive word count, or the one aimed at the non-authors. Please. This is FAN FICTION! Most certaintly not a trilogy. And a horribly written fanfiction at that. In a span of six months, Bella err I mean Ana, falls for Edward, gets sexually harassed at work, stifles a child molester, almost dies at the hands of an ex, gets married, parties and gets in trouble, watches her dad fight for his life, single handedly saves her sister in law from a crazed man with a vendetta, when her husband and his billions and his extensive security couldn't, gets pregnant, and ends happily ever after, saving her husband, Edward or whatever the author decided to call him, from his tormented, sexually depraved lifestyle. The book reads like a long run-on sentence, with absolutely no character development and whose only real conflict is the one between Ana and her \\"inner goddess.\\" Save yourself the money and do a search for the orignial fanfiction, Masters of the Universe.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I have not read anything like this book for a number of years.  Some parts moved very fast other parts were slow. Author writes well but was very grafic which took away from book at times.  There was more sex then actual story content which was OK but would not want a steady diet of this kind of writings.
1451627289|5.0|My wife has read almost everything Stephen King has written and I've read a lot less than she has...I often make jokes about the fact that he is another writer that churns material out whether it's good or not.  For example, I was less than impressed with \\"The Dome\\" because I felt the ending was lacking (it just...ended!).  However, I found this book covered all the bases, neatly tied up loose ends, and though long, was a good read.  The last line in the book was inspired.  All in all, I thought this one of the best pieces of literature he's put out in a quite a while.  And, man, he nailed Lisbon Falls right on the head...
B002GHIPYI|4.0|These headphones feel a bit cheap and plastic when you first handle them.  They're actually built fairly well but that's the first impression you get when handling them. The sound insulation from outside noises is not great.  If you need sound isolation another product would be a better choice for you.  They are quite comfortable to wear for extended periods of time.<br /><br />The sound is very, very good for the price! I would say they outperform a number of other expensive products by the likes of Sennheiser, etc...<br /><br />I primary use these with an Objective2 (O2) amp I built.
B00846F1YW|2.0|I put the glass picture together but nothing happens.  I can't go any further in the game!!  What do I do now?  Help.
0385342039|4.0|this book is seriously hysterical, there were times that i couldn't help laughing out loud on the bus or train cause it was so funny. the reason i gave it four stars is because *SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!* i didn't really like her great aunt all the time. she seemed a little bit too bossy and annoying. also at the end i feel like they made too big a deal trying to bring her fame by publicizing her painting and so on. it just went on and on about how important it was too her and i guess it was a little bit annoying. but other than that, great and funny book, and i thought it was a really good plot as well.
B0064X7FVE|3.0|I like this app I got it on my ipod and it worked fine but now when I check on my kindle fire half the time the Internet is lost. its not horrible though I say get it if you want its the good weather app
B003O86FMW|5.0|all three books of the Hunger Games were absolutely GREAT.  I surley hope to see more of the same type from this author.
B006QKJQ12|5.0|It was just as entertaining as the previous movie. Left you with the sense that their might be a Kung Fu Panda 3??
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I enjoyed this app greatly. It is a cute little collection. Points are easy to earn. Prices are not that bad if you anat to buy points. :)
B004P8JPS6|4.0|another good read about reacher- also liked the free preview with it--was pretty cool how this book kinda goes into Reacher's backstory and why he left the Army-
0307951529|4.0|Chris has a great talent for laying out his ideas in accessible, clear and simple terms - with humor, compassion, and just the right amount of butt-kicking. As I've followed him over the past 5 years his writing has become more eloquent and succinct all the time. The guy really practices what he preaches too - a testament of integrity. I met him on his first book tour and was tremendously impressed with how he connects individually with people.<br /><br />Though this book isn't the first \\"product\\" I've bought from him, it definitely tipped me to start writing out my Grand Plan. I've been mulling over how to put the Plan together for several years, and then one evening after reading the book I woke up with the whole thing. Bam.<br /><br />If you're looking to get started with your idea - the one that's been kicking around in your head for more than a year - this is the book to get you moving forward. Get ready to change your life, because this read is going to open your mind to endless possibilities.
B0036S4C6G|2.0|Moving around in time can serve a constructive purpose but, in this case, just seemed contrived.  Very difficult read with no real reward.
0345803485|5.0|I have nothing to say about this book but the best - I literally could not put it down.  It touched me so deeply and the ending made me run out and buy the second book right away.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|Honestly, this book IS poorly written, repetitive, and predictable.  However, we're not reading it because it's classic literature, right?  This book was definitely the best of the three and it was fun to read :).
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This trilogy was one that I'll never forget. It is a MUST.. All of my friends and neighbors are reading as well!!
B007IXWKUK|3.0|After the first book being so repetitive, this one was almost painful to read, but it was still interesting and I was still interested in the characters.  Predictable but fine.
B007FH9GT2|5.0|This movie was worth the wait. Daniel Craig is a very good actor. This movie sparked my interest in the trilogy. Streaming movies through Amazon.com is so convenient.
B007IXWL2C|2.0|This book was just plain bad.  I knew it would be awful after reading the first two (I enjoyed the first one and tolerated the second one), but I felt obligated to finish the trilogy.  The author just seemed to throw every problem that she could think of into this novel in an attempt to finish the series with a bang, but it was not good.  Also, it was annoying that the title gave away the ending (even though I knew how it would end).
B007MJSQSK|4.0|I often stream movies from Amazon.com. As usual, the picture was flawless, the audio was crisp and clear, and there was enough time to rewatch the movie. I really enjoy Amazon.com movies. And they are reasonably priced.
0307951529|5.0|I've been following Chris Guillebeau and his \\"Art of Non-Conformity\\" for a while, so I was very interested in how he was going to compile all \\"the learnings\\" into this book. What I found is that while reading the book, I was writing down notes on my own \\"$100 startup\\" idea. As America's International Travel Expert®, I've been asked for travel advice by more than just a few people; most I knew personally, but some were complete unknowns. I was giving away all this information for Free!<br /><br />Chris's book gave me clarity as I was trying to determine how to leverage my knowledge and abilities into a business that would not only help travelers, but also provide me with a source of income to support my own travels. The early-on definition of Convergence (where your passion meets with what others want and will pay for) helped me focus on what I would do. Creating the killer offer, and ways to tweak your business to make it better (help more people, add more income, etc.) led me to a multiple-tier pricing model.<br /><br />The best piece of advice, however, was to focus on the BENEFIT that I was offering; not the Features. After all, customers buy for their own benefit -- think in terms of how they make a purchase.<br /><br />I do have an MBA from a top-rated university, but \\"The $100 Startup\\" gave me the roadmap I needed to properly define my new business and how I can help others get more enjoyment from their travels. Thanks, Chris, for this clarity!
B000002MUN|5.0|First of all, I LOVE this album. I love every song on it. You Dont Know How It Feels made me want to pick the harmonica back up and play again after years of messing around with it. I feel that this is Tom at his best. Many on here do not think so, thats ok. You all are entitled to your opinions, but as for me, I love this album from start to finish. I turned a friend on to this one, and had to buy myself another copy. I did not mind. I love to turn people on to great music.
B007V2UGPE|5.0|its a cool game my kids enjoy it very much ...wished it had a little more story maybe a quest or some mini games I'd pay to play that.
0307594165|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed Toni Morrison's latest novel (novella?) \\"Home\\" and the highest praise I can give it is a twist on \\"praise\\" she's been given for some of her other novels. That is, that \\"Home\\" is NOT reminiscent of Faulkner. That's praise in my opinion. (I know, I know, lots of people love him. I don't)<br /><br />Morrison has been called Faulknerian in the past because her prose style has been often disjoint and cryptic. Many times it takes a few paragraphs or pages to figure out where you are in her novels. That is what makes me dislike Faulkner (try the first page of \\"The Sound and the Fury\\") but I accepted it in Morrison because she was better at it; eventually you found your place and her characters were worth the try.<br /><br />\\"Home\\" is a pretty straight-forward narrative with the addition of a wonderful little conceit where the main character, Frank, addresses the author directly. The book also contains a collection of vignettes about the secondary characters (Lily, Leonor) whereby Morrison shows us more about a character in a few pages than many authors can in a whole book. Morrison is a Nobel Laureate and Pulitzer Prize winner for a reason.<br /><br />The plot: Frank, with Korean war PTSD, is on a mission to save his sister, Cee - from what I don't want to spoil, but trust me, it's bad. It's a simple but elegant plot and there is a confession that both twists things up and clears things up, toward the end. It's a fast read but a thoroughly enjoyable one.
0545091020|5.0|I had so much fun listening to the Hunger Games on cd as i drove home from college. The narrator does a good job, and having the story on 9 discs made it easy to manage. Very good book- made me hunger for the next one!
B0083B3KOQ|5.0|My kids have iphones and send videos of my grandson in mov format. I haven't been able to play them on my Samsung Galaxy tab until now. This program converts them quick and easy!
B0015DROBO|2.0|Every single riddle of this detective styled novel is solved by the disappointing revelation that two of the characters are depraved and insane. Moreover, the idea of relating serial crimes with Bible verses through code numbers is not only a deja-vu, but it is accomplished in the clumsiest way possible. As if all this wasn't enough, the reader is not even granted any sort of credibility, since the reasoning behind most of the main developments is either unrealistically bold, or plainly stupid; hard to swallow even for a teenager.What a load of crap,One to avoid!
0393088774|5.0|Author:  Dr. Paul Krugman, Nobel prize-winning economist at Princeton and Columnist for The New York Times.<br /><br />How about learning some economics without any of that pestiferous mathematics?<br />This is it.<br /><br />Dr. Paul Krugman's \\"End This Depression Now!\\" is a quite engaging, accessible, readable, accurate, thorough Magnum Opus which has  the \\"feel\\" of a conversation with the author, not a lecture or (gasp!) equations!<br /><br />By page 26 I was certain that this was the definitive explanation of how American Capitalism on Wall Street had mutated into the monster it has now become and the consequences of that monstrosity on 310 million Americans and perhaps just over 7 billion individual Homo sapiens sapiens around the Earth, less the One Per Centers, of course.  (And the 0.1 Per Centers.  And the 0.01 Per Centers.) Look for \\"Magneto trouble\\" and\\" Connecticut\\" and \\"Hedge Fund Managers early on.<br /><br />I am now on page 100.  This is a classic.  Were I to teaching again, I would put this volume on the required reading list, no matter what COURSE I was teaching - especially since not only is NONE of this stuff reported to us through the Corporatist Mainstream Mass Media and NONE of it is taught or even required for graduation from high school or university.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman names the names.  Both Republican and Democratic complicity in the making of this American Capitalist Monstrosity are culpable and named, along with the colossal blunders of economic, regulatory and political players.  Like Alan Greenspan for one.  Except that after admitting that he had been wrong, he doubled down on his prior dogma that had caused the Financial/Industrial Complex catastrophe in the First Place.<br /><br />I thought that I had a distant memory that we had all been through this one before.  And we have.  The Savings and Loan catastrophe of the early 1980s, Dr. Krugman tells us, cost $130 billion US and should have been a warning of what \\"might happen again\\".  He patiently starts with that, the Asian financial crisis, Japan's problem, \\"deregulation dogma\\"repeal of Glass-Steagall (under Bill Clinton in 1999).  Glass-Steagall was repealed due to the pressure  by  citigroup which had had accomplished an amazing feat:  illegally buying Traveler's Insurance Company which itself owned two investment banks, making citigroup in instant violation of the law separating usual banking and investment banking and insurance and stuff and was allowed to continue that way until Glass-Steagall was repealed in 1999.  No one went to jail.<br /><br />The book also contains the single most lucid and understandable explanation of Keynesian Economics developed by the British thinker John Maynard Keynes.  I don't even remember HEARING of Keynes until early 1970s and certainly not in high school where, somehow, the \\"history\\" textbook avoided even mentioning him at all.  Maybe \\"the establishment\\" as we called it then, wanted only one \\"Evil Emperor\\" and Franklin Delano Roosevelt was it, don't want to bother people with other characters, knowledge, facts, evidence, data and theories which explain why and how economies work at a Macro level as they do.  Just my speculation, but looking back, I DO wonder.<br /><br />With wit and humor, Dr. Krugman  also patiently explains was \\"deregulation\\" and \\"non-regulation\\" - the prevailing political ideological dogma since 1979 - that produced \\"unregulated financial system that was a recipe for trouble.\\"  Dr. Krugman also does his own mea culpa about his earlier book \\"The Return of Depression Economics and the Crisis of 2008\\" in which he was already on to the potential trouble ahead but says that he \\"failed to see how broad the problem was.\\"  That is refreshing.<br /><br />The era of deregulation he calls the Second Gilded Age, and NO, the first Gilded Age was BEFORE the 1920s ; )<br /><br />He takes on his own profession, writing that while Keynes had presciently said that \\"When the capital development of a country become a by-product of the activities of a casino, the job is likely to be ill-done\\".  Dr. Krugman writes thst the study of financial markets had, by 1970 \\"been taken over by Voltaire's Dr. Pangloss, who insisted that we live in the best of all possible worlds.  Discussion of investor irrationality, of bubbles, of destructive speculation had virtually disappeared from academic discourse.\\"<br /><br />Dr. Krugman also demolishes - but politely and patiently - the absurdist \\"efficient markets hypothesis\\"...which claims that financial markets price assets precisely at their intrinsic worth, given all publically available information.\\"  Of course, they don't do any such thing.  Why Enron?  Why Lehmann Brothers.  Why the Financial Crash of 2008?  Of 1987?  Of 1929?  And what about all the NON-PUBLIC information?  Each Bank and Corporation is its own CIA.<br /><br />Dr. Krugman also drops water balloons here and there, such as the report that two political scientists, who used Congressional votes to measure political polarization in the last century, \\"discovered a strong correlation between the share of the top One Per Cent in total income and the degree of polarization in Congress.\\" In short, the first 30 years after World War II \\"marked by a \\"relatively equal distribution of income and authentic bipartisanship while the years since 1980, the Republican Party has moved to the right in tandem with the rising incomes of the elite...\\"  At the end of THAT sentence, I wrote \\"Hmmm\\".<br /><br />He also dispatches the One Per Center argument that Roosevelt really did nothing to end the depression, it was World War II that ended the Depression.  It is almost as if they are looking through the wrong end of binoculars or a telescope.  It was...ahem... government spending that did the trick and...ahem...created so many jobs.  From the Civilian Conservation Corps, the PWA, the WPA, to building aircraft in the Lockheed plant at Long Beach, California, it was...Mr. Eric Cantor...the GOVERNMENT SPENDING that created jobs, not any effort by your so-called \\"job creators\\".  Conversely, it was the Banksters and Cartel Capitalists on Wall Street who caused the Crisis of 2008 in the first place, and then Your Own Republican Party, Mr. John Boehner, who used the 2008 Financial Crisis as an excuse to cut government budgets which wound up with millions jobs being DESTROYED and devastatingly high unemployment, not jobs created, Mr. Mitch McConnell.  I lost count.  To say NOTHING of $1 Trillion USD in student loan debt and the mortgage foreclosure crisis - again. Brought to again by the same wonderful folks who gave you 1929, 1987 and 2008 and repeal of Glass-Steagall in 1999.  And using police state terror tactics to kick people out of their own homes.<br /><br />It seems that I have to mention one term:  \\"credit default swaps\\".  This is the perfect crime.  Banks shower credit-risky folk with robo-signed subprime mortgages the banks KNEW would fail; then packaged them as securities fraudulently sold to gullible investors and basically created an \\"insurance policy\\" called \\"credit default swaps\\" which would protect the bank in the event any of those robo-signed subprime mortgages \\"Designed To Fail\\" actually failed.  Sounds reasonable and prudent, doesn't it?  EXCEPT.  The \\"credit default swaps\\" protected Goldman-Sachs and others and left both the defrauded investors as well as homeowners high and dry.  No \\"credit default swaps\\" for them - only for the Banksters.  And student debt lifetime slavery.  And high unemployment.  And everything ia manufactured these days by slave labor in China.<br /><br />\\"End This Depression Now!\\" (again, no pesky mathematics or equations or stuff) is demonstrative evidence that Dr. Krugman must be a superb professor at Princeton as he is a superb analyst and writer for The New York Times.  I am beginning to get into the \\"How to\\" part of the book wherein Dr. Krugman offers clear policy alternatives to the ideological, dogmatic Cartel Capitalist and Financial/Industrial Complex narrative of the past 30 or 40 years.  I'll save the ending for you.<br /><br />P.S.  I have been calling this \\"Depression 2.0\\" for a couple of years and it is gratifying to see the idea ratified by Dr. Krugman's use of the word \\"Depression\\" -- instead of the misleading media meme of \\"The Great Recession\\" -- in the very title of his book.  Krugman tells you all the stuff that \\"they\\" (The One Per Centers) didn't tell you over the past 30 or 40 years while they surreptitiously infected the American and World economies with the economic equivalent of Acquired Immune Deficiency Syndrome (AIDS).  Otherwise known as Acquired Immune Deregulated Deficiency Syndrome (AIDDS).  Deregulating the economy makes as much sense as destroying your own immune system or pulling the control rods completely out of the nukular reactor leading to a meltdown.
B0018BB20W|5.0|I lost my original, a vinyl, in a fire. This not only brought me back to yesterday but to a month or so ago when I saw them at Westbury or whatever it is called now. The Blues are great and this is the best of them although their other CD's are great too!
