B004MC8CA2|1.0|Wont let me log in even though I have saved my email address and gave all of my info.  then it claims to send me an email and I have to go log onto my email to verify that it is me.  the problem is I never received an email from them to confirm...not even in my junk mailbox. when I try to log back in they say my email is already in use by someone (me) but it won't let me log in. very frustrating!
0345803485|1.0|Unfortunately, I gave into the hype and ended up reading this garbage. I've never posted a review on Amazon before and after reading this book, I felt I had an obligation to warn people. To make long story short, I'm not a prude and I don't mind reading bit of smut here and there. I'm not a literature or word snob by any means, but Fifty Shades of Trash almost made me kill myself.<br /><br />Its poorly written, repetitive and just plain lazy. The sex scenes bore me to death, leads had no chemistry and the main protagonist Ana has to be the MOST boring woman alive. How ANYONE could be interested in her blows my mind. She is more boring than Twilight's Bella, which I didn't think it was possible. I lost count on how many times \\"lip biting\\" was mentioned, or the words Inner Goddess, or the fact that in this smut fiction, the author can't even write the word vagina, but refers to it as \\"down there\\". SERIOUSLY? She throws in there couple big words from thesaurus to make it look \\"smart\\" but fails miserably because it disconnects from the entire story. Ana is bipolar, boring, and unfunny and lacks any real ambition in life. Christian is a creepy stalker, no ifs and buts about it. Nothing wrong with BDSM sex, your sexual preferences are your business, but when a dude tracks you by your cell phone and won't let you wear or drive certain things or let you talk to people, I call this an abusive relationship.<br /><br />On each page, there is at least 4 \\"Holy ****\\" or \\"Oh my\\" and lips are bitten at every moment. I don't know how I got thru it. Hours of my life I will never get back, and I hope that anyone looking to buy this book takes negative reviews into consideration because they are there FOR A REASON. Go see a movie, buy a sub sandwich; ANYTHING will be better than this piece of garbage. I wish I could give it minus zero stars.

006197806X|5.0|PANDEMONIUM is the thrilling, thoughtful continuation of Lauren Oliver's dystopian trilogy, where citizens undergo brain surgery to cure amor deliria nervosa, a disease otherwise known as \\"love.\\"<br /><br />In the first book, DELIRIUM, an uncured 17-year-old named Lena Haloway meets Alex. He seems safe; he even has the signature scarring to prove he's been cured. He hasn't, though, and the two fall for each other. He introduces her to the possibility that love might not be a disease despite society's belief to the contrary. Lena also learns about the Resistance, and the Uncureds living in the Wilds, where love is free to bloom. Lena and Alex make a plan to join them, but during a botched escape, Alex is killed.<br /><br />PANDEMONIUM picks up with Lena being cared for in the Wilds by the Invalids, a fringe group of Uncureds who fight for the social freedom to love. Out there, life is hard --- the Invalids must fight for every scrap of life, or they will starve. It is in the Wilds where Lena is reborn, transformed. The girl from DELIRIUM is no more. The new Lena is hard, a freedom fighter. She pushes thoughts of Alex out of her mind, and when she returns to civilization, she goes with a special task: watch Julien Fineman, the-soon-to-be-cured poster boy for a \\"Delirium Free America,\\" also known as the \\"DFA.\\"<br /><br />But in a sudden twist of fate, Julien and Lena are captured by Scavengers --- havoc-wreaking, anarchic Uncureds --- who raid a DFA rally. Without hope of escape, they find themselves starved and tortured, but why? The Scavengers thrive on chaos. They do not fight for a cause, like the Invalids do. So why kidnap Julien and Lena? They are without a cause and not organized. Or are they?<br /><br />Within the confines of their dark cell, a romance takes root between Julien and Lena. To Julien, Lena is just a girl, cured (she, like Alex, has the fake signature scarring), and free from disease. To Lena, Julien is the enemy. But their time together changes things, and she finds herself drawn to him, despite her love for Alex. Are her new feelings for Julien a betrayal to Alex? Lena finds herself conflicted. She does not want to grow attached to Julien, who just may not be the unwavering poster boy the DFA has made him out to be. Julien finds solace in Lena, opening up to her about his past --- a past he never had been able to share with anyone before.<br /><br />Soon enough, however, they realize that maybe it wasn't fate that threw them together, and that more complicated political machinations are behind their predicament.<br /><br />Lauren Oliver's finely crafted, fast-paced second installment is sure to thrill teenage and adult readers alike. PANDEMONIUM is as much about Lena and Julien's unlikely romance as it is about our responsibility to each other --- how sacrificing one life for the good of many could be, in some instances, one life too many. This multi-layered novel will have readers questioning and thinking, and above all, cheering for amor deliria nervosa.<br /><br />Reviewed by Jordana Frankel
B0026O475M|5.0|I found this movie to be very enjoyable to watch. The story recreates the experiences of Robinson Crusoe in our times when a plane crash leaves a FedEx executive stranded on a desert island.
1410446077|4.0|When it comes to the story of Cinderella, you're stuck with either images of dancing and singing mice, or the bloody limb version from Grimm's. CINDER, however, introduces a whole new twist on the beloved fairy tale that is sure to be something you've never read before --- and is just as exciting. There's a handsome prince, a lost shoe, a horrible stepmother, and even some semblance of a carriage, but not in the way you remember.<br /><br />Cinder spends most of her days in a booth in the market place in New Beijing fixing other people's mechanical problems. Nothing out of the ordinary ever really happens until the day Prince Kai comes in begging for his android to be fixed. Prince Kai and Cinder immediately hit it off, but Cinder knows nothing will ever come of it. There are too many obstacles in the way. For one, a deadly plague is ravaging the countryside, and Prince Kai surely has to focus on finding a cure before he could ever get involved in a relationship. There is also another little problem that Cinder is too afraid to tell Prince Kai, something that Cinder's stepmother and stepsisters won't let her forget --- Cinder is a cyborg. Part human and part robot, Cinder is an outcast in society, and there is no way royalty would ever get involved with a social reject.<br /><br />Of course, the royal ball is coming up soon, and Cinder would like to think that she could attend and perhaps even dance with Prince Kai. Things start to unravel quickly, though, and this dream goes up in smoke. One of Cinder's stepsisters contracts the plague, and Cinder is blamed. Then comes the announcement that the cunning and ruthless lunar queen is coming for a visit, and she intends to force Prince Kai into marrying her or else risk starting a war. While fixing Prince Kai's android, Cinder discovers a secret message about a long-lost lunar princess that may just bring peace between the lunar people and earth.<br /><br />You know the rest of the story, right? Cinder is visited by herfairy godmother who turns a pumpkin into a carriage, Cinder and the prince fall madly in love, Cinder runs away and leaves her shoe, and everyone ends up happily ever after.<br /><br />Think again. This is not the story you grew up with, and let's just say that there is a little more at stake than making sure the shoe fits.<br /><br />I've read some \\"re-imaginings\\" of fairy tales before, and CINDER is by far the best. Marissa Meyer manages to use a fairy tale to provide a glimpse into the future that is more realistic than you might think. It's not hard to imagine technology becoming integrated with humans, nor is it hard to realize that our world will be facing much more difficult problems in the future than we are now. For all of you Cinderella purists, though, there is no need to worry. Meyer stays as true to the story as possible, but leaves enough wiggle room to make sure that you'll be clamoring for the next book in the series.<br /><br />Reviewed by Benjamin Boche
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. Has all you need for a bible study and more, they have great reading plans and many different versions of the bible.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|I wonder just how far into depravity we've sunk when watching the torture of animals for 2 1/2 hours is considered entertainment, including kids.  Big wonder we've got bullies and mass murderers... that's where it starts isn't it... kids and animal torture!  Nice job Spielberg and him with a history of religious persecution.  Interesting!<br /> The worst part of the movie was that the script was lifted in bits and pieces from Black Beauty, Pit Ponnies and other depressing stories.  I walked away feeling depressed, angry and infuriated at the screenwriters, director and producers.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Good &quot;free&quot; game.  Would get kinda boring without buying (or otherwise obtaining) game cash.  Definitely worth checking out, though.  Yep.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Listened to this CD today again for the millionth time and it truly is a super great CD. Great vibe, great songs. Along with Stevies ( In your dreams CD) GREAT GREAT Music !! David Boston  MA
1612130283|1.0|I don't think I will finish it.  I guess I downloaded this late at night and somehow thought it was a New York Times Bestseller--did I get that wrong?  So so boring.  And I'm sorry--does anyone know of a college student who didn't get drunk until the night of graduation?  Ugh.  I can't even speak to the fact that she was not only a virgin, but no man had even put his tongue in his mouth?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it but they just copyed it from New super Mario bros but I have to say its fun to play!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a great game. It reminds me of super Mario bros. I wish there were more games like this.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I like it. yeah it is unoriginal and I do really wish it was a real Mario brothers app but its a good game. I absolutely love the different game slots. that's a big thing for me since all of my friends use my kindle during our lunch. ive lost a lot of game data because there was only one save slot.
B006ON41FC|5.0|this is a great game!I love it! totally worth the buck to play! fly through the trees an collect those nuts!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I loved this app keeps me busy and has a lot of different games to play. Also u have to work to get to the next game.
B004XNPQUO|4.0|this app allows me that 5 minutes I need to just stop thinking and enjoy how thing look and behave. A really wonderful break from daily stress. I use it in elevators, at the carwash, and yeah, even in the restroom during those truly trying days at work.
B006NFKUF6|1.0|This game was awesome then fight with the big robot was a lot of fun. Then after you fight him you see anhelocopter and the game ends right there right when the game was were you couldn't hardly put it down. It stops don't get it it will.just make you mad!
B004FDY4LE|4.0|The first season of the Walking Dead was quite good, with everything you could want--action, excitement, personal conflict, a bit of zombie gore, and enough difference from the comic book version to make it exciting. This final episode was a great capstone to the season, though the CGI at the end was a little too CGI. It definitely made me hungry for the next season!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game so much and I love the open feint games it is just like super Mario brothers except it is a lepruchan! I couldn't think of a word to describe this game it is awesome
1611136954|3.0|The audio book, read by Peter Giles, was very good. It was enjoyable and exciting until the last half of the last CD. The ending was extremely disappointing because it left so many unanswered questions! The number of open questions makes it seem implausible, and I felt rather cheated. Trying not to spoil the plot, one of the ending twists was expected, but there are far too many \\"Why?\\" questions remaining. For example, we will never know why the murder weapon was found when and where it was. We weren't given a satisfactory reason as to why thugs were hired to beat up Mickey. Many other questions remain also. I think Michael Connelly owes us an epilogue.
B004HWQUQK|5.0|I love this book! I have read it 3 times already. Anytime I get stressed I give it a read and it's an amazing help. The author lays out his ideas in a great way that makes Taoism easy to understand. The drawings are cute and help the book a long. I tend to recommend this to anyone I can!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its Mario brothers! this game is fun and addictive.my son downloaded this game by mistake but I ended up loving this game.
0486438600|5.0|This book is great.  I doodle and was looking for some ideas.  Plenty of them in this book.  Well worth the money.
B004T2QZL8|4.0|I like the game but there's only one problem. When I beat the game it just froze and locked up my Kindle fire and I couldn't use it for the rest of the day.Luckily the next day it started working again.I would be very pleased if you could fix that.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I love this app! now I always have a Bible with new and it syncs between all devices. My only requests are more offline versions and the ability to save an offline version to your account if you change devices. I use NLT and I had it downloaded and list it when I changed phones.
B005R32L66|5.0|I love this SKYPE i can see and keep in touch with family. It's the best way to connect with friends u haven't heard from or talk to since high school.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|A friend insisted I read this - didn't want to because I usually don't read his books but this was so different and satisfying.
B004SBS8LA|4.0|The monkey was too kill the child but the child ran liveing the atick open so the monkey got out.
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|fun way to pass the time. however energy depleted too quickly and my main kindle toolbar freezes so I have to force restart my kindle every time I play
B004VMUS9G|3.0|it. was a good app but it took forever to loadand when it did it ran slow the app itself was good it worked great and had fairly decent coloring and graphics good I guess but the factor of how much time it takes to load is absolutely ridiculous.
0439023513|3.0|It was not as good as the first two but it is definitely still a good read! I would recommend reading all of these books, she is a very good author!
B005ZUR724|5.0|It. is what it is a cheap rip of wow but really cool because its on the fire even a crappy wow makes for one of best handhelds
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Very happy with this buy.  I have the hard copy of the book, but love it so much more on my IPad.  Bought the rest of the books after reading this one!
B000N2HBSO|5.0|Amazing read, I cant put it down! Great prose and the words flow so well, I feel like i have been transported to frontier America and know the characters like they are my own friends.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|This update is rediculously large. I would have to delete 5 games in order to keep this on my phone. No deal!
B005LAIH5O|4.0|All hell breaks loose (literally) in this non-mythological based sequel to \\"Clash of the Titans.\\" This story bridges the time of the gods and legends to the time of men. The gods have been losing their power because people have stopped praying to them. Hades, the god of the underworld (Ralph Fiennes) and Ares, god of war (&Eacute;dgar Ram&iacute;rez) join forces to release Kronos from Tartus and destroy the gods. Zeus (Liam Neeson) is taken captive and held prisoner as his power is slowly drained from him.<br /><br />Perseus, son of Zeus (Sam Worthington) teams up with Queen Andromeda(Rosamund Pike), Hephaestus (Bill Nighy) and Agenor (Toby Kebbell) to enter the ever shifting labyrinth of Tartus and free Zeus. Apparently ordering everyone to pray to Zeus to give him power is no longer an option. Alexa Davalos played the original Andromeda...just pretend you are watching \\"Bewitched.\\"<br /><br />The movie gives you a brief intro, but there is no real character build-up with an assumption that you have seen the other film. The action hits the screen from almost the moment the movie starts and continues until it ends. There are a few brief scenes without fighting and killing, but they are designed to set up for the next action scene or action game as the case may be. The special effects were superb. The plot was good in keeping in line with the mythology, however the dialouge could have been better with less phrases designed to be truisms and with more funnier quips. Worthington, still living off his Avatar success, gives us his typical less than stellar performance.<br /><br />No f-bomb, sex, or nudity. Plenty of killing, monster horror, and violence.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is one of the only games on the market ive seen with an overall of 5 stars. amazing! it takes up such little memory and it gives so much. amazing mario parody. simply amazing!
B005LAIGIM|3.0|Eddie Murphy has been making kid's movies for so long he has forgotten how to make them for adults. Eddie plays Jack McCall, a literary agent who has signed a New Age guru, and has agreed to following the guru's ways in order to get the contract. A tree suddenly appears in Jack's back yard, one that loses a leaf every time Jack says speaks or writes a word. The presumption is that when all the leaves are gone, the tree dies and so does Jack and the movie. What happens to the tree, happens to Jack.<br /><br />The humor is how Jack, a constant talker, now has to be silent as if his life depended on it. It has that &#34;Liar, Liar&#34; feel to it, it just isn't as funny.<br /><br />It is a yawner that might work for the 14-16 year old crowd. The movie has some heart warming redeeming value to it, you just have to wait for it until the end. If you want to see Eddie Murphy in his street smart role, try &#34;Tower Heist.&#34;<br /><br />Adult language, no nudity, no real sex.
B0026P3G12|5.0|One of those Mother's day gifts.  She's not my style, but 80 year olds love her!<br />She has a couple of newer CD's and I will have to pick those up to.  What else to you get a mother of that age?
B005LAIH4A|5.0|In the age of Hollywood's seeming endless films aimed against greed, consumerism, and environmental destruction, \\"The Lorax\\" is not to be outdone. Unlike the other films with hidden messages, this one is very direct. The voice of Danny Devito and Betty White made the film very special as you can see them in those roles. The film incorporates some of the original Dr. Seuss poetry to convey the message, but doesn't bog down the film with it as to lose the target audience who may not enjoy it as much as we did when we read the original first edition hard covers in the third grade.<br /><br />The story is about the Once-ler (what's in a name? Ed Helms) who cuts down all the trees and at times looking like Elton John playing the Pinball Wizard. He did this to make the Thneed (a versatile Huggie) that no one wanted until a pretty girl wore one. Ted Wiggins (Zac Efron) wants to obtain a tree because the pretty redhead Audry (Taylor Swift) wants one. Sort of like Brad Pitt suddenly caring about hungry third world kids. There are musical numbers and numerous messages about consumer marketing, greed, bottled water, and the environment. SNL's Nasim Pedrad did the voice of the Once-ler's mom, reminding me of the grandmother in the old Carol Burnett series.<br /><br />Perhaps the best message of the film is that individuals can make a difference. As an adult I enjoyed the film.
B007PTJOV0|3.0|Their are adds in this paid app. Also it is a rip off of Mario Brothers, but that makes it good but I'd recommend an emulator for that.
B005MMJ84K|5.0|Shocking.<br />That is the best way for me to describe this book. When I read Delirium, I had no foresight to a sequal, let alone what appears to be becoming a series. Didn't take much for me to get sucked in and beleiving that Alex was dead, I really startedto fall for the romance Lena was beginning to develop. TOTAL SHOCKER at the end of the book. I can NOT wait for the next intallment, I can only imagine where it will lead.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Good game on Kindle. Does take a little long to get your energy. Energy loss is fast gone. Will play somemore and see how it goes.
B005T87QCI|1.0|it hard to figt!  and block I played once and I never will in a Long time @its paid app what a wast of money .
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|I don't like games where you have to pay money however this is really fun to play. Other than that it's awesome.
0553582038|2.0|I wanna crawl into my bed and weep for the loss of my friend.<br />I dont think I have EVER been thing disappointed on a book before.<br />The first 3 books were absolute daunting and extraordinary.<br />I had never read an author that could surprise so much, I told<br />myself \\"expect the unexpected from him\\" and even though I did he<br />still surprised me in the best way,<br />But now, ohhhh now, he surprised me by creating a book I am dreading<br />and simply can not finish. I feel the responsibility to continue reading<br />but I don't want to. It is torture, its bad. I continue wondering WHAT<br />HAPPENED?! WHY IS THIS SO BAD?!<br />I miss Jon, Dany and Tyron, and even though I still have Arya, Sansa<br />and Jamie its still not good enough. What with all the new booooooring<br />characters and storylines?. It seriously needs major editing!<br /> I am truly disappointed and I need to mourn<br />the lost of the amazing saga of books that took the wrong turn.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|it is a fun game. it sucks because you run out of energy to fast and takes forever to replenish it. Wut all in all it's a fun game. Enjoy playing!
B000HC2LI0|5.0|The product arrived on time, was not a Chinese knock-off, looked great, and plays great.  It is exactly what I was expecting and I highly recommend it.
B0054JZC6E|1.0|You really have to download a bunch of stuff to get more points to get the most out of this app. Otherwise you just have to play the same awful games over n over (you have to earn points to unlock new games). And google play doesn't recognize the fire. so the game ends up being grinding and will make your hand ache.
044042321X|3.0|I bought this mostly for the artwork. I've read the first few books in the series and didn't love it, but I do love fabulously illustrated graphic novels. I also saw there was some detailed description at the end on the \\"making of\\" the book. One warning, this isn't a kid's book. There's some nudity and sex. It bothers me a bit they don't have ratings on these things.
B003INBNXO|5.0|I found another movie with Donnie Yen in it!  This was a very good movie that takes place when the Japanese forces invade and dominate China for awhile during World War II.<br /><br /> The only problem I found with this tape was that there were a lot of descriptions written in chinese and at the start of the tape under set up I put down no captions.  In the future I will have to make sure I put down English for the captions because I did not know what they were describing.<br /><br /> I hope to get the Ip Man 2 soon.
1613820895|3.0|I love the Christian classics and have read many of them throughout the years. \\"Orthodoxy\\" is a well written book, and Chestertons style will appeal to many, but ultimately I found the book somewhat wordy and hard to follow. I much prefer \\"Mere Christianity\\" by C.S. Lewis.
B004LWZW7Y|5.0|This was well worth waiting for.  The character of Puss is played so well you actually believe what he says.  The character of Kitty Softpaws is awesome as she can make moves you don't see.  The story line really puts a big dent into some fairy tales I have read, but who doesn't need a little shake up now and then.  This is a good family movie and worth a lot of laughs for everyone.
B0030DHPGQ|5.0|This books is an awesome read. It's kept me locked in and has shed some great analagies of situations that address the elephant and the rider in each of us. I especially appreciate the way it's written, addressing each section and exploring all aspects until you've fully grasped the full picture and can see how and why it's important to address all types you are dealing with because if they all aren't on board with whatever change you're asking for, the project will fail. A great book.
B004XVMCPI|5.0|This is truly a comedy worth watching.  If all soccer teams played like this it would be the number 1 sport in the world.  The Kung Fu moves are unbelievable, and the force used on the ball during the game is fantastic.  The airwaves from the ball was so strong it knocks the clothes off of the goalie.  Funny stuff.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|There is no adrenaline rush but your brain will stay awake. Nice music. Attractive graphics. Nice twist on the old Sokoban.
1594744769|1.0|This author is new and needs to take some lessons on character development.  I came away from this book not caring about a single character.  I agree with a previous reviewer in that he takes so much time explaining details that do not matter to the story line.  These descriptions would be so much better if given to something that would connect the reader to the characters.  The ending is also disappointing when is becomes apparent that you have just been set up for a sequel.  I kept forcing myself to keep reading this book through to the end hoping it would get better but it never did.  I have never given such a bad review on any book that I have purchased.
B006ON41FC|5.0|Love this game. very addictive n keep me n my friends entertained. &lt;3 &lt;3 love it. u dnt need the Internet 2 play.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|While this game shares many of the same gameplay mechanics as Mario, it is technically not a clone.  The levels are different, and even though the first level shares many features with the classic first level of the original Mario, it has its own merits.  This is a game that shares much with Mario but still brings its own mechanics and level design to the table.  It is also polished well and controls well for the most part.  This is an enjoyable game and well worth the praise it is getting on this appstore.
B007MNV5WU|1.0|I haven't even blight this game yet, but I think that there should be a $.99 game for the kindle fire also, no matter what electronic it is they should all cost the same.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love every single game in there!!!  Best game ever!!!<br /><br />My older sister loves it to. ( she is beautiful. A lot of boys stare at her.)
B007PTJOV0|4.0|fast paced rpg goodness with qualities similar to that of the Mario franchize that is just as addicting. I love this game
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|a nice mix of Oregon trail and farmville with some laughs<br />you will love it. just try it<br />uses energy its a lot of fun try it
0763619612|5.0|One of my favorite authors to work with in class!! I'm a first grade teacher who tries to deal with inter and intrapersonal growth as well as English! This book is a MUST HAVE! Every time one of my students feels he/she's just not good enough... we read it! Kids LOVE it!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is basically on Mario n since Mario is not a app sobyea it it very fun I hope you guys will enjoy also
B007PTJOV0|4.0|would be five stars but too big a rip off of Mario. that's the point though.... anyway if you like the original Mario then you would probably like this
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I'm awestruck. by this amazing game! I only downloaded it because I was bored and noticed it was free. But it is great... and very addictive. haha loving it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|Words cannot describe how much I love this book. Not only did I devour it in three consecutive hours, but I will re-read it again and again. Will and Lake are such unique characters, and the teen-romance cliche is non-existant in this book. Colleen Hoover is an extrememly talented author, unlike some teen romance writers: she takes pride in her work, and it shows. 5 stars! In truth, I would give it more if I could. Bravo Ms. Hoover! Everyone needs to get this book, ASAP.
B005HSL626|5.0|I have loved fruit ninja forever and I cant believe people would give this app zero stars the ads aren't even that bad...don't listen to them. get the app because its fun and challenging and anyone can play it!
B000JMKRKC|5.0|My friend recommended this book si I downloaded it on my kindle. It is such a great read with lots of twists and turns! Such a good book. Writing this review makes me want to read it again!
B006ON41FC|5.0|Okay,most people think this app is a app that would waste your money but those people are lying because this app lets you buy stuff at the store for free and you earn these nuts by playing so you don't have to litterly buy stuff!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game no matter which version I have played it on the Pc the nintendo D's and on my kindel also on facebook and no matter what its always fun and never disappoints me
0345803485|1.0|This series was a disappointment, given all of the hype. I feel the need to take the time to write a review only because I think it's important for anyone deciding whether to purchase this book to see. All of the negative reviews are absolutely write - the language is horribly repetitive, and the poor editing is distracting. Some of the plot twists are so implausible it's ridiculous, particularly that so much of what happens in the book happens in a matter of hours, days and weeks. This includes a man with a strong personality and a very deeply ingrained lifestyle suddenly dropping everything to change and propose marriage to Ana within weeks of meeting her. WHAT? I want to believe a man could do such a thing, but the author's not giving the reader any realistic options to come by these transformations honestly. I am not in the habit of reading books series, but i LOVE good fiction. I read book 2 because I was hoping for redemption - I simply cannot bring myself to read book 3. First time I've abandoned a trilogy - that tells you something.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is very awesome and engaging and entertaining because its free it makes it even better. I love this game.

B00009V7PJ|5.0|Fantastic DVD I would highly recommended buying Cher's farewell tour DVD. A must have for any highly motivated  Cher fan.
B001BW02B8|5.0|I tend to fall in love with the older cds more than the newer ones. I have all their albums and the first two are so much better than the new one! This ablum has got something for every mood of mine. I love it and recommend it!
0062060562|2.0|I chose this book based on the many favorable reviews. The idea is interesting and that kept me going at first. About half way through, I began to think the book could have been written as a short story and be more effective. Plot \\"twists\\" were simplistic and, at times, didn't ring true. I got bored with the repetition and began skimming pages. The end was a bit too convenient. I would not recommend this book to a friend.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love this game. It is a lot f fun. If you play the game often add me AParker728 ...
B006PHD0RW|5.0|its okay. atleast it isnt like 90% of the other apps that i tryed. at first its a little hard, then you get the hang of it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game - nice totorial - fun - easy to learn how to play this game - old and young enjoy
0345803485|2.0|I read this book because of the controversy,I had to see what all the fuss was about.  My first comment is regarding the abuse of women.  Haven't we come further than this?  Haven't we taught women to RUN, not walk away from abuse.  If Anna is smart enough to realize that \\"Mr. Gray\\" was sexually abused as an adolescent then shouldn't she be smart enough to confront this with him or get the hell out of there.  Abuse is not love and she should see that.  I think that this book was written to fill the author's pockets and not the readers heart.  If you want steamy love scenes, read J.D.Robb and get a compelling storyline along with it.  Don't waste your time and money here.  Sorry, I love love love to read but...enough said.
B006OCM0G0|5.0|I love all of the games this company makes because they are simple but challenging! I get on them everyday! I suggest pet shop story  bakery story city story and farm story!
068484267X|5.0|Frank McCourt came out of nowhere with this raucous debut, a memoir of tragedy mixed with charm. It details the period of his life from child to adolescent in Limerick, Ireland, in the muddy days of Postwar Britain. His father, a man devout to his country and the drink, instills in him an appreciation of the world and its temptations; and his pious mother does her best to teach him values and gratuity. These all combine to make McCourt's literary voice, which is once refreshingly original and carefully contemplative of the tragedies that are continually visited upon the family within a few short years. Any other writer would make this the most depressing book in recent publication history, but in his hands it is palatable, wise, and oftentimes very funny. McCourt's childhood seems light years apart from what most people have today, but there is still a very human optimism and self-sufficiency throughout the keeps the book from wallowing in despair. The end result is a memoir that, while perhaps more imagination than fact, shows resiliency and a wry enjoyment of life that is stripped bare of ann incidentals. The book's success is a no-brainer- its appeal is wide and deep. Recommended for all modern lit fans.
0345803485|1.0|Real erotica does not contain the term \\"holy cow.\\"  The male wears grown up shoes, not Converse sneakers.<br /><br />One of my book club ladies selected this book, and at our next meeting I fully expect her to be showered with copies of this book, all aimed at her head.<br /><br />I am surprised that such a poorly written, cheesy book was ever published in the first place, and truly shocked that it is getting the attention it is.<br /><br />That there are so many reviews raving over this saddens me. It's garbage.
B005IZLPME|4.0|really enjoyed the movie. its not academy award material but the scenery really is great as well as the 3d efects[[ASIN:B005IZLPME Captain America: The First Avenger (Three-Disc Combo: Blu-ray 3D / Blu-ray / DVD / Digital Copy)]]
B000AQJPQE|1.0|Had a lot of anticipation for this toy, but was let down quickly.  Setup was easy, put the wires, planets and batteries in.  Worked for the first 2 attempts, then nothing. Dead. Nada.  Clicking the remote would not turn it on.. Changed out the (already new) batteries for another new set on both sides - still nothing.  Verified that the IR emitter was working - it was. I am a very technical person and immediately took this thing apart to look at its guts..  Verified that all components had the necessary voltage - seemed ok.  Shoddy overseas work with poor quality soldering, cheap components etc.  Oh, and when it did work, the motor is very loud.  I would not pay any more than $10 for this (provided it works)...  When I get time, I'll hack in a new ATTiny85 and build my own controller..
B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am not much of a Biography buff, but I must say I really liked this book.  I don't know if it was because of my age, but I could identify to every single apple product described and the longing to own one.<br /><br />I think this book can be enjoyed by any single person who has had an ambitious purpose in life.  Really inspiring!
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|Although I cry at movies, it's not often I have to struggle through tears to finish a book. Green Mansions and Mockingjay are the two books that made me cry. It feels like it would be totally redundant to summarize this book, trying to point out the good bits. It's just an excellent book. Read it.<br /><br />One word to parents, though. Because of the popularity of the series and the new movie, local elementary school libraries have been clamoring to have the books for their students. These are definitely NOT for younger children. They would not understand the complexities of the messages held in the books. Nor should they be subjected to the violence. Of course, I wouldn't let my kids play Grand Theft Auto, so I guess I'm the mean mom.
B007Q476KU|5.0|This movie is one that you must see, the story is amazing, the directing is exactly what it should be.  There is joy  and sorrow.. there will be tears running down your face but there will be a smile shortly.  What stands out the most is the views form multiple sides. We really enjoyed the movie.
B0054TVW04|4.0|Ferguson again looks critically at events of history and relates them to the present.  As all historians he has a point of view, but he always gets to the essence of the events he describes which makes his worldview most relevant.  A very good read.
B006UKC566|5.0|This movie on 3D is great. I was specting less quality but I was wrong, it was made thinking on the new 3D universe.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Trust me, you'll love it! Its the same as Mario but its a lepercaun looking for gold  instead of a princess. :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|my kids love Mario.  I am so excited to show them this new app.....I know they will love it. thanks for making it available.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me of retro Mario brothers.kids love to play this game.graphics are pretty good.look forward to future updates.
B002IFT1ZA|4.0|After reading the books, was happy to see the HBO series available on DVD.  Ordered the set and was not disappointed.  The producers kept the tone of the books and I think improved the tempo.  The first episode had lots of blood and bare bottoms, but that may have been a \\"hook\\".  They seemed to glorify it less as the series matured.  Very enjoyable for the mature viewer.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I got so addicted so fast..it's a very, VERY fun game! I new it was gonna be good based on the other reviews..they were all right!(:
1401302378|5.0|I found this something like a scrapbook of impressions, facts and notes taken on a journey of discovery with Anderson as a sort of Lewis and Clark of the post 2000 internet world.<br /><br />He details the main perceived features of a giant unexplored continent based on fast personal computers, broadband internet, mass publishing and search in what he calls the \\"Long Tail\\", something that was always there, but previously too difficult to access.<br /><br />The book has a sketchy nature but he makes it clear that we are participants in the first stages of this exploration, and that he is not writing history after the event. Google, Apple, Amazon etc. are all making prosperous paths through a whole new world of possibilities but not really knowing where it all leads.<br /><br />I have to give this book 5 stars for the best shot yet at explaining these remarkable events and showing how radical they really are.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love this game it is so much like Mario. this is a great app and works very smooth. great job nerd brothers!!!!
B000F8O2PG|4.0|Love the Stargate series, however the earlier seasons are the better.  The original cast has been great, and I did miss Daniel Jackson the year he was off the show.
B0052GVGYG|5.0|This is one of those rare recordings that I just start at the first track, and let play all the way through. It's a very solid set of music, with nary a throw-away song on it. I'd call it \\"easy-listening blues\\" if I had to give it a label.<br />One standout song is Midnight in Harlem. It's pretty long, but you wish it wouldn't end. The first half is Susan giving a gorgeous vocal, with some great backup singing, and then like desert after a great dinner, Trucks lays down a slide solo for the ages. I mean its pure genius. You gotta at least buy this song, but really get the whole album, you won't be sorry.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game love it play it all the time<br />ge t this game ill love it<br />ugh out of stuff to say
B007PT3QOQ|2.0|This could be a very addictive game. However, the energy depleted too fast and I was stuck waiting 3 minutes for 1, yes 1 energy. I am not interested in spending real energy to make real money to just spend it on fake energy to chop a tree, collect stuff or feed animals. It worked wonderfully on my kindle fire but they need to update and change the energy consumption rate.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game reminds me of one of my all time favorite nintendo games Mario land.it was great back then and this is great now.
B001DAJZI4|4.0|great product at good price. I had been waiting for this to be afordable. didn't happen so i went for it
1401233384|4.0|This book is suppose to erase all if the convoluted continuity that DC has been choking on for the past twenty years. While I'm not sure it did clean the slate for the new 52. What I am sure of is this is an entertaining book with Barry Allen as the main man saving the day.<br /><br />A good read and the price is fair. I say if you have just gotten into the new 52 you should get this and whatever tie in you want. I'm getting all of em.
B004LWZW8S|5.0|Before seeing this, I feared that the low reviews were because it was typical Hollywood junk- predictable and thin. Much to my surprise, however, the low reviews were by people complaining that it WASN'T typical Hollywood junk. Apparently, most people still think that Michael Bay is a gifted filmmaker.<br /><br />This is so different than what I'm used to seeing in an action movie that I'm frankly surprised it was made at all. Yes, the hats that the gods wear are way over the top. Yes, you must pay attention to what is going on. Yes, the bad guys are really \\"bad\\" and appallingly violent. No, the ending won't be what you expect.<br /><br />Watch it and decide for yourself, but don't expect it to be comfortable and familiar.
B003Y5H5F6|5.0|Saw it in theatres the day it came out and it was well worth the money :) lots of awesome action scenes... I think the only downfall of it was that it was SHORT compared to the other 2 hour movies, I wanted MORE! But nonetheless great flick! Can't Wait for the next one!
B0025UHKNS|5.0|I had a Suunto t4d. There is no point of comparasion this garmin is much more superior. It has more funtion. At begining was difficult to star trainning, but now I can do it with out problem
B004WR125O|4.0|This device works great and was easy to set up.<br /><br />If you use it to listen to Pandora like I do, you get the high quality 128kbps stream. I have a Logitech squeeze box upstairs and it only gets a 31kbps stream.<br /><br />The only reason I am giving it 4 stars is because you lose IPOD usb access. But you can keep all of your music on computer that runs a dlna server or NAS that has one built in.
0307887960|5.0|This is a great book.  The diet is laid out in very easy to understand terms.  This starts as a diet but evolves into a healthy eating plan.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|the apps is great. I am having a lot of fun with it. its my second day and I cant put it down.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great platformer and not as frustratingly hard as some of the original Mario games. Having fun playing it and the leprechaun theme is pretty cool.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This book was the selection for our monthly book club and although I had heard it was good, I was reluctant to read it knowing the premis of the story.  Having said that - it was one of the most engaging books I've read.  I love the fact that a girl is the main character.  She is a great example of a strong, resourceful, decisive female without being coldhearted - a great role model for young girls today.  Collins' writing style grabs the reader from the beginning and holds it tight through to the end.  I can't wait to begin the second book.....
159562015X|4.0|This book and the test are less complicated than other personality profiles, but still pretty \\"on the money\\" for pointing out my strong points. Helpful for the journey as I rectify mistakes I've made in dealing with people.
B0063IH60K|5.0|addicting in a good way. It is easy to play and keeps me on my toes. an old standard that doesn't get old.
1455508977|5.0|Loved the story, did not want to put it down, was afraid it was going to end bad. I will read it again after I see the movie.  Very good story line.  Was very real to me.
B0071XO8RA|5.0|The story includes an information silo, an evil bureaucracy that pulls the wool over people's eyes and a well developed alternative universe.
055358202X|5.0|I don't understand all the hate for this book. I just finished this one and it is just as good as the other three. I was a little dismayed that I wouldn't get to read about Jon Snow, Daenerys, Davos, or Bran at first, but that passed! I thoroughly enjoyed reading about characters new and old. Perhaps especially the old ones, considering we hadn't got to see their perspective or what they were doing. I consider this to be sort of refreshing. I had been reading about the same dozen or so characters for about 3000 pages, and to pick up the book and read about others was nice. It lends the realm a realer  feel. You get the feel that there are many characters involved, large and small, just like there is in life.<br /><br />As I said, don't believe the hate. This book is just as masterfully woven as the other three.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|it is so entertaining keeps me up all night playing. it gets better and better each time I play. all the games on it are amazing.
B003L16FAE|5.0|Just like everybody else, I'd seen Predator half a dozen times. I consider it to be one of the best action movies of all time. But even classics can be watched only so many times before they get old. I bought this blu-ray figuring it'd be a good start to my \\"favorite movies\\" collection. When it arrived and I watched it, I couldn't believe that I was watching a film from the '80s. Why, it looks like it was shot yesterday! Gone is the gritty, dark feel of the original. I find it difficult to describe the upgrade. You find yourself looking at the rich, verdant jungle almost as often you find yourself looking at the pretty explosions. I recommend this blu-ray to anybody with eyes.
B004UXUX7S|4.0|I had missed this highly rated (by the critics) movie in theaters, so I finally got around to renting the Blu-ray over the weekend.<br /><br />It's mostly a sad drama about a man slowly losing his wife after a boating accident, but there are a few comedic moments along the way that are realistic, rather than forced. The writing and the entire cast are great. I'm not the biggest George Clooney fan, but his work in Up in the Air and The Descendants has totally made me a believer in his acting talents when given the right material. The girl who plays his oldest daughter is very good as well. One of the better movies I've seen in 2012 and worth checking out.
B001UGB1X8|5.0|very good movoe. tommy lee jones great. also enjoyed mary steenburgen and john goodman performances. good story line and plot twists
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just like mario on Wwii and I love it so much also I think it is hard because you have to use controlled.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Good interpretation of the Mario brothers game. I really enjoy it. I would love to see a sequel. Hope to see more games like this.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is wonderful! Just what I needed for my everyday feeding of the word of God!!! I have it on my kindle fire and my htc. inspire and it works flawlessly so I am able to read my Bible everyday on either device. I also love the way it keeps me caught up in each device at the same spot where I left off the day before. I love that I can share God's word on facebook and bookmark<br /> important passages and also create my own notes! Couldn't get any better than this!! Love it!
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This was an excellent read.  I througly enjoyed it and can't wait for the movie to come out.  I was a little hesitant about buying it after reading some of the reviews and decided to buy it because Nicholas Sparks is a good writer inspite of what some of the reviews said.  Maybe not everyones cup of tea, but I like his writing.  Great love story and that's what I like.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love the game its the best game I ever played!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! My mom would proboly love this game. I love this game sooooooo much.

B004LWZW8I|4.0|I enjoy this type of movie that envisions what life might have been in ancient Rome. The movie allows me to live a life that happened long ago. Whether fiction or non-fiction, the film has meaning if it touches some part of the human psyche.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|nice graphics easy quests I play more than one game at a time so energy doesn't bother me that much.
145162445X|2.0|First let me say that this book isn't bad at what it covers (but nor is it good). However, what it covers is mostly general cosmology and quantum mechanics, with an occasional aside concerning \\"why there is something rather than nothing.\\" In fact, in a 185 page book (omitting the \\"Afterword\\" by Dawkins), the chapter that is actually about the supposed theme of the book does not come until page 141, and even then it is disappointing.<br /><br />The author sets up his premises nicely at the beginning of the book. He talks about the different kinds of \\"nothing\\" (i.e., empty space vs. lack of even space vs. lack of anything including the laws of physics). And then he completely fails to deliver. He never even addresses the most profound \\"nothing\\" (lack of even the laws of physics) in any detail.<br /><br />If you want to read about cosmology or quantum mechanics (which implicitly address some of the \\"something from nothing\\" issues), pick up some of the books by Brian Greene (\\"The Fabric of the Cosmos\\" or \\"The Elegant Universe\\"), or Brian Cox (\\"The Quantum Universe\\" is excellent, as is \\"Why Does E=mc2,\\" though that last one is a bit off topic). By the time you've digested some of the better books on these topics, \\"A Universe From Nothing\\" has very little to offer beyond its misleading title.

B005LAIGPU|5.0|When I first heard about this film, I thought that it was simply another cheap \\"found footage\\" attempt at the superhero genre about three kids who get superpowers and one of them is mentally unstable.<br /><br />This is why, generally, marketing sucks.<br /><br />Thus at first I ignored it, not really caring until I saw statements from comic-book creators and others whose opinions I really respect calling it a great film. This piqued my curiosity. I wondered why so many people were really enjoying this film. I finally got around to seeing it this past weekend, and I can say wholeheartedly that this is an excellent film that is more in the vein of the great \\"found footage\\" film genre, like CLOVERFIELD, THE BLAIR WITCH PROJECT, and THE LAST EXORCISM rather than the lackluster attempts such as QUARANTINE, the PARANORMAL ACTIVITY franchise and most of the associated horror films it spawned.<br /><br />The way that I see the film is as a great entry into the superhero genre, relating to characters like Spider-Man and The X-Men. What if three high-school boys got superpowers, but didn't have the moral compass of a character like Professor X or Uncle Ben?<br /><br />The film is the brainchild of director Josh Trank and his co-writer Max Landis (son of the once-great John Landis), and it embraces the tropes of superhero cinema and the \\"found footage\\" conceit and it turns both ideas on their heads. While most of the film is shot from one point of view, as their telekinetic powers grow, they're able to move the camera to unnatural POV shots rather than just keeping it static. And especially the third act of the film begins to use several different cameras, such as camera phones, security cameras, ATM cameras and police surveillance cameras splicing them all together to get a greater perspective and sense of cinematic urgency that films of this type generally lack. The special effects of the film are crucial and very rarely do they not feel seamless. Trank also gives the control of the in-film camera to the most important character rather than let it change hands terribly often or give it to a secondary character. This allows us to watch the evolution of the character's arc and give it a more organic feel.<br /><br />The film also features powerful performances by Dane DeHaan as the increasingly isolated and troubled Andrew and Alex Russell as his conflicted cousin Matt. The only issue that I have with the film, and it's a pretty minor quibble, is that the dialogue sometimes doesn't feel natural, and I think that's more of an issue of restraint rather than the actors playing it badly or the writing being poor.<br /><br />When all is said and done, the film is very clever, very well-paced (it's very brief, running at around 80 minutes), and very well-acted. It puts a very refreshing spin on a genre we're becoming maybe a little too familiar with and helps breathe new life into it. It really is the first great film of the year.ol of the in-film camera to the most important character rather than let it change hands terribly often or give it to a secondary character.

B007K3JCAE|4.0|The lives and partnership of Sherlock Holmes and Dr. John Watson have been retooled, played with, reimagined and played very straight throughout their long cinematic career; from films like Billy Wilder's [[ASIN:B00005JKHF The Private Life of Sherlock Holmes]], which explores the possibilites of the Holmes/Watson partnership, and [[ASIN:B005ETAMHS The Seven-Per-Cent Solution (Universal Vault Series)]], which deals with Holmes' more addictive nature, and [[ASIN:B0000AUHPC Young Sherlock Holmes]], from Chris Columbus, who directed the first two HARRY POTTER films, and of course the fantastic PBS series [[ASIN:B004132HZS Sherlock: Season One]] from Steven Moffat, who's made an incredibly engaging modernizaton, Holmes and Watson are not the inviolate characters that purists would like us have them be. Guy Ritchie's big-budget big-screen treatments of their adventures, with the first self-titled film, and now with A GAME OF SHADOWS, handle the character deftly but with a wink in his eye and a manic spring in his step rather than the traditional visage of a frown, a magnifying glass and a hunting cap. This not-entirely-alternate vision of the character has more to do with the casting of Robert Downey Jr. as the world's greatest detective of the Victorian age as much as anything else. Downey's Holmes is constantly exercising his mind with new devices, new disguises and new mysteries as well as constantly abusing his body with various chemicals (in this film, we see him drinking embalming fluid early on). He's also doing everything he can to insinuate himself in the life of his only friend and partner, the erstwhile and begrudgingly faithful Dr. Watson, who is also given new life by Jude Law as more of a masculine and independent man of action rather than his more common interpretation of the portly sycophant hanging on Holmes' every word. Law's Watson would, at times, rather be as far away as possible from Holmes as possible than being his eternally loyal, eunuch-like companion.<br /><br />With A GAME OF SHADOWS, we are introduced (beyond cryptic references in the first film) to Professor James Moriarty (played perhaps too stone-faced by Jared Harris), nicknamed The Napoleon of Crime and famously Holmes' arch-enemy. At the film's opening, according to Holmes' massive investigation, has already started a plan that looks to throw all of Europe into chaos and war. The endgame, or course, is unseen. Meanwhile, Watson readies to wed his fiancee Mary (Kelly Reilly, reprising her role) and Holmes and his Secret Service brother Mycroft (played with relish by Stephen Fry) intend to take him to his bachelor party. Naturally, the place they end up going to has an entirely different purpose for Holmes than it does for Watson. He investigates a gypsy fortune-teller (Noomi Rapace, the Swedish actress who played Lisbeth Salander in the original MILLENNIUM trilogy, as well as the star of the upcoming sci-fi epic PROMETHEUS) who Moriarty has targeted for murder. She, like Irene Adler (also reprised here in a much smaller role by Rachel McAdams), becomes a reluctant part of the investigation after being saved by Holmes. However the stakes change again for Holmes, who was more self-serving in the investigation rather than personally invested, when Moriarty commits a heinous act that wounds Holmes more deeply than he lets on, but also announces his intention to make Watson and his new bride \\"collateral damage\\" in their game. This, and the other atrocity that Moriarty committed, force Holmes to take more proactive steps to protect the Watsons. They travel from London to Paris to Geneva, discovering new information, gathering new allies and facing new enemies as the labrynthine plot of Moriarty begins to unravel, until it all culminates at a peace summit at Reichenbach Falls, a place famous in the lore of the mental and physical combat of Holmes and Moriarty.<br /><br />The super slow-mo techniques used in the first film to display Holmes' combat acumen is utilized here with an exciting unpredictability since there are occasionally other players at work whose assistance can be unexpected, and makes it as enjoyable if not more so than the first film. Also the same can be said for his myriad glances at seemingly insignificant items and showing how they play out later. The set-pieces are terrific, such as the fight at the bachelor party, the train sequence, and the arms factory. The major set piece, much like the warehouse explosion in the first film now takes place in a dark forest with several pursuers and a very VERY big cannon, and it's terrific, but Ritchie's technical expertise was never in question. He knows how to make a film look good.<br /><br />The problems I do have with the film are mostly in the performance category. Jared Harris has never been one of my favorite actors, and he plays Moriarty mostly as a cold fish, whose placid take on the character is not one of any flamboyance or real menace, with the exception of one scene when he sings along to a Schubert opera as he tortures Holmes. Noomi Rapace is criminally wasted here for such a volatile and vibrant performer. It's not her fault; her part is just terribly underwritten and she does a lot with it, but it's like she's hardly there. Also, Eddie Marsan as the inherently inept Inpector Lestrade is, with the exception of one 30-second scene, is completely absent from this film; a sad outcome for someone who is a vital part of the Holmes mythology and was such a vital part of the previous film.<br /><br />The other problem that I have is with the climactic confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls. I understand what they did in the context of the film; it's more of a war between minds than it is a war between bodies. However, there isn't any kind of sense of satisfaction that the whole film would be leading up to a major climactic physical confrontation. After all, they are both physically adept and, at least in common lore, they are both master swordsmen. It would have been nice to get something more out of the ending. Perhaps screenwriters Kieran and Michele Mulroney (having only one independent film to their names) were a little out of their depth on a major studio outing.<br /><br />Sorry... one last problem: The film seems far too short. There are scenes that either could have been shortened or entirely cut in order to make room for scenes of greater humor, drama, or character. The film ends too abruptly and it seems like it could have been at least fifteen minutes longer.<br /><br />However, the scenes that shine brightest are the scenes between Downey and Law. They have a great, effortless chemistry that translates to an easily believable friendship on the screen. Fry is terrific fun as well, and McAdams continues to play Irene Adler with a flirty yet deadly side, although her role in this film is greatly diminished.<br /><br />Downey, as per usual, is terrific as Holmes. He enjoys playing this role, and that's evident. He's extremely clever as a performer and plays Sherlock Holmes with a vitality and bawdiness never seen before. Law as Watson is equally good as his frustration with Holmes' antics builds to blind rage at moments, all the while deeply caring about Holmes as his friend and always feels the need to stand by him.<br /><br />All in all, this is a very solid 3.5 out of 5 star film, and although it lacks the same punch as the first film, I'd still stand in line to see Downey and Law be Holmes and Watson again.s utilized here with an exciting unpredictability since there are occasionally other players at work whose assistance can be unexpected, and makes it as enjoyable if not more so than the first film. Also the same can be said for his myriad glances at seemingly insignificant items and showing how they play out later. The set-pieces are terrific, such as the fight at the bachelor party, the train sequence, and the arms factory. The major set piece, much like the warehouse explosion in the first film now takes place in a dark forest with several pursuers and a very VERY big cannon, and it's terrific, but Ritchie's technical expertise was never in question. He knows how to make a film look good.<br /><br />The problems I do have with the film are mostly in the performance category. Jared Harris has never been one of my favorite actors, and he plays Moriarty mostly as a cold fish, whose placid take on the character is not one of any flamboyance or real menace, with the exception of one scene when he sings along to a Schubert opera as he tortures Holmes. Noomi Rapace is criminally wasted here for such a volatile and vibrant performer. It's not her fault; her part is just terribly underwritten and she does a lot with it, but it's like she's hardly there. Also, Eddie Marsan as the inherently inept Inpector Lestrade is, with the exception of one 30-second scene, is completely absent from this film; a sad outcome for someone who is a vital part of the Holmes mythology and was such a vital part of the previous film.<br /><br />The other problem that I have is with the climactic confrontation between Holmes and Moriarty at Reichenbach Falls.

0062082353|1.0|I was interested to read this book because I am fascinated by war and the different military branches. While, I can understand there being secrecy to things that any military person is held to, when they come out of the military that they cannot share; I was still hoping that I would have gotten to experience more about what it was like to be a sniper in the military fighting our enemies.<br /><br />I felt more like this biography was of Mr. Kyle's life than of his career in the military as a sniper. There was some snippets of Mr. Kyle's ability as a sniper but there were few and far between. It felt like this book was kind of censored. In fact, I started this book and than put it down and walked away form it for quite some time. I would pass it and think I need to pick this book up again and give it another try. I did give it another try but barely. I skimmed over Mr. Kyle's personal story and after a while, I just went to the end of the book to see final thoughts. I can tell you that I did not miss much but skimming over the book. Not the best book to read if you are interested in the life of a sniper.

I did a little searching and found that their music is quite a variety and really nice.  I am listening to it again here in my office and it is really pleasant.  Some great old tunes that I have not heard in a ages and fun memories.  But what a wide variety of music.  Really fun!

It enhanced the images the Barsoom books created when I read the series as a youth.    I'm stunned with how thoroughly Disney dropped the ball in promoting the film. Where are the toys? The prop replicas? Why were there no tie-ins. The companion art book is sold out!    This is an engaging film.

I'm defenitly going to read the other ones. My friend liked the second the best.<br />The movie was amazing I want to see it again!
B0032Y8XH8|5.0|This is a great breakthrough album by Mumford & Sons. If you're already a folk-pop fan, or just someone looking for a new taste in music, this album is a must. I do not purchase music that often, but I absolutely had to have the physical copy of this. This is one of the only modern albums that I can listen to from begining to end and love every song. I highly recomend!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game I love it. It kind of reminds me of the old super Mario games. my kids love it too.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This game does not require money but u can get extra if you like. I thought it was very fun and the best part for me is the game does not require Internet once it is downloaded!  It was not a waste of space or time like the other gameloft ones! Nice work gameloft.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|haven't had time to play the game very much,  but I Like the game so far. reminds me of frontierville from facebook.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games is a terrific premise, and the movie did justice to the book. The dystopian society of tomorrow wherein we have our young people murdering one another in an annual gauntlet is frightening, and our protagonists do the best they can to stay alive and human. I like the voice utilized in our young heroine, Kariss; vulnerable and believable, and just a touch cynical. Five stars for Ms. Collins.
B0021L8UPS|5.0|this movie is one of the best horror movies i've watched in a long time! the ending was something i didn't see coming at all! the newer horror movies are poorly budgeted remakes or nothing but a blood bath with no storyline. not this one.
B000O5WC8O|5.0|Very durable and detailed. All Schleich toys are of superior quality. The jaguar comes with a baby cub and they are a perfect set, they are anatomically correct and sized perfectly together. Great way to teach kids about animals

B0072X2NUS|5.0|This album needs about 20 listens before it is judged.  It gets better and better with each play.  Very unique layering and textures after a few listens make perfect sense and fall into place.  I really am happy to have this album in my collection.

B0009PAVI2|5.0|I bought this filter case for a variable neutral density filter and a white balance lens cap I am using on my Canon T3i.  It holds both with room to spare and even has a third compartment for another filter.  The lining does not appear to be too rough for an unprotected filter and the case fits in my camera bag neatly.  It can be worn on your belt if you want the filters more easily at hand.  I quickly decided not to use the clip closure as the velcro is more than adequate to hold the case closed.  The construction is good and sturdy and I expect the case to last a long time.  Well worth the price I paid and I recommend it.
0811876373|4.0|in a nutshell: more than anything else- it'sa beautiful book to look at! got super cute pictures & design, fun ideas and great layout, but the cake pops will definetly not look like the ones in the book when you make them (specially if your an amateur)
B006P0FD4W|1.0|I'll put it this way. I'm at the scene with the babysitter. She looks like a barbie doll. I saw her and immediately started singing \\"I'm a barbie girl, in a barbie worrrrlldd\\" in my head. When you can do that during this sort of movie and still not feel any odd effect or feel jarred or anything at all.. well, that kinda tells you what sort of movie it is.<br /><br />It's not that it's a bad movie. The acting is decent, the sets are very nice, costuming is perfectly fine and the writing is alright. It's just.. dull. Dull and long and... yeah.<br /><br />I'm finishing this review just as the babysitter scene is ending and I'm STILL hum-thinking Aqua in my head.<br /><br />Likin' Plastic. It's fan-tasticcc.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very good game.. it reminds me of Mario and it is a very fun and exciting adventure game. cant think of anything bad about it
0380977788|5.0|Other reviewers have discussed the content and the wonderfully haunting tone, so I just want to add that Mr. Gaiman has succeeded admirably in telling a story that allows one to see through a child's eyes again.  Coraline's resourcefulness and ingenuity are highlighted by the fact that she has to find her way through the happenings of the story on her own steam.  There is no one she can fall back on; her parents are dismissive of her problems as childish fantasy, and the other adults are all a wee bit crazy.  Even the wise black cat ends up as a partner rather than a mentor, and Coraline shoulders her responsibilities with admirable fortitude.  This book takes us back to the magical world of childhood imagination, without pretending that world is easy or always bright.<br /><br />As an aside, the illustrations are gorgeously creepy, and fit perfectly with the tone of the story.  5 stars all around!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this app is great it reminds me of all those Mario games that Used to play. this app is awesome.  get it now!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just like the game I remember from school years ago but better super fun and addicting plays perfectly on kindle fire

B002MQYOFW|5.0|Amazing story! Absolutely captivating!!!!  The author does an incredible job at pulling you into this tragic story.  Even though it is makes you shutter to think this could happen, you can't stop reading it.  You want so bad for Katniss to beat the system!  I think this story strikes a nerve with so many, as we watch our own government spiral out of control.  The fear that this could happen and the idea that someone would lead us to a revolution gives us all a sense of hope, for Katniss, and for our own future!
1612130283|5.0|Erotica at its best! Christian Grey is every woman's fantasy even if they won't admit it! I couldn't put the book down! I have now read all 3 books and will be starting over with the first! Love me some Christian Gray...

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Well it's not the original Oregon Trail I grew up playing on the old Apple IIe but it's ok. A lot like fb's Frontierville. I will stop playing if I get to a point of needing to spend real money or having to depend on friends. I like gaming solo. Kthxbye!

B0068RHSCW|4.0|Went into watching this movie thinking it wouldn't be very good.  The movie did not do well at the box office, so I had my doubts.  Surprisingly, it was a very good movie.  I can't really say anything without giving the plot away.  Daniel Craigs character goes into early retirement to spend time with his growing family. Then from there things get weird.  Stick with it, kind of moves slow at first and you really can't put it all together till the very end. I was left thinking about this movie well after it was over.
B002G1YPH0|5.0|This thing reduced my load temps by 33%. I now idle at 26c and loads never exceed 45c. I was averaging 32c idle, 65c load. Love this thing, it is huge though. Barely fit in my CM Storm Scout case.
0061537969|4.0|Ok, so the story is told from the dog's point of view.  I for one found this to be very helpful in keeping a very predictable storyline from going stale.  Denny (the race car driver) and Eve his wife face many trials and tribulations.  It all is told from Enzo's dog eye level and point of view. I going to say it, I know it's been said in other reviews, but I think it helps to get the whole dog point of view if you are a dog lover.  While the story is predictable, it is still a great read. Go Enzo!
0525423656|4.0|A utopia is always hiding a dystopia. Beneath all that perfect living and niceness is corruption and evil like you have never known before. Sadly, a utopia is just a pipe dream. In the Matched trilogy, Ally Condie started with a Giver-esque utopia that gave way to the dystopia hiding beneath. Now, with Crossed, you see what was really going on behind the scenes in the Society's utopia.<br /><br />Cassia was matched to Xander, but she fell in love with Ky. Sent to a work camp in the edge of the provinces, she could only think of escaping to find Ky. As an Aberration, an outcast of the Society, Ky was sent to act as a decoy for the enemy in one of the outermost villages. That way the Enemy only killed outcasts, not real citizens of the Society. When Ky gets the chance to run, he takes a young boy and the only friend he has made at the village and heads for the canyons. When Cassia sees an opportunity to get out of the camp where she is held, she takes it and ends up at one of the outer villages used as decoys. Once there, she and Indie, another girl from the camp, pick up and head the direction of the canyons where they assume Ky will be.<br /><br />Along the way through the canyon, both groups make a lot of mistakes and realizations. It is clear there are things even their cynicism wouldn't lead them to have believed the Society was capable of. When Cassia, poisoned by the tablet the Society makes as a \\"lifesaver\\", refuses to stop moving, her determination not only saves her life from the poison, but also leads her straight to Ky. What she doesn't expect when she finds him is for the two of them to have hugely different paths to take for the future. Cassia is drawn to the resistance, in the hopes of stopping the Society, but Ky knows how damaging the resistance can be for those who are involved in it. They have finally found each other, but will they be able to stay together?<br /><br />This was not your average sequel because the story has taken such an enormous turn from the original novel. While the original novel was much more a fallen utopia, the dystopia in this book rings loud and clear. It is hard to miss, actually! The Society is such an evil, oppressive society and all you want is to see them taken down. In fact, while I can see Ky's side of things, I have to agree with Indie and Cassia- I would totally want to join the resistance. Although this sequel was a complete turn-around from the original novel, it still felt like a set-up for the final story. The action isn't enthralling, but it is certainly interesting. I think the final novel in the trilogy will be the best story yet.<br /><br />This is a great story for anyone who liked the Giver or any other young adult dystopia. It isn't too graphic or harsh, as are frequently the complaints about dystopias and post-apocalyptic stories in the YA genre. Instead, Condie prefers to let the grim future speak for itself and the oppressive government's actions leave much to the imagination. This is a great trilogy, but I am anxious to see how it ends now. The drastic switch in direction will surely make you feel the same way!n from the original novel.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|Super Mario but funner . Best free app yet. love all the levels. keep up the good work. looking forward to updates
B004SH40BQ|4.0|Purchased 1 week ago.<br /><br />This does what it says and works well, but as  mentioned earlier don't expect to get more the 90 mins out when using with a 6G Nano. I have it paired with bluetooth headphones which only last just over 2hrs so it all works out in the end. If you going on a long trip make sure you use wire head phones.<br /><br />Paul
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I think it is fun but it should come with all the games and u don't have to earn it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun game to pass time along. there's nothing better than being a leprechaun collecting gold. you even finish each level at the end of a rainbow.
B007J4T2G8|4.0|I wasn't quite sure what to think when I started reading this... Christian is not my type at all.  Ana seemed childish and too young... But for some reason, I could not stop reading this. It hooks you in and doesn't let you go.  I didn't like Christian to begin with, but grew to love him.  I have finished the series, and have added it to my keepers, give it a chance even if it's not something you normally read.  It's worth it.
B004H1V5RU|5.0|I bought this for my son after he saw it at a friends house and I have already bought another one to give as a birthday gift for one of his friends. This is a fun and challenging toy for kids of all ages...and even adults too.  I am extremely happy with the purchase.  It is of sturdy quality.  It is so nice to see him playing with something other than an electronic device!!!
B007IXWKUK|4.0|Book two was a must for me to buy before I even finished book 1.  I had to know more about Christian.  Ana's a given, you grow to know what she'll say before she says it.  Christian intrigues (sp) me.  I have finished the series and even tho I feel the price of each book was too high, I bought them anyway without regrets.  It was worth the read.... I am a little sick of hearing about Ana's inner goddess, but I get over it...
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|hard to put it down. good grafics. reminds me of the classic game we use to play in grade school
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I was unsure when I purchased the first book in the series, but ended up loving it all.  I didn't like Christian to begin with, but grew to love him.  Even tho I am done reading this, I am still thinking about it... How fortunate I was to have the childhood I did, obviously there are those who are not so lucky.  I loved Ana and Christian and their HEA.... Great read.  It's going in my keepers... I'm sad that it's over, that's when you know it was a good series.

B007ATHNJA|5.0|This is one of the greatest of all operas and one of the most problematic. Opera as an art form was less than fifty years old when the ageing and terminally ill Monteverdi and the rakish librettist Busenello (and possibly others) staged this morally lax, sexual political bedroom romp full of ambition driven people who appear to have been totally lacking in virtue or have carefully hidden any trace. \\"Deh,nasconditi, o Virtu'\\" (1643 Teatro SS Giovanni e Paolo, Venice). Claudio Monteverdi died a few months after the opening. There are several conflicting manuscripts of this opera but from later dates (1651). This production uses a new edition of the score by Jonathan Cable. No other information is given<br />I have several versions of this opera both DVDs and CDs and each has some particular outstanding trait or character. For Seneca it's Robert Lloyd in the Maria Ewing DVD but her Poppea is too sentimental. For Ottavia it's Anne Sofie von Otter in the John Eliot Gardiner CD who's lament is truly heart rending but the vehemence and hate in her order to Ottone to kill Popea is frightening. But the two characters who really matter in this opera are Nero and Poppea. The Nero here is Philippe Jaroussky and I think the best of the lot. He brings to this very nasty, self-serving character an air of innate rotteness that comes across in his alto counter-tenor but still gives off enough 17-keto steroids in the voice to let us know that this is a man. His voice has a sneering quality to it and it blends perfectly with that quality in the great star Danielle de Niese. In her previous disc of this role with Emmanuelle Haim conducting and Alice Coote as Nero there was certainly fire and sensuality but a bit too much sliding of notes and rubato of tempo for me. In this disc she is more precise in tone and tempo and I might add she becomes the Poppea of the times. She has mastered nuance and covered deceit wonderfully well. This Poppea can turn her back on a former lover and is now possessed by ambition as was Anna Bolena to come. Nothing matters but to become Empress at any cost. Danielle's stage presence is remarkable. She walks on a crowded stage and no one else is there. She sings with her body as well conveying an unique ability to demand the attention of everybody. She is a wonder to behold.<br />The Ottavia of Anna Bonitatibus was too old and stiff. Her lament was a disappointment. The Seneca of Antonio Abete was also dull. However the two nurses, Arnalta & Nutrice, and their description of the perils of old age were great. Venice opera at the time had comic parts mixed with dramatic in a presentation. Thus the nurses were played by old men in drag using falsetto. Needless to say the music of Les Arts Florissants with William Christie was right on. What a pleasure to listen to those antique instruments really sing! Pier Luigi Pizzi did the costumes as in the the first DVD I own. Here he is much more austere than the lush extravagance of the previous recording. In all the costumes fit the action more closely although sometimes it look like they had borrowed the dining room drapes. This recording is a great success. Even if you already have several DVDs or CDs invest in this one. Highly recommended.possessed by ambition as was Anna Bolena to come. Nothing matters but to become Empress at any cost.

0307279189|5.0|My husband read the book and bought it for his brother.  He loved the book so much that he is reading it a second time.
B004EPZ03O|4.0|Positives:<br />I wasn't sure if the human and puppet (OK, muppet) interaction would look natural but credit to the writers, director, actors and muppets for making the blending of their two worlds seem believable. Success is when you start responding to them as living creatures. Typical muppet antics and humor dialogue for all age although a bit more for the older crowd as in the tele series.<br /><br />Negatives:<br />I would have liked to have seen more muppet comedy, music and interaction with contemporary stars. The ending was also a little anticlimactic.
B001NLKT60|5.0|The book continuously kept you guessing.  What was going on?  What was going to happen?  What in the world is this all about.  Kept me intrigued and turning pages!
B0064NTZJO|5.0|It's a dark and tragic film, excellently executed. Dark and twisting, with some sweet and poignient moments. The musical score is full of beauty. I enjoyed it. It's a little like a dream. Very stylised.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|Many of my student ts have read this and The author gave a presentation at the school where  I work -then, my college student  read this and said what a good book it was. I put it on my kindle and proceeded to read it in less than ten hours.<br /><br />The story grabs you from the first page. It ties a series of seemingly innocent teenage situations together and explains how they all combined to convince Hannah that she should end her life. It can (or should) make people think about how their choices and \\"innocent\\" acts could seriously impact someone else.<br /><br />The book tells an important story and should make an impression on each person who reads it. It's not a light read, but it is am easy read. The author does a good job of telling the story.
B000W4KT64|5.0|The DVD arrived in a timely fashion and in the exact condition in which it was described.  It plays great, and I could not be more pleased!  I highly recommend this seller.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|I read all 3 books in less than I week.  I couldn't put them down.  However, I finish with a sense of emptiness.  Although I thoroughly enjoyed all of the books, this one was my least favorite.  I agree with what a few others have said, the character build-up for many of the characters was so well done that when several of them died in this book it was a major let down.  I feel myself still asking questions, 2 days later, about what happened.<br /><br />(Spoiler) Finnick and Annie had a baby?  Why even mention that when there is no purpose and how or when could that have happened?  There were so many points in the story when Katniss was unconscious or out of it that I am very unclear about the actual timeline.  However, she is always still Katniss Everdeen, still 17 years old.  Is that even possible?  It seems she was 17 forever...<br /><br />I fell in love with and became close friends with many of the characters and then before I know what happened, gone...  without explanation.  What happens with Gale, her mother? Why are they non-existent in the Epilogue? Why? Why? Why?<br /><br />I re-read the last 3 or 4 chapters several times to try to figure out what I had missed.  This last book was much harder to follow and I re-read several parts thinking, what on earth is the author even talking about here.  Definitely not as clear a plot as the other 2 books.  Still I loved it and wish there were more to it.
1612130283|5.0|I jumped on the band wagon like everyone else after hearing all about this book on tv etc, and I have to say it far exceeded my expectations. Kept my interest from the first page to the last and could not read it fast enough. I have since read the other two as well and I wish there were more!!! I dont want to say too much about the story because I don't like when people reveal too much in the reviews but it was an amazing series and fell in love with Christian and Anastasia!! Can't wait for the movie.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game got it free in app. store for free. not bad only thing so far I don't like is that it takes too long to revive your energy.
B002ZB26AO|4.0|Nothing to Envy is well written, well documented, and a very good read. It is also a very painful read that is almost beyond imagination in its description. My son is teaching in the South and has met some of the refugees from the north. His experience verifies some of what is in the book. What a disaster is in the making.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|howdy y'all I love this game. so far it has my interest and I haven't had any problems yet...I am hooked on it. it has good graphics looking forward to building my town.
B004SJ3AXI|5.0|I really like all of the different puzzles and different characters. you should try it. on Easter my family was taking turns playing the easter.
B004DI7HZ6|5.0|My daughter gave this book to me and told me I would love it. It's not the kind of book I would have chosen for myself but I read it for her. However, after I started I couldn't put it down. I found it fascinating and intriguing. Now I am waiting patiently for the next book to come out.
B0067LY4WG|5.0|CD arrived very quickly and in excellent condition.  The CD itself is an incredible piece of musicianship from an incredible musician.  Strong recommendation!
B005LAIGYQ|5.0|This movie shows exactly what these Americans do to keep us safe. These are the most elite and real movie since they use real \\"active duty navy seals\\" doing the acting so it's as real as it gets. One of the most amazing movies I've seen in years!!! Should be recommended to be watched in every high school to show what these brave and courageous men and woman for Americas safety and freedom. They do not bat an eye to make the ultimate sacriface for this nation or each other. These guys are soo badass that you have to see it for your self, one more thing, they used LIVE AMMUNITION in the making of this film with not a single accident or scratch on anyone. That's how precise and badass these guys are! Love it 10,000 STARS!!!!!! LOL!!!
B0052U59F4|5.0|I started reading Fifty Shades Of Grey,as a recommendation from a friend who thought I would enjoy it. She had heard other women  were raving over this book, but it was hard to find. I was able to order it on my kindle instantly, and started reading it the next day. My first reaction to this book was that it was somewhat \\"disturbing\\"...but continued to turn the pages anyway. The story was getting interesting and I started to find myself engulfed in the characters lives and personalities. It became apparent to me why so many women were finding this book so intriguing. I must say, I was enjoying it very much, wondering if there were any men out in the real world, like Christian Grey...and if so, where are they??? The only criticism I have is that Christian is too young to be believable. If he was a little older, the story might seem more realistic. Overall, I found this entire trilogy wonderful, and would recommend it to some of my friends, who I think could \\"handle it\\". lol
0061124958|5.0|The book is well bound and the pages are of a good weight and printed on very bright paper with clear ink.  It is a pleasure to hold, and page through, like the books of my youth.<br /><br />The story is also top notch and we have been reading it to our oldest son.  One of my favorite children's stories.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its basicly Mario its awesome to play the game plus it looks amazing this is what I have to say awesome awesome awesome
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like the original Mario bros. its really fun! it's a classic! this game is one that I would recommend
B005LAIGNC|5.0|This is one of the best films I have seen in years.  Awesome graphics as well as dogfight scenes.  I can't wait to see another movie like this one.
B004UUKDNA|5.0|Not many bands are able to put together a debut album that is this good all the way through. They seem to have found their own little place that is their own, the hardest thing for a band to do. Easily my favorite new band of the past year.
B005NS5CX4|4.0|I am a fan of Lady Antebellum. Love their sound. Haven't really found a song yet I don't like. I rarely buy music but got this when it was a quarter. Can't do much better.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I really enjoyed this one. An original and moving story that deals with lots of difficult emotions and issues. Read it in one sitting right thru. The poetry inserts were so powerful - and I dont even like poetry normally. Now, Im intrigued enough that I want to attend a Poetry Slam. This is more than your usual YA contemporary love story. I highly recommend it.
B000E41MS6|5.0|AWESOME! it was a great birthday present for myself. though it took too long to get here, BUT I blame that on how anxious I was to be able to relive season one :) you never forget your fist Doctor.
B0062NAX1U|5.0|Just recently viewed this movie on-demand.  Really didn't know what to expect. This movie was awesome in dealing with everyday<br />problems and the importance faith plays in our lives.  By reaffirming the importance of a \\"father and husband\\" in our lives and the community, it makes a difference.  Change needs to originate in the home and family before it can take root in the community.  Morality needs to be restored, this movie explicitely reinforces the message.  I am back to buy the movie for my collection.
0812548094|2.0|A huge disappointment after the first novel. I got through about half of this novel (hundreds of pages) before I felt all the meandering of the main tale and the love story were making the tale bland. After my glowing review of his first book I reluctantly gave up on this one and the rest of the series. OVERALL GRADE: C minus to C; WHEN READ: 2001 (reviewed early April 2012).
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its Mario meets lucky charms. its very fun and addicting. the controls are very easy and simple and work very well on a touch screen.
0439023513|4.0|This was a great ending to a great trilogy, but there were a couple of issues that bothered me while reading this.<br /><br />First, as mentioned in my reviews of the first two books in this trilogy, the style and unfolding of the plot was a bit juvenile. This hasn't changed here. This can be contrasted with the Harry Potter series, where there seems to be a slight but distinct increase in sophistication from each book to the next, almost as though accounting for the increasing ages of the readers as they progress in the series. In this trilogy, I feel as though there is no real growth in sophistication. Even worse, I feel as though the bold, brash, shiny new \\"veneer\\" that dazzled us in the first book in the series with its outrageously engaging plot has now worn off somewhat and that makes the underlying juvenile aspect of the plot all the more visible. (To give just one example, I find that the rebel \\"army\\" is portrayed extremely ineptly to the point where it's completely unrealistic, where leaders would make stupid decisions on the whim of a stubborn girl!)<br /><br />The second problem I have with the book is the unfolding of the plot vis-à-vis time and details. I feel as though there will be much effort spent on one part of the story, with much detail and explanation (sometimes almost too much so, in a spoonfeeding sense), but then other times weeks and months will go by, battles will be won, and there will be no real expounding on this. Rather than describe battle scenes, the author seems to shy away from such intimidating (to the author?) detail, with the result being that much of the plot is so distantly removed from the battlefront that battles seem to transpire in the background over the course of a mere paragraph or two. This ends up giving short shrift to what seems to be an important component of the story--or, at the very least, a part of the story that could be quite entertaining.<br /><br />Finally, I was disappointed in the growth of the protagonist herself. Katniss, despite the major events in her life forcing her to grow up and face her new world, still seems to be the same somewhat immature, somewhat stubborn girl in many senses. You'd think that after all this time and all these experiences, she would finally move on from some of those silly naïve thoughts and inclinations, especially in regard to relationships, both romantic and platonic, and from some of the juvenile moralizing that she often does. But, no.<br /><br />Despite these setbacks, it was still a well-rounded end to the trilogy, wrapping it up nicely, and still grabbing the reader's attention throughout.
B0054JZC6E|2.0|There is a lot of boring games with little instruction. Developers focused on quantity instead of quality. I'm glad I didn't pay for this.
B0066W1AZK|4.0|This is one of the best chess app i have seen in a long time.<br />Some features are missing like<br />a) Number of games won when playing against computer/Statistics;<br />b) Tips for the next move.<br />But apart from these, it's a fantastic app !!
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|most of the book, katniss is in a state of nervous breakdown, sleeing in the hospital, drugged, or giving the world the silent treatment because shes so sad. its rediculous. shes got to be the weaest protagonist ive ever read about
B00511ONPG|5.0|Well, this book is a great book. And I don't know what else to say, I just wanna give it a five star and not review it :p
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|I was highly enjoying this game and decided to join gameloft to add friends for gifts.  Big mistake.  Now I can not get back into the game!!!  Very dissapointed.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|it was pretty good. the only problem is that u need wifi to use it... but its a very good bible app. enjoy :)
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Very fun. Controls can be difficult but its still very addicting! My favorite &quot;create a town&quot; game! I love the amount of some tasks.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|Some audio bibles do not work on my tablet but this is still a pretty cool app..  a a a
B000063DFQ|5.0|Epic. Iron maiden's style was really put into this album. I have nothing else to say about this masterpiece. but, If you put it in a computer (Like with most maiden albums) You get a really cool menu lol
B007MNV5WU|1.0|it sucks i didnt even play it but it cost money on kindle fire but mostly every other device its free
B0002EXH4A|5.0|SFSGSW. One of the most epic metal albums I have ever heard. It mixes punk and metal into a epic combo. With their \\"Version\\" of Anarchy in the UK and the epic Into The Lungs Of Hell, This is awesome.
B007DIQB50|5.0|This cd is so good i love all the tracks i hope she tops the charts again. I cant wait till a third album is released. i want her to keep growing
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game. So much like Mario. Fun and simple. My wife and I take turns to see who can get through the levels faster. Good for all ages.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Finally a solitaire game that you never have to lose. With my Internet connection on, I can play in &quot;winning&quot; mode and know that the game is winnable, unlike typical play for this game. Not that the play is that predictable every time. Even in winning mode I have needed to replay certain games until I got the sequence of moves right. No frustration factor or antsy feelings anymore. The dances the cards do after a win are hoot to watch too!
B005K0HDGE|5.0|The story is a great combination of time travel and alternate history, well-written and well concieved. And reading it on my Kindle Fire was even more enjoyable!
B007BVOF8E|5.0|I found this a perfect spy movie for many reasons- not the least of which is to sit and be taken off to another time and place. I was a young man in the Seventies- no movie made for a long time captures the look of that time so well- it really is intricately researched yet seamlessly executed- it is not self-conciously \\"Seventies\\" at all. I read the book twenty years ago- people who whine in their reviews that this movie doesn't \\"get\\" the book should stick to it or the BBC TV series. This film stands on its own- sly references to \\"From Russia with Love\\" in the Turkey sequences- it makes it seem as if THIS was the reality that Fleming was trying to capture. Gary Oldman is perfect- frumpy yes but not too old and weird looking (as Guiness was IMO) to have that sad marriage to Anne. The sets are great- they make Britain in the Seventies seem a weird foreign country. If you are ever in the mood to sit and watch a spy movie this will not disappoint.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|you have to wait to build energy at times but other than that it ' great. you should give it a try.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Very fun and addicting not to mention Free!! My 3 yr old son loves to play tho he doesn't do to good yet I recommend it to everyone
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is a terrific game it can be ferry tricky though. a little hint click ont the dollar signs not the bones.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Although I heard some critical reviews of this app because of easily running out of energy I thought it added a strategy element that made the game challenging. I loved this game. It took me back to the old '90s Pc game.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Of Monsters and Men is definitely one of my new favorite bands! This CD was such a pleasure; I'm 100% satisfied with it. Their songs are great fun to dance to, or listen to in the car, or just leave on repeat for hours at a time. I'd say the best songs on the album are \\"Yellow Light\\" and \\"Lakehouse,\\" but in fact they're all terrific. This is one of the few albums that I can listen to straight through, without skipping over any songs. I am confident it will be the same with anyone who purchases it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is the best.  just like Mario but for the kindle.  I love it and everyone should get it.
B0072GPQNG|1.0|If your expectations for this movie were anything like mine were in expecting to see a horse standing out as being special in some way then please do yourself a favor and pass on this movie. At the conclusion of this movie I was left wondering what made this horse so special other than that it existed? There was certainly character interaction around and about the horse but the horse itself was not anything special. This movie was just about following a horse around through its various handlers with the key focus being on the current handler.<br /><br />In conclusion the only positive aspect to the movie was that I was able to borrow it from a friend who regretted purchasing with similar expectations that I had. Please... do not buy this movie. At best it is a watch only once movie and even then you might regret that.
B0064BWE8U|5.0|I have loved every Sophie Kinsella book and this does not fall short.<br />There are enough twists in the storyline to keep you entertained but it still flows smoothly.<br />The perfect book by my favourite author for reading by the pool in Bali with a cocktail in hand!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|cool fun delicious good game really amazing yolous fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun fun
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I must warn you before you read this review it does contain some spoilers. Mockingjay was one of the best books I've ever read. I read the first two books in this series within a week and couldn't wait to start reading this book. However I was slightly apprehensive beacuse many of my friends said that it was a disappointment, I counldn't disagree more. The book starts off with Katniss going back to visit the ruins of her home, district 12 after the Capitol bombed it at the end of Catching Fire. Mockingjay is heartbreaking from the beginning and, for me anyway, the reader can empathise with Katniss. As the story progresses, because the book is so well written, we feel Katniss' fear for Peeta, her fear for her friends who follow her lead as she brings them to the Capitol. This book is mostly about war and the rebellion that Katniss has become the face of and this book is not a lighthearted read. This book is more serious and more sad than the first two, but certainly worth reading.<br />The end for me was very satisfying...I don't want to give away too much, but it makes reading the book so worthwhile. This book is definately a roller coaster of a story and by the end of reading it you feel as though you were in Katniss' shoes and you feel exhausted, at least I did.<br />I would recommend anyone to read this book, because it is one of the best books ever written and many people would easily enjoy it.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love it. It's just like frontierville on FB. I play this app so much more. I have all apps that they put out all awesome. I wish I had more friends.
B0055SWM08|5.0|This game is quite fun, I bought it today so I would have it for vacation, and instead I'ge the better part of the day playing Quell.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|is fun like ur in a western. I enjoy playing this game<br />my daughter likes it too. we play it together.
B007DIQC90|4.0|I discovered this band listening to a free stream of their album and it caught my attention pretty quickly. They've been compared to Arcade Fire and I think that's a fair comparison. However, I also find that there's a thumping or driving nature to some of their music that reminds me of recent songs by The Head and the Heart. Lastly, their harmonies and catchy melodies remind me of The New Pornographers. The female singer sounds like a less-yodel-y version of Dolores O'Riordan from the Cranberries. There's a male-only series of songs on here that sometimes take on a Fleet Foxes kind of vocal (although not muted the way the production of their songs are).<br /><br />Comparisons aside, this is a collection of catchy songs with no dud in the bunch. It's not quite a 5-star album for me, but it's really solid. Some of the choruses are memorable, but the album really shines more so through good musicianship and good melodies. There are fewer hooks than some power-pop bands, but the album maintains a consist set of melodies throughout and that makes it a keeper. The album's first two tracks, \\"Dirty Paws\\" and \\"King and Lionheart\\" each have a well-paced and energetic feel to them and are stand-outs. Sixth track \\"Little Talks\\" features alternating male and female vocals and the most memorable chorus of the lot. \\"Six Weeks\\" follows and when paired with \\"Little Talks\\" there's a buoyant and delicious middle to the album. The ride to the end is still wonderful, made especially so with the sorrowful \\"Your Bones\\" and the sweet \\"Lakehouse\\".<br /><br />Iceland has produced much interesting music over the years, but this is the most welcome export I've encountered so far. The animal theme is carried throughout which really makes this feel like a complete album.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|what is their to say an alround good game its like Mario if he was Irish and loved gold keep up th good work
B0033PSH4U|5.0|A SEARING VISION OF CHILDHOOD AND EVENTUAL YOUNG ADULTHOOD UNDER THE MENTORSHIP OF THE HOOD LOCKED IN A NO WIN ROOM WITHOUT EXIT .... SOMETHING ALONG THOSE LINES.<br /><br />BRILLIANT DIRECTION, WRITING, CINEMATOGRAPHY AND ALL THE REST ... ESPECIALLY THE PAINFULLY TENDER MOMENTS BETWEEN FATHER AND YOUNG SON AND 'NOT HAVING' AND 'WANTING'.<br /><br />FRANCIS CAPRA as the young \\"C\\" is exceptional as the young child torn between parental loyalty and the glitz and gain of the \\"other side\\" ....... pity though that both actors in this role have not quite moved to something greater.<br /><br />Bobb D and Chazz P bring great power to their roles of father and mentor ... most chilling is perhaps Pesci's cameo towards the end of the movie .... quite a lesson in stark economy ~ not saying much but getting the point very much across.<br /><br />Something to be visited over and over again .......
B007PTJOV0|5.0|free and is like super Mario bros. fun and good controls. awesome graphics . best game ever!!!!! I like this a lot.
B006LQQ1GE|4.0|I was looking for some new music.  Intrigued by the song on the radio, and the excellent reviews, I bought the CD.  It can get tedious after awhile, but I haven't listened to it enough times to see if that's from a lack of familiarity with all the songs.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its all about a pep leperchaun like Mario thanks everybody oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is tons of fun. its not too challenging and its a great way to kill time. I can play for hours
B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome game.  just like Mario.  keep it coming. its a pertty good game and exciting game.  I play it every day when I get off work..
B0007M22TI|5.0|I have previously purchased and extensively watched, my four other Celtic Woman videos prior to finally buying Celtic Woman \\"The Original Show.\\"  Thus, upon watching this fifth video purchase, it was somewhat of a surprise to me.  I certainly have far more respect for Meav's singing abilities, now that I have seen her on this very first Celtic Woman video.  She came out so strong and confident in very charming Celtic songs like \\"The Wealthy Widow\\" and \\"She Moved Through the Fair.\\" It made her appear to be the lead singer in the show.<br /><br />I was equally pleased with \\"Ave Maria\\" being sung by Chloe, with those two harps as her musical accompaniment.  And although it may well have been Chloe's very first televised performance, she did an excellent job; and I look forward to a future Celtic Woman video; wherein she repeats this song to several harps. She is so much more confident and stronger in every one of her other video performances, so her repeat performance of \\"Ave Maria\\" would be much stronger and more special.  I also like her solos, \\"Nella Fantasia\\" and \\"Someday.\\"<br /><br />My all time favorite singer, lovely Lisa Kelly, did not disappointment me in any way, when she sang melancholy songs like \\"May it Be\\" and \\"Send Me a Song.\\"  It's further proof of her beautiful voice and singing skills.  I can't even imagine buying a Celtic Woman video without Lisa Kelly singing on it. For me, she is a must.  And finally, another song that I really enjoyed was the Celtic Woman version of \\"Orinoco Flow,\\" now that I can actually understand the words and places mentioned in the song.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Leps World is super fun and adictive. In a way it reminds me of Super Mario Bros. Although I wish it had more levels it is worth it to get!:)
0521675804|5.0|I have been using this book for over 20 years now and would recommend it to anyone! ESL teachers (as me) will find the explanations very useful to teach their students, and students will find both the explanations and numerous exercises helpful and relevant. A must for anyone willing to improve their grammar!
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Not great. Not bad. 101-in-1 Games has la decent variety of games. However, quantity is not quality and you will spend a few taps between every other game or so getting past ads. Also - one of the tasks to get points is to write a review, so...

B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it. reminds me of Mario. very easy controls. hours of fun. just my speed. great graphics. give me more.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|great game it is very addicting me and my wife just absolutely love it.  keep up the good work on making great games five stars all the way
B00785P2QC|4.0|it takes a while to rack up money and investment points, but over all its fun. the tapping everyone complains about isn't a big deal at all,  just add to the interactions.
B004UXUUDA|3.0|The movie is good even though I thought La Raffe (The Roundup) was a more moving take on the same subject.<br /><br />I saw the movie on DVD in French with English subtitles because I enjoy getting the feel for the actual language spoken as opposed to a dubbed movie and I was appalled by the pathetic mistranslations from French to English.  Many of the English sentences make no sense at all.<br /><br />It's disgraceful to release a major movie like this and not have a competent English speaker check that the English captions are correct.  Was this the work of Google Translate? How much of an investment can that be compared to the overall budget for the movie?

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|on the kindle it froze it so I had to power it off all the way and then it takes a while to take it off the kindle fire.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you enjoy Mario 1 for the nintendo, then you will like this game. Its simple and fun. Hit blocks and collect coins kind of game.
B005CM9DX6|5.0|I was hesitant to purchase this album due to the polarizing reviews it's received. I'd heard it would be completely different from anything they'd put out to this point, and eventually my curiosity got the best of me and I went ahead and snatched it up. What a pleasant surprise! It IS different, but not at all in a bad way, IMO. There's no death metal here and if you're looking for it, just go away already. \\"Heritage\\" should be approached as a prog rock/jazz fusion album, but with that familiar Opethian stamp found in the mellow/acoustic sections of past releases. \\"Devil's Orchard\\", \\"I Feel the Dark\\", \\"Haxprocess\\", \\"Famine\\", and \\"Marrow of the Earth\\" are all highlights. Five resounding stars and props to Opeth for leaving those whiny, insular metal elitists in the dust.
0345803485|5.0|I think this book was awesome... I cant wait for the 2nd book to be delivered!  I think i am alittle addicted and I only got the book yesterday and I am almost done!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|fun little game ..it is like mario..don't like the review process...twenty word minimum ..come on..cheese and rice..I want some corned beef and cabbage ..or maybe lucky charms
0439023521|5.0|Well, what can I say what hasn't been said yet..? Nothing. And yet I can't stop myself from singing Suzanne Collins' praises on Amazon cos I liked it that much! Recently saw the movie as well and liked that too. Be sure to buy this one if you like dystopian novels with romance in it. Another one in this genre I liked was 'Delirium' by Lauren Oliver.

0385486804|5.0|A long time Alaskan when they first found Chris and published his diary in the Anchorage Daily News, I found the book to be accurate on both the technical and emotional level. It clearly explored the drive that brought many of us up to Alaska in the first place. I was a woman traveling alone in the winter in the 70's, thought as crazy. It also expressed the exaspiration that many experienced ALASKANS felt on first reading his story of the lack of preparation and research. Not acknowledging that we ended up there without any either. He was that something special in all of us and had he survived, he would have learned what not to do next time. There is a bit of Chris in all of us and Jon's personal experience acknowledges that.
B0068RHGJM|5.0|[[ASIN:B000URDEB0 Dark Passion Play]] was the beginning of a new era of Nightwish, but the scattered nature of the album's tracks and the disappearance of the original female lead was a turnoff to most older fans. Comparatively speaking, Anette Olzon's first works seemed a bit unpolished across DPP, as if two music styles were butting heads on the tracks. This was not particularly bad, per se, but for a purist it can be a heartwrenching turn of events. For the rest of us, it was an interesting development, and not cause to write off Nightwish at the drop of a hat.<br /><br />Any such pretense of mixed styles or mixed messages died by track two of the newest Nightwish album. Imaginaerum takes all the strengths of the new female lead and plays them for every ounce of power possible. Anette proves she can do the slow operatic pieces that made Nightwish stand out under Tarja, and she can do the powerful pieces in a more upbeat mood as needed for the faster tracks. I gauge her flexibility to be at least equal to the original female lead, but on a different range of vocal pursuit than Tarja. This is not a bad thing, but a different application and the rest of the band has duly compensated to make it work very well. (NOTE: Marco can still do the power metal vocals in his typical fashion, and the rest of the crew are still in top form. No complaints whatsoever for they.)<br /><br />More to the point, the entire album plays on one long story from end to end, and not an entirely happy or dark story at that. Listening to it straight through will give a listener an acute case of mood whiplash, especially going from track by track throughout essentially the whole album. The entire track 12 is a four-part mood whiplash in one movement, with some interesting social commentary at the end. Opinions will be mixed on the accuracy of such things, of course. Two instrumental tracks (7 & 13) give a good occasion to listen to the major instruments without vocals for those who like the lack of lyrics.<br /><br />Effectively, this album is something for everyone for the Nightwish non-purist. If anything, I would say that Tarja moved farther away from Nightwish in her own pursuits (Her solo albums [[ASIN:B00133KDM8 My Winter Storm (U.S Version)]] and [[ASIN:B003VOP7KK What Lies Beneath]]) than Nightwish departed their own selves in their new albums.k of lyrics.<br /><br />Effectively, this album is something for everyone for the Nightwish non-purist.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I have to say I bought this book because I saw it on the cover of my Entertainment Weekly and thought it was worth a shot.  In less than a week I have now read all 3 books and couldn't put them down.  Yes it could have been written a little better, but I was taken by the characters even with their flaws.  By the second book I was more interested with the characters then I expected to be.  I have to say I recommend this book--even with it's flaws and all.  Good stuff.  Now I plan to reread them (slower this time) and catch some of the stuff I missed since I was speed reading my first go around.
0061726834|5.0|I love love love this author! She already had me hooked with her previous novel Before I Fall, and this one didn't fail to deliver either. I'm a bit disappointed that it's a trilogy (I think she could have wrapped up the story in one book without giving me the feeling that there was much more to be said - why does everything have to be a trilogy nowadays??) but I loved this first installment to death, at least. Society has been brainwashed in such a way that people believe falling in love is like a disease (delirium nervosa) so everybody gets a treatment that will leave them emotionally dead, more or less. The main character is starting to question this treatment when she meets a boy who is clearly different from the others, although he seems to have had the same treatment as everyone else. Yet there's also her mom's suicide (because of said disease) that keeps her on her toes. After all, who wants to die a sad, deranged lunatic because of love?<br />Read this book, you won't be disappointed. I thought it was kinda like 'Fahrenheit 451 for teenage girls', and I think Ray Bradbury is the bomb.
B005VTS4EY|5.0|I LOVE this game!!! the only problem is that I'm stuck on level 30. I wish you could either skip levels or watch a tutorial of how to pass that level!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so fun.  I cannot stop playing.  reminds me of super Mario bros.  if you ever liked nintendo and want a free app like super Mario bros.  this is for you.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is great on my kindle fire.  I love games like this and its free can't go wrong with that.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Loved every minute of this first in a series books.  Read all three in a week.  Even had to see the movie the first weekend it was out!
B007IXWKUK|5.0|Again, couldn't put the book down.  I think I carried my Kindle with me everywhere I went, which is crazy because I have never read a book that would fall into this genre.  Great read and this book made me fall in love with the characters even more than I already was.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love this game even though it is copying mario but if its the only thing out there Ill take it!
B007MNV5WU|1.0|Can someone please tell me why Kindle Fire Owners are the only users being charged for this new app? To be nice I think it is completely EFFED up. Why do you hate my kindle fire??
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I loved this book and that is a little disquieting to say the least.  From the first chapter of Book One until the last word in Book Three I was held captive.  I found my hands shaking at times and became very nervous at others.  My reactions while reading this book manifested themselves not only in my brain but in my emotions also. I was spellbound.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|see this app is just like Mario... I love it and I'm so shocked that its free. apps like these are so awesome.
0670022950|5.0|The meticulously researched, carefully reasoned and well written 800 pages put across how violence has decreased with the advance of civilization. An extremely hopeful book, it restores your faith in the human race. Totally recommendable. One of the most important books I have read.
0062082353|5.0|This is probably one of the best books I have read.  Kyle is a true bad ass soldier!!  This book opened my eyes about the war and what soldiers go through.  A truly spectacular book.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Not a bad game. Great play. I love the way it carries on from the original. Might need a little more quests with more action involved.
B003U4XS8Y|5.0|This is a great show, and I have Amazon Prime so I watch it for free. So pretty much I'm giving this a 5 star on how it should be rated *cough cough*.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a good game but to get free updates u have to rate it five stars. I think that a game should earn five stars not ask for it.
0545265355|5.0|Bought the boxed set to take on vacation to read on the beach...I had never heard of the Hunger Games until a few months ago and got totally \\"caught up\\" in all the hype! I was vacationing with a large group and everybody was lining up to read the books!
B004FEJ3VY|2.0|This toy is not worth the money at all. I have purchased much cheaper models that were much better<br />than this one.  It does not transform at all and an arm broke off when my son was trying to transform it.<br />It is nice if it is just going to sit on a shelf to be looked at. The durability was good though- it<br />is made of hard plastic and the colors were nice.
0553582038|5.0|When first I read the amazon reviews for this book I was devastated, I had to read it anyway, I did not came all this way to the fourth book just not to read it. To my (happy) surprise the reviews where all wrong!!! Yes, this is not an action pack book like \\"A storm...\\", but is still a great book. It´s all about characters you love to hate, or hate to love, if you love Westereos, you we´ll love this book, trust me. It doesn´t matter than the \\"big war story\\" is not moving forward, it´s a fun ride anyway. Now moving into a \\"A Dance...\\", hopefully the reviews are wrong again...
B007J4T2G8|1.0|After hearing all the buzz about this book and even seeing it on the cover of my favorite magazine \\"EW\\", I decided to plunk down a rare $9.96 for this book. I love a good erotic novel, or even a bad one, as long as it doesn't cost too much money, but this one was not very good at all and cost a lot of money. I understand that these were originally fanfic stories based on Twilight, but how transparent can you be?? Of course you have the Christian=Edward and Ana=Bella, but the rest of the characters are just as obviously ripping off (and poorly) on Emmitt, Charlie, Renee, Alice, Esme, and Carlisle. Ana as a character is very hard to relate to since she is graduating college, has never had sex (much less an orgasm by herself), seems exceedingly naive, and gets sucked in by a man who she continually refers to has \\"stalker tendencies\\". The writing style of the author was choppy and stunted to repetitive phrases such as Ana blushes, she bites her lip, she rolls her eyes, and that terrible, interminable \\"inner goddess\\" that made ME roll my eyes every time I read it. The BDSM aspect of it was actually pretty light considering other things I've read and it should have played a bigger role considering how important the author tries to make you believe it is to Christian. There is more to BDSM than being overprotective and overbearingly jealous, which is about all you see from him. The other thing that bothered me was the constant emails between Ana and Christian that you are forced to read as part of the dialog. It got very tedious after the first few, but it continued extensively throughout the book. The best part of the book was when I finished it and decided not to bother with the other two in the series. My biggest gripe about this book was the price. I wouldn't have felt so strongly if I had only paid less than $4 for this on my Kindle, but the caliber of writing and storyline are just not there to justify the higher price tag. I would not recommend this unless the pricedrops DRAMATICALLY.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|good times. love how it evolved into such a great game. keep up the good work guys .it can only get better
B0054JZC6E|5.0|Lots of mini games. Earning points to get to the next mini games can be tedious, but the games are ok. Never crashed.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|This is a great game.  it reminds me of the old game i used to play as a kid but this one is much more fun.
0440237688|5.0|Frequently cited in lists of great young adult novels and named as a favorite by many people, The Giver is a coming-of-age story set in a dystopian, authoritarian future.  As one of the 100 most frequently banned books in the U.S., it may not be appropriate for children and young teens, but the messages of individuality and freedom make it a worthwhile read.  The book's aesthetic appeal is limited, probably because it was written to be understood by a young audience.  If your favorite books include Orwell's 1984, Bradbury's Farenheit 451 or Rand's Anthem, you will probably appreciate The Giver, although it lacks the depth and dimensions of those great novels.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is really fun. you run out of energy fast but its not that big of a deal. other than that no complaints.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I read the first book in the series at the request of on of my teenage daughters.  I have acceded to this type of request with mixed results but must say in this case it was an excellent recommendation.  Even though the target audience is young adult all three books provide a excellent reading experience with an exciting plot, excellent character development, etc.  Having seen the recently released movie I strongly recommend reading the books FIRST.  The movie is much better with the books back stories in your head.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|With this app not only do you get to choose the version you know and love, you get the opportunity to choose from a wide variety of reading/study plans to start your day in God's Word. Choose to read through as little as one subject or through the entire Bible in a year! You can highlight verses just like a real book. Awesome choice.
B005XI4CX0|4.0|This was an interesting watch. I wonder if they ever find out who A is? Alison comes across as arrogant and powerful. Also, a bully....
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this game is the bomb. I really enjoy it. very good details.  could have somemore thing happen though. could have some more explaination on things that u can do or how to do it.
B004P8JPS6|4.0|This was Reacher's last assignment as an MP officier in the Army.Very clever plot that keeps you guessing up to a surprising and very satisfying ending.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|just as addictive as farmville.  the quests are fun and not impossible and I like thati dont have to keep begging people to help me with the quests. I definitely recommend this.

0446585025|2.0|First of all I love Ellen.  Her show is great and I always love her humor.  The first few pages made me laugh out loud, my family immediately knew I had started reading her book.  However, the jokes got boring.  The style became too monotonous.  I started losing interest in less than half the book.  I was very disappointed so now I'm not sure if I want to get the other books.  Don't want to be disappointed again.  I guess I will stick to just watching her show and her commercials......even those were more entertaining than the book.  You are an awesome person Ellen - a great humanitarian and I still love you, just didn't love the book.
B003QSMCKO|5.0|Ok for all you people complaining about it not being exact to the true Mulan story *rolls eyes*, it's a Disney interpretation! It's going to be altered and changed a bit so CHILL! This movie is fantastic, has a very memorable Mulan who's struggles anyone can relate to and the music is breath taking. Loved it almost as much as Tangled.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game. easy controles I love it!!! I regimens this game to any one who loves games like these. I love this game
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game definitely has that old school Super Mario Bros.feel from the original Nintendo. The controls are simple and do a pretty good job of mimicking the pressure sensitivity of a NES controller from back in the day. The best thing I think that this game has going for it is the pricetag. Free. 'Nuff said.
B0073XORLU|4.0|I have listened to the entire TAAB2 once online;  I am a Tull fan....and I wanted to write a review for this...then I read a couple others; I was curious about the 1 star reviews.<br />I agree that much of Tulls creations over the past 10-20 years has been uninspired HOWEVER there have been many glimpses of brilliance.  I have seen them live also; most recently 2 summers ago.  & I liked the show although it did seem it was just a collection of shows.<br /><br />As for This album: cd; whatever (what do we call them now): Ian's voice sounds MUCH better than recent efforts live and studio...musically, it sounds very much like old Tull to me.  So far I have really enjoyed this...I will listen more & revisit.  It seems that there is a mixed bag of reviews, but most seem to like it.  Count me in with the group that really likes it.  I would really like to see this genre come to life again & I believe that this c.d. could lead the march....but that's me.....If you like Tull, it is DEFINITELY worth a try tho.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|so much fun...good distraction while on the subway. just like being 10 again playing Mario bros. for hours after school.
B005LRWRZ8|4.0|I love Megadeth, but it hasn't been since \\"Countdown to Extinction\\" since I've bought an entire album. Megadeth just got a little too timid it seemed and I moved on, though all the while loving the classic 80's-early 90's albums from the band. After seeing the \\"Behind the Music: Remastered\\" on Megadeth, the broadcasts of the \\"Big Four\\" on VH1 Classic, and Dave Mustaine on \\"That Metal Show\\" I looked into the new album. I viewed the video for \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\" on youtube, and dug the song, so I bought the album from Amazon. The album is a welcome return to the sound of the band circa \\"Rust In Piece\\" and I loved it! The song \\"Public Enemy No. 1\\" rawks and works well blasted in the car on the highway. Another song is \\"Whose Life Is This Anyway?\\", but I will admit the reason it didn't get 5 stars is that most every other song other than perhaps \\"Sudden Death\\" are all album cuts, not singles. That being said, you can blast the album without having to run to the \\"skip\\" button. I think this will have me look at the more recent albums like \\"United Abominations\\" to see if they are on the same level. Keep it up Megadeth!! Rock Lives.
B004G600A4|5.0|I have watched this movie over 10 times and it still hasnt gotten old. Its special because Disney put a lot of thought and comedy into the \\"typical\\" romance and made the characters realistic and relative. Ever 2 seconds I would think to myself, \\"thats exactly how I act!\\" XD It was just the most adorable movie and I will treasure it and pray that Disney continues down this path.

B006PTZNSY|5.0|Ok so first let me say that I reeeeeeeeeeeeeeally didn't think Roman Reloaded was going to be better than Pink Friday BUT I WAS WRONG!!!! I loved Pink Friday so much that it was hard to see Nicki topping that, especially with all the singles from that album topping all kinds of charts and it doesn't seem like it's happening for this one, I could be wrong. Nevertheless, Pink Friday Roman Reloaded is FIYA!<br /><br />Now, let me remind you that I AM NOT a hip hop/rap person. I don't really listen to it therefore, I don't buy it but Nicki catches my attention and I like her personality. I listen to her in interviews and while I may not agree with everything she says or does, I think she is different in a good way because I always find her trying to encourage young girls and speak positive things regardless of the situation *but I am here to reverse the curse that they live in-Nicki*! I know ppl talked about the fact that pink friday wasn't 100% rap but thats what I liked about it the most. NICKI CAN ACTUALLY SING and I respect the fact she incorporated all her skills in the album to give it diversity. With that being said, I listened to the samples of Roman Reloaded and thought, ohhhh snap! I'm getting this! So I'll do a track by track review for u guys cause these are the types of reviews I like to read myself:<br /><br />1) ROMAN HOLIDAY: Definitely an intro type of vibe. Love it<br />2) COME ON A CONE: The title makes me laugh but the track is hot! Definitely should be a single.<br />3) I AM YOUR LEADER: Cool track! She brought out Cameron on this one and they worked well together.<br />4) BEEZ IN THE TRAP: Another hitter! I actually would've liked to hear only Nicki on this one, but its all good. The hook is definitely catchy so U will definitely be singing this in your head.<br />5) HOV LANE: Nicki sets it straight in this track as to what lane she is in. A good track!<br />6) ROMAN RELOADED: Reloaded indeed, lol! Fiya!<br />7) CHAMPION: My second fav song off the album. Gives u a Moment 4 Life and Here I am vibe. Love it.<br />8) RIGHT BY MY SIDE: OOOOOOMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGG! MY FAVORITE SONG OF THE YEAR!!!!!!!!!<br />9) SEX IN THE LOUNGE: Smooth track, a nice transition from the top half to the bottom half of the album.<br />10) STARSHIPS: Sings it all the time. Love it!<br />11) POUND THE ALARM: Makes you wanna get up and dance, love it!<br />12) WHIP IT: Another dance floor banger! Love it!<br />13) AUTOMATIC: U will automatically like this song!<br />14) BEAUTIFUL SINNER: Blends well with the 2nd half of the album!<br />15) MARILYN MONROE: An emotional side of Nicki emerges in a Pop kind of way! Like it!<br />16) YOUNG FOREVER: Love this one, beat gets u bumpin from the start!<br />17) FIRE BURNS: Definitely feel the emotion in this track, love it!<br />18) GUN SHOT: This is my least favorite, just wasn't feeling this track at all!<br />19) STUPID H*E: This one is just ok to me, nothing too special.<br /><br />Regardless of the couple tracks I disliked, the whole album stays on repeat. I absolutely love it. As you can see, Right By My Side is IT for me, lol! I love that song to death. I love how Nicki gives us a lil bass in her voice, then a lil kick, then a lil English accent, then a lil singing...I just love the variety she delivers, it's never the exact same. So I give it 5 stars cause I am all for one who can give me some good music to rock out to and I found it in Pink Friday: Roman Reloaded! God bless!album. Gives u a Moment 4 Life and Here I am vibe. Love it.<br />8) RIGHT BY MY SIDE: OOOOOOMMMMMMMMGGGGGGGG!

B007PTJOV0|5.0|awesome? I really enjoyed it. just like Mario bros. takes a little getting used to with the controls but very easy overall.
B005NNVPOO|3.0|Not too sure who these remasters are aimed at. Is it for a new audience and more revenue or a real attempt to improve things? I am so disappointed with this version as the gutsiness and rawness of the original has now become what sounds like a radio one live lounge set

God's word right here always teaching me more with just an app.

0060558121|4.0|I picked this book up after reading \\"Coraline\\" and \\"The Graveyard Book\\" by Neil Gaiman. Gaiman's handle on the skill of terrifying the reader before they even realize it was phenomenal and both \\"Coraline\\" and \\"The Graveyard Book\\" were perfect parts creepy and exciting. When I picked up \\"American Gods\\" I believe that I was, for some reason, expecting that very same thing.<br /><br />What I got instead was a story full of horror that is deeper than the idea of having buttons sewn into your eyes, or of having some demon shadow men trying to kill you and your whole family. The horror was human-kind in general and the adventure was discovering that there's so much more to life and the world than what meets the eye.<br /><br />Gaiman's characters, Shadow and Mr. Wednesday, are the focus of the book. The gist is that Mr. Wednesday is dragging Shadow all around the place getting him to do the strangest, and sometimes most stomach wrenching things.<br /><br />The reader will meet the Gods of old, dressed in their modern day bodies, sewn seamlessly into a world that passes them over without a second glance. But that's the problem... the world is forgetting them. The world is ignoring them. People are finding new gods to worship. Money, fame, technology. The new gods are tired of sharing their space and are ready to start a war to put the old gods to rest, permanently.  The old Gods are none to happy and Mr. Wednesday (you'll be surprised to find out who he really is) is rallying the troops with Shadow's help.<br /><br />This story was very demanding of my attention, and I don't think I wasted a spare minute on getting it read. I will say though that Neil Gaiman also does his best to make the reader uncomfortable, and I was uncomfortable on numerous occasions throughout the book. But that made it all the more riveting!<br /><br />American God's is very intelligently written, full of references to Gods that you've probably either forgotten about or never knew existed. You mythology buffs out there are going to be guessing wildly about who Mr. Wednesday is. I was. I had a few ideas, one in particular, and I was half-right.<br /><br />Anyway, very gritty, quite creepy, and in some cases just plain bizarre. But I love books like that, don't you?logy buffs out there are going to be guessing wildly about who Mr. Wednesday is. I was.

B000002UB6|5.0|You gotta love an underdog.<br /><br />Though perhaps a misnomer to speak of any Beatles record in such a way, 1970's Let It Be nonetheless fails to resonate with many of the Beatles faithful in the same way that their other albums do.  Arguments range from the loose, essentially live playing style sounding sloppy and underproduced to Spector  unnecessarily excluding certain tracks from the final product while overproducing others. Won't someone make up their mind?  Whatever the reason, Let It Be is often casually dismissed by those who felt that the album failed to reach the heights of the greatest rock records ever recorded.  I suppose when you grew up during a time when 67's 'Sgt. Peppers' was followed a little over a year later by The White Album and then Abbey Road in '69, one's expectations are somewhat skewed.<br /><br />Perhaps it's because I came from a different generation that I feel a profound sense of attachment to this record.  As a child of the 80's, I was bombarded with mascara and artificial noise which was poorly disguised as popular music.  That I sought solace in Thrash Metal and Jim Croce (I'm seeking counseling) was perhaps indicative of the fact that, at my core, I craved honest, organic music.  Let It Be has that in spades. The brainchild of Paul, the 'Get Back' sessions were intended to unite the four men who changed the world under a single banner by forcing them to be a band again.  Indeed, from the microphone John and Paul share on 'Two of Us' to John's incessant joking which bookends several tracks, Let It Be sounds like an album recorded under the best possible set of circumstances.  Sure, history has taught us otherwise but therein lies the problem.  Courses are taught on the history of this band at Universities.  It's simply impossible for some to disregard the fact that the Beatles shelved these songs in favor of Abbey Road, or separate the implosion of this band from Let It Be.  However, taken on its own merits the plaintive, appropriately bluesy feel that permeates Let It Be showcases a band that was, in the end, still the best band in the world.<br /><br />Abandoning many of the studio techniques Martin and The Beatles pioneered, Let It Be approaches the recording of an album in the same way the band did with every album up through Rubber Soul.  Clearly adoring Richards and the Stones by this point, Lennon and Harrison in particular are gloriously vulnerable on \\"Across The Universe\\" and \\"I, Me, Mine\\" respectively.  The former, a holdover from the Abbey Road sessions and partly inspired by his first wife's \\"nagging\\", is a piece of infinite cosmic dispassion in which Lennon repeatedly declares: \\"Nothing's gonna change my world\\".  Ironically, by the time Let It Be was released, something had.  The later, a Harrison track which restores the tempo of the record, juxtaposes Billy Preston's dreamy organ and an acoustic guitar in the verses with Harrison's almost gristly, amplified electric in the chorus'.  Though Harrison was right that his best work never got a fair shake from Paul or John ( My Sweet Lord should have been a Beatles song), his selfishly titled offering during the Get Back sessions is a \\"second rate\\" song for the ages.<br /><br />Joining the seemingly inexhaustive list of deep Beatles tracks, 'Dig a Pony' and 'One After 909' are any other band's singles.  John, ever his own worst critic, would dismiss 'Pony' in later years as one of his throw away songs.  While his nonsensical lyrics in the verses may be just that, John unleashes the full range of his voice on the chorus, climaxing in a falsetto that touches the end of his range before cascading back down to open the next verse. 'One After 909' is fun in the way 'Twist & Shout' or even 'Obladi Oblada' are fun and is nothing more than a pleasure to listen to.  A relative relic by Beatles' standards (this track dates back to the early 60's), where it may have gotten lost as an odd duck on the pop-heavy 'A Hard Day's Night', here the up-beat Blues track feels right at home.  Nothing too fancy, just a well placed smile before Paul's second ballad on the record.<br /><br />\\"And now we'd like to do: All The Angels Come\\".  Only The Beatles could get away with introducing Paul's greatest gift to rock with John wasting tape.  And yet somehow only The Beatles could have made it work.  John's introduction to Let It Be so disarms the listener that the instantly recognizable opening piano chords take the listener by surprise and conjour the memories and emotions each of us has attached to this song over the past forty years.  Yes, Harrison's guitar solo on the album is inferior to the single version but the integrity of Paul's achingly expressive vocal and Preston's warm organ accompaniment is not compromised in the least.  Dropped almost haphazardly in the first half of the album, 'Let It Be' was destined to become the Beatles last opus and, had they known that, maybe it would have been moved to the end of the record and without John's foolishness.  Thank God they didn't.<br /><br />Still in that vein, Let It Be can be thought of as an album of inclusions and exclusions.  John's \\"Don't Let Me Down\\", though released as a single, certainly had a home on this album.  Spector's orchestral and choir arrangements did not.  Easily the most legitimate and universal complaint with this album, Paul rightly removed much of Spector's meddling on the 2003 \\"Naked\\" release.  'The long and winding road', with its orchestral and choir arrangement, has the effect of placing a late 60's/early 70's time stamp on a track that needed no flourishes.  And yet, having heard this version for so many years, the \\"Naked\\" version can sound sparse in comparisson.  Yes, I'm going to have it both ways.  Where this album succeeds in additions/flourishes is the inclusion of Billy Preston.  His organ playing is such an integral part of Let It Be (and later on Harrison's solo records) that it's no wonder there was a legitimate conversation about making him the 5th Beatle.<br /><br />Of course they didn't and Let It Be served as The Beatles' curtain call.  Blame the strength of Plastic Ono Band, McCartney's eponymous debut and All Things Must Pass. Had those records flopped Let It Be might have been little more than a brief lay over; the 7th inning stretch for a band that released music the way rabbits do what rabbits do.  No one would have begrudged The Beatles a break, except maybe the band members themselves.  The only thing The Beatles may have had in greater supply than brilliant songs was the energy to write and record them.  Regrettably, Let It Be suffers the fate of bearing witness to a band that just couldn't keep it together anymore.  Don't you dare call it a death rattle.  In a world of records that are artificially assembled on a computer as much as they're written and recorded, Let It Be offers a window to a time when even the greatest of studio bands could still (mostly) come together, jam and bless us with one last moment of brilliance.p-beat Blues track feels right at home.

B0054JZC6E|4.0|Most of these games are like the ones I like to play online when I'm bored. Sometimes the controls are kinda cruddy and the ads can get annoying but the games are SUPER FUN!
B004MC8CA2|4.0|I like it. has great options! only thing is I get lost selecting my plans sometimes. can't do multiple plans at once
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is a fun game to play I love it it is so easy to play.I. would recommend. this game
2090338628|5.0|I bought one of the used copies, excellent conditioning, a 10+ pages with writing, grabbed a giant eraser and made it brand new again.  Great book, instructions are straight-forward.  Big fan of the entire CLE International press series.
B004EBT5CU|5.0|Adele is such a great singer full of emotion and this album does not disappoint.  Every time I hear one of her songs it draws out such feeling inside.  This is such a refreshing artist from the world of cookie cutter singers today.  If you haven't bought this yet, what are you waiting for?
0143119680|5.0|The book is about a witch named Dr. Diana Bishop, a vampire named Matthew Clairmont and a magical text.  Despite Dr. Bishop's attempts at avoiding magic at all costs, an enchanted manuscript comes into her possession attracting the attention of Mr. Clairmont as well as a host of other supernatural beings.  It is soon discovered that Diana is the only one who can unlock the secrets held within the valuable text.<br /><br />Great, crisp writing easily transports you into the world Harkness has created.  The historical and oenophile aspects are enlightening and adeptly showcase the author's extensive knowledge of wine and history (she is a history professor and writes a well-received wine blog).<br /><br />I love the main characters as well as the supporting cast of witches, daemons and vampires.  Despite being about 600 pages I flew through this book...such a fun read!  There are elements that are somewhat Twighlight-esque - i.e. forbidden love, vampires and other supernatural creatures; yet, the comparison stops there.  The author has a distinct and intelligent voice and it is nice to finally see a non-YA book cover the paranormal (I'm sure there's more out there...this is just the first in my reading experience).<br /><br />I recommend this to readers who gravitate towards academic settings and to those who enjoy books with a historical element.  This novel is the first in a series and I can't wait to find out what lies ahead for Diana and Matthew!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is addicting, fun, and a great time waster!!! just like Mario, but with pots of gold and a leprechaun. awesome app for all ages, no doubt about it.
B007DIQC90|5.0|Great album. If you have never heard of them but enjoy Mumford and Sons, Decemberists, or Death Cab for Cutie.. you will like this band.  I can listen to this over and over. I fell in love with Little Talks which made me want to purchase the cd. So glad I did!
B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I used to love this game as a kid. but I have had this for an hour and now its glitched and all of my businesses and animals are stuck at 107 hours to finish my money. I don't know how to fix it.
B003H9MSPG|2.0|It says 35 ft on box, good luck with that. I bought these guns for my boys, they are getting into the nerf gun thing. My problem with these are they dont have the power it says it does, I did research and found a bunch of modifications for these??? Really? You shouldn't have to mod these, these should be good to go out of the box. Just my opinion. Overall they're ok. I bought them the hand guns and they seem to shoot better.
0756407125|5.0|When I finished this chunkster I discovered that I could actually fall more in love with this story than I already had with the first novel.<br /><br />It's amazing how much Rothfuss' books completely transport you into the world he's created.  These novels truly hold a little universe within their pages.  I sighed heavily when I saw that only 100 pages remained to be read...I didn't want my time with these characters and this world to end.<br /><br />One of the aspects I love most about Rothfuss' books (and seems more pronounced in The Wise Man's Fear) is the stories-within-a-story.  There is much more tale-telling in the second book of The Kingkiller Chronicle and all of the stories were just delightful (my favorite is the one about the boy with the gold screw in his bellybutton).  I also loved that you got to explore more of the realm in Kvothe's world.  Rothfuss takes his hero to exciting and sometimes surprising new places and the reader finally gets to discover some more of the dramatic events behind the legendary tales of Kvothe.<br /><br />This book also made me feel even sorrier for the elder Kvothe who seems to have lost his way.  I wonder how the last installment of this series can possibly explain all that must have transpired to lead him to become the innkeeper called Kote.  How does Bast come into Kvothe's life?  The shadow of war and unexplained evil looms over the story...what's going to happen??  So many questions to answer in the last book...I can't wait to read it!<br /><br />I can't recommend this series enough!  I've pushed these books onto everyone I know - including those who don't normally read fantasy, and all of them have become enamored with these amazing stories!
B006ON41FC|5.0|it is an addicting, fun, and not to mention hilarious. I love it. so worth 99&cent;. if you want to have something to do on a rainy day, buy this app. its awesome
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game pis really cool and I think it is great. I have always wanted them to put Mario on as a app and this is like that
B0052GACNM|5.0|Can Tony Bennett do anything wrong?  Absolutely not.  This CD is stellar.  Tony Bennett is certainly singing his typical classic style. I was pleasantly surprised with the performance of a number of his duet partners.  I was unfamiliar with some of them and now I'm considering the possibility of checking their CD's.  This CD is a \\"must have\\" if you love Tony Bennett.
0761169253|5.0|I love this book so much that I've been carrying it around in my backpack since I bought it 3 months ago.  To me, it elegantly supports Einstein's quote \\"everything should be made as simple as possible, but not simpler.\\"  Poignant, aesthetic and to the point.  It raises points that seem like they should be obvious, but somehow are not.
1439102813|5.0|What a compelling and heartbreaking book!  The last several chapters of the novel I spent with steady tears on my face.  Despite the crying, I really did find that Still Alice had some wonderful uplifting moments and is filled with hope even when faced with the tragedy of this terrible disease robbing Alice of her mind.<br /><br />In a few reviews there was some talk of the inadequacies of Genova's writing.  I would have to disagree with this criticism.  While I would agree that Genova is no Leif Enger, I think her plain, sparse prose was perfect for this book because it allowed the focus to solely shine on Alice, her family, and her disease.  This novel would be a great choice for a book club as there are a myriad of scenes and themes that warrant discussion.  I read this in the span of a few hours and cannot recommend this book enough!
B0036T31YY|4.0|I don't have a lot of deep things to say regarding this movie, except that it is VERY cleverly written.  It pulled me in and by the middle of the movie, I was so enthralled that I had to see it all the way to the end.  I was left asking myself at each point, \\"Is this where she stops it?\\"  I also kept asking myself, \\"How many times has she been through this?\\" Again, a very cleverly written movie.
1594202842|5.0|I loved this book. First of all, I was raised by very free-thinking, question authority kind, spoiling kinds of parents. When my mom died when I was 21, I was totally clueless and unprepared for the world. Not to mention, my mom always let me quit things when they were hard and never pushed me to finish projects. I was also a total underachiever in college. I totally regret not practicing the piano when my mom paid for me to take lessons and my piano teacher evenutally told me I was wasting her time. Then I gave up trying for a second time in college. Total regret. Then I completely spent more time partying in my private college than studying and have forgotten most of what I learned. Another regret. If I'd had a mom like Amy Chua, that wouldn't have been an option and I might be in a different place in my life and I think more people should think like she does. Parents aren't there to be their children's friend. They are there to prepare you for life and what better way than demand 100 percent effort? These girls haven't turned into serial killers or drug addicts and while they might've had to do some hard work, what's the problem with hard work? The mass media and all those coddling parents out there totally gave this book a bad rap. I say kudos to the tiger mother for her strength and perserverence. Also I'm currently dating someone who was a single father and he and his sister raised two of the most spoiled lazy girls I've ever met. A 13-year-old who doesn't know how to properly wash dishes and expects to be shuttled to and fro to her friends house every weekend. The 10-year-old's never done a chore in her life and can't entertain herself to save her life. Not to mention she leaves her clothes on the bathroom floor and doesn't like to wear clean clothes, brush her hair or put sheets on her bed. Cleaning her room is a battle and never gets done right. Even in my lassiez faire household I was made to clean and be hygienic. The world needs more tiger mothers and parents like Amy Chua. Otherwise people grow up to be lazy, unproductive idiots who have no ambition, no drive and no vision of their own futures. I wish I could send her my child to raise.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it. it is very much like Mario. Cute leprechaun character. Controls are a little fussy but easy to get used to. I definitely recommend this game if you like Mario-type
B0011ZYNZQ|5.0|This album and this band are simply Brilliant.  You have to hear it for yourself.  Buy the \\"2 from the vault\\" series from Roadrunner which comes with Effigy and Pierced from within together in one combo pack. Seminal records, each albums are astonishing in their own right.  Get the 2 for one.  Can't recommend these enough.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I'm not sure why all the negative reviews for this one.  I was a bit nervous to finish because I did not want to be disappointed, but alas book three did not let me down.  To tell the truth, I liked Mockingjay as much as the other two - and definitely more than Catching Fire (sorry, my least favorite of the trilogy).  So, don't be afraid to start the series thinking that you won't like the way it ends.  Read the books and decide for yourself.  As for me, I thought the whole series was fantastic.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|This is one of the BEST books I have read in awhile. It is hard to find an ADULT book that gets you excited to go home and read! I couldnt put this down!
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I loved this series. I ended my HBO subscription before I saw the last 4 episodes and was devastated. Lol. The DVDs were cool, came within a few days of purchasing them, and were packaged in a nice box. If you're a fan of this series, you should invest in it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very fun. exactly like mario. I thought the Mario style game was over but I'm happy u brought it back.
B0063GORYU|4.0|It adjusts to your ability with one or more suits.  Remembers where you left off when entering the game.  I enjoy it.
B006RUJST6|5.0|I have no words for this book. I loved this book, I mean I have favorites but this has to be a all time favorite. I laughed, I cried, I was angry and I was in love. Such an amazing story...this deserves more like 10 stars! You have to experience this book for yourself-a must buy!!!
B001DF68MA|4.0|Item is Good, Well made and light.Almost perfect. Bad thing it's for small kids. My daughter loves it . But My 2year old daughter fits snug and tight in the chair. She's a Tall little girl. It will probably wont work for us when shes 3-4 years old. Hopefully by then she learns to ride her bike. :)
B005CA4SJW|4.0|I was pissed that this series was only 5 episodes. But before I got to that realization, I enjoyed each and every episode like no other and I was immediately hooked! I kept hearing about \\"walking dead\\" on tv but checked in late. I purchased this after the second season had already ended. I CANNOT WAIT to see the second season on DVD and catch up. This is an amazing series and with all the crappy tv series out, thank the heavens someone has produced an amazing series w/ action, suspense, and horror! Even with now knowing its only 5 episodes, I'd still purchase it again! GREAT SERIES!!
B001UDPAB0|3.0|I guess my wife had seen \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" in the theater some time ago and was greatly impressed. As such, she found this Ocean's Trilogy (11, 12, 13) and insisted that we get it. Well, I've now viewed, reviewed and rated all three movies.<br /><br />All of these movies have high production values. These are not cheaply made movies. The filming, sound, pace, star actors and everything was good. Even some of the acting wasn't too bad, although I got tired of watching Brad Pitt feeding his face. The original \\"Ocean's Eleven\\" was a reasonably good movie and provided interesting viewing in the manner of the old \\"Mission Impossible\\" episodes. The two follow-up \\"Ocean's Twelve\\" and \\"Ocean's Thirteen\\" movies were failed attempts as sequels and not worth viewing. That's just my opinion.  There are Ocean's fans who love them all. So what might my advice be? Unless you're an Ocean's fan, save your money.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B007PTJOV0|1.0|First... learn English..... Second... proof read your product description before you release.  And finally, again to the devs, enjoy his fine garbage you created.
0802473156|5.0|This is an excellent, short, readable book that is beneficial to any couple no matter the current status of the relationship.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|Everyone from young kids to grown adults have fun with these games. My daughter and I like to see who can get the better score. It's so fun.
B004LROUNG|4.0|An excellent story by an excellent story-teller.  Vintage Grisham.  Once you start this book, you can't put it down until you're done.  It's not great literature;  but it is a great read.
B0052GACNM|5.0|Beautiful CD  Tony Bennett and the various artists could not have been any better<br />Each song was unique and beautiful on it s own
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game does remind you of Mario Bro. so if you are looking for a free, fun and time wasting game...here it is! I love it.
B005K17RU0|4.0|Okay don't get me wrong this disband great app. But thee disband problem where I live its 9:45 pm and it says like 9:08 am I want to know if you can change the time on it. As I said there is only one problem that's the time.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it just buy it it is worth it also energy goes down but do not mind it just please buy come on.
B0018QOIXU|3.0|I first encountered Adele through an online video of her cover of Dylan's Make You Feel My Love.  I was entranced, and bought this album on the strength of it.  She delivers the song with a childish innocence and vulnerability.  There is something wonderfully seductive (at least to an English ear) about the way she enunciates the final syllable in \\"wouldn't\\"... \\"...nothing that I would-unt do...\\".<br /><br />I have to say that that track is the best on the album, although it is overall very listenable.  My first impression on hearing it through was that she was a nicer version of Lily Allen, with a better voice and a far, far better attitude.  For me, that's a big plus, but if you actually enjoy Allen's attitude, you may find Adele's lyrics too soft and sentimental.<br /><br />The opening track, Daydreamer, contains too many vocal tricks, and she forces herself off-pitch in the upper register.  Fortunately, those tricks are confined to that opening track, and for the rest of the album she reveals a comfortable range, with a warm tonality throughout.<br /><br />This is a soulful, pleasant rendition of some rather average songs, with some genuine emotion, plus that unforgettable version of Make You Feel My Love.<br />[PeterReeve]
B00246VKGG|5.0|I bought this DVD to show to my students during the Holocaust unit. I downloaded the extra items and was very impressed. It will go with the book. I would recommend this DVD.
6305754969|5.0|This was in great shape. This is one of my favorite movies, so was glad to get it at a good price.....^i^
B0054JZC6E|3.0|this is a great game if you want to play the same games for hours. you have to play the same games over and over to accumulate enough points to unlock the rest. this game would be better if all 124 games were available at once so you can find what you like best. overall ok but I wish I could access the other games sooner.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|I took a star away because u have yo make ur own pointsto play other games on it but other than that I love this game!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B000002OZY|5.0|I tip my hat to Peter Townsend, great songs, great album, great group.  I've been listening to this non stop since I purchased it and I'm amazed at how talanted each of the band members are.

B00729GQ0A|4.0|*Received e-book through the Early Reviewers program from LibraryThing for an honest review<br />**more like 4.5 stars; also posted on Goodreads under leannessf<br /><br />The Forever Girl: Sophia's Journey is told by the point-of-view of Sophia Parsons, a 22 year-old Wiccan, who is under persecution from the religious Mrs. Franklin and her new convert, Sophia's own mother. As she struggles with the townspeople's stares and gossip, she suffers from a constant hissing in her ears that won't go away even with the spells she casts. If that wasn't enough, she finds herself the object of interest of a strange group when her friend, Ivory, takes her out for a fun night clubbing, and ends up being chased by a fanged attacker. Sophia is thrust into the supernatural world of elementals and shifters and she must figure out her unique role in it before getting killed.<br /><br />Hamilton succeeds in entering the already crowded market of young adult paranormal romances/urban fantasy with her own unique story. I admired the plucky, yet vulnerable Sophia and her efforts to understand her family history, while contending with her introduction to the supernatural/elemental world. In addition, I was captivated by her involvement with the mysterious and at times, hilarious, Charles and both their efforts to resist the other. I enjoyed how their dialogue and actions rang true to their characters, much unlike other romances that can feel rushed and inauthentic. I also thought the supporting character, Ivory, was well flushed-out and Hamilton cleverly unfolds her role in Sophia's journey to the surprise of the reader.<br /><br />Overall, I was stunned by how good The Forever Girl was - it was an entertaining, fast read with unexpected plot twists. Although the ending felt a little rushed and abrupt, I am definitely looking forward to reading the next book in the series. I would highly recommend this book to teen and young adult fans of paranormal romances such as the Twilight series byMeyer and the Hex Hall series by Hawkins.
B000U0O9FM|5.0|I've seen the movie before reading the book, but even then, there are so many things I didn't catch from the movie. This is one of those books where I just can't put it down. I can't seem to read it any way other than in Edward Norton's voice, after seeing the movie, and hearing him. That's not really a downside, just an interesting side to it, I think it gives it more depth. Great read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its so much like Mario!!! Love love love it!!! You get all the action of Mario bros. but in a different version!!!
B004SJ3BCI|5.0|i love this game alot it is a good game for us kids to play beacause it a fun and alot of fun game well you guys should play it......its really fun
B007MNV5WU|4.0|It is a pretty fun game but I think it can get sort of annoying sometimes. But if you like weird challenges its great for you.
B003Z0BWT0|5.0|I love this series of books. Soooooo easy to read and so enjoyable. Each book is just as enjoyable as the one before. I stumbled across this series as it is so different to what i normally read. Now i cant wait to start on the new one.
B0018QQQK8|5.0|I absolutely loved this book, I see it is going to be a movie, I can't wait to see it. I love Nicholas Sparks. I have read or seen all of his books, he is a wonderful writer. I love the way he makes me feel like I am seeing all that there is to see. I can't wait for his next book.
B0061S073A|4.0|With this App I can safely hand my Kindle to my 3-year-old. She only has access to the Apps and functions I choose, and can't accidentally buy something or open the browser or change settings... she can't even adjust the volume on her own!<br /><br />Unlike other Apps that serve a similar purpose, this one does not need a WiFi connection to work, doesn't tease your kids with services that aren't included without cost, and it allows you to set your own password as opposed to simple-to-figure out preset unlock codes. The only reason I give this App 4 stars instead of 5?<br /><br />1. It's clunky, and there's no easy way to allow access to saved content (like purchased movies, music and books).<br />2. It's irritating that the functions provided by this App aren't part of the Kindle Fire's programming already... I know that has nothing to do with the App, but... seriously! Why is this App necessary?<br /><br />For anyone with little ones though, it is... it is necessary... get this App if you EVER plan to hand your device to your kid! (also, get a sturdy case and a screen protector!)
B003ES61EE|4.0|This is a great item at a good price.  The only somewhat bad thing is that the cap sometimes has a hard time staying on.  I haven't lost the cap yet but I am afraid I might.  However, the brush works well and I like the fact that it is retractable.
0439023513|5.0|I don't understand all the criticism of this book. It was not a fairy tale. As with the other two books, \\"Mockingjay\\" was a totally<br />engrossing book that one could read in a day but one wants to savor over time. Like another reviewer, I cry in movies but rarely when I read a book. This was an exception, I did cry when I read \\"Mockingjay.\\" I highly recommend this book. Now I'm waiting for<br />Suzanne Collins to write the prequels.
0807014273|5.0|If I had to read only one book in my life, this would be the book. This book taught me that howsoever bad a circumstance, it surely can't be worse than being in a Concentration Camp for no fault of oneself and even in a situation as bad as a concentration camp, one can keep one's hope and sanity
B004G6009U|5.0|I have to say that I had my doubts with this movie.  All the reviews and critics loved it and said it had a great story line that not only engaged the ladies in the audience but had plenty of action and tongue in cheek humor that kept the guys interested as well.  I think that this is a five star movie because it has something for everyone.  at the end of the movie, you are left feeling satisfied and wanting to see it again.  I hope you give this movie a chance as it is a great flick for family movie night!
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|This was my least favorite book in the trilogy. I LOVED the Hunger Games and was really looking forward to the last two books. Alas, I was a little disappointed. Catching Fire was a good read with interesting twists. Mockingjay was okay. I'm glad that the reader finds out what happens to the main characters. I wanted to know more about what happened to all the character that I grew (sp?) to love. The character development just wasn't enough for me in the last book but overall, I recommend the series.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I read this book in a few days (spending a few hours each day) and felt that it was well written. It is an easy to read book, and all of the dialogue and events were effortless to follow. Some feel that the book was too violent or brutal, but I didn't find it too disturbing even as a young adult book. I read the book in preparation for the movie, so my review won't be covering any new ground.<br /><br />I can see how the cast of the movie fit each of the roles. While reading, I could picture Jennifer Lawrence as Katniss, for instance. I guess one could argue this is bad, because you're supposed to imagine the character based on the author's description. I just imagined Peeta as a weakling that was somehow very articulate in his speech.<br /><br />The one thing I didn't understand is how the Capitol is able to bio-engineer new lifeforms, but is unable to bio-engineer faster growing crops that could sustain all 12 or 13 districts? They seem to have really advanced medical technology as well, but leave many of the districts starving to death or to be led by an oppressive local government. The Capitol has force fields, but the districts have electrified chain link fences. The disparity in wealth and technology is quite extreme.<br /><br />Overall: 5/5 stars. It's well written and easy to follow. I'm anxious to watch the movie now, and I'm already reading the second book.
B005H29GSI|1.0|We love the Angry Birds video game, and everyone can play it with no difficulty whatsoever.<br />When we saw this game we thought this would be a great alternative to the video version. In theory it is but the poor construction of the pieces makes it \\"Extremely difficult\\" to set up the way the cards would have you build the forts.<br /><br />The \\"wood timbers\\" are hollow on the edges so you are left trying to stack 2 or 3 pieces on tiny edges. Even if you manage to get the thing set up it had better be on a rock solid platform as the least little vibration will collapse the structure.<br /><br />If the pieces had solid edges making them easier to stack and more stable this would be a very fun game.  As it is I cannot see how anyone could enjoy this thing. Mine is going back. It's not worth the aggravation and frustration of trying to keep the target structure built so that the game can be played.<br /><br />The construction materials of the game itself are OK and would seem to last a long time, so I will give them credit for that. If it were not for the poor design of the stacking pieces this could be a very enjoyable game, but it is NOT.<br /><br />In short a waste of time and money.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I love it! so similar to the classic Mario games :) I can play this game for hours. so glad they made a game like this. I recommend anyone to get this. and for free? awesome :D
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me of super Mario bros. very addicting. very fun.  love it. different levels. highly recommend. you shoot acorns at enemies.
B0059XTUVI|1.0|Interesting take on one of the most powerful (and polarizing) persons of her time. M. won the oscar, but I feel it was for politics not the body of work. Also more in bad taste to attack someone living in such a manner.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game. it makes you think and you can really interact. with it unlike some games where all you have to do is click..
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game was super super very very super very a lot a bunch whole lot very super very super awesome
B002QNBRXS|5.0|I got the DVD sooner then I thought. It was in great shape.I will order again as always.I also have now order Dexter season5 and I'm waiting for that.
0345803485|1.0|what a pile of drivel this book was. I cannot believe all the 5 stars seriously people?<br />Christian- can't stand him he is the most unlikable character I think I have ever read about.<br />Ana- can't stand her...if she bites her lip what more time or talks about her \\"inner goddess\\" I am going to projectile vomit!<br />what is sexy about some man who won't even let you to have a drink with your friends when you are only 22 years old?<br />what is sexy about a man who controls every single solitary aspect of your life including what you wear, who you talk to, where you work, who you work with, when you can drive your car...and so on and so on. I couldn't have been any less turned on while I read this book. I actually found myself saying things out loud like \\"oh give me a break\\" and \\"are you kidding me\\" while reading it.<br />If I could tell everyone I know not to read this book I would.  The only reason I read it in the first place was because my book club picked it and I cannot even wait to trash it in book club.
B0063IH60K|5.0|works well, not buggy, good way to while away spare time. effects after winning are amusing and simple. good app.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|i loved this book so much. it moved me to tears. you will love it. leisel rudy papa max and all the other characters were so real and i never thought someone could write something so touching andmoving. i am so happy i read this book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Its a pretty fun game...and its just like Mario :). Nice way to pass the time when you're bored and its free!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|fun game reminds me a lot of pioneer ville or farm ville its not like the old school oregon trail I grew up with but fun
B005K17RU0|5.0|Does and excellent job easy ti use and very accurate. Reccomend it very much. Would get again in s heart beat.
B0042VJ1PI|5.0|After getting hooked on the TV show and getting all the older seasons from our library to really understand the progression of the series, it's interesting how the books have many things that have been in the TV shows.  Of course, even though the names have changed it's visual reading since we see the characters on TV.  Nicki and James have a better relationship in the book then on TV.  That's all I'm saying if you haven't read the books yet.  I'm about to get book 3, and book 4 will be released later this year.  YEAH!  Please keep them coming.
B001E45XT4|5.0|A little bulky but light weight. as expected via reviews, initally the fit was overly tight but has already eased up some. sound is great; a surprising improvement from my previous set of walmart logitecs. settings for the microphone for games required adjustment but works fine.
1612130283|5.0|I must admit I was skeptical when I first heard about this book. I normally do not read books of this nature. I like mysteries, action books, etc. Im not one for romance novels or love stories. But, the controversy of this book peeked my interest. I had to see what all the hype was about. I was pleasantly surprised! It was a Fabulous book! Once you start this book, you will not be able to put it down. For those who are shallow minded enough to think this is a smut book, you are sadly mistaken. I thought the book was so much more than the sexual relationship between the two characters. What an awesome job she did writing this book! You fall in love with the characters and how they interact with one another. The correspondence between the two via e-mail is a hoot. I caught myself smiling on many occasions! I think this is a must read! I have the other two books in the series on order and can't wait to read them.
B000VI6T6K|5.0|These people were honest and a pleasure to deal with, i would have no problem dealing with them in the future!

B005K17RU0|5.0|It is an excellent app with all sorts of features that give you accurate weather predictions. The weather readings are really clear to tell you what it will be like.
B0041KKYBA|5.0|This is a well-made video that explains how the unrestrained insanity of Wall Street led to the global financial meltdown of 2008 in terms that all can understand. Unfortunately, it doesn't explain why there's been no action taken by the government/regulators to prevent future disaster. The reasons are fairly easy to surmise: MONEY, GREED, etc.<br />I wish everyone would watch this video.
B0060YIBLK|5.0|It has been a wonderful book, and I can hardly wait to try out the techniques.<br />This is almost an engineering level for how to talk to people, and how to get them to talk to you, especially the latter.<br />But the kindle is a bit awkward (well I am new to it)<br />I would like to get the physical book, but feel that I purchased it already.<br />So I will start over and read it again.<br />Anyway it did open my eyes to many things.<br />I would recommend Social Engineering by Christopher Hadnagy as a companion volume.<br />http://www.amazon.com/Social-Engineering-The-Human-Hacking/dp/0470639539
B0032UYFA6|1.0|*SPOILERS*  Alert to morons - If you are one of those people who goes berzerk when your favorite show is criticized and feel the need to lash out with accusations that only stupid people don't see it the way you see it, just move on and don't bother wasting my time by responding.<br /><br />I was completely blown away by season one and two.  Where the show started to go wrong was the end of season two, where Walt watches Jesse's girlfriend die.  Yes it's all very artsy fartsy for the writers to focus in on Walt's face as a tear slides down his cheek, watching a young girl die without trying to help.  Oh the \\"complexity\\" of characters who make \\"complex\\" decisions so as not to bore the audience with the expected.  Aren't the writers oh so brave?  For me it didn't work because A) I didn't believe that Walt would do that (there were other options besides letting her die that wouldn't have blown his cover), and B) Even if Walt didn't know her and we are supposed to accept that he did it because he thought she was dangerous to him and Jesse, I, as the viewer, knew she was basically a good person who wanted to turn her life around, and it wasn't fun watching the character I've been following just stand there and let her die to save his own ass.  Not a fun way to pass my time.  No thanks.<br /><br />Even though I was not pleased with the above scene, I decided to keep watching, but I absolutely quit watching after the scene where Walt's wife figures out his secret.  The whole reason that Walter decides to cook meth in the first place is to provide for his family after he is gone.  A baby is on the way, he has a disabled son, his wife does not have a job...  It makes sense that a man with nothing to lose would do what he did for his family.  The fact that he would stand there like a doofus with his mouth open (a look that had been irritating me since series one) and let her walk out the door without saying what any reasonable real-life human being would say - \\"I did it onlybecause I thought I was going to die, and I did it for you and the family\\"...  When he didn't do that I knew the writers' egos were now steering the ship, trying to be clever and \\"complex,\\" at the expense of believability.  Then someone told me that the wife sleeps with her boss to get back at him...  Yeah I think I'll pass on watching a family I cared about, that was making truly complex yet BELIEVABLE decisions disintegrate into a torturous mess.  I'm not going to give my time over to a show that is unbelievable AND depressing.  I call that a waste of time.  Yea, these characters \\"break bad,\\" and I break wind in response.<br /><br />By the way, Tuco and Uncle Tio were awesome.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a good free marioesque game.  the graphics are good and fun and I have no complaints about the gameplay.
0545265355|5.0|After finishing the first book, I just had to have the other two in the Hunger Games series. This wasn't the best price, but it was super speedy delivery and arrived in perfect condition, so I was pleased.
B003XF1XOQ|3.0|After falling in love with the first book and finding a lot of positive things about the second, the concluding book in the trilogy left me stranded.  I didn't care about the characters anymore.  With so much collusion, trickery, and deceit, I simply lost interest.  Who wants to kill whom and why?  That gets really old after awhile.  The first book was stunning.  I was drawn into the morality and sociology of the concepts, etc.  But the third book is just trying to make sense of paranoia.  Not a strong ending for what could have been brilliant.
082300659X|5.0|All of Juliette Aristides art books are excellent, but the DVD in the drawing book was especially informative and personal.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|I am not a big fan of the angry bird franchise,  but I found that this game sparked immediate interest. it has amazing graphics and excellent controles. the challange level increases as you progress and you will find yourself stuck in many places. while there are not enough levels to amount to the price, you will have fun with the uniqueness angry birds space has to offer. but you may want to wait until it comes down in price.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a easy and fun game devs did a great job cant help to think I have played it before though but with a plumber wearing a red hat trying to save a peach or toadstool.
0446547654|3.0|I'm a big fan of Nicholas Sparks.. I actually have all of his books. But this time, I felt slightly cheated.<br />First up, there's lots of similarity to 'The Notebook' in the plot, with the two main characters coming together after a long time apart.<br />Second, although the bond between Dawson and Amanda is described convincingly enough, it is a little hard to believe that Amanda never goes to the cemetery after their weekend together..<br />Also, the final part of the book, in my opinion, hinges on too many coincidences, almost like a set of dominoes toppling over. Dawson forgets Tuck's letter, and goes back for it, only to see the doctor's ghost who leads him to the Tidewater where Alan Bonner is being beaten up by two of Dawson's relatives. Dawson saves Alan, who is the ghost doctor's son, only to get shot in the head. By chance Dawson is an organ-donor, and the timing is bang-on with Amanda's eldest son needing a heart transplant.. Too many coincidences, too improbable..it's a bit like Amanda accusing Frank that he is responsible for his son needing a heart transplant, because he set the whole thing in motion..<br />I'm not sure at what point the reader is meant to make out that Dawson was the donor for Jared's heart, but I began to suspect something along these lines BEFORE Jared had the heart attack.. maybe because with Sparks' style, it's something we've come to expect.<br />I found this book too sad, and heavy.. there isn't any light along the way... Dawson's haunted by his unrequited love for Amanda, living the life of a monk; haunted by the memory of an accident where through no fault of his own someone died. Amanda on the other hand has let her parents decide many things for her, where she should go to college, whom she should see. After twenty years of marriage to a man her parents approved of, she's gotten to the point where the temporary blip has become a daily occurrence, and she's sad about it.<br />Combined with the fact that Dawson and Amanda are brought together by Tuck's death, Dawson's childhood full of abuse and cruelty, Ted and Abee's sick, sadistic pleasure in hurting others, it fails to raise even the ghost of a smile.<br />Also, Marilyn Bonner releases Dawson from his guilt over her husband's death, but somehow, the doctor's ghost keeps haunting him, with the express purpose of getting him to save his son... getting Dawson killed in the process..<br />I found this element improbable... another way how Dawson is used by those around him... his father uses him as a punching bag, and ATM machine, his girlfriend uses his love and then forgets about him, even when they meet up again, it is obvious that he is the one who loves more in the 'relationship', just like Frank is the one who loves Amanda more than she loves him in their marriage. Not such a likeable person...this Amanda, is she?<br />And finally the ghost uses Dawson to save his son... implying that going to jail when he was innocent, putting flowers on the doctor's grave, and actually sending most of his money to the doctor's family - all these are not enough; the only way to lay the doctor's ghost to rest is for Dawson to give his life for Alan Bonner..<br />NO, I did not particularly like this one.
B0063IH60K|5.0|Surprisingly complex for a free little app. Enough variety to serve as an excellent diversion in airports/plane &amp; auto rides.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its a great game and its sort of like super Mario bros game but in like a lepricon world that's why they call it leps world my point is its a great game for ages 4-104!!!!
B005MYWZIO|3.0|I really wanted this album to amaze me. I believed it would. I pre-ordered it based on the strength of the EPs Michael Kiwanuka had been releasing prior to his full length debut. Songs like \\"Tell Me A Tale\\" and \\"I'm Getting Ready\\" (both featured on the full-length album as well) sounded like new classics to me and I was very excited to hear a full album from this artist. Unfortunately, for me the album does not live up to the promise of these tremendous songs.<br /><br />The album starts strong with the songs I mentioned then kind of pitters out after that. There are a few decent tracks, some nice melodies and such but nothing nearly as strong as \\"Tell Me A Tale\\" or \\"I'm Getting Ready\\". The album feels unbalanced. I find the vast majority of the tracks on this album to be a bit too slow and meloncholic. Slow tunes are fine but there needs to be a more substantial counterweight. This is of course based solely on my personal taste, some people may totally dig these tunes, they're just not for me.<br /><br />One song that is noticeably missing from this album is \\"I Need Your Company\\". This is a great Kiwanuka tune that was released on an EP. A song like this would add some needed pep and balance to this sleepy collection. I'm surprised it was not included especially since the album is so short at only ten tracks.<br /><br />As problematic as I find this particular release, Kiwanuka is a big talent and I look forward to hearing much more music from him in the future. I selfishly hope that he'll go with the more invigorating, uplifting direction he appeared to be heading with \\"Tell Me A Tale\\" and \\"I'm Getting Ready\\" more often.

B007PTJOV0|4.0|fun. just like Mario bros. only no down button to go into tree stumps or whatever would be the pipes in Mario. still fun.
0985114606|4.0|Gideon is a powerful, wealthy man used to getting what he wants with no questions asked.  Eva is a woman determined to lead a successful, healthy life on her own terms.  When Gideon feels a strong attraction to Eva, he wants her at any cost, even if that cost is his carefully pieced together life...<br /><br />Talk about a dysfunctional relationship.... I have to admit that I was completely absorbed in this book, despite the fact that I normally do not like hot and cold relationships.  Gideon and Eva are both victims of abuse, and when they find they are inexplicably drawn to each other, their relationship proves tumultuous, powerful, frustrating, and beautiful all at the same time.  While they both have managed to recover and be successful adults (individually), the relationship status throws each of them completely out of their element, and they both find that they are not as recovered as they would have thought.  Gideon is a very dominant male, he likes control and power.  Eva is the opposite, she is terrified of losing control.  However, Gideon's control and powerful ways melt away some of the harsh memories for Eva, and she finds herself opening up more and more, which terrifies her.  The results are a very rocky relationship, neither knowing what to do or how to cope.<br /><br />As I said, normally I do not like hot and cold romances.  However, in this case, there are REAL justifications behind the off and on again changes.  As I got to know the characters, I understood why they acted the way they did, and why they were so afraid of love.  On one hand, you want them to work their issues out, but on the other, you hope that they don't hurt each other even more by trying to make it work.  Either way, the result is an enthralling story that I did not want to put down.<br /><br />Sylvia Day does such an excellent job detailing the dynamics of this relationship, there is no way the story can be told in just one book.  But still, I was very surprised when the book ended, I was simply not ready to quit reading.  It was the type of ending that had me searching through the e-book, looking for more and sighing when I realized that I would have to wait for book 2.  The ending is not really a cliff-hanger, but the story is far from over.  So, readers be prepared to be left wanting and itching to discuss everything that you have read.<br /><br />Bared to You is not a happy, whimsical romance story.  This is a story about a relationship with a gritty, rocky road to romance, high on sexual content, and so enthralling readers won't want to put it down.  I have to issue a warning, as the characters are victims of abuse, some readers may be sensitive to the content.  Also, the sexual content is graphic and not appropriate for readers under 18.  With that said, if you are a reader who likes gritty, erotic romances, you will really like this book.  I recommend this book to fans of dark, erotic novels.<br /><br />*I received this book for review*nded, I was simply not ready to quit reading.

B002L4QP0M|1.0|I found this to be slow moving, confusing and boring. The characters were uninteresting and the book just didn't grab me. For these reasons, I didn't finish reading it. So perhaps I'm not the best person to write a review. Nevertheless, that's my opinion.<br />Ron W

B000M5AJQS|5.0|Perfect DVD set~love it! Fast shipping, great seller, would recommend. This movie is the best mafia movie since The Godfather, you will be riveted until the very end. THANKS~
B004UXUUDA|4.0|The movie is very faithful to the book on the big picture.  The acting and the filming were very well done.  Some of the nuances between the people were not scripted in, and while I know that happens in many adaptations, there were those parts that I missed as  I felt it would have made the movie even more powerful.  It is not just another holocaust movie, and one that does tell of things from a fresh perspective.
B00062PN6I|3.0|Nice sound and the fact that it comes with two plugs is a plus. They are cheaply made and feel very flimsy.
B007PTJOV0|2.0|The controls suck.  He jumps too high.  Yeah its looks like Mario but its no where near as fun. Don't waste you time with this app.

0765348276|5.0|For too long I've lamented that much of modern SF hasn't got the draw of the SF I grew up with in the 60s and 70s. It was just somehow off-putting. I had resigned myself to re-reading my older SF and awaiting the occasional book by Niven to keep me entertained. However, Old Man's War was just the tonic to my worry regarding lack of new SF reads that I'd enjoy. It is an easy read that keeps you interested from beginning to end. I've since read additional books by John Scalzi and even began reading his blog, which is just as entertaining to read as his books are. I hope there are many more tales coming out of John's mind. I'm sure I'll enjoy each, and have so far.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|If you like original Mario you will love this. easy to play and addictive. There buttons are all in the right place for ease of game play.
B007P3TMW2|3.0|Since others have reviewed the storyline and content, I will omit most of that here.  I thought 10 years would be enough time for me to watch a movie about the 9/11 attacks...but it wasn't.  To explain, the young actor is exceptional, which makes his heartache and despair very painful to watch, especially in the last 30 minutes of this movie. If you were too young to remember 9/11, this may be a good movie to see and understand the emotions of those who lost a parent or loved one in the 9/11 attack. But because I wish my wounds to stay healed, and the fact that I wish I had never watched it, I can't recommend it.

B000002KKK|5.0|As I noted in RIO GRANDE MUD review of a recent date, I played this album and DEGUELLO back to back for a while for a comparison.Consistently good and consistently innovative is just part of why ZZ-TOP made it huge as a great band. The playing on this album is sonically, harmonically, and definitely emotionally, charged and powerful. Track 3, 5, 8 and 9 are all stand out music power, but that is great amongst some superb material. The key change in DEGUELLO is the bands consistent tight feel being topped with amazing vocals, bass, and a huge step towards their soon to be definitive sound.Track 3, not new to me, I'M BAD I'M NATIONWIDE, is a great super stomp. Track 5, new to me, but wow, Manic Mechanic has great sound, guitar, bass, and some of the definitive humour that only ZZ-TOP possesses. Track 8 is a cross between Jerry Lee, and Little Richard, done in only the manner that ZZ-TOP can produce, howling wolves indeed. And of course, the Ultra, mega, super duper classic CHEAP SUNGLASSES on track 9 has the crowd yelling and screaming for more, and thats exactly the direction this great band went. They took their time to define, but never left the heart of true music for the massess by bringing them along hearts and all. DEGUELLO is a key step, and a classic one, on the road to the bands super future, and the musical and spiritual uplift of all rock, blues and louder than loud fans could ever want. Buy this gem now !!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|The Hunger Games was so riveting that it didn't get cold before I ordered the next book, Catching Fire! Readers should be forewarned that it might be a little too brutal for some.
0307592731|5.0|I couldn't put this book down. It's the best book I've read in a long time and I read a lot. The author is very open about how your life can spin out of control without warning, you can make bad choices, and more importantly, that if you give yourself a chance you can pull it all back together. It's a take time to look yourself in the face, laugh, and get up and brush yourself off type of book. It's good to be honest with yourself and she does a great job at showing it's O.K. to screw up. We all do it, we just don't admit to the public. Thanks for a great read. I can't wait for your next book. I guess we all STRAYED sometime in our life. Buy this Book !
B004GHNIRK|5.0|Great book, delivered to my Kindle.  Spent many enjoyable hours immersed in this great tale about the lives of the peoples of France.
B005V20JKI|1.0|I instaled with the aneroid app store to get the update but it wouldn't let me play at all.  very mad!!!!!!!!!!!
B007MNV5WU|3.0|some of the levels are really difficult.  You keep trying and you don't get it until like the 20th time. It is fun at some points but not at others.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book by Anita Moorjani was so riveting, that when I learned she would be speaking in San Jose, CA I made immediate plans to see her in person. Even though I'd purchased it on my Kindle, I purchased another book to have her signature. This is a must read for anyone who even questions that there is life after death and the possibility of healing.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm part of a book club - I tend to get exposed to a lot of books I normally wouldn't choose off the shelf, and this is one of those books!  There is a review in Entertainment Weekly that labels it as a 'modern day romance' and at first glance, I ask myself 'Does the average person perform some of these BDSM activities in the bedroom and it's just so hidden?' because I certainly do NOT and consider myself pretty average!  But once you get past that aspect of the series, and realize that both the characters are flawed just as all human beings are, it helps move past the fear of the erotic sections of the book.  I think the author does a great job of portraying the magnetic pull that Ana and Christian have together.<br /><br />I finished Fifty Shades of Grey and because I'm a new Kindle Fire owner, loved that I could start the second book Fifty Shades Darker INSTANTLY!  I'm about 75% through the second, and will move right into the third (Fifty Shades Freed) when it's time.<br /><br />I recommend this book (and to go a step further, the series)to anyone willing to step out of their 'comfort zone' as I did.  And yes, the erotic scenes are hot as hell!
B00127RAJY|5.0|I think this is a great workout video. It only takes 20 minutes and it isn't easy but it is so worth 20 minutes per day (I can't handle daily at first, but I will work up to it!)  I don't have a lot of time so I highly recommend!

B003Y5H51K|1.0|It's generally a good sign that when a big name producer/director is tagged to a movie with a \\"Presents\\" or \\"Produced by\\" line that something is amiss.  Shame on Cameron for this pathetic marketing grab.  I cannot fathom how this man felt this movie would help his reputation.<br /><br />Sanctum is a terrible movie experience.  I found nothing redeeming in this mish-mash of movie cliches and horrible wastes of money.<br /><br />1.  The acting is atrocious.  Everyone is over-acting or just failing miserably in every sense of the word.  Not only is there a sheer lack of talent here but they show absolutely no conscious ability to even remotely get into the situation they are supposed to be in.  However this is due to two larger issues as well.<br /><br />2.  Embarrassing writing.  The screenplay for this film is a giant steaming turd.  The characters are all unlikable.  Not a single one has any redeeming trait.  The film basically moves from one terrible movie cliche to the next.  We have the pouty teenage boy rebelling from his famous explorer dad, the over cocky no fear rich guy with his snotty out of her league girlfriend, the abrasive father who pushes too hard, and the sage sidekick with some ironic ailment for the job he is doing.  Everything in this film is predictable and the writers didn't seem to care.  Whats worse is the pathetic attempts to generate drama are insulting.  The father son quarrels and bonding moments a midst a major disaster are just ludicrous and had me literally cursing the screen.<br /><br />3.  Directing.  The director got nothing out of his actors here and most likely was incompetent to do anything different.  The actors had no flow.  One minute they would be screaming and crying, the next minute they are smiling, joking around and taking pictures like tourists.  This is not just bad acting, it's bad directing.  Clearly the actors were losing their sense of direction from a broken up shooting schedule.  The director should have kept themin the moment but failed to do so.  The main character is this no name teenage boy whose basic range of acting is grinning like a moron to squinting really hard when trying to cry.  Just pathetic.<br /><br />4.  Cinematography.  The main character in this film was supposed to be the cave but the combination of terrible camera work combined with shoddy CGI just made the whole film look terrible.  Half the time you couldn't see anything because the cameras just couldn't catch the action.  Camera angles and positions were poorly chosen and I suspect budget concerns didn't allow for many reshoots.  Later on in the film they give you wide angle shots of CGI caves that are so far back you can't make anything out.  Much of the film has you starring at a rock wall with no clue where you are supposed to look.<br /><br />By about halfway through the film I stopped caring if these morons made it out of the cave alive.  Perhaps most insulting was how it climaxes.  There was no story, just some cheesy disaster film thrown together with no direction and a lot of bogus cheesy film cliches.  Waste of time and money.  Don't even rent this one.  It only encourages them to make more of this trash.  Shame on you James Cameron indeed!

B000HC2LI0|5.0|I absolutely love this show and I will argue until I am blue in the face with anyone who thinks this wasn't one of the best shows ever written. So of course when I saw this box set I had to have it. The box set not only includes every minute of this epic show but looks great on display as well.

B003O86FMW|3.0|I read Hunger Games and liked it. After finishing that book I downloaded book 2. I launched into it but by the time are heroes were back at the Games again I found that I was paging ahead to see if the seemingly endless gaming had an ending. It was getting repetitious. I was losing interest. It just happened. I finally went to another website and read a summary of the book. That's how I finished it. I'll probably give book 3 a go regardless. By the way, this happened to me with Harry Potter years ago. By book two I was done and gone. The writing was beautiful but the story was repetitious. It lost me and I lost it. Same with Catching Fire.
B000001FSR|3.0|If you love Waits, you'll probably at least like this album. I wasn't sure what to think, and this album convinced me that I really don't like Tom Waits at all.<br /><br />Musically, the performances, arrangements, and production are more varied and more carefully thought out than some of his \\"we just hit stuff while he growled like a drunk\\" albums. But, oddly, those albums work better. Despite the spooky production, the songs are simplistic. The overall album has a theatrical intent, not as music, but to paint a picture; it's not really music you'd listen to for pleasure. Or indeed that I would listen to at all. However, you don't listen to Tom Waits for pleasure, you listen to him to inflict a certain mood on the audience, and in this he succeeds, mostly. If you're looking to capture, in an album, the feeling of \\"mediocre show tunes performed by a drunk at a low-rent theater,\\" order now.<br /><br />But, I'm not sure I can buy into the usual \\"drunk loser cosplay\\" this time. The production seems contrived; I feel like I'm watching the action from box seats with a glass of wine while whispering to friends. I am never involved in the emotion. Coltrane is a better soundtrack-for-having-nothing-left-to-lose. Nick Drake is better \\"actually I'm doing quite well but I want to feel like I could kill myself for half an hour\\" music. And Waits' other albums are generally more believable, partly because they aren't trying so hard.<br /><br />The production does project a certain depressing mood. As annoying as I found it, this self-indulgent slumming is exactly what Tom Waits fans love. However, I hate nearly every song on the album, and much of the album has a faint aura of overproduced pretension tainting the desired \\"loserness\\". It's carefully and artfully crafted, and I think that was a mistake.<br /><br />[edit] After another listen, Sorry, Tom, it's really only a 3 star album.y Waits-fan friends will like. Mostly. If you never hear music you hate, you will never hear music you love!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think that this app is awesome and it is great for kindle fire. The graphics are great and the little leprechaun is to die for... I hope you get this app and love it!

B0054JZC6E|5.0|great experience to the people who wants to play in each game with a challenge to get the next game.
030788743X|5.0|A tremendously fun ride! Perfect read for a day with no electricity! Tons of 80s nostaglia that will bring back a lot of memories and make you struggle to place a few. This highly imaginative tale also has a trio of characters that are rich and will have your rooting for them from the edge of your seat.
B0063GORYU|5.0|A few easy and fun game. I play it all the time on my kindle fire.it save at ant time so you can go back and finsh
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its ok....a lot like poop.........like you...you reading this rite now!!! hahaha...got u...oh and by the way.....u smell like poop too!!!!!!!
0545265355|5.0|Not much more can be said about this Masterpiece of storytelling.  Read all the reviews and opinions.  Buy the books.  Read the books and write your view and opinion.  When all done read the Starters, by Lissa Price.  You won't be disappointed.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Lots of twists & turns - dark courtroom drama/mystery. Good and fast read. Glad to have found Landay - will look into his other two books when I need a distracting mystery that still makes you think a little bit!
0062082353|5.0|This is an easy read and a great book!<br /><br />This is a good book about a very patriotic person.  The stories are real.  The one about the beach ball is so funny!  And the occasional points of view from his wife are great.
B00729GQ0A|5.0|I'm actually feeling a little lost. I've finished The Forever Girl, a book which has been my constant companion for the last three days. I read it at every opportunity. I might just have to read it all over again!<br /><br />The story revolves around Sophia Parsons, a small town girl, whose world changes following a simple night out with her friend, Ivory and a meeting with the gorgeous Charles. Nothing is as it seems, nothing will ever be the same for her again.<br /><br />It moves at a pace and I was caught up within its spell. It has the 'supernatural' lot - witches, shifters, vampires, spirits and romance. It twists and turns from start to finish. I just loved it!<br /><br />The Forever Girl is my introduction to author Rebecca Hamilton. She tells a good story and she does it very well. Like many others who have read the book, I can't wait to read the sequel.
0439023513|5.0|The first two books are great kid books. Good vs. evil. Black and white.<br />This book, on the other hand, is very much about the shades of grey and uncertainty that underscore the human condition. It is very much an adult book where beauty lies in the tragic beauty of existence. This is Leopold Bloom, where the first two are Bilbo Baggins.<br />I really enjoyed the first two.<br />I loved Mockingjay. It was a perfect conclusion.
B0034G4P4O|5.0|Fast paced and fun. Easy to forget they are not real people. Very life like. Lots of action and fun characters. I can't wait for #2.
1451629184|4.0|I couldn't read the whole book.<br />I had to skip some pages, due to it being too much for me.<br /><br />I am glad she wrote the book so that people will know what that bastard did to her and so they can learn from it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is like Mario but its about a lepercon world its the almost best app on my kindle fire
B005HSG3VK|5.0|This product is easy to use and is well worth the price. I read the good and bad reviews and was reluctant to make the purchase. From the first day I received it, I put it it to use.  It was easy to install and works just like it claims.  I have had no problems with the band and no problems with the stand.  I was looking for something sturdy that would protect it in the event of a fall. I do not have any complaints as of now.  I will update this review should anything change.
B004ZWKWQQ|5.0|This was my first large Lego set - never thought I should spend more than a few bucks in one, and they're quite expansive in Brazil. Have to say that I really like Lego's, and spacecrafts too, so this one is kinda touched by the two sides of the Venn diagram.<br />Anyway, putting it up was AWESOME, I felt like a kid for two days straight. The construction is solid and well done, all set looks great (spacecraft, rockets, fuel tank, cart, satellite), separated and altogether. I strongly recommend it, for Lego lovers and space mission addictees.
0316077054|4.0|A most dark and devouring sequel has enveloped within the pages, captivating the reader. As if things weren't hectic enough, now Ethan has to deal with not only learning that he has survived death, but that Lena has now rejected him due to the painful loss if her uncle Macon. Ethan doesn't have a clue of the thoughts and pain, not to mention the guilt running through Lena. All he knows is that his biggest fear is that she's turning dark. I can't say that I didn't get quite fed up with Lena myself, purposely dodging Ethan. I also feared that she was turning dark. I just couldn't get over that she had turned to Ridley and John Breed. These people are not who she should've turned to, and it's when Lena completely disappears that Ridley shows her true colors.<br />  Realizing that Gatlin isn't the quaint little town it seems on the surface, Ethan, along with the help of Lena and Link, set out to find Lena, in hopes to save her soul from the darkness it desires. Getting help from some unexpected places is quite shocking in the least. The ending is sure to unveil sure shocks and many more questions.
B004LP3AYI|1.0|I got Wizard's First Rule on Kindle and it was great. However this book is atrocious it appears to have been formatted by a 1st grader. I am very displeased I hope that amazon fixes it and gives a free update to people who bought this version. I am actually mad about it.
B00002DF4X|3.0|I know this CD was used, but apparently it wasn't listened to before sending it out, as it has a song midway that skips and won't play. It is annoying. I won't buy from them again.

B002WY65W4|3.0|This horror-comedy click is of the people in the land where majority was turned into zombies after a virus epidemic.<br /><br />If this work is without some hidden bottom-line dealt with present, it would hardly comprehend simply contradicting moments in the story of the post-apocalypse USA.

B006LQQ1GE|5.0|I bought this album a few days ago. I haven't listened to anything else since. Interesting combination of different music styles. Yes, it does sound a little 80s, but with a new modern spin.
B00005JM02|5.0|My Grandsons enjoy the video very much. They watch it almost everyday now.It is one of their all time favorites!
0439023521|5.0|Ok I love this book, the violence and the action. But Suzanne Collins You are a copier. You copied off of Battle Royale. So you watched the movie or read the book. Then you took the idea changed it a little bit then CALLED THE IDEA YOU'RE OWN! That's not cool!But I still love your book series!
B000AYEL6U|5.0|Based on the book by Elizabeth Gaskell and set in the 1850s of Victorian England, North and South is a story with some strong similarities to Pride and Prejudice. After losing his faith, Margaret's preacher father moves his wife and daughter form bucolic south England to its industrial north, where he earns his living teaching. Initially the transition is hard on Margaret, but though she doesn't have Elizabeth Bennet's sense of humor, she does have her intelligence and determination, and she begins to make the best of her situation. When she first meets factory owner John Thornton she's shocked by the roughness of his actions and the haughtiness of his demeanor, but that gradually changes as she learns more about him, and about the manners and customs of the north. As in Pride and Prejudice, there's a badly botched marriage proposal and both characters ultimately have a positive effect on each other.<br /><br />North and South has four episodes and each seemed better than the last to me. The first engaged me mildly, but by the last two I was enthralled and the ending is everything a lover of Austen-type fiction would want.
B005HSL626|5.0|This game was the most fun I've had in a long time. I just got my kindle fire and this was the first game I tried. totally a great snatch

0375842209|1.0|This book must appeal to young adults because it is written in same way text messages are delivered with short choppy sentences, bursts of repetitive information and pictures. How sad that books are now being dumbed down in this way! As an adult, I found the book extremely difficult to get through and the story very contrived. I never identified with or cared for any of the characters and thus felt the book was a huge waste of time. Luckily, due it its lack of real story, I was able to skim the last 400 pages in just under an hour and finished it in time for my book club.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|love it love it loved &quot;it love's it good stuff amazing good game so awesome so sweet kids love it like they love cake or candy
B007PTJOV0|1.0|when you get further into the game it starts to nott work.. the controls don't work and iif you kill rhings you can still get hurt not really that fun with the limitations
0439023513|3.0|I won't spoil anything for those of you who haven't read it, yet-- I only hope that when you have the opportunity to read it, you will not feel alone in your mistrust of the author or your frustration in an ending that turns out to be more disappointing than the ending of the last Harry Potter film. We all wanted more, no one is disputing this, but I think I understand why Suzanne wrote this book the way she did.<br /><br />We all knew these books would become movies. We all knew that the movies would twist certain aspects of the books to become more \\"movie-dramatic\\", adapting it better to the visual beauty of film. I think Suzanne knew this, too. And I think it was her prerogative to write the books in a way that gave all the facts and details so that when the movie was made, the director had licence to change things to appeal better to us (while still having all the specifics from the books to make it all fit together). If you look at the last book in this way, it makes a little more sense. But a very strong warning comes with this explanation: If Suzanne ever happens upon this critique in a timely fashion, she should note that we all have high expectations for the movie, Mockingjay. The fans are trusting that they will have a little more satisfaction with the film adaptation of this sad and exciting story, and if this is not taken into account with the screenplay there will be a lot of angry people unwilling to buy whatever collector's edition DVD/Blueray that will fuel her percentage of the profits. Suzanne needs to be smarter than Rowling and give the ending we all want to see, so that we can come back later and say, \\"Wow, there was a lot of suffering, and sure it was realistic, but I'm so relieved I can say the ending was worth it all.\\"<br /><br />Trust me when I say that if you are not a fan of endings that leave you wanting more, perhaps it would be best for you not to read the book before seeing the movie. I understand there are some people who make it a rule of reading the books before the movie, and I agree with you-- but bend your rule just this once.<br /><br />If you cannot resist the curiosity and your hunger needs to be satiated with finding out what happens next, by all means, read it! But don't say you weren't warned...le of reading the books before the movie, and I agree with you-- but bend your rule just this once.<br /><br />If you cannot resist the curiosity and your hunger needs to be satiated with finding out what happens next, by all means, read it! But don't say you weren't warned...

B00729GQ0A|4.0|Book Title: The Forever Girl<br /><br />Author: Rebecca Hamilton<br /><br />Published By: Immortal Ink Publishing<br /><br />Genre: Paranormal Romance<br /><br />Recommended Age:  +16<br /><br />Reviewed By: Emily Tuley / AngelsCryHavoc<br /><br />Blog Reviewed For: Great Minds Think Aloud Literary Community<br /><br />Rating:  4 Ravens<br /><br />I kind of puttered around this book for a while torn between my thoughts to read it and the chance to actually settle down to do so.  Sometimes life just gets a little hectic and we all have to take a moment and relax.  Once I got the chance to I was pleased with the selection I chose to enjoy my time and it didn't make me regret settling down.  It was definitely  a different turn of events but a book I feel that most will enjoy when they get the chance to read it.  The author took something of the normal and make it into an all new section with a chance to see it from her own angle.<br /><br />Typically average wiccan, at least that's what Sophie thinks of herself.  Nothing special nothing dangerous and certainly nothing evil.  She works at a diner struggling to keep her grandfathers house that's been left to her since his death.  With a very Christian woman hell bent on making her life hell as well as getting her hands on Sophia's house.  It's bad enough that she's already got her hands on Sophia's mom and made her practically turn against her own daughter.  Sophia just wants to find a way to shed off her worries and the distress that's around her and rid herself of the whole town and it's past on her and her ancestor's.<br /><br />To top it all off she feels her self cursed as the constant buzzing in her mind has done nothing but grow louder over the last few days.  Her number one thing most of all she just wants to find a way to cure what she's come to call her curse.  This leads her on an adventure and life changing events where she finds that sometimes friends, Enemies and family can surprise you no matter which wayyou turn, some let you down some support you and others have no ones best interest in mind but their own.<br /><br />Pick it up and check it out for yourself.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|I loved the first book, read it in a couple hours, loved it. I was so excited to get this one. Sat down for a good read and it was so slow. I had a real hard time getting into it. It really didn't get interesting til  about half way. Now that didn't stop me from buying the third book, I want to know how it ends. If you buy this book, just keep going it does get better promise.
B0071WQ7WU|5.0|I really liked the band's previous album, \\"The Sound of Madness\\", so much that although I have been anxiously waiting for the newest album I was thinking that I would be disappointed.  Not only was it better than expected but I found it superior to the previous!  I dare say that after listening to it the first time I was instantly hooked!  Every song has a certain \\"musicality\\" to it.  Brent Smith's vocals soar and Zach Meyers guitar work is quite impressive. Musically, as a whole, it is exceptional!  Just when I thought that the previous track was great the next one gets even better. Although I could do without some of the foul lanuage used in 2 of the tracks it certainly is not gratuituous and used only to emphasize a point in the song.  It has become my album of choice and listen to it almost daily.  I can certainly tell why it took so long between when \\"Madness\\" was released and this one as every song is really good to outstanding!  I can honestly tell you that while I enjoyed certain tracks more than others (as you would expect)the collection as a whole is outstanding and I highly recommend it.  My personal favorites are \\"Miracle\\", \\"Enemies\\" and \\"Unity\\" and most of the others are just as good.  Shinedown...you did it again in producing a memorable piece of work!  Just don't wait so long for your next one!
0307959856|4.0|Good story. felt unloyal to Jane Austin. Would rcommend reading if you have read Pride and Predjudice. Light and fun reading.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|good app.. fun games that are challenging and addicting. good app for passing time when there is no wifi is available.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Literally the worst book I have ever read.  Bad writing.  Absolutely no plot.  The author basically wrote a really bad sex scene in which  she refers to the vagina as my sex and down there...and then copied and pasted that scene like 300 times.  And that was the entire book.  Huge waste of money.
B006WR0A8W|5.0|I have been using this x mini Kai Bluetooth speaker for about a month now. I fell in love with this product instantly. Wonderfully built super durable and portable. Connects with my iPhone very easily and it comes with a mic for hands free calling. It's great for music as well. Has great base and sound that sometimes hard to believe that comes from a speaker that connects wirelessly! I thought $ 110 was a bit pricey but it's truly worth it. Now it's a bit cheaper as well. Recommend to anybody who has a phone or any device that has Bluttooth!
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this app was so fun and I get points for this review this is the best app ever. I love it.

0545123291|4.0|I was so frustrated when I finished this book I cannot even begin to put it on a scale. The ending left me so mad!!<br /><br />Firt off, I was really glad to be hearing Isabel's side. I like her for some reason I do. It was nice to introduce a new charactere also..I hope that Isabel and him won't just tolerate each other for much longer either. I want them together for some reason I just do.<br /><br />Then we get Grace and Sam the \\"perfect\\" couple. Everything should be right, Sam is human. Of course, we can't make everything right though. They have to have an obstacle. I HATE THE OBSTACLE!!!!! I don't like the \\"idea\\" that Cole comes up with at the end either. All this frustrated me and I wish we could have just come up with something else. Left it with Grace's parents and Sam taking over Beck's job with the wolfs. Something, anything but this.<br /><br />Well I'm reading book 3 now and I heard I might be just as disappointed. I really hate this too. Shiver ended with everything going right and then nothing is!!! I'm ready to end this series.
0375869026|5.0|It is difficult to write a review for this story, because I can honestly find nothing to criticize; I warn you, then, that most of this review will most likely be me gushing about August.<br /><br />I was very impressed by the writing style.  It was purposefully crafted to sound authentic from each of the voices that were woven into the story.  Auggie, the heart of the story, is the most believable and central to each and every new perspective that is added.<br /><br />[Some spoilers will follow.]  The simple honesty and unquestioning acceptance in his voice made him a character every bit as deserving of his happy ending as any character I have ever read.  I previously read a reviewer's complaint that the entire premise of this book, the ending in particular, is self-congratulatory, for other people to feel good about the fact that while society may suck sometimes, we are ultimately accepting and inherently good--and that August is only special because of his appearance.  I don't have the same experience as everyone else, but I can't agree with this view.<br /><br />To read this book, for me, was to ultimately come to *know* August.  Although he ascribed his own standing ovation in the end as because he was different, because no one else understood what it was to be him--I didn't believe this for a second.  Reading all the additional perspectives in the book allowed me to understand firsthand just how the characters around him grew because of him.  His sister, Jack, Summer, Amos--these characters ultimately become stronger because of knowing Auggie, and making the choice to be his friend.  Being kind isn't just the throwaway phrase we sometimes use it for, or synonymous with the bland 'nice'--'Oh, you're nice, but...'--rather, it's an active choice.<br /><br />\\"Kinder than is necessary. Because it's not enough to be kind. One should be kinder than needed.\\"  August isn't just kind himself; he inspires kindness.  Although he is brutally mocked by kids his age, and even by some so-called adults, he doesn't stop going to school every day.  He perseveres for those that are brave enough to show him even the smallest bit of kindness, and returns it tenfold.  He isn't perfect.  He throws tantrums and acts younger than his age.  But he is without question the strongest character in this book.  Anyone who can say, \\"Like, it's okay.  I know I'm weird-looking, take a look, I don't bite,\\" is, in my mind, capable of quite a great bit of kindness.  He always assumes the best of people, and the most heartbreaking part of the book is when that faith in someone he thought was his friend was shattered--because it is this faith that keeps him going, that keeps him from being bitter about the cards he has been dealt.<br /><br />I warned you that I would start ranting about this book, given the chance.  But really, it says something that I'm not ranting about the book itself, but about August.  Because when a character transcends the pages like he does--and becomes a person that you're so invested in--then you know there's something magical about the story.  I chose this book hesitantly, but I am so very glad I did.<br /><br />Reading the book, you'll want to be a part of the Summer table, too.n by some so-called adults, he doesn't stop going to school every day.

B007J4T2G8|5.0|The title of this review pretty much describes the book perfectly.. You'll either love it or hate it. While you can tell from the number of high reviews vs low reviews it's quite obvious, seeing as there are very few 'in-between' reviews.  This is the first book I've read that involves BDSM & it kind of shocked me at first to be honest with you, but by the 3rd book it became a normalcy of the storyline.<br /><br />Christian Grey is a character that you love to hate, a late 20-something CEO of a company with unlimited resources to control lives & ruin them.. Much like Courtney from Ben's season of The Bachelor, it's like a train wreck that you cannot stop watching, or in this case, reading.  Reading further into the book you learn why Grey is the way that he is & why he acts accordingly.  It is extremely interesting to read the story line that James came up with to explain the maddness of Grey & how he recognizes & perhaps overcomes his inner demons.  Anastasia Steele is a 20-something soon-to-be college graduate when she meets Grey & the story begins to unfold.  This is the character that both loves & hates Grey & that is radiated right off of the pages in the book.  The book is told from her point-of-view & she struggles with inner demons of a different type when deciding what type of relationship, if any, that she wants with Christian Grey.  As the book(s) go on you cannot put them down, or I couldn't, because I HAD to find out what was going to happen next.<br /><br />All-in-all, this is a quick, easy read. I read the entire series in about 4 days, the only thing I tired of are the very adolescent sayings of Anastasia Steele, & the repetitiveness of theses sayings & words. (i.e. Double Crap).  I'm a very fast reader & it wasn't hard to eventually skim over the lines of repitition. Oh, & yes, there is a lot of sex, when I say a lot it's an understatement. Although, what do you expect about a book that revolves around a story of BDSM?<br /><br />Pick it up & read it or lay it back down.. The entire trilogy isn't on the top of the New York Times Best Seller's list because people hate it.. (:
B000WZAE1I|5.0|This is a great movie.  I don't think many people went to the box office to see it, but it was great.  I was very happy to find it available on Amazon.com.  Thanks!
B005VTS4EY|5.0|great game that makes you use your noggin. makes you anxious while playing but it is constantly fun. a little frustrating at times but that just makes you think harder. absolutely love this game.
0670023329|5.0|Anyone who values their freedom should please read Blaine Harden's book, \\"Escape From Camp 14.\\" After reading this book, every time I eat, I think of how the North Korean people are literally starving to death. For what? So that a power-hungry money-grabbing dictator, who brutally crushes the souls of his people can supply his military with arms. I am very thankful to have enough food, but even more thankful that Shin got out and can eat with freedom. Harden also shares that North Korea's military is hungry as well, with reports of stealing food from civilian farms. With unheard of forced self-fertilizer, some North Korean's living in the city go from house to house collecting human feces to grow crops. It is sickening that the Kim family has their own bowling alley, while their people's souls and stomachs are starved. Never again? History is again repeating itself with this holocaust. What did Shin ever do to North Korea's dear leader? Because North Korea does not have freedom of speech, if their people do not think correctly, they are tortured, starved, shot, and treated worse than animals.<br />In North Korea, the \\"eating problem\\" has not only devastated its people, it has eaten the brain of their dear leaders.

B006YZOXHQ|5.0|BARBARELLA: The product specs above, quotes the screen ratio of the Blue-ray version that is about to be released as 1.85:1. I hope this is incorrect as this masterpiece of campy science fantasy was shot at 2.35:1 and the version I have on DVD is from a poor quality (scratched and dirt marked) projection print. Any body know any different? Please speak up.<br />Brian

B005SFR7YE|5.0|This show is great.  We have been to see it in Portland, Oregon twice but watching it with thousands of new friends at Albert Hall was a real treat!
B003FHGI9W|1.0|A true story (although the real one took place in Japan, not Connecticut), so many people recommended this to me, that I had high hopes.<br /><br />But how much cute play time between a man and dog can a moviegoer endure? The rest of the move - dialog between husband and wife, the clumsy son-in-law, the fact that absolutely EVERYONE in town knows EVERYONE.<br /><br />The handsome Gere and three beautiful dogs (puppy, main star and elder animal) can't rescue this movie from the bottom of the heap.<br /><br />Hachi might have waited nine years for his owner to return. But you'll not want to be returning to this rendition very often.
B005QJZ5FA|5.0|My 17 year old son died in a car accident on 2/16/12.  I heard of this cd on NPR a couple of days before the accident. Listening to the tracks hit home so hard and so close to home on how I've felt, that I can't explain it.  tracks 1, 3, 4, 7, really are what im writing about.
B0078N2MTE|3.0|I'm disappointed in this movie. The trailer really draws you in and I thought the story would be really interesting. It was, it was an excellent story & I was completely engulfed in it in the beginning. I actually found myself relating to the psychological dysfunction of the main character. Scary! However, I kept waiting for this \\"amazing ending\\" that was teased. The ending, sadly, left my fiance and I wanting much much more. I was left with this feeling that the idea in the story never fully developed. My exact thought was \\"no this can't be the ending, right?! Nooo!!\\". I wanted to see something else happen that never did. That's all. This movie could've been phenomenal!

The variety of insights helped create exercises, examples and material that is incredibly insightful in helping you to understand yourself at a deeper level.  Thanks to this book I made some pretty significant decisions on the direction of my career and feel so much better about my newfound direction.
B003L20ICE|4.0|The movie was delivered right on time. When I played the disk it played fine but did skip once. Amazon did a great job for the price and the movie was all right.
B0031ESIZQ|5.0|The product contains RCT3 with all the expansions for it; Soaked! and Wild!<br />There's a heap of game play and tools to create your own park as well as playing through the main campaigns in the game.<br />The game worked on my computer with Windows 7 with no problems.<br /><br />In my opinion this is a great game that is suitable for all ages.
B0054JZC6E|3.0|This collection of games, while quite large, does not offer a single game that stands out in terms of quality. Unlocking new games is a good idea, but not knowing whether or not the game you are unlocking is good or not does drag it down. The controls for many of the games tend to be hit or miss. They either work well or not at all. Kind of hard to complain since it is free, but even that price, it's hard to get excited.

B006RUJST6|5.0|\\"That's unreal.\\"<br /><br />\\"Yeah, it is. But it's my real.\\"<br /><br />Slammed is one of the BEST books I've ever read. So far, it's the best book I've read in 2012, and I seriously doubt that it will be knocked out of the top spot anytime soon.<br /><br />I started Slammed last night right before my bedtime, and I ended up staying awake until two o'clock in the morning to finish it. You couldn't pry this book from my fingers. I'm not kidding when I tell you that I seriously considered re-reading this novel immediately after I finished, and if it weren't for the sequel, Point of Retreat, then I probably would have. It's that good!<br /><br />I'm not going to write a summary for this book or tell you what it's about because it's definitely a book that you have to read and discover for yourself, but I will tell you that Slammed is the perfect example of PERFECTION.  Slammed is an all-consuming, emotional story that will take over your life. It's a realistic coming-of-age story about death, life, and love. This story is an emotional rollercoaster: it's heartbreaking, hilarious, sweet, scary, lovely, depressing, and hopeful. It's everything you'd ever hope for in a story.  It's the type of book that will have you balling your eyes out, smiling like a Cheshire cat, and laughing like a hyena- all at the same. It's the kind of story that touches your heart and leaves you breathless.<br /><br />I will tell you that I was a little apprehensive about the whole slam poetry thing. I had no clue what slam poetry was, and I expected it to either be weird, boring, or pretty cool. It was none of those things. It was one of the most bad a$$ things that I've ever read. We learned a lot about the characters through their slams, and every poem either moved me to tears or cracked me up.<br /><br />The characters in Slammed are unique, thoughtfully created, and beautifully written. They are three-dimensional characters who are entertaining and full of life. They are easy to love ;), andthey make a lasting impression.<br /><br />Readers will fall in love with Will because of his passion for poetry, his love for his younger brother, and his need to do the right, responsible thing. Readers will fall in love with Lake for her strength, her setbacks, her humor, her maturity, and her honesty. Readers will fall in love with Lake's younger brother Kel for his innocence, his inappropriate questions, and his backwards days. Readers will fall in love with Lake's best friend Eddie because she's an in-your-face, optimistic person who doesn't close off her heart even though she's been hurt numerous times. Readers will fall in love with Lake's mom for her amazing advice and her unconditional love. And, readers will fall in love with Lake's father for the man he was and his ability to take away Lake's worries with a magic clip.<br /><br />Honestly, I don't really understand the advantages and disadvantages of being a self-published v. published author; I just know that the majority of my recent favorite novels are by self-published authors. I love discovering Indie authors. I really wish that I had the funds, credentials, and the notoriety to get my favorite authors published, but unfortunately, I don't. However, hypothetically speaking, if I could choose one book to back from 2012, it'd be this one. I know it's not my book, but I fiercely believe in this book.<br /><br />If you're familiar with my reviews then you know that I don't hand out 5 STAR ratings often. I only give 5 STAR ratings to the best of the best. Slammed by Colleen Hoover is the best of the best, and it definitely deserves a 5 STAR rating. I never questioned, not even for a second, whether or not this novel was worthy of 5 STARS. This novel was FLAWLESS from beginning to end. I wouldn't change a single thing about it.<br /><br />In my opinion, Slammed is perfect for EVERYONE. I honestly can't fathom anyone not loving this story. I really encourage everyone to follow my 5 STAR advice: BUY THIS NOVEL NOW!<br /><br />-XOXO<br /><br />READING, EATING & DREAMING<br /><br />FOR MORE REVIEWS CHECK OUT MY BLOG ON BLOGSPOT: READING, EATING & DREAMING I WAS BLAIR WALDORF.

B000IKNZMM|4.0|I enjoyed this film because of the beautiful photography and the actor(s). I am a big fan of George C Scott. One can agree/disagree with the premise of the film but I though it was well cast and well acted.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|Its almost as good as Mario games so its pretty cool to mee. so people you should try this game and its good to waste time too. This game is also amussing if your bored or have nothing to do and it has some what of a good graphics. I think people will like this game if they gave it a chance and played it....damn had to write all this just to make a rate never again
B005HS00NW|4.0|The opening lines of the first track \\"Intro\\" do a marvelous job of framing the album that follows: \\"We didn't need a story. We didn't need a real world. We just had to keep walking. And we became the stories, we became the places.\\"<br /><br />HURRY UP, WE'RE DREAMING creates a symphonic landscape not just reminiscent of the 80s with all it's hyperactivity and pathos, but a complete re-imagining of that era sans its plastic, artificial, faux glamor. Everything was big in the eighties, the hair, the cars, and especially the emerging synth-pop beats from the likes of NEW ORDER, PET SHOP BOYS, and DURAN DURAN. At their best, the originators of electro-drum machines layered over keyboards and synthesizers created a musical landscape with a depth greater than the sum of their largely synthetic parts. At their worst, they managed to create music devoid of real emotional resonance, robotic sounds played by robotic musicians.<br /><br />M83 succeeds in creating a sound that deeply connects to their forebears without being swallowed by them. They take the best of what made synth-pop immensely likable and couple it with a modern sensibility. They do become the places, even the memories of the frantic eighties repainted on a new canvas. Tracks like \\"Reunion\\" practically pull the listener out of their post 9-11 modern world and immerse them in that shimmering decade. Energetic, at times even silly (Raconte - Moi Une Histoire), HURRY UP, WE'RE DREAMING is never boring.<br /><br />I disagree with the reviewers who labeled this album derivative or too mainstream. There is a significant difference between co-opting someone's work and integrating a sound into a stylistic approach that adds as much as it borrows. I'm not entirely sure what 'too mainstream' means anymore. Everything is mainstream. Even Indy has become mainstream. The bottom line should be: is the music listenable? Does it have something to say? I feel that HURRY UP, WE'RE DREAMING answers on both fronts.<br /><br />Ultimately building a successful album, not just a collection of singles, is about creating ATMOSPHERE. And M83 have done a fine job here. It's impossible (as someone who lived through the glorious and awful eighties) to listen to this album without being taken somewhere. Maybe not the real world, maybe not the eighties that was, but to a place where flowing beat and synthetic sounds chart a pathway into a musical homage to the best of what the eighties had to offer. They do become the stories, and what's even better, they take you with them.<br /><br />4/5 Starsimately building a successful album, not just a collection of singles, is about creating ATMOSPHERE.

I have found a book, a novel called Free to Be Me by Arthur Vonshtain and gooosh, what would I do-no limits- to see that film. I would even pay 10 times the ticket price. Bollywood hear me make the move, make it now!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|good game just like Mario seems a bit easier. I recommend it for any1 that likes video games. Even better its free hehe
B004EPYZV2|1.0|I wouldn't advertise it ever as a good time film. There are nice movies right now. Take Limitless, Island, Hangover, and so on. It is an old movie, quality are not as good either. Technology can't go back but it can create greatness!
B005MYEQ4U|4.0|This was quite a different movie. At first I didn't think I would like it, but I did. I would recommed it to anyone who asked.
B002IFT1ZA|5.0|I just finished watching this first season of Game of Thrones. I was hesitant at first, but thought \\"What the hell. I have nothing else to do.\\"<br /><br />I am SO glad that I didn't have anything else to do!! :)<br /><br />I absolutely HATED some of the actor's parts in this series. I sat on my sofa wishing that they would become the next one to have their heads lopped off.<br /><br />I limited myself to one disk each night and was actually dreading the night I put in the last disk because I didn't want it to end.<br /><br />The last episode was so absolutely great, I was clapping my hands and saying \\"Hell yea!!\\"<br /><br />If you like this sort of entertainment (knights, head lopping, twists and turns, etc.), watch this series. If you do not enjoy it, there is something seriously wrong with you. :)
B004A8ZWVK|5.0|I had already seen this movie at the theater. I wanted to have it for watching it again. I have to say it is one of my favorites in a very long time. It is a must see for all ages.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is absolutely so much fun! its like Mario world but with a leprochaun!!!!!!! You should definitely get this game!
B001TXUPH0|5.0|As part of my Prime membership I started watching this at home and could not stop until I finished the series in one week.  I went to work in between episodes :)  Totally addictive!
B007PTJOV0|4.0|The game has good graphics and is fun to play. The game does require the use of two hands at the same time so is difficult for kids 6 and under who are still developing their manual dexterity. Also note that the game does have an open feint mention at the beginning but it never appears after the game launches so is not a problem.
1612130283|3.0|This book is most definitely not a literary classic (There are many flaws including the continued use of British English phrases by the American protagonist)  BUT it was entertaining for the beach. I was apprehensive that this series condoned violence by reading some of the articles out there but if you read the whole series it does not.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Kindle Fire: Only issue is tapping objects, and the settler interacts with the wrong object.  Small complaint, but can be frustrating manipulating small objects.  Enough fun to wish the settler wouldn't run out of energy.
B005EWDA3I|5.0|As always, Murakami knows how to tell stories but this time he shows that he can tell stories in several genres, equally good and at the same time: reading takes you to the worlds of fantasy, thriller, love story, fiction, essays, etc. 1Q84 spans many areas of life and society and Murakami does so with subtlety and understatements. There is no indignation. The story is told by someone who knows how to keep a distance. It could be said that 1Q84 sometimes is a bit repetitive and this makes the novel long and in some places very long. This being said, read it and because of the many, many pages, I would recommend reading it via Kindle. [[ASIN:0307593312 1Q84]]

B001MEJY8W|3.0|I did not love this film.  I did not hate this film.  I waited 36 hours to post a review and I still don't know how I feel.<br /><br />Obviously, you know the plot by now.  And you've probably read all about the plot twists.  You probably know the whole dang movie by now, so I will not summarize it.<br /><br />Did I have a problem with the violence?  Not until the last third of the film.  Those parts were extraordinarily troubling to me.<br /><br />Did I have a problem with the plot?  No, it made sense.  But I did have a problem with the \\"premise\\" - although the way things were told was great, the plausibility wasn't there.<br /><br />I enjoyed the last five minutes very much because it tied everything together.<br /><br />This movie is not bad.  This movie was not enjoyable.  This movie troubled me.  But this movie was well done.

B007J4T2G8|1.0|All three books are on the NY Times Bestseller's list this week leaving me terrified and disappointed in readers.  I read the first book and rolled my eyes as frequently as Miss Steele did because I was overwhelmed with horror.  No plot, no great twists, no separation of characters (they all say 'Laters' when they leave a room or end an e-mail), and most of all, this author has no idea how to write about sex.  Her play by play sex scenes are beyond shallow.  If she knew how to write, she would have zoomed in on Anastasia's mental reaction to being dominated, as well as her shocked psyche at being so turned on to being dominated.  But wait a minute....she's a virgin.  The protaganist is not even believable.  Any normal girl would run for the hills with no sexual experience. Oh my, let's not forget that she has no interest in her new persuer's over-the-top wealth.  Anastasia, doesn't run, she engages and is multi-orgasmic from the get-go.  This is a joke.  Penthouse Forum is a better read. I think this trilogy should be renamed 'Fifty Lashes Will Get You Published.'

B00422LESO|4.0|This was a light and enjoyable read. I would rate it higher, but it didn't have the read it over and over & find new depths of meaning qualities of a great book. But, that is not always what I am looking for. This is perfect if you are looking for something fun and not too intense. It doesn't demand too much from the reader, but it certainly delivers entertaining exchanges of banter and wit, love and confusion, all with humor.

B006RUJST6|5.0|With exception of Easter day... I would have read this book in one day... I could NOT put it down... not really fond of YA books... but this one had everything I needed in it... Strange, but I found myself wanting to email all these quotes to a bunch of my friends and family... the book is loaded with GREAT things to say to one another!!!  Such great relationships between Mother/Daughter, Sister/Brother, Friends, Boys!!!  It made me feel like I was 18 again... ahhhh... Got this book on loan from a fellow Kindle/Maryes/Facebook friend... She was right... I ABSOLUTELY LOVED IT...  I can't really say much more... except... READ IT!!!  You won't be sorry... can't waste much more time... gotta get reading the next one... &#34;Point of Retreat&#34;  See y'all!!!
0439023513|5.0|Really I don't understand why so many people didn't like the book, personally I found it wildly entertaining, and the direction it takes in the end I did not see it coming.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it got a old game boy feel to it it takes you back the game play is good its very much like Mario but that's what I love about it you cant beat an old classic and this games got that feel

1594744769|5.0|I adored this book. It's been a while since I read it but the story, combined with the wonderful vintage photos that bring everything to life, has really stayed with me for a long while. Sadness, love, magic, horror - it has it all. Highly recommended for other peculiar readers like me!!
B007JM4CWY|5.0|I originally downloaded this app on my Samsung Galaxy Sii. I waited for it to finally be added to the app store on Kindle and bought it. I'm so glad I did. It is easy and challenging at the same time. It is a bit touchy but nothing I can't live with.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Awesome game! By FAR the best free app on the Kindle Fire! Let's make it the 1# free app! Angry Birds watch out! :D

B007N5YIUS|5.0|This is the best Angry Birds yet! I LOVE IT!<br />I love that there is a new ice bird that turns the cement into ice. If you are lucky enough, it might even turn the pig into ice!<br /> A MUST HAVE APP!!
B0063IH60K|3.0|there should be more options as far as flipping one cards and three cards at. a time<br />plus should have more the one solitaire game.

1400069289|5.0|While I still couldn't quite understand how the bus boycott at Montgomery related to habits, I finished reading this book without a coffee.<br /><br />Whenever I had an urge to read a book (cue), I usually buy a coffee at a local coffee house (routine) and got really happy after reading for an hour (reward).<br /><br />I know drinking too much coffee is probably bad, but I kept this habit even at 23:00 (the coffee house opens 24 hours). The caffeine rush before sleep affects my quality of sleep so I want to change it.<br /><br />Now I am at the coffee shop but I intentionally grab something different, e.g. a bottle of Perrier (a new routine), and still feel happy after reading. Nothing deprived.<br /><br />It sounds so easy that I should have figured out earlier, but well... this is life and you always think it would be difficult to change a habit. It is good that I learned a trick from this book.<br /><br />Thanks!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is insanely fun.! its hard not to like it.! only problem people on the fire should have is the character is a very slow walker.! it didn't effect my exsperience. ! &amp;&amp; don't give the app a 5 star if it is &quot;ok&quot;.!

B0063IH60K|4.0|Good card action and good variety of games. The tutorials could be a little clearer. And there are definitely too many commercials for Starbucks!!!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|yeah you run out of energy quick and you have to wait for it to refill but i like that it makes me put my kindle down, enjoy real life, and have something fun to look forward to later. you even get a cute little notification when your energy is full.  i recommend this game for anyone that needs extra help quitting games on their own :) Enjoy
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I think this game is awesome and this game can keep u intertaned like every day i would play it everyday but sometimes when im on level 5 i get frusterated because it is hard not to make u not play it it is so so so so so so much fun and it makes u lagh.

B007PT3QOQ|5.0|freakin amazing...nuff said. the gameplay is fun ajd simple and straight foward. there is nothing wrong with it and the graphic are extremly good.
B005LAIGSM|4.0|I went and saw this movie with my beautiful fiancee and I enjoyed it...even more than she did. She praises The Notebook and Titanic. Those were good too. I liked The Vow a smidge more than Notebook. But hey, I don't mind going against type because most would disagree. I liked the story of true love severely tested here in a way that you don't see often. How hard would it be if the love of your life forgot who you are and you could lose that person? I felt the pain of that. This isn't a genre that I have tons of favorites in. Like Horror and comedy, romantic movies have to be really special for me to like. Was this perfect? Maybe not. But I didn't think The Notebook was either, but it did the job. Also, I'm not one that is afraid to admit liking a movie like this amid all the gratuitous sex, graphic violence and raunch trash that gets churned out nowadays. Many have lost respect and chasteness, and it reflects.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|A great freemium game for the Kindle Fire. It's nostalgic and cute. I anticipate hours of playtime. A must for any casual gamer.
B0054JZC6E|4.0|If you are looking for an app to waste some time, this is it.  Its fun, entertaining and time consuming!
B004SYP5WC|5.0|This app is very useful it does what it says it is suppose to. It reminds me when the programmed bills are due with plenty of notice to avoid the late charges!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|nice game c; its nice but some games should be like a little easier and cost way less. then itll be awsome. they should also have more jigsaws :D
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is an amazing game for a kindle devise ive always bated Mario but this is really good and amazing

B001I10ABE|5.0|Continued great masterpiece produced by one of the finest metal bands in the world. The Black Album is inarguably one of Metallica's best and my personal favorite behind Master of Puppets. However, many parts of the songs sounded with great contributions made by Jason Newsted. However, he only received songwriting credit to one song: My friend of misery. It really marks Jason's debut in Metallica because of the hazing and contempt folks have shown in And Justice for All which resulted in an almost zero bass album, or in other words, no bass album.
B0052U59F4|1.0|This book was such a let down!  I had heard that it was \\"great\\" and \\"erotic\\" and \\"made you want it to never end\\".  Now I question those reviews and the reviewers too!  This was a simple book, young girl finds rich man.  Period.  End of story.  The \\"erotic\\" parts were OK, but weird - only made me feel sorry for this young girl.  Not worth the time, I found myself \\"speed reading\\" just to get thru it.  I kept hoping that something interesting would happen, but was let down chapter after chapter.  Not worth the time, I am not even reading the second book (which unfortunately I already purchased).
B0033AGPF8|5.0|Axis bold as love marked the continued success of The Jimi Hendrix Experience during the late 1960s, which influenced countless rock and roll and metal bands that followed at their awake. Axis bold as love sounds very similar to their debut, however, with more musical complexity and tastier guitar solos.
0307956350|5.0|A truly fiercely intelligent thriller!  - I could not put it down...very cleverly written, with unexpected twists and turns.....this deserves to soar  to the top of all best-seller lists, and one can only hope that the author Chris Pavone has many more books in him.  What a thrill to have a new author write such a terrific  book!
B0067QPVD2|5.0|The thing really reminds me of the game dead space, which shares the similar characteristic of having alien virus spread across a region that resulted in possessed demons killing whatever they encounter. The movie has a relatively exhilarating action and story that plunges me into thinking about who would be the next infected being. Definitely check this out!
B005LL4U54|5.0|I adore this film and an important part of its appeal is this consistently fantastic score by Ludovic Bource as he's written wonderfully distinctive, evocative pieces for all the major sequences and characters. The first half-dozen numbers are among my favorites as they beautifully establish person, place, & time. However, to be honest, the crowning glory (IMHO) is the inclusion of a piece by Ginastera (Track 8 - \\"Estancia OP.8\\"), which is the selection that's played during the memorable sequence in which Peppy sneaks in to George's dressing room. There's a lot of music packed on to this recording (over an hour's worth of tunes), so you definitely get your money's worth although, curiously, it appears that not everything made it (the Bernard Herrmann \\"Vertigo\\" piece is among the few ommissions). Still, if you're like me and you simply can't get enough of this sublime film, grab a copy of this wonderful, Oscar-winning soundtrack as soon as you can.
0061743526|5.0|The only thing special that I can tell about the 50th anniversary issue is the name, there aren't any extras. Great book but don't bother about the 50th anniversary issue.
0679731377|3.0|This book is well-written, and I was fully engaged with several of the chapters. The first chapter, the best for me, led me to think I would be reading more of the same irreverence about other parts of history. Unfortunately, the approach to subsequent chapters was different, and not as satisfying to me. I could see some of the links between stories, but it wasn't enough for me to get where the author was going. The last several chapters were a slog, and I almost stopped reading.<br /><br />Based on another reviewer, I suspect I would get more out of the book on a second reading. I just can't imagine reading it again. Perhaps I'll look at it again in a few years...
0393080269|5.0|I read an advance copy of this book and it's a great read for both experienced investors and the layman looking to understand the changing global economic landscape.
0307593312|1.0|I love Murakami's books, but this was painfully tedious and repetitive.  If it had come in at 200-300 pages and the plot actually moved forward every page or two, it would be a powerful, unique and amazing novel.  By page 500 all sense of that is long gone, and it is simply the main characters basically sitting around for page after page asking themselves questions.  I felt like Murakami was actually the one asking those questions, and he should have figured out the answers before starting or once in the editing process.<br /><br />There was no editing at all done to this book.  It is repetitive, and repetitive and then some more repetitions.  I knew pretty much how the book was going to end by the halfway point, and it was just a matter of Murakami slowing winding his tedious way to that long-telegraphed ending.<br /><br />Also, the 2 main characters are insanely boring.  I've never met a more boring assassin.  I recommend Murakami books  to friends all the time, but with 1Q84 I will warn them to stay far, far away.
B004LWZWBU|3.0|This movie was OK, but why is it priced above average??? I didn't find anything special about it. It falls in line with any Steve Martin movie, and also with movies like Grumpy (and Grumpier) old men.
B007N5YIUS|1.0|So stupid that they make a free version but make it not work on kindle so lame. This is total bull! Agreed not cool amazon!
086571701X|5.0|I ordered this book when tossing around the idea of starting an aquaponic system.  This book is loaded with lots of helpful information.  It is well written and also and easy read.
B0055SWM08|5.0|great game and completely addicting. cant put my kindle down. quell is another definition of puzzles. super super super fun.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Cute Mario Brothers adaptation. It is smooth on my kindle fire. My kids will love this one! Engaging so far!
B0052U59F4|5.0|Usually dont have a lot of time for reading but was able to knock out all three books during a long weekend!  No matter what you have heard, it is a great love story and you learn what causes certain things to happen.  It is all explained and that is what i love about a book!  really enjoyed all three books, and cant wait for the movie...but who will play Christian Grey???
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Really fun platform game. A complete rip off of Mario bros but still really fun :) Worth the download, promise.
B004GHYCKW|5.0|I saw several media reviews when this came out, and tucked it away in my \\"someday\\" file, for purchase when I could get supersaver shipping...<br />And then I qualified, but sent it with the textbook to my daughter away at college.  After three months, the cd came into my hands and ears, and I commend it to you.  Catchy tunes, good hooks.  Dark lyrics.
B006CTZ2G0|1.0|I've owned and used AKG K240s (and the discontinued K240DF) for more than a decade.  The quality of the product has fallen CONSIDERABLY since manufacturing moved to China.  To be truthful, this was never a particularly durable headset, but the old models made in Europe were head and shoulders above what AKG is shipping now.  They feel flimsy coming out of the box, and the product I received has a poor solder connection internally that makes the right channel audio cut out when you turn your head.  The plastic ear cup is already partially cracked and I've used them for just two months in studio.  The ear padding isn't as soft or comfortable as the old model, either.<br /><br />Sonically, they are everything I'd like my headphones to be, but that doesn't matter when I can only hear in one ear. I won't be buying AKG headphones again in the near future.
B005K17RU0|5.0|easy to use and provides accurate weather updates all day with no annoyances. i keep the app running all the time to stay informed of weather conditions as they tapidly change.
B007PYF7D4|5.0|I am obsessed with this show! I watched seasons 1 and 2 on netflix and shuttered at the thought of having to wait for 3 to hit Netflix.<br /><br />Price is a little high (I wish they had a better full series price, but I guess that's everything in life.)<br /><br />Thanks Amazon!!!
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is great!  It brings the Bible into the 21st century and helps even an ADHD person like me keep up on my devotions.  I love the reminders it sends and the many choices of both devotion studies and Bible versions.  Thank you, youversion creators!

B003HARV98|5.0|Marina is a gem. This is my favorite album since Kate Bush's 1982 album \\"The Dreaming\\". I've been waiting for nearly 30 years to hear another album that's just half as good as \\"The Dreaming\\", and Marina has succeeded on her first attempt. Bravo!
031261246X|5.0|I already have a lot of respect for Mark Russinovich for producing the amazing sysinternals suite which really can help solve the un-solvable when it comes to computer problems. He is 'the man' when it comes to knowing how a computer works inside out, so it's just great that Mark did not turn to the dark-side when it comes to computers. When it comes to this book, I think Mark does great job for the reader who may be a non-IT person a good breakdown of what is going on, and also the level of detail the book goes into makes this all to easy to become reality in your head. So as my title says, if you use a computer...even if its just for facebook, ebay, or anything internet related then you really should read this book, might just make you appreciate your computer a bit more.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is totally the game you're gonna want to play.  you'll<br />love it!!!!!!  if you don't play this, then your missing out<br />a lot of fun.  and I mean it!!!
B006C3Q6GG|4.0|O'Brian has material for a dozen great books and sadly chooses to write twenty. This series is generally rollicking good stuff but oh lord the repetition. YES I KNOW YOU'RE WOKEN BY HOLYSTONES. YES I KNOW HOW TIGHT THE CREW BECOME WHEN YOU'VE TRAINED THEM THE WAY YOU HAVE CAPTAIN AUBREY. Rescue another drowner Capn. Find a new addiction Doctor, and how about a wife? Well what about a new one? Maybe she'll get angry about another woman and leave you. Again. And so will the captain's wife. Again. And perhaps a fortune, won, lost, won, lost, won, lost. I THINK YOU MIGHT HAVE POWERFUL ENEMIES CAPTAIN AUBREY SIR.<br /><br />I think I would say reading past Waterloo is a mistake. Given the series itself doesn't have an ending, Mr O'Brian having sadly died, you have to create your own and you might as well choose one when the repeating plot elements haven't yet begun to trumpet their every appearance.<br /><br />The series also has a bit of a problem in that... nothing seems to matter very much. Jack's great enemies & legal struggles are built up... and then pass away into the night. He goes through nemeses like handkerchieves, and while many prisons hold him, it's just a bit of a cuddle.<br /><br />Still, I read these for some prime naval-gazing and the various ship actions are all very fine, and had I not read all twenty of them in one long sequence I would have been less bothered by the repetition. Four of these fine stars.
B005LAIH2W|5.0|The cheap craptastic design of this DVD & Blu-Ray shows nothing but contempt from Disney Marketing. I mean REALLY, they haven't fired the miserable SOB's yet who screwed up public perception of this movie and denied Disney profits as a result?  I mean REALLY, they can't even come up with a decent font style?  I mean REALLY, how many time does Disney want to be perceived as totally incompetent?  If I were director Andrew Stanton I'd be LIVID.  Surely something in his contract lets him sue their mouse nuts off.<br /><br />Also why did this pre-order suddenly jump $10?  Guess that takes it off MY order.
0439023521|3.0|we have listened to 3/4 of this book and while it is good it's not great in my mind.. I don't like kids hunting kids, I'm not finding any good moral in it, and I dislike there being so many characters with so many strange names to keep track of.<br />I would like to see young adult books to be a good influence on young adults, but I am not getting that with this book.<br />I realize I am in the minority with this opinion but thought I'd give it anyway!
B007PT3QOQ|3.0|it made all my patotos and buildings be done in 222 hours!!!! not even kidding.... other than that glitches its good. but it annoying.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|I really like this app. I like that it has different versions. And I really like that it has audio versions so I can listen to the Word while doing hands on chores like dishes or laundry. Wonderful!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|thought it would be a lil Waco but ended up being really cool not much of a challenge but you'd be surprised though at how time flies while playing.......yeah it's cool 5 stars for updates.. ;.)
B0075564A8|5.0|What's to say about Truth Or Dare that hasn't been written already? When the documentary came out in the spring of 1991, Madonna was the most controversial artist the mainstream had seen since the glory days of Elvis. I think it's easy to forget in 2012 that back in the late 80s/early 90s, Madonna's choice of subject matter was quite taboo. The sexual nature of her early work frightened a lot of people, but it also made her undeniably interesting. Sexually charged themes aside, the film works because it's a sneak peek into the life of a woman in charge. In charge of her show. In charge of her ever-shifting image. And most importantly, in charge of her career.<br /><br />I first saw Truth Or Dare in my early teens and fell in love with it. This wasn't merely because of Madonna, either. The supporting \\"cast\\" is top notch. Nikki and Donna are super endearing as M's faithful backup singers. The personalities of the dancers shine through as well, with the exception Gabriel and Kevin. Even Madonna's run-ins with her family are classic and humorous. \\"Oh God, I was so afraid to do Like A Virgin!\\" she exclaims at one point, just before her dad visits her backstage. She's vulnerable here. There's Madonna without makeup, blowing her nose, admitting that she isn't the best singer, working through her relationship with Warren Beatty, and sometimes even forgetting the cameras are watching.<br /><br />My favorite part of Truth Or Dare is the concert editing. The movie opens with a full blast performance of \\"Express Yourself.\\" Oliver's reunion with his estranged father is painted by a backdrop of \\"Oh Father.\\" Madonna defending her controversial show against the Vatican is accompanied by \\"Live To Tell.\\" The refreshing arrival in Europe is paired with a full-color \\"Holiday.\\" And, of course, the end of the film reminds you to remember your roots with \\"Keep It Together.\\"<br /><br />I also think that Blond Ambition is, to date, Madonna's best tour. Confessions is a close second, but here is Madonna at her popularity peak. Anyway, I'm rambling now. If you haven't seen it, watch Truth Or Dare to be reminded or educated on why Madonna is the world's best-selling female artist. What she stands for. Who she is.<br /><br />Favorite Madonna line (in response to Bobby Brown's 1990 arrest for his onstage antics): \\"I hope he's in jail when I get there.\\"

B007MU85D0|5.0|Iceland never fails to amaze me with the talent that comes from there.  They have given me the likes of Sigur R&oacute;s, Amiina, and Bj&ouml;rk.  Now they have given me the pleasure of listening to Of Monsters and Men and they are absolutely wonderful.<br /><br />If you like other indie bands like Mumford and Sons, Arcade Fire, and The Naked and Famous, than you owe it to yourself to give Of Monsters and Men a good listen.<br /><br />Of Monsters and Men is a six piece Indie Folk band with Nanna Brynd&iacute;s Hilmarsd&oacute;ttir and Ragnar \\"Raggi\\" Þ&oacute;rhallsson and the helm being the two singers of the group.  The music is very uplifting(until you listen to the lyrics of course) and catchy to listen to over and over.<br /><br />Of Monsters and Men has quickly become one of my favorite new artists that I will listen to over and over again.  It's one of the lucky albums which I can listen to completely through and not want to skip through half of the album to get to a good song.

B006M4RN3U|4.0|Fun. is one of my favorite bands, so I was really excited about this album.  I gave this album four stars only because I like Aim and Ignite better.  But I hope that doesn't stop anyone from buying it.  It really is a great album that you can tell the band had fun with (no pun intended). They used a lot of interested effects and sounds to get a very different sound. I always saw a comparison between fun. and Queen and this album only strengthens that opinion.  Some Nights and We Are Young are amazing songs that make you listen to them over and over.  One Foot is really strange in its rhythm which makes you want to listen to it all the more.  Finally, Stars is really entertaining.  It's not the only song that Nate uses the auto-tuner, but it's definitely used the most. I think it's hilarious when he uses it because his voice is already in tune, so it doesn't do too much.  However, some people have  criticized the use of auto-tuning in the album.  These are the songs that stand out most to me, but the others songs are all well done and beautifully written.
B006PHD0RW|5.0|Amazing and addicting game! I didn't have high hopes when I saw the game, but once I started playing it I realized how great it was. There are many different kinds of levels to play, which makes it even more interesting!  Get this game!

B003Y5H5HO|2.0|I ordered this disc for my parents.  When they received it, the first thing they noticed was the non traditional DVD sleeve.  Then they opened it up and it was written on with a marker like you would your photo discs or something like that.  When they began watching it, it was very dark and they couldn't hardly understand the dialogue.  They said it looked like someone was sitting in a movie theater and filmed it and slapped it on the DVD.  What disappointed me is that it was shipped direct from Amazon!  This certainly isn't the quality that I have been used to all these years.  I contacted them this morning and told them I think that they were duped.  I'm writing this in hopes that the customers will be careful when purchasing this item.  Mine might have been a fluke, but I just wanted the information to be on here just in case it involves more than just my copy.

Someone like Seymour \\"The Swede\\" Levov, idolized and admired by many, groomed for tradition and convention, and suddenly catapulted into the horrors wrought by his very own daughter?<br /><br />[[ASIN:0375701427 American Pastoral]] is narrated by Nathan Zuckerman, a character we've met in other works by this author.  He knew The Swede in school and admired him from afar; he was in closer proximity to the younger brother, Jerry.  When Zuckerman has occasion to meet The Swede many years after their graduation, his thoughts and curiosity spring to life and he literally seems to \\"imagine\\" the life of his idol once he has \\"fallen.\\"<br /><br />Paradise Remembered and Paradise Lost are portrayed through these imaginings.  From that point on, we are \\"seeing\\" things from Swede's point of view and watching his life unfurl in slow motion, as he goes back and forth between the past and the present, probing for what triggered the tragedy of his daughter Merry.<br /><br />He thinks about the loss of his daughter, a fugitive after a bomb she allegedly planted:  \\"....the angry, rebarbative spitting-out daughter with no interest whatever in being the next successful Levov, flushing him out of hiding as if he were a fugitive--initiating the Swede into the displacement of another America entirely, the daughter and the decade blasting to smithereens his particular form of utopian thinking, the plague America infiltrating the Swede's castle and there infecting everyone.  The daughter who transports him out of the longed-for American pastoral and into everything that is its antithesis and its enemy, into the fury, the violence, and the desperation of the counterpastoral--into the indigenous American berserk.\\"<br /><br />The story unfolds in great detail and we learn a lot about Lou Levov, the patriarch; about Swede's youth and sports victories; about his \\"mixed marriage\\" with Irish Catholic Dawn Dwyer, former Miss New Jersey; and about the early childhood life of Meredith (Merry) Levov, with much speculation about the origins of her \\"craziness.\\"<br /><br />Reading this multilayered and textured story was tedious, at times, but every detail seemed important to the creation of the final production:  the story of lives and illusions toppling.  I could see how someone for whom life seemed golden would be quite unprepared for a daughter like Merry.  Perhaps many of the events are exaggerated to show the contrast from Swede's point of view.  Definitely for someone couched in the protocol of doing what is expected would be toppled by the rebellions of the 60s.<br /><br />Definitely a worthwhile read for anyone wanting to know more about families in crisis, and also for Roth fans.

I don't like looking at myself period, and 3D really brought it home. Still, I have to say, 3D is better than 2D. This particular version of 3D is very life-like. It's not gimmicky in that it looks like 2D until somebody leans nto the camera and then it's 3D. The technology here is a real leap forward. It makes it look like you're truly there, right on stage with all of us. And together with the 7.1 sound, it's very compelling.
0439023491|5.0|I thought that Catching Fire was a great read! In most series, the sequel is the worst book, however in the Hunger Games Trilogy, the second book, Catching Fire, was almost as good as the first! The beginning is very slow, but the book continues to get better and better as you keep reading. Though some parts were very predictable, there were others that you would never see coming. Overall, I thought that Catching Fire was a great read, and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoyed the Hunger Games.
0061997811|4.0|Think of this as the \\"general interest\\" companion to the much more detailed and comprehensive (and expensive) [[ASIN:0062101897 Harry Potter Page to Screen: The Complete Filmmaking Journey]].  Although there is some behind-the-scenes info in \\"Film Wizardry\\", it is not nearly as technical as \\"Page to Screen\\".

0439023521|5.0|The Hunger Games is a thrilling, exciting read, and I was unable to put it down. It sometimes is gruesome, and occasionally disturbing, but the message of the book is really great. I loved that Katniss was a strong female lead, because there aren't many of those. She was thrown into a difficult situation, but she some how found a way to be positive. Though it was often times hard, Katniss also found a way to control her own destiny, and that was one of the main characteristics that I loved about her. I would suggest this book to anyone who loves to read.

030758836X|5.0|I absolutely love Gillian Flynn's style of writing.  It is very descriptive and clever, and she does a nice job of combining creepy plotlines with dark humor.  \\"Sharp Objects\\" was a flawed but promising debut novel.  But she really stepped up her game with \\"Dark Places\\", which was fantastic.  Now Flynn is releasing her third novel, \\"Gone Girl\\", and I'm happy to say it is as great as I had hoped.<br /><br />It's difficult to describe the plot without revealing spoilers, so here is a general non-spoiler summary:  Nick and Amy Dunne are a typical young professional couple in New York City.  Nick is a laid-back Midwestern guy who moved to the East Coast for his magazine career.  Amy is a born-and-bred Manhattan trust fund baby.  They are a fun and vibrant couple, and described in the book as extremely attractive.<br /><br />However, circumstances lead them to move back to Nick's small hometown (small town living is a common theme in all of Flynn's books).  Amy feels like a fish out of water, but does the best she can.  She isn't that happy, and their marriage is faltering.  And on the morning of their fifth anniversary, Amy disappears.  The remainder of the book describes the search for Amy and the investigation into who was involved in her disappearance.  You'll love this book if you're into watching those true crime mysteries featured on \\"Dateline NBC\\" and \\"48 Hours\\".<br /><br />The book is written in the first-person view, from both the husband and wife's vantage point.  Flynn has fun with this as she gets to be inside the head of both characters.  The beginning portion of the novel was a great insight into a courtship and marriage- she does an excellent job of describing the highs and lows of a relationship.  Despite being a missing person mystery, the book contains quite a bit of dark humor that will have you smiling.<br /><br />The plot moves slowly at times- don't expect a fast-paced thriller with plot twists at the end of every chapter.  But I would still consider this a page-turner and I was very eager to finish it and find out what really happened to Amy.  This novel is both haunting and entertaining.er this a page-turner and I was very eager to finish it and find out what really happened to Amy.  This novel is both haunting and entertaining.

0439023513|5.0|**This is a review essay I had to write for my English class, and I have to post it on a site such as this one.<br /><br /> Mockingjay is the third book in the Hunger Games trilogy and is set far into the future, after war and famine have taken much of the United States.  This book focuses on the ongoing battle between the rebels and the Capitol.  Katniss Everdeen, the victor of the 74th Annual Hunger Games, has become a major key in the plot to overthrow the government.  Her mockingjay pin has become a symbol of the rebellion, and she herself adopts the title after she learns of the impact she can have.<br />This book is structured in such a way that time goes by in months in just three pages.  Instead of focusing on the downtime between conflicts, Collins prefers to keep the reader interested in the suspense than in minute details that won't affect the story.  The introduction of so many new characters was hard to follow at first, but as each of these characters were given back stories, they were easier to understand.<br />Katniss' character becomes a web, and the reader has the opportunity to follow along during her paranoid moments and her realizations.  Instead of learning anything new about her character as the reader would in the first two books, her personality grows.  The reader sees what her present will do for her future.  The third book concentrates more on other people's stories, mainly other Hunger Game victors.  The reader learns exactly how cruel the Capitol is based on these stories.  Katniss is not the only victim of the Capitol, but her constant defiance makes her a target.  The rebels use her for propaganda to gain supporters for their plot to overthrow the crooked president.<br />The climax is difficult to find at a first glance because the second book gives the major climax of the series.  This book explains how Katniss and the other rebels take their country back after constant threats from the Capitol.  Katniss' realization of the rebel army's equally crooked president changes everything in this book.  She is no longer a pretty face used to gain supporters.  She becomes a warrior intent on revenge and justice.  She wants her country back, but she does it for all of the people of Panem, the country that was once the United States.  The action leading up to this point continues until Katniss make a final decision of how to resolve her issue.<br />Katniss became a face of hope the people who had been forced to live in poverty for too long.  Her bravery and instincts make her a role model for others who want to live in a free country.  Her decisions not only affect her but thousands of others.  Though her confusion of who to trust makes her conscience fragile, she picks herself up and makes the biggest decision of her life, and possibly the biggest decision for Panem thus far.  Her decision symbolizes a different kind of hope, a hope that the country can become whole again.  So Katniss goes from being a symbol of hope to bringing that hope to others.<br />The author's choices in structure and character development in this book support the previous two books.  She made the story action-packed and mildly easy to follow while also challenging the reader.  Her decision to reveal Katniss' backstory in the previous books helps this book flow with details of the present.  The reader can almost guess what Katniss will do throughout the story because of the way each book is set up.  The reader becomes one with the character through this understanding.  The story is developed in a way that makes the book difficult to put down until the resolution is fulfilled.  And though there is a conclusion to the series, the reader can still expect surprises in the future of the characters.  The ending might not be a night-to-day sunshine happy one, but it's more realistic.  The openness is refreshing.  The reader gets a conclusion and a look into mystery of what might happen one day.
B002RI9ZQ8|4.0|I usually postpone best sellers I haven't heard before. I may not like to feel I'm going with the crowd. However, once I started reading it, I couldn't stop until the last page. Very easy and involving reading, the author surprises you the whole time. The theme, however, should make most people sick. Having that much violence on the best sellers list for so long tells me something is wrong of what our society chooses to see as leisure.

B004W2UBYW|4.0|A key character of recent history, Steve Jobs made significant contributions to technology development on the last 30 years. The book is a good reference for technology history, if you don´t mind focusing on Job´s (or Apple´s) point of view. Jobs says he decided to allow this biography because he wants people to know also his point of view of the facts. The author follows a jornalistic narrative trying not to be a fans-only book. However, the text ends up doing the last Jobs´s style advertisement for Apple´s products. Nice reading, but be careful not to end wanting to buy more Apple´s stuff.

0307352145|5.0|Susan Cain believes Introverts are undervalued in an extrovert dominated world. Her message is about balance and respect for both.<br /><br />My neighbor is a retired nurse. At home, she tends to be somewhat introverted. We seldom have the kind of conversations referred to as small talk, neither of us being particularly good at it. She tells me when she put on the uniform she became an extrovert and able to speak to her patients about anything.<br /><br />Like me, she craves solitude to recharge.<br /><br />At one point in her book Susan questions whether introversion is a result of nurture or nature. Later she poses the possibility that it doesn't really matter. What matters more, she feels, is what the individual is comfortable with.<br /><br />As a writer, I am most comfortable when working with as few distractions as possible. I find a ringing telephone or even the background noise of a radio, irritating. Unfortunately, I am uncomfortable with promoting myself and my books, especially face to face. I tend to spend 95% of my promotional time online. Also unfortunately, there are times when I need to speak to people about my books face to face. So sometimes, I have to force myself to play the role of an extrovert.<br /><br />Although the author doesn't seem to think the nature nurture aspect is all that important, I find myself fascinated by it. My early childhood was spent with foster parents who often stated, \\"Children are meant to be seen and not heard.\\"  Later, upon meeting some of my birth family, it seemed to me they were pretty extroverted.<br /><br />My husband is also an introvert, yet he manages to do well in the traditionally extroverted career of sales.<br /><br />I found Quiet fascinating, informative, and self affirming. If you are an introvert, it will help you understand and accept who you are. If you have a spouse, friend, or child who is introverted, hopefully it will also help you celebrate and encourage them. It turns out being an introvert isn't a bad thing, as long as you can also function as an extrovert when the situation calls for it.<br /><br />I received this book free from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.'t a bad thing, as long as you can also function as an extrovert when the situation calls for it.<br /><br />I received this book free from Blogging for Books in exchange for my honest review.
B006P0FIB0|4.0|Having read a few negative reviews about this product I was a bit apprehensive about buying it.  But adding a new 3D movie to my colletion is always very tempting.  I ordered the product and as always Amazon shipped it very very promptly.  I popped it in and to my surprise I actually enjoyed this film.  It gave my subwoofers and buttkicker option in my chair a real workout in the scenes with the cannon fire.  The 3D affects were fantastic.  I recently learned about settings for my 3D TV which were somewhat hidden and having adjusted them I have to say watching 3D is fantastic.  I adjusted the brightness and contrast with a test disc and was able to compensate for the affect of the 3D Glasses.<br /><br />I have to say story wise I was quite surprised that Orlando Bloom was not one of the Muskateers and was a villian.  I enjoyed the casting of Christoper Waltz as Cardinal Richelieu, he is always a great villian as in Water For Elephants and Inglorious Bastards.  I did like the casting of the Muskateers in the version with Keifer Sutherland and Oliver Platt.<br /><br />I was happy to see that the door was set for a sequel, which I hope they make.  According to Wikepedia the movie was financially successful.  I think that 3D may catch on as the hardware gets better as I went through two TV's and Three Players before I got to where I was happy and satisfied with the results.<br /><br />If you are worried about whether you would like to add this to your collection, it is always cheaper to rent it first.  Sometimes I think I should follow my own advice as I have at times added a few stinkers to my collection by purchasing rather than renting first.
0375869026|5.0|I heard an interview on NPR with the author, and immediately bought this book. As an educator working with students with special needs and a mother of an eighth and fifth grader, I knew we had to read it. It was such a joy to read. You love the main character but you also get the perspectives of others in his life. I think this weaving of various perspectives is especially pertinent to middle schoolers. I hope that this will quickly be on required reading lists, because it is sure to raise awareness and create empathy in anyone who reads it. It is also well written and references some amazing musicians as a bonus. All around a wonderful book!

Also, compared to his other works, it is a much easier, quicker read, but none the less, still an intriguing and fun book to page through. Some of the topics even take me back to chapters in high school science class...

1741798981|4.0|I am currently planning a trip to the UK and found that this guide, though not the brand I normally gravitate to was a great resource in helping to answer many of my questions and put together a plan for the days we plan to have in London.  The guide breaks down to several sections: Plan your trip, which covers top sites, what you need to know, top itineraries, sites that you might like to visit based on your interests, a month to month schedule of festivals, planning a trip with kids, what you can do for free (yeah, some of the museums are free!), a section on museums & galleries, where to eat, drink and what to do for nightlife, entertainment, shopping, sports and a gay/lesbian section.  Explore London covers the neighborhoods giving you a flavor of each section, tips, sites and their recommendations.  Understanding London, breaks down London today, history, architecture, Literary history, theater & dance, art & fashion, music, film and media.  Lastly is the survival guide with transportation, a directory and index.  At the very end you have a paper map of London which also includes the bus and tube stops.<br /><br />The writing about the sites is clear & very informative, telling you what not to miss, and giving you the admission, the location and website and phone #'s for the site.  I really enjoy having all this at my fingertips as well as some of the London visitor sites, which is helping me to better plan, along with tips and tricks I'm reading about on the tripadvisor site (highly recommended).<br /><br />Overall, I felt better after reading through the book that I was starting to narrow down what I wanted to see and where I felt I wanted to spend my tourist $.  With a city as lively and large as London, with so much to do it can be a bit overwhelming deciding where to start, but as I saw where things were located and what interested me, it started to feel like it was coming together a bit.<br /><br />My one personal \\"con\\" is that I prefer a glossier book.I also generally gravitate to the guides that have more pictures.  The information seems about the same, however, I really do love thumbing through the pictures and enjoy seeing them while I'm trying to decide what goes on the \\"A\\" list, and what will get relegated to the \\"B\\" list if we have time and $.<br /><br />Overall, I feel like this book is a very good start in researching London and one that is not so large that I will feel like I can't tote it along with me in my suitcase.

B005ETA5K2|1.0|This is a bit long but I wanted people to know how this went with me.  There is a lot of Flash no bang.  There IS no one to talk to in the US.  EVERYTHING is through Taiwan.  The on line tech support is non-existent there is a screen there is no one behind it.  You will have to call (cost more then buying another unit from an ethical company this one is not ethical.  If you like messing with stuff to try to get it to work and software that is for another unit but NOT for the unit you bought (they included it so you would buy the unit but it is NOT for this unit) then this Item is for you if you want plug and play PLEASE try another company or the older unit.  I saw an older unit that worked for a whole month before it quit.<br /><br />So here is my experience:<br /><br />  Teats on a Boar Hog<br /><br />  I am doing a lot of traveling I bought an Asus G74S to keep in touch.  After a few trips between Florida and N.J.  I found that Motel Wi-Fi can be week and connection difficult.  On my last trip to FL the 19yr old in the complex had an Alfa Networks Wi-Fi amp.  It was compact and kind of cool looking and it worked.  I decided to get one and saw that they has a 2 watt version.  That would be the AWUS036NHR.  There was also a 9dbi antennae available.  Both together should do the job I thought.  So I bought one from Amazon.  Let me explain that I hold a radio license and  have been building box computers since the late 80's probably built 50 moderately fast machines.  So I have a little knowledge of this stuff.<br /><br />  The unit arrived very fast about 3 days.  It comes in a nice box and packed well.  I read the instructions put in the disk that comes with it.  Installation of the driver failed started over and again it failed the third time windows says installed and working.  The hardware plugged in and installed and working according to windows.  The unit found NOTHING.  My onboard found 15 signals from one bar to 5 bars.  Started over same results.  Did it a 3rd time same.  Went to the web site and a nice SLICK site it is.  Found a new driver and tried again with the same results after trying that 3 times (install uninstall over and over) I get nothing.<br /><br />  Time to find the local 19 yr. old with one working.  I had had the 9dbi antenna the day before and we tried it one the kids Alfa it picked up signals at half the strength.  OK at these high frequencies signals get weird at times.<br /><br />  My young friend tried to get the unit installed and had exactly the same results he could not get it working. Not only that but his 2 month old unit had died and he could not even get the blue light to light. This did not bode well for y purchase.  I got on the web site which has an online tech support.  Well another slick device to suck you in because there is NEVER any one on line.  Their excuse was 12 hrs. difference but that is not true either as I tried all hours for 3 days.  I had bought Skyrim and it was sucking my life into the game so I was up 3 - 4 in the morning I would take a break and check the on line support NEVER was there anyone on line.  So there are 2 items for show the disk and support.<br /><br />  There were 3 choices left send it back (best option) of call Taiwan long distance or email.<br /><br />  I sent an email 2 days later I get an answer from Bill (name changed).  Email below:<br /><br />  Hi Bill,<br /><br />Thanks for contacting Alfa Customer Service, and sorry for the inconvenience have caused on you.<br /><br />May I have following information for us o open your support ticket?<br /> What's the mac # and serial # (both) displayed on the back of your AWUS036NHR?<br /> Can you send me a screen shot from \\"About\\" & \\"Status\\" page from Wireless LAN Utility?<br />The most common problem we have seen so far is incorrect driver on the system, that's why we need to verify the utility version and driver version has installed on your system first.

Would you please remove this driver from your system first before installing another copy.<br /><br />Removing -<br />Right click on Computer -> select Manage -> Device Manager -> expend \\"Network Adapters\\" -> right click on AWUS036NHR and select remove driver.<br />And it's highly recommend to reboot your system after driver is removed, cause we need to make sure the target installation folder is empty.<br /><br />Here is the driver for AWUS036NHR for Windows OS, [...]<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Alfa Network, Inc.<br />TEL: 886-02-22796-8477 ext. 24<br />FAX: 886-02-2796-8478  A<br /><br />Ahhh my laptop needs a driver from Asus ok I'll acceptable reason, it happens, now I'll be on in a few minutes pulling in signals for miles around (slight embellishment).<br /><br />Nope SOS it doesn't work either... New email to Alfa and I am loosing patients.<br /><br />I get this (note the email previous is very fluent in English which did impress me) :<br /><br />  Hi Bill,<br /><br />Is possible that I can use Team Viewer ([...]) to remote assist you? We are 12hrs apart from yourEST, so your 9am is our 9am. Please advise when will you be available for us to remote assist you?<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Alfa Network, Inc.<br />TEL: 886-02-22796-8477 ext. 24<br />FAX: 886-02-2796-8478<br /><br />I told him I was traveling but would be in N.J. Saturday.  I get this back.  I am assuming here that he would be on line which is on the web site.<br /><br />HI Bill,<br /><br />Apologized for the inconvenience have caused on you.<br /><br />We are only aware that different version of driver may have impact on the performance for AWUS036NHR. So I was proposed to use Team Viewer to remote assist you in order to find out what's the real problem. I'll reserve my schedule on following Monday morning 9am (that'll be your Sunday 9pm) for remote session, please send me email if you need to cancel this session.<br /><br />Awaiting for good news.<br /><br />Best Regards,<br /><br />Alfa Network, Inc.<br />TEL: 886-02-22796-8477 ext. 24<br />FAX: 886-02-2796-8478<br /><br />Well this is 9 pm on Easter Sunday but I was willing to slip away from my relatives and get the unit running.  I am not a Bata tester apparently.<br /><br />  To be safe I logged on at 9 am just to be sure.  There was no one there of course but I was there just in case.  While there I clicked the on line help.  It will tell you need software which in the selection screen it is Skype ok fine I wanted to try Skype so I install it.  But he said Team Viewer which I had never heard of so I did a search.  Yep there is Team Viewer so I installed it and registered it.  However I find that you need their 10 or 12 digit id number to talk to him and he did not give me that nor does he have mine as I had not registered till that moment.  It would do no good to email since that is delayed.<br /><br />  At 8:45 I get on line and waited with Skype up and Team Viewer up at 9:27 pm feeling the fool for even believing these people after all EVERYTHING is Illusion everything but the unit is for showto make you feel like you would get support but you won't hey they have your money by now so what do they care.<br /><br />  When I was 30 I enjoyed having problems I learned things that way .... In fact if one of my machines ran fine for a long while I got bored with it.  That was 32 yrs. ago and Now I want plug and play.  Did I expect maybe some messing with it, but I expected to in the end it would work.  At this point 3 weeks or so getting lip service with no results into this thing.  Just about everything is fake i.e. The disk and the on line help and the updated drivers it actually fraudulent.  If you like a challenge this unit is for you.  If you expect plug and play buy a lotto ticket you have way better chances.<br /><br />  To review the disk that comes with the unit is useless (and they know it), the on line help is for show there is no man behind the curtain, They will schedule an on line help but not how to connect as they don't uses the on line help on their web site, give you no code that apperently Team Viewer needs.<br /><br />  Buy a unit from a company that has been around a while they probably work.  If you are in to cool looking stuff that probably will not work easily prepare to spend some time experimenting.  AND remember that my friends lasted about 1 month before it died.<br /><br />  Needless to say I will be sending the well-made Teat back to Amazon.  I do care if I never see another product from the unethical if not fraudulent company again.<br /><br />  Amazon is great they are taking it back.  Oh there are other reviews that back up much of my experience I should have listened.  The 9dbi antennae can be returned but cost as it went through a different company. However in my experience it had 1/2 the signal received then my on board and the 5dbi that is came with it should have had 2x+ signal.  I will keep it the way it attaches is universal and may be useful anyway the expense of sending it back is not worth the effort as it costs almost as much as I paid for it.  It may be that the low cost of these units they figure no one will bother to return them they do not preform as stated.
B004EPYZV2|3.0|I would wait for the other version that includes the full IMAX scenes, not the cropped version.  don't know why Brad Bird decided to go this route...but I am very disappointed.<br /><br />the Amazon stated aspect ration of 1.85:1 is just plain wrong, it should be 2.40:1
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|very addictive and fun to play when your bored. never gets boring either and interesting I gave itfour stars because its fun
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a awesome game it is just like Mario but for a lepricon. this is a need to get game
B0063IH60K|5.0|I love this game. Great graphics.  Easy and fun to play.  My kids like to play this solitaire game best of all.
B0041KKYEM|2.0|I suppose it was inevitable that someone would make a movie about the seamier side of ballet dancing, since everything else has been tried. What's next, the lustier side of chess tournaments? Now THAT would be interesting. ;- But to give one example of how the movie unsuccessfully tries to ratchet up the seamy and sensuous side of things, the scene where the ballet master is groping Natalie Portman to show her that she is supposed to seduce him during that dance and then tells her that she should go home and masturbate was ludicrous in the extreme. Yeesh. I'm certainly no prude but who comes up with these ideas, anyway? First-year movie-script writing students who think a little sex will sell even the worst turkey of a movie?<br /><br />To be fair, the movie does has its moments and the acting is more than competent; I just wish it was in the service of a better movie. Natalie Portman is always good of course even if the movie itself is less than stellar. I suppose there has to be some truth to it what with all those young, perfectly toned bodies running around. But for me, a movie about the steamier side of ballet (however true or not) just didn't work very well. I'm not a ballet fan (although I know it takes extreme athletic abilities) so maybe that's the problem. Others mileage may vary.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|fun game Wye. I find myself bored I would mention to just play and see how you like it. that is all
B000W7JWUA|5.0|Settlers is a GREAT game.  It is a good introduction into the \\"nerdy\\" genre of board games, and can either be played by dumb luck or with cunning strategy.  While the instructions may be longer than just the inside of the box lid it is NOT a difficult game to learn.  In fact, in my opinion the instruction book that it comes with is overly extensive and makes it seem like it is more difficult than it actually is (does the instruction book really need a 3 page glossary?).  We've been playing this game for quite some time now and have introduced many people to it.  Everyone has loved it (and most have ended up buying the game for themselves too).
B0018QQQK8|5.0|This book captivated my interest from the start and really had me thinking. I would highly reccommend this book! I thoroughly enjoyed this entertaining book.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|Great game. A lot like Mario! Want to keep playing all day! Great for any age! Awesome game! Great graphics!
B0064T6LV8|2.0|its ok I guess its gets on my nerves alot like onetime I hit upward. and it went down don't get it :()
B007PTJOV0|4.0|its super Mario bros but a leprecham very fun<br />it is easy most of the time but sometimes challening<br />great game for free
B004SRPXWQ|3.0|This was fun, but I tried downloading it two times. I could never get it to come up again so I could play with it again. Dont know if I was doing something wrong or what. I got it on the free items, so at least I didnt have to pay for it and didnt get it.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|oh my goodness this is a REALLY good game, and I enjoy it all the time. I cant believe no one has thought of this before!! beautiful graphics, even though at some small times hard to control on my fire. oh well. thats life, right? :)
B007PTJOV0|5.0|I loved this game. It will make you laugh and it keeps you on your toes. I would recommend this one to everyone. Fun, fun,fun.
B007PT3QOQ|4.0|Really liked this game.I dont like having to buy the coins.Easy to play and my kids really liked playing this.
B004I8WD6E|5.0|This case is awesome! Not as \\"protected\\" as it would be with something bulkier, like an otter box, (which I also highly recommend), but perfect for everything else besides someone with a very active lifestyle. I'm a teacher and this case is perfect, and comes with a screen protector as well. My 2-year dropped the phone while I had it in this case and it was just fine. No worries.
1595827684|4.0|Let me start off by saying that I am a huge Mass Effect fan; played them all and was excited to read this. It goes into detail really well about a lot of the things in all 3 games. The art is very well done and each page is devoted to a single item or character, etc. Not only does it show the concept art, but it goes into how the drawing was created and the thought processes behind it. I was really surprised that it only offered 1 spoiler for the last game, but it turned out that after I beat the game and went back to read the part about the last game, the spoiler I thought I saw was not in the game. Overall it's a great book for a diehard fan.<br /><br />Reviewed by Kole for Book Sake.
0316777722|5.0|David Sedaris has the uncanny ability to remember every weird, funny thing that ever happened to him, then the wonderful talent to put it all into words.  All of his  books are laugh out loud must reads!  I would not advise reading David Sedaris on public transportation unless you don't mind strangers asking \\"what's so funny\\"?  My daughter told me about this wonderful book, then I had to get all the others, this purchased hard cover is for my Mom.  Mr. Sedaris' humor reaches every generation.
1608870081|4.0|I'm really happy I got this book! My five year old loves it and its really just a very artistic and interesting book! If you're any kind of Harry Potter fan you won't be disappointed. The only concern is that the binding is already tearing on mine and I've only had it a few days but other than that its still a good buy.
B005XN0SGU|4.0|Works great with the Kindle Fire to view cbr comics.  I've tested several other comic viewers from both the Amazon appstore and from \\"side\\" loading free versions found elsewhere.  Perfect Viewer is worth the purchase.  For the price, Perfect Viewer rivals most desktop cbr viewers in terms of simplicity and range of options.  Haven't tried ComiCat yet, so can't compare.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|Love Lady Antebellum and love the ease of downloading music.  Quick, easy and great price because of sale that day.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Once I picked up the book it was difficult to set down.  This is an easy read that will keep you captivated throughout.  I highly recommend reading this book for teenagers and adults.
0307593312|2.0|This book is extremely long. I ended up skipping whole paragrpahs that did not matter at all to the central story. Whoever editted this book did a horrid job.  I see it in 2 parts....the first half of the book I was enthralled. I wanted to know where this was all going, hoping that all the time I was putting it would pay off and I'd see what the connection betw Aomame and Tengo was. But once I got to the 2nd half of the book and realized there was absolutely no logic to the story, I really struggled. The first half of the book set up Aomame as an extremely level headed, logical, smart woman. All of that went out of the window after she met up with Leader. She just 'believed' all these things he was telling her that made 0 sense. The little people? The maidens? Just way too odd. And the love story was extremely thin. They didn't even know each other and held hands for a second, yet they were in love for 20 yrs? And they never explained why Fuka Eri was the way she was. Would she ever not 'perceive' and beable to live a normal life? I just did not enjoy this book and do not understand how it was on the 'Best Books of 2011' lists.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|best game ever what a rush my hands are shaking and sweating i can barly type on my kindle<br />,
0553801473|1.0|I think all the disappointments with the last two books have been spelled out by others rather well. I waited until book 5 to redeem book 4, but after just completing it tonight, I am done. I have to find another series to start now, any suggestions?
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|this is my favorite game its so adicting you will love thos game its worth everything but there is a thing that says you have to download... download its not a scam
0345803485|1.0|This book started as a Twilight fan fiction cross BDSM smut and it really shows. (Smut, for those who don't know, is basically porn for female readers) I couldn't finish Twilight and I couldn't finish this book either. If you want pure smut, you can find shorter stories online that get right to the point. If you want a good story, don't bother, this is worse than Twilight. If Amazon had self publishing a few years earlier, fan fiction about Harry Potter dating Draco Malfoy would do better than this crap.<br /><br />Please, please, read a free sample chapter before you waste money on this.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a nice app. The verse selector could be improved if all the books were available in one screen instead of scrolling through the whole list. It would also be nice to have commentaries available. I especially like the reading plans.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|This app is awesome it can even read to you!<br />If your just starting out with the bible perfect app!
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I love having Pinterest for my craft projects, and was thrilled to find Evermore, a similar app which allows me to keep up with my receipts, notes, and lists from both my computer and Kindle. The layout is nice, and learning how to use the program was simple! I haven't had any problems with it yet.
B00000JLWW|5.0|Some movies become a part of you.  They are just so enrooted in your heart that despite their obvious, sometimes glaring flaws, you can't help but openly adore them.  `Titanic' is one of those movies.  It became a revelation upon its initial release back in 1997, and it continues to be considered one of the most beloved films in recent memory; maybe of all time.  It's generations `Gone with the Wind', `Titanic' is a sweeping romantic epic that has captured the hearts of millions and, as we all promised upon the film's conclusion, we have never let go.<br /><br />I subject myself to `Titanic' roughly once a year.  It is a struggle because the minute Rose leaps from that lifeboat back into the sinking ship my tear ducts begin active duty and it's rather embarrassing, especially since I can't prevent it from happening.  With the release of the 3D version of the film I took the opportunity to try crying in public, considering that I have not seen the film on the big screen (it was released when I was twelve and my parents forbid it).  I was ecstatic, as was my wife.  This is just such a BIG movie, and event in itself, and you kind of have to see it on the big screen at least once; right?  With my bulky black glasses on, I settled into my seat (directly in the center of the theater thanks to arriving thirty minutes ahead of time) and prepared myself for the adventure once more.<br /><br />It started and I literally got Goosebumps.<br /><br />As I watch `Titanic', I am not blinded to the film's faults; for there are really far too many of them too ignore.  The script is atrocious.  The dialog is ridiculous (I hate it when characters detail out large amounts of information out of cinematic necessity despite the fact that NO ONE TALKS LIKE THAT).  The acting is spotty at best (Winslet is decent in the beginning, great in the closing).  Really, the film truly excels in two areas; the technical grandeur and James Cameron's dynamic direction (yes, I'm a fan of his win, even if he is not my particular winner that year).  Watching the cast muddle through such poorly conceived conversations and watching the pathetic plot points unravel could have easily became a chore.  I mean, what other film would be forgiven such horribly mediocre offerings?<br /><br />I can't think of one; and yet it doesn't matter.<br /><br />`Titanic' works because all these elements, no matter how mediocre they can be on their own, come together in a way that creates cinematic magic.  The chemistry between the two leads is undeniable and the whole idea of their unlikely love affair surpassing tragedy and `meaning' something becomes such a strong driving force for the film that one cannot help but become emotionally wrapped up in the film, despite what number of views one is on.<br /><br />No, `Titanic' is just that one movie that gets a free pass because it is more than a movie; it is an event all its own.  The film becomes a part of you.  When Celine Dion belts out the chorus lines to `My Heart Will Go On' you can feel the emotional connection well up in your heartstrings and it's really all over from that point forward.  It doesn't make sense and it probably isn't deserved, but millions of warm blooded human beings agree; `Titanic' is one of those movies that defies logic.  Even now, fifteen years later, it still sends chills down my spine and extracts large amounts of salty tears from my eyes.he is not my particular winner that year).

B004T4LUPW|5.0|I am very happy with the ease and simplicity of this app. Brings a calender to the Kindle Fire. The calender month view is great and I have the agenda view set as default. Well worth the money.
B003Y5H574|4.0|Hubby & I enjoyed this movie. It's funny & smart. I felt bad for Steve's character & the ending was up in the air - I'd like to think he didn't get back with the wife, :)<br /><br />The ending was hilarious & totally unexpected. We were shocked then kept laughing. Talk about seven degrees of separation or something akin!<br /><br />Sad & cringe-worthy at times during Steve's character's depression but overall a great movie.
B005K17RU0|5.0|Use this constantly. Like that it works in background on my KF. Map feature with Radar is awesome would like to see a satellie view as well.
B004EPZ084|5.0|I'm in my mid-30's, hubby is mid-40's & we both thought this was hilarious Perfect date movie to get away from the kids. I'm shocked at Jennifer A as a femme fatale, but it worked. The cast was perfect, it's just a wonderful movie. Kinda like the original hangover, only a bit tamer.
B002BWP4A6|5.0|This is a long - almost 2 1/2 hrs - look at life in a northeast German village, taken as a microcosm of Germany in her transition from the rigidities of the 19th to the violence of the 20th centuries.  The geographic placement is clear from the Junker system depicted, the name of the county seat (Teglitz - a Wendish name) and the presence of Polish farm laborers.  The story is told in retrospect by an old man who, in the movie, is the young schoolmaster, the one element not corrupted. The leading characters/institutions - the Baron and his wife, the doctor, the pastor, the police  - are shown as heartless and shallow; it is they, and their extensions (e.g., the Baron's son and the midwife's son), who are the targets of the sometimes lethal attacks perpetrated  by those who must live under them.  American reviewers of this movie have seen this theme and interpret it simplistically as nothing more than shoving the German nose into the dreck of Naziism yet once again - and this may indeed by part of the message.  (It would appear that throwing the Baron's son into the river and stealing his whistle might have more to do with a depiction of the SECOND dictatorship on German soil in the 20th century).  Overall it would seem that the message is rather a general one, perhaps equally applicable to the French and Russian revolutions - that a violent response to the inequities of society may lead to even greater injustice.  This village, after all - on the eastern march - would have been obliterated with the destruction of the Oder-Neisse provinces in 1945.  And yet the movie begins and ends with a chorale of \\"A Mighty Fortress\\" - at the end, with the congregation, the pastor sitting as one of them, viewed from the altar - the divine perspective. Surely this is the appropriate response to the slings and arrows of this world.
B004EPZ0BG|4.0|Why, why, WHY! do practically every romantic comedy are ruined with a dreadfully cheesy ending?<br /><br />This movie hooked me - it was sexy, sassy & funny, with witty bantering. Mila Kunis was really good especially. I loved it - until the final reconciliation scene. Ugh! Double UGH! What a way to ruin a good movie. Only that part garnered the cheese factor - I didn't find it romantic at all. I guess I'll just skip that scene.<br /><br />Otherwise, the movie was wonderful. I think there's another movie with the same plot with Natalie Portman & Ashton Kutcher but I like this one better.
B003Y5H5HY|2.0|I was very disappointed with the film.  The Swedish film felt so much more powerful to me than this American release.  I viewed it with 3 others and we felt as if the first half dragged on and on.  The scene where the protaganist revolts and tricks her rapist is very toned down in the American release as compared with the Swedish version and not nearly as powerful or surprising.  The acting is all fine and the desaturatied colors fit the bleakness of the characters and story lines but there is little use of your surrounds made in this very dialouge driven film.  There were certainly many scenes such as the motorcycle being driven on the roads that could have made use of your 5.1 theater system.  The video transfer is fairly free of noise and rates a 4, the audio a 2.  The film itself, especially when compared with the Swedish version is a 2 at best.<br />All my movie reviews are of this nature and focus only on the quality of the transfer to BluRay so check them and see if they are of help as well.Hopefully, this review has been of some help to you in determining your purchase, hope I am on the correct path with a review of the transfer quality as opposed to providing plot summaries.<br />Thanks

B007PT3QOQ|1.0|I don't know how the game plays when it says I have no Internet connection when I have full bars. I also tried the web and the appstore (obviously) and it worked, so its obviously a bug in the app. This makes it unplayable until they fix it.

B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This novel touched me deeply. While I've not lost anyone particularly close to me from the \\"dreaded cancer\\", I feel as though I have witnessed something very real in reading this account of the three teens who live and die because of it.  Their relationships with each other are beautifully described. I haven't had a good cry like this in a long time.  I only wished that they had found the living God in their time of suffering.  I kept wanting to pray for them!
0307719774|4.0|I've read the other reviews on this journal, and so I thought I would add my two cents.<br /><br />When I purchased the journal, I was fully aware of the size, so when I received it, I wasn't surprised at all.  In fact, I found that while travelling, this journal took up such little space in my baggage, that the small size was actually a pro.<br /><br />As for the book not laying flat, I have found that it really doesn't need to.  If you can't hold it open for a few moments to write a sentence or two, well, then I suppose you shouldn't buy it.  This really isn't a big deal to me.<br /><br />Finally, I do think that adding a ribbon would've been a good idea, but I just threw a bookmark in the journal, and *poof* problem solved!<br /><br />This is just my opinion, but I do have to say that for the price, this journal is adorable and makes a great gift too!
B001F6ZIXC|5.0|The crispness of this show creates distance from modern television.  Nowhere else can viewers relish such tortured characters so willingly.  I don't have any interest in bikes or biker gangs but the personal relationships enticed me.  People are not good or bad.  It gets much, much murkier and difficult for the morally-inclined.

B001G8WXH8|5.0|In \\"Stone Cold,\\" David Baldacci gives the reader one of his best books to date!  He does an amazing job of weaving a complex series of sub plots, which are all intertwined around our fearless group of heroes called the Camel Club.  Baldacci masterfully builds multiple settings and additionally creates a group of interesting and complex characters about  whom the reader actually cares.  In many ways, this third book in the series is almost a continuation of the second book, \\"The Collectors.\\"  Here in \\"Stone Cold,\\" Oliver Stone and the Camel Club are back in their most dangerous adventure yet, a battle on multiple fronts.  Casino king and crime boss Jerry Bagger from \\"The Collectors\\" is hunting Annabelle Conroy who conned him out of 40 million dollars in retaliation for what Bagger did to her family (see \\"The Collectors\\").  Stone and his colleagues Reuben, Milton, and Caleb marshal all their resources to protect Annabelle; their Secret Service friend, Alex Ford, returns in a larger roll as well.<br /><br />Although not absolutely necessary, I would strongly recommend reading \\"The Collectors\\" before reading \\"Stone Cold.\\"  As mentioned before, \\"Stone Cold\\" is almost a continuation of \\"The Collectors,\\" so I would read it first for greater understanding.  In fact, I would even recommend that \\"The Camel Club\\" (1st book in this series) should be read first.  \\"The Camel Club\\" really establishes the main characters that are also used in the series and helps to define the personal characteristics and traits of each member of \\"The Camel Club;\\"  the first book explains why they call themselves the Camel Club as well ( near the end).  Although I have only read the first three of this series, this is unquestionably one of those series that makes a lot more sense for greater understanding and background to read them in order, but it is not absolutely critical.

B00008ACIN|5.0|The vinyl came a few weeks early, and came in great shape and I very happy with it. I love it, its perfect.
B004XJRQUQ|4.0|By now you've likely heard the gist of the first, eponymous, Hunger Games through the publicity surrounding the movie. The trilogy is enjoyable as a continuous read because of how the story evolves over the course of the novels, with the characters and events developing - at least, those who survive. While I think that the first novel was written with the possibility of a second in mind, the second was certainly written so that the third would follow quite quickly.<br /><br />I read the trilogy in just under six weeks, with some sections proceeding much more quickly and easily than others. I will say without question that the books are exciting - not only because of continually-surprising events and an often-fascinating world, but also because of Collins' pacing and timing. She makes some chapters impossible to simply set the Kindle down without continuing for just one more ... or three or four. I really have to point out that although the first-person narrative is through Katniss, who is quite an introvert and who relates much of the backstory through asides and interior conversations, Collins does a very good job of keeping the story moving. It rarely drags in the first novel, aside from one long stretch in the middle that goes a bit too long for building dramatic tension and really ends up inspiring a frustrated \\"get on with it!\\" from the reader.<br /><br />While many reviewers took away a deep sense of connection to Katniss or one of the other characters, all of whom lose so much over the course of the novels, or a breathless love story which was certainly present but just not my forte, I was most impressed by grander themes of dehumanization and the risk of drifting towards nihilism in the pursuit of power. The two conflicting societies - Capitol and District - were such an incredible contrast of color and tedium, excess and insufficiency, trivium and survivalism, that they constantly reminded one of the tension underlying this otherwise harmonious if lethal arrangement. The constant obsession on image and the cults of hero worship that continued to emerge must be a withering commentary on moral choices that value form over substance.<br /><br />There were some minor detractions from the story. One is Katniss herself - she's far too intelligent and well-spoken for one who grew up in the poorest District with schooling that prepared her for life in the coal mines. Her vocabulary is very near Collins' own, which is to say impressive, and there are times the fourth wall becomes transparent and I see not the conflicted and desperate teen but rather the author and a life experience, especially in matters of love, that brings the author's maturity in focus.<br /><br />The other is hard to explain without giving away the premise of the second novel. Suffice to say, I really do wonder if Collins had known the latter two novels would be published, if she'd add some foreshadowing into the first novel to allude to certain events that arise very quickly and completely, so much so that when they appear the reader asks \\"how did I miss that?\\" Of course, certain others in the novels missed it completely as well, and for good reasons.<br /><br />After so much lit crit, I'll say what matters most. I really enjoyed reading this trilogy.rangement.

0062082353|4.0|Nonfiction! What is this black magic? You all must be thinking that I'm a pretty contradictory person. I don't read books about dragons. I love James Maxey's GREATSHADOW. I don't read anthologies. I love ARMORED by John Joseph Adams. Now I'm going to tell you that I don't read nonfiction. Ever. But it turns out that I really liked AMERICAN SNIPER written by Navy SEAL Chris Kyle, with Scott McEwen and Jim DeFelice. An autobiography about a Navy SEAL? Well if you're going to read nonfiction you might as well read the most exciting nonfiction available.<br /><br />Chris Kyle served as a Navy SEAL during Operation Iraqi Freedom. Kyle and his platoon were part of some of the thickest fighting the US Armed Forces were involved in, from pacifying Fallujah to cleaning out Sadr City. AMERICAN SNIPER is an unapologetic, patriotic, and personal look at the conflict in the Middle East from the perspective of a special forces sniper.<br /><br />AMERICAN SNIPER begins with Kyle's first sniper kill and then follows his path from childhood all the way through his enlistment until he leaves the Navy in 2009. Reading about the way Kyle grew up and the life he led before becoming a SEAL really gives insight into what sort of person it takes to be a special forces operator. Kyle is a legitimate cowboy, a Texan, and a \\"good ol' boy\\". He's the sort of guy that you would really like to buy a beer and it shows through his writing. The autobiography is broken up into chapters with sub-chapters, making for quick easy reading and the tone of the narrative is so laid back that it's really more like having a conversation than reading.<br /><br />The personal bits are all very compelling, Kyle's wife Taya even writes small excerpts here and there that add an even more delicate touch. The parts written from Taya's perspective are often about the toll Kyle's enlistment and service took on the family. These parts serve as a reminder that SEALs aren't just warriors. They are sons and brothers and fathers and husbands as well. But enough about the touchy-feely stuff.<br /><br />The legend of Chris Kyle is really what makes this book a must read. During his service, Kyle wracked up 160 confirmed sniper kills. This is just the confirmed kills, but the number claimed is actually 255. Kyle doesn't once brag about his tally, in fact he is completely humble about his whole experience as a SEAL. Kyle fought in Iraq, not for any medals, but to protect his country. Kyle doesn't regret any of his kills and he refuses to make apologies for what he has done. Some people are likely to be offended by the candid nature of the autobiography, but I doubt many of these people are likely to buy a book about snipers in the Iraq War to begin with.<br /><br />AMERICAN SNIPER is a great read. If you are curious about Navy SEALs and the way their operations have changed with the emergence of the War on Terror this is the book for you. This is a very personal story with no shortage of action, humor, mourning, and hope. If you have a problem with patriotism you should skip this one, but I found it to be a fun time.<br /><br />Here's a thanks to all who serve in America's Armed Forces for their service and sacrifice.<br /><br />Recommended Age: 16+<br />Language: Chris Kyle cusses like the cowboy he is but he doesn't overdo it. Still be warned.<br />Violence: Yes, sometimes morbid but never gruesome.<br />Sex: None.<br /><br />Nick Sharps<br />Elitist Book Reviewsthers and husbands as well.

1400032717|5.0|This was recommended at Audible.Com, based on my daughter's interests. I listened to it this weekend (initially because my daughter has Asperger's)and found it to be delightful. I very much enjoyed the point of view. It seems so rare to see a protagonist with some kind of disability. My daughter loves that Percy Jackson is dyslexic & has ADHD (she too is severely dyslexic, which is why we LOVE audiobooks) because she can identify with him. I hope we see more characters like the young actor in Breaking Bad that has cerebral palsy, not played for sympathy, but as part of the diversity of our population.
B0054PSY2W|5.0|This Coen brothers' retelling of Homer's \\"The Odyssey\\" is an Academy Award winning modern day classic and the Blu-ray remastering does it justice. My living room theater set-up is reference quality (Integra DTR-50.3, Jamo Concert series surround, Sherbourn 7x200 amp) and I'm something of an audiophile. The ambient sound in this movie has always been in my top 5 and the remastered DTS-HD doesn't disappoint. For two great examples of what true surround can sound like, skip ahead to the scene in which the three escapees are roasting gophers over a fire and a group of born-agains march through their camp like ghostly apparitions to a river baptism. The other great scene is the clan meeting that they infiltrate nearer the end of the movie.<br /><br />As far as the video I would tend to say it's on par with the audio or possibly better. If I remember correctly this movie was one of the first shot on digital media instead of film back in 2000 or 2001. It gave the Coens more control over the saturation effects they used to bleed out the color schemes of the movie, giving it that dusty, southern summer look in yellows and greys. Even though it was shot in digital I believe they still used a 24 frames per second format (or the digital equivalent, anyway). It seemed pretty flawless to me and thanks to the Academy Award winning cinematography it's strengths are on display.<br /><br />I won't get into the actual content of the movie and I have only seen a few bits of the extras so I can't honestly comment on those either but for the blu-ray remastered audio/video I'd say this movie should get a 9.5 out of 10 and that's because I don't think anything will ever be a perfect 10.

B0042J6VUS|3.0|I guess I am to blame for not reading the feedback but this does not fit phones larger than the iPhone, which most of them are.  I ended up gluing in a piece to make the arm longer so it fits my phone.  If you don't mind doing a little work you can make it worth the 7 bucks it costs if you have a bigger phone.  I gave 3 stars because mine was not made cheaply as some of the reviews have said and I did not read the reviews before i got it.  It will not stand up with the phone in portrait mode as shown in the picture.

B000YAX3P0|3.0|I'm not generally a big fan of pop music, and until two weeks or so ago all I knew of Amy Winehouse was the stuff that you couldn't avoid hearing in the US news in the last couple of years about her drinking and drug use until her death.  But I accidentally ran across her performance of Stronger Than Me at a 2004 Fender Stratocaster anniversary \\"Strat Pack\\" concert.  Obviously she had no business being part of that show, but I still thought it was a pretty fantastic performance, so I took a chance and bought the album.<br /><br />So, I've listened to this several dozen times in the last week, and I think the album is sort of a mixed bag.  There are some good songs with good interesting music.  But there are also a number of annoying and irritating songs mixed in.  F me pumps would top that list for me, with In My Bed coming in a close second.  She's clearly a talented and creative singer, but honestly that alone just doesn't do it for me, and the mildly bland music, and run of the mill studio musicians aren't up to the challenge.

0345803485|5.0|I have never written a review for anything...ever. However, this book...this book, I cannot believe how absolutely engaging and exceptional this story was. I have been reading it over and over and over and over...the connection between Ana and Christian is almost tangible. It's as though he is coming alive for the first time, maturing and growing and watching that journey is enthralling. It's hard to believe that he isnt much older. I really hope that Mrs. James continues to write, in fact if she re-writes this book or the entire trilogy from Christian's standpoint I would buy it too even though its the same story because I would love to know what he was thinking and feeling instead of what Ana thought he was thinking or feeling. This book and this trilogy is a definite keeper in whatever format you want to get it in, paperback or e-book.
014062029X|3.0|Though I expected sadness and misery, I was hoping for something more profound at the ending than \\"Happiness was but the occasional episode in a general drama of pain.\\"<br /><br />  This is a many chaptered narrative that shows how the results of good intentioned-or-not mistakes can lead to personal ruin.  The reader also will lose all respect for the main character.<br /><br />  A problem with Victorian Period literary giants I have is their long sentences.  I counted one at 82 words.<br /><br />  Would only recommend this to someone who likes a challenging read (big words and colloquial language) and who doesn't mind a depressing, predictable story.<br /><br />  \\"The sun was resting on the hill like a drop of blood on an eyelid.\\"  Best line.
B005JE7WKI|5.0|have watched it twice already. and the back and forth comedy is hilarious.did not know these guys were this good.
0307474259|5.0|I think the author has succeeded immensely in writing a book simple enough and clear enough for anyone to understand. He is not selling anything, is without selfish agendas (hidden or not), so that if people implement what he writes about, he will have helped many people and society at large. This book is unambiguous in what makes us fat, and how to lose weight. He is very convincing that we can get healthier along with  reducing the chances of certain chronic diseases if we minimize or avoid most carbs.  I've read some other books in this genre and though some have stated very similar things, they have not seemed so clear and so full of empirical evidence and explanations as to how so many in this country have gained weight or become obese. I have been wanting to lose about 10-15 lbs. and was frustrated with the calories in/ calories out approach and in the couple of weeks since reading this after making some changes to reduce carbs, I've lost almost half of my goal and believe I will get to my desired weight quite soon. It has been a significant change to reduce or cut out breads, pasta, sweets etc, but surprisingly not as tough as I would have imagined. It's been a choice that requires self discipline on my part and I feel no room to maneuver and play games or rationalize what I eat. I understand what I need to do to be at the weight I want. For me this is the most compelling, convincing and the best written book on this topic.
0393327345|5.0|This is a great book overall. The first chapter almost instantly catches your attention and the story is very dark and cynical. To me as a student still in college it taught me that things can change no matter how redudant, boring, or horrible your life is you have the power to make it happen in anyway you want. In the book however the narrator does this in a very drastic way. Other than that I completely reccomend this book, you can definetly see the movie first and still like the book. For me I didn't see the whole movie but I did see parts of it that really caught my eye. Inconclusion this is a really great read that would degfinetly change your perspective on life if you so wish too.

For that price, I do not care if my rugrats perform lobotomies on her.<br /><br />The lowdown:<br /><br />Hair: Very hairsprayed to keep the bob intact. If possible, check out and compare all of these dolls in your immediate area. We got two- one with big chunks of white hair, and one with lots of dark highlights. They look very different from one another. Pass on the ones with a dose of very mixed white and black hair, as it looks matronly (i.e.gray). The best part- the hair of this doll \\"glows\\" with a bluish, radioactive sheen in sunlight.<br /><br />Shoes and jewelry: On snugly; sensible. (No added accessories with this one; just her stand.)<br /><br />Outfit: A little risque. Fabric print is of storm clouds with lightning bolts. Top of bathing suit is tied behind Frankie's neck; bottom closes with Velcro. Velcro on bottom cover-up could be wider and tougher.<br /><br />What more can I say- she's the monster version of Edie Sedgwick. Very \\"it\\"!

Even though if you are not a baseball fan, but I would recommend this because it takes you to the depth of what a baseball general manager does. It is a great family movie because it is for everyone to enjoy. Definitely give this movie a shot! Great product.

B0072GPQNG|3.0|I am a sucker for sentimental animal movies so I would have been quite happy with a sappy tear jerker.  Also, having read the book which, although poorly written in general, was compelling in its war scenes, and considering the Academy Award nominations, I was anticipating watching War Horse with great enthusiasm.  However, I was disappointed.<br /><br />On the plus side, I thought the film was lovely and technically very well done. The film was tastefully done with none of the gratuitous violence that plague movies today.  The animal training was brilliant and the animals were very well cared for according to numerous newspaper and magazine articles I read on the Internet.  Indeed, one of the horses who portrayed Joey most frequently was a failed race horse who has found a new calling as a successful movie star. By far, the horses were the best actors in this movie and they and the cinematography were the saving grace of the film.<br /><br />Unfortunately, for me, the movie had more negatives than positives. From the beginning, the movie was boring and sterile.  I wanted to become involved in this film, but the acting lacked the emotion, intensity, and sincerity I needed to do so.  I felt like a spectator rather than a participant.  This was especially true in the relationship between Albert and Joey.  You can tell when a person genuinely loves animals and Jeremy Irvine didn't show that.  Where is Roddy McDowell when you need him?<br /><br />The story line also seemed to lack continuity.  The two German brothers did not appear in the book and did little to move the plot forward in the movie.  The young French girl and her grandfather played a more prominent part in the book, but in the movie, their role was so minor it only added to the disjointed feel of the film.  It wasn't until the death of Topthorn that the movie gained continuity and I could become involved in the plot.  The scene in which the British and German soldiers worked together to free Joey was the most compelling part of the movie, but even in that scene the acting seemed forced and lacking in sincerity.  In general, the actors gave the impression they were merely reciting their lines rather than feeling them.  Where was the charisma?<br /><br />All said, I would like to thank Mr. Spielberg for creating this tribute to the horses who served in the first World War.  Millions of horses and hundreds of thousands of dogs served and died in that most horrific of wars and they deserve to be remembered.
0930289234|5.0|A complex and multi-layered story. Truly, a comic book for those who feel they have outgrown comic books. Almost every type of hero is represented, from the vigilante, Batman-style, hero, to the straight-laced, Superman-style hero. The end of the book presents an ethical dilemma that must be addressed when the human race has reached the extent of their shelf-life. That is the best part of the book. Right and wrong is always depicted as a fuzzy gray area, and the reader is left to determine who the real antagonists and protagonists are.<br /><br />This is how it would be if heroes with superpowers actually did exist.<br /><br />Don't pass judgment until the book is finished.
B005SFR7YE|5.0|Spectacular production........Very touching and beautifully sang and acted.<br /><br />Loved the ending. That extra treat with previous \\"Phantoms\\" singing together magnificently. ..Just wonderful to see the original couple (Michael and Sarah) and so emotional.  I saw the very first production in London and thought that was great but this production is quite the most spectacular one.  Makes a great gift to a Webber fan......even to a non-Webber fan.................buy it.. it's worth every cent.
B0052U59F4|5.0|I have really enjoyed reading this book. I have gotten to know the characters and love them all. Sex scenes are pretty tactifully done. Was shocked about the subject matter but was not put off by it.I liked this book so much I am now almost finished Fifty Shades freed. I loved this whole triology
B005PK1G76|5.0|Love this thing.  I bought this to go with my Britax b-agile and it works perfectly!  The stroller folds up with this still attached with no problems.  Wondering if I buy another if I can somehow make it work with my Peg Perego double stroller now!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|I will keep it short and sweet. Read it! A new twist on an old tale. I know a book is great when I feel as though I know the characters personally in all their flawed glory and care about what happens to them. Make sure you have cleared your day when you start reading, b/c it will be hard to tear yourself away. I won't say much about the plot as not to ruin any part of the books. I will say that it is a page turner, and character development is fantastic. Hoping this series continues!
1594744769|5.0|I read the book in less than twenty-four hours. The cover is what immediately drew the book into my lap, the cover was fascinating, when I read the back flap it sounded interesting, I immediately bought it. I was cautious; I am extremely hesitant to buy anything slightly sci fi, fantasy or magic-y. I was pleasantly surprised when I could not set the book down. Each chapter became more and more intriguing and I realized I had a new favorite author to look out for. Cant wait for more novels!
B007AB5KF2|4.0|I have really enjoyed this series. It has been surprising and unexpected, not the usual teen fare. I would recommend this to anyone who likes vampires.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|My husband and I both read and enjoyed this book immensely. We whave recommended it to our friends. I'm looking forward to reading more books by William Landay.
B004UXUX7S|1.0|...for so many awards? I went to see it in the theater with two others. We were all expecting to see a good movie but were really disappointed. After about 1hr into the movie, I just wanted to slit my wrists because it really is a depressing movie. Boo.
0736092269|5.0|It doesn't matter if you're new to bodybuilding or if you have been doing it for years. This book covers everything. Every muscle is covered. How you train it, what the common injuries are and so on. It's a must-buy!
B006PZBR8S|5.0|Really liked this movie, action packed and kind of emotional. Good fights, gets your adrenalin going. Liked Hugh Jackman and the kid, Funny.....
B0050DZN4K|5.0|I like feedly as a great way to get a visual scan of my various feed. Nice customization settings and share features.
0439023491|4.0|The book is written for pre-teens - who are figuring out their world. So, I can say you would expect whiny, flip-flop and selfishness. This for me was not unrealistic stretch from reality. Of course, there is a love triangle. Can't you remember the one sitting in your face and the one you longed for? Not always the same person. Overall, an adult would find the book a slow read and not as explosive as Hunger Games. A young adult - teen reader it would be on point. I read it (over 35 y.o.) and my niece read it (15 y.o.) - we both really like the book. She thought is was exactly like trying to see which guy you want. And I enjoyed the reality of a teen girl just getting to know herself.  However, if you looking for the explosive - know what she has to do Katniss, this is not for you.  This Katniss is more like a true teenager - trying to be grown and still having a lot to learn. Even though she is still mature for such a young heroine.<br /><br />For those with teens that want to do something together - reading this trilogy is a great way for some shared time! It is great to open discussion about life, love, and culture influences.<br /><br />So, for time well spent learning my niece world and thoughts, I give it 4 stars. NOTE - she gave it 4.5 stars. She thought there were some slow parts as well.
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is the best electronic version of solitaire I have encountered. I especially like not having to drag the cards except when advantageous to do so.
0345803485|5.0|This series of books was the best I have read thus far. It draws you in with the characters, Christian and Ana, who are so richly developed and interesting. I couldn't put this book down and ordered the second and third books before I was half way through the 1st book. BEWARE you will stay up reading all night...no kidding I saw it happen to myself and then my mom who decided maybe she should check this out! She loved it as well and starting her second read through of the series the minute she finished the third book. It is great stuff!!
B0054JZC6E|4.0|its a fun app for when you are trying to kill time.  some of the games are lame but some are more fun
1451627289|5.0|Based on the negative reviews, I had originally decided NOT to read \\"11/22/63.\\" Then a couple weeks ago my cousin recommended it, and after talking to him, I decided to give the novel a shot. Wow! 850 pages! I had my doubts, but once I started I kept reading and finished it in about a week.<br /><br />Going back to the negative reviews after I finished the novel, I think they missed the big picture of a facinating trip back to the late 1950s and early 1960s. One critical comment was that King used \\"The past is oburate\\" too often. I didn't see it that way. It was something that needed to be emphasized.<br /><br />Also, I thought the love story was just fine. Some critics said it was sappy, but for me it was real. Could the novel have been edited? Yes, but overall, I didn't mind reading the parts the critics wanted removed. Maybe I was just ready for the novel.<br /><br />I learned at lot about Lee Harvey Oswald that I didn't know, or had forgotten. That he was a wife beater, for example.<br /><br />If you want to get lost in a thick novel and arn't too nitpicky, you'll love \\"11/22/63.\\"
B0073PZIBQ|4.0|I enjoyed this movie, all three of the leads are charming enough.  But certainly didn't live up to the talent involved either.  I don't regret the rental, it was fun.
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|I love this game.<br />the graphic are very well made. but the lives go by fast. I recommend to anyone though.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|it reminds me of Mario brothers which I think is why I like it so much. it's a fun game overall.
B004VMUS9G|5.0|love this alarm clock... if your like me and press snooze in your sleep this is perfect for you. you can set it to make you answer math questions before you hit snooze!!
0345803485|1.0|I was extremely disappointed by this book. So disappointed that I wished I could get my money back. To start off the writing style was worse than some of the more poorly written fanfictions I've read. Phrases are completely overused and half way through the book I want to shackle her \\"inner goddess\\" so she won't dance anymore, cut her bottom lip off so I won't have to hear about her biting it anymore, and drain her of her blood so she'll stop blushing. It may sound graphic but I was that annoyed. Normally I can look past this sort of thing in an erotic novel if the story is good enough. However, after the first couple of encounters this book was no longer sexy, but simply insulting. This book gives readers who may not have experience in the BDSM lifestyle a completely twisted point of view as to what the lifestyle is like. While Ana's reactions to the lifestyle do seem like some of the more negative reactions to the lifestyle, the book gives the impression that the only reason someone could possibly be interested in it is if they have some sort of traumatic past that drives the desire and I recommend that anyone who read this book without previous knowledge of the lifestyle to do their own research rather than taking their impressions from this book. In addition to being insulting the book felt completely unrelatable. Being around the same age as Ana with a boyfriend around the same age as Christian I had to suspend a lot of disbelief about their behavior, relationship, and how flat out rich Christian was. Except for a few witty moments this book was completely lacking and flat out insulting.<br />This book really only deserves half a star.<br />Laters baby
B0064T6LV8|5.0|its so fun. three different boards all fun. no Internet connection needed. a a a a a a a a a a
B005Q1W10A|1.0|I was very disappointed to find that nearly every dvd in season 1 & 2 skipped and wouldn't play right even after cleaning . I must have gotten a bad batch and the worst part is that I wasn't able to view them until after the return period lapsed due to a heavy work schedule. Because it was a series and the discs were new and sealed, I never dreamed that they would all skip. My player is fine and plays other discs with no problem so I'm inclined to think I may just have gotten a bad batch of dvd's! I hope that Amazon will replace them, otherwise that's $30 down the drain which will force me to never buy from Amazon again!
B004A8ZWVK|1.0|Never received the movie very disappointed in this company that I was to receive it from. I will spread thier name around so no one that I know ever orders from them.<br /><br />Linda Evers
0345803485|4.0|To begin, let me say I was really excited to read this book.  All of the hype and controversial reviews really piqued my curiousity, especially since I have never heard of an erotic book getting so much attention before.<br /><br />Others who have read this series really liked \\"Beautiful Disaster\\", so I read that first.  I Loved it and expected something similar to that story or at least something comparable.  That story was AMAZING, and its love story was Beautiful!<br /><br />While I was able to read this this without putting it down (why I gave it 4 stars instead of 3), it was because I was anxious and \\"angsty\\" to get to the story amidst all of the sex scenes.  I enjoy erotica and good sex scenes, but when the book has a higher percentage of sex versus plot, that is when I get disappointed.<br /><br />I did enjoy watching the growth of the characters and how their feelings developed, but I felt I had to rifle through sex scenes to get to the story.  The author really does know how to write some great sex scenes though!<br /><br />My favorite scenes were the email exchanges, and I thought the references to Tess of the d'Urbervilles were great!  Again, I am not opposed to reading sex scenes and actually really enjoy \\"some\\", but if I ever re-read this story, I would probably skim over a lot of scenes and just pay attention to their relationship outside of the bedroom.
B004LWZW8I|2.0|Let me start by saying the C.G.I. was great and the scenery they created was awesome, and the colors were outstanding. That being said the rest of the aspects of the movie were weak. The storyline was good, but presented poorly. The acting,except for Mickey Rourke as the evil king, was only passable. And come on!!!!!! Do we really need that much blood guts and gore to tell a story. I think Tarsem Singh did the movie a disservice by going over the top on the GORE. I would have rated the movie higher if the violence was left in with a lot less blood and guts.
B003XF1XOQ|1.0|*Spoilers*<br /><br />As so many others have said, the character development was seriously lacking. I finished this yesterday and I'm still wondering why Snow was so driven to be the bad guy. Was it power? Money? Hate against the districts? How is it this one character can constantly ruin people's lives for decades and the main characters never stop to ask, \\"why\\"? The fact that he's evil is obvious, but his motivations are not defined clearly. If I'm a target of so much hate, I'd certainly want to know why.<br /><br />Gale. Could his development get any worse as a main character?<br /><br />Prim. I didn't care when she died. That says everything right there. Katniss goes to the Hunger Games to save her sister but Prim isn't developed enough throughout 3 books that we even care that she dies?<br /><br />Finnick. He was the best of the support characters. His past and motivations were done very well. Then we're left with his death. That was a wasted opportunity.<br /><br />You get my point I'm sure. I didn't care that any of them died because the author never gave me a reason to care.<br /><br />Plot points. The attempt by Katniss to reach Snow is ridiculous. She finally makes a real decision for herself and that's it? Run through the capital, through all of the mine fields and such and somehow find a way to get close enough to the President to kill him? Yeah, good luck with that. What's even worse is that so many characters who should have known better and are more mature/experienced decision makers follow her willingly to their deaths.<br /><br />The relationship \\"choice\\" ended up being no choice at all. Katniss took what was left and there's no development.<br /><br />The whole ending leaves me empty, in fact. It's nothing to do with \\"war is bad\\" or ptsd or any of the messages. It's simply rushed. There's no real recovery of the people or country. The epilogue is nearly pointless in fact. Ok, they lived and had kids. Got it.<br /><br />I look back on the first twobooks and wonder if they weren't rated too highly. None of the characters from those books, with the exception of Rue, seems to matter at all as a person in the story. Others have plenty to offer, but I couldn't care a bit about them. Considering some of them were in all 3, how much does that say about the development throughout the trilogy?
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I'm 13 and I think this game is kool. Its just lik Mario. It would be better if it had more levels and was a little more challenging but its ok.
B0063IH60K|4.0|It's a pretty cool game, when bored this game will surely make time pass fast. Overall a decent card game.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This really is a great album.  They are an incredibly talented group. Also got a great deal.  Love the band!
B0063IH60K|5.0|about as fair as playing with an actual deck of cards. Really I need to write more words because of your minimum?
B007PTJOV0|5.0|a game good enough to be Mario!!! finally they made a game similar to Mario I would say everyone needs this app!!! :)
B005RUV6RO|1.0|To Whom It May Concern,<br /><br />The preview for season 2 of the Walking Dead was free. However it didn't have the option to down load to my computer. This is important because I have a dial up connection and can not view streaming video at the rate of speed they use today. Perhaps if you could allow a down load to your computer funtion I could puchase movies to view. Thanks and may God bless.<br /><br />sincerely,<br /><br />Joseph.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is really fun I triply have too say I was looking at the comments before I got it and everyone seemed to really like this game I have to say the same for me it triply resembles Mario :))
B007IXWL2C|5.0|I could not out these triologies down. They were so good. It was like being addicted to a drug. I highly recommend these books. Especially from a person who doesn't read often. I had first two books in less then these days!
B0063IH60K|5.0|Great game!  One that the entire family can play!  A good game to pass the time away when waiting or just for fun.
B0017SWPXY|4.0|I found this book to be very eye opening as to what dogs really think. It was very interesting and different I enjoyed reading from the perspective of a dog, it was a fresh take on the world. The only thing I wasn't that keen on was all the talk about race cars, I understand that's what the book was sort of about but I found that to slow down the pace a little bit. Highly recommended to friends and family though.
B007PTJOV0|4.0|I love it it's just like Mario bros.Very addicting and challenging.Sometimes the snails glitch up but other than that it is great.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|very similar to popular mario well worth playing just make sure you have time to get hooked on it! slightly hard to get use to moving around but you learn fast how
B004O3YGMC|5.0|I use this all the time to remote into my desktop. It works great. I've not had any problems using it.
B006ON41FC|4.0|At first you think this game is just for little kids. Then you can't stop playing it.  it's really hard to put it down.
078322740X|5.0|With a cast like those two don't expect anything but funny action. We enjoyed every minute of the movie.Itis a good bet you will ebjoy the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|WORKS BEAUTIFULLY!! JUST FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS FOR THE DEVICE. DOWNLOADS ARE QUICK AND TEXT IS SHARP. HARD TO SORT THROUGH TO FIND FREE OR 99CENT BOOKS.
B003O86FMW|5.0|I picked this book up after my daughter finished reading it.  I enjoyed the characters and the action that lasted from cover to cover.
B0073XORCY|5.0|Just received TAAB2 and I am giving it a third listen... yes; a 3rd... like \\"old times.\\" Well done, Ian et al.! There are very few artists whose new releases I care to listen to several times within the span of a couple of days, the way I used to with a new Tull release years ago-- mostly jazz now (Chielli Minucci... Pat Metheny...Acoustic Alchemy), but the TAAB2 composition is so nicely layered, and the production is so well executed and played by all that each listen reveals other nuances... just like old times. I do miss Martin's input, but Florian is certainly top knotch-- and he manages to match that original TAAB Les Paul standard sound quite nicely. Very well done, gentlemen! (I really could have done without the return to some of the smug, cynical \\"anti-religious\\" lyrics, though.) I have to try to get to Ashville or Durham for one of the shows in September-- and bring my 13-year-old daughter so she can see how it's done (sans sychronized dancing and lip sync). I sincerely hope you have a few more of these in you, Ian. Best wishes for much success!
B007PT3QOQ|5.0|Great. This is an awesome game. Great for killing time when you are sitting around. I highly recommend it. It is good for all ages.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is definitely one of my favorite authors. When I saw that this book came out I was so excited to read it. I honestly couldn't put this book down I would stay up until 2:30 in the morning reading this. It is a little sad, but very uplifting in the same way. If you are a fan of John Green I recommend you read this one!
B0063IH60K|5.0|This is a great game. I play it all of the time. Its very simple and easy to play. yeah
B006M7JCC2|5.0|This book is the most comprehensive expression of the love that each person receives from his Maker---eternally.  No need to be \\"battling windmills\\" --ever.  There a way to the peace that we all say we want.
B004T2QZL8|5.0|I am having a fun time with this game. I can't wait to see what I'll make next.<br />The force close everyone is talking about hasn't happened.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|This was a wonderful surprise!!!  I love finding new up to date music, movies, and books for inexpensive prices.  Lady Antebellum's new CD has beautiful music on it and the MP3 format was so easy to download.
0439023521|4.0|Collins introduces us into a dystopian world in which Panem, the predominant nation in North America, holds annual, brutal, bloodbaths called \\"Hunger Games\\" in order to suppress and subdue the citizenry. We see the world through the eyes of Katniss Everdeen, a tough as nails teenage girl bent on taking care of her mom and little sister by whatever means necessary. Brazenly, Katniss takes the place of her younger sister when Primrose is chosen to be a contestant in the Hunger Games. Collins then adeptly builds suspense to the breaking point at which time hell is let loose in an arena in which children and teenagers fight to the death.<br /><br />The Cons:<br />1) Collins spends a substantial length of her book describing what each contestant is or will be wearing in the Hunger Games procession. My wife enjoyed the focus on clothing and fashion. I could have done without knowing the details of what each contestant would be wearing.<br />2) The trilogy didn't end with this book. The next two novels aren't as thought out, developed, or unique.<br />3) We don't learn a lot about the other districts in Panem. If Collins had spent the time she did on everyone's wardrobes leading up to the Games on getting to know the terrain, culture, and people in the other districts I feel we would have had a much better idea of and appreciation for her world building.<br /><br />The Pros:<br />1) Character development is solid and perfectly paced<br />2) The story is suspenseful, dramatic, and adequate...no big holes or let downs in the plot itself.<br />3) Though we see the world through the eyes of Katniss, she doesn't necessarily pick up on all the things we, as readers, are able to deduce. Collins did a great thing in writing the narrative from the perspective of a teenage girl, and to the author's credit, she realistically portrays that world view. Katniss doesn't know everything, particularly when it comes to reading people and their intentions. For example, she struggles with knowing the intentions of her male friends while the readers are able to see between the lines and deduce for themselves what Katniss misses because of personality defects.<br /><br />In all \\"The Hunger Games,\\" is a very well written novel that will sufficiently pull you into a post apocalyptic and chilling world that is a reminder to us all what could happen should freedom become second to the alluring safety and strength brought by dictatorship.wing the intentions of her male friends while the readers are able to see between the lines and deduce for themselves what Katniss misses because of personality defects.<br /><br />In all \\"The Hunger Games,\\" is a very well written novel that will sufficiently pull you into a post apocalyptic and chilling world that is a reminder to us all what could happen should freedom become second to the alluring safety and strength brought by dictatorship.
B003VIWO8Y|4.0|i realize i am echoing other reviewers, but this book is a good read.  I used to listen to metal in the 80's but was not a megadeth fan.  found the book for free (kindle) so took it on.  Wow.  flowed well, interesting, lot's of action.  It was fun!  Now Dave comes across as a good guy with many problems.  Really is sad that the rock sceen has a common theme.  \\"we were young, we were poor and near homeless, we became addicts, and when fame hit, we blew it, hurt everyone around us, and ended with our death, the death of loved ones, or we got sober and said 'what was that all about.' \\"  I guess a person would not do rock and roll if they were not an addict or very odd.  Dave does sound like a self centered individual (eg. \\"i can't believe my wife got a restraining order against me!\\")  I hear you have to do or say dangerous things so his threat to kill himself is not likely the only reason she got the order.  He did seem to develop nicely at the end so way to go Dave.

B0061QD82E|5.0|Too Beautiful to be real. The Restoration is amazing. however the special features are sensible but less than generous, most of it is from the 2006 DVD version. Worth buying defiantly, but Disney Home entertainment, if your watching this: Just because a Disney movie is a little old, doesn't mean you have to reuse everything from the past DVD special features. I'll expect more on the Cinderella blu ray comming out this fall, make a new \\"making of\\" feature this time. Is that too much to ask?
0062119044|5.0|I received this book in perfect condition and within just a couple days of ordering it.  I was very happy with this purchase.  The book is excellent and a great conversation starter or book for a book club
B0049GYXDG|5.0|This movie has the best restoration of any other Disney Movie yet. It makes the movie 10X better than it already is. For me personally, the restoration make The Lion King 3D look Like nothing. A treasure to my Disney Collection
030746363X|5.0|My husband brought home this book from a college bookstore one cold spring day. I was two months into my weight loss regime and very frustrated. I reluctantly began reading and after a weekend of following Tim Ferriss' workouts  and eating more than I ever have..I woke up to a loss of two pounds! and a flatter tummy. I'm now combing the book page by page and jotting down notes. Also my husband and daughter have come on board with a den full of kettlebells and a fridge full of lentils! Thank you for a fun and informative read!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|seems ok I guess it kinds did copy stupid Mario but ehh they couldn't come up with there own ideas I mean ehhh I do it on tests at school all the time so I guess it don't matter Lol.
B0067Q42BY|5.0|Got as a free app of the day, but I would definitely pay for this one. Good graphics and play.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this so much like Mario and I love Mario so much and this is so awesome and beast but how many leavles are there
B006ZZC3D6|4.0|This app is cute. You fling fluff balls around a board trying to solve a puzzle. Some are easy but some levels are not.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this game is cool I liken the game. it is just like the old. the Mario games it is a good game amazing really like it
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This app is the nature version of Mario Super Bros. Fun to play, a good time waster. Some levels are harder to pass though.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This game is just like Mario. Its kinds like a Irish Mario. If the NER brothers make another game like this with another person to be Luigi then that will be da bomb!
B0052UZIFA|3.0|Good game but it crashes every minute or so at random times on my transformer prime. May be because there is no support for ice cream sandwich.
B004MC8CA2|4.0|This is a great Bible app. I love the reading plans and the live interaction. The only reason I did not give five stars is because it shuts down a lot. But despite that I HIGHLY recommend this app. It is wonderful!
B006ZCWU5K|4.0|I like this album better than the last two. While they had some good songs, this one is easy to listen to from start to finish. This review is not long because it doesn't have to be. The Boss and the E Street boys are back.
B005IF5H2S|5.0|Love this group!  Great album.  Downloading from Amazon was easy and it integrated easily with iTunes.  You won't be disappointed with this album.  Buy it!
B0076NAWWA|4.0|First I am a Steve Morse fan, he is a great guitar player. He saved Deep Purple when Blackmore left. I'm really not that familiar with the other players in this band, but they are good. This music is so easy to listen to. It is rock, jazzy, bluesy, and tight. Since the players are from other bands, we don't know when there will be another album from these guys. Buy it, play it, and enjoy it.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|A real page turner!  Science fiction says so much about our present society and how easily freedom can be lost.  Hunger Games was well-written and engaged me immensely.  A book I did not want to put down.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|This was one of the best books I ever read. Its action packed and has a good plot. If you like adventure, I would recommend this book...
B004N70MH2|5.0|I read this book once and lent it to someone. I didn't get it back so I had to order another. The compelling true life story is just amazing. It is just not about Marcus Lutrell but also Murphy, Dietz and Axle. Real human beings that gave their lives for us and ultimately each other. Also the men that attemted to rescue them need to be recognized. Do yourself a favor and read the book then look into each and every person involved in this mission. See the human side of war. Please read.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|This is a good game for passing time, it is very similar to Mario on the dsi and on the wii. The only concern I have is it says Ner everwhere and I have no idea what it means or what is pointing to! Besides that, great game!
B006PHD0RW|4.0|Great game, interesting features overall, but needs more bacon. Who doesn't like bacon...anyway, if you ever wanted training on that bag boy job, her ya go!  Kidding, its actually a fun game.
0307956350|5.0|I'll be honest, I didn't know what to expect from this book.  It didn't take long, though, until I realized I had an awesome spy novel in my hands, that I couldn't put down.  This book, The Expats: A Novel, takes you all over the world, from North American, to South America, and to Europe.  There is murder, lust, and love interwoven with the author's great story-telling skills.  The only complaint I had about the book, was that the ending moved too quickly in comparison to the rest of the book.  A lot of time was compressed into a few pages.  Overall, I really recommend this book.
1451627289|4.0|What would YOU do if you discovered a time portal that takes you back to the 9th of September 1958?<br />Perhaps a phone call to the Breevort building in New York in mid January 1959 to warn Buddy Holly not to take the plane as he leaves for that fateful last tour; a visit to the Bath Hippodrome on the evening of April 16th 1960, to let Eddie Cochran know he should tell his driver to take it easy on the accelerator : and for your good deeds you could always reward yourself with massive bets on Don `Geronimo' Jordon stripping Virgil Akins for the World Welterweight title on the 5th of December '58, then wait for the following year when Nottingham Forest beat Luton Town 2 -1 in the F.A up final - or for Oxo to win the Grand National at Aintree.<br />Jake Epping - the hero of Stephen King's latest epic has somewhat loftier intentions - live in the past for five years and wait for Friday 22nd of November 1963 to prevent the Kennedy assassination - an event thought by many to have robbed America of its innocence and helped usher in that massive PR disaster known as Vietnam and ultimately the decline of the American empire.<br />The multiple shooter/grassy knoll version has become so accepted that the possibility of a lone assassin has been virtually dismissed, but after nearly fifty years of investigation, speculation and conspiracy theories on the most public murder in history (of the world's most powerful man in front of thousands of witnesses and cameras) the 20th century's greatest crime remains a mystery.<br />So now popular belief has drifted back to the lone shooter theory and Lee Harvey Oswald once again takes centre stage in this uniquely American shadow play. With this in mind Jake first has to ascertain that Oswald really was the killer - and that he was/will be working alone.<br />King wastes little time in explaining how or why a time-tunnel discovered in the back room of a road-side diner exists and pretty much gets straight to the action. The concept is brilliantly worked out - in short, when you return from the past after changing events your arrival back is always two minutes after you left, but you will have aged by however long you spent in the past. And if you re-enter the porthole history reverts back to its original state and whatever changes you made have to be made again. Also, `the past is obdurate' and doesn't like to be changed so obstacles galore will stack up against you. But also `the past harmonises' and if you look for it fate will help you. Get it? Don't worry - just read it - it will all become clear (ish). A couple of dummy runs where Jake has to start his quest all over again are a frustrating illustration of just how delicate a matter changing the future can be.<br />Once again King's forte as a creator of page turners is in evidence and I almost didn't want this book to end. The attention to detail - the amplified taste of additive-free food, the constant odour of oil refinery's polluting Texan air, the convoluted styling of automobiles, attitudes to race, sex and religion - all transport the reader as seamlessly as this story's fissure in time as Jake lives his life in early 60's America and awaits his date with destiny. I could have quite happily followed Jake Epping all the way back to the future. King's treatment of what is essentially a fantastical tale is treated in such an offhand manner that the SF element is all but forgotten and that you have to remind yourself that the book is fiction.<br />11.22.63 will have you drawing your own conclusions about what might have been if Kennedy survived: a happier, warless world? My guess is a that a series of Hoover leaked Clinton/Lewinski-esque sex scandals may have toppled Camelot - the rubble on which LBJ would still have stood and led the charge into Saigon.<br />And Buddy and Eddie? Maybe Holly would have gone on to have his dreamed of collaboration with Ray Charles and perhaps discovered and signed a young Bob Dylan to his new label whilst ona night out with his young wife in nearby Bleeker Street. Eddie would have got his close friend Gene Vincent into rehab, became an important producer and even made some respectable appearances as an actor in many late 60's counter culture movies. But history has shown, almost without exception, that pop stars create their best work early on in their careers and either fade away and/or become parodies of themselves. The same could be said for a lot of writers, but for many 11.22.63 will be considered among Stephen King's best.a night out with his young wife in nearby Bleeker Street.

B006OGMEUI|5.0|This album is loud as Irish folk music is loud, don`t know anything else about which to compare it to actually.  Not the same way that Agolloch's Marrow of the Spirit is loud in the first half.  I'm not sure if it's as Metal as Everything Remains as it Never Was.  Peculiarly, it sounds like a cross of that and Evocation 1.  Plenty of female vocals, mostly in the form of Not so Primal Screams.  Is it my imagination or does this band's lineup keep getting longer?  I would like to say that the songs are distinguishable.  Unfortunately the majority of the louder ones seem to merge together, in a long ever changing melody, all seeming to have a similar theme.  Prog: yes, no?  Folk?  Only in a pop format, in my opinion.  Lot's of folksy solos... sticking to their, um Swiss, heritage I suppose?  They'd have us believe that they abhor and regret the Roman occupation of the majority of the western world.  This is long past and far gone, minus the catholic church.  I can't see how someone can still lament such a thing.  Should the religious right then be expected to make reparations to pagan peoples across the globe, for their crushing trouncing of what was western `culture' of the time.  These albums always make me wonder that, as an objective bystander.  Who is really so right?  So, what does it come down to; in my opinion again?  Excellent album.  Diverges from their previous ones and improves on what was, as it will never remain the same, once again.
B000001E77|5.0|Worth the rating for this one track (PAPA DON'T TAKE NO MESS)  the long version.  The rest of the songs are average at best.
B000J3Q8U4|1.0|Ordered this video to watch on my laptop. Received the disk very quickly and well packaged. Disk did not play on my drive. Returned disk and received replacement. This disk did not work either. Changed region of DVD player on Laptop, no luck. Packaging did not state compatability of DVD. Had to file disk in my round filing cabinet. I give up.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|love it and keeps me entertained. Reminds me of super Mario brothers though. very time consuming. good for when your bored.
B006LS7DQE|4.0|Very fun game, works well and looks great on the Kindle Fire. Very addictive and time consuming, beware! It is fun to grind and save up for powerful items to customize your character. You will need to do this to beat some of the harder battles later in the game. Good Luck. Booyah!

Where´s BEHIND THE SUN or FIGHT LIKE A BRAVE????Well, this is only a decent way to understand what this great band is all about...try their best albuns MOTHER´S MILK, BLOOD SUGAR SEX MAGIC, ONE HOT MINUTE and CALIFORNICATION...
0345803485|5.0|I heard about this book on \\"Today Show\\" and said ok I've got to read this and believe me I'm not a big reader and I had it read in no time.  I got in to it then said no its not for me then I figured I'll give it a few more pages and \\"OH MY GOSH\\" I loved it and more I enjoyed it.  I read some other reviews and those who think it was bad...your so wrong and I'm sorry for those who can't feel those feelings because they really are there with in all of us, don't be afraid of them, they do put a smile on your face.  I really would like to have it ended different but and hope there is a second book but for now I can't keep my mind off what is next and with a big smile.  Thank you for your great book.  Oh ya I'm passing this book around and the word to my friends and everyone that has read my book has signed it.  Now I'm wanting you to sign too. Enjoy everyone I did...

B0072X2NUS|4.0|I've been a fan of Depeche Mode, Yaz, & Erasure for decades & was really excited about this album.  I really like most of the tracks (can imagine their mixes being played at the clubs), but I really do wish that at least a few of the songs had lyrics cause I love to hear Martin sing.  Overall, a really good album if you are into instrumentals.

B004W2UBYW|5.0|I am only half way through, but I am so glad to be reading this. Sometimes we forget that the people who eventually change our world/lives are not always perceived as nice, caring, polite, fair or loyal persons. They are sometimes off in left field, dreaming their own dreams and achieving them at all costs. That's what this book is depicting. We may think of him as a great man for what he brought us, and is still bringing us, but in reality, he was ruthless to a fault. I am still enjoying this book and believe everyone should read it. It is long, but full of life. I think the author did a good job bringing to light his real life...good or bad.  Judy P
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game, it's good for me because I love to travel. you should also buy if you love to travel. also if you like helping people even if they're not real

B004ZISVWC|5.0|I had never even heard of this movie, and from the name was thinking that it would be corny.  To my surprise it was a well-acted film in the style of the Blair Witch Project -- kudos especially to the lead character.<br /><br />I'm telling my friends about this one.  And by the way, if you have Amazon Prime, you can watch it for free.
B0076I8O70|5.0|The original lineip of It Bites...Francis Dunnery (guitars, vocals), John Beck (keyboards, backing & harmony vocals) Dick Nolan (bass, backing vocals) and Bob Dalton (drums, backing vocals) produced three solid, hook-filled, tuneful, guitar-crunchy prog rock albums between 1986 and 1989: [[ASIN:B000024XCW The Big Lad in the Windmill]], [[ASIN:B00009P8NU Once Around the World]], and [[ASIN:B00008LLC4 Eat Me in St. Louis]]. Frontman Francis Dunnery had a voice not unlike Genesis-era Peter Gabriel, although the band was certainly not a Genesis clone. They rocked a little harder, had a little more attitude, and were not as rigidly tied to old-school prog as some of their contemporaries. They were a rock band with prog overtones, and they rocked indeed.<br /><br />Dunnery left in 1990 to pursue a solo career. The remaining members shifted around a bit, sometimes under the It Bites banner, other times with a new name (such as the pairing of Beck and Daltion with John Mitchell (from Arena and Frost*, lead vocals and guitars) and Pete Trewavas (from Marillion, bass) as \\"Kino.\\" The lineup released the well-received [[ASIN:B00079RNKE Picture]] in 2005.<br /><br />In 2006, the nucleus of Beck, Dalton and Mitchell became the new It Bites and in 2008 released the critically acclaimed [[ASIN:B001F0PR52 Tall Ships]]. The band hadn't successfully \\"replaced\\" Dunnery...those were some big and distinctive shoes to fill...as much as found a way to carry on in the spirit of the band's original vibe.<br /><br />Fast-forward to the present...2012...and the new album, \\"Map of the Past.\\" Founding member Dick Nolan is gone, replaced by Lee Pomeroy. Other than that, the momentum established by Dalton, Mitchell and Beck on \\"The Tall Ships\\" continues with what many consider to be a superior follow-up to an already classic first post-Dunnery effort.<br /><br />It's unfortunate that in the United States, this album has flown completely under the radar. As you can see from this review, it's available here only as an import, and it's received virtually no fanfare. But if you venture \\"across the pond\\" to the Amazon U.K. Website, you'll see a large group of enthusiastic reviewers who have awarded this four and five stars.<br /><br />11 songs, 52 minutes, and in the tradition of classic It Bites, most tracks clock in at 4 minutes while two of them stretch out to 6.<br /><br />Like many bands who arrived in the second wave of prog following Yes, Genesis, Kin Crimson et. al., you could spend all day listening to these tracks while playing \\"spot the influence.\\" The opener, \\"Man In The Photograph,\\" is a slowly-building, keyboard-driven ballad in the Procol Harum mold. That segues into the guitar-driven, riff-happy stomper \\"Wallflower,\\" which really harkens back to the Dunnery era (as well as Mitchell's work in Frost*). \\"Cartoon Graveyard\\" is another track that leans heavily on the classic It Bites sound. \\"Meadow and the Stream\\" has \\"big prog epic\\" written all over it, reminiscent of the title track to the Frost* album [[ASIN:B000G04UYG Milliontown]] while throwing in several heaping measures of \\"Lamb\\"-era Genesis. \\"The Last Escape\\" is a nice moody, tuneful, atmospheric track with tasty guitar solos, and it feels like a suitable closer for the album...although that distinction goes to \\"Exit Song, clocking in at a minute and a half, performed by Mitchell on acoustic guitar.<br /><br />I have mixed feelings about the band if I listen to the new material and follow it with a listent to any of the Dunnery tracks. As an example, in my copy of iTunes, \\"Map of the Past\\" is immediately followed by the blast of \\"Once Around The World\\" and the signature Dunnery tune, \\"Midnight.\\" It's in that moment that I realize comparisons to the old and new are futile here...Mitchell's not Dunnery, nor should he attempt to be...so in the same way that it's possible to enjoy [[ASIN:B000002J1M Foxtrot]] and [[ASIN:B000002J2B Wind & Wuthering]] as two fine efforts by different editions of thesame band, \\"Map of the Past\\" should also be enjoyed.<br /><br />A nice visit from old friends whose musical future remains bright.
B001NBEWN6|2.0|Such a drag. really, I like poetry, but there were pages and pages and pages of descriptions. Also, how do you make incest boring?? Well, this author managed it. I would have loved this book as a moody teenager. Not so much now.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|its awesome hes just like Mario I wish they had Mario on the kindle for free hes awesome I love it
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Don't stop at just book one.  You must read all three!  I thought the story line was very good with a few twists and turns.  While not a page turner for me, I was always anticipating picking the books back up.  I think a must read for all three of the books.
B00785P2QC|5.0|I love it. it seems as if I really am trying to create a city.but without working. again I love it and will continue to play it
B0034G4P26|5.0|After years of disappointment the Pirate Captain (Hugh Grant) resolves to finally win the Pirate of the Year competition and so embarks on a series of raids on passing ships in the hope of earning sufficient booty to compete with the his rivals Cutlass Liz (Salma Hayek) and Black Belamy (Jeremy Piven). However he is still plagued by bad luck with the best produced by a succession of raids being the capture of Charles Darwin (David Tennant). Still at least Darwin is able to identify that Pirate Captain's beloved parrot Polly is in fact a dodo, supposedly extinct for over a hundred years. This gives them both an idea...!<br /><br />Pirates! is a gloriously hilarious, exquisitely produced movie. Its very much a children's movie but with plenty of sly asides to keep adults on their toes as well. The sets are stupendous and almost beg a second viewing in themselves to allow the viewer to try to aborb all the teeming detail. Both the voice performances of the cast, and the painstaking detail of the stop-motion animation are flawless.<br /><br />I thought it as close to perfect a piece of film-making as I have seen in many years and I hope for more adventures of the Pirate Captain and his crew in the not to distant future.
0446343129|5.0|I first read this book back in the late 70's when I was just 19 and it rocked my world! But, like any addict, I have battled my addiction to sugar for the past 30 years, unable to go even a year completely sugar free (and lets be clear, I am talking about refined sugar and food products with high fructose corn syrup added to them). But recently I was introduced to Dr. Robert Lustig and his youtube video in which he speaks eloquently and authoritatively on the \\"evils\\" of sugar consumption and the toxic poison that it is. Watching his video (and his recent appearance on 60 minutes) was all I needed to realize that it was time for a change and that change was to give up sugar for good. Watching Dr. Lustig speak about the toxicity of sugar also cast my mind back to this ground-breaking book, which I promptly re-read and enjoyed very much, especially the history of the sugar trade and it's parallels to the drug trade. For those of you needing yet another<br />slap in the face to wake you up from your sugar addiction and the horrendous effects it is having on your body and mind, just read this book (and watch Dr.<br />Lustig's youtube video!!). You won't be able to live in denial any longer. By the way, I'm currently 90 days sugar free and feeling better than I ever have.
B007PTJOV0|1.0|Any of you people who like this game are insane. its a crappy spinoff of Mario in which a bug is a goomba a snail is a turtle and a bug is a pihrana plant. no enjoyment at all ....only good part is that you can walk backwards... but that's not even very fun! you cant even replay a level!!!!!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|This is a fun story. The only problem I had with it... it consumed me and I couldn't sleep until I read it all! I even had a dream about it. I would recommend it to anyone looking for a fun read.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I wanted to know what all the hype was, so I got the Hunger games on my kindle. I couldn't put it down, I wanted to see how it ended. I guess it was a good story, but the best I can say is to get out the prozac. So very depressing. All of the pain and sorrow. All of the young lives lost, for nothing more than entertaiment. What I didn't get was the total complience of everyone involved.\\" Oh, ok, so I have to go kill people.\\" I hate to think that this a is something that people think may happen to us soon. I hope that the younger children don't get the chance to see the movies, or to read the books. Nightmare makers for sure.

B004HO6HWA|1.0|- SPOILER AHEAD!<br /><br />- There are so many big logical holes that they ruin my interest. For example, Arthur Bishop (Jason Statham) was able to train an alcoholic into an efficient killer. Yeah right!<br /><br />- The acting is not convincing at all. Especially Ben Foster does not act like a professional killer at all.<br /><br />- The plot is absolutely predictable.<br /><br />- There is neither any emotional nor interesting scene.<br /><br />- No wonder it flopped at the box office. According to rottentomatoes.com, domestically it made only 29.1 millions of dollars
B001HN6922|5.0|Purchased for my nephew who absolutely loved the movie, can't wait to see it myself.  Was extremely happy with how quickly it shipped!
0345803485|4.0|I read this book over the weekend....pretty hot stuff!! Be warned, Adults Only. There were quite a few steamy scenes not to mention twisted and explicit content (definitely needs a warning label!!)  I had heard this book started out as twilight fan fiction. There were some vague similarities to Edward and Bella (such as her clumsiness and relationship with her parents, his breathtaking beauty and warnings to stay away and of course their inexplicable attraction to each other!!) However, overall I found Ana Steele and Christian Grey to remind me of Vivian Ward and Edward Lewis from Pretty Woman. There were similarities throughout the book... from his successful career path, extravagant shopping/gifts, hotel suite (the penthouse, of course), piano playing, opera music, relationship parameters and issues to her quick wit, smart mouth, romantic vision of wanting \\"more\\" and not wanting to be just a \\"kept woman\\". There's even a scene in which she keeps responding to his emails and he scolds her to stop, which reminds me of when Vivian kept answering his phone calls after being told not to and she responds \\"then stop calling me!\\" The book also could have been edited better with it's grammatical errors and the annoying redundant conversations of Ana with her \\"inner goddess\\" and subconscious alter ego persona. The ending was very rushed and overall the book seemed unpolished, seemed like maybe they rushed it into print. I realize it's the authors first book...but the publisher could have done a better job with the details. For these reasons I ended up giving a 4 out of 5 rating. I am looking forward to the sequels and seeing how the story ends up...as I have them on preorder here with Amazon and can't wait for next week!! Wish they had released them all together as a set.

0446547654|4.0|Nicholas Sparks scores again with a winner about the reuniting of high school sweethearts twenty years after they were torn apart because the girls mom didn't approve of the boy. This one, like a lot of his books scores with simple realism and snappy plot moves that work splendid. It's not as predictable as I thought some of his novels were becoming. I'm a fan of Sparks and I'm starting to think he can do no wrong. Smart writing!
0446547654|2.0|the book was hard for me to relate to...<br />i was hoping to read something like the notebook or message in a bottle, but was nothing like that<br />i hated most of the characters. i only liked dawson.<br />amanda is set to be unbearable. and her relationship with her mother, at 42 ... just ... ¿?<br /><br />too many characters, too many plots, most of them not that interesting...<br /><br />as for the love story... i actually got engaged at some point and loved it... but then it became so dull, so predictable, it was as cheesy as it gets. i hated the end. totally. somehow it became about some other thing that the loves tory...

1400032717|1.0|I read this book because Amazon recommended it since I was a big fan of \\"The Brief, Wondrous Life of Oscar Wao.\\" This book is nothing like Oscar Wao. The writing is so simplistic it drove me crazy. I understand it was written from the perspective of someone with Aspberger's, but it was frustrating nonetheless. I just don't feel like there was any real point to this story. I didn't walk away with any new insights or relevant thoughts. It was a really easy read, but overall, a waste of my time.
B006FTC6ZC|5.0|This is an enjoyable black comedy, with plenty of twist. At first glance, with the title, you may think its going to be like evil dead, or evil dead 2. No, its not, so don't make the same mistake I did. But go ahead and watch it with an open mind. Because it is funny, it is scary.. and has some very tense moments.<br /><br />And while some cliche things happened in the movie, enough twist happened, that it keeps you on your toes and wondering whats going to happen next?<br /><br />I rated it 5 star because of the ending. With the way things were going it actually surprised me.<br /><br />I want give another plot synopsis like everyone else, but the two main characters, are indeed just that.. Characters. Funny and heartwarming individuals at times.
0307946711|3.0|This is a love story that examines the relationship of two lovers over a lifetime. At times the characters are frustrating, and other times, endearing and easy to relate to. The writing is superb and the plot is engaging. Once I started reading, I couldn't put it down.<br /><br />It's not a novel I'd read again, and I felt like it dragged on a bit towards the middle/end. But overall, this is the perfect summer beach read- does not require a lot of thinking, and really draws you in.
B005XI94HY|5.0|One of the most beautiful and haunting albums I've ever listened to. The production is amazing, her voice gives you goosebumps. I can't stop listening to it.
B004XJRQUQ|3.0|I've read these books because I wanted to read them before I saw the movie. The first book of the trilogy is my favourite. The other two, not so much. They are the natural continuance of the first one, but they are very political for my taste. The love triangle and relationships between Katniss, Peeta and Gale are way too complicated for adolescents. By the end of the trilogy, they are too psychologically damaged to feel like functional human beings and to allow us readers to relate to them.<br />On the other hand, the possibility to purchase all three books at once is very comfortable for Kindle owners. I hope you guys at Amazon come up with more books series to buy all-at-once.
B005NS5CX4|5.0|I was able to get a great deal through a local radio station and purchased the Lady Antebellum album here on Amazon for 25 cents. It is a great album and all the songs are terrific. I am very satisfied with my purchase and with the music I got for an outstanding deal..

B0050DIWFC|3.0|If I divided this book in half and was able to rate each half, I'd give the first half a one star and the second half five stars. Even though the writing was simply written, it still held my interest enough for me to plod on. By the time I got to the 50% mark I couldn't put it down. The ending was a bit weird and I didn't see it coming. My friend, who also read it, said I have to be the only one who was clueless. Looking back on it, I probably wouldn't run right out to buy it again but I'm not sorry I read it.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|Okay then. The books were INCREDIBLE I read the first one before I realized that it was a series-then th next day I borrowed my friends kindle and read the rest. I loved them sooo much!!! As a matter of fact, I read them amid the Harry Potter books. For the people who compared the two series--please, just SHUT UP!! You cant compare ice cream to steak, ya know? They are too different: different types of characters, different moral problems, different settings(one is futuristic one is magical), and most importantly, different authors. You cant expect different authors to write he same. Okay, while I agreed that the third book should have had alittle more character development, and that I would have liked to see Peetas perspective in the government, I still loved the characters and felt really kindred to them. To some of Katniss's problem, I could indeed relate. Thanks Suzanne Collins, for a great series!! &#60;3
0307956350|5.0|This is a great debut novel. It really appealed to me. I loved the setting in Europe with much of it taking place in Paris, my favorite city.  There didn't appear to be any inaccuracies in his descriptions so I'm guessing the author spent a decent amount of time in the countries mentioned. The book got off to somewhat of a slow start but by the time I was about 15% into it, I was hooked.  There were spots where the details were superfluous but it didn't take away from the story at all.  I wouldn't advise this book for anyone who is a slow reader since the logistics can get confusing and it needs to be read more than a few pages at a time.<br /><br />I didn't expect the ending and it was good up until the very last page. I'll be looking forward to Pavone's next novel.<br /><br />I tried to post a review of this last night but it didn't go through so I hope this isn't a duplicate
B006OAB3ME|2.0|It all sounds the same!!  Macca singing in an eerie head voice/chest voice gets tiresome very quickly.  The Voice in all it's colors is only heard on \\"Only Our Hearts\\"--which currently to my ears may have been written and arranged an hour before the recording session.<br /><br />Diana Krall's arrangements and direction doesn't allow Singer, band, or song to \\"breathe and soar.\\"  Furthermore, the performances are much too restrained--sounding \\"buttoned up and sentimental,\\" miles away from the rollicking emotional/musical shifts of Beatle pastiche tunes like \\"Martha My Dear\\" or \\"When I'm Sixty-Four.\\"  The string arrangements were obviously edited by everybody but the arranger himself, producing clouds of hotel-elevator harmony that occasionally waft in and out but usually without any explanation.<br /><br />Paul's voice sounded aged and heavy on \\"My Valentine,\\"  which I think may be his last masterpiece.  It might take, however, somebody else with a little more vocal freshness and feeling to elevate this song to \\"standard\\" level.  (No, not you Mr. Levine! I was thinking more of a Feinstein or Buble...;) )<br /><br />The cover tunes on the album are derivative of other turn of the century/depression era tunes, but great arrangements and performances would have improved them significantly along the lines of Sinatra's \\"Songs for Swinging Lovers,\\" Ronstadt's \\"What's New\\" or \\"A Little Touch of Schmilsson in the Night.\\"  On the other hand, I actually do like some of these more obsure tunes, esp. \\"We Three\\", \\"More I Cannot Wish You\\" (which the lyrics were slightly yet badly altered from the original), \\"Inchworm\\" (a somewhat odd rendering of it!) and \\"Home (When Shadows Fall).\\"<br /><br />All in all a big disappointment.  I gave it two and a half for the attempt and song selection.
0439023521|4.0|Not bad but definitely over-hyped?  Fun read at any age, but  not anxious to get the next book in the series.
B007Q476KU|2.0|If you are not one of the above listed on the review title, you might want to pass this one by.<br />Good for some folks - boring mush for others.
B005HJWWW8|5.0|Just received this AMP today and did an intense listening session (about 2 hours) of listening to different genres and artists and comparing all the different EQ settings and plugging the headphones into the standard jack on the top of the iPod. The difference is very noticeable. I have concluded that EQ3 is my preferred setting. It creates a better sound-stage and the overall presentation of the music is considerably warmer. EQ2 is good if you like more punch in your bass. EQ1 was actually unbearable to listen to. I'm not sure what that would be used for. With no EQ selected the unit is simply boosting the signal from the LOD. The following link is to the product I use to connect my E6 to my iPod. [[ASIN:B004QVNNI0 FiiO L9 L-Shaped Line Out Dock (LOD) Cable For iPod and iPhone]]<br /><br />Overall this AMP was worth the price and I would recommend it to anyone looking to enhance their headphone listening experience.<br /><br />Also, these are the headphones I am listening with [[ASIN:B004ZG9TMA Audio-Technica ATHM50S Professional Monitor Headphones]]
B004LOMB2Q|4.0|I was working on a school project it was great for me to organize my work. great app overall for everyone
B007MNV5WU|1.0|they only give you two worlds with none of the extras that people with apple products get! how messed up is that? I want my $$$ back! This game was supposed to be amazing!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|this is a really cool game. reminds me of super Mario on the original nintrndo. I would love to see one for each holiday.... turkey, Santa,  Easter bunny,... my 6 yr Olds enjoy it as much as I do. awesome job creators!!!
B007PTJOV0|5.0|totally love it. feel like a kid again. reminds me of Mario. my kids are mad because I won't give them a turn.
B007MNV5WU|5.0|the best game I have ever played in my entire life and also the best game in the entire world!!!!!!!
B004RKXNDU|5.0|Oustanding. LeCarre's abilty to extract emotions from his readers is only equalled by his superlative character representation. The reader is handed a first class ticket to not only LeCarre's brilliant imagination, but deep into his storytelling soul as well.
B0050DIWFC|5.0|This book was a page turner from beginning to end.  One of the best reads I have had in a long time. A book that you cannot put down. I absolutely loved how the author developed the story. A book that cannot be missed!
B000FC1HBY|5.0|if you enjoyed the first in this series you won't be disappointed in the second book.  If anything you care even more for your favorite charactors.  enjoy it.
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Let me start out by saying that I gave Book One a 4-star rating. With the exception of a few minor annoyances I really enjoyed that book, and so was looking forward to continuing Christian and Ana's saga in this one. Oh man I should have just called it good. I'm not even sure where to start without going on a tirade.<br /><br />Talk about a co-dependent relationship. She thinks she's unworthy of him, doesn't trust him, and constantly does the \\"why me\\" whine. He thinks he's unworthy, doesn't trust her, and continually stalks her at every turn. They both need serious therapy. There is absolutely nothing sexy or loving with this couple.<br /><br />The sex is continual and let's face it, quite boring. The author repeats herself continually - from comments, to descriptors, to blah blah blah there is just nothing exciting here.<br />I could easily go on and on but as I said, I don't want this to become a tirade, and frankly this book isn't worth my time.<br /><br />Save your money folks and find something else.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Great app. offers many ways to stay motivated. Bookmark and highlighting features are A+. Definitely the beast bible reader app around.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|It reminds me a lot of Mario Bros! love it and have nothing to complain about so far! Totally recommend!
B006ON41FC|3.0|This is a fun game. The kids love to play this game. It seems easy but it is hard. The graphics are good on this game.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Its a cool game, but i wish you were able to move buildings instead of having to delete the buildings, and then re-build them.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|this is game is beast not that it is amazing quality but that you can choose from that many games in one app that's balla
B0052U59F4|5.0|Awesome ladies book club book!  You will not want to put it down.  Things will not get completed at home so you can finish a chapter!  :)
B007IXWKUK|1.0|Even though I had the same complaints about book one as everyone else (repetitive words & actions)I still managed to finish and actually enjoyed the chemistry between Ana and Christian.  I can't say the same for book two.  I'm halfway through and if Ana \\"blushes/flushes\\", says \\"oh my\\" or speak to her inner goddess one more time I'm going to scream!!  I honestly expected more depth from book two but I still know very little about each character. Worst of all they are still having boring repetitive sex every couple of pages. I've stopped reading at this point and will not be getting book three because frankly I don't care what happens to either character.  Oh and I've now taken a strong dislike to the words \\"unbidden\\", \\"undoing\\" and \\"convulse\\"
B004O3YGMC|5.0|Had a hard time setting splashtop up, but once I got out running this app is amazing can even print from it.this is a must have app
B007JZGIMS|3.0|I already bought iSyncr (the companion to Rocket Music Player from the same company). They give you for free a limited version of Rocket Music player, but if you already bought their iSyncr (which is actually very good for synchronizing your iTunes playlists) this player should be either free or at least $.99
B006AZZPCM|5.0|Thanks for this app  keep up the great work  it's nice to watch videos and not having to be on wifi
B0051UP5NQ|5.0|This app is perfect for on-the-go editing and creating not only word but power point and excel documents. I find myself using my kindle fire more than the computer to make documents now.
B007PTJOV0|5.0|great game<br />I love this game it<br />reminds me of the old Mario games I played as kid thanks for the game.
0646497855|5.0|Fantastic book ! A must for everyone aiming to make it once in the ielts exam . Got this book and found it easier to understand than the previous books I had seen. Thumbs up for the author, nice one!
