0060282983|5.0|I teach an advanced level of the high school diploma curriculum in adult ESL. (Englsih as a Second Language)The vast majority of my adult students are literate in their first language. Still, one of the most difficult subjects to bridge is English language literature. I began this semester with American literature and purposely selected Charlotte's Web as our starting point. By the end of the first week of reading, there wasn't a student in the class who didn't cherish this book and story. Although E.B. White has written a simple story directed at 9-12 year olds, the themes, metaphors, and literary devices used, are not that simplistic. This story is brimming with universal ideas, needs, and the emotions that all human beings share and it is deeply embedded with American culturalisms. I would highly recommend this book to any ESL teacher at the intermediate-high or above level, adult and grade school, because it is such a personally rewarding story within a managable text for the \\"limited cultural-content\\" reader. It also offers the teacher many different approaches for teaching; from the cultural/humanistic approach to the literary tools for writing approach.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Exciter, the band's previous album, released in 2001, left many DM fans wondering if the band still had it in them to create another \\"exciting\\" album (pun very much intended). Well, Playing the Angel proves fans need not worry - the boys are still on top of their game. They have put together an extremely fun, yet extremely dark and brooding masterpiece that draws from the best elements of past records, while maintaining its own distinctive sound.  <br /> <br />The album begins with the uptempo number, A Pain That I'm Used To. This was one of the three tracks that I allowed myself to listen to before the release date (the entire album leaked beforehand, as is normally the case nowadays). Now, I can't decide whether that was a good choice or not. Hearing that opening note (an alarming and distorted synth) for the first time on release date would have been an interesting (if not heart attack-inducing) experience. Nonetheless, I instantly fell in love with the song's captivating combination of a heavy, yet definitely danceable beat and that infectious gospel-tinged chorus - \\"All this running around, well it's getting me down/Just give me a pain that I'm used to/I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive/You just need to achieve something that rings true.\\" This is slated to be the second single from this album.  <br /> <br />The industrial pop meets gospel method is perfect on the following track, John the Revelator. From the carousel full of fun sounds to the on-target vocal work, the song is an instant success, and the guys from DM knew it. You can hear a bit of well-deserved pride in lead singer Dave Gahan's voice as he asks, \\"Well who's that shouting?/John the Revelator!/All he ever gives us is pain/Well who's that shouting?/John the Revelator!/He should bow his head in shame.\\" The song is brimming with radio potential and is rumored to be the third single.  <br />Suffer Well is the third track on the album, and the first of three to be written by Gahan (PTAis the first time record featuring songs with lyrics not written by Martin Gore). The song somewhat drops the in-your-face approach of the first two tracks while adding that intoxicating, yet nonintrusive guitar that has been creeping its way into DM's work ever since Violator. Make no mistake though, the track is still heavily electronic based (as is the entire album), and although the title may invoke feelings otherwise, this is one of the lighter songs on the record.  <br /> <br />The beautiful brooding continues with The Sinner In Me. One of the darkest and moodiest tracks succeeds where similar songs on other recent DM albums have failed for many - to maintain interest even when they slow things down a bit. This track with its religious-influenced message and its mid-song distorted guitar breakdown, sounds like something that could have been found on 1993's Songs of Faith and Devotion. Next up is the acclaimed first single from the album, Precious. Many fans are putting this on \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" level greatness. While I do not hold out hope that DM will ever regain that level of popularity (especially in the US), I have to say that they could not have done a better job trying. The track features everything that Depeche Mode does best - danceable synth-meets piano line beats, minimal distorted guitar, and an exceptionally contagious chorus - \\"Things get damaged/Things get broken/I thought we'd manage/But words left unspoken/Left us so brittle/There was so little left to give.\\" <br /> <br />Macro is the sixth track on the album and the first to feature Martin Gore on lead vocals. This song is the first to really slow the tempo down considerably. While the song is a difficult listen at first (very unlike the first five extremely catchy tracks), to some it will pay off in the end - the gothic minimalist beat combines with Gore's brooding vocals beautifully. Although normally every DM album features a Gore ballad, I think fans will be split on whether or not thistrack is a success. Continuing with the slower-tempo portion of the album, the second of the Gahan-written songs is track seven, I Want It All. A trip-hop influenced beat (that sounds like it would be right at home on a Massive Attack or Portishead album) backs up Gahan's vocals on this track that could have easily been found on their 1997 album, Ultra. Personally, I think the track is a beautiful success (especially the last two minutes), yet I have the feeling that it could have been condensed to no more than five minutes instead of over six. Some may find this to be a filler or skip-over track. I think that depends on whether you see Ultra as one of your favorite DM albums or consider it to be not-so-memorable.  <br /> <br />Nothing's Impossible picks the pace of the album back up, and is the last of the three Gahan written tracks on the album. This song is one of my favorites as it conjures memories of my favorite DM album, 1986's Black Celebration. To me, this song lyrically resembles a less hopeful \\"But Not Tonight\\" (found on BC). Next up is the inescapable DM instrumental, Introspectre. However well the track does its job of continuing the mood of the album, I agree with others who think the b-side \\"Free\\" (which can be found on the \\"Precious\\" single), or any other b-side for that matter, would have been a more desirable choice here.  <br /> <br />The second of the two songs featuring Martin Gore on lead vocals is track ten, Damaged People. This one is definitely my favorite of the two. The almost creepy music often brings the listener to a point of hope, then wonderfully crushes back down upon us again. Gore's vocal work on the song is perfect (no, not near perfect - just damn perfect) and so fittingly dark that it makes you feel like he was simply aching to sing the words, \\"When you're in my arms/The world makes sense/There is no pretense/And you're crying/When you're by my side/There is no defense/I forget to sense/I'm dying.\\" The next track, Lilian soundslike classic DM and reminds me a lot of what \\"Precious\\" would sound like had it been released on either Music for the Masses or Violator. Lyrically, it encompasses the general mood of the entire album - \\"pain and misery always hit the spot, knowing you can't lose what you haven't got.\\"  <br /> <br />The last track on the album is The Darkest Star. This is the song where the album garnered its name from. This, along with \\"Damaged People\\" are the two most morose tracks on the album. The Darkest Star is a slow, intensely haunting closing track that may unsettle you somewhat, and most likely takes the cake as the darkest on the album - lyrically and musically. Lyrically, it doesn't get much more macabre than this, \\"Oh you sad one/Playing the angel/Isn't so easy where you're from/Oh you wild one/Devil's companion/You won't stay satisfied for long...I don't want you to change anything you do/I don't want you to be someone else for me/Stay as you are the darkest star.\\" And the pounding piano and synth lines back up the somber lyrics and vocal work of Gahan most fittingly.  <br /> <br />4.5 Stars in reality, but 5.0 just because that's not an option!

0224071262|1.0|This book is a Nazi-style hymn of hate against China. Like any 19th-century imperialist, Jung Chang and Jon Halliday picture China as a backward and barbarian country. In her hatred of Mao, they insult every great movement which he led - the national resistance to Japanese aggression, China's land reform, the struggles to unify China and to assert Chinese sovereignty, the assistance to Korea's and Vietnam's defensive wars against US aggression, and building China's industry and nuclear bomb. Trashing him is also trashing all those who worked for these great achievements.<br /><br />The only sure thing in this book is the authors' bias; their sources are dubious. All too many are \\"interviews recorded with Mao's relatives, friends, and acquaintances, done in the 1960s, unpublished.\\" As Professor Michael Yahuda noted in the Guardian of 4 June 2005, \\"There is no discussion of the quality of the sources or how they were used. The motives of people in general and of Mao in particular are asserted rather than evaluated.\\" There is no economic, social or political evidence or analysis, just repeated denunciation.<br /><br />The authors write of Mao's `ineffectiveness at organizing labour', yet note in the same paragraph that he \\"led a numbers of demonstrations and strikes\\" and was \\"negotiating on behalf of the builders' union\\". They write, \\"Stalin blocked Mao from meeting any foreign communist leader\\", then, just seven pages later, they describe Mao's meeting with Ho Chi Minh.<br /><br />They blame communism, not the Japanese state, for Japan's attack on China in the 1930s - heading their chapter `Red Mole Triggers China-Japan War'. They claim that the Red Army never fought the Japanese invader and never won a battle in its later, victorious war against the Kuomintang.<br /><br />They blame Mao for the US state's 30-year-long refusal to recognise China. They claim, \\"Mao may have helped cause Stalin's stroke.\\" They write, \\"Mao was to blame\\" for the counter-revolutionary massacre of Indonesians in 1965. They also blame Mao for the Berlin Wall and for the US escalation of war against Vietnam.<br /><br />They blame Mao for huge numbers of deaths, but never give evidence or references. They just repeat their figures, adding `probably', `very probably' and `could well'. They mention achievements, like the suppression of banditry, gangsterism, drug-dealing, gambling and prostitution, in only a sentence. They dismiss as corrupted China's support for the national liberation struggles of Korea, Vietnam, Algeria and Cuba.<br /><br />Frank McLynn wrote in the Independent on Sunday of 5 June, \\"this one-sided rant leaves one with no understanding of modern China ... There is a lot of bad history in all senses in this volume. ... Everything that can be construed as working in Mao's favour during his struggle with Chiang is freighted with a meaning it cannot bear ... On the Korean war the authors revive the old myth about `hordes' of Chinese swamping the American army and defeating them by sheer weight of numbers, which was simply propaganda put out by the Pentagon, embarrassed by the poor showing of the US Marine Corps. And who is their historical source for the Chinese `human waves'? Michael Caine. Come again? Yes, I do mean that Michael Caine, the movie actor, whose personal memories of the Korean War are given the status of holy writ.\\"<br /><br />\\"But why bother with the tiresome discipline of historical research when you can make wild assertions buttressed by unknown or suspect oral sources that are (in the authors' recurrent mantra) `little known today'. ... If you can believe that Chou-en-lai, the master diplomat who wowed everyone from Kissinger to Orson Welles, really was a hypermasochistic craven nonentity who played lickspittle and toady to Mao for no apparent reason (at least the authors do not suggest one) ... this book has a certain entertainment value. But it is neither serious history nor serious biography.\\"<br /><br />Naturally, professional anticommunists like Roy Hattersley, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Max Hastings, Robert Service, Lord Patten and Chris Harman praise the book despite all its faults./>Naturally, professional anticommunists like Roy Hattersley, Simon Sebag Montefiore, Sir Max Hastings, Robert Service, Lord Patten and Chris Harman praise the book despite all its faults. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I am a HUGE DM fan and have been since 1984, but this new CD PTA has me so excited!!!!  The first 6 tracks are all terrific.  Really strong opening to a really good offering.  The last half of the album is a bit slow and dark, but LILLIAN is interesting.  I really love SUFFER WELL, John the Revelator, A Pain that I am use to, and PRECIOUS!  Looking forward to Nov. 5th in ATLANTA.
0307276902|5.0|My brother just committed suicide partially because of or maybe entirely because of alcohol addiction.  In the airport on the way home from the memorial for him, I found this book.  I read half of it on the plane - hoping for answers.  I found a few in Mr. Frey's vivid descriptions of the helpless, hopeless, endlessly disappointing battles with addictions.  It is a bittersweet explanation to me of what my beautiful brother must have been dealing with.  Over and over again he redeemed himself but in the end he must have seen no way out and so he ended the addiction and his shame and disappointment in the most logical way he could think of.  I don't know how his story could have been any different and reading this book makes me realize how hard he must have fought and none of us in the family ever knew.   <br /> <br />As to the mechanics of the writing, it's visceral and eloquent and blunt and meaningful and angry and defiant.  A masterpiece of truth telling.  I hope that families of folks with addictions will read it and take some solace or at least a glimmer of what their beloved addicts life must be like.  And finally, it is a piece of hope that some others may have the good fortune to make it back from the abyss.   <br /> <br />This book helped me accept my brother for what he was and what he did.   <br /> <br />Thanks, Mr. Frey.  I hope that if this is your true story that you continue to win the battle.  Life without my brother, addicted though he was, is really unbearable.  Life without you, I would imagine, would be unbearable for all of us because of your eloquent sharing of your experience. <br /> <br />Thanks for being so brutally honest.  Your efforts have helped me understand my brother a little better and the choice he made at the end. <br /> <br />I recommend this book to anyone whose life has been touched by the losing someone to addiction and to anyone looking for satisfying, beautiful, honest, gifted storytelling.  If you do not have anyone like thisin your life, it's still a great book, passionate and honest with a grim humor that makes it bearable to read the truth of an addicts life.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|Finally a movie that captures the nature of the Dark Knight and makes me hope this team will continue the series in the same vein. This is a fantastic movie, which must be watched. Not only was a good script written. But Christian Bale is perfect as both Bruce Wayne and as Batman. During the parts of the movie were we watch Bruce Wayne, not once did I wonder where Batman was. He played Bruce Wayne so well...I wanted to see what Bruce would do next. And then you have a fantastic cast surrounding him. This is a winning formula. <br /> <br />Batman Begins takes us back to the beginning. And shows us how Bruce Wayne get the skills to be Batman. And within this story we see how he chose the symbol of the bat. The movie jumps over his youth where Alfred raises him. But takes us to the end of the trial of his parent's murderer where he his vengeance has pushed him. Bruce learns that though he is filled with anger and feels he has nothing to lose...he does. So Bruce discards his identity and travels throughout the world learning all he can about the criminal mind. For as he was told, you only fear what you do not know.  <br /> <br />We also see the process he goes through to not only condition his body, but to learn martial arts. The disillusioned Bruce is enticed by mysterious League of Shadows who claim to fame is dispensing Justice. And it is here that Bruce learns to channel his anger and fears into his newly honed skills. Making him a true fighting machine. But he learns he cannot follow the leagues methods, for they do not only dispense justice...but also go to the extreme and become the judge and executioner as well. A line Bruce will not cross. He finally decides he needs to go home to Gotham and help stop its downward spiral into corruption. And Batman is born. <br /> <br />The extra material not only includes the movie's trailer, a wonderful plethora of posters, but a spoof on Batman staring Jimmy Fallon on his way to an MTV Movie Award program. The spoof is welldone, fun and silly all at the same time. There is also eight short features that cover everything from the Batmobile being built, casting, Mr. Bale's conditioning, all the great work on the Bat Suit, the sets being built and what I thought was most impressive, the filming in Iceland.  <br /> <br />The included comic book shows more of what Bruce Wayne did to prepare himself in his travels and schooling to become Batman. And it has a couple of other stories in it as well. One, which includes Harvey Dent, called The Long Halloween. All in all the deluxe set is a winner. <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />
0553573403|2.0|I am astounded by how many people are in love with this series, but it is nothing new or interesting.  Perhaps it is different in the Fantasy Genre, but it's a mistake to take different as necessarily good.<br /><br />Many readers look deeply into the situation and find depth, but though you may found depth, the big picture is still a piece of crap.  The main plot is still unimaginative and fails to rival tolkien and Jordan.  I laughed when the comparisons are placed because when it comes to FANTASY Martin is lacking that certain aspect that captivates the human imagination.<br /><br />There's alot of real, but not enough FANTASY. the only fantasy was a nomadic group, big woop.  And some parts at the end where there was some witch doctor dance ritual, OH please!  There are some moments of descriptive parts, but they are fleeting.  We are left with twists that look more like straight lines.<br /><br />And is it me but the raw explict scenes are unnecessary.  You can pull off a dark theme without having to be so crude.  I could care less about the details of the incest going on.<br /><br />But all in all it can be ok, if you like plots without great complexity.  Alot of things happening at once is not complex, it's just distracting.<br /><br />It's simply a medival story with a dark plot sprinkled with some original ideas.<br /><br />And one last thing.  People talking about shades of grey and black/white.  It can be interesting but that didn't make the story any better.  So if you want to FEEL smart and FEEL adult simply because there are \\"shades of grey\\" which everyone thinks are sooo dynamic and complex, Go ahead and read this story. But in the end you recall the plot and you ask yourself why you wasted your time.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|The  masterful guitar playing, drums, and vocals are all tied together to make a truly great piece of music. They have implemented more singing which makes them more marketable and rightfully so. While some may be dissapointed in this transition, others will welcome it, and cherish it. That's just how it goes.  <br /> <br />This band is very talented to say the least, and something that you don't hear very often. I can't compare it to anything really, I guess it has a little Metallica flare to it. Impressive guitar solos were a thing of the past until A7X gave me at least a taste of technical modern rock. Nothin short of specatacular.
B0001HAISG|4.0|Truly magnificent acting, amazing special effects, and an honestly-crafted screenplay make this the best Peter Pan movie of all time. I was a bit skeptical at first, but as a Jason Isaacs fan, couldn't resist watching anyway. And I certainly was not disappointed. This movie exceeded my expectations in everyway (even my father enjoyed it). I don't want to talk it up too much, though, (there seem to be plenty of others eager to do so in any event) as I always find \\"hype\\" off-putting. So...stay away from this movie if you must, but if even part of you is leaning toward giving it a peek, I say go for it!
B0000024K1|5.0|This album is a straight up classic. This is the first public enemy album that i bought, and i'm definitely going to get more. I was sort of hesitant about buying any public enemy at first because i expected their style to be way different but its awesome. Anyway, i reccomend this to any fan of hip hop.
B000002JOH|5.0|one of the most influential heavy metal albums of the 1990s, Vulgar Display of Power is just what is says: a raw, pulverizing, insanely intense depiction of naked rage and hostility that drains its listeners and pounds them into submission. even the \\"ballads,\\" \\"This Love\\" and \\"Hollow,\\" have thunderingly loud, aggressive chorus sections. preaching power through strength and integrity, Phil Anselmo discards any further attempts at singing in favor of a militaristic bark and an unhinged roar, while the crystal-clear production sets Diamond Darrell's pummeling riffs against a rhythmic backdrop so thunderously supportive that Darrell often solos without underlying rhythm guitar parts. the album again follows Cowboys From Hell's strategy of stacking the best songs at the beginning and letting their momentum carry the listener through the rest, but the riffs and sonic textures are more consistently interesting this time around. Pantera's thick-sounding, post-hardcore power metal and outraged, testosterone-drenched intensity would help pave the way for alternative metal acts like Korn and Tool; Vulgar Display of Power is the best distillation of those virtues.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Ok, I think we can all agree that Exciter was a dud, a good album, but not up to DM standards.  Well, the Depeche Mode of Black Celebration, Violator, and SOFAD is back here in full force and no apologies.  \\"A Pain that I'm Used to\\" is my favorite, an instant DM classic.  \\"Precious\\" has already shot to number 1 in the billboards in most of northern Europe and will soon do the same here.
B000001Y42|5.0|with their major-label debut, Three Dollar Bill Y'All, Limp Bizkit quickly rose to the top of the alt-metal subgenre known as \\"rapcore.\\" part of the reason the band stood out from their peers was their kinetic, frenzied energy. they might not have many original ideas -- they are largely an outgrowth of Korn, Faith No More, and the Red Hot Chili Peppers -- but they do the sound well. they have a powerful rhythm section, memorable hooks, and easily relatable lyrics.
0679422714|2.0|This book is not really a history book as such. Rather it is a book designed to remove Mao from his current position as the founder of modern China. The authors of this book would like to have his statues pulled down and for him to be vilified in the same way that Hitler and Pol P0t are in their respective countries.  <br />  <br />Most people agree that Chairman Mao was a person who oversaw two major disasters in modern Chinese history, the Great Leap Forward and the Cultural Revolution. It is also clear that he was responsible for the deaths of millions of Chinese. A number of historians would see him however as the one who was responsible for the formation of China as a strong modern state. The authors of this book however suggest that not only was he responsible for those misfortunes that he had no positive qualities whatsoever.  <br /> <br />This makes the book somewhat artificial. It is clear that Mao at the beginning of the civil war had about one million troops under his command supplied with Japanese weapons captured in the north of the country. The nationalists had about four million and they were supplied with much superior American weapons. It was of course the nationalist who lost. This suggests that Mao had some military talent or some ability to forge an army that could take on great numbers and win. The authors have to come up with strange and convoluted stories suggesting that the Nationalist generals who lost were secret moles paid off by Stalin. This is despite the fact that there is no evidence to suggest that this was the case. In fact most of the generals so slighted moved to Taiwan after the end of the war and lived in exile till they died.  <br /> <br />Through the book strange theories are trotted out to try to explain away Mao success while every wart is revealed. Thus again to explain Mao's survival in the 30's it is argued that Stalin kept Chiang Kai Shek's son a hostage and this is the reason that Mao survived. However Chiang's son did not prevent him killing the communist leadership in Shanghai in 1927. In addition the book suggests against the evidence that Mao was unmoved by the death of his son in the Korean war. This appears to be against most accounts.  <br /> <br />Still the book is readable and it helps to counterbalance some of the earlier material produced by writers such as Edgar Snow which we can now see as simple propaganda. The book is thus useful in establishing that Mao ducked fighting the Japanese more than the Nationalists did. His regime was always oppressive and his economic ideas were moronic. However a lot of the ideas that are little more than theories are trumped out as if they are well established fact in this rather strange book.   <br /> <br /> <br />

B0002OERI0|3.0|People should just take this album as it is and stop complaining by adding petty little digs. So what if its not 'punk', or that they're 'sellouts' does it really matter?     I mean, I couldnt careless! i LOVE this CD, so i mean for them to break out of the petty underground punk scene and make some money is just good for them. Cos they deserve it. As long as you enjoy listening to something, it shouldn't matter if its 'cool' or not.        Anyways..... This is a good cd from a damn good band. Most of the songs on here are really great. They're also really catchy. You guys should deffinatly go out and get it. It's a must have.    I'm only giving it 4 stars though. (okay maybe im being a bit harsh cos it is really good) It's just that i fell in love with Green Day for their old stuff, it's a great CD, it's just that i'd still rate Dookie and Nimrod before this one. (i would DEFFINATLY reccomend these in addition.)    My favourites:  Boulevard of Broken Dreams  When September Ends  LetterBomb  Jesus of Suburbia    I love all the songs on here, but these are just my favourites.  If you like Green Day you should deffinatly go get Dookie or Nimrod cos they are also awsome. (Also theyre amazing live. A bit irrelivant to this i know, but i've seen them twice this year, and they are by far the best people ive ever seen live.)
0380789019|5.0|Since I had never read anything from this author I didn't know what to expect. I was surprised to find myself pulled into the story from the first few pages. The characters and the plot were different than much of the content of todays books. At the end of the book I couldn't help but yell out loud, \\"Yes!\\".  <br /> If you want a unique story pick this book up, you will not be disappointed.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|If the theme to Exciter is love, then the overall theme to Playing the Angel is pain (and in this case, I will take pain over love any day!). But at times, it is really painfull to listen to...quite physically speaking. I'm sure, for some reason unbeknownst to the general public, that this is intentional. Really, the bulk of the album is a bit over-saturated with distortion - that kind of distortion that you would hear on analog tape when recording a very hot signal. I'm sure if Alan were with the band, he wouldn't have allowed this..but there I go with my opinion.    If you can get over the distortion bit, we're looking at classic Depeche Mode songwriting! Each song has some hook that grabs your attention and then sucks you in. When I first heard SOFAD, it was the same way...I didn't really like it at first...but the more I listened to it, the more I loved it. The same is true with Playing the Angel...unlike Ultra (which I immediately fell in love with), you need to give it a few listens. And I think you can experience something wonderful to allow a really good album to slowly grow on you.    The entire album is pretty dark with an occasional ray of light here and there: Like the quote says on the back, it's \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\"....but it's an optimistic pain. True to Depeche Mode nature, Playing the Angel sounds completely different from any previous album and has a common groove from song #1 to the finale. I haven't listened to Free yet (off the Precious single), but I hear it should've been included on the album too.    I really don't want to get too far in depth and spoil things for any DM fan that hasn't listened to it yet, but I can assure you that it's worth picking up. The special DVD version has some extra goodies, including a Behind the scenes, and 5.1 mix, which is very cool and worth buying for it alone. Some of my favs so far are: Suffer Well, I Want it All, Lilian and The Sinner in Me.     Enjoy!
B000062YAZ|5.0|widely considered the pinnacle of speed metal, Reign in Blood is Slayer's undisputed masterpiece, a brief (under half an hour) but relentless onslaught that instantly obliterates anything in its path and clears out just as quickly. producer Rick Rubin gives the band a clear, punchy sound for the first time in its career, and they largely discard the extended pieces of Hell Awaits in favor of lean assaults somewhat reminiscent of hardcore punk (though distinctly metallic and much more technically demanding). Reign in Blood opens and closes with slightly longer tracks (the classics \\"Angel of Death\\" and \\"Raining Blood\\") whose slower riffs offer most of the album's few hints of melody. sandwiched in between are eight short (all under three minutes), lightning-fast bursts of aggression that change tempo or feel without warning, producing a disjointed, barely controlled effect. the album is actually more precise than it sounds, and not without a sense of groove, but even in the brief slowdowns, the intensity never lets up. there may not be much variation, but it's a unified vision, and a horrific one at that. the riffs are built on atonal chromaticism that sounds as sickening as the graphic violence depicted in many of the lyrics, and Kerry King and Jeff Hanneman's demented soloing often mimics the screams of the songs' victims. it's monstrously, terrifyingly evocative, in a way that transcends Reign in Blood's metal origins. the album almost single-handedly inspired the entire death metal genre (at least on the American side of the Atlantic), and unlike many of its imitators, it never crosses the line into self-parodic overkill. Reign in Blood was a stone-cold classic upon its release, and it hasn't lost an ounce of its power today.
B00004TWZF|4.0|Luc Besson's sense of humor throughout the movie is just the right amount of seasoning which softens the dramatic beginning. Jean Reno (Enzo) perfectly performs a Sicilian character competing his old friend Jacques who both witness Jacques' father never coming out of the sea while sponge diving back in their childhood. It triggers Jacques to dive and disconnetcs him from the earth where he thinks he finds love and life under the water subconsicously looking out for his father. When Enzo calls out for a competition to Jacques, the movie gets more exciting. Rosanna Arquette plays one of her usual characters which I find she is good at and the most suitable actress for this movie tries to get in between Jacques and his underwater world with Dolphins. After several diving sessions Jacques also loses Enzo under the water who can not make it. The only person whom Jacques asks everything to teach him can not do that any more. Sometimes I come across and read  that they are doing the the Big Blue 2 ! With this end,  BB2 can only be a commercial movie nothing further ! This movie from laughter to tears, has more than you can imagine and it is too good to make a second movie. It is a collection DVD for me and I keep watching it almost once every year.
0743201140|1.0|No, the test results seem random. For example I got \\"Strategic\\" as one of my top-5 strengths.  <br /> <br />Hah hah, sorry - I bought 25% of my house and rented 75% of it when we moved in (to get on the property ladder). THAT was 15 years ago !! (I'll get round to buying the rest - er, soon). <br /> <br />Strategic is never, never, one of my strengths. <br /> <br />I would really like these nice things to be true - who doesn't like being flattered.  <br /> <br />But no. Reminds me of a horoscope. <br /> <br />
B000009QOC|5.0|What a great album, after listening to the Misfits I decided to get into Glen's solo act, and it shows how he could really utilize his awsome vocals. I love the dark bluesy rock, songs like \\"Killer Wolf\\" and \\"Her Black Wings' are classics. Definetely reccomend this.
0375703861|4.0|Told in episodic spurts this uneven story follows three intertwined families through three generations. Characters are introduced in a linear manner. In the order in which they begin to twine into the other character's lives. One or two things did bother me. Things like the anachronistic use of the term \\"flares\\" rather than \\"bell bottoms\\" to describe a pair of pants in the 70s. The theme of the book takes some time to discover, but is worth finding. The experience of immigrants and the struggle of the second generation to find a sense of belonging is subtly offered to the reader. The author also acknowledges that it is not only immigrants that seek a sense of belonging. All in all a lovely read.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|If the theme to Exciter is love, then the overall theme to Playing the Angel is pain (and in this case, I will take pain over love any day!). But at times, it is really painfull to listen to...quite physically speaking. I'm sure, for some reason unbeknownst to the general public, that this is intentional. Really, the bulk of the album is a bit over-saturated with distortion - that kind of distortion that you would hear on analog tape when recording a very hot signal. I'm sure if Alan were with the band, he wouldn't have allowed this..but there I go with my opinion.    If you can get over the distortion bit, we're looking at classic Depeche Mode songwriting! Each song has some hook that grabs your attention and then sucks you in. When I first heard SOFAD, it was the same way...I didn't really like it at first...but the more I listened to it, the more I loved it. The same is true with Playing the Angel...unlike Ultra (which I immediately fell in love with), you need to give it a few listens. And I think you can experience something wonderful to allow a really good album to slowly grow on you.    The entire album is pretty dark with an occasional ray of light here and there: Like the quote says on the back, it's \\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\"....but it's an optimistic pain. True to Depeche Mode nature, Playing the Angel sounds completely different from any previous album and has a common groove from song #1 to the finale. I haven't listened to Free yet (off the Precious single), but I hear it should've been included on the album too.    I really don't want to get too far in depth and spoil things for any DM fan that hasn't listened to it yet, but I can assure you that it's worth picking up. The special DVD version has some extra goodies, including a Behind the scenes, and 5.1 mix, which is very cool and worth buying for it alone. Some of my favs so far are: Suffer Well, I Want it All, Lilian and The Sinner in Me.     Enjoy!
B00005JKGK|1.0|I had to stop watching this stupid movie half way. <br /> <br />The movie was just so one-sided against Asian men. <br />One man was an abusive gangster. <br />The second one was the worst. He was bald, wore glasses and was so cheap that he pays his wife 7 times less than himself, and makes her buy ice-cream that she doesn't eat. <br /> <br />I don't know what she has against Asian men. Maybe it's because she resents her father and brother for dying from brain cancer during her youth. <br /> <br />This movie is even worse to Asian men then the Color Purple was to Black American men. <br /> <br />By the way, Asian culture protrayed by Amy Tan is NOT typical of Chinese Americans. From what I remember from her biography, she spent most of her early life with her crazy mother in Europe, so she doesn't know anything.
B0000AMRJC|5.0|Great actor, great movie. You don't need to read any review about this movie. Don't think, add to cart...
0805076476|4.0|This book doesn't way in at much over 200 pages, and is one of the few cases I've ever seen where the movie was as good, if not better, than the book. It's a good read, but I don't think it's something I would read more than once.
B00006EXL5|5.0|Well MCR is not a Secret Underground Rock (they say they are rock not emo) band anymore....  Everyone knows My Chemical Romance Now!!!  Third CD coming soon, Nov. 8th '05 I believe! <br /> <br />Just for the record, HEADFIRST FOR HALOS is one of the best songs ever by MCR.  I also love, HONEY, This Mirror isnt Big Enuff For the Two of Us!!!  The BEST DAY EVER (the day he left the hospital) has the best guitar riffs and its one of those QUICKIES you just have to put on REPEAT!! <br /> <br />This was their first CD, but NOT a lesser model by any means.  each song on this CD sets the stage for the upcomming events between the LOVERS and the DEVIL.  Aside from, SkyLines and Turnstyles which illuminates the tragedy of September 11th. <br /> <br />Being NJ natives, Manhattan is a train ride away.  The story goes, Gerard way was in NYC around 9/11 trying to get his cartoon sold to the cable channel, Cartoon Network.  After 9/11 he decided to put his artistic abilities towards music, and express his emotions about the terror of the 9/11 event.  Hence the first song was written, Skylines and Turnstyles. <br /> <br />Just a bit of trivia for you, hope you enjoyed it. <br /> <br />One of the Bands Ever!! <br /> <br />

B00028HBKM|4.0|Well, at the time I am writing this, over 1,800 people have written reviews on THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST.  Now, regardless of whether these reviewers think the film is good or not, I think it is absolutely dishonest to say that the film is completely not worth seeing.  Any film that manages to spark so much controversy and polarize audiences is bound to be worth seeing-if only to get a glimpse for yourself of what people are talking about.  So, unlike most of my reviews, I will say upfront: THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST is worth seeing.  In what follows, I will give you a sense of my thoughts as I was watching the film.<br /><br />During my childhood, I was a practicing Catholic and attended mass every week (often twice).  Each year, we would go through the Passion meticulously around Easter.  The story would be related several times, the stations of the cross would be observed, and so forth.  The upshot is, this is a story that any practicing Christian should know like the back of his or her hand.  Yet, despite the fact that I have heard this story so many times and seen so many films about it, THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST manages to bring a different perspective and a whole-new-level of reality to the story that just cannot be communicated in spoken words.  Sure, I sat there waiting for each of the stations to occur.  I waited for the lines.  If you grew up in a church, you will know several of the film's lines before they are uttered.<br /><br />But I would like to focus on the film's graphic violence, since this seems to strike the largest amount of controversy in the entire movie.  Is it violent?  Yes, it is.  I would not recommend this movie for children.  But I don't know what everyone is so upset about.  The Passion is a violent story.  The brutality is described in the New Testament and, until Gibson decided to go for it, that brutality has never adequately reached the screen.  The story is supposed to center on Jesus, a man who is human and divine, suffering for all of the sins of humankind.  His suffering has to be greater than any other human being is capable of withstanding.  In previous films and versions, the lack of absolute brutality allows the audience to sit back and \\"enjoy\\" the Passion.  But this is not a story that is meant to be enjoyed.  THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST, in my opinion, is the only film that really \\"gets\\" that.  Gibson's \\"bloodbath\\" finally communicates, in horrifying detail, the absolute suffering of Jesus Christ.<br /><br />Now, regardless of whether you are a \\"believer,\\" I think you will get something out of this film.  I am no longer a practicing Catholic, but that doesn't prevent me from standing back in thoughtful contemplation after this film.  It is a good film and it is obviously a labor of love.  I think that it will stand the test of time and provide a powerful religious experience for those who are believers.  Some have complained that it doesn't preach \\"Christian\\" values.  If you think this, you are blind.  The quiet suffering of a man dying for the sins of humankind, praying for his torturers, is at the heart of the Christian faith.  Do not watch THE PASSION OF THE CHRIST to be entertained.  Watch it either to reflect on your own beliefs or to reflect on the beliefs of those around you in our society.g for all of the sins of humankind.

0553108034|5.0|\\"A Clash of Kings\\", the second novel in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, continues the adventures of earlier characters next to new additions.  Unlike the prior novel that was exceptionally precise, I found subtle differences including more character interaction and internal dialog while maintaining the excellent storyline quality with shocking encounters and political drama.  The series is grim fantasy, filled with brutal and extreme experiences and not for the carefree reader.<br /><br />The crafty battles are ingenious, further enhancing an already exceptional tale with deliberate tactics.  The most noticeable change includes the early stages of the supernatural creeping into the character lives.  I anticipate more magic as the series develops.  The realistic political spectrum can be confusing with dozens of lords and knights switching allegiance and may leave one continuously trying to remember the relationships and reasons for such changes.<br /><br />A greater assortment of major and minor characters, from lords to stable boys, requires a more detailed appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order.  Some portions of the map could have incorporated further detail especially the continents where the story relates plus where Daenerys' storyline exists.<br /><br />I highly recommend this series to any fan of the fantasy genre.<br /><br />Thank you.
B00005LC4B|4.0|This is a great movie!  De Niro is wonderful as always and you will find yourself sitting on the edge of your seat with suspense waiting to see what happens next.  A star filled class makes what was already a great movie ever better.  You will not be dissappointed, get it today.
B000AARKO4|1.0|Ridley Scott proudly stated that his film was \\"real history\\", nothing could be further from the truth!     The underlying messages within the film, and Scotts take on the main theme, seem to reflect an Islamic Terrorists version of medieval history.    Firstly the Knight Templars are portrayed as Racist, blood thirsty savages, who beleived in killing Muslims at will. If you read the Muslim literature for the 12th C, you will find that the Muslims preffered the Knight Templars to the Secular Crusaders coming from France and the rest of Europe. The Muslim chronicles respected the Templars as terrifying in battle, and extemely pious in their religous beliefs. The Templars spirtual leader in the 12th C, Abbot Bernard, states in his letters to the Templars, that killing the Muslims should be avoided if possible, as they should be convereted peacefully. However, he stated that force should be used to reconquer the lands in the East that the muslims had conqured from the christians. The muslim chronicles (such as Usamas famous 12th centuary chronicle) state that the secular crusaders arriving in the holy land (such as Balian in the film) where far worse in there pursuit of killing muslims at any opportunity, than the Templars and Syrian born Franks.     The historical Balian was not from France but born in Syria to an already established noble family. In the film Baliam questions his faith and christianity in general. The historical Balian never did this; in fact, on the way to battle once he ordered the halt of the army as he realised he had missed mass, and would not continue until it was completed.    Raymond of Tripoli is one of the great heros in the film. This could not be further from the truth as he was an undeniable traitor. The majoirty of Latin, Syriac, Armenian and more interstingly, Muslim historiacl sources, clearly describe his betrayal of the Christians. One Armenian source even states that he had converted to Islam and had been circumised. Baha al Din (Saladins personal biographer) states that Raymond had a secret alliance with the Muslims and betrayed the Christians at the battle of Hattin, by convincing King Guy to let him lead the bulk of the Christians heavy cavalry in a charge against the Muslims. However when the charge reached the Muslim lines the Muslims made a clear path for him to pass through (in a prearranged plan) deserting the remaining Christian army to its fate.    Saladin, portrayed as a peace loving hero in the film, was nothing of the sort. His greatest wish, according to Baha al din, who wrote a biography on Saladin, was to cross the sea to Europe and wipe out the Christians, forcing all of Europe to bow to Islam. Saladin killed millions of Muslims during his career, spending the bulk of his life attacking other muslims, not christians. The film states that King Baldwin was a friend of Saladin, again, this is totally untrue.      As for the hero Balian, he was a traitor, and supporter of Raymond of Tripoli. Raymond and the Balians betrayed the Christian crusaders of the East to Saladin, at the battle of Hattin, and later surrended Jersalem to the Muslims, without a real fight.    The film is complete rubbish, painting a completley false picture of the Crusaders. In a nut shell, the film paints the christians as evil, racist, war mongers, and the Muslims as peace loving, pious people who were forced into attacking the christians, due to christian agression!!    Ridley Scott is guilty of addeing fuel to the flames of Islamic Terrorism at a very dangerous time in history. He forgets, that since the C7th the Muslims were committed to spreading Islam by the sword, which is the real reason that prompted the first crusade.    To quote Jonathan Riley Smith, Head of Medieval History at Cambridge University, 'History is the first victim'.
B000ANVQ0K|5.0|Just a respose to Kitty.... <br /> <br />This movie was very intentionally put on 2 disks.

0553103547|5.0|\\"A Game of Thrones\\", the first novel in the \\"A Song of Ice and Fire\\" saga, follows several individuals of royalty ranging from the protagonist and antagonist spectrum.  The author superbly weaves an intense story with a careful mix of bloody encounters and political drama.  The series is grim fantasy, filled with brutal and extreme experiences and not for the carefree reader.  One should not expect vast amounts of spell casting or the typical peon-to-savior story but a well-developed world with mysterious complex characters and minimal magic.<br /><br />Each chapter chronicles a different persons point of view, imparting cheers for a supposed hero or grudging respect due to insight into the subtle rival mind.  Political maneuvering governs the majority of the storyline scattered with small parts of action involving magic or melee.  Nothing occurs without a reason establishing a precise story.<br /><br />The great assortment of major and minor characters, from lords to stable boys, might leave one hoping for a more detailed appendix, perhaps a section in alphabetical order.

B000AARKOO|4.0|I had heard this movie wasn't good at all, but I still wanted to see it and ended up buying it, sight unseen.  What a great movie this ended up being.  I didn't find it bogged down with a bunch of BS, over the top special effects, or just plain badness.  Masterfully put together and wonderfully entertaining, this is a movie you will want to watch over and over again.  Oh and Orlando Bloom plays a Blacksmith who can sword fight in an epic film, never would have I guessed that. ;) <br />This movie is worth your time.
B000067CPX|5.0|I am still amazed every time I hear this album that they did not win the grammy for Best Album Of The Year.. The musicianship and creativity on this album is so mind-blowing that it will continue to amaze you everytime you hear it. It is definitely a song-to-song album, meaning that every single song is incredible and creates a whole piece of art that is greater than the sum of it's parts.. As a young lad growing up, the first CD I ever bought was Uplift Mofo Party Plan during the week that Mother's Milk was released.. I have always revered the RHCP among the legends of the world.. This album holds a special place in my heart, I had just finished basic training and arrived at tech school when it came out on the July 4th weekend of 2002.. This album got me through the daily grind that is military life.. As a guitar player since age eleven, and an aspiring singer/songwriter, this music makes my mind whirl and vibrate with flowing energy that is harmonious and true.. <br />Just want to say a big thanks to the chilis for constantly providing inspiration and upward mobility to the soundtrack of my life and many others.. And for anyone that is reading this, go buy John's solo records if you haven't already.. And read Scar Tissue.. <br />Luvluvluvluvluvluvluv
B00005JNTX|3.0|What can I say about the movie.  The movie itself is amazing...no pure Genius.  Frank Miller's comics are riveting and with his guiding hand, Robert Rodriguez could not have translated his masterpiece to the screen any better.  Together they set a new standard for comic movies and noir.   <br /> <br />HOWEVER!  I would not advise buying this DVD yet.  The extended and Uncut version will be released within months.  That is the only reason this DVD got only 3 stars...otherwise it would have easily gotten 5.  The DVD set to release in December will be more than worth your wait. <br /> <br />In sum, the movie, the acting, the style, everything about the film itself is amazing, ingenious, the description can go on.  but WAIT for the extended DVD in December.  It is WORTH IT!
B000002KIE|1.0|Alright, I used to be a huge fan of the Sex Pistols then I realized that there were WAY better bands out there then them.  Sid Vicious was nothing but a coat on a hanger (only there for publicity purposes) and I don't understand how girls can find him attractive all he was, was a heroin addict who cut himself on stage (Yes Iggy Pop did this too but at least he was good and is an artist) he also ended up killing his girlfriend. He couldn't even play the bass!!  Not to mention that horrible T-shirt with the swastika he used to wear and for what reason other than to make people mad and get attention.  Johnny \\"Rotten\\" is just jerk off.  If you want \\"Political\\" punk then save your money and get some Sham 69 maybe even some Crass, but then again there's only so much screaming one can take
0316921173|4.0|Location (location location) does matter: I read _Infinite Jest_ at Austen Riggs, an off-meds treatment center, an out of pocket institution whose population tends to the very young very rich sporadically educated occasionally smart unreservedly verbal, and, during my tenure, disproportionately female.  If it's not paradise it's at least a be-careful-for-what-you-wish cautionary tale: and yes, the tennis is good.<br /><br />Whatever Wallace's thesis may be, he's surely on to something.  Is the word 'obsession'?  And despite _IJ_'s tortured and torturous plot, there's a wealth of perceptive observation here -- the whack-nut populist president, for example, is disconcertingly familiar; the circuitous musings re marijuana dependence ring similarly true; as for the athletics, well, i would have had to take DFW's authority on faith were I not rooming with a professional player (disabled by social anxiety) who vouched utterly for the details of _IJ_'s game.<br /><br />I do not suffer books lightly: lord knows this sloppy, self-indulgent book would not have rated more than a hundred pages of tolerance had I not been reading it in a mental hospital.  However, several important elements were in place: I had a rabidly enthusiastic DFW coach and cheerleader, and I had a social context which was unendingly impressed with the heft of the book I was carrying around.<br /><br />Your mileage will certainly vary, but take my advice nevertheless: don't read this book alone.  For long long stretches it's depressingly unrewarding.  When it's funny you will need to share the joke.  When it's done, you will feel dirty & used unless you have another survivor with whom to compare notes.<br /><br />As for the persistent claim that Wallace is the real McCoy, a genius, well, I've read his other stuff: he's not.  Is it fair to quote Nabokov here?  DFW is a near-genius in the sense of near-beer.  Still, in this young millennium, even near-beer is good enough for four stars.
B000024P3A|4.0|Since most of the reviews here seemed to be about the second, more blues-oriented half of this album, I decided to put my two cents in on the first, more Bo Diddley-beat side.  If \\"tight\\" is what you're after, this is most definitely not for you.  If you want a cool snapshot of two guitar icons at their respective primes, grab this disc.  I had a copy of \\"Two Great Guitars\\" back from when it was available on Chess all by itself, and I played it all the time, especially at parties.  It also makes for interesting mix tape/mp3/cd contributions, including a really cool (no kidding) version of \\"When The Saints Go Marching In.\\"  Something interesting to think about as you listen is exactly how loose and jammy the playing really is, not the contrived BS of current-day so-called \\"jam bands\\" and other misbegotten lovechildren of the truly wonderful Grateful Dead.  The situation that led to this album was a contrivance on the part of the Chess brothers to try to parlay the success of two of their biggest artists into an easy commercial success.  Despite that, \\"Two Great Guitars\\" is fun, spontaneous and full of personality.
B0000024UF|4.0|Leonard Cohen's 1969 album \\"Songs From a Room\\" kind of picks up where his debut \\"Songs of Leonard Cohen\\" left off, offering another dose of Cohen's mysteriously poetic lyrics, his precise and carefully considered acoustic guitar parts, & his and warm and earnestly expressive vocals.  Oh, and the album-closing whistling.    What's different about it?  Well, John Simon, producer and musical director of the debut, is gone, and the producer this time is Bob Johnston, legendary for having previously produced Bob Dylan.  Although \\"Songs of...\\" is overall quite spare, \\"...Room\\" is even more so.   When that fuzzy electric guitar on \\"A Bunch of Lonsome Heroes\\" makes its first appearance, the effect is jolting, as if its been beamed in from another planet; it's also the only track on the album to prominently feature drums.  Other embellishments include the string arrangement on \\"Bird on the Wire\\" and the female vocals on \\"The Partisan\\", the latter of which is partly sung in English and partly in French and is also the only song here that Cohen didn't write.  A Jew's harp, of all things, adds its boing-y sound which runs pratically non-stop throughout nearly every song on the album.  It generally manages to not be too prominent or distracting, and somehow it even works well when it IS mixed prominently on \\"The Old Revolution\\", but it comes across as an eyeroll-inducing gimmick on \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\".  There's also excellent atmospheric organ work lingering in the background on \\"Story of Isaac\\" and \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\".    Ironically, the weakest song here is the relatively famous \\"Bird on the Wire\\" where Cohen actually sounds like he's dumbing things down a bit in attempt to get a hit song--it's rather dull, and it's weighed down by the syrupy string arrangement and Cohen's strained melodramatic vocals.    But overall, his songwriting is strong, with his sorely underrated talent for melody being very much in evidence.  \\"Seems So Long Ago, Nancy\\" is something of a eulogy--it's a terrific song that's supremely haunting, yet calmly reflective and strangely uplifting.  Also terrific are the creepy \\"Story of Isaac\\", which draws parallels between the Vietnam War and religion; and \\"Lady Midnight\\", an upbeat-yet-mysterious tune along the lines of the first album's \\"So Long, Marianne\\".  The weirdly upbeat album closer \\"Tonight Will Be Fine\\" has an irresistibly fun sing-songy melody, and it's also quite amusing, especially Cohen's little laugh just before and leading into the 3rd verse.      So, there are some gripes with \\"Songs From a Room\\", but it's a must-have for any Cohen fan--it's an effective mood piece and an engaging collection of songs from this incredibly unique artist.
B000B0QOJA|4.0|I really like this release.  I don't have the old bootlegs so maybe my main gripe would be different if had those to compare to.  The thing is that while this is interesting to listen to and very enjoyable, there are very frequent dropouts in the sound.  If I were involved in this project I wouldn't have dissed the bootlegs by calling them \\"inferior-quality\\" as the cover does.  Similarly, it says \\"these remarkable performances can at last be heard with the fidelity they deserve\\".  The dynamic range and clarity is, in fact, very good.  It's just those dang drop outs drive me nuts while I listen.<br /><br />The price seems a bit steep too, but again, I like the product hence the 4 star rating.
B000AJJNPY|5.0|This is by far their most impressive album. Every song creates a swell of emotion within the listener, most tracks so beautiful that they spawn tears and take one's breath away. This is a must have for anyone that appreciates Sigur Ros's unique style of music.
B000068QVN|5.0|It was late 1969. I was a freshman in high school, and a certifiable rock'n'roll nut. A friend who lived across the street dragged a \\"portable\\" eight-track tape machine (it looked like suitcase and weighed 3-tons) to my house, jammed in a new cartridge (On Time) by a band I'd never heard of called Grand Funk Railroad, and said, \\"You gotta hear this...\\" <br />  <br />I admired the great rock icons of the 1960's, but to most of the people my age, the Olympians of rock's second movement were not our peers. The Beatles, the Stones, Bob Dylan, et.al. made great music, music we younger boomers understood and enjoyed, but those people had long since dedicated themselves to playing primarily for our older brothers and sisters-not to us.  <br /> <br />The Olympian Rockers were too serious. They had mythologies to live up to, or down to. Often they were not that much fun. They rarely-to-never toured, so we never saw them. Worse, they'd mostly gotten to the place where you couldn't dance to their music, you were supposed to just sit and listen to it. That was very bad, because when you're fourteen, dancing matters.  <br /> <br />The older boomers (born between 1945 and 1954) despised the younger half of the generation  (born 1955 through 1964) in that special way older siblings always hate their juniors. When the so-called \\"youth press\\" was not actively hostile to the second wave of the boom they were at least patronizing toward it. They dubbed us \\"teeny-boppers\\" and \\"microboomers,\\" and published articles praising the music of boring aged drug burnouts-often guys who were actually 29 or even older. If those magazines wrote about microboomer bands at all, they always slagged them mercilessly. We used to speculate that the \\"youth press\\" was born old.  <br /> <br />So, when my friend popped that eight-track of On Time into that refrigerator-sized \\"micro\\" stereo, I heard three young guys playing music that made sense to me. It was great! It was simple three-chord rock'n'roll, veryheavy on the bass and drums that featured a pounding, hammering, sweaty rhythm that a dead warthog could dance to. It was like an epiphany.  <br /> <br />I've often heard older boomers talk about the first time they heard the Beatles' \\"Sergeant Pepper.\\" The tale is told with the eye moist and the sound of senile rapture in the voice. It generally involves the term \\"revelatory\\" to describe the Beatles' greatest album. In 1969, I'd heard Pepper and I liked it a lot, but it was so very civilized and so self-consciously \\"artsy.\\" The powerful, savage music made by Grand Funk Railroad was apparently the work of Neanderthals from the barely-civilized jungles of Flint, Michigan, located somewhere in an exotic place called \\"the rust belt\\" and it was way closer to \\"revelatory\\" for me and most of my peers.   <br /> <br />But Grand Funk really were my peers. They were horney, angry, hungry for success, and played rock and roll like it mattered. News flash: it does. <br /> <br />Grand Funk made songs you could sing to your girlfriend, they made songs you could actually learn if you played guitar. Most importantly, they made music you could dance to. They were great. <br /> <br />This album catches the boys at what had to be the high point of their touring career: the original three musicians performing the core songs that made them great. Dig this album. Embrace this record. It's the stuff. You gotta hear this...
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Short review- the series is everything you've heard about.  Most likely if you are looking to buy it, you've heard about it from someone, and they were right.  For those who don't know- it's got all the aspects you are looking for- comedic and dramatic wrapped up in a futuristic frontier. The character's are well written and you'll find yourself hooked.
B0007OY2P8|1.0|Poor Jane Austen.  It's a pity that no one tossed a dose of dramamine into her casket to help assuage the pitching, rolling and spinning she would have to endure over this rubbish.    Shame on the BBC (and the Arts & Entertainment Network) for palming off this dog of a production onto the world.  Let's start with the first offender ... the screenwriter, Maggie Wadey.  I'll give her the benefit of the doubt and say she actually read the novel, but I dare say she did not understand it.  She single handedly turned it into what Jane Austin was satirizing ... the Gothic novel!  This isn't Wadey's first offense either ... she has butchered more than her fair share of classic novels by consistently trying to re-invent the \\"concept\\" of the wheel, so why the BBC kept her telephone number in their rolodex is a mystery.      But to be fair, she doesn't get ALL the blame.  The direction and production values also receive dreadful marks.  Hammy acting, over the top costumes, and terrible pacing render this too painful to watch.  Whatever they spent making this lavish flop could have been put to better use, such as donating all the money to a homeless shelter or soup kitchen.    If you REALLY want to see Jane Austen works that were treated with sensitivity and respect, then you're far better off watching Emma Thompson's awe-inspiring \\"Sense and Sensibility\\" or, pick up the outstanding 1995 version of \\"Pride and Prejudice\\" ... even \\"Emma\\" with Gwyneth Paltrow's pseudo-British accent is better than this drivel.    Don't waste your money ... or your time.
B00000GAIW|5.0|THIS CD IS WHAT I PLAY ON MY WAY TO THE OFFICE EACH AND EVERY MORNING. NEED I SAY MORE?
0393317552|4.0|I read this book when it first came out.  I'm very interested in pre-history and the relationship with the evolution of man and the environment, and a fan or former Diamond books.  I read it and I liked it.  It is well done.   <br /> <br />Why am I reviewing it now?  Because more and more as I read magazine articles, histories, discussions of global warming and avian flu, Diamond's book and the theoretical framework he develops is referenced. <br /> <br />Diamond's thesis is that the wide trends of human history were heavily influenced (determined is too strong a word) by geographic and environmental factors.  He draws on the theory of Island Biogeography (read Song of the Dodo for a great popular account) to say that people on the large Eurasian landmass had intrinsic advantages over those on the other continents, including exposure to germs that strengthened their immune systems, lots of domesticable plants and animals etc. <br /> <br />Not everyone agrees with this analysis, but everyone is having to react to it.   <br /> <br />The obvious criticisms of the theory are that it is applying a backwards pattern on historical expediency and deriving inevitability.  It also has been seen by a few as yet another attempt to justify the unique position of Europeans and their descendents in the world...with all the possible related racism thereby \\"excused\\".  I believe Diamond escapes these traps through good exposition, even-handedness and sensitivity.   <br /> <br />4.5 stars.
B00006JLX4|5.0|I once started an entire webpage devoted to pointing out how Slanted & Enchanted is STILL better than your own personal favorite indie-rock album.  Now that it's been reissued in one of the most fantastic \\"deluxe\\" packages ever devoted to an individual album (ALL the bonus material is worth it, the B-sides are top-shelf material, the Watery, Domestic EP contains two of the group's all-time greats in \\"Frontwards\\" and \\"Shoot The Singer,\\" the BBC sessions are nearly as essential, \\"Greenlander\\" is the group's great lost track, and the concert catches a notoriously hit-or-miss live group at their best), it's worth reconsidering why this album is so fantastic, and why it managed to win me over when I'm the sort of music-lover least inclined to enjoy stuff like this.    You have to understand, I came to this album from the point of view of an arch-skeptic. My friend told me to buy this when I was still in my hardcore \\"nothing from beyond 1980 is worth hearing\\" phase as a freshman in college. And honestly, when I first put it on, I thought someone had played a cruel joke on me. Awful production, distortion and guitar noise everywhere (like somebody was jabbing a screwdriver into my ears! Gaaah!), a singer who couldn't (or wouldn't) sing, jagged chord changes and some gratingly strange lyrics (\\"What is this 'I'M TRYING! I'M TRYING!' tosh?\\")  After a few grudging, half-attentive listens, I put it aside thinking that so-called \\"indie\\" music just probably wasn't for me.    Ah what a fool.    Several years later I came back to this album a changed man.  My musical boundaries had broken out of their original '60s ghetto during the intervening period, and when I went back to Slanted & Enchanted and had one of those epiphanies that are so rare and so prized with rock music. What had been inscrutable before just jumped out at me now: brilliant songs with quirky, wonkish lyrics, and oh-so-melodic vocal lines running throughout nearly every one. I'm a bigot for melody, and the lo-fi production (which I still consider to be a needlessly self-inflicted wound) disguises some of the best melodies and most well-written songs of the era: \\"Trigger Cut\\" would have been a pop-rock smash in any just universe, a double A-side along with \\"Here.\\" \\"In The Mouth A Desert,\\" \\"Zurich Is Stained,\\" \\"Summer Babe,\\" \\"Loretta's Scars,\\" \\"Two States\\" (which seems to me to be a total ripoff of Paul McCartney & Wings' \\"Helen Wheels,\\" I might point out): these songs displayed a craft in their construction that pointedly belied the tinny production and indifferent, almost apathetic image the band sought to project.      The more experimental and abrasive material also works too; \\"No Life Singed Her,\\" crazy shouting and all, actually has a hardcore riff that provides a solid backbone for the piece, and the (clearly Fall-indebted) screams of \\"I'M TRYING!\\" in \\"Conduit For Sale!\\" end up being one of the album's most memorable moments. (How many times I've found myself muttering that line that under my breath...)    Even today, after years of further exposure to newer and weirder stuff, \\"Trigger Cut\\" is STILL the catchiest freakin' pop-hit-that-never was, with holy grail chord-changes, clever guitar layering by Spiral Stairs, and an ensemble performance that flies and swoops more than it has any right to do given the fact that a.) the bandmembers lived in four different states, b.) they rarely played together, c.) the drummer was a Sixties acid casualty. I STILL put \\"Here\\" on all of my mix CDs, and \\"Conduit For Sale!\\" STILL out-Falls the Fall (without even really TRYING....TRYING...TRYING...TRYING).     The seeming randomness of Stephen Malkmus' lyrics STILL disguises a pathos and resignation that his voice conveys equally adeptly: with the echt-ennui of a Gen X clown, he snarks to keep from crying.  Malkmus' voice originally annoyed me intensely, as I automatically associated it with a raft of lazy '90s slacker-toned lead singers who plagued the airwaves under the guise of \\"alternative\\" music.  But the difference between Pavement and those other late, unlamented groups isn't just the brilliant higher-order songwriting or Malkmus' natural melodic knack. (Look, man: \\"Zurich Is Stained.\\"  That sort of crazy inspired melody - both new AND catchy - only comes along once in awhile.) It's also found in the way Malkmus manages to sound at once flippant and sincere while singing lyrics that, for the most part, seem calculated to confuse.  \\"Here\\" is an obvious exception, but the strange, practiced inflections of \\"Trigger Cut\\" do an even more impressive job of creating emotional coherence out of words that ought not to make any literal sense.    Yup, it's still better than your favorite indie-rock album.  Unless Slanted & Enchanted happens to be your favorite indie-rock album already, of course. In which case you, my friend, have your priorities straight.
B00003CXUM|5.0|A user before me has warn you not to watch the deleted scenes. Lucky of you, nobody told me that on time.  <br /> <br />This is a beautiful movie by any standard: the colors, the mood, the story, the acting, the soundtrack -at the same level of the one in Kieslowski's Three Colors: Red-. Image is sharp and the sound is clear. <br /> <br />It tells the story of an impossible love. It is not impossible because of the circumstances, but because the characters have decided to deny their feelings. They are married to other people, but they love each other. Their couples are being unfaithful to them, but they don't want to do the same thing. <br /> <br />Every time they try to talk about their feelings the camera shows them as if they were at jail, behind bars (usually the bars from a window). That's what's happening to them: they are trapped because they have decided to. Of course, the bars are not really there, they're free to do whatever they want to, but they have to prove that they're different, that it is possible to defeat temptation. <br /> <br />The DVD comes in two discs: disc one is the movie itself, disc two comes with a lot of extras. All the extras are worthy... except the deleted scenes. All the charm and the sadness of the story in disc one is destroyed by these scenes that should've never been filmed. This is one of the best examples of the importance of editing the story, as the movie gained a lot of points by delivering something very different and shorter than the original idea. Buy it, you won't regret it.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|SHE MAY BE DEPRESSED AND ANGRY BUT SHE SINGS STRAIGHT FROM THE GUT... ISN'T THAT WHAT IT'S ALL ABOUT? I BOUGHT TWO COPIES OF THIS CD.
B00003JRCQ|5.0|Other reviewers seem to see this film only as a cosy, romantic piece of escapism. I can't help but feeling that they are missing something. <br /> <br />This is a slow and beautiful film, which, in spite of its happy ending, has a gentle sorrow to it. Time is passing by for Anne Elliot - she's older than any other Austen heroine, and this sense of lost youth is very present in the film. <br /> <br />This is also one of the few films I have seen that actually captures the feeling of being in love. Anne sees Captain Wentworth passing in the street or is helped by him into a carriage - these are the small moments that can be described for a page or two in the books. Modern films tend to want more drama, but this adaptation sticks to the \\"small canvas\\" that Jane Austen worked with, and does so brilliantly. <br /> <br />Nothing is harder than making nice people interesting, but in this Persuasion really is a success. Amanda Root plays Anne with a lot of warmth and intelligence, and Ciaran Hinds as Captain Wentworth is also very likeable.  <br /> <br />Watching this film left me with a little bit melancholic, but also uplifted. It seems to describes so accurately how it feels to be alive, to love and long, with both humour and wistfulness. It's more than just escapism, and deserves better attention than playing in the background as you hover your flat. <br />
B00004XONN|5.0|In a sentence: it's the best album by the greatest group working in rock music today. The glacial overlay (credit Protools and Thom Yorke's disaffection with his muse in equal measure) hides the fire underneath, and as in the best collaborative music-making, this tension creates a masterpiece. From the dissociative song deconstruction of \\"In Limbo\\" (a normal rock song whose component parts have all come untethered and are bobbing away from each other like buoys on an angry sea) and the melt-away-the-pain strings of \\"How To Disappear Completely\\" to the increasingly fevered amnesiac dreams of \\"Morning Bell\\" or the spastic twitch of \\"Idioteque,\\" Kid A travels a yawningly vast musical and emotional range without ever having to raise its voice to get your attention. Proof that electrifying music doesn't require you to turn your amps up to 11.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|The Grapes of wrath movie was excellent, and was a great rendition of the book. Unfortunately, it left out some parts from the book. Because it was a movie, it would have been difficult to represent the \\"Metaphor\\" chapters, which are every other chapter in the book. Each metaphor chapter is basically explaining what the Joads will experience next, from a different point of view. It also cuts some things short, like grandpa's death. In the movie, grandpa dies suddenly, only a little while after the family starts going west. In the book, the family is very close to the CA border and his death is longer, and more drawn out. Also, Steinbeck writes that \\"He never really left Oklahoma\\", which was one of the reasons Grandpa died. The movie also leaves out how the Joads leave their dog with Muley because there just isn't enough room. Also, in the book, Casy gets killed and Tom goes into hiding at the end of the story. In the movie, this happens a little more than halfway through the movie. After this happens, the family moves to the Government camp, which has dances and running water. After this, the movie ends abruptly, not really tying the story in at the end, whereas in the book, the family moves to pick cotton. The story ends with the family caught in a storm and trying to find higher ground before the boxcar they live in floods completely. <br />One of the most important parts the movie leaves out, is Rose of Sharon's baby, which dies at birth. I think that this is too important to leave out, but the movie ends before Rose of Sharon gives birth. <br />    Over all, I enjoyed the book better, and hope people will read the book before they watch this movie.
0859652777|5.0|What is the first thing that comes to your head when you hear the name Marilyn Manson? To some people, Marilyn Manson is the man who is against God and is a big sinner. To others he is the crazy man who wears make-up and dresses funny. But for his fans, he is the rocker that symbolizes the God of the Gothic World and who is bigger than Satan himself. But, truly who is Marilyn Manson? Why and how did he become this particular performer? In his own words, Brian Hugh Warner, also known as Marilyn Manson, tells how he was brainwashed and went throught hell in his grandparents home. He explains how Marilyn Manson and the Spooky Kids were formed in 1989. How he went to college and became a journalist who interviewed Debbie Harry, Malcolm McLaren and the Red Hot Chili Peppers and other metal performers. He even publised an article on Trent Razor of Nine Inch Nails. I personally really enjoyed this book. Not only does he show how depressed he was in his early years, but he puts this sense of humor into it. He also proves how really smart he is and that everything that rumors say is not true. I recommend this book to anyone because it's positive to answer almost evrey question you might have in mind about Marilyn Manson <br />
B0009WFFS6|4.0|Before buying this DVD you need to understand the following points: <br /> <br />Overall, it was a good show and as good as you could expect given its limitations.  If you don't go in starstruck and expecting them to live up to their former glory, you won't be disappointed. They are more mature musicians and better players, but that maturity has replaced that youthful energy.   <br /> <br />Go in with the idea that they did the best they could do NOW, although of course this would have been MUCH better had they done it twenty years ago! Then again, one would guess that the specter of mortality and the idea that they're not getting any younger probably drove the reunion in large part.  <br /> <br />1) The guys are in their Sixties and not their twenties.  Jack and Ginger especially look long in the tooth.   <br /> <br />2)They use current gear, not vintage gear. This means the overall sound is cleaner and less ferocious than the old band. Jack uses SWR amps, although the trusty EB-1 makes an appearance.  Eric uses Fender amps and guitars... no Marshall stacks, no SG's. <br /> <br />3) As the guys are quick to point out in the interview segments, they are \\"Cream the way we play now, not the way we played then.\\"  The fire and youthful joy with which they played in the old days are replaced by tastefullness and precision. Eric especially sees no need to shoehorn as many notes as possible into each measure. <br /> <br />4) They do a competent job playing the Cream repetioire, although there are few extended jams and no surprise covers.   <br /> <br />5) At least they documented the concert in its entirety this time.  Although I am mad they didn't do \\"SWLABR\\" and \\"Tales of Brave Ulysses.\\" <br />
B000000W5L|5.0|Exile On Main Street is seriously in danger of drowning in its own mythology. \\"Don't you see? The Rolling Stones were *themselves* exiles on main street, forced to live away from their homes and in exile from their muse!\\" Give me a break. They were junkie rockstar tax fugitives holed up the south of France drinking whiskey straight from the bottle and banging groupies 'til their you-know-whats fell off. (Don't take my word for it - it's all there in the liner photos!)     Of course they ALSO happened to be the greatest rock and roll band in the world at the time, and this effortless double-album, covering every single relevant rootsy musical genre from country to blues to gospel to rock to weird hoodoo jungle-grooves that probably didn't even have a proper name, is the ultimate proof. There's precisely one song (\\"Casino Boogie\\") that's less than utterly necessary to the conceit at hand, but everything else holds together, the smaller more mysterious songs like \\"I Just Want To See His Face\\" and \\"Sweet Black Angel\\" being the necessary glue holding together the monster star turns like \\"Tumbling Dice,\\" \\"Happy\\" (in truth, Keith Richards sings pretty good for a guy who sounds like he's constantly falling off of a cliff), \\"Let It Loose,\\" and \\"All Down The Line.\\" They manage to put this stuff across so sincerely and convincingly that they almost make you forget the fact that \\"Soul Survivor\\" is actually all about - arrrr, matey! - life as a pirate sailing the high seas.    I kid you not. Really, it is. Check the lyrics.
B0009X7664|5.0|Now my cinematc life is complete (or so I'd like to think).  I have the ultimate editions of 'The Godafather', 'Citizen Kane', 'Lord of the Rings Trilogy' and 'Lawrence of Arabia'.  Much has been said in these forums of the merits of this great film, 'To Kill a Mockingbird', which I will not repeat but I can state that the DVD is viusally and sonically flawless; clearly a new direct digital transfer was made and the sound was considerably improved.  The commentaries are expert and the features informative.  What more can one say about excellence?
0671027344|4.0|The Perks of Being a Wallflower is a great read for any class throughout the U.S. One of the more interesting novels available to young-adult readers, Chbosky does a fantastic job of telling an authentic version of the drama filled life of a teenager. He, unlike many authors, chooses to write about the unmentionable yet realistic things in every teenager's life. <br /> <br /> The book is about a boy named Charlie, a fifteen year old who is mentally unstable, experiencing both the highs and lows of life and not being able to control his emotions. Having recently lost two loved ones, he begins writing letters to an unknown friend explaining his life candidly. Charlie mentions many things including love, friendship, heartbreak, sexuality, drugs, family issues, shame and many other experiences. With the encouragement of a teacher he begins to \\"participate\\" in life and figure out who \\"Charlie\\" really is. Suddenly, a secret he didn't even know he was hiding is revealed and life as he knows it is turned upside down. While his loved ones are filled with anger, he manages to figure out that everything happens for a reason and is still grateful for going through all the memorable things he has. <br /> <br /> Cut by Patricia Mccormick is another book readers may want to pick up if they liked this fiction. Along the same lines, it deals with a teen in trouble going through tough times and trying to figure out who she is.  <br />
B000ASATWQ|5.0|Jamrock, is by far one of the best -- if not the best -- CD out this year. From track 1 to the end it's hot. If you don't have this CD you are missing out. He has songs with just about everyone you can think of on the CD. You have your classic Jah love songs, dance music and social conscience tracks. Something for everyone is on this CD.
0446613444|2.0|I was a big fan of Connelly after 2 other books (out of order) and was concerned when Black Ice fell flat for me.  However, I think it really was soph. slump and Connelly has recovered nicely.  It was tedious whereas his others are detailed and I decided one night I wasn't curious about anything and reading the rest felt like a chore.  And that is a rare statment for me: I am the one everyone makes fun of for reading so much and for needing reading like breathing. <br />Skip this and go to other Connellys, especially The Narrows.
B000B9EY2U|4.0|Coming off their trademark interminable wait and the underwhelming \\"Ultra\\" and \\"Exciter\\",  Depeche Mode's latest offering sidles, slips and smashes its way back into familiar territory. <br /> <br />At first listen, it's both brash and engaging; Accessible enough to draw you in, but challenging to the point of requiring repeated listenings to grasp. A beautiful and bittersweet return to form!
6305358613|2.0|This film is beautifully produced, and Blanchett's performance--as well as those of other major cast members--is fine.  However, the lack of historical accuracy in the film made it hard for me to watch--especially after having seen the brilliant Glenda Jackson mini-series.  Surely there is more than enough accurate historical material on Elizabth I's life and times to obviate the need for so much invention or omission.
B0006A9FKA|1.0|A completely horrible and boring movie. I guess I'm supposed <br />to laugh because it's made by brits. Afterall, if you don't <br />find their attempts at drawing cheaps laughs funny it's because <br />you don't have any humor or culture. <br /> <br />Modern PC america at it's worst.
B0000AQVCL|2.0|There's nothing wrong with interpreting sounds from other bands, if you do it well. Oasis did it pretty well with their first two albums (the rest or their albums are another story). But most of the songs on here just aren't that inspired. There are a few good ones though - I like \\"Cold Hard Bitch\\" the most. This album just isn't worth buying though. I'm not sure why there was so much public attention given to this album. <br /> <br />I'm even more baffled why they chose \\"Look What You've Done\\" as their second single. That song is too simple and sappy, just like the Beatles \\"Let It Be.\\"  Just like that song, the chord progression is too simple and it's too simple and sappy, like a children's song.  I've read that \\"Look What You've Done\\" is actually more like the Beatle's \\"Sexy Sadie,\\" but that song title does not ring a bell with me and I'm not sure I know it. <br /> <br />Save your money. If you must, request it from the library like I did or borrow it from a friend. Regionally, there should be many copies of this album on the shelves. <br />
B000B2YQX4|3.0|First, I am a fan.  Unlike many fans, I think Ultra and Exciter are very good.  Not SOFD or Violator great, but definitely good.  Exciter has some of DMs very best songs.  I think this album is blah.  First, as others have mentioned, the Martin songs are atrocious and borderline unbearable -  which is a big surprise.  Second, while Precious is a great song, nothing else sounds even remotely like it.  Its the star, but why they decided to only record one song in this style and the rest in screaming or talking we will never know.  Lyrics are generally not up to par.    <br /> <br />There are a few songs here that will make it into iTunes playlists, but I think even more will be on a very long slow rotation of obscurity.  Sadly, this album is still probably better than half the drek being released.
B000B5XOSO|4.0|The problem with sequels is that unless you are telling the second part of a single story (e.g., 'Attack of the Clones', 'Godfather II', or 'Matrix Reloaded'), the script for the sequel just is NOT going to be as compelling.  In this case, the writers try to compensate by having TWO villians - Penguin (Danny DeVito) and Catwoman (Michelle Pfeifer). <br /> <br />However, director Tim Burton did as good a job as you can by keeping the original noir/creepy/comic book feel of Gotham while adding a new element of atmosphere (the whole story takes place in a snowy winter). The casting is just as good as the original, if not better.  I cannot possibly picture a better Catwoman or Penguin, and Christopher Walken is just as good as the sub-villian as Jack Palance was in the original.  The scene where Batman removes his mask for a dying Catwoman has a degree of poignancy in the final scene of this film that matches the suspense of the final scene in the original film. <br /> <br />Overall, this is a worthy successor to the original.  <br /> <br />
0307276902|1.0|So because he chose not to use his brain or accept personal responsibility for his behavior - it's everyone's fault but his - we offer im glory in this book? We've become a sad society. What is worse is that so many others are following in those same footsteps without accepting their own choices as the cause of their hard life. Boo-hoo....sorry, found it totally unsavory.
B000B5XOXY|2.0|The bottom line is that this is where the franchise, built legitmately with Tim Burton's creepy/comic atmosphere and the unlikely/perfect casting of Michael Keeton in 'Batman' (1988) and 'Batman Returns' (1992), took a complete nosedive. <br /> <br />The first sign of problems is the utter incohence of the casting.  Neither of the actors playing title character nor Harvey Dent wanted a part of this. <br /> <br />The only redeeming aspect of this film is the introduction of Robin.  And that is what makes it one star above 'Batman & Robin' (otherwise known as 'Batman on Ice'). <br /> <br />The primary problem is style.  Let me put it this way - I SHOULD not really be able to guess Joel Schumacher's sexual preference by simply watching his Batman films.  It really would have had more legitimacy if he had just taken the film and made a musical out of it.
B0006L16N8|5.0|Wow, this is one of those CDs you rip and just let run over and over again on your MP3 player.  Almost makes you forget how good rush of blood to the head is.. almost.
B000B0QOJA|2.0|I happened to be at the Half Note  on many nights during this run, although not on these nights, if I remember.  I though that Trane was battling the rest of the band and the rest of the band didn't want to do this anymore. It sounded overwrought. I had the bootlegs and I thought this release would have better sound.  It doesn't.  Save your money. Other than the 'historical' aspect, this is no big deal.
B000929AJQ|2.0|I listened to this album several times through when it first came out and have not had the urge to pick it up again since. I think the best way to sum it up is that it sounds like someone is parodying NIN, but in a lighearted way. There's no more darkness, no ethereal rhythyms, no emotional lyrics. To me, it's all just plain boring. I was a big fan of Downward Spiral and most of Fragile. This one has none of the merits of those two releases.  I understand that Trent was trying to get away from his old sound, but this album is definately not an evolution. If you put NIN albums in a line of musical progression, I'd say this one would come right after Pretty Hate Machine.      ********I take it all back!!! I have recently picked this CD up again and wonder what I was thinking! This thing is great! I still hate \\"Only\\" and think it is still an attempt at \\"radio friendly\\" but every other song is a masterpiece. Maybe it's because I watched \\"In Time Beside You\\" and am just more enthusiastic about each song now, but I've definately changed my opinion. I'd rank this one with Year Zero, which is another one of my new favorites.***********
B0006B2A42|4.0|This is a good cold war drama. After a Soviet spy satellite comes down in the wrong place, the race is on to recapture the film. As was pointed out in the film, the Soviets used their German scientists to launch the satellite containing the camera stolen from England's German scientists using a special film developed by the US's German scientists. The film has the location of both side's missile installations and both sides want it. Neither side will give an inch.<br /><br />The chase takes place with a US nuclear sub, overcrowded by marines and spies. The problem is that there is a double agent on board who will give up his own life to sabotage the mission. The twists and turns don't stop and neither does the excitement. The film is dated but still a good show. The photography especially is spectacular, especially for that day and age.<br /><br />Rock Hudson leads an all star cast which does a great job across the board.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|One of the best sci-fi shows to come out in years and a shame that it all had to end so soon. If you consider yourself a fan of sci-fi, this is a no brainer for at least a rental or even a purchase. Please check it out!!
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I watched this with a few friends of mine and it was pure perfection. Lifelike CG, some of the movie looked like a real person! A little confusing in the plot line but the images are worth the money!
B000002BMV|5.0|This is Journey in their prime. it doesn't get any better that this.<br /><br />1. Don't Stop Believin'- Probably their best known song. A great rocker.<br />2. Stone in Love - My all-time favorite Journey song. An underrated rock 'n' roll classic.<br />3. Who's Cryin' Now - Neal Schon's bluesy soulful Gibson sings with feeling the whole way through.<br />4. Keep on Runnin' - People don't think of this song when they think of Journey. A loud and fast one, I LOVE IT!!! (Extra points for the XC runner like me)<br />5. Still They Ride - It's alright. Of all their songs that were popular back before I was born, this is one of the weaker ones.<br />6. Escape - A great plethora of musical variety. A good jam, especially live.<br />7. Lay it Down - Simple song, yet still rocks out. Steve Perry shows his aggressive?, testosterone driven? side...<br />8. Dead or Alive - A run of the mill song where Neal Schon's blazing guitar is the only strong point.<br />9. Mother, Father - A moving song written by Schon and his sister? wife?... not sure, but it's a good one.<br />10. Open Arms - The perfect closer to the album. A timeless, if not the best, power ballad.<br /><br />p.s. --- John Cain was the guy who really brought this whole album together to make it as popular as it was. Greg Rolie (the former keyboarder) had more of a jam feel to his songwriting/playing. Cain was the one who made the general public (or at least some of the general public) love Journey.<br /><br />peace out
B00005JNTX|5.0|There's a reason that ticket sales are down some 30%. Hollywood producers haven't caught on that moviegoers are not pawns who will run out and see every Ashton Kutcher formulic comedy or some forgettable horror film. As a college student I can safely say this is the biggest cult movie to come around since Fight Club. Cinematically gorgeous in a way that a 200 million dollar Lucas epic could never imagine. Maverick acting by Rourke and Willis, who apparently refuse to become washed up. Perfectly directed and \\"chopped\\"- there is never a dull scene. Overall, a five star film that through all of the excess manages to evoke real human feeling. Granted, it wont cross generational lines for obvious reasons, however, for the college kids of America, this is high art. Kudos Rodriguez, I forgive you for the Spy Kids trilogy.
0805079076|4.0|Deutscher's book is an excellent introduction to a fascinating topic: the ways in which language has evolved over thousands of years through processes like erosion, accretion and analogy.  His explanations of phenomena like the Latin case system, French verb endings, and Semitic verbal templates are excellent--though marred, as other reviewers have noted, by the author's often annoying sense of his own cleverness.  Other reviewers have also noted that, because of the author's British education, many of his examples come from British English.  This, combined with his sense of his own cleverness, unfortunately yields an obsession with the British verb \\"to snog\\" which (when used to illustrate the complexities of the Semitic verb) grew a little tiresome.  But despite the author's idiosyncracies, I recommend this book.  Although Deutscher may draw too much attention to himself, he also succeeds admirably in drawing attention to the processes by which the remarkable architecture of language is created, destroyed, and built up again from the broken pieces.
0767834739|1.0|How this has a 3.5 star average is beyond me. My room mate told me this was the \\"best film he had ever seen.\\" Mind you, he is also a fan of Lizzy McGuire, so I took this recommendation with weary cynicism. Nonetheless, after a family party and a few too many Corona's, my brother and I reluctantly rented this glutton of a film.  <br /> <br />Now, I do believe in the \\"so bad its good\\" aesthetic. Some movies like \\"XXX\\" are so bad they are good. This however, is so bad its painful. When the dumbest looking monster I have ever seen shows up on screen bound to a rocket launcher I was embarassed to be watching this movie. The acting is so poor it makes Paul Walker's thespian skills comprable to Sir Ben Kingsley's. There are so many explosions the action scenes lose meanings. All of the actors should be banned from the screen actors guild. The studio responsible should be shut down. This movie not only reflects pooly on cinema, but on the movie going audience as a whole. <br /> <br />Needless to say I have ex-communicated the person recommended it to me. Do yourself a favor, skip this movie, rent Ernest Scared Stupid, and sleep well knowing that you watched a FAR superior film.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I dont see the big hype about this album. Ive been a Depeche Mode fan since Music for the Masses and I have to say that since Violator, its been pretty much the same dark music. I have to admit that I keep an open mind that they will produce something that I can listen to over and over. The loss of Alan Wilder was huge, he was the one that would put a melody to the music so that all you have to do is play a few notes and you would know instantly what song it is. You can do that with the last few albums let a lone songs.  <br /> <br />Plus the sounds sound \\"dirty\\" the songs sounds like they were put thru an overamped synthisizer and over done. I agree with earlier reviews that Davids Voice sounds great, but I dont like it when it to has been but thru a shredder or sounds like hes singing into a phone. <br /> <br />Track #1 is by far the best in my eyes, it has a good beat and a good riff and melody. Precious is a good song also, but I could see A Pain that Im Used To being the opening song to the concert as Dead of Night was to the Exciter Tour. <br /> <br />I just hope that this concert doesnt put me to sleep in the middle as Exciter did. I swear they played 4 straight slow songs  and just sucked the energy out of the crowd. Admit it, if you went to the Exciter Tour, the first 4 songs were good and then it got pretty boring after that until Enjoy the Silence started. <br /> <br />I will keep an open mind while I listen to the album more, but as of now. It sounds pretty much the same. No melody, dirty sounding, but the actual remixing was very well done. A feast for the speakers and ears. But not one for you to dance to.
0679777377|5.0|If you did like the movie based on this book, you'll most probably like it. As usual, the book is better than the movie, in this case not just because it goes into detail but because of Ondaatje's style of writing. Most of the people I've given this book to read said they sometimes had to give it away for a minute just to take a new breath. It really makes yoy stop and enjoy the stong effect it has on you and wonder how someone can put the words in an order with such an effect. A beautiful story beautifully written which is a rare combination.     <br />To make this short, if you did like Alessandro Baricco's SILK (which is my most favourite book), you'll probably like this one too and vice versa. This book is a must for all people who don't mind reading lovestories but find most of them trivial and banal. This is a book about love - strong and rare, forbidden and scathing, a life-and-death love many of us wish to find. Enjoy.
B0002SROT0|3.0|To start off and vent, I'm sick and tired of the Elliott Smith / Nick Drake comparison, so they both died young.  Frankly the two just don't match up to me, Drake is simply out of his league.  Anyways, to the album.  This is a pretty decent album, I unfortunately haven't heard too much of Mr. Smith's previous work which I am told is excellent.  I became acquainted with his stuff shortly after the release of the movie \\"Good Will Hunting\\" and bought that soundtrack.  Quite good.  So with that being said, I had rather high expectations when this album was released although I knew it was still somewhat of a work in progress.  There are some excellent songs on here, my favorites include \\"Fond Farewell to a friend\\" and \\"Get Lost\\", both deeply sad and melodic.  I also enjoyed \\"Pretty Ugly Before\\", however it was aired on \\"The O.C.\\" so that turned me off of it immediately.  I can truly feel Elliott's depression and dependence on drugs on this record.  His guitarwork has always fascinated me with it's sad chord arrangements and complexity.  I'm just personally not into many of the other selections on this disc.  There are some with very heavy distorted guitar which don't connect with the other songs and are just poorly written and unmelodic.  \\"Strung out again\\", perhaps the worst song on the album actually sounds as if he is playing his guitar on in a total incoherent drugged out mess.  Some of the songs are flat out unlistenable.  Overall,for me the very few good songs on this record are good enough to overcome these poor ones which should not have been released.  I recommend this album if you are a fan of Smith and want a first hand account of his depression before he died.  Too bad no more work will ever come from Elliott who definitely has a unique quality that will be missed.

B000B2YQX4|3.0|this Depeche Mode CD is kind of lame!!  Five good tracks, the rest is enough to tame the wildest beast and put it to sleep.  [...]  I have been a faithful Depeche Mode fan since 1984 and this cd is lame.  I gave it two stars just because I am a Mode fan, other than that the music cannot justify the long wait.  If you want a stellar cd get Dave Gahan's solo project, that's the best thing \\"Mode-ish\\" in the last five years!!  I long for the days of Alan Wilder to rejoin Mode.  Here's my take my take on the songs...    1. A Pain That I'm Used To - Best song on the cd!! Imagine I Feel You, Barrel of a Gun, and the Dead of Night merged and made into one song, all the elements and sound are here!    2. Damaged People - This song is, well, is Damaged from the start.  Every time you think the song reaches a climax, it brings you right back down again.  Martin never sounded better, yet the song really goes nowhere.  This song has elements that are very familiar to the Black Celebration album.      3. I Want It All - Same here, but this is not what I want.  Again   another song that is slow and just never goes anywhere.  Some cds have filler songs, you know the songs you skip because they are dull or annoy the crap out of you, and this is it, the fast forward song!!    4. Introspectre - Just an intro sets the mood for the next song.    5. John The Revelator - Depeche Mode meets Marilyn Manson.  The song actually puts some oomph in the CD.  It was a fresh departure from Damage People and I Want It All! This song is going to be an awesome in concert!    6. Lillian - The song is okay.  Think of this as Personal Jesus and Everything Counts mixed together and toned down.    7. Macrovision - Fast forward, you get what I am trying to say, just fast forward.  The song sounds forced!  The middle and breaks in song sounds great.  Yet the song really bores me to death.    8. Nothing's Impossible - Really good song.  This is a great Depeche Mode song. The song that brings back the goose bumps of Depeche Mode Violator days!      9. Precious - Great vibe, great song.  To bad the whole cd is not like this.  This is Mode of 1984, just a cool song.    10. Suffer Well - Wait a minute, its up beat and I can dance to this, heck yeah and that's why it is the second best song on the cd! Again a little Violatorish.  Also has elements of It's No Good to it.    11. The Darkest Star - Uhh, how could give me an up tempo song just to hide back in the cesspool of boredom.    12. The Sinner In Me - I thought this song would pick up, yet it was another song that just keeps going and going never getting anywhere.  The chorus is really good, but it never reaches anything after that!  Again Mode cutting some Manson like vibes.    If you want killer cds from Mode, Black Celebration, Music For The Masses, Violator, Songs of Faith and Devotion, and Ultra.
B0006A9FKA|5.0|this movie is HILARIOUS!! Shaun (an \\"i don't wanna be here\\" electronics salesman) JUGGLES relationships with his disfunctional best friend, his unsatisfied girlfriend, a disgruntled flatmate and brain-eating zombies in a wickedly funny twist on the whole \\"Dawn of the 28 Living Dead Days Later\\" genre with VERY entertaining results. Shaun is a loveably sympathetic character and (best friend) Ed provides endless laughs. there IS a horror flick hiding behind the schtick,...but only BARELY. there is SOME gore (usually presented in a gratuitously humorous manner) but the demeanor of the film is quite light-hearted (and decidedly British)...and i absolutely LOVED IT. it is one of my absolute favorite \\"feel good\\" zombie flicks!! oh,..by the way,....you've got RED on you......
B0001ADAVK|4.0|\\"Mona Lisa Smile\\" follows Katherine Ann Watson (Julia Roberts), a progressive, feminist art teacher as she travels from California to Wellesley in 1953 to accept her dream job as an art history professor. Wellesley is an exclusive girls' school, home to well-bred, wealthy young women whose sole purpose after college (often during) is to get married, have babies, and be the perfect mother and housewife. Katherine is quickly frustrated by the stifling traditional atmosphere.<br /><br />On the first day of class, Katherine is humiliated when all of the students have memorized the art history textbook, quickly making a shambles of her first lesson. Shaken, Katherine calls her boyfriend in tears. The girls are rude, conceited, and have no intent to challenge themselves, which is where Katherine draws the line. Ever the trooper, she marches back to the next class with slides of modern art, making the girls think outside the textbook on the nature of art.<br /><br />The rest of the film follows Katherine as she attempts to fight the Stepford Wives system: the girls spend time learning etiquette, poise, and elocution, place settings, and banter, but mostly hunting future husbands and having lavish weddings. Katherine soon locks horns with Betty (Kirsten Dunst), the most dangerous of the lot. Betty's backstabbing quickly sees to the firing of the school's lesbian nurse for distributing contraceptives, and tries to have Katherine fired as well. She is generally only good at bringing misery to those around her, failing to see her own shortcomings or her husband's infidelities.<br /><br />Katherine soon comes up against the opinions of the other professors, and is pursued by Bill Dunbar, the handsome Italian professor who sleeps with his students. To me, the romance felt forced: Katherine rejects a marriage proposal, and a woman as liberal and feminist as Katherine wouldn't be caught dead with the chauvinistic Bill. The camaraderie of several of the students (Joan, Giselle, and Connie) is shown throughout the year at different campus events, which serves to develop their characters and to see the difference that Katherine makes on their lives (Giselle aspires to be more like Katherine).<br /><br />Katherine soon is introducing \\"dangerous, subversive\\" feminist ideas by using propaganda (advertisements) of housewives to show the girls that throwing their education away for a happy home is a mistake. One of her students, Joan, is accepted to Yale Law School, but her decision and freedom is ultimately her own to decide.<br /><br />This was a better movie than I expected after reading several reviews. The period costumes and music really transported me to a simpler time. Julia Roberts' character was delightfully down to earth, and the many big-name young stars (Kirsten Dunst, Topher Grace, Julia Stiles, Maggie Gyllenhaal) fit seamlessly into the fabric of the early 1950s. The scenery of Wellesley College (filmed on location) reminded me strongly of my own campus (Michigan State with its Beaumont Tower). The film has moments of humor, but also darker moments of jealousy and spite that result in larger consequences (the firing of the school nurse, a broken relationship, a girl being thrown out of her home).<br /><br />The DVD comes with a few extras, namely three featurettes on College: Now and Then, Art History, and What Women Wanted: 1953, which all feature movie footage interspersed with interviews from cast and crew, a music video for Elton John's \\"The Heart of Every Girl,\\" and several movie trailers.lle, and Connie) is shown throughout the year at different campus events, which serves to develop their characters and to see the difference that Katherine makes on their lives (Giselle aspires to be more like Katherine). <br /> <br />Katherine soon is introducing \\"dangerous, subversive\\" feminist ideas by using propaganda (advertisements) of housewives to show the girls that throwing their education away for a happy home is a mistake.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|For all the long time fans of Depeche Mode 'Playing the Angel' is a return to top form. It sounds like the old Depeche Mode we know and love from the 80's, without sounding antiquated. I know I will be listening to this CD years from now. Fantastic job DM!

B000002UJQ|5.0|Alrite, I will keep it short and simple. I firt got amneshiac and didnt really like it...fastforward a few years later and I got this amazing record. It is a great introduction to a phonominal band. BUY IT TODAY.
B000AADYYO|5.0|When I first bought \\"Damnation\\" the weekend after it came out, I was, how to say, surprised. Not necessarily unpleasantly, as I think that's an incredible CD, but it's simply not Opeth. Ever since that weekend I'd been anticipating Opeth's next release to see if they change their style to the soft of \\"Damnation\\" or leave it the metal they've built their legacy upon. Needless to say, Opeth had a pretty high bar they had to clear. Such is the case when one anticipates a CD for 2 years. And when a band so gracefully fulfills every expectation put before them, what else is there to say but \\"Wow!!\\"  <br /> <br />This CD marked some changes and new landmarks for the band, and I cannot say that it was a bad thing. The first change is the inclusion of Per Wiberg on the keys. Opeth's never been a band to shy away from a well-placed keyboard or mellotron, but up until this point, it wasn't an instrument that would regularly find itself into their songs. With a full-time keyboardist, now they have full-time keyboards. <br /> <br />Another change is that there are moments where the guitars are much less technical than they were before. I've read reviews of people mentioning this with a sort of negative attitude, but they seem to miss the point. The guitars only do this occasionally, so it's not like Akerfeldt or Lindgren are getting lazy; this is done so that Per can shine. For specific example, see the intro to track 3, \\"Beneath the Mire.\\" <br /> <br />It seems especially silly think that the guitars are more basic when viewed in the light of a landmark Opeth song, \\"The Grand Conjuration.\\" (Of which there is video, another Opeth landmark.) This song's guitar solo uses hammer-ons in a way that is very atypical Opeth, but is used in a perfect way. <br /> <br />Moving on from advancements, we move on to song writing. Mikael Akerfeldt seems to be a well springing with ideas, and it seems that the more he taps his creative genius, the more the creativity flows forth. Opeth is my favorite band of all time, but I'll admit that every one of their other albums has parts that seem to go on just a little too long, or are not quite as good as some other parts of the album. This album, however, has the ability to hold my attention better than any other album they've ever done. The reason is because when they're doing the parts that \\"drag on,\\" they've figured out better ways to spice them up a bit so that there's always something new to focus on. <br /> <br />As for the musicianship, there's only one level at which Opeth will allow themselves to play, and that's at 120% effort. Your first listen will easily allow you to hear the great playing of the guitarists. Akerfeldt and Lindgren put their all into this CD as usual, and it shows. It's Opeth, what do you expect? As you dig a little deeper, listen to the amazing drum work of Martin Lopez. The guy is to his drum set what Claude Monet was to his paint pallett. Lopez unabashedly uses everything at his disposal in an eternally intersting way, but so subtly that it's amazing when you focus on it, but perfectly blended when you focus on other aspects. When you turn your focus on the bass work of Martin Mendez, you can tell the guy's been playing the bass for his entire life. He is every bit as talented with his instrument as anyone else in the band is with theirs, and he's not afraid to show it. As far as the keyboard goes, bringing in Per was a good move. He's subtle when he has to be, flashy when appropriate, and his contribution, in whatever form it presents itself is always welcome. <br /> <br />This brings me to the vocals. I'm honestly left speechless when it comes to Akerfeldt's voice. It's my opinion that Akerfeldt has the most amazing throat in the world. I've never heard anyone else who can growl as brutally and ferociously as he can and still be able to turn around and sing as if he'd never evern heard a growl before. And the melodies he sings are just jaw-droppingly good. Honestly, I think theCD is worth every penny just for the first 2 1/2 minutes of \\"Reverie/Harlequin Forest\\" and the closing song \\"Isolation Years.\\" <br /> <br />In conclusion, I think this CD is worth more than 5 stars, is the best muscial release in all of 2005 and is a must-buy for fans of Opeth and those looking to be fans.
B00005NNMJ|3.0|It might be really hard for me to rate this album accuratly, because it IS a good 80s heavy metal record, its just that it doesn't grab me anymore like it did when i first listened to it. <br /> <br />Just bear with me, 3.5 stars is not bad by my book, it is what i would call above average. If i had reviewed this two years ago, i probably would have given this a 5. I thought this was the greatest thing since sliced bread when i heard the title track to this album, \\"Balls to the Wall\\", so naturally the power of that song carried over into the rest of the album, which made songs like \\"London Leather Boys\\", \\"Head Over Heals\\", \\"Turn Me On\\" ect sound better then they actually are. Udo has always been one of the more unconventional voices in rock, i can't put my finger on it exactly, he's like a combination of Bon Scott and Brian Johnson, so this REALLY makes the band sound like AC/DC wanna be's, which hurts them more then helps them. The other mentionable musician is Wolf Hoffmann, who is one of the better heavy metal guitar players and much better then given credit for, he's about 1,000,000 times more skilled and talented then today's overrated douches like Kirk Hammett or Dimebag Darrle. Hoffmann is really the best part of the band, the secondary guitarist (Herman Frank) and the rhythm section just seem to go by the motions and are not particulary worth talking about. Basically, gets this for Udo's screachy voice and Hoffmann's buzzsaw riffs and highly  <br />melodic solos. <br /> <br />The songs are inconsistant, which is really a problem in most Accept albums. You have two songs which i would consider a 90-100% which are the title track and \\"Winter Dreams\\", about 3 songs which are around 70-80% which are \\"London Leather Boys\\", \\"Fight it Back\\" and \\"Head Over Heals\\" and the rest of the tracks (\\"Love Child\\", \\"Losing More Then You Ever Had\\", \\"Gaurdians\\", ect) which are bland, stale, generic and probably only good for B-sides which i would all put below a 40-50%. Good band, just not enough good material. <br /> <br />I actually found that albums like *Restless and Wild* or *Breaker* to be much better then *Balls*. This is really the album when Accept started going commercial, not *Metal Heart*, like everyone else thinks. You can hear the cookie cutter style 80's mainstream metal in this album in most spots, you can definatly hear that they slowed down from their last album and tried to make their sound more accesible. I really don't listen to this much anymore, maybe like once in a blue moon every so often, it's starting to sound way too dated if you ask me. Overall though, if you want just strait forward 80's metal with nothing atached, then this would be good. <br />  <br /> <br />

6303402348|5.0|On the one hand, this movie is absolutely ridiculous, implausible, and full of mawkish sentimentality. On the other hand, it's entertaining, funny, and even wise. Somehow looking at the sophisticated world through the eyes of the unsophisticated Forrest Gump makes this story work and offers a refreshing look at things. The funny thing is, it's hard to like Forrest and it's hard to dislike him. That's because \\"normal\\" people are always caught between wanting more and wanting less. Forrest offers the perspective of someone not trapped in that struggle, in contrast to the struggles of Lt. Dan and Jenny, and shows us how simple love and acceptance can create a life of profound meaning, purpose, and happiness.
B0009I7NNA|4.0|I'll be honest, i have been following this band since this new album.  I have heard bits of their older stuff, and it is pretty good.  I do see what some people mean by the screaming.  Regardless though, i think that this band is pretty cool.  I like the fact that they can rub off as (but not completely are) metal.  You can hear their punk influences in their first 2 songs.  From then on, it is leaning more to the metal side.  I think that they have a unique sound, and the screaming is truly unnecessary.  What people need to do is stop categorizing them as metal, so some of these \\"music, or metal fans\\" can get off their case.   <br /> <br />It's a good CD.  Give it a chance, and don't expect METAL!
B000001FFJ|5.0|If you haven't heard any Tom Waits - listen to Rain Dogs.  Everything that he does best is here.  I heard this first a couple of years after it came out, and was freaked that it had been recorded in 1985 - proof that there is always brilliant music being made, if only you could find it.  This is deceptively simple-sounding, non-categorisable music.  He makes it sound so easy - but it it was really that easy, then why can't other people do it?
B000002MFN|5.0|I'm not gonna say that this is her best album because I think that ALL her albums are her best,but I will say that this is one of her most \\"mature\\"albums.And every one should know by now that the album doesn't have to do with sex.The album was named Erotica because that was the first single and they decided to name this after it.I don't own this and I want it so badly,but my friend at school showed it to me and all the songs are koooo!Deeper & Deeper,Fever,Erotica,and Secret Garden are my favorites.And also I agree with the reviewer(forgot the name!)that said that she sounds like Kylie Minogue on Bye Bye Baby.This album gets an A++++++++++ simply because Deeper is on it!
0670033375|5.0|I just finished reading Jared Diamond's latest book, \\"Collapse: How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed.\\" I found it to be, like his last book \\"Guns, Germs and Steel\\", a work of remarkable scholarly synthesis and a thoroughly enjoyable read. To share my joy in the hopes of persuading you to read it, I'll offer some of my thoughts on the book.     Diamond begins the book with his first case study, modern Montana. He goes into great detail about Montana's current environmental and economic troubles, and is careful to explain how each effects the other, and how Montanans are dealing with-or not dealing with-their issues. This actually sets the tone for the remainder of the book, as his purpose is to examine the environmental conditions of both past and present failed and successful societies and come to some conclusion as to what degree their success or failure was influenced by both their environmental conditions-and more importantly-their reaction to them. And by beginning in a modern \\"society\\" familiar to all Americans he immediately frees you of the assumption that this book will merely be about long-dead societies and dry archaeological research.     The reason for this is because Diamond isn't interested in examining these other societies simply for the sake of knowledge. Rather, his book is to serve as a guide into how modern societies can learn from these examples from the past and present, in order to utilize environmental resources in a way that is ultimately beneficial to the society.     The thing I found most note-worthy about the book is how Diamond helps you to see the relationship between these past societies and modern societies. For most of us it's very easy to view ancient societies in the abstract, as merely a collection of information we've received from archaeological excavation and whatever written records they may have left behind. It's harder to view them as those living in those societies must have viewed them, and to understand how what was happening to them may have appeared to the people living on those times. Why is that important? If we can understand how the members of those societies viewed what was happening to them, then we might be able to recognize signs of the same issues in our modern societies.     The most compelling example of this in the book is the genocide in modern Rwanda. Most of us, even those of us well-read on the topic, have come to view the genocide purely as a political, historical and cultural issue. But Diamond points us to the example of the Kanama Commune in Northwest Rwanda, which at the time of the genocide was populated almost entirely by Hutu. Despite this and the fact that most of the genocidal violence was committed by Hutu towards the Tutsi, there were still mass killings in the province. Why? As two researchers discovered, it was mostly the result of extreme competition over land resources, much of which had grown scarce as a result of over-population. So what at first appears to us to be but a minor element in the overall genocide, in fact reveals itself more to be opportunistic violence aimed at securing land.     The purpose of this example is to help us realize that what appears to us as political or social disorder may in fact be caused ultimately by environmental factors. Much evidence of the collapse of past societies tells us that as societies began to run out of resources, rather then sit around and passively starve, the societies were frequently split by conflict, turning either on themselves (Easter island) or on their neighbors (Mayan kingdoms.) To me this is the most important lesson of the book, that the negative effects of environmental degradation can come to us disguised as \\"mere\\" political conflict.    He also points out the efforts the elites went to in these societies to insulate themselves from the effects of environmental degradation, citing the examples of the Norse chiefs in Greenland, the chiefs of Easter Island, and the elites of Anasazi society, who lived in relative affluence compared to their subjects. Yet when faced with the ultimate exhaustion of their resources and the destruction of their societies, Diamond points out the these people frequently had the privilege of merely being the \\"last to starve.\\" He compares this to the circumstances of the elite today who in America live in gated communities, or who in third world nations live in high-rise apartments in the city while the majority of other citizens live in shanty towns. Diamond doesn't point this similarity out because he's secretly a Marxist who wishes to deprive the elites of their property. Rather, he highlights this because the ability of the elites to shelter themselves from the consequences of their decisions, as the leaders of their nations, skews those very decisions that they make. Elites who are shielded from the most immediate effects of environmental degradation may only become aware of the consequences of their own decisions when it is too late not only for the other citizens of their nation, but for themselves. To emphasize this he gives us the example of residents of New Guinea, who have maintained sustainable levels of agriculture on their island for nearly 3,000 years. In contrast to the elite of Easter Island, who competed with each other to build larger and larger statues and shielded themselves from the effects deforestation as long as they could, the leaders in New Guinea society lived in huts like other citizens, and were expected to grow their own food for their own households in the same manner as other farmers.     In fact, since Diamond's overall purpose is to examine how societies made the decisions they did so as to learn how to emulate their successes and avoid their mistakes, he takes a careful look at how we arrive at the decisions we make today. He's point in the manner in which market forces can hurt environmental interests, but he counters that with examples of how the market can actually work to regulatethe use of natural resources. He points the fallacies by which earlier societies made decisions in error as to how long their resources would last, how they could sustain their resources, or how they failed to be aware that they were even facing environmental problems, and points out how those same fallacies operate today. He examines ways in which change can occur from the top-down, in the form of regulation or even dictatorial decree, and from the bottom-up, in the forms of market pressure, grass-roots campaigns, and local initiatives, and gives us examples of each and how effective and ineffective they are. In other words, he does his best to adapt the lessons of failed societies to our societies today in a manner that we can use.     In his conclusion, Diamond is cautiously optimistic. While most of the book is about societies that failed to address their environmental problems, he mentions several that succeeded in a variety of ways. He highlights late medieval Japan, which successfully curtailed deforestation to become one of the most densely forested first world nations on Earth. He discusses the example of New Guinea, which has been successfully cultivated for human habitation for three millennia. And he highlights the isolated Pacific island of Tikopia, which succeeded in the same conditions under which several other Pacific islands failed. All of these are examples not only of how past societies succeeded, but of how we can overcome our environmental issues today, to succeed and thrive as well.    Of course there is considerably more then this to his book, and no review as short as mine could hope to do it justice. If you want to have some idea of the environmental problems we face both on a local and on a global level in the coming decades, as well as ideas for how we can deal with those problems, pick up \\"Collapse\\" and give it a thorough read. It's well worth the time and effort.
B00005Q66T|5.0|This is Madonna's greatest hits from the year 1992 through 2000.All the songs are koooo,especially Erotica,Deeper and Deeper and Bedtime Story!Although it's  missing a lot of songs that were hits!But overall it gets 100/100 for being a true singer.Here are the songs that were missiing that should have been added to this:Fever,Rain,Bad Girl,I'll Remember,You Must Love Me,This Used To Be My Playground,You'll See,Nothing Really Matters and American Pie.
B000B8I8WS|4.0|Now that's what I call quality metal. Although I was never a fan of bands who play death metal or metalcore or black metal or extreme metal or whatever they categorize themselves as these days....this album just exudes raw talent. right from the starting track, with howard jones' screaming to andols'great drumwork....this album kicks ass. Special mention should go to Matt HEafy and Joey Jordinson...probably THE most talented musicians in metal today...they should really form a band. There's soemthing for everyone in this album - and although I usually skip tracks that has glen benton or dani filth or any other mindless screamer /growler...i still give it an occasional listen..to hear the amazing guitar, bass and drum work.Great album.....the DVD was a GREAT addition...very entertaining..and i was just awestruck seeing these guys play.. <br />definitely buy it if you are a metal fan..
B000696PWC|5.0|This is not only Ultimate Kylie but it's the ultimate collection!This is the first 2 disc greatest hits album I have that has 33 tracks!!!!I like all her songs from Better the Devil You Know to Can't Get You Out Of My Head.I especially like the new song \\"Giving You Up\\"!But I still haven't seen the videos to all of these songs(only some).This is defenitly a good greatest hits album of all time.Although some songs were missing.But still great!
B000AU9UYM|3.0|This movie was pretty good.  The action was great and the story line about batman's beginning was terrific...except for a few things.  Now anybody correct me if I am wrong on this stuff.  In \\"Batman Begins\\" Commissioner Gordon is a skinny little guy who actually drives the batmobile.  In the original Batman, Commissioner Gordon is a heavier set guy who is not even sure who Batman is when they first see him.  Also, when Bruce's parents get killed they don't mention anything about the guy saying \\"Have you ever danced with the devil in the pale moon light.\\"  Which is what the Joker says to his victims because we all know the Joker killed Bruce's parents.  I was dissapointed that nothing was connected there.  The last thing was the bat signal.  At the end of the first Batman is when Batman gives the signal over to Gordon.  Yet at the end of Batman begins it seems he gave them a signal which is different from the original.  Anyone can correct me if something I said was wrong but I was just dissapointed in the differences.
0316168815|3.0|The idea for this is fabulous, and at first I loved the whole concept of Heaven that Sebold sets up. But she can't carry through with the conceit -- indeed, the wonderful imaginative touches of the beginning disappear as the book wears on.  <br /> <br />The end was totally contrived and nearly embarrassing, while a lot of later plot twists were as well. I give Sebold points for concept and, in some cases, brutally wonderful prose. But the final execution really doesn't hold together. Over-hyped.

You can only listen to the music on your comp using the software on the CD.  You can;t just simply rip the music.  You can rip it using their software, but only in protected WMA format.  There is no mention of this on the Amazon site or the CD.

B000002HPT|5.0|.......I can't, for the life of me see how any Dream Theater fan can truly dislike this cd. This album has some of DT's most beautifully crafted songs out of any in their vast catalog. They slowed things down and toned things down with the technicality somewhat, but these songs have a wonderful emotion and feeling that DT hasn't ever again reproduced in quite the same way.  <br /> <br />My response to the haters of this album is this: \\"Dream Theater has MANY MANY albums that totally rock out and send your head spinning with wonderful technical skills and structures. So why can't they slow things down on an album every once in a while and show us their other side that creates very emotional songs that may be a bit simpler but still keeping the DT style intact?\\" <br /> <br />As for me, I LOVE this CD, and I have thought of this being my favorite of Dream Theater's releases for a long time. It still might be in fact. Plus, I am now 32 years old and I have to say that maybe one day I won't be into the really fast head spinning music into my 40's and 50's but I believe I can always like this album no matter what age.  <br /> <br />Keep an open mind on this one and you won't be dissapointed!
B000AV2G3I|3.0|How do you figure this one?  Five years ago, finally, Lennon's catalog was getting remastered...I thought. Capital/EMI released a remixed/remastered Plastic Ono Band on October 10, 2000.  Great, I thought, sounds great, can't wait for the rest of the albums to get the treatment.  Shouldn't be long, I thought.  After all, we're getting up there in age.  Not a lot of time left... <br /> <br />Well, here it is five years later, and there still putzing around with Lennon's catalog.  Two of Lennon's albums STILL haven't got the remix/remaster treatment (Sometime In NYC & Walls & Bridges).  Sometime certainly wasn't John's finest moment, but it still deserves the same treatment as the rest of the catalog gets, and Walls & Bridges...well, the wait is just ridiculous. <br /> <br />Instead, we get this.  What, I'm supposed to buy this fourth or fifth rehash of a Lennon \\"best of\\" because it's got remixes of some of the non-album singles or for the remixed Walls & Bridges cuts?  You bastards!!!!  You haven't sucked enough money out of the Beatles' music?  And I don't even mind you sucking the money, but can't you give us some decent product in return?   <br /> <br />I'm pissed about the handling of Lennon's catalog, Harrison's catalog and the Beatles' catalog.  That's it.  For 4 human beings who had some integrity when this music was orginally recorded, well, this is not very fitting to their memory, I guarantee.  There is so much that could be done (for the fans, the ones who will continue to spend money on this product) that is not being done, and so much that is being done that needn't be done.  Sad, very sad.
0671027344|5.0|This book was one of the most moving books ive read in a while.  Shows the truth of the teenagers life.  I personally loved it.  Unpredictable, just an all around great book.
0060839872|5.0|In a search for broader intellectual, philosophical, and spiritual vistas, I finally read the book I had been interested in for twenty years.  I was ready to read it now, at this stage in my life, as a father, and the result was moving, even disturbing, at a deep level.  If I had tried to wade through it twenty years ago, I wouldn't have made it, and if I did, I wouldn't have gotten a lot out of it. <br /> <br />It is not an easy read.  There are times when it was a workout trying to follow the philosophical discourse.  Part of the effort, intentional or not, was that the narrative was tracking the thoughts of an insane man.  The thrust of the book, a first-person exposition of schizophrenia, expanded my understanding of mental illness in a way that no third-person study or medical or mental health text could have done.  The father-son relationship was, as a sub-text, one of the more emotionally touching, almost painful, aspects of the book. <br /> <br />This unusual book does not fall into a catefory of any sort, and it is one of the best books I've ever read.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Sincerely I think that Playing the Angel is the best record since violator. Many people are debating among the diferents records for see what's the best, at the end, just the time will have the answer. If you see that this effort is not like ultra(for me one of my favorite), it just like any artist won't want to make the same work in their new proyects, is part of Depeche Mode to challenge their fans and themselves. I'm not going to make a review of each song, i just want to say that THE PECHE IS BACK and this is the begining of a new wave.
B0000TB01Y|5.0|Chenowith and Mendel are absolutely spectacular in this.  Their voices mesh well (almost too well sometimes).  Defying Gravity is spine tingling.  I'll never watch the Wizard of Oz again with the same perspective.
B00000K0T8|5.0|Some guy reviewd this cd and was boggled by the significance of the cover.  Let me bless you, The wu-tang, but mostly ghostface cappadona and raekwon, are obsessed with british shoes called Wallabees.  On \\"Glaciers of Ice\\" a track from raekwon's \\"only built for cuban linx\\" Ghostface is telling raekwon that he had the idea of dyeing his wallabees in two different colors inorder to increase their flavor.  Ghostface is know as the wallee-champ for his creative wallabees, on the cover of ironman, Ghostface, Raekwon, and Cappadonna are overseeing the production of their multi-colored wallabees.  It makes perfect sense.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|I will NOT be purchasing this DVD from Paramount.  They are not known for producing good DVD's, and now we can see why.  Why would an American film be released with FEWER discs than Latin America and Britain will get???  Actually, when you look at the extras that are included on all 4 discs, it is not really impressive.  How can a historical fiction story of one of the most memorable disasters of all time be released in a \\"special edition\\" DVD with no documentary of the actual tragedy???  When I look at the extras that are on the 4th DVD, I really don't think we're missing much.  But what could Paramount have done with that 4th disc????  They could have had one disc about the making of the film, and another disc about the actual tragedy.  Now THAT would have been an awesome DVD presentation.  Paramount needs to take some lessons from a studio such as Warner Brothers who REALLY knows how to pull out all the stops when producing special editions of classic films.  Instead of purchasing a special effects extraveganza that is given mediocre treatment on DVD, why not spend your money on the 3-disc set of the Wizard of Oz from Warner Brothers???  Check out the list of features on that DVD set, and you'll see the treatment a TRUE classic film should receive.  I've waited 6 years for a decent DVD release of Titanic, I guess I'll have to wait a few more.  Maybe 20th Century Fox will produce the Ultimate Edition later on.  After all, they have a pretty good track record of some excellent DVD special editions (e.g. Alien Quadrilogy).  Until then, I'm off to see the Wizard....YES!!!!!!
B000005Z0E|4.0|This album is great, there are obviously better produced albums of his but this album of all of them probably has the best most deep lyrics and depics a young black males struggle through life and is worth it just for the lyrics it could b accapella n it wud still b gud but there are also some very well produced songs on it also and are just great and i highly reccomend this to any 2pac fan, the stand out songs are as  follows <br />Trapped   <br />If My Homie Calls    <br />Brenda's Got A Baby    <br />Rebel Of The Underground    <br />Part Time Mutha   <br />
B00005BL2A|1.0|Just the other day I was dealing with my two screaming kids in a grocery line.  When I approached the check-out lady I noticed my \\"bagger\\" was a young high school student wearing a NIN t-shirt.  When I excitedly told him I was going to their concert he looked at me like I was from outerspace.  OK - that made me feel really really old.  Which brings on my next point. <br /> <br />DM is really really really making me feel old right now.  I think it's because they have progressively gotten slower and slower and slower with time.  I didn't even buy this album - I listened to the sample cuts on amazon.com and I could barely make it through the end of each sample.  When I saw the cover I half expected to see the band members in wheelchairs with oxygen canules.  What happened to this band?!  I used to think they made the change with Violator to be more \\"mainstream\\" and \\"modern\\" but after listening to this album I can't imagine they'll see a major \\"boost\\" in album sales.  In fact, who listens to this drivel?  Honestly, have we all gotten so old that we're ready to place DM in the \\"easy listening\\" category? <br /> <br />So here's the plan.  Maybe if we all quit buying their mind-numbing drivel they would start making music that might actually make you tap your hands on a steering wheel again - or maybe even inspire you to bob your head to a beat.  Is there a beat in this album? <br /> <br />If DM has truly chosen to make this change permanent than they should seriously consider changing their name - maybe Chicago II or Kenny G Mode.  Maybe that would help those of us who are truly fans of real Depeche Mode feel a little relieved that their name can still live on as one of the most memorable pioneers of some of the best synth and keyboard music ever written and recorded. <br /> <br />As a side note...  Apparently (according to his website) Trent Resnor has been dry and sober for four years now and his most recent album \\"With Teeth\\" is far from lullaby music.  I would think getting off drugs would be a reason to celebrate not make everyone wish you were back on them!!
B000001GJU|5.0|The Smetana on this CD was the highpoint for me.  The Dvorak is a great work and I have heard many excellent productions of it.  This one is very enjoyable and the sound is fabulous.  All soloists are clearly heard and the stereo image is great.  The surprise for me was the Smetana which it turns out is a lovely piece of music played and recorded beautifully here.  The beginning in which he tries to reproduce the movement of water in a stream is captivating.  That is followed by one of the more hummable tunes I have encountered in music.  Recommended highly.
B0000A118M|5.0|Coltrane dedicates 'Supreme' to God-and I think it's Exhibit A as to why athiests will never be taken seriously in the jazz world. Alice Coltrane compared this 4-part suite   to Moses coming off the mountain,when Coltrane emerged from seclusion after composing it  is beautiful from all angles-and his bandmates McCoy Tyner on piano,Jimmy Garrison on bass and Elvin Jones were never better.I'm not real crazy about all of Coltrane's improvizational experimentation,but for me-'Supreme' is a religious experience.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|First of all.... Eugene A. Schubert \\"be-bop\\" your an idiot. Sounds like you want Batman & Robin instead. They already made that movie, this is a more grown-up movie. <br /> <br />Secondly, I'll try to keep this short, when I went to watch this in the theater this was not the Batman movie I was expecting to see... this was something much better. <br /> <br />Most Sc-Fi super heroe movies are just biding thier time until the hero puts on the costumes, but this movie is watchable from begining to end. Nolan hit's all the right notes, the editing is fantastic, and Bale feels like he nails the character Bruce Wayne with precision. Bat-man is at his heart, a facist, believing the world should function as he sees it. That's why he operates outside the law. Only truly trusting one cop, who manages to help him stay balanced. <br /> <br />All in all the best batman movie hands down, and just a great character driven flick period. Spider-man 2 is a whiney second best after this came out.
B00008H2LB|2.0|I was made to listen to Linkin Park's Meteoria by a friend of mine who insisted that if I just gave this album a listen, that I would fall in love with it like he did.  Their last album Hybrid Theory, along with the saturation of Limp Bizkit and Korn made me jump of the nu-metal bandwagon.  But I didn't want to be rude so I borrowed his copy. <br /> <br />Meteoria is not the worst album i've ever heard.  Sure it's formulaic as can be, but I think their is potential for something better from these guys.  Every song has a weird electronic intro that moves into a shredding guitar riff, that moves into a verse sung by either the rapper of the singer.  Whoever doesn't sing the verse handles the chorus.  The bridge is usually some dissonant guitar noise that disolves into screaming and the song runs out of steam.   <br /> <br />Seriously folks, listen to the album and you'll see every song is the same.  My next gripe is the lyrics.  The first thing you hear on this album is \\"sometimes I have to remember just to breath.\\"  I hate self loathing in music, especially insincere self loathing.  Somewhere I Belong is an anthem that a 14 year may identify with, but I think that i've moved beyond caring that much about fitting in.  The singer has a nasally voice and is seldom actually singing, he yells on most of the tracks.  The rapper is very monotone and doesn't really add much to any of the songs.   <br /> <br />Musically, the band is kind of generic.  Their stuff sounds like a mish mash of nu-metal progenitors Korn and a host of heay metal bands that have come before it.  The DJ is kind of annoying also.  He doesn't seem to really have a point.   <br /> <br />Here's where I see potential.  Breaking the Habit is actually a pretty good song.  It isn't as formulaic as the rest of the album.  Nobody's listening has a cool flute loop on it and I think an expansion on a more hip hop sound would do these guys good.   <br /> <br />So overall, I say avoid this.  It's really pretty cookie cutter and generic and I don't think a fan of intelligent rock music would be in to this.  Go buy a Fugazi record for real emotion and intensity.
B000784WMW|2.0|I own all the films portraying Jane Eyre. I was, and am, happy to have another. But this was such a disappointment. Dalton gave a quality performance but the direction and the editing and the selection of Jane were all so bad as to have him babbling on and on in the service of nothing. It was interesting to see another view of Jane's school years - a view that was far less horrific than other adaptations. In fact, it was nicer than the fashionable boarding school I attended many years ago. Not an institution that could have beaten all the spunk out of the child  firebrand that was given us in this version. Zelah Clarke is not just way too old, she is homelier than necessary and too little (to the point of being inconsequential) for Dalton, and without any attribute of the mind and spirit  that could possibly inspire the passion exhibited by  Dalton. The Ciaran Hinds' production was far, far superior and the casting and direction for Jane in that one was even better than the Joan Fontaine of yore. Further, it was apparent they used more than one camera and knew how to produce a balanced and believable production. (Even the dog was better.)
B000002LK1|3.0|I'll buck the trend here. I am a big fan of DM, but this album (with the exception of Halo) leaves me disappointed whenever I listen to it. There's only about 3 songs I won't skip through. At best, it's average. Maybe it's because it was played to death. Doesn't come near Music for the Masses or Black Celebration. I'd say this album marks the start of DM's slide. Plus Violator has one of DM's most annoying songs - Personal Jesus. It's almost as annoying as Master and Servant.
B000AARKOO|5.0|Well I have to say this movie totally surprised me, I went to watch it just 'cause it was an Orlando Bloom movie and I found a deep story, moving characters and a storyline that really inspired me. <br />Not only the casting was really well made, to have Liam Neeson as Godfrey of Ibelin adds a deep to his character that is amazing specially if you think that he's just in the beginning of the movie, Jeremy Irons as Tiberias became a favorite of mine since he's not only a great character but a really human one, David Thewlis as the Hospitaler said some of my favorite lines in this movie and created a statement of the way things should be done in this Kingdom of Heaven.  <br />Orlando Bloom really surprised me since he managed to grow every second of the movie and portrayed himself as a real unwilling hero, I was also happy and taken aback by the casting of Edward Norton as King Baldwin IV since he managed to project strength and pain only with his voice and I really got to love his character.. <br />This story is not only astounding in the casting that also had Ghassan Massoud as Saladin and Khaled El Nabaoui as Mullah that are totally new for me and where really inspired in their performances but it also shows a part of history that I never knew and that in this times is really important, peace, an armistice and respect between 2 great kingdoms, 2 great men and 2 religions. <br />I think this movie is a must see, not only as a learning experience but as a entertainment since the action is a big ingredient of this story. <br />I totally recommend and praise this story, Ridley Scott managed to create another beautiful, gorgeous and striking world in this movie with the help of  the remarkable writer William Monahan. Be well and take care.
B000AM4PBS|3.0|This show was OKAY! I think it was simply overrated while on tv. I personally don't understand why you'd waste $200 on some dvds. I think it's pretty silly to spend that kind of money on dvds, but I guess if you have the money to throw away!? Overall, save your money the show wasn't that great.

B0007O38F8|5.0|50-Cent is the grooviest. Early in my life I thought for sure I'd find someone who'd love me and I could love back. It hasn't worked out that way. I've had a spell of bad luck that seems to have lasted for years. I hate my boss and I have thoughts about quitting, but fear grips me and I can't do it. My gosh, what a failure I am.  Working 35 hours a week, going home to an empty apartment, no friends. Heavy debt. My only outlets for creative expression are my synthesizer and watching late-night TV.

B00005JO0J|1.0|I noticed a rabid browncoat mentioned Orson Scott Card comment <br />about Serenity being the \\"best movie ever\\".If there was any doubt about the man's taste and sanity after his other screeds this year, this one seals the deal for me.  <br /> <br />Are you kidding me??? That's like saying you voted for Bush because you don't want a rich man to be president! Better than 2001: A SPACE ODYSSEY? BLADE RUNNER? BACK TO THE FUTURE? THE TERMINATOR? ALIEN? ALIENS? STAR WARS EPISODES I, II, III, IV, V, and VI? Well, maybe EPISODE I, but not by much. <br /> <br />I could also say that maybe he thinks SERENITY is better because because it shamelessly steals from many of those films. <br /> <br />Don't believe anything the Browncoat fans tell you. They will say <br />or do anything to get you see this movie. Joss Whedon did some <br />good work on Buffy and Angel, but Firefly and Serenity was a lame <br />attempt at ripping off Star Wars and Star Trek. Be afraid, be <br />very afraid!  <br />
B000069AUI|5.0|One: If you think Coldplay sucks, get a ticket to one of their concerts and get all of their music.  Two: If you are dissing their songs played on the radio, a)you have no taste in music and b)listen to \\"Fix You,\\" \\"Swallowed in the Sea\\" and \\"Square One\\" among others.  Three: If after both of these, you still don't like Coldplay, stop listening to them, stop writing stupid reviews, and go buy some Rage.
B0007Y4TVU|5.0|This album was my introduction to SOAD, and it's one of my favorite albums, hands down.  The instrumental skill and interesting harmonies make this group one I don't get tired of listening to.  I am eagerly anticipating Hypnotize...
B000000Y27|5.0|Great band playing. A good album to appreciate one of the great jazz guitarists.
B0007Y4TVU|3.0|System of a Down broke into the  music industry with a bang with both their release of their self-titled debut and a headlining place on the Ozzfest tour. Singles such as Sugar and Spiders enjoyed some air space, but the band remained on the fringes of rock even at a time when music was getting heavier (about the same time as Korn and Limp Bizkit's popularity). With their second release, Toxicity, the band delivered some major hits including Chop Suey, Toxicity, and Aerials. Their bland of playful, aggressive, and quasi-political funk metal became so popular that they were able to recycle songs from B-sides and their pre-label days with Steal this Album. Then the band took a little break and began to fade from the airwaves. They finally came to release a new CD, which is of course Mezmerize.  <br /> <br />This CD marks the most drastic change System of a Down has made to their music since they began. Unfortunantly, most of the changes are for the worse. The most noticable change is in the tone of the guitar. In previous albums, the guitar had a distinctive hard edged sound. Now, for some reason, the guitars sound like 80s heavy metal (not neccessarily a bad thing, but different). We also now get to hear A LOT more singing from the guitarist rather than the lead singer (once again not a bad thing, but different). Lastly, the songs seem more drawn out...more tedious. This is because while in earlier albums SOD had no problem cutting their songs to a minute and a half or two minutes they now feel compelled to make the songs 3, 4, and even 5 minutes long. By doing this, SOD loses some of the short and sweet songs that dominated other CDs and seem to be trying to make every track into a single. In general, the CD does not feel like SOD. With all that said, taken independently of other efforts this is not a bad CD. It has variety, an interesting pace and feel, and the CD will eventually grow on you. I would recommend purchase, but I would caution hardcore fans that this is something different. <br /> <br />The first track is a light intro. Immediately, we then jump into BYOB, the band's first single from the album. If you like this song, great. I hate it. But even if you don't like it, don't be concerned it is one of the weakest songs on the CD. <br /> <br />Revenga is the closest thing we get to classic SOD. However, the guitar just sounds bizarre and a throw back to the 80s. We also get a lot of singing from the guitarist here, which I think added a lot to the song. <br /> <br />Cigaro at first comes off as really stupid. It begins \\"My c*ck is much bigger than yours,\\" and it gets even more immature. It's not exactly clear if they're trying to be sarcastic, but even if they are it's a cheap trick. Cigaro also has a very annoying bridge between the chorus and bridge where the guitar plays some odd backwards scale with high pitched vocals. Yet, this song may eventually grow on you. <br /> <br />Radio/Video sounds like it was meant to be single (which is why I ask why did they make BYOB a single?) Yet, the song suffers from more lame lyrics and some odd musical interludes. I really like what they did with the Beatles-esque harmonies midway through the song (we'll hear more of this on Lost in Hollywood). The buildup to the end is also very interesting. In all a very bizarre track that'll eventually grow on you. It really is completely unlike anything SOD has done before. <br /> <br />The Cocaine... once again has a guitar sound completely foreign to SOD. It actually sounds like one of those poppy hard rock groups like Godsmack. The song is a bit repetitive and doesn't really go anywhere. <br /> <br />Violent Pornography is a decent song. It was one of my favorites when I first heard the CD, but on repeated listenings it's not that interesting.  <br /> <br />Question reminds me of a bad version of Toxicity. The singing is kind of grating and purposely off key and tempo. Honestly, this song kind of makes me disoriented. <br /> <br />Thebeginning of Sad Statue sounds like something out of Slayer (once again, not a problem, just different). But after the intro the song wonders a bit, but does have a strong sing-a-long chorus and some good interludes. This is one of my favorite songs on the album. But that isn't saying much...only an above average track. <br /> <br />Old School Hollywood. I don't know what they were thinking with this one. It certainly is bizarre. I can't say it's a bad song, but I think they can do better. If the CD was an hour long I could see including this, but why would you have it on a CD less than 40 minutes long. <br /> <br />Lastly we get Lost in Hollywood whose problems symbolize all of my criticisms towards this band. First let me say, musically it is a superb song full of Beatles-esque harmonies and great singing from the guitarist. With that out of the way, let me assault SOD, the supposed next Rage Against the Machine, for not making a political album. With this song, with its beautiful melodies and deep sound, which makes it perfect for radioplay, SOD should have tried to SAY SOMETHING. In the middle of such politically important events dominating our lives, couldn't have SOD have done something useful. At first, when I heard 'faggots' (for the amazon guy, faggots refers to ciggarrettes) I thought they're going to say something about gay marriage or something. Nope. As far as I can tell they only used it to rhyme with maggots. That's plain stupid. First of all, assuming they were being playful in choosing that word, they should have known that the word would now be played all over the airwaves. If they just used to fill the song, it was a mistake, because it's a very distracting term. With this song, SOD really blew a chance to say something. This is all part of a wider complaint with this band. Rather than do something constructive, they just pretend to be political. Instead of maybe talking about Nagorno-Karabagh...perhaps pushing for some kind of reconciliation withAzurris (I should add that this band is VERY well known in the Armenian community), all they talk about is Turkish recognition of genocide. It's an important subject, but they could be doing more to affect the lives of people today. Instead of singing a song about how empty Los Angeles is (like that's an original theme, pfft) perhaps they could have said something about Iraq or the Middle East in general and how Americans perceive what's going on there. All we get is this stupid song about something everybody already knows is stupid. It's like singing a song making fun of rapists. Say something interesting. <br /> <br />My rant aside, this CD signals a bizarre departure by SOD from the distinctive sound. The songs aren't bad, they just are odd. With enough listens you'll probably begin to enjoy it, but the CD still does not have the consistency or punch of their other records.
B000AARKO4|5.0|In a time where American media and propaganda poison the minds of people to think badly of Muslims,this movie was a deep and monumental way to see the History of the Crusades,during the almost 100 year reign that Christains held in Jerusalem,the religious capital of the world to several monotheistic religions.This movie has great production values,excellent acting,and an overall very warming,yet violent story about honor,religious morals,and as humans,we can learn to get along through the good of our hearts,and our mercy towards others.I am neither Christian nor Muslim,so I saw this movie without any discrimination towards any religion,which is why I enjoyed so in the light that I could not be offended by anything in this beautifully crafted film.Ridley Scott did it with Gladiator,but with this film,he surpassed my expectations,and brought a great vision of Heroism to the screen that today's nations somehow lack,and the deep respect of thos different from you.Thank you,Ridley Scott.
6300182193|4.0|I saw this film when it first came out and I never wanted to see another Dracula again. The reason -- Frank Langella as the Prince of Darkness! The 1979 version of the film was translated from Broadway but was first done on the London stage back in the 20s with guess who playing the title role. Langella reprises the role for Broadway with brilliant and Gothic inspired sets by Edward Gory and the Tony awards flew at the production. <br /> <br />Most appealing and still the highlight of the film version is the seduction of Lucy (Kate Nelligan) and the visceral presentation of vampire lust in the not so Victorian sense. Langella nibbles ear lobes instead of chomping necks and his style is hotter than hot with Lucy, a dinner guest who chooses to stay rather than protect her maidenly virtue of the era. <br /> <br />Director John Badham shot on location in Cornwall near Penzance and the moody appearance of the English countryside is transferred to the film. The wonderful actors Sir Lawrence Olivier as Abraham Van Helsing and Donald Pleasence as the always hungry asylum doctor are scene stealers. Both the gruesome and grotesque is never shielded on screen as Mina turns from sickly to ghoulish with Dracula's help. Interior settings are technically right, the elements of the period setting perfect for the ensemble cast. <br /> <br />However, it is Langella's Dracula that changed the perception of the vile seducer of young women with his performance. Unlike the Lugosi and Christopher Lee performances, Langella's vampire is a lover, he waltzes to the \\"Blue Danube,\\" and women will want to parade in a nightgown forever with him as did stunning Nelligan's Lucy, whose duo coffin snuggle is both erotic and protective of her \\"man.\\" <br /> <br />Subtle costume touches include small bat-like winged caplets and dresses for Lucy, and dashing opera capes and cravats for Langella. If there is one element not sufficiently examined in Badham's film, it is the sense of impending doom that Dracula brings from his home via the coffins of earth from Transylvania to English soil, a xenophobia which Bram Stoker underscored in his novel. However, it is a minor point overlooked in a film which stands head and fangs above so many mediocre interpretations available today. It is simply THE bodice heaver adaptation from the late 70s.
B000B7HZXM|2.0|I'm glad I listened to this series on Napster-to-go before committing any money.  I LOVE the American standards, performed by almost anybody who \\"gets\\" it. Rosemary Clooney, Wesla Whitfield, Bette Midler, Michael Feinstein, etc.  Rod doesn't \\"get\\" it. All of the songs sound the same, they're all the same tempo, and his distinctive voice is simply unsuited to the genre and distracts from the simple beauty of the songs. The only thing that I can hope (and the reason it got 2 stars instead of 1) is that his name recognition will introduce new listeners to these classics.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'm not sure how I missed this when it was on TV.  Probably why it was cancelled.  But, this is an enjoyable show.   The characters are interesting and the storylines are all fresh.  I count this as a great find and highly recommend it.
B00074C6EC|5.0|This is the best rock and roll band going.  I was introduced to these guys by a mate in college back in '91.  Since then I've been hooked.  I thought they had broken up years back.  I though I'd probably been to my last ever Thunder gig. <br /> <br />I was shopping around and saw \\"The Magnificent Seventh\\" was available.  That made my day, for sure. <br /> <br />If you even \\"just like\\" The Darkness, then check out Thunder.  You will not regret it.  These guys played real rock'n'roll while some bought plaid thinking it was cool to be from Seattle and while Aerosmith went soft. <br /> <br />As good as the albums are, the live performances are better.  Luck enough to see them do an acoustic gig in Dublin.  The band apologised it was \\"just\\" acoustic.  The crowd left feeling they had heard a great band that did not need amps. <br /> <br />This particular album is a classic and rarely is out of my CD changer.
0307276902|2.0|Or have someone in your life who is/was. This book has received a lot of undeserved hype. Spoiled rich kid who can't understand why his sheltered upbringing has left him unarmored and unable to understand that Life Isn't Fair. Unfortunately it's become a literary genre of sorts in the last decade. In Frey's case, the writing, such as it is, is a bit precious, as are the typographical tricks, AND YET, I can see how this book would hold your attention if your own personal circumstances aligned with his. It's just a shame that he wasn't able to reveal his insights in a somewaht more accessible fashion.
B0002XDODU|5.0|After this album came out rammstein were declared the biggest selling german language band of all time.  Also this is the 4th rammstein album in a row I would rate a 10 out of 10 or better, meaning they are more than just a band with a few good songs or 1 album or 2.
0141301120|4.0|Even though I didnt enjoy this book as well as the first one, it was very cute and interesting.  Roald Dahl should have had a series of \\"Charlie\\"  books for us to enjoy. Adults as well as children will enjoy this book as a follow-up to Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.
B000AL730O|5.0|Same good ol' style.  Not quite the Beatles, but the style he developed himself after they broke up.  Over these years, paul has been the most successful with his solo career.  His influence in inmense.  I thank him for living.
0060194995|4.0|The reason why I choose this book was because it was very interesting.  It's the only book that I enjoyed reading.  I read this book last year in English clas, and it's one of my favorite books so far.  his book keeps you interested from the start till it ends.  The ending was exciting thrilling.  It's one of those books that when you start reading it, you don't want to stop until you finish. <br />This book takes place in Maycomb, Alabama in 1932 during the depression.  It's about a girl named Scout and her brother Jem.  They live with their dad Atticus.  Atticus is a lawyer who is raising his two kids because he's wife passed away when scout was two.  Atticus is a lawyer for a black innocent men being accused of a crime they did't commit.  Tom Robinson is one of the main characters in this book, he's being accused of raping a young women, but really her dad was the one who beat her because he say her with Tom Robinson trying to kiss him.  Even though there was strong evidence that proved he didn't do it, there was no chance for him because it was an all white jury.  In the end the jury convicted Tom Robinson and senteced him to life.  When it was time to put him away he dcided to run for it.  As he was running to get away a police officer shot him in the bak and killed him.  Atticus never won a case and they were all innocent, but he was the only one who could keep a jury in the deliberation room for that long, which was a tiny step closer to endind racism in the court when it came to innocent people.  That why I liked this book alt because he sttod up for what was right even though people hated him for.  Alot of people didn't like him for that reason, but many did respected him for trying. <br /> <br />
B00066R4T8|2.0|The problem with this book is it pales in comparison to many other adventure/survival stories, most notably another mountaineering debaucle \\"Into Thin Air.\\"  I'm sure if you are a climber the technical detail (ad nauseum) is riveting.  If you read these stories for inspiration and to attain some insight into the thrill-seeker mind, it will be a tough 218 pages to get through.

0385486804|4.0|This is an easy read, thanks to the Krakauer style.  He gives you the facts, backs them up with research, then leads your mind into the realm of \\"why.\\"  If you have young adult sons, especially those who follow a different path, it can provide some insight into their motivation, the events that shape their values and it may remind you that their thinking is sometimes unduly influenced by their lack of experience.  I was particularly struck by this young man's strong influence on those he encountered throughout his journey.  The story is at once heart-wrending and titillating.
B00003CWL6|1.0|Two stars for actor performances, the production work et al which is great.  However the true meat of a movie is the story and this was a case of chopped pork rather than loin.  Suburban bored miserable middle aged man, burned out wife who hates him, the terrible temptation he could not resist, disaster.  A plot found in a million books and a million magazines, not exactly ground breaking stuff. Not terrible just a little ordinary in my opinion and not really worth the effort.
0765309408|4.0|The Heinlein comparisons are apt, and complimentary.  This has obvious elements of Space Cadet and Starship Troopers, but it's not in any way derivative.   <br /> <br />In some ways, the story ends a bit too abruptly...really feels like the first portion of a larger story, and the sequel is already on the way.  But, no story elements are left unfinished, it's just clear this is a broader story line.  That's good and bad, as you definitely want more from this author, but I like a more closed feeling. <br /> <br />
B00005JO0J|1.0|Did we see the same movie? Talk about cliches. The Mal character <br />was a composite of Han Solo who was a cliche to begin with. This <br />is a really bad movie. I've never been so bored watching a movie.
B0001DMPVI|5.0|this is a great album that just grows and grows on you. <br />vastly underrated and overlooked. psychedelia at its finest!!
B000001ESP|5.0|\\"Moving Pictures\\" finds the band firing on all cylinders, delivering track after track of perfectly crafted and performed prog-rock goodness.  \\"Tom Sawyer\\" and \\"Limelight,\\" (one of the few near-perfect rock songs, in my opinion), deserve their status as classics, as does the frenetic instrumental \\"YYZ\\" which gives each member a chance to showcase their abundant chops.  The lesser-known but atmospheric \\"Witch Hunt\\" and the Police-inspired \\"Vital Signs\\" give the album different musical dimensions, but the high-point is the sprawling \\"Camera Eye,\\" Rush's last long prog epic. <br /> <br />The entire album is brilliantly conceived, musically and lyrically.  There are no slow spots and no filler; the whole album flows perfectly from start to finish, a main reason why it gets 5 stars (I usually don't give perfect reviews).  Alex, Geddy and Neil found their first true taste of mainstream success with this one, offering the perfect blend of challenging, yet accessible and radio-friendly music.  This is not to the album's detriment, however, as Rush always makes their music their way, the listening tastes of the public be damned; the two just happened to coincide in 1981.  Five stars all the way.  If you're curious to get into Rush, start here (I sure did!)  If you're a Rush fan, you already have this one.  Peace.
B00005JOGU|5.0|The most striking thing about this movie is Philip Seymour Hoffman's performance as Truman Capote.  For everyone out there who remembers how Capote acted, this performance is spot-on.  The story concerns the six years or so in which Capote wrote In Cold Blood.  This is a fascinating companion to that book and the two movie versions of it (there was a TV movie featuring Sam Neil).  The thing that always struck me as disingenuous about In Cold Blood is that Capote himself does not make an appearance, and yet he is such a player in the actual events of the case.  In this version, Capote takes center stage. <br /> <br />Of course, the famous story about the writing of this book is how Capote fell in love with one of the killers.  I have not read the book on which this movie is based, but the film shows Capote as both loving Perry Smith and wanting him to die to provide an ending for his book.  I do not know if Capote was quite as cruel in real life as he is portrayed in the film.  Yet this is a fascinating film which makes me want to re-read In Cold Blood. <br />
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|I cant believe they took this long, its crazy!  I have a feeling itll be worth the wait.

0449002632|5.0|London: The Novel takes us through twenty centuries of the history of the second millennium's greatest city. Rutherfurd uses the format he employed in Sarum, Russka and later in The Forest, and Princes of Ireland, wherein he follows the same families through centuries. These dozen or so chapters in London's history move us forward from Julius Caesar's invasion thru the coming of Christianity, the Saxon times and the Norman Conquest, the construction of the Tower of London, the reign of Henry II, the building of London Bridge, the Black Death, Henry VIII, the Reformation, the Elizabethan Age, the Civil War and Commonwealth, the eighteenth-century, the nineteenth, the rise of the Victorians, the world wars, and the arrival at this present time we can momentarily call the modern age. Rutherfurd's intricately-woven stories are excellent, and in many instances are told with a bawdiness left out in his other novels. Sometimes his plots are a bit like Chaucer's in their good natured perversity. But this is only true in a few places, mostly this is strong, serious storytelling that pilots a reader thru history and gives a good idea of how London came to be what it is today. Another nice feature of this book is that Rutherfurd imports characters from Sarum, so that we meet old friends again and discover branches of families from Wiltshire whose business and migrations have taken them to the capital. Later in the work I was impressed with the detail given to the trials and tribulations Londoners endured during the Blitz, when Nazi Germany did everything in its power to burn their home town to its foundations. I truly enjoyed reading London and found it  a lot of fun. Fans of Rutherfurd's past novels, those who enjoy history, or simply who appreciate a masterfully-crafted series of stories should like it, too.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|When I first heard about Joss Whedon doing a new series I was very excited and looked forward to it.  I actually never got a chance to see it on FOX. (Which is fine cause Rupert Murdoch is a tool).  A couple months ago I noticed it was playing on Sci-Fi and this time I DVR'd it.  First episode I watched was the second part of the pilot.  I wasn't drawn in, I didn't know the characters, didn't know it was the pilot and thought it moved kinda slow.  A couple weeks later my g/f tells me how good the Firefly show is and how glad she was I recorded it.  I watched another episode with her \\"Out of Gas\\" and I joined the browncoats.  I have to say that going back and seeing the pilot now I can't believe I didn't like it.  For all the people who saw an episode and didn't get it, give it another shot.  Try seeing the \\"Out of Gas\\" episode that gives a \\"how they met\\" backstory to the characters.   <br />I know that this series will be resurrected and can't wait.  Very impressed with Joss Whedon and the cast and crew of this show and movie.  Serenity rocks!
B00006690G|5.0|eminem really is one of the best rappers of all time. at first it seemed he was just a novelty act, sort of like nwa was seen when they first came on the scene in 89, but his second album threw those thoughts out the window with em's maturing art form. his third and strongest release, the eminem show, is the illmatic/36 chambers of this decade. it's incredibly varied with excellent production and ridiculously strong lyrics and messages. everything from the dr. dre produced \\"business\\", which is just straight up raw hip-hop at its best, to the emotional \\"sing for the moment\\" is captivating and entertaining in every way a piece of art should be. <br /> <br />em never falls short anywhere on the album, even the skits are funny and bring the album together better. even when em tries to sing on songs like \\"hailie's song\\" he's entertaining and touching at the same time. believe me, he's no ol' dirty at singing and rapping together, but his 1 time effort is still a good listen and it helps keep the album alive and versatile. <br /> <br />in the end this is one of my favorite albums of all time. if you cant enjoy eminem at this point in his career, I hate to say it, but you really are just hating on his skin color. eminem is ghostface, rakim, ice cube, nas, jay-z, biz markie and snoop all rolled into one, whiter package. get this album now.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|I think that naploean dynomite is the lowest form of comedy today. All it is is this looser who knows he is and says some dumb lines, and every one thinks this movie is good. Did i loose the point of the movie some where, or is this just stupid. when i saw it i thaught it was dumb to begin with. Whithin the first ten minutes i was about to go to sleep. So I give it a 1 out of 5 stars.<br /><br />~Goldpetal
B00019GG1M|5.0|This album is the first and possibly best album I have ever bought. I got it two years ago at HMV after falling in love with their first two singles.<br /><br />Someone claimed this album is pop. First of all, it's not. But second and more importantly, so what if one or two songs don't have intense drumming? The two softer, mellow songs bring balance to the album and make it the great album it is.<br /><br />Going Under: 5/5<br /><br />Bring Me to Life: 5/5<br /><br />Everybody's Fool: 3/5<br /><br />My Immortal: 5/5<br /><br />Haunted: 4/5<br /><br />Tourniquet: 5/5<br /><br />Imaginary: 4/5<br /><br />Taking Over Me: 3/5<br /><br />Hello: 5/5<br /><br />My Last Breath: 4/5<br /><br />Whisper: 10/5<br /><br />My Immortal (Band Version): 5/5<br /><br />Going Under and Whisper are the two darkest tracks on the album, with hard rock drumming and eerie vocals. They're also my two favorite tracks. I truly think Whisper is an amazing song. Tourniquet and Haunted are also dark, although I like Tourniquet more. It's about suicide and salvation with somewhat religious lyrics, but also very spooky.<br /><br />Bring Me to Life is what the band is known for, but it is by far the best song. The piano intro is haunting and mysterious, but I personally find the rapping in the chorus irritating.<br /><br />My Immortal itself is good, but the band version is even better with emphasized piano notes and drumming at the end, as opposed to the clean violin version. Hello is one of the saddest songs I've ever heard, and the melancholy it evokes is extremely powerful.<br /><br />This album has gotten me through bad times, and I don't know what life would have been like without it. I fell in love with the album the moment I put it in my CD player and this remains one of my favorite albums to date. I can only look forward to what their next album has to offer. But till then, I highly recommend Fallen!

B0002XVQNU|5.0|This is the version that should of been released in the theartres!!  Daredevil the directors cut is one of the best superhero movies ever, much more plot, more characters, and more action, just a great movie!! <br /> <br />
B000AP2ZLM|4.0|This is my first reveiw ever for Amazon- cool! Anyway, the same Crytopsy riffing and Lord Worm unique lyric writing style is back (no suprise really). The differences I heard really were just in the generous use of effects/synth orchestration, Lord Worm's vokill's didn't have that 'hollow' effect (he said in an interview I read one time that he couldn't get that sound anymore), and the lyrics weren't as gory (glad about that actually). I haven't accessed the extras yet, but as one reviewer said it doesn't have any video which sucks, but that's not why I gave it four stars. I gave it four stars 'cause while it shows the finer side of extreme metal (there's a finer side?), it's just more Cryptopsy power with, due to the conceptual nature of the songs, expanded width. It's worth getting for everyone into extreme metal (and some of those into new-school metalcore), but definitely for Cryptopsy fans.
B000AL730O|4.0|I totally don't agree that most of Paul McCartneys post Beatles music isn't any good!!  I became a McCartney fan because of Wings and his solo music, not because of the Beatles! <br /> <br />McCartneys career since the Beatles is filled with quality and a wonderful variety of styles!  Sure everything hasn't been earth shattering, but what artist every song has been?? <br /> <br />As for Chaos, it's a very good album that would of been even better if McCartney had used his band.  Even so Chaos contains some definite McCartney classics!!
B00004Y6NW|5.0|This is a great first album from Dire Straits. Anyone who's new <br />to Dire Straits should get this and Making Movies which go better <br />together. This is also a really great album to start a party too. <br />It starts Dire Straits with their first song ever, Down to the <br />Waterline which starts out quiet and then rocks with \\"Sweet surrender on the quayside, you remember you used to run and hide\\" <br />. It also has one of the number 1 Dire Straits songs ever, Sultans of Swing with \\"You get the shiver in the dark it's raining in the park meantime\\". Lions, the last track is probably <br />my favorite song on the entire CD saying \\"Bad sun, going down\\". <br />Then my other 3 favorites on this would be songs like Setting <br />Me Up, Six Blade Knife with \\"Six blade knife, do anything for you\\" and Southbound Again. Please ignore the 2 loud high voice songs and get this masterpiece.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|For me Depeche Mode's best years were between 1986-1998,in these years they've released their best albums including \\"Ultra\\" which for me is one of the best albums of any band I've ever heard.It seems that since \\"Ultra\\" something switched off.\\"Exciter\\" wasnt exciting at all but at least it had 2 or 3 good songs(\\"Freelove\\",\\"Shine\\").Now comes \\"Playing the angel\\" which was announced before it's release as their best since \\"Violator\\".Well,to be quite honest,this is even worse then \\"Exciter\\",I've been listening to all the songs for a few times and none of them draws my attention.The biggest mistake in this album is the misuse of Dave Gahan voice.Dave has a wonderful voice(again,see \\"Ultra\\")but in most of the songs here he is just screaming or sounds like he is talking from a telephone.It seems like \\"Depeche mode\\" is trying something different in each new album,while some people would like it,I for once think they should have continued with the same style as \\"Ultra\\" in their 2 previous albums. <br />I will not bother reviewing each single of \\"Playing the angel\\" becuase non of them stands out as being a really good song,none of them is really bad but most of them are simply empty and not catchy. <br />Bottom Line:\\"Playing the angel\\" is a big miss by my fav band in the world,all i can hope is that depeche mode still have in them the power to release one more good album before they retire.I'm waiting since \\"Ultra\\".
0440180295|3.0|Kurt Vonnegut is the novel's author and one of the main characters in the novel. In the first and last chapters, Vonnegut speaks about himself, the story he is writing, and what led him to write it.  <br /> <br />     The novel is a very satirical story about the bombing of Dresden by the British. It is clear that many of the war occurrences of Billy Pilgrim, the main character, are autobiographical in life. His appearance in the book complicates the plot and the point of view. Vonnegut himself was a prisoner of war during the firebombing of Dresden, and he occasionally inserts himself in the narrative. Kurt Vonnegut executes an odd, but creative way of authorial existence that reappears throughout the novel. Such examples of when Vonnegut appears and exists are when the novel mentions him or his idea particularly in the refrain \\"So it goes\\" that follows each reference of death. Vonnegut's commentary as a character and an author allows a more factual understanding of a story that seems supernaturally imaginary and adds structure to the idea that such fictional elements may be the reality of a disturbed mind.  <br /> <br />     Another large area of this book is based on the satire on society. One account of satire is how the Tralfamadorians, made up aliens in the mind of Billy Pilgrim, control how he thinks of death. Since the Tralfamadorians think of death as just a \\"state of being\\", Billy consists of that idea, too. It is almost as if death is made as a joke.  <br /> <br />     My overall opinion of this book is fair. This book can be very confusing to read. It jumps from subject to subject. Although the novel may seem out of order, it is very creative in showing the satirical realties in society. I suggest this book for readers interested in satirical novels who can be accepting to displaced ideas, yet creative thoughts social order.
B00012FXB8|4.0|There is an understandable tendency to view this as the least successful of the Alien series.  I think this is more due to its curious handling of the entire alien plotline which cheerfully combines the usual, 'alien chases humans who then chase it,' fare with a startling mystical vision.  There is a great deal of symbol dropping, but the references to biblical myth never quite gel.  Director David Finchley never quite overcomes the hurdles that this aspect of the film presents, but he actually does quite well with everything else, so the film really deserves a second chance.<br /><br />Stanza three of this tale finds us momentarily aboard Ripley's escape vessel, just long enough to become aware that there is an alien with them and to see the ship crash on yet another grim, unpleasant planet.  Ripley is the only survivor and finds that here rescuers are the remnants of a prison colony.  When this colony of double y chromosome criminals was closed several years before, a small group that had found some comfort chose to remain along with a two warders and the prison doctor.  A rescue ship is due for her 'sometime' but the prison's unrelieved post-modern gothic setting is poor comfort to Ripley in the meanwhile.<br /><br />This film makes no effort to hide the awful truth.  Even as Ripley cremates her fellow escapees, we get to watch the birth of yet another of mankind's nemeses in the endless bowels of the prison.  Once again, a hungry alien starts treating humans as snacks.  Ripley attempts to alert the wardens but all is useless.  Her only friends are Clemens (Charles Dance), the prison medic, and Dillon (Charles S. Dutton), the prisoner who doubles as one of the strangest religious leaders in interstellar space.  It isn't until it is clear that something awful is stalking the inmates that the cast settles down to fighting, running, and being munched.<br /><br />The story has quite a few twists as Ripley gradually realizes that the Alien is hardly the worst of her problems.  There are many opportunities for strong character acting and the cast makes the most of almost all of them.  Even the alien has it's moments.  With countless tunnels and dark corners the film has all the room it needs for plenty of action and the bloodthirsty won't feel the least bit disappointed.<br /><br />As I've already said Finchley has cast our hungry xenomorph as the Beast of the Apocalypse.  I can't say as how I blame him (the aliens do represent the end of life as humans think of it), but the imagery is so overstated that many viewers will be put off.  For one, I liked both the filmic and musical moments that were so redolent of monastic appearances.  But, while they added atmospheric depth, they never really advanced the plot, which focused more on the countless acts of heroism that made up the prisoner's defensive efforts.  For being society's dregs, they will quickly win your sympathy.opportunities for strong character acting and the cast makes the most of almost all of them.  Even the alien has it's moments.

B00005JO0J|4.0|A bit of warning about the review below. In life this reviewer is a real straight shooter, I'm blunt and I'll tell it how it is from my point of view. Like it or not that's up to you. But if you want a fluffy review look elsewhere. <br /> <br />I watched \\"Firefly\\" when it first premiered and didn't like it. I just didn't get it and went back to watching \\"Angel\\". I maybe watched one more episode before it got cancelled and then got ambushed by some of my friends that did get hooked while it aired. <br />So i bought the DVD set and that's when I finally loved it. <br />And I'll tell the initiated, those who look upon us Browncoats with disdain, not getting why we dress up in our \\"Browncoats\\" and use out of date slang and chinese swears, it's because when you've watched the whole dvd set you see the love that was put into the series.  <br />Most people in the film biz are in it for the cold hard cash. Everyone from the coffee fetcher and up. <br />Very few are in it for the love of the craft. And to collect a cast and crew that fall in love with the story and their characters- even the chinese slang that was so easy to botch, it's reflected on the screen. And that's why we love Joss. Because he knows how to radiate it from the words on up to the music. It makes his star, Nathan Fillion nerdy in love with the music. <br />With that said, this film isn't for everyone. It's science fiction folks. The reason movies like \\"Star Wars\\" do so well is because their made for the masses. Ol' bell curved masses.  <br />Am I being derogatory? Hell yes. Anyone who works retail begins to deeply dislike the rude frothing masses. So fine, I can understand that some of you aren't going to get this movie, aren't going to get why great authors like Orsen Scott Card will tap dance the theme because he loves it so much (ah, just kidding I don't know if he can tap dance. But if he could...). <br /> <br />And now here's the part where I have to comment on why I feel the movie doesn't earn it'sfifth star. <br />This is actually Joss' first direction of a motion picture, which might suprise the folks out there, and there is a hell of a difference between directing television and a movie. With that said even the untrained eye could spot several first time out mistakes. Which I'm not going into because this is a review and not a disertation and dissection. <br />Also the cut scenes- the ones that explain Inara's place in the story. Seriously 7-10 more minutes wasn't going to break the story! I really can find no fault when the iniatiated ask me about \\"Mal's Girlfriend\\". I really hope they'll be on the DVD. <br /> <br />Another point of contention, when a crew memeber dies and only Mal and Zoe witness it, the audience is left shaken and then a little pissed that there's barely any time or emotion shed for the dead. \\"Serenity\\" goes too subtle for the iniatiated. You'd have to have watched the series to know that Zoe was career Military. That she is trained to bottle up her feelings. It isn't until the battle that some of us can pick up that she doesn't want to live anymore and that's when she's hurt badly. Again the movie asks for your full atention and that's something for the masses that can be hard to give. <br /> <br />Other than what's stated above, that the movie was really everything that I wanted in \\"Serenity\\". It's just a good movie. It's not the best ever, but it's the best out this year. It's a credit to the Science Fiction community, however lukewarm they may be to us. <br /> <br />Thank you for your time.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Hidden from Knowledge, Mysterious, this album is Dark, and Beautiful. It's amazing how these guys still have the flair of being able to put melodic tunes when they come together. There is not a  legitimate argument regarding their rendition for anyone to make the compare their work prior to Playing The Angel, each recording has it's bright moments. Playing the Angel is graceful, inspiring it takes me back to my roots takes me back  to my foundation of my making.  Not fair for me to describe to you  each track. I invite you to listen to it couple of times before you make any judgments.<br /><br />I Disagree with Tammy La Gorce I don't think there are any \\"Clunkers\\" on this  recording. Have fun !!!

B00006AW2G|5.0|I am not a Rolling Stones fanatic.  In fact, this is the only album of theirs I own, and often when I hear some of their other songs on the radio I change the station.<br /><br />But \\"Let it Bleed\\" is a great album.  The friend who introduced it to me was convinced it was actually a greatest hits collection, and it often feels like it.  Every song is good, great even, although not every song is \\"Written by Mick Jagger & Keith Richards\\" as the liner notes claim: everyone knows \\"Love in Vain\\" is a Robert Johnson tune, though the Rolling Stones do cover it well here.  Some of the songs have a blues feel, others feel like a country bar, and others are nothing but rock and roll anthems, and good ones.  Instrumentation includes harp, piano, mandolin, slide guitar, fiddle, horns, and a boys choir, and the sound is always fluid and bold and energetic.<br /><br />The songs include the frantic, lightning-filled \\"Gimme Shelter,\\" the friendly \\"Let it Bleed,\\" and the sad yet hopeful \\"You Can't Always Get What You Want.\\"<br /><br />This is the Rolling Stones for people who don't neccesarily even like the Rolling Stones.  This is classic rock for people who might even hate that term.  This is just good music, and it's well deserving of its reputation, and well worth buying.<br /><br />Buy it used, though--these guys have enough money, and they take just a little too much pleasure in sueing anyone that samples even a single note of their music.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|One of the great things about Clapton has always been his willingness to share his personal life with his fans through his music.  When he was battling a heroine addiction, he recorded 461 Ocean Boulevard that included `Mainline Florida.'  When his son was tragically killed, he shared `Tears in Heaven' on the soundtrack to the movie Rush and `The Circus Left Town' on Pilgrim.  Clapton's tune may have changed on Back Home, but his proclivity to offer a perspective into his own world has not.<br /><br />In the liner notes, Clapton includes in his dedication, \\"Most of all, I want to thank my wife and children for providing for me, with love and care, the home I have always yearned for, and will always hurry back to.\\"  So, if there had been any doubt, Back Home is the next chapter in Clapton's musical autobiography.  In this installment, Clapton finds the love and family that he believes has eluded him until now, and, the listener need look no further than the first cut, `So Tired' for confirmation.  Not only does Clapton croon lines like, \\"The baby's already feeding, the other one is teething\\" and \\"I just can't wait until the sun's gone down, and all the kids have gone to bed,\\" but he also includes \\"baby sounds,\\" laughing, gurgling, and so forth on the track.  In `Run Home To Me' Clapton laments the good times are good but far too infrequent:<br /><br />I walked down to the water with my love and my baby.<br /><br />Watched the waves breaking in and enjoying the view.<br /><br />And I heard myself saying, \\"We should do this more often.\\"<br /><br />Watch the little ones playing on that bright stony shore,<br /><br />And I wish deep down in my heart we could stay here forever.<br /><br />And, these sweet simple moments never come back no more.<br /><br />Clapton penned six of the 12 songs on Back Home, and other songwriters like Stevie Wonder, George Harrison, Doyle Bramlett II, and Vince Gill also contributed and provided some variety to the CD.  Still, many of Clapton's songs have familiar chords and at least parts of some melodies.  There are a number of examples of some musical recycling.  `Say What You Will' and `Revolution' are written the Reggae rhythm reminiscent of `I Shot The Sheriff.'  Parts of the melody for `Run Home To Me' are similar to `You Were There' from Pilgrim.  Other aspects of that familiar musical style, however, like the Hammond organ and the guitar solo on `One Day' remind the listener that Clapton is still Clapton.<br /><br />In spite of what can be considered mostly unremarkable, adult contemporary songs, it is evident that Clapton is very comfortable in his own musician's skin.  He does not push to make a song something that it's not.  Although vocally Clapton has a warm, comfortable style, he is limited in his range and he realizes that fact.  His guitar virtuosity is not overdone; rather it nicely complements the other musicians, who are as usual, exceptional.  Recognizable names like bassist Nathan East, who has recorded with E.C. for about 20 years beginning with the LP August, Grammy winner Billy Preston, Doyle Bramlett II, Andy Fairweather Low, and percussionist Steve Gadd complete the foundation of Clapton's band.  Other contributors include Chris Stainton, Steve Winwood, Stephen Marley, Vince Gill, and The Kick Horns.<br /><br />While Clapton did not really break any new musical ground with Back Home, it is certainly better than 99.9% of the music (if it can be called that) being produced today.  After all, it IS Clapton.  There are not any hits, but there really does not need to be.  This chapter of Clapton's life in music is well produced and enjoyable for any Clapton aficionado or anyone who wants to hear a living musical treasure.

0385513755|5.0|Dan Brown's flow and style of writing has to be a couple of the many unique features of this most excellent thriller of a book.  The \\"Da Vinci Code\\" has something for everyone from suspense, drama, action, and romance, to major controversy.  The topic of conflict gives a different idea of the Holy Grail.  The book clearly states that it's the resting place of Mary Magdalene, Jesus' secret lover(from the books point of view), but it could be the Cup of Christ or even His blood.<br /><br />  Brown's writings are quite historically accurate with everything in his novel.  All the groups involved like Opus Dei and the locations of everything like famous churches and former Templar churches are very correct.  The Da Vinci Code also tests the bloodline of Christ.  The text shows a possibility of there being relatives of Jesus still alive today!  The plot of this book and how plausible everything involved in it really can add to the excitement and creates an easy distraction to get away from the world for a while.
B000ASATWQ|4.0|This is a great cd, IM a reggae fan and like listening to it but I dont have to many reggae cds to be honest! but this is a strong cd song for song with many styles on it, I would say if you are on the fence and dont know what cd to buy than this is the one you want to get if you want a reggae cd.
B000000H40|5.0|I wrote a review a long time ago for this album, but I didn't explain much, so heres a better review, this is a classic album, Slowly We Rot was nice and raw, also a classic, this is more cleaned up, evovled, more breakdowns and all that good stuff, fast *breakdown* fast...the normal Metal formula, lots of Thrash riffs being thrown around here, Tardys vocals are even better here, louder, and can make them out even more, (one of my favorite vocalists), the riffs are catchy as hell, some fast, some slow, nice variety, the soloing, I shouldn't need to explain much on this, after all, it's James Murphy, I also like Allen West too though, but you can't deny that James Murphy is a killer guitarist, great drumming out of Donald also, and can be heard alot better than on Slowly We Rot, the production is more cleaned up than Slowly We Rot, so it's got a better sound, not too raw, but not too clean either, which means not overly done, like some albums. <br /> <br />Infected 5/5, A nice fast paced opener, wicked riffs being thrown around, and hearing Tardy screaming \\"INNFECTEEEEED!\\" rules <br /> <br />Body Bag 5/5, More nice riffs around here, slows down in spots, other spots, nice and fast <br /> <br />Chopped In Half 5/6, CLASSIC, mostly an instrumental, BUT, I still consider it a song, seeing how it has vocals, killer riffs, and soloing...FEEL THE BLOOD SPILL FROM YOUR MOUUUUUTH! <br /> <br />Circle of the Tyrants 5/5, Everyone has covered this it seems, but, this is a very nice cover of it, the original is great too <br /> <br />Dying 5/5, Not much to say, nice riffing/soloing <br /> <br />Find The Arise 5/6, ANOTHER classic, love the way it starts out with that explosion sound, STOP! FIND THE ARISE, KILL AT FIRST SITE!...love the way it ends too, and goes into the title track... <br /> <br />Cause of Death 5/6. Yet another classic, as I said, The end of Find The Arise works into this, wicked riffs in here, soloing, and as always, killer vocals by Tardy <br /> <br /> <br />Memories Remain 5/5, Not much to say here, once again, nice riffing and soloing, love the outro, and hearing Tardy scream at the top of his lungs <br /> <br />Turned Inside Out 5/5, WICKED CLOSER!, AWESOME HEAVY RIFFING, nice variety also, just a killer song all around... <br /> <br />Well, there it is, I didn't mention much about the drumming, because I shouldn't need to, it's Donald Tardy, if you liked Slowly We Rot...or if you've never heard that, and like Celtic Frost, Check out Obituary, and for ones that HAVE heard Slowly We Rot, get this, I'm sure you won't be dissapointed, also check out The End Complete, World Demise, and their new one Frozen in Time!, very nice comeback, Avoid Back from the Dead at all costs though, later! <br /> <br />
0515125024|5.0|Jack Reacher is a huge, well muscled construction of anomalies. He is, certainly, a highly skilled ex-Military Policeman. He lacks the wisecracks of Paul Brenner, DeMille's ex-military cop (The General's Daughter; Up Country), for which this reviewer is grateful. He travels alone, supplementing his discharge settlement from the Army with a number of odd jobs, doorman, pool digger, body guard.<br /><br />Here he is walking on the Chicago streets when he sees Holly Johnsen, on crutches, struggling with her dry cleaning. Of course, it probably helps that despite the crutches, Holly is a drop dead fox.<br /><br />As he goes to assist the damsel in distress, she is grabbed by thugs and in what can only be termed only as an error of judgment of monumental proportions on their part, so is he. Not surprisingly, all hell breaks loose. Retribution may not be swift but you can count on Mr. Child. It is brutal.<br /><br />Lee Child does a great job with the 'man with no name' analogy, and the stories have developed their own cult following. There is a repetitive criticism that Reacher gets involved with these crimes by \\"coincidence.\\" Seeing a damsel in distress. Protecting an aging blues singer on the comeback trail. Seeing a restaurant owner shaken down by Eastern European hoods. Being picked up while hitchiking by a woman with no where to go. Rubbish.<br /><br />One of the greatest directors ever, Hitchcock, loved the \\"coincidental\\" irony in his protagonists getting caught up with life and death situations. See L.B. Jefferies, photographer, in \\"Rear Window.\\" Then see Roger O. Thornhill, advertising agent in \\"North By Northwest.\\" What a great way to start a story.<br /><br />Keep up the great work Mr. Child. 5 stars. Larry Scantlebury

B00000IFP6|5.0|I was curious to listen to David Zinman and the Zurich Orchestra after all I had read in  the CD guide books and magazines. This is my sixth full cycle (Karajan 1963 and 1977, Klemperer,Bernstein/VPO and Toscanini) and these days is definetely my favourite. Zinman brings new life to the symphonies- period. The Barenreiter edition may play a role in the freshness of the music but the passion of maestro and orchestra makes you feel as if you are present in the music hall, being a spectator of a live performance.<br />The first symphonies were the greatest surprise for me, and I can now see the maturation of Beethoven, where as the older approaches interepreted these pieces as small \\"Eroicas\\". There is no doubt there are better interepretations of individual symphonies out there - ex. Carlos Kleiber on the 5th, Klemperer on the \\"Eroica\\"-old style or Furtwangler on the 1952 recording of the \\"Choral\\" - but this fact can not overshadow what I find as an excellent set at a great price.
B00009V8Z9|5.0|I am very discerning about the music that I choose as \\"favorite\\" or otherwise. This is by far one of my favorite CD, and I have many. Gavin Degraw's voice is unbelievable! He's got great range and tone, plus you can really feel the emotions behind the lyrics that he's singing. If asked to pick a favorite song on this album, I'd find it more than difficult. I've had this CD for over a year now and still listen to it regularly. If you are looking for a CD that has most, if not, all the human emotions you should definitely try Gavin Degraw's Chariot.

Anyone who doesn't like this CD must not like good music. I also recommend music from these groups: (The Offspring, Blink 182)
0375507256|2.0|I strongly agree with the above reviewer who discovered to his / her dismay that the numerous character's and stories in Cloud Atlas, while intrigueing and often amusing . . . do not ultimately have much of a purpose other than showing off a \\"revolutionary\\" new style of writing a novel. Although I enjoyed some of the stories and found the writing entertaining, I reached a point of saturation early on, and had to force myself to read further.
B000002WPI|5.0|along with Dr. Dre's The Chronic, the Wu-Tang Clan's debut, Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers), was one of the most influential rap albums of the '90s. its spare yet atmospheric production -- courtesy of RZA -- mapped out the sonic blueprint that countless other hardcore rappers would follow for years to come. it laid the groundwork for the rebirth of New York hip-hop in the hardcore age, paving the way for everybody from Biggie and Jay-Z to Nas and Mobb Deep. moreover, it introduced a colorful cast of hugely talented MCs, some of whom ranked among the best and most unique individual rappers of the decade. some were outsized, theatrical personalities, others were cerebral storytellers and lyrical technicians, but each had his own distinctive style, which made for an album of tremendous variety and consistency. every track on Enter the Wu-Tang is packed with fresh, inventive rhymes, which are filled with martial arts metaphors, pop culture references (everything from Voltron to Lucky Charms cereal commercials to Barbra Streisand's \\"The Way We Were\\"), bizarre threats of violence, and a truly twisted sense of humor. their off-kilter menace is really brought to life, however, by the eerie, lo-fi production, which helped bring the raw sound of the underground into mainstream hip-hop. starting with a foundation of hard, gritty beats and dialogue samples from kung fu movies, RZA kept things minimalistic, but added just enough minor-key piano, strings, or muted horns to create a background ambience that works like the soundtrack to a surreal nightmare. there was nothing like it in the hip-hop world at the time, and even after years of imitation, Enter the Wu-Tang still sounds fresh and original. subsequent group and solo projects would refine and deepen this template, but collectively, the Wu have never been quite this tight again.

B000001GLK|5.0|This is how the Beethoven concertos should be played - with majesty and grandeur. After buying this Pollini recording, I find other recordings lacking in these aspects. If you are going to buy one recording of the concertos, this should be it. The live aspect, I think, is not really noticeable. Maybe one or two audience coughs but that is to be expected. These interpretations of Pollini are too good to turn down based on the fact that it's a live recording. This set includes the DEFINITIVE recording of the 4th Concerto. I challenge anyone to find a better performance. Pollini knows Beethoven, trust me. I've listened to over 20 different interpretations and in my opinion Pollini's performances here come the closest to the composer's intentions. The Berlin Philharmonic does an excellent job with the accompaninent as well. Not to be missed!
1400034779|4.0|While I thoroughly enjoyed this book and I don't understand the reason why people have praised it to the skies. It is a simple good book and has all the elements in it that make it a fun read. It is well written, and you really get a true feel for all the characters in the book. The mysteries are interesting and are a joy to watch unfold. Another great part of the book is the way the author weaves the african culture into the book without it being very in-your-face. The book also kind of reminded me of \\"things fall apart\\"... same kind of tone of writing making it easy to read, yet driving home a point. Once again, like I said I really did enjoy the book, but may had a little more if it wasn't for all the hype surrounding it. Am giving it 4 stars and not 5, just for that.
B00005K9QP|5.0|Clapton is God: This was the grafitti at the time. No other guitar player was called God... except maybe Jimi Hendrix...  <br />About the importance of the record, reviewer Chuck Voellinger says it all. <br />Anyone who ever laid hands on a guitar should study this record first. It's essential, although I think the album Layla is Clapton at his best ever.  <br /> <br />
B000AY74OG|5.0|OK, It's really creative, I must say. I like it because all of the character has a each different personalities. I love it. It's real funny! I give an extra point because the character of human and the animals are mixed together. I must say it is really kinda unique. The plot is also good, even Magadascar in the real world is very different than in this DVD. But It's OK, because it's cartoon. I don't know why, maybe the cast of each character. Each character's really different personality make this DVD is very interesting. They all have different personalities, but the same thing about them is they love each other. I like Gloria's personality, she's big, but she's very funny. Score 9.4. :)
B000A0GP4K|5.0|If you're a Dylan fan, buy this. It's what we - people who can't stand to hear someone say, Dylan can't sing, etc - have been waiting for. It's really cool. Don't Look Back is also an important film, but it just shows Dylan how he was. Here we get the why he was. Great presentation, great direction by Scorsese, nice bonus features, Dylan becomes more human and less of a mysterious and distant persona. (I have seen him live twice, and it was more than alright!) <br />It's almost 4 hours long too! <br />I understand why it focuses only on the sixties period but it's one thing I didn't like. Dylan made great music after that, like Blood on the Tracks.  <br />
B00079FUI6|5.0|This one is very funny and ... it's very (100x) good! It's really a real housewife, and it's very interesting. It's the best movie EVER!!    You can see everybody's personality. It's like our own life, isn't it?   Mrs. Van Der Kamp(my favourite), she is a very perfect woman. She check every details. (Marcia Cross is doing very good). But, her own marriage is in danger.  Lynette is a almost stressed woman. Her sons are very hyperactive!   Susan is a woman who looked for someone to live with. She has a clever daughter.  Gabrielle is a cheating woman.  Every personality make this movie very interesting.  It's like a real world. I love it very much!  Highly Recommended. Score 9.8.
B00005JO0J|5.0|When \\"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\\" came out it got bad reviews at first because it broke away from standard Western conventions.  The same thing is happening with Serenity for the same reason.  Sci-fi geeks who like Star Wars... Trek... whatever, really don't seem to understand that Serenity is NOT some geeky sci-fi dreck that depends on technobabble and implausible \\"aliens\\" (Trek) or flashy special effects combined with cardboard characters and a boring story (Wars).  Unfortunately, because they don't understand the movie, they seem compelled to write bad reviews.  Folks, Serenity has more in common with great films like \\"Butch Cassidy\\", \\"The English Patient\\", \\"Chariots of Fire\\", \\"The Interpreter\\", (the original) \\"The Manchurian Candidate\\", \\"Some Like it Hot\\", \\"Captain Blood\\" and other such films than it has with sci-fi geek films like the Star Dreck stuff.  In case you can't tell, I am not a sci-fi fan.  But I like great movies.  If you, like me, prefer the movies I've named above to Star whatever, then you'll also like Serenity - and you should go see it.  If you are a sci-fi geek, I feel sorry for you because you probably lack the broad-based film viewing background to understand what the film is doing - please don't go to see it.  It'll confuse you.
B00005JNJV|4.0|It is great to finally see Hollywood stay pretty close to the actual darkness and storyline of a character as he was originally written.<br /><br />The Batman of the 1930-1940s was not the campy characters often seen in the 1960-1970s TV series.<br /><br />There are a few moments of humor in this movie, but not the usual comic farse Hollywood seems to throw into everything they make these days.<br /><br />This Batman is about as close to authentic as we can probably ever expect from any major studio.<br /><br />True, there are some minor complaints and areas where the film could have been improved upon, but this would be nitpicking.<br /><br />The one MAJOR NEGATIVE in this film is Katie Holmes !!!<br /><br />Ugghhh.... what terrible casting.<br /><br />It is hard to imagine how the Casting Dept chose her for this role.<br /><br />Her screen presence is bad, she does not fit the role, her acting is below par compared to other actors on the screen and there is ZERO chemistry between her and Christian Bale.<br /><br />An actress like a Naomi Watts or Kate Beckinsale would have been much better in that role !
B000B2YQX4|1.0|Playing the Angel would be a good album if it was genuine. Genuine in the sense that Dave and Martin really felt as dejected as they did when they wrote \\"Leave in Silence\\" in 1982. But since this is obviously NOT the case (the DM members are no longer 20 years old anymore, and have no reason to whine unless it's about their waning fanbase that was once as big as U2's), somebody needs to give this album the rating it deserves so DM know to stop the cliches. Just because you get SOMETHING from one of your favorite bands doesn't mean you have to praise it like it's the fu*cking Holy Scripture, which Martin has LOVED to make \\"pained\\" references to since before Violator. Playing the Angel too uncreative to be so theatrical. Dave sounds like he's an aspiring Broadway hack of an actor, and Martin writes like he's his playwright dog. Depeche Mode are a joke now. On the One Night in Paris DVD, a fat and shirtless David Gahan \\"treated\\" (i.e. grossed out) viewers by prancing around like would do fifteen years earlier. The difference is he didn't have love handles and excess body hair back then. DM are now just a faux-piss party attempting to pander their outdated and stale wares to kids who are too young to even know Depeche Mode exists. The audience DM are going for listen to screaming EMO crap from boys who are so young they've barely \\"dropped\\", if you get my drift. And yet Depeche Mode are continuing merrily along the trail of Identity Crisis. Like previous reviewers have said: this IS 2005.
B0000C8AV3|4.0|Infidels took me a few listens to fully appreciate, but now I really love it and listen to it often. Of course, it doesn't compare to the heights of Blood on the Tracks or Desire, nor is it as stunning as the subsequent Oh Mercy, but it is a fine album that makes a very enjoyable listen. Right from the opening song, the excellent Jokerman, you realize that this is going to be a bit different from Dylan's usual sound. However, Dylan has reinvented his sound so many times that he really can't be said to have a distinctive sound. With its Caribbean rhythm, Jokerman is a distinctive song in Dylan's oeuvre. I particularly like that little bass thing right before the chorus kicks in. Another thing I like about this album is the \\"rambling\\" songwriting style. On songs such as Jokerman, Dylan just seems to ramble on and on about these completely unrelated scenarios and you often have no clue what he's talking about. That's not a criticism though, I find it very interesting. You never know what he's going to talk about next. There is a bit of political content here, yes, but I really don't think of Infidels as a political album. I think it's more cynical than political. I think Dylan is basically saying that the world sucks, and he wishes to wash his hands of it. Whether or not this is from a religious perspective is debatable. There are certainly religious references here, but they're not blatant like on Slow Train Coming and Saved. To be honest, I'm not quite sure what most of these songs are about. A couple are pretty obvious, such as Union Sundown and License to Kill, but I don't have a clue as to what Jokerman or I and I are about. It's okay though, Dylan doesn't often spell out the meaning of his songs. The music is great with Dylan getting support from Dire Strait's Mark Knopfler and former Rolling Stone Mick Taylor. Just like on the earlier Slow Train Coming, Knopfler's guitar is a musical highlight of the album. The rhythm section consisting of Robbie Shakespeare and Sly Dunbar is very tight as well. Excellent bass and drum work.<br /><br />To get the complete picture, be sure to pick up The Bootleg Series Volume 1-3 which features several songs that were cut from the album. Those songs are just as good as the ones on the album, if not better. Particularly Blind Willie McTell, which any Dylan fan should hear as it is one of his finest songs. Foot of Pride and Lord Protect My Child are also great songs that were recorded for Infidels but left off. Of course, people will always say that Infidels would have been a much better album with these tracks included, but it's really pointless. Just appreciate the album for what it is, not for what it could have been. The missing tracks are all available now anyway so with the proper technology you could reconstruct the \\"better\\" version of the album if you so desire.<br /><br />Infidels is one of Dylan's best albums of the 1980s. The songs are memorable and the music is great, even though the drums sometimes have that annoying 80s echo that I dislike. The lyrics are potent, the band is great and Bob's singing is quite good, though his lovely '70s voice was gone by this point. I wouldn't recommend it to a beginner, but if you're looking to explore Dylan's later years, Infidels is a great album to check out.Sly Dunbar is very tight as well. Excellent bass and drum work.

This can be a little depressing but reading about the actual character makes this book great.<br /><br />It was one of those books that you can't put it down.

B00005JNQA|5.0|Other reviewers have synopsized the plot, while giving away key twists...I will say instead:  the DVD was so good, it was viewed in succession by several people I know, with each viewer in turn commenting on how incredible a movie it was...it literally kept us on the edges of our seats... not wanting to pause or look away. Terrific acting... suspenseful... definately worth seeing again.
B0006IIPIK|4.0|This movie was not for everyone, apparently.  It was visually absolutely stunning - everything blended so seamlessly - I forgot all about the CGI plenty of times. Kerry Conran and his brother are highly talented. This was obviously a labor of love.  However, I'd say it always was fated to have a small audience, which is a pity.  I thought the whole retro concept was fabulous. Made me feel I was a little kid - seeing a movie like this for the first time. It's that kind of movie.
B000001DWG|5.0|Dudes, it's all subjective, so just cool your jets, ya know?  You're all biased in one way or another, no need to get all worked up about it.  Wood and Vedder are both cool in my book, and more famous than any of us will ever be, so really we're just voiceless in this debate...
0767834739|3.0|I don't usually go in for zombie movies, but I did see the first one and didn't hate it.  I liked this one much better than the first one mostly because of the action and the interaction between the characters.  I liked the fact that the women kick ass and I'm a sucker for Oded Fehr ever since The Mummy movies.  And, well, Mila may be a skinny-ass model, but she's highly likeable just as in The Fifth Element.  The movie does seem to set up for yet another chapter in the Resident Evil saga, but I think it's highly unlikely that there will be one.
B000B2YQX4|3.0|Following the after-hours ambience of the ironically-titled Exciter, Depeche Mode return with a distorted, industrial sound, recalling earlier classics like The Dead of Night, Barrel of a Gun, and I Feel You. Though the relaxed, down-tempo Exciter was a progression into new territory, Playing the Angel is a conscious retreat. This time Dave Gahan has managed to do what Alan Wilder never could, get more than 2 of his songs on a DM release, and--like Wilder's infrequent contributions--his material deserves to be heard. I liked DM better before they started making purely serious albums in the mid nineties. The best tracks here (Precious and Suffer Well) combine their emotional anguish with their innate dance-pop sensibilities, and should remind the band that they don't need to be heavy to be good.
0440241413|5.0|I quite enjoyed this book, it was funny, understandable, kept you hooked. There are a few spots in this book where it seemed like something was lacking, i can't quite figure out what, and it left you unsatisfied. despite the flaw I still gave it 5 stars because i am going to read the sequel and I would reccomend it to you!
B0001XAOLQ|5.0|\\"This is Lieutenent Werner, war correspondent.\\" So says the U-boat's Captain to his second officer, amidst all the noise of a nightclub, as the latter tries to steady himself at attention. \\"He'll ship out with us. He'll report the true facts---life on a submarine.\\"  And it's through these eyes, figuratively speaking (Lieut. Werner does not speak to us or speak over the film), that we are taken on a journey through the atlantic's stormy waters, and to its depths.  I've gone along for the ride over a dozens times thus far and have enjoyed this film with each viewing.  Concerning the 3 versions available: If you're having movie night with some friends and want an enjoyable action adventure---very realistic depth charge explosives rocking this German sub (as well as your living room, if you have a surround sound system especially) then the original version will suit you well.  This shortest version has a rather fast pace wherein something always is happening of a threatening nature, to either the sub itself or to the convoy freighters that the Germans are attempting to sink.  The director's cut, in contrast, is about 50% longer and, as such, has a somewhat slower pace; as does this complete uncut version that was initially broadcast in Germany as an almost 6 hour mini-series.  (Incidentially, the first 2 versions are simply edited versions of the latter one.)  Owing to its lenth, I can understand how one would prefer one of the abbreviated versions (and I sometimes watch the director's cut for this reason myself), but when I want to really get immersed (pardon the pun) in this story I reach for this uncut version.  For in this version it is far easier to feel aboard this sub as we watch the crew, like Lieutenent Werner does, with absorbing eyes; as they come alive to go on the attack, race to assume battle stations, rally in the face of death to save their craft when attacked themselves, or slumber/write/eat/sing/daydream of home.  And one gets a lot more of the latter activities in this uncut version, giving us the closest experience most of us will ever get of being aboard a submarine.  The lighting, the realism, the acting, the dialogue, the direction, you name it, everything about this film is consistantly superior to any other war film I've seen; and most other dramas as well.  It is, in short, one of the finest efforts presented on film.  I hope I have been of some help herein persuading you to consider seeing this motion picture in its full-lenth, most effective, form. (Unless you're 100% allergic to subtitles I recommend viewing the director's & uncut versions in the original German; and preferably on an otherwise quiet eve, in the dark, if you want to get the full import of this absorbing film.) Cheers!activities in this uncut version, giving us the closest experience most of us will ever get of being aboard a submarine.

B000002ADT|5.0|THIS is GREAT music! Most of the other jazz cd's I listen to are simply boring, repetitive and WAY overrated but this is certainly a classic recording.  <br /> <br />I do agree with one of the reviewer's that this is an essential recording that needs to be in all music fans collections right alongside Elvis, Frank, Ella, Ray, Bing, Chuck, BB, Muddy, Sam, Otis and a few others.
068987474X|3.0|This book is good, but IMHO it's more suitable to teenagers who start dating. I do not say that women don't need this, we may do, but most of us have been familiar with the cases mentioned (and the advice given). Greg and Liz's humorous style in writing is fun anyway (as if they could read my mind). This book is perfect to motivate people whose a bad relationship and don't know how to leave it. Also good to help us checking our (should be) good relationship... We, women, deserve to be appreciated, and if there are men who don't follow the rules, why do we have to keep them around? :)
0452281881|5.0|The London arm of Millers Shanks, an international advertising agency, is trying to land the Coca-Cola account.  Through a series of e-mails, we get to see the entire process, including the in-house romances, the back-stabbing, the ineptness of some in upper management, the gossip.  Author Matt Beaumont has created a juicy and comic novel about life behind the scenes, and even more amazing, it's told completely via e-mail.  At first glance, you may think this would make the storytelling more difficult, but after a few pages, you pick up on personalities and quirks and soon forgetting that the book is a series of emails.  Wonderful characters, a great story, a fantastic novel.

B000BB1MIC|5.0|First, note to John Q Public: even you are entitled to your opinion, however uninformed and -- let's just say it -- STUPID it is. We got it. You despise GG. So why are you wasting your time posting on this page? And you allude to things/characters on the show (even though what you stated is erroneous) so you must be watching at least some episodes to form your misguided opinions. And I find that even more confusing. You post your negative opinions about a show you allegedly hate, yet you somehow watch it. Hmmmmm.<br /><br />As for the rest of us who looooove the show, I think seasons 4 (even though I'm in the minority) and 5 have been the absolute best. It's faltering right now in the beginning of season 6 IMO but I will hang in there. Afte all, season 4 started out a bit odd, it finished with a bang and a kiss (the latter between L and L). And the extras on the DVD set look great -- finally, commentaries from the Palladinos!

B000031XCR|5.0|Why use many words on this CD. When the words stop, the music begins. The little  thing that  matters, the heart will always tell the truth. That`s the power of love. Thats the power of Celine. Therefore she sells tons of records. Damm the intellectual critics. They can have their bla,bla, words for introvert analyses. This one goes directly to your heart. Thanks Celine. You give us the truth that matter.  Shout it loud folks:THERES`ONE TROUGH EMOTION THAT REMINDS WE ARE THE SAME ( I really missed the song Let`s talk about love on this CD, but othervice great).
B000AMJG4Y|5.0|Let me first say that I am only marginally familiar with some of the characters: Cloud, Tifa, Aeris, and Sephiroth but know nothing of what has gone before AC because I have NEVER played any of the FF games, VII or otherwise. <br />That said, I TOTALLY LOVED THIS MOVIE.
B000001FS6|5.0|For some reason,people seem to have a problem with Rattle & Hum-the album & the movie.I don't get it.Recently,I went to a U2 fan site and there was a favorite album poll,Rattle & Hum recieved NO votes.I was like,what the? <br />Now,for the record,my favorite U2 album is Achtung Baby,but R&H is pretty close,in my opinion. <br />These people who hate this album,evidently,they must have forgotten that All I Want Is You,one of the most beautiful and lyrically interesting love songs ever is on it. <br />You say you'll give me a highway with no one on it <br />Treasure just to look upon it <br />All the riches in the night <br />You say you'll give me eyes on a moon of blindness <br />A river in a time of dryness <br />A harbour in the tempest <br /> <br />They also forgot the funky collabration with B.B.King-When Love Comes To Town or the passionate performances on songs like Heartland,God Part II,Silver & Gold,Helter Skelter(yeah,yeah,yeah,I know its a Beatles song),& Hawkmoon 269. <br />Anyone who loves their music raw,emotional,and real will love this album. <br />
B000002H6C|5.0|This album is an absolute metal classic, Metallica in their prime time of songwriting, lyrically and musically. Each song is packed with crashing riffs, mind bending solos, raw singing, and who said you can't hear the bass? Jason Newstead is just extremly tight with james' rhythms, but is still very audible, and he sounds great.  <br />This album contains Metallica's greatest epics, namely \\"...And justice for all\\" and \\"To live is to die\\", though all of the songs here are also very orchestral and thoughtful, and The lyrics throughout are thought provoking and emotional. <br />To me, this album is a landmark and a focal point in the height of emotion and energy that heavy metal music can convey when written and performed with passion, and is really inspirational.
0060931671|5.0|If you've tried to read Pynchon in the past, but never managed to wade through the sheer bulk of his insanity, this might be the book for you.  An excellent introduction to this justly lauded writer, it's not overlong at 160 pages (almost a novella, from Pynchon) and includes a very succinct summing up near the conclusion that safely resolves any doubts about what he's trying to say.  In fact, if this book has a major flaw, it could be that it's insufficiently subtle.  There may be those among Pynchon's admirers who feel that that they're being hit over the head with this book's philosophical issues, and may prefer those books where it isn't laid out quite so neatly for all to see.<br /><br />But many others will find a lot to like in this wildly comic, but deeply pointed novel.  Twenty-eight-year-old Oedipa Maas is appointed executrix of a deceased eccentric entrepreneur's will and suddenly finds herself abandoning her husband to live in a paranoid fantasy-world replete with secret societies, an  underground postal service, and the mysterious organization known as Tristero.  But is her fantasy reality?  Or vice versa?  As always in Pynchon's California, there's no shortage of binge drinking, casual sex, or wild parties, and a good time will be had by all readers who enjoy a good dose of chaos now and then.  The ending will disappoint some, but since there are no easy answers, surely this conclusion makes more sense than any mere pat ending could.

6305428387|5.0|This movie is based on the first Jamaican bobsled team, which competed in the 1988 Olympics.  What I enjoy most about this movie is how the team was initially treated as a joke by fellow Jamaicans and their country, and even each other, but slowly gained the respect of not only their own countrymen, but experienced bobsled teams from other countries.<br /><br />The movie begins when two people who expected to join the Jamaican Olympic team in track and field events lose because a fellow runner fell.  The only other option for Derrice Bannock (Leon, who has appeared in \\"All the Right Moves\\" in 1983, \\"Colors\\" in 1988, and is the innocent man in Madonna's video \\"Like a Prayer,\\" along with numerous other movies) is to form a bobsled team and travel to the winter Olympics.<br /><br />Derrice manages to form a ragtag team consisting of Sanka Coffie (Doug E. Doug), Junior Bevil (Rawle D. Lewis) and Yul Brenner (Malik Yoba).  Derrice also finds disgraced former coach Irving Blitzer (John Candy, in one of his final roles) and convinces him to train the team.<br /><br />The movie then follows the team as they train in Jamaica.  We also watch as family, friends and government officials do everything possible to discourage the team from pursuing their goal.  Even officials with the Olympics do their best to keep the team from entering the Olympics.<br /><br />As the movie progressed there was a point where I actually started to care about the characters, and I wanted the Jamaican team to do well against the established teams.  I supposed that my natural tendency to support underdogs took control here, but I was pleased that the Jamaicans more than competed; they competed and were holding their own.  I will leave it to the viewer to see what happens at the end.<br /><br />While this movie is funny, the humor is obtained with respect toward the characters.  Disney has had its ups and downs in recent years with movie quality, but I would consider this movie one of the ups.  There are a number of stereotypical portrayals, but this is a movie and Disney wanted to be very clear as to who the good guys and the bad guys were.<br /><br />This movie is one that you will want to watch more than once.  While the real Jamaican team that inspired this movie was lost in the humor and the drama created to make the movie entertaining, I believe you will enjoy the humor and the ending where, in traditional Disney style, everything works out in the end.s.

B0009A40ES|5.0|If you own or saw tha original American Psycho, and liked it at all, immediately click Buy. The movie itself is a four star masterpiece, and we get a bevy of special features and an extended cut.<br /><br />Mary Harron directs and co-writes with Guinevere Turner, who writes and appears as Elizabeth in the movie. They adapted the screenplay off of the book by Bret Easton Ellis. They use the backdrop of the Eighties and the Yuppster-wave to create a social satire, surreal black comedy, and suspense horror all rolled into one fantastic movie.<br /><br /> Christian Bale plays Patrick Bateman, a yuppie who has all the right clothes, all the right friends (Bill Sage, Josh Lucas, Justin Theroux), a gorgeus fiancee (Reese Witherspoon as Evelyn), he's cheating on her with her best friend (Sam Mathis as Courtney), and is rising to the height of wallstreet celebrity. There's just one problem.... He has a lust to kill. Everyone.<br />The killer inside is someone he hides behind this mask of success and humanity. But he struggles to even be human. He longs for sex or violence, sometimes both. But when things start to get out of hand, he begins to lose his sanity, blending his perception of the monster within with the reality around him.<br /><br />Christian's performance is amazing, as we find out in the commentary that not only did he have an amazing and rigorous excercise regimen to get an amazing physique, but in some scenes when he is dealing with inspector Kimball (Dafoe) he actually sweats on cue. Anyone who has seen him in Batman Begins, The Machinist, Equilibrium, or Velvet Goldmine will know he is a modern master, always putting himself through intense preparations for his roles. The rest of the actors are great too, with their 80's parody and preppy accents. The only thing I thought needed more screen time was Willem Dafoe. He had plenty of time in the book, and he gets top billing, but he is hardly used in the movie.<br /><br />The movie does a really good job of an ambiguous ending and keeping the line between what Bateman is imagining, and whats actually happening. The scene where he is going on his rampage with the chainsaw, and the one with the gun, are so violent and over the top, that were not even sure why things are happening or if they even are. In the ending, were left with a sense that in a world where everyone strives to be the same, Bateman can't even be recognized as himself, even when he's trying to get caught. A scary and disturbed theme, that applies to more than the fictional world of Psycho, but seems as though it could have been a true story of the 80's and maybe even today.<br /><br />This is the 'uncut killer edition' so we're treated to some great specials features, in fact more (in a sense, more on that in a minute) than I've seen. The other editions had only a short making-of and a interview with Christian Bale. However, this edition gets 2 commentary tracks, Six deleted scenes, 3 making-of featurettes and behind-the-scenes/interviews. Also, and odd addition of an essay written by Holly Willis and read by singer Sarah Elquist.<br /><br />The first commentary features director/co-writer Mary Harron. She talks about the idea behind translating the book to screen, some of the happy accidents during shooting, the actors, etc. It's a good commentary that not only gives you info on the movie, and the controversary surrounding the book and movie. She follows the movie well and doesn't stop more than a couple times. The second track features Guinevere Turner, cowriter. She does not do such a good track speaking about her inspirations and what they changed and took out in reference to the book. But she really just watches the movie, and kinda complains.<br /><br />The 'Postcards from the 80's' featurettes are sort of a making-of crossed with the VH1 formula: A whole lot of critics and producers/crew and random celebrities talking about the three parts of getting the movie made; 'The Book', 'The Deal', 'The Film'.They also go quite in depth in these three bits about the controversy of the book, and later how that affected the movie. Also, there's another called, 'The 80's: Downtown'. It's a look at the nostalgia elements used in the film. Same idea as the others, random people including people involved in the movie.  Lastly, is 'The Violence of Pornography' essay. It looks at it's own social commentary from both sides. Something the films doesn't touch and not a lot of movies who would tell you the critique of it's content.<br /><br />Overall this disc is a great special release, and even if you already own the original, get this one. A great addition to horror fans or yuppie haters collections.e controversy of the book, and later how that affected the movie. Also, there's another called, 'The 80's: Downtown'.

6305718954|4.0|Slash her, choke her, stab her, flog her: she won't die, she's the incredible Frankie Paige!  Despite this, Stigmata may seem on the surface to be a run-of-the-mill horror flick, but nothing could be farther from the truth.<br /><br />Frankie Paige (Patricia Arquette) is a hard-living, hard-partying, wild hairdresser in Philadelphia.  After her globe-trotting, uncaring mother gives her a rosary she got at a small church in Brazil, Frankie begins hallucinating, and becoming injured.  The doctors think these wounds were self-inflicted.<br /><br />Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent by the Vatican to investigate rumors of a woman with stigmata.  Kiernan is an investigator for the Catholic Church, documenting claims of bleeding statues and the like.  But Kiernan is frustrated when he realizes the Cardinal (Jonathan Pryce) only wants to put such rumours to bed, not to truly explore them.<br /><br />Kiernan and Frankie become close, which angers the Cardinal. As she spends more time with Kiernan, her hallucinations turn into full-on possession.  Will Kiernan obey the Church, or defy it for a woman?<br /><br />Stigmata really makes you think.  The end is not at all clear.  It merits much discussion as to was Father Kiernan right in the decision he made?  Who was the entity that possessed Frankie really after?  Was the entity angelic - or demonic?<br /><br />Really a good movie.  Patricia Arquette gives a sincere and feral portrayal of a sinful woman trying to control everything in her, and around her, even when it is killing her.
1401308201|1.0|I am a huge fan of this show as well as of Stephen Schwartz. I bought this book because I wanted the libretto of the musical. Everything I read before I ordered the book stated that it would contain the libretto. It does not. It contains the story to Wicked with large excerpts from the Holzman's book as well as the lyrics, but not the complete dialogue. Large portions of the script are reduced to a short descriptive paragraph. This book is not cheap, but I paid the price because I wanted the complete libretto. I feel like I was mislead.
B00008PW3Q|5.0|Say You Will is an incredible album that took my breath away the first time I heard it.  Loaded with eighteen tracks that get better and better, Say You Will carries you away on enchanting lyrics, vocals, and percussion.  Electronic sounds place this album with one foot squarely in the present, and one foot squarely in the Sixties.<br /><br />Stevie Nicks takes turns singing with Lindsey Buckingham.  The Hippie Witch and Warlock have created a unique, intoxicating brew of music.  The title track is the most accessible to anyone, and is my favorite along with the first song \\"What's The World Coming To?\\"<br /><br />Who says Hippies are dead?  See you at Scarborough Fair.
1577314808|5.0|When any one grab hold of this book in a bookshop, read a little and has the intention to buy or perhaps has bought this book after reading the editoral and customer's reviews, obviously is seeking for answers life has to offer, or has thirst for knowledge about the 'truth', or perhaps at least has the intention to seek spiritual development.  If you are, I think you should read it with an open mind. If you are, you are ones that probably feel that you still have not obtained any answers from your beliefs or religion. Tolle is an enlighten being that is putting his thoughts into words, so that as ajnani (an unenlighten being) can have an insight into his being.  What does it take to understand or gain enlightenment or cosmic consciousness, or the state to be in it? The Buddha gain enlightenment at the moment when he saw the star above while he was under the tree.

B00009V7P8|5.0|Ok, let me catch my breath and tame my enthusiasm, so I can write this review properly.  <br /> <br />I'm still halfway through the listen, but this is something else.  <br /> <br />I too heard Damien Rice first through the soundtrack of the movie \\"Closer\\". \\"the Blower's Daughter\\" was the best song I've heard in a while, and after endless listening to Matt Nathanson I was aching for something new. Not that Nathanson ever gets old, but we all need flavor. <br /> <br />I ran to my boyfriend with extreme superlatives about the song, going on and on. After he listened to the song he replied shortly that he doesn't really understand my reaction, as it is a good song, but not that amazing (I think he was expecting something with more rhythm, according to my excitement). So I explained: <br /> <br />The sensitivity and honesty in that song shine so brightly, it reminds me of Elvis Costello's \\"I want you\\".  the preciseness of the lyrics, how the describe a specific feeling in such clarity is so touching.  <br /> <br />Rice's voice is amazing, and it matches the lyrics perfectly. He doesn't give an over-dramatic tearjerker, he simply mirrors everyday emotions in a sense we haven't looked at before, with beauty; that glowing melancholic beauty.  <br /> <br />I remembered his name from the amazon.com recommendations I've gotten before (btw, amazon recommendations have turned out to be supremely correct), so I ordered both the b-sides and o. I suggest you do the same, if you enjoy Matt Nathanson, John Mayer, Howie Day or their equivalents. He's similar, but not the same - he's fresh.  <br /> <br />Buy and enjoy.
B00005JLPK|5.0|Director Julie Taymor and her subject Frida Kahlo share a flair for color and unflinching surrealism. Taymor both allows Kahlo's work to speak for itself and, at many other points, evokes it in a thorough use of Taymor's owm medium film. Hayek, who I was inclined to dismiss as too pretty for the role, throws herself into the character of this amazing woman artist to an extent that I think even the exacting Ms. Kahlo would have approved. <br /> <br />Frida's paintings take time to grow on some people, but when I saw this movie in the theater, from football jock to computer tech to aspiring artist, all came away feeling as though they had really seen something unique and vibrant. But really, I hate to build it up for you. Better you should see it and experience it for yourself.
0140277447|4.0|I thought this book was absolutely gripping.  Having lived in Poland for several years and visited many of the Holocaust sites, it is easy to forget that this kind of planned, mass extermination has occured many times in history - far past and recent (though I would certainly not conclude the atrocity in Nanjing was even close to that of the Holocaust).  Still, it is hard not to draw parallels and differences between the two. By fate, I now live in China, and have taken an interest in learning more about this forgotten tragedy.<br /><br />The author I thought did a very good job detailing her facts and citing her references, though I need to admit that for the first 1/3 or so of the book I was starting to feel like it was a bit propagandish.  That doubt eventually subsided, and i found the last 1/2 of the book hard to put down.  I often went back to the horrific pictures - staked, beheaded, burned, brutally raped people - very sobering.<br /><br />It is interesting how this massacre has been widely forgotten, and the part of the book that deals with WHY it has been forgotten, is perhaps the most interesting.<br /><br />Still, the one downside of this book - if you compare it to ones like \\"Night\\" (Elie Wiesel), \\"The Pianist\\", etc. - is that the author was NOT a witness to the tragedy.  You cannot blame her for when she was born, but at the same time, I think it is unfortunate that the story is not told by a person who saw the atrocities with her own eyes.<br /><br />I would recommend this book to anyone interested in WWII, wartime aggression, crimes against humanity, or to learn something new that you probably had never heard of before.
0143034901|5.0|The Shadow of the Wind was recommended to me by the same person who suggested that I read The Hours.  I trusted her judgement,  so I purchased the book. I COULD NOT put it down. Reading this book is exercise for the mind.  The characters are intriguing, the vocabulary is challenging, and the story moves quickly. If you enjoy a mystery or a love story with a touch of humor, you will want this book.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I can't write as eloquently as others about this movie, but I will say I thoroughly enjoyed my two hours at the theatre watching it.  I just recently discovered and watched the Firefly series and was thrilled to finally go to this movie.  I do not go  to the movies often, letting them wait to come to DVD, but this one I was determined to see, and would do so again.  I am a bit partial to Captain Mal though (he is a joy to watch), so my review does get biased toward that fact.  Mal does get a bit more serious in this movie, as there isn't quite as much of the lightheartedness that there was in Firefly.  He and Inara can still manage to bicker though, even while under duress.  I loved Star Trek, enjoyed Star Wars, but this series surpasses both of them for me.  And Mal is no Han Solo cliche, pleeease.  The lives of the characters are just so much more realistic, and yes, there is plenty of action to go along with the story.  I wish the best for Joss, he is a creative genius, and I really hope that this isn't the final screen time for the Serenity crew.
0679600701|1.0|\\"race, in his era, was basically the equivalent of a subspecies\\" (to quote \\"Stan\\" quoting Darwin). Is that what you do? Take one sentence from a book and take text out of context? You're right. That's what the rest of the book is for....to surmise for oneself how the word is used throughout the book rather than in a single sentence. And Darwin's book was published at the height of slavery, so you can sugarcoat it however you'd like, but it is what it is: Trash. <br /> <br />As for you equating the \\"Theory of Evolution\\" and the \\"theory\\" of gravity as both being fact yet both being theory, I've got news for you: I don't really need a theory for gravity. At least not on this planet. For instance, if you go take a long walk off of a short pier, I can know that gravity is real. I don't care about drawing up \\"theories\\" about it. Maybe I choose to throw you a life saver. Better yet, perhaps an anchor. That way I can see gravity even more at work, eh? But you DO need to be able to PROVE your theory of evolution. And everyone knows that neither Darwin nor yourself nor anyone else can do it. You like to pretend that macroevolution is obviously true because you have hypothesized it (or theorized). Sorry. That doesn't quite cut it.  <br /> <br />But hey, you might buy into it as much as Hitler did when he had his list of \\"higher and lesser evolved 'races'\\". After all, Hitler loved to read the works of Darwin and Nietzsche. That's your choice also. Fantasyland.
B0007Y08QA|5.0|Christian Bale's performance as Trevor Reznik, a somnambulist with the appearance of a concentration camp refugee, defies criticism and deserves all the acclaim he has received across the world.<br /><br />Trevor Reznik is a character that is reminiscent of the strange characters of great literature, such as Dostoyevsky's Prince Myshkin in the novel, The Idiot, the saintly epileptic, Christ-like figure whose hallucinatory visions haunt the entire novel. Franze Kafka's Gregor Samsa also comes to mind in the novella, Metamorphosis, where he awakes one morning to find that he has transformed into a giant insect. All these characters move in and out of reality, as the line has blurred, existing in a world of sickness and suffering, struggling to attain some kind of insight, as to who they are and what is happening to them.<br /><br />The Machinist unfolds through the eyes of Reznik, a man who hasn't slept in a year, and whose only real friend is a prostitute, (Jennifer Jason Leigh) and as the story propels forward, the nightmare becomes more complicated, much more intense, as we the audience attempt to decipher Reznik's situation: are these hallucinations due to lack of sleep or something more sinister?<br /><br />A new character enters the scene - a dangerous looking man who claims to be working at Reznik's machine shop. The man appears on the shop floor one day and a terrible accident occurs because Reznik is distracted, a co-worker's arm is mutilated and severed in one of the machines. We discover later that this new character doesn't exist, however, Reznik later spots his car, and chases him through the streets of the city. (This scene reminded me of Dostoevsky's novel, The Double) Who is this strange man and why does he seem to know more about Reznik than Reznik himself?<br /><br />This film is a well-constructed psychological thriller, scattering clues throughout, where only at the end, do we discover the cause of Reznik's unique nightmare.<br /><br />One should also mention the soundtrack, an eerie, at times intense piece that underpins the tale, creating the desired, lingering effect. The film's images should remain with you long after its surprise ending.<br /><br />The Machinist would have to be one of the best films produced in 2004./>One should also mention the soundtrack, an eerie, at times intense piece that underpins the tale, creating the desired, lingering effect.

The most recent rock group I latched onto was Counting Crows. I listened to \\"Boulevard of Broken Dreams\\" with my 10-year-old online and we both liked the song. I toyed with buying the CD for quite a while, but (and I hate to admit this!) I didn't do so until after the Grammy Awards. Wow, what an infectious set of tunes. The concept of the CD is interesting and the music is fabulous. I know some \\"true\\" fans think Green Day sold out on this one, but I like it nonetheless--and I'm a music fan who never liked sell outs either! I gave the CD four stars because it hasn't been around long enough (i.e., hasn't stood the test of time) to determine if it will become a classic. However, it certainly has great potential and seems headed in that direction.
0780626966|4.0|Unless you purchased all the nightmare films individually, this box set is definately worth it. Just incase there are still some of you out there who have not seen these movies, I won't spoil the plot(s) for you. The dvd set has clear picture transfer and good sound quality. You get to see each movie in its theatrical widescreen glory. The bonus disc is loaded with good features that any Freddy fan would appreciate. Why don't I give this boxset a fifth star? Well, because I thought that all of the movies were good except for Part 5. Each sequel has received mixed reviews but isn't that usually how it is with B-flicks? In my opinion, each sequel gets more creative as you go along through the series and throughout the sequels you have returning characters. Unlike most B-flicks, the nightmare series got the dvd treatment it deserves. Each disc even has dvd-rom features.

It has a rich musical score, and takes a new totally insane twist on the story, with Dep acting like a psychotic Mr. Rogers, with a touch of Hunter S. Thompson. Speaking of, this movie has inspired a love for raw cacao beans, which you can now even buy here on Amazon.

B0000AUHPK|5.0|I've seen every \\"Heights\\" that has been filmed so far and this one remeins my favorite. I read the book aabout 30 times when I was in college. (I still remember a dorm-mate asking me if I was reading it for a class and exclaiming when I said no, \\"You're reading for FUN?\\") <br />I love most versions I've seen for one reason or another. But the 1939 story was too melodramatic and over acted. (Lightning strikes behind Merle Oberon when she declares \\"I AM Heathcliff!\\"with her eys bugged out.  And they are way too virtuous! These are PASSIONATE people! Passion is not always pretty. <br />Timothy Dalton was great as Heathcliff but his leading lady was homely and the entire story wasn't told.  <br />The most recent Masterpiece Theatre production was good, but the actors were a little long in the tooth to be the Cathy and Heathcliff of my imagination and Nelly was not given the role written for her, in my opinion. <br />The foreign language versions just aren't \\"ENGLISH\\" enough! This is the story of Celts and Angles! <br />Anyhow this is the onw that catches the characters for me! <br />This is the ine that makes me cry and the actors say the lines closest to the way I imagined they shoud be said when I read them during my romantic college days! <br />I love it!

B00005JOI3|5.0|It becomes apparent about ½ way through Marc Forster's (the persuasive \\"Monster's Ball\\" and the boring \\"Finding Neverland\\") \\"Stay\\" that things are not going to make much technical sense and because the beautiful images that he chooses to present are so seductive, I take a deep breath, relax and just let the movie flow over, around and through me.<br />\\"Stay\\" plays with time, perception and the chronology of events that may or may not have occurred. But as opposed to a film like the similarly structured \\"Momento,\\" in which the protagonist is so far removed from ours or anyone's reality, we make a connection, develop a relationship with the trio of Sam (Ewan McGregor), Lila (the impossibly beautiful Naomi Watts) and Henry (the scruffy, pale, skinny Ryan Gosling): a bond based on the empathy and sympathy of Forster's presentation of these characters.<br />Does everything make sense in \\"Stay?\\" No. Do we ultimately care if it makes 100% sense? No, again. \\"Stay\\" is like that beautiful, older, flirty cousin: you admire her, maybe even fall in love with her. You touch her if she let's you... but you can never have a real relationship with her: she is approachable but she can never be yours completely.<br />There are so many films today that never let you close, that keep you at arms length because they are empty, without a beating heart...devoid of any real emotion.<br />\\"Stay\\" grabs and scratches at your heart. It has the guts to be not completely clear about its intentions and its meaning. \\"Stay\\" is like the one night stand that you cannot completely forget...even years later.
B00092ZL80|3.0|back in the day I was a Huge Earth,wind&Fire Fan.the past will always rank real high for me,but it's been hard to see what they have Morphed into. in fact the same can be said about Chicago. because once both acts had David Foster's Smoothed out Synths&Shine added to there work they were never the same acts again.tougher for me with Earth,Wind&Fire because there Band as it was  would wreck a house the Rock&Roll Hall of Fame Performance showcased that.this Version of Earth,Wind&Fire is like a Local Band at my area Holiday Inn that has the songs,etc... down pat,but lacks any real soul&Vibe. seems like they have done the same thing 30 times before in a 31 day month. that is the Problem I have with Modern day live EWF.I ain't even gonna comment on the Studio stuff,because it is Flat&beneath there Legacy. as for chicago:they sound good on the Horns,etc... I would have dug having these two acts together back about 10-15 years ago. there is alot of energy&Talent here,but having followed both Acts it feels like a American Express Performance as to two Acts that are still showcasing themselves at there best. it's pretty Good but a bit too Polished for my tastes.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I watched Kingdom of Heaven last night.  After so many reviews have already been written, I should save my time--having spent too much on this film as it is--but one scene cries out to me for comment.  It is a scene that speaks directly to what I think is the central flaw in the movie.    King Baldwin of Jerusalem is a leper.  Though he is young, the disease has ravaged his body to the extent that he fully swathes himself in fine silks and a silver mask.  Baldwin's humane treatment of the conquered Muslim people of his kingdom, our knowledge of his youth, the beauty of his costumes, the gentle body language of his poses, and the tender voice of actor Edward Norton all combine to make him a wonderfully sympathetic character.    Now to that one scene, which I maintain is symptomatic of the problem which pervades this movie.  As she gazes, in grief, at her brother's dead body-- shrouded, as he was in life--Sibylla reaches down and removes the mask.  Her character will never be the same for me:  she has previously promised her dying brother to remember him as he was as a beautiful boy.  Now she breaks a deathbed vow.  But the worst is to come:  the camera shows us that ghastly face in the coffin.  Now, I am disgusted, not by what I see in the coffin.  I am disgusted with Ridley Scott.  He has just destroyed the one graceful thing in this world of violence he has created.  Don't tell me that this is a philosophical decision:  \\"Scott wants to tell us that all is desolation.\\"  Balderdash!  If any movie ever had a Hollywood ending, this one does.   What Scott wants is to shock.  All in this movie is desolation until it's time to send everybody home with a smile.    Is there a single sword stroke in this movie that does not just draw blood, but arterial blood?  Blood that squirts a foot or two?  I realize that I exaggerate, but not by that much.  The movie begins with a beheading (we're spared this one), progresses to a man (a priest!) being simultaneously run through and burned to death, and culminates with thousands skewered, stoned, hacked, and boiled in oil and tar.  Are these merely realistic battle scenes at the service of historical fiction?  Well, partly.  The brutality may be as believable as any I've seen, though much I've seen (Branaugh's Henry V, for instance) is more artfully done, and thus, more effective; but the fiction is about as \\"historically\\" accurate as Uncle Remus.  That leaves us with Ridley Scott, the auteur of mayhem.  And he was such a fine and imaginative a director in Blade Runner.  I'm no prude when violence is concerned, but if you rip off the mask it had better be to some good purpose.    There's much more, of course.   From the first, when a priest steals a corpse's cross, to the last, when a bishop counsels Balian to convert to Islam and repent later, it isn't simply that the Christian Church is stereotyped as an evil monolith; every official representative of the Church who is characterized at all is evil.  One priest sounds disturbingly like a modern-day terrorist:  \\"To kill an infidel is not to commit murder.    It is the will of God.\\"  This is too familiar a litany to our ears, and too ironic, not to be intentional.  It is as heavy handed, and as ugly, as is the face in the coffin.       I haven't given this movie one star, as some have, since Jeromy Irons and Ghassan Massoud give excellent performances, Orlando Bloom--though miscast in the lead role of Balian--does his best and comes remarkably close to the heroic figure he should be, and the visual spectacle is sometimes enthralling.  When Balian leads his puny few against a Muslim army, the overhead shot makes it appear that the smaller force is being swallowed alive, and that's really all that needs to be said about the affair.  It's a much better piece of filmmaking than what is to follow.      For Balian is spared by the very man whose life he had spared much, much earlier.  You see, he had just survived a colossal shipwreck--the only human being to do so--and had washed up on the shores of Palestine.  He spared this man's life after killing his companion, a renowned fighter, in a sword fight.  (Balian hadn't known how to use a sword that long, himself.  Isn't that special?)  Now, (much, much later, mind you) Balian and the man he spared just happen to meet in the middle of a huge, tumultuous battlefield.  Right.  Not such believable film making.  By the way, at the end, with the army of Jerusalem gone off to its doom, where do Balian's peasant knights get all that armor for his very lackluster speech and the last battle at the gate?      What we need are not more directors who pander to the audience's thirst for blood and explosions.  We have enough of those.   What we need, and need  badly, are more directors who at least aspire to be like Branaugh.  We see the scurrilous murderers sneak behind the English lines in Henry V.  Later, we see the corpses of the slain boys who attend the English camp.  We don't have to witness their massacre; it's much better that we don't.  It occurs behind the mask.  We need more directors who aspire to be like Fred Zinnemann, directors who at least aspire to give us historical dramas like A Man for All Seasons, which ends with the most effective beheading in film history.  We only hear the thwack of the headsman's ax.  Sir Thomas's head falls--behind the mask.
B000B7HZXM|1.0|Rod Stewart ain't much of a Singer anymore&the Crooner thing is a Bad,bad Joke. He wrecks these Classic Songs&none of the Material stands out for me.while the Instrumentation is cool as well as the Arrangements you can't have somebody trying to Croon when the vocals sound very Froggy.
068987474X|4.0|A little repetitive, but entertaining just the same.  The truth hurts, but why settle for a man who's lukewarm on you?  You deserve someone's full attention.  Don't let anyone jerk you around.  That's a good message.   <br /> <br />The only thing that's a problem is that it is one sided as if men do all the choosing.  We can own the fact too that were not that into him and declare that we're not going to settle.
B000B0WODA|5.0|I don't get all this business about the sophomore slump. This album is just as good as, if not better than, the first one. I think it's actually a lot more consistent all the way through. These guys definitely have a talent for hooky songs and fun guitar rock. If you were expecting much more than that, well, I wonder if you really listened to the first album? These guys aren't breaking a lot of new ground but they're very good at what they do, and if you liked the first album, there's no reason I can see for you to be disappointed here.
B00025ETIW|5.0|this cd is my favorite.. they did a wonderful job on this cd. they were awsome in concert as well... i give it 5 stars... im gona name my first girl helena.. from my favorite song on this cd.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have to admit, I was really psyched for Playing The Angel to come out after hearing Precious.  Their leadoff single is a Depeche Mode tour de force, encompassing all of the elements of a great DM single.  And I think that's partly why I initially felt some disappointment listening to the rest of the album.  While overall it's a very worthwhile CD, for the first time I didn't feel it had enough catchy and immediately accesible  songs.   <br /> <br />They've always tried to challenge themselves musically, but the best albums do so while hooking you in with catchy beats and memorable choruses.  It's why Violator (and really for me, all their CDs since Some Great Reward, including Exciter) is held in such esteem.  In Playing the Angel, I didn't consistently feel that way.  I had to sit and chew on the songs for a while before they grew on me.  That's never happened before for me.  <br /> <br />Keep in mind that this is not necessarily a bad thing.  And about 1/2-2/3 the CD is great.  Certainly, any DM album is going to be at least very good - they're too talented not to be.  But I keep comparing Playing The Angel to Exciter.  Contrary to popular opinion, I loved Exciter.  I thought Mark Bell's minimalist style fit the songs well.  And in my humble opinion, most of Exciter's songs are a little better PTA's songs.  Even Precious - I'm probably in the minority who thinks that Dream On is at least just as good, maybe even slightly better.  The second-tier songs of both CDs are about equal quality.   <br /> <br />But mainly the problem is that the worst songs on PTA are nowhere near as good as the worst songs on Exciter - specifically the vocal contributions of Martin.  He's a great songwriter - but his voice is really bad on PTA.  One of his songs is total dreck and he nearly ruins his other song.  I din't feel that way about Comatose or Breathe from Exciter.  I din't feel that way about Counterfeit 2 (another CD panned by most, which I personally think is very good).  But I do feel that way here.  Damaged People alone lowered PTA by 1/2 star. <br /> <br />Here's a rundown of my opinion on the rest of the songs: <br /> <br />A Pain That I'm Used To - 4/5 - a good opener - while the opening high pitched buzz sound still jars me as much as it did on Dead Of Night, I like the effective interplay between quiet verse and catchy chorus.  This one has grown on me from the first time I listened to it. <br /> <br />John The Revelator - 4.5/5 - very catchy, cool song.  Love the \\"Who's That Shouting?\\" call/response in the chorus.  Will make a good second single. <br /> <br />Suffer Well - 5/5 - the pleasant surprise of the CD!  While not as obviously great as Precious, it is sneakily effective - it truly shows Dave's conitnued growth as a songsmith.  This should be the third single - it has potential to do even better than Precious, kind of how on Violator, Enjoy the Silence charted higher than more obviously catchy Personal Jesus <br /> <br />The Sinner In Me - 4/5 - A slow one that has grown on me.  I especially like the guitar interplay at the end of the song. <br /> <br />Precious - 5/5 - the best song on the CD - a great single that harkens you back to the mid 80's style of DM.  The part of the second verse where they sing \\"if God has a Masterplan...\\" ,  with Martin in the background, followed by the chorus, is truly magical stuff. <br /> <br />Macrovision - 3.5/5 - the first one Martin sings.  I kind of like the song, the lyrics are cool, but Martin's voice is horrible and nearly ruins the song. <br /> <br />I Want It All - 4/5 - the 2nd Dave composition - I like it's torchy vibe - another one that's grown on me <br /> <br />Nothing's Impossible - 4/5 - the final Dave composition - another mid-tempo rocker with a sneakily effective chorus with cool keyboard schreeches and blips - would make a decent single <br /> <br />Introspective - 2/5 - an instrumental that is pretty nondescript and does nothing for me. <br /> <br />Damaged People -1/5 - Ugggh! is all I can say - The amazon reviewer is right about the showtuney vibe.  Skip this one every time. <br /> <br />Lilian - 4/5 - a nice bounceback - kind of throwaway, but I likle the beats and it's catchy. <br /> <br />The Darkest Star - 3/5 - the dubby 6-minute closer.  In reality, this one is just OK.  It could've been beter if it were more streamlined.  PTA probably deserved a better ending. <br /> <br />All in all, Playing The Angel starts off well, but trails off at the end.  I call it like it see it - it'll please the die-hards like myself, but it probably won't win too many new fans.  But hey - it's still Depeche Mode and you can never can wrong with that! <br /> <br />
B000001GS3|5.0|This is probably Deutsche Grammophone's greatest release. From a 70's LP, this remastered recording stars Piero Cappucilli and Shirley Verrett as Shakespeare's most wicked couple- Macbeth and Lady Macbeth. At a bargain price, this is a real treasure. It is on the top lists of the greatest opera recordings ever made. Shirley Verrett is still hailed as the ultimate Lady Macbeth. Upon performing the role in La Scala for the first time, she was showered in jewels and carried over the shoulders of ecstatic fans to her limousine. As a bonus, this recording features Placido Domingo in the minor role of Macduff and Nicolai Ghiurov as the ghost of Banquo. Claudio Abbado, an Italian conductor, understands the complexity of the score but does not sacrifice melodic richness and the mix of sprightliness and ominious grandeur found within the score. <br /> <br />Piero and Shirley are on fire as Mr. and Mrs. Macbeth! Their scenes are full of fire and dramatic heft, their voices soar above the orchestra's fortissimi and they each provide a kind of dark, tragic granduer to their roles. Very few singers match their level of expertise. Perhaps only Leonard Warren and Leonie Rysanek in an earlier Metropolitan Opera performance equalled them in success. Cappucilli has a dark, edgy voice and even reminds me of Samuel Ramey, whom to my knowledge has not sung Macbeth but would sound a lot like Cappucilli. Furthermore, Cappucilli died recently and this is a tribute to his great artistry. Miss Verrett is awesome, and her renditions of \\"Vieni T'afretta,\\" \\"La Luce Langue\\" and the Sleeping Walking Scene are among the best, ranking with Maria Callas, Leonie Rysanek, Birgit Nilsson, Elena Soliotis and Carol Vaness. Verrett claims she was initially afraid to get into such a dark frame of mind for the role but her voice is perfectly suited for this character, despite her origins as a mezzo. It is her Lady Macbeth that most people recall with fondness, eventhough Grace Bumbry, too, sang the role inSalzburg early in her career in 1964. However, I favor Verrett's Lady Macbeth over Bumbry's. Without a doubt this is a terrific Macbeth and you won't regret buying it. It is truly the definative version while others pale in comparison.
B0009I7NNA|3.0|I spent a few weeks in California this last summer with a cousin. He's very much into the hardcore screamo scene, and essentially introduced me to the genre, as well as a number of prominent local and nationally known bands. One night we were at a music store browsing when I came across Waking the Fallen. I recognized the artist name, having previously heard them mentioned by a friend of mine back home, so I asked my cousin about them. He told me they were a very popular band, and that the album would certainly be worth buying. I bought the album.  <br /> <br />This was my first introduction to Avenged Sevenfold. Waking the Fallen stunned me, and I quickly purchased Sounding the Seventh Trumpet, which was just as satisfying. Naturally, when I heard their plans to release City of Evil, I didn't hesitate to get my copy.  <br /> <br />To my delight, the first track, Beast and the Harlot, proved to be exactly what I had expected from my previous experiences with the band. The song had a fierce, epic tone, and I immediatley recognized the scripture passage the lyrics had been derived from, and found the song to be a fitting rendition of the fall of Babylon. Burn It Down followed, and I was thrilled. Despite the absence of screaming, the band had managed to preserve its distinctly metalcore sound while obviously progressing both musically and talent-wise. I confess I never made it through Blinded In Chains. My listening session was interrupted, and when I resumed it the song just didn't have the same potent, driving sound I had come to expect. Bat Country, which I had already heard on the radio, struck me as surprisingly \\"glam\\" for the band, which disappointed me. Trashed And Scattered is catchy and a good song musically, but it took me some time to realize it, because I was so dispapointed by the lyrics. They were no where near the bar set by songs on previous albums, like Unholy Confessions and Reminissions. From there City of Evil took a turn for the worse, diving face-first into weak acoustic melodies that didn't even begin to interest me. I bought the album because I wanted the potent, forceful metal sound. I appreciate that the band probably wanted to try a different style for once, but half the album is really just boring. Long songs were an A7X trademark on Waking the Fallen, but here they just refuse to end. Songs like Sidewinder and The Wicked End had great potential, if only they'd picked up after that first minute of acoustics. The only other song on the album I enjoyed after that was Betrayed, which I honestly enjoyed.  <br /> <br />However, the thing that disppointed me most about City of Evil was that outside of Beast and the Harlot, the album completely lacked the eipc, zealous, and decisive tone, both lyrically and musically, that made Sounding the Seventh Trumpet and Waking the Fallen a true pleasure to listen to. Their songs are no longer morbid hymns to retribution and righteousness, and that's really where City of Evil fails as a continuation to Avenged Sevenfold's saga.
B00000DF6O|5.0|I never once thought, when I ordered this, that this might be as good as it is. Who would have thought that a 74 year old man, who has made dozens of records over a period of over 50 years, would put out something as vital and impressive as anything he's ever done. He says in the booklet that he went back to the basics on this album with everything recorded live (no overdubs), in a relaxed atmosphere, and backed by possibly the best band he's ever had. The results are awesome. To top it all off, the recording is top notch; The sound quality matches the performance - Super!
B000A7S4B0|4.0|I thought of the brmc being more of a hard rock group. When I heard they were coming out with a new album, I decided to listen to some of the samples. It completely blew my mind and was so unique. The new sound of brmc is accoustic guitars followed by sassy lyrics and settle percussion in the back. They have completely changed their sound going to a good way and have shown that bands can change their sound in a good way. I recommend this album for people to listen, it's a mix of blues and alternative. It's very original and I hope they continue to produce this style of music
B000BBOUU4|4.0|No matter if you love or loathe chocolate, or admire or despise the 1971 adaptation of `Ronald Dahl's `Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory', starring Gene Wilder, of which Ronald Dahl wrote the screenplay himself - both bars of confectionary should be eaten and savoured upon separately. However there are many edible gratifications to be found in each ambitious undertaking to bring `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' to the screen for everyone to feast their eyes upon without gaining an ounce of weight. All this and more can be found nestled on a slim versatile video disc called DVD for a lifetime of enjoyment.<br /><br />With twelve notable films under his belt according to Empire magazine, the latest being `Corpse Bride', original Black Knight `Batman' director Tim Burton, with eccentric films and hair to match movie producer Brian Grazer's hairdo, failed to get through to the register with his chocolate bar (perhaps due to the long line of people ahead of him desperate to consume the new sensation sweeping the nation), and so has moulded a classic film for his eleventh directorial effort that is perhaps his finest hour yet. For Graeme Base it was, and for talented children's author Ronald Dahl's sixth novel it has proven to be a sweet worth sharing with the world. Thirty four years after the original film, that was vehemently despised by its author comes a wilder, wickeder, brooding interpretation. So expect a distinctly darker block of chocolate now on the market, that, if Ronald Dahl was alive today might delight in the change or cause him to turn is his grave. So versatile is this story it comes in drinkable liquid form being hot chocolate.<br /><br />From early indications when poster work went into production, it was anyone's guess how the finished product would turn out. It's only in the experimental taste-testing, movie preview screenings that we get to indulge in the delectable new creation from renowned chocolate constructer Willy Wonka. There's something under his hat that might warrant some close examination in a padded cell, by a doctor House, with a cane who could meet a man who shares a similar crooked disposition as Peter Laurie's creation.<br /><br />There has been some tinkering done here, with some sections split into bite sized pieces, but with the most memorable scenes intact. However it only enriches the original story, and only encourages more children to turn the pages of the book with appropriately chocolate covered fingers. You'll either find a treasure trove of treats in a colourful landscape that the poster artwork might suggest could be a rainbow after a rainstorm. Be careful though as you consume this for I feel a vomiting sensation will overcome the eater that will leave you feeling sick to your stomach and abandon you as you are burdened with a severe case of indigestion. If this film spoils your appetite like a `Milky Way' promises not to do, you'll be cursing the day you came across this chocolate bar that will forever leave a despicable taste in your mouth for years to come and cause you to spit at like pips in an orange. The pips are coming if you don't think this film has anything to do with oranges but to me it does. You'll implore to anyone who will listen that this chocolate bar doesn't belong to you.<br /><br />Coming from poor yet humble beginnings, we meet Charlie Bucket, (Freddie Highmore) who live with his ailing grandparents, who are in desperate need of an adventure, having been cooped up in a big bed for years on end, and a life-long staple diet of boring old cabbage, that will surely see the grandparents kick the bucket well before Charlie if something isn't done fast. Yet it is a stroke of pure luck and a yearly birthday for Charlie that holds the promise of turning everyone's life around. Peeling back the wrapper of an enticing chocolate bar, hoping for a golden ticket that will secure Charlie's place in a tour of the infamous recluse Willy Wonka's once opulent factory. That was until the factory closed, and one of the afore mentioned grandparents, who used to work diligently for Mr. Wonka, was laid off and replaced by a more efficient, yet impersonal machine.<br /><br />They say time heals all wounds and after years of closure, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) entertains the idea of five lucky children having a tour of his world-renowned factory.<br /><br />It's then we have the distinct pleasure of meeting four other winning children lacking in social graces and delightfully repugnant, Mike Teavee, (Jordon Fry) Veruca Salt, (Julia Winter) Violet Beauregarde, (Annasophia Robb) and Augustus Gloop, (Philip Wiegrat) who fill this film with so much enthusiasm, and an over abundance of self-worth in their daily pursuits, that their luck must surely change before there is time for the children's rotten exploits to decay the smooth flowing mechanics of this film. They would too if it wasn't for Willy Wonka's adept knowledge of his beloved factory to dispose of each contestant in distinctly different, yet ingeniously characteristic methods. A humongous block of chocolate and score fitting to Stanley Kubrick's '2001: A Space Odyssey' is spectacular. The pips I mention before as in the bad children I think of `A Clockwork Orange'. Controversial in its day I can't really comment on it having not seen it, but `Nick Cave and the Bad Seeds' also comes to mind even though there is no music from them. Eminem doesn't get a mention either, Michael Jackson and comparisons about him are a little unfair. He made `History' so he must be doing something worthy enough to record.<br /><br />John August who wrote the script for this and Tim Burton's previous film `Big Fish', does a good job, although I'm more inclined to prefer the `Big Fish' script over `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.<br /><br />When thinking of Ronald Dahl's books `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is indeed memorable. There will never be a movie sequel to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', but there is more great glass elevator in this film. To me, I enjoyed `The Witches' and `Matilda'. Miss Honey in Danny DeVito's film is a honey! I just don't own any of the books or films. I think this will have to change! A movie and book series that comes to mind of a similar dark design are `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'.<br /><br />For me it's all about the adorably deplorable children with kudos to all of them they are all destined to be big stars. For me I liked Veruca Salt who had a blatant disregard for anyone who didn't give her what she wanted, was wonderfully self absorbed in herself and particularly adorable to me. I also wonder if the band of the same name headed by Nina Gordon was an inspiration for them from this book. Violet Beauregard who was a constant gum chewing champion I couldn't help but get attached to. The inclusion of musical numbers is almost nonexistent in Hollywood these days, so to see them in the mix is a welcome addition to Willy Wonka's recipe for success. It would be understandable if people don't lap this movie up in droves. Still if it gets you tongues waging and your mouths chewing on gum, chocolate and the like then it must be doing something right. I loved writing this review and I enjoy the hot chocolate and chocolate bar from Nestle. I'd love to give this film five stars but it just didn't feel exactly right to me so four will have to saffice. This DVD is near perfection just didn't quite do it for me. I can just hear Veruca Salt saying \\"Daddy, I WANT 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' DVD right now!\\" In the end it all comes down to taste and it is indeed an aquired taste at that. Try to restrain yourselves everyone!onka's once opulent factory. That was until the factory closed, and one of the afore mentioned grandparents, who used to work diligently for Mr. Wonka, was laid off and replaced by a more efficient, yet impersonal machine. <br />  <br />They say time heals all wounds and after years of closure, Willy Wonka (Johnny Depp) entertains the idea of five lucky children having a tour of his world-renowned factory.  <br />  <br />It's then we have the distinct pleasure of meeting four other winning children lacking in social graces and delightfully repugnant, Mike Teavee, (Jordon Fry) Veruca Salt, (Julia Winter) Violet Beauregarde, (Annasophia Robb) and Augustus Gloop, (Philip Wiegrat) who fill this film with so much enthusiasm, and an over abundance of self-worth in their daily pursuits, that their luck must surely change before there is time for the children's rotten exploits to decay the smooth flowing mechanics of this film.

He made `History' so he must be doing something worthy enough to record.        <br /> <br />John August who wrote the script for this and Tim Burton's previous film `Big Fish', does a good job, although I'm more inclined to prefer the `Big Fish' script over `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory'.   <br /> <br />When thinking of Ronald Dahl's books `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' is indeed memorable. There will never be amovie sequel to `Charlie and the Chocolate Factory', but there is more great glass elevator in this film. To me, I enjoyed `The Witches' and `Matilda'. Miss Honey in Danny DeVito's film is a honey! I just don't own any of the books or films. I think this will have to change! A movie and book series that comes to mind of a similar dark design are `Lemony Snicket's A Series of Unfortunate Events'.  <br /> <br />For me it's all about the adorably deplorable children with kudos to all of them they are all destined to be big stars. For me I liked Veruca Salt who had a blatant disregard for anyone who didn't give her what she wanted, was wonderfully self absorbed in herself and particularly adorable to me. I also wonder if the band of the same name headed by Nina Gordon was an inspiration for them from this book. Violet Beauregard who was a constant gum chewing champion I couldn't help but get attached to. The inclusion of musical numbers is almost nonexistent in Hollywood these days, so to see them in the mix is a welcome addition to Willy Wonka's recipe for success. It would be understandable if people don't lap this movie up in droves. Still if it gets you tongues waging and your mouths chewing on gum, chocolate and the like then it must be doing something right. I loved writing this review and I enjoy the hot chocolate and chocolate bar from Nestle. I'd love to give this film five stars but it just didn't feel exactly right to me so four will have to saffice. This DVD is near perfection just didn't quite do it for me. I can just hear Veruca Salt saying \\"Daddy, I WANT 'Charlie and the Chocolate Factory' DVD right now!\\" In the end it all comes down to taste and it is indeed an aquired taste at that. Try to restrain yourselves everyone!
B000002L75|5.0|\\"Some great reward\\" es un disco netamente industrial e innovador en el sonido de la banda. Se destacan grandes temas, empezando con los exitos como \\"People are people\\", \\"Blasphemous rumours\\", \\"Master and Servant\\" y \\"Somebody\\", pero hay temas algo menores pero igual muy buenos como \\"Stories of old\\", \\"It doesn't matter\\" y el muy estilo funk \\"Lie to me\\". Aqu viene un tema de Alan Wilder: \\"If you want\\", que a pesar no lleva el nivel letrstico de Martin Gore y que suena a discos anteriores (igual caso con \\"Something to do\\", potente introduccin del disco), musicalmente suena bien. Es uno de los mejores discos de Depeche Mode, siguiendo una parrilla de discos sobresalientes.

B00005BL2A|4.0|Creo que es injusto que crtican a Depeche Mode porque tiene que sonar al ritmo de discos como \\"Music for the masses\\", \\"Black celebration\\" o \\"Violator\\". Pienso que este disco busca innovar un nuevo sonido, a pesar de que echamos de menos a Alan Wilder, pero hay un protagonismo importante en Martin Gore, con la guitarra como protagonista importante. Hay puntos bastante altos como \\"Dream on\\", \\"The dead of night\\", \\"When the body speaks\\" y \\"Freelove\\".

B000ANVQ0K|3.0|Titanic was expected to flop back in 1996, production schedules weren't on track and rumours persisted that the film wouldn't work because of the blend of fact and fiction.  Well, Titanic proved the rumours wrong, and it became a huge success worldwide. <br /> <br />Did I like it?  Not really. At three hours long, I felt it could have been wrapped up more quickly instead of investing so much time into the improbable Winslet/De Caprio romance which clearly would not have happened back in those times.  The scenes which focussed on the sinking and the aftermath helped bring the movie back into credibility.  Many historians agree that the definitive movie of the Titanic belongs to \\"A Night to Remember\\".  I happen to agree, and it is a DVD worthy of your collection.  It will pull at your emotions in a way that JAmes Cameron's Hollywood bluckbuster cannot. <br /> <br />Cameron's epic boasted incredible special effects and is one reason to see the film.  After a disappointing DVD release in 1999, the film will soon be re-released on DVD sporting a new anamorphic print.  Three different versions will be released worldwide beginning in late October.  While not a true fan of this film, I intend to pick up the impressive Australian 4-disc DVD because it will include the acclaimed HBO Titanic Documentary.  The US DVD will unfortunately miss this. <br /> <br />Overall, while James Cameron's film did not entirely satisfy me, it has merits of its own ... but you really cannot go past the better \\"A Night to Remember\\".

B000068FUS|1.0|I brought this on the strengh of the reviews and with a passion for Southern rock, i mean three guitars up front has to be good...unfortunately its not, In fact it is plain awful. A so called homage to Lynyrd Skynrd lyrically this is so embarassing and musically inept. The guitars are distorted to such an extent that you've have difficulty working out what each is playing. This is closer to some of the electric dirges Neil Young has assaulted the unprepared listener with over the years, same tempo, same solo. When you think of the other Southern bands who haven't half the exposure these wannabees have it makes you literally sick. One of the worse things i've heard in years!
B000B9EY2U|5.0|Exciter, the band's previous album, released in 2001, left many DM fans wondering if the band still had it in them to create another \\"exciting\\" album (pun very much intended). Well, Playing the Angel proves fans need not worry - the boys are still on top of their game. They have put together an extremely fun, yet extremely dark and brooding masterpiece that draws from the best elements of past records, while maintaining its own distinctive sound.  <br /> <br />The album begins with the uptempo number, A Pain That I'm Used To. This was one of the three tracks that I allowed myself to listen to before the release date (the entire album leaked beforehand, as is normally the case nowadays). Now, I can't decide whether that was a good choice or not. Hearing that opening note (an alarming and distorted synth) for the first time on release date would have been an interesting (if not heart attack-inducing) experience. Nonetheless, I instantly fell in love with the song's captivating combination of a heavy, yet definitely danceable beat and that infectious gospel-tinged chorus - \\"All this running around, well it's getting me down/Just give me a pain that I'm used to/I don't need to believe all the dreams you conceive/You just need to achieve something that rings true.\\" This is slated to be the second single from this album.  <br /> <br />The industrial pop meets gospel method is perfect on the following track, John the Revelator. From the carousel full of fun sounds to the on-target vocal work, the song is an instant success, and the guys from DM knew it. You can hear a bit of well-deserved pride in lead singer Dave Gahan's voice as he asks, \\"Well who's that shouting?/John the Revelator!/All he ever gives us is pain/Well who's that shouting?/John the Revelator!/He should bow his head in shame.\\" The song is brimming with radio potential and is rumored to be the third single.  <br />Suffer Well is the third track on the album, and the first of three to be written by Gahan (PTAis the first time record featuring songs with lyrics not written by Martin Gore). The song somewhat drops the in-your-face approach of the first two tracks while adding that intoxicating, yet nonintrusive guitar that has been creeping its way into DM's work ever since Violator. Make no mistake though, the track is still heavily electronic based (as is the entire album), and although the title may invoke feelings otherwise, this is one of the lighter songs on the record.  <br /> <br />The beautiful brooding continues with The Sinner In Me. One of the darkest and moodiest tracks succeeds where similar songs on other recent DM albums have failed for many - to maintain interest even when they slow things down a bit. This track with its religious-influenced message and its mid-song distorted guitar breakdown, sounds like something that could have been found on 1993's Songs of Faith and Devotion. Next up is the acclaimed first single from the album, Precious. Many fans are putting this on \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" level greatness. While I do not hold out hope that DM will ever regain that level of popularity (especially in the US), I have to say that they could not have done a better job trying. The track features everything that Depeche Mode does best - danceable synth-meets piano line beats, minimal distorted guitar, and an exceptionally contagious chorus - \\"Things get damaged/Things get broken/I thought we'd manage/But words left unspoken/Left us so brittle/There was so little left to give.\\"  <br /> <br />Macro is the sixth track on the album and the first to feature Martin Gore on lead vocals. This song is the first to really slow the tempo down considerably. While the song is a difficult listen at first (very unlike the first five extremely catchy tracks), to some it will pay off in the end - the gothic minimalist beat combines with Gore's brooding vocals beautifully. Although normally every DM album features a Gore ballad, I think fans will be split on whether or not this track is a success. Continuing with the slower-tempo portion of the album, the second of the Gahan-written songs is track seven, I Want It All. A trip-hop influenced beat (that sounds like it would be right at home on a Massive Attack or Portishead album) backs up Gahan's vocals on this track that could have easily been found on their 1997 album, Ultra. Personally, I think the track is a beautiful success (especially the last two minutes), yet I have the feeling that it could have been condensed to no more than five minutes instead of over six. Some may find this to be a filler or skip-over track. I think that depends on whether you see Ultra as one of your favorite DM albums or consider it to be not-so-memorable.  <br /> <br />Nothing's Impossible picks the pace of the album back up, and is the last of the three Gahan written tracks on the album. This song is one of my favorites as it conjures memories of my favorite DM album, 1986's Black Celebration. To me, this song lyrically resembles a less hopeful \\"But Not Tonight\\" (found on BC). Next up is the inescapable DM instrumental, Introspectre. However well the track does its job of continuing the mood of the album, I agree with others who think the b-side \\"Free\\" (which can be found on the \\"Precious\\" single), or any other b-side for that matter, would have been a more desirable choice here.  <br /> <br />The second of the two songs featuring Martin Gore on lead vocals is track ten, Damaged People. This one is definitely my favorite of the two. The almost creepy music often brings the listener to a point of hope, then wonderfully crushes back down upon us again. Gore's vocal work on the song is perfect (no, not near perfect - just damn perfect) and so fittingly dark that it makes you feel like he was simply aching to sing the words, \\"When you're in my arms/The world makes sense/There is no pretense/And you're crying/When you're by my side/There is no defense/I forget to sense/I'm dying.\\" The next track, Lilian sounds like classic DM and reminds me a lot of what \\"Precious\\" would sound like had it been released on either Music for the Masses or Violator. Lyrically, it encompasses the general mood of the entire album - \\"pain and misery always hit the spot, knowing you can't lose what you haven't got.\\"  <br /> <br />The last track on the album is The Darkest Star. This is the song where the album garnered its name from. This, along with \\"Damaged People\\" are the two most morose tracks on the album. The Darkest Star is a slow, intensely haunting closing track that may unsettle you somewhat, and most likely takes the cake as the darkest on the album - lyrically and musically. Lyrically, it doesn't get much more macabre than this, \\"Oh you sad one/Playing the angel/Isn't so easy where you're from/Oh you wild one/Devil's companion/You won't stay satisfied for long...I don't want you to change anything you do/I don't want you to be someone else for me/Stay as you are the darkest star.\\" And the pounding piano and synth lines back up the somber lyrics and vocal work of Gahan most fittingly.  <br /> <br />4.5 Stars in reality, but 5.0 just because that's not an option!
B00097DX3U|5.0|No filler, all killer!!!  This album is a masterpiece just like there first album.  The opener \\"Your Time Has Come,\\" is a great complete headbanging song, a great awesome way to get there second album going.  The first single, \\"Be Yourself,\\" was an awesome first choice to pick and Tom Morello's guitar skills really shine on this one. Just a great powerful feel good song.   <br /> <br />Other stand out tracks include the title track, \\"Out of Exile,\\" \\"Doesn't Remind Me,\\" and,.. well what the heck, the whole album stands out. <br /> <br />Defintley Recommened! Buy this NOW!!!
B000AU9UYC|5.0|BATMAN BEGINS is a dark, brooding and exceptionally well done entry in the heretofore worn out series.  Christopher Nolan's direction keeps the focus on the dark side of Bruce Wayne's life and he also has as keen eye for visuals and action scenes.  Although the film is necessarily slow in its initial scenes, due to expository reasons, that doesn't keep it from being engrossing and mesmerizing.  Christian Bale who looked so awful in THE MACHINIST is now looking fit and capable in his role as Wayne/Batman.  Bale brings the inner guilt and frustration with the death of his parents, and also his dedication to bringing justice to the ever corruptable Gotham.  Katie Holmes is surprisingly good as Rachel, the dedicated DA assistant also out to bring justice to the corrupt city.  Michael Caine is the perfect Alfred, showing a fatherly side to his butler role; Liam Neeson is sinister in his role as Batman's mentor/nemesis; Gary Oldman does a good job as Commissioner Gordon; Cillian Murphy is effectively evil as the Scarecrow; and Morgan Freeman seems to be having a good time as Batman's munitions expert.  With its intelligent and witty script, and a good lead in Bale, the Batman series seems to be heading in a fresh new direction.

0385486804|5.0|Might do it still.  The urge to walk away from all most of think of as \\"valuable\\" or \\"real\\" or \\"necessary,\\" sometimes overwhelms me.  And the worse it gets \\"in\\" here (Bush, religious terrorists, fundies, Corporate greed, celebrity adoration, reality TV, and on and on), the more powerful the urge.  I would not go where Chris went, too too cold in the winter.  But I can easily see myself walking into a desert, or taking a boat out to sea, and staying there.  So I have no trouble understanding the boy.  Anyone who spends a few hours really looking around at the world ought to be able to understand the boy.  Imagining his last hours as he lay in the shelter of some old bus and died from eating the wrong thing haunts me.  I can easily see that too.  This is not the story of Pi, who drifts across the Atlantic with a Tiger.  This is a real true human story that sticks in the mind and in the gut forever.  Even so, I might still walk away.  But not with Tolstoy.  I'd go with Longfellow's The Secret Magdalene, and if at all possible (considering the weight), with a Seth book or two.
0399237720|5.0|My son is now 4 1/2 and he still loves this book and its resident caterpillar. When he first received the book he read it over and over again until he could recite it by heart and adults were only needed to turn the pages (it is fairly large for a little one to handle solo). He has learned everything from counting and colors to information about caterpillars and butterflies and now it is helping learn word recognition. And don't overlook the simple joy of giving a child a book they adore.
B000056HUA|2.0|All of these tracks are very, very familiar from three decades of airplay and the LP. The net effect of the mix is as if the surviving band mates said, \\"Let's push all Jim's vocals down, and fight over the surround joystick so we each get our share of the channels\\". On most tracks, the band seems curiously crowded in the front, and then suddenly an instrument will blare out the back channels. Jim's voice was mixed low in volume and low in pitch so he is no longer fronting the band, he's singing by himself alone in the center channel. This remix is worse even than the DVD-A of Yes, Close To The Edge, which is an all-time bungle. Ham-handed remixes of well-known material like this are killing DVD-Audio.
B00006RU5B|5.0|This is undoubtebly one of the best rock albums ever.  Just when you thought you heard it all, November 2002 came, and Audioslave came onto the music scene and gave us this masterpiece.  The mixture of Rage Against the Machine and Soundgarden gives us Audioslave, and what do you get, the finest damn rock tunes you will ever hear in your life.   <br /> <br />Every single song on here is awesome and each is perfect.  From the opener \\"Cochise,\\" to the very last song \\"The Last Remaining Light,\\" this cd will make you a true believer of rock music and its power.  No one can top Audioslave.  They are the ultimate rockers.  From Tom Morello's signature famous funky guitar riffs to Chris Cornell's ear catching powerful loud voice, they are truly one of a kind.   <br /> <br />All the songs are awesome and amazing, but the top 5 standout tracks are Cochise, Show Me How To Live, Set It Off, Light My Way, and Iam The Highway.  Every true fan of rock music MUST have this.  If you don't, you have no idea what your missing?? I'll tell you what you're missing.  Your missing one of the best if not the best rock album ever made. Get this now!!  And also get there second cd that came out this pay May, \\"Out of Exile.\\" It also freaking rocks.
0529064847|1.0|The current edition of the NAB has some seious defects.And to <br />me it's not so much in the translation but in the footnotes. <br />This version of the Bible is filled with notes that I would say <br />are downright heretical.The introduction to Acts of the Apostles <br />seems to call into question the historicity of that book. <br /> <br /> <br /> There is a footnote in Matthew where it seems to question the <br />ability of Jesus to predict His Passion. <br /> <br /> There is a footnote in John that categorically states that Jesus <br />didn't speak words that the text has him speaking. <br /> <br /> And of course the Mosaic authorship of the Penteteuch,Apostolic <br />authorship of the New Testament,etc.are thrown right out the <br />window.The one thing this translation does have going for it is <br />that it is very user friendly as far as cross references and <br />chapter headings. <br /> <br />Don't buy this Bible.Get the Douay Rheims,the Revised Standard  <br />Version,or the Jerusalem Bible(but not the NEW Jerusalem Bible). <br /> <br /> The Knox version and the older Confraternity version are also <br />both very good.But i think only the New Testament is in print <br />with these versions.
B000AARKOO|2.0|Nothing.  Everything.  On its' surface, \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" seems like everything desirable in a giant scaled monolith of an epic.  Director Ridley Scott (Gladiator) flexes his visual  muscle, and he shines in overwhemling battle sequences, aided by John Mathiesons' sweeping camerawork and Dody Dorns' forceful editing, both of which are crafted with extraordinary skill.  A picturesque cast attempt illuminate a story about religious conflict that has overt parallels to today.  But \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" commits the cardinal sin of epic moviemaking: it let the story play second chair to its' own visual splendor.  \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is not unsalvagable, but nothing is a better catylist for the audiences' indifference than a two and a half hour epic that is content with a second hand story and a first class look.  It expects the audience to be accepting of shoddy goods delivered in a lovely package.  The trick doesn't work. <br />  <br />\\"Heaven\\" opens in twelfth century France, when a young blacksmith named Balian (Orlando Bloom) takes up his father's (Liam Neeson) challenge to venture to Jerusalem on Crusade, but only after he kills a priest for desecrating his wifes' dead body.  Balian now has two reasons to travel to the Middle East.  Being in a Crusade with absolve him of his sins and that of his wifes,' who committed suicide.  The Crusades themselves are in full, bloody swing, as rival Muslim and Christian armies vie for the Holy Land.  Some are fanatical.  But all fanatics are outdone by the Knights Templar, led by Guy De Lusignan (Marton Csokas) and Reynald (Brendan Gleeson).  The Christian zealots, looking for power and wealth, bide their time as they await the death of the young, leperous but progressive King Baldwin (Edward Norton uncredited), who has fashioned a fragile peace with his contemporary, Saladin (Ghassan Massoud).  The Templars eventually get a golden oppurtunity, potentially spoiled by the presence of Balian, who Baldwin admires and his sister (EvaGreen) takes a liking to. <br />  <br />Even though the film is fatally flawed, that does not mean it still has plenty going for it.  Ridley Scott still stages battle scenes with muscular verve, and the sieging of Jerusalem is spectacular.  He's blessed with a great supporting cast.  Edward Norton and Ghasson Massoud embody understated grace as leaders trying to hold a peace and hold onto the prospect of a better future even as religious wars flare around them.  Liam Neeson once again proves no one is better than him at playing the wise mentor and Jeremy Irons still purrs with his gravelly tenor, giving emotional weight to the kingly advisor Tiberias, a warrior who sees the Crusades clearer then almost anyone around him. <br />  <br />But all of those strengths are peripheral to the main plotline and Bloom.  The films' credibility is stretched too far by debut screenwriter William Monahan, who makes Balians' journey from lowly blacksmith to superknight too abrupt and too easy.  Once he reaches the Holy Land, the new Crusader has the foresight to dig a well on his inherited land (which apparently his father never thought of doing beforehand), hold court with the King and his templar rivals and command armies in battle.  The scenario is too implausible to believe and the film feels distant because of it.  Bloom, to his credit, gives the role everything he's got, trying to register the look and feel of a man caught up in extraordinary circumstances, but he simply does not having the acting chops needed to pull it off.  Director Scott at times seemed to be preoccupied with the crafting of the film, letting Balians' plot arc flounder.  With so much promise in their movie, Scott and Monahan sadly let it slip, and it's a shame.  It could have, and should have been so much more.

0393327655|1.0|The initial review for this book completely overrates it.  The author writes from a condescending, self-centered perspective, casting aspersions left-and-right and jumping to surprising conclusions from flimsy argumentation.  The author's analysis of religious experience is simplistic and his anthropology rife with reductionism.  His description of the Catholic Eucharist is particularly odious, even more so his assertion that it is a bloody ritual connected to genocide.  Toss this ill-conceived clap-trap away and read instead \\"The Fire in the Equations: Science, Religion, and the Search for God,\\" by Kitty Ferguson, a more intelligent, thought-provoking treatment of the subject.
B000A6T1HC|5.0|The period 1703 - 1713, in Rome, was fascinating for the ingenuity of the composers working there.  Staged operas were deemed unacceptable for public viewing by the Pope, so the composers living there turned to oratorio.  The results, as sung by Cecilia Bartoli and played by the Musiciens du Louvre (Marc Minkowski) are endearing, full of invention, creativity, and delight.  They may be new to the ear on first hearing, but a purchaser will want to play them over and over again!

So Rod unless you want to team up with the remaining members of the Faces or Jeff Beck count me out. Beside's all of this the oringinals songs sound better even with poorer recording quality but you have to except that because most of these songs were originally done in the thirties and forties.

0307276902|5.0|Don't let the \\"Oprah's Book Club\\" label fool you---this is an intense read, and not a chick-flick type of book.  There are definitely parts that make you squirm and cringe...some scenes are so vivid, you experience the agony the narrator's describing as if you were the one enduring it.  This book haunts you. <br /> <br />I found the style innovative.  He doesn't use tabs or quotation marks, and he capitalizes random (or perhaps not so random) nouns.  However, his use of run-on sentences is sometimes distracting.  Clever, yes.  But not always helpful. <br /> <br />It's a little tricky keeping track of all the characters he meets while in rehab.  Obviously we only get their first names.  At the end, when we hear what ended up happening to each character, it's difficult to remember who was who.  But the important part is knowing their stories...not necessarily which story belonged to which character. <br /> <br />My only fear is that an addict reading this book might think he/she can adopt James' approach to overcoming addiction, without the use of A.A. or God or anything like that.  His case is extremely, EXTREMELY rare, and readers should understand that.  I mean, after James undergoes his six weeks of rehab, the first place he stops is a bar!  And he orders a drink!  Just to see if he can say no!  I don't recommend that. <br /> <br />Pick up this book if you want an engrossing, engaging read that will both depress you and uplift you.
0894803123|4.0|I can't help but feel good when I pick up this book.  It's exactly what you'd expect in a B&J cookbook.  My favorite part is the ice cream theory chapter.  (It keeps me from adding too much liquor.)  I bought this book for a single recipe -- Cherry Garcia and it was worth it. I have noticed that you don't cook the custards in this book before freezing.  I think this may affect the texture, but I'm not sure.  The cooked custards I make from my Williams Sonoma book are smoother and less icy.<br /><br />Get this book with the Williams-Sonoma Ice Cream book and you'll be set for life.

The music that these groups are putting out in the 2000's all sound the same, but Led Zeppelin has this class about them, you can NEVER get sick of it!!!  This DVD is just amazing.  Picture and sound quality is great.  The solo on \\"Stairway to Heaven\\" was the best rock solo I have ever watched or experienced.  Too bad Led Zeppelin doesn't still tour, or I would go to each and every concert and GET THE LED OUT!!! <br /> <br />ATTENTION ALL YOU LED ZEPPELIN FANS: <br />--THIS IS A MUST HAVE, BUY IT AND ADD IT TO YOUR DVD COLLECTION, THIS WILL BE THE BEST ONE YOU'LL OWN, TRUST ME!!!
0679422714|5.0|Robert Rushad in FrontPageCom. Michiko Kakutani in the 'New York Times' daily edition, and Nicholas Kristoff in 'The New York Times Book Review' all highly praise this book which they claim provides a much deeper understanding of Mao, and the evils he wrought. Kristoff does take exception to the book's wholly negative portrait of Mao's career, and says that by transforming the position of the Chinese woman, and through his program of land- reform  Mao set the stage for the present rise of China economically. He  also questions to some degree the number the authors claim  of seventy - million civilian deaths Mao was responsible for. But he shares with the other two reviewers the belief that this book definitely establishes Mao to be a monstrous mass- murderer, a figure of tremendous indifference to the suffering of his own people. In one passage Kristoff cites Mao thinks aloud about nuclear war destroying hundreds of millions of people and says that while that might have some effect on the Solar System, it would not touch the Universe at all.<br /><br />In the first chapter of the work Chang and Holiday give Mao's family background. He had a loving Buddhist mother and a very hard working peasant father who condemned his son's laziness, and who his son hated. This background could provide the beginning for psychobiographical analysis. But one of the major complaints about the book made by Kakutani and Kristoff is that the book provides the historical record of Mao's action without really probing his character or somehow supplying a real understanding of it.<br /><br />The book debunks the major myths of the Mao legend created by earlier writers about him most notably Edgar Snow.Mao did not heroically lead on foot the long march, but was carried along by others as he read.  It shows that Mao was not the founder of the Chinese Communist Party but an early member.

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Before \\"Takk...\\", I hadn't heard anything about Sigur Rs, but this album surely will keep me on the lookout for more of his work. All lyrics are in Icelandic, which makes understanding the words a little, let me say, difficult. However, the composition of the vast melodies, subtle chords and beats combined with a capturing  voice turns this album into an ethereal journey to a place far away. <br /> <br />I cannot classify or label this style, but it is surely one of the best relaxants out there. But don't confuse this with your standard \\"chill-out\\" or \\"sounds-of-nature\\" CD's; \\"Takk...\\" is amazingly layered and complex: this album grows on you, and this kind of music is after all the best.
1401207138|5.0|I am a foreign amazon.com customer, and after read the 4 reviews of this edition, I felt I had to write one.<br /><br />I bought this OVERSIZED SLIPCASED EDITION along with ABSOLUTE BATMAN:HUSH that hits the store just weeks before this one.<br /><br />I can afirm that this edition of WATCHMEN is one of, even the Best, publication ever released by an Editorial.<br /><br />DC makes this ABSOLUTE EDITIONS like no one else, and brings extra material like a DVD title does.<br /><br />If you want more than just the 12 brilliant episodes, you have sketches, original scripts provided by Alan Moore and all behind the scene stuff.<br /><br />The giant size of this edition could excite anyone, and I must confess that it made a break on me, in the way of see and think things....<br /><br />A REALLY TRUE MUST HAVE for anyone who wants to be delighted.
0684135051|5.0|I had heard of Elizabeth Zimmermann when reading Vogue Magazine but never managed to obtain any of her books until I saw them available on amazon.com as I live in the UK.  I haven't regretted buying this as I have re-read it over and over again and still haven't absorbed everything Mrs Zimmermann covers in the book.<br /><br />It does not teach you the basics of knitting but anyone who can cast on, knit, purl and cast off, and who has knitted a couple of simple items, should profit from reading this volume.  There are plenty of tips and the book teaches you how to make a seamless sweater on circular knitting needles using the yarn of your choice.  This is a major bonus when knitting has become much more international thanks to the Internet, and knitters in different countries cannot always get the yarns for the patterns they have bought nor can they match the tensions in the pattern with a substitute yarn.<br /><br />The book covers several different ways to make socks as well as different techniques for shaping the yoke of sweaters once you have made that first basic sweater with a circular yoke.<br /><br />Elizabeth Zimmermann's writing is extremely witty but at the same time she is so clear in her writing that only a minimum of diagrammatical material is required to show you what she means.  And when diagrams are required they are so clear that you can see at once what she wants you to do.<br /><br />I recommend this to anyone who wants an entertaining knitting book to read (I have been known to sit up late in bed chuckling over this book) and who wants a thorough education on how to do circular knitting.

B0007P3582|1.0|I love hip-hop.  At its best moments, it fills me with joy, inspiration, and positive vibes.  I'm talking about real hip-hop, from the uplifting, uniting roots formed by rappers like Cool Herc and Afrika Bambattaa, to artists as contemporary and varied as The Roots, Haiku D'Etat, Mos Def, Talib Kweli, Outkast, Blackalicious, Pigeon John, The Lifesavas, some Kanye West, etc.  As a 7th grade English teacher, I even use hip-hop that relates to our unit themes or infuses students with creativity and thought-provoking content.<br /><br />And aside from these hip-hop favorites, I even get the itch for edgier rap in the form of Nas, vintage Wu-Tang, Ice Cube,Babbletron, some Def Jux artists, etc.<br /><br />What 50 Cent brings to the table, though, is completely devoid of any talent or worthwhile content.  Immediately what strikes me most is the complete subjegation of women.  What disturbs me most as a teacher is the 12 year old girls at my school who sing the lyrics which so ruthlessly portray them as nothing more than dime a dozen rag dolls.  I mean please, listen to \\"Just a Lil Bit\\", \\"Disco Inferno\\", \\"Candy Shop\\", or \\"Get in My Car\\" (which features such classy and imaginative lines as \\"If Your B+*^h wanna roll, I'ma let her get in\\").  Not only does 50 bring no originality or ability to the table, but he single-handedly catapults society back into the ages when men owned women, and sold and had sex with them as they pleased.<br /><br />This is the message which is being distributed through all networks and avenues of the media (as one other reviewer so correctly cited) so this is not just a reflection on 50, it is a reflection on what is accepted, and indeed, glorified in our society.  At the very least, it is something that people tolerate, which is as serious and real as any other racial, religious, or gender issues.<br /><br />And still, aside from this, 50 can't even offer any talent to mediate the content.  Artists like Louis Logic, Eminem, Immortal Technique, and Paris all spit obscene and offensive lyrics.  The difference is, the either have something to say, or they have undeniable skill.<br /><br />How does rhyming the tag \\"Just a lille bit\\" 15 times in a row indicate the skill 50 boasts about so often, most despicably on the track \\"This is 50\\"?<br /><br />Sadly, this album placed 50 on the zenith of pop music stardom, and it seems as if even Eminem is just an afterthought now, and though I'm not big Em. fan, his skills are mindblowing, and 50 doesn't deserve to stand on the same planet as him.<br /><br />Hip-hop started as a tool to inspire and unite a people struggling to deal with the still inequitable odds that had been stacked against them.  And even when this message, at times, became darker with acts like N.W.A, Wu-Tang, Mobb Deep, etc., there was still, at the least, a New Jack City or Menace II Society-like purpose, and the talent and skill that justified the bravado.<br /><br />I challenge anyone who reads this review and is looking to give it a No vote, to find me a line on this album which represents creativity or something that would place 50 in the leagues of those we consider quality emcees.  If you can, I'll buy the album and send it to you, because that would be like finding a needle in a haystack with no needle in it.<br /><br />And for those of you tempted to come at me with, \\"Man, check out the numbers!\\" consider your limited knowledge about the business of contemporary music.  First, album sales are no longer based on the numbers actually purchased from stores, total albums sold numbers are now based on the units shipped to stores and distributors around the country.  That means you only need to ship 10 million copies of The Massacre to be recognized as having sold that many.  And how many copies are still sitting on the shelves at Amazon or your local Best Buy?  Finally, Britney Spears and NSYNC have sold more albums than 50, so by your logic, they are even more talented than 50.  True?  Well, yes actually, but this point also makes evident the fact that artists selling countless millions are doing so because of image, marketing, and manufactured hype.  Why do you think Em doesn't have his own shoes?  Because he's not willing to sell himself out that far, and 50 is a money whore, he'll do absolutely anything, because it's not his talent he's bringing to the table anyways.  It's his shot up, former crack dealing, gun obsessed (I lost track at 78 when I was trying to count the references to guns on the album) image.  If it's image your looking for, buy this album.  If it's music, look elsewhere.  Even Get Rich or Die Trying would be a better bet for your money.50.  True?

B000002KLP|5.0|With his first two albums, Prince had yet to develop into a serious or lucrative artist.  That all changed when he released his third album, 1980's Dirty Mind.  The production was a landmark in new-wave pop, R&B, and urban funk.  It also broke new ground in its explicit sexual and personal content.  Nobody before the album's release has bared so much.  Nearly every aspect of sexuality is discussed here: Homosexuality, excessive libido,  threesomes, oral sex, incest, sexual freedom: everything Prince could think of.  The album was recorded at his home studio with Prince playing nearly every instrument, with the exception of Dr Fink playing synthesizers on some of the tracks and Lisa Coleman doing some of the backup vocals.  The album opens with the title track, a four minute robotic funk jam that sums up the whole album.  When you here lyrics about laying down a woman in your daddy's car you know your entering some interesting subjects and lyrical themes.  The most notorious subjects are explained in tracks six and seven.  Track six titled,\\"Head\\", is the most explicit number about oral sex ever written.  \\"Sister,\\" is one and a half minutes of incest, lost of virginity, oral sex, nudity, and graphic language.  Threesomes are discussed in track two and four while homosexuality and sexual freedom are discussed in tracks three and five.  The closing track titled,\\"Partyup\\", is a relentless dance jam about dancing and partying as opossed to fighting in a war.  To sum it up, 1999 and Purple Rain might not have come around if this album wasn't made.  At only a half-hour long this album makes for a nice, short easy listen.  Get this album and see what most pop and hip-hop has been built upon

B0002V7ODI|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />Based on the works of Mike Mignola, \\"Hellboy,\\" written and directed by Guillermo Del Toro, is a better-than-average comic book adaptation that boasts a refreshing sense of humor amid all the customary action sequences and first-rate special effects. The story begins in 1944, near the end of World War II, with the Nazis attempting to open a portal between earth and a hell-like dimension where seven evil deities have been lying in wait for just such an opportunity to come in and take over the world.  One creature from the other side makes it through before the Nazis` scheme is thwarted, a young \\"boy\\" who is adopted by an American expert in the paranormal and groomed to become a superhero who can do battle with all the supernatural creatures who apparently exist in an abundance undreamed of by the vast majority of the human race.<br /><br />The makers of the film have wisely chosen to keep Hellboy life-sized and believable in both his physical and psychological dimensions.  Despite his red skin, stone right hand and ability to leap from rooftop to rooftop with gravity-defying ease, Hellboy is really just an Average Joe-type, with a bit of an ego, a sardonic sense of humor, a strong sense of loyalty, and a really good heart.  Heck, he even has problems in the romance department not much different from what all the rest of us go through at one time or another in our lives.<br /><br />The movie is overlong and the screenplay probably includes one or two monsters more than it needs to in order to get the job done, but Ron Perlman, even under all the heavy makeup, makes Hellboy a three-dimensional, sympathetic character, while John Hurt brings warmth and authority to the role of Professor Bruttenholm, the \\"father figure\\" who raises him.
B00005JNEI|5.0|Okay, I'm a huge Mac Catz fan and when I heard all 1 season(s) of the show (plus three unaired episodes along with the extended pilot) were hitting DVD on the Farenheit 9/11 collection I was stunned! They were hitting the shelves so I was hitting the couch to watch it. And my wife nagged so I hit her too. But not really, I only thought I did, but only 'cuz I was watching Mac Catzzz! Unfortunately, this is the English version and only features commentaries by the English voice-over actors and not the original Japanese voice actors who made the show such a hit in China. But this isn't the Cosby Show you're used to. Oh no! They even added Morgan Spurlock to the mix to jazz things up a bit as he is fly with the ladies. Another downside to the DVDs is the fact that Morgan Freeman is no longer the narrator of the beloved show, but all of his dialogue has been rerecorded by Jeff Foxworthy so they had to change the name of the show from \\"Good Times\\" to \\"You Might Be a Redneck if and Goodtimesv.\\" Yes, \\"Good Times\\" is now spelled \\"Goodtimesv\\" and I don't know why. I think it might be a typing error as this DVD package was clearly rushed to the shelves and doesn't even feature any special features or audio commentaries. And why does it start showing that Coca-Cola documentary commercial whenever I hit \\"menu\\" and it won't let me skip it? I even talked to my doctor about it because he minored in health occupations but majored in \\"graphix,\\" you know, like on tricked-out rides (and he designed the DVD menu) and he can't even explain it. But in exchange he even tricked out my ride so me, my wife, and my catzz can hit the town in style. Dinner's on me tonight Mr. Paskerly! (That is my cat'z name.)<br /><br />Pete G. Williams lives in Michigan with his wife Marissa and forty-some-odd cats.
B000B2YQX4|1.0|This album is their worse yet.  I love DM and really think that they are trying too hard to reinvent themselves and their music and are going the wrong route.  Let's face it, an old 80's band like DM is a love it or hate it band and will NOT attract new fans.  All they can do is maintain the loyal ones like myself.  I thought Exciter wasn't all that great, but it was ok..if..you are a loyal fan.  But this new album is simply boring and awful with the exception of 2-3 songs.  Still I bought it and am going to their concert as a true fan.   I think that this maybe their very last DM album.  Atleast if they make a new album, make it like the old electronic DM classics we all know and love.
B000002H33|5.0|The world had just barely accepted Metallica's first two albums, the revolutionary debut,\\"Kill'em All\\", and their second masterpiece,\\"Ride The Lighting\\", when their third album,\\"Master Of Puppets\\", came out in 1986.  This is where Metallica truly found their well-known and trademark sound.  Opening with the thrash anthem,\\"Battery\\", you are immediately plundged into the hectic and forceful environment of heavy metal and speed metal. As each song progresses, you treated to lyrical themes that extend well beyond the usual love, sex, and romance which dominates rock and R&B.  The title track for example is a metaphor for the controlling force of drug addiction.  \\"Welcome Home (Sanitarium)\\", is not just about a nuthouse but anybody who secludes themselves from the outside world.  \\"Leper Messiah\\", is a down right controversial stab at the incorrect use of religious faith.  Don't be fooled by the haunting acoustic guitar riff that opens the album because it soon explodes into complete mayhem. Some of Kirk Hammett's best guitar playing is featured on this album,(check out the solos on tracks two and seven).  Lars Urich's lightning fast drums can be experienced on the title track and,\\"Disposable Heroes\\".  James Hetfield's powerful and furious vocals dominate the entire album.  The album owes its thunderous sound to the late Cliff Burton.  His bass playing on this album adds structure and texture to the record.  Sadly, shortly after this album was completed, he died in a tour bus crash is Sweden.  This album will always be remembered as his finest moment.   <br />     Amazedly this album recieved no play on MTV and little play on the radio.  Regardless this was one of the first heavy metal albums to be hailed as a masterpiece by both metal enthusiasts and mainstream critics and record buyers alike.  Seldom has a record broken some much new ground and broken so many barriers.  An absolutely incredible album that is a must have for anybody who enjoys hard rock and heavy metal
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I never saw this series when it aired, and I wish I had.  I saw the movie, Serenity, and I absolutely loved it.  The characters were intelligent and all had foibles and weaknesses.  The plot was straight-forward, but with enough twists and turns to keep your mind focused.  The storytelling, however was outstanding. It was effective and purposeful, without a wasted scene.  In other words, the story felt real.  So, the day after seeing the movie, I bought the Firefly collection.  The show is even better than the movie.  Some may find the western/cowboy slang ridiculous or may feel the fusion of western/scifi to be silly.  For me, I get what Joss Wheldon was trying to say.  The future won't be nice and rosy ala Star Trek.  It could be grim and hard for many people and a return to previous ways of existence - the gun in this case (and the sword in even earlier times), may prove necessary.  Once the luxury of civilization is stripped from settlers on a very rough frontier, previous means of survival and living can take over.  So, cowboy justice; not trusting strangers; slavery; indentured labor-all of these may be seen.  But despite these hurdles, the characters in Firefly are a family.  They bond only with one another and strangers don't automatically earn their charity.  They are often cruel with one another as only family can be.  They are uncaring of others' misery and engage in willful blindness to some of the damage that their actions bring upon others.  Despite these flaws, they still do the best they can for themselves and when forced to confront the evil all around them, they rise to the challenge and offer up all that they have.  Their stories are set in an epic setting -  a space operatic milieu - but their actions are highly personal, discrete, and limited.  They aren't out to save the universe; just one another.  Their stories are believable and true because we can all envision ourselves in the crew's place and acting similarly.  This is so refreshing afterthe 3 deadly dull Star Wars movies and the impotent, utopian, flailing of Star Trek.  I am passionate about this show, and I would love to see sequels to the movie, or even better, direct-to-DVD episodes.
0525948023|5.0|OK, I am not a 'professional' reviewer.  As a matter of fact I have never reviewed a book in my life, although I have read many.  However, I have been deeply moved enough to enter this review.  I just wanted to let anyone who's interested know that after studying Eckhart Tolle's books, videos, and CDs, this new book 'says it all' for me.  I believe it takes the message to many more people who perhaps couldn't 'read between the lines' as well as we would have liked to in The Power of Now.  I have purchased two more copies for my daughters and intend to buy several more for friends.  I am grateful to Eckhart Tolle for all the spiritual guidance he has provided me and I invite you to read this book as a gift to yourself and the world.

It's nice you get a remastered 5.1 DD audio experience, but visually this concert is incredible and needs to be accomodated in finer picture quality. You can forget about an High-Definition version of this concert coming out anytime soon, because it isn't. Now I really don't care. What a joke!
B00004XQJX|4.0|Diabelli was a minor composer and music publisher.  He had a brilliant idea for promoting himself and his publishing company by recruiting fifty of the most illustrious composers of the Austrian Empire to supply a single variation on a waltz he had written.  Everyone who was anyone in the music world responded.  The work was published in 1824 as the\\"Vaterl&auml;ndische K&uuml;nstlerverein\\" and included composers such as Liszt, Czerny, Schubert, Hummel, Kalkbrenner, and Mozart's son, Wolfgang.<br /><br />Beethoven, one of the supreme masters of the variation form, began working on some ideas for this \\"cobbler's patch\\" of a waltz, as he called it.  He soon had several good ideas and continued developing these into one of the major works of his late period and one of the great examples of the variation form of all time.  A pianist as important as Alfred Brendel has referred to \\"The Diabelli Variations' as the greatest of all piano works.  The collected set of variations were published in 1824.  Beethoven's set was also published in that year, but as a separate volume.  Its importance was immediately recognized and maintained its stature ever since, no matter the musical fashions.<br /><br />Muarizio Pollini has long been heralded for his technical wizardry and he has many fans who also love his approach to the music he plays.  Others find that they feel held at a distance and that his playing lacks the warmth and friendliness of other great artists.  No matter which side you fall on, you can find this recording brilliant and insightful.  This is widely acclaimed recording and it deserves the praise it gets.<br /><br />While I do believe that it is wrong to criticize an author for not writing the book you want or the artist for not taking your preferred approach to the music, I do have one quibble with Pollini's interpretation.  One of the very important aspects of this work is its humor.  This is a masterwork with very serious musical aspects as analysts have been pointing out since its publication, but they also note that it is funny.  No, Beethoven is not a cheap joke maker, but the work does have some laugh out loud moments.<br /><br />One of the things a pianist needs to pull this work off, is the ability to tell a joke and Pollini may lack that ability.  The pianist must not only be able to smile, but have be able to communicate a knowing wink with his listeners.  I shouldn't fault him for that, and I really don't, because he brings so much great work to this recording.  But I have never felt the humor in this recording.  Plenty of transcendence, but not a single nudge to the ribs.  Nor have I read anything about this recording commenting on its humor, or heard anyone tell me they laughed at this or that variation.  For me, the dizzying aspects of the work begin from the waltz itself.  Every variation has such wide contrast, or such witty parody, or anything else Beethoven spins off that it is hard not to think of this work as a huge mystical scherzo.<br /><br />Still, if you love this work, this is a recording you should hear and enjoy.  However, I will keep looking for a pianist who \\"gets it\\"., but they also note that it is funny.  No, Beethoven is not a cheap joke maker, but the work does have some laugh out loud moments.

B00000GAIW|5.0|There are plenty of reviews of this wonderful 1971 album on amazon and all over the internet.  If you want a detailed breakdown of just how good it is, go find one and read it.  Suffice to say, 'Aqualung' (along with their next studio release from 1972, 'Thick as a Brick') were Tull's high water marks.  Oh, sure, 1978's 'Songs from the Wood' came close and is probably their third best studio recording, but it's this one that took the band from being considered really good to being considered rock legends.<br /><br />Having said that, shame on Chrysalis/EMI for ruining the sound on this fantastic album by trying to \\"improve\\" the sound digitally.  I mean, it sounds AWFUL.  They have used computer based noise reduction software and taken away the \\"breath of life\\" that any good analog recording should possess.  Try and find a used DCC version of this somewhere else...you'll pay through the nose for one, but it sounds like it should.  Avoid this version of the CD at all costs!

B000AARKOO|5.0|I am a history teacher and though I was aware historians were crying foul of the inaccuracies (and I noticed a good amount in the film) but despite these, I was very pleased with it.  I have to say that I tremendously admire Ridley Scott and the cast for making this film in these turbulent times.  His point was to show (primarily the Western world) a little piece about the clashes between Islam and Christianity.  And, be warned, this could cause tremendous animosity on all 3 sides: Christianity, Judaism, and Islam.  Muslims could lament about the loss of Jerusalem more so as could Christians.  Jews could view it as an attack on Israel's power there.   However, to the educated viewer, it does the exact opposite: It inspires.  It shows the tremendous chivalry that existed between good men and shows you how the extremists ruined a lot and brought more death to innocents.   <br /> <br />Though it is true that most Crusaders were extremists and I doubt that there would have been so many rational ones (as the movie depicts; it is definitely \\"updated\\" for the 21st century).  Scott shows you the parallels between a crazy Guy de Lusignan to a bin Laden or even a neo-con.  He portrays the de Lusignan as idiotic.  He also tries to show you how blindly mad many of the Christian Crusaders were.  He does this by having a man quote at the beginning (something along the lines of) \\"It is not a sin to kill an infidel.\\"  The viewer should make the bin Laden/ terrorist connection very early on. <br /> <br />The film's climatic scene (SPOILER alert) where Balian (Bloom) and Saladin meet to discuss terms of surrender, Saladin promises that no one will be hurt and that they will all be allowed safe passage out of Jerusalem.  Balian replies that when Christian crusaders took Jerusalem that they killed Muslims (and Jews) in great numbers, so how can I trust you?  And at a point where I got goose bumps he replied (Something like) \\"I am not them, I am Saladin Saladin.\\"  Yes my friends for that moment CHIVALRY was ALIVE!  Saladin let most of the city's inhabitants go unharmed and did not take revenge on the Christians (though admittedly he did sell some survivors into slavery and did poison the wells including razing the land to prevent Richard the Lionheart from advancing.)  Nonetheless, the moment of chivalry at the end cemented my positive review of the film; it brought everything together nicely and I would have considered it a travesty had Scott left it out.  Scott is trying very hard to show that we can co-exist in this world.  And because I am such an extreme moderate and as a teacher, one who emphasizes coexistence, the historical inaccuracies were fine for me to deal with.  If you know the history and watch this film, it truly has the chance to inspire us all.   <br /> <br />Although I would have especially liked to see Scott present more of the languages difficulties here (all English, very little Arabic . . there would have been more complexities between communication between the Crusaders, etc) I am sure he did this to appeal to mass audiences and ease their understanding of it all.   <br /> <br />I applaud Ridley Scott (again) for being bold and trying to show us all that religious and ideological extremism (in all cultures) must be eliminated and goodwill and chivalry (though conflicts will persist) must be absolute. <br />
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Ok, I was a fan when the show first came out, and at the time, I thought I was the only one. Now, years later, the BDM has appeared. I was so excited, but no one else was, so I bought this DVD set for many of my clueless friends, and together we almost single-handedly filled our small theatre. I was so proud.  <br />This show has everything! Action, humor, action, humor, and of course, tads of melo-drama. It's perfect, and I think it's a welcome addition to any DVD collection, or sci-fi collection. It's also a whole lot better than many people realize. Two of my friends(who now love the show) both said they never realized the show was good because it was cancelled so quickly they thought it was pretty bad. How wrong they were! The show just never had time to latch on to many people who just never had time to sit down and watch it!  <br />I'm proud to say I was a fan from the beginning, and that I have created at least 8 other fans, and the word is spreading from them to their friends. Just give the show a chance, you never know. You may be a Browncoat underneath and never had a chance to figure it out.
B000AQBA1W|2.0|First I must say that I am a huge Corrs fan. I have loved all of their music and videos and unlike a lot of other people think that Borrowed Heaven was a masterpiece.  <br />I have been excited to hear this since I first caught wind of this project.  I waited for it to come out in the US but finally bought a import of it as it does not seem like it will come out in the US. <br />Well I think that you should be warned that this does not sound like a Corrs album but rather a Andrea solo album with Jim playing piano and a few guest appearances by the other women.  <br />The things I love about the Corrs are gone.  Their are almost no vocal harmonies to talk of with most of the songs just Andrea alone.  One of the best parts of the Corrs has been Sharons counter melodies which their is not one anywhere on the album.  And besides the two instrumentals and a couple of small pieces Sharon's violin, clearly the main sound I have thought of as the Corrs is not there.  Maybe she is part of the overblown orchestra but I doubt it.   <br />And Caroline is not playing any drums (besides the guest appearance or two on the Bodhran.  In fact in the one picture Caroline is in the back and her face is completly blurred.  Is this telling us something? <br />Andrea sounds just fine and I like it as mellow background music. But there is nothing gripping like \\"Everybody Hurts\\". <br />I understand it is supposed to be traditional songs, but does that mean that they couldn't have put some of the trademark Corrs sound on it? <br />The version of Old Town is nowhere as good as the one on Unplugged and The Live in London video so why? (and everyone keeps referring to it as a Thin Lizzy song.  It is not a Thin Lizzy song but from a very bad Phil Lynott solo album.  It is a great song, but not a Lizzy song) <br />I have had the CD for less than 4 days, listened to it about 5 times and alas, am about to stick it in the CD rack where it probably will stay.  Unlike the other Corrs albums that neverleft my current play pile for months if not years. <br />I can only hope that this is not the Corrs swansong.  I guess as  <br />a Andrea solo album it is okay, and if I look at it like that maybe I will like it better.
B000002MUN|4.0|Tom Petty really used this album as a comeback album and was well received, as it should have been.  Filled with classic Petty tracks, this album delievers with every song.  Released near Petty's Greatest Hits CD, this was part of a streak in which Petty found great success in the mid-90s with these two albums and the \\"She's The One\\" Soundtrack.  An excellent CD and must own for any fan of great rock music.
B00005ATQ9|3.0|I have to give credit to Stanley Kubrick for being the only director to never make the same film twice.  If one were to watch all of his movies, one would never know they were made by the same man.  This is incredibly hard to do and very few filmmakers have undertaken that risk.  Even fewer filmmakers have undertaken that risk and were successful at it.  Kubrick was both and that might be one reason why he is loved by so many film lovers all over the world.  Although I can give him credit for that, I also feel his films are deeply flawed and some are quite boring.<br /><br />'Barry Lyndon' is a lot like many other Kubrick films.  It is directed in stunning fashion, with several brilliant sequences throughout.  It is beautiful to look at and the costumes great.  At the same time, the film fails in creating a character the audience can like watching for over three hours.  I doubt many film lovers can possibly like the main character of this film.  He is a user and an opportunist; he has almost no sympathy for the people he has hurt and used throughout his lifetime.  Something bad happens to him at the end of this story.  Although it is bad, I felt that he deserved much worse than what he got.  He hurt and abandoned too many people in his life to receive something that was the equivalent of a slap on the wrist.
B000002UAR|5.0|Overshadowed by the massive adulation afforded to \\"Sgt. Pepper\\" - which for at least two decades after was considered the Beatles, and even rock music's finest hour - time has shown \\"Revolver\\" not only to be a better but much more pivotal work. <br /> <br />Why? Well caught, in early 1966, between a global audience who simply wanted more of their peerlessly tuneful \\"pop\\" songs, and a musical mind-set that was a million miles away from where they'd been only a year or so before, the Beatles pulled off the extraordinary feat of pushing rock music's boundaries out to the edge while showing that musical innovation could still be integrated into a satisfying melodic framework. The result? Well at its most extreme \\"Revolver\\" has \\"Tomorrow Never Knows\\" & \\"Love to You\\" (two of the mid-60's best avant-garde tracks) colliding head-on with \\"Here There and Everywhere\\" \\"Eleanor Rigby\\" & \\"For No One\\" (three of the most beautiful MOR ballads ever made) with each sitting, quite comfortably, within what has to be the broadest musical canvas ever committed to disc. <br /> <br />But it's what goes on between these extremes that makes \\"Revolver\\" such a brilliant album. In \\"Taxman\\", \\"I'm Only Sleeping\\", \\"She Said She Said\\", \\"And Your Bird Can Sing\\", \\"Doctor Robert\\" & \\"I Want to Tell You\\" the Beatles took the explorations that others (most notably the Yardbirds and the Byrds) had started and then applied their outstanding song-writing skills to them to show just how good this new music could be. And, because it was so good, they catapulted it straight into \\"the mainstream\\", laying down a reference point which others were bound to follow. What happened over the following year of huge musical change, culminating in \\"Sgt. Pepper's\\" anthemic but far less challenging celebration of it, owed a huge debt to \\"Revolver\\" - not only the Beatles best album but the catalyst for a scale shift in rock music. <br /> <br />If you haven't done so recently, play it and be amazed... and if you still don't own it, get it straight away.    <br />
B000000OUE|4.0|On \\"Astro Creep 2000,\\" the follow up to White Zombie's breakthrough album (1992's \\"La Sexorcisto\\") the group doesn't stray to far from the formula of their previous albums. In fact many of the elements (i.e. tongue-in-cheek thrash on top of industrial metal with growly vocals, ominous horror movie samples, and overtones/themes which are cartoonish yet equally dark) just seem resurrected. Nonetheless, this is probably WZ's best effort. With a \\"beefed up\\" sound (which comes as a result of an \\"everything but the kitchen sink\\" production job), you'll probably not even notice that the musicianship is good, but not top notch (and it can even be a bit simplistic at times).<br /><br />Even still, there is plenty to like on \\"Astro Creep 2000.\\" \\"Super-Charger Heaven\\" is probably the catchiest and most well known song on here, but the sexy, R-rated \\"More Human Than Human\\" is a close contender. And \\"Electric Head, Pt. 1\\" (which has bobbing riffs) and \\"Pt. 2\\" are very catchy, as well. Also, \\"Creature Of The Wheel\\" and \\"I, Zombie\\" have strong, churning riffs, track nine has more powerful, driving guitar work, and \\"Blur The Technicolor\\" has catchy, chug and churn riffs, and the album ends with a pounding rhythm and eerily calm vocals.<br /><br />The bottom line is this album sounds great, and is mighty catchy! I don't recommend it to fans of Nine Inch Nails-esque industrial metal, but definitely check it out if trashy/raunchy, riff heavy, tongue-in-cheek industrial metal is your cup of tea. And, like all of Rob or White Zombie's releases, try not to think too hard on it.
B000002BFZ|4.0|Pearl Jam is still at the top of their game, though maybe not quite at their peak.  \\"No Code\\" is another solid album from one of the greatest Rock bands of all time.  A must for any Pearl Jam fan or fan or 90s rock.
0812416910|5.0|This is the only book that I have read more than once.  I will be reading it again.  Great.
0743454537|5.0|This is an extremely realistic book and that is coming from someone who has gone through the loss of a child and the trematic experiences prior to that.  I don't know how Jodie Picoult got things so right, but she touched ever nerve in my soul.  I cried throughout the book but it was a true catharsis.
B000001C6M|5.0|As of 1983 (when this album came out) Slayer were still an underground band, and their type of music was still relatively unheard of. Only Metallica and (Slayer's influences) Venom and Motorhead dared to venture into music this speedy. But since this disc was released, an almost countless number of imitators have cropped up.<br /><br />Every basic ingredient is here for a classic album: evil lyrics, insane guitar work (including blindingly fast riffs, great leads and scorching solos), pounding drums, high pitched vocals, and even an occasionally audible bass guitar! In fact, virtually the whole album flies by like a black tornado. Track one, \\"Evil Has No Boundaries,\\" begins the album with a bang, and shoots out of the gate with a blistering main riff and a skin crawling shriek from (vocalist) Tom (Araya). \\"The Antichrist\\" is the first of three classic songs on here (alongside \\"Die By The Sword\\" and \\"Black Magic\\"). \\"The Antichrist\\" has a couple guitar solos and the aforementioned audible, beeping bass line! Next, \\"Die By The Sword\\" has fast, churning riffs, and a nice, extended solo, \\"Black Magic\\" has more blindingly fast riffs, \\"Tormentor\\" has probably the best solo on the album, and I enjoy how \\"Crionics\\" builds and gains density (with the help of a few guitar solos). Finally, the title track has great, catchy drumming, as well as even more riffs which shoot by like white noise.<br /><br />So, \\"Show No Mercy,\\" Slayer's debut, is as brutal as it is relentless and merciless. It isn't a classic like, say, \\"Reign In Blood,\\" but it's still a good album and it foreshadowed the greatness to come from future Slayer releases. Thus, this is a great history lesson for those who are new to thrash or interested in its beginnings, and it is essential listening for diehards of this genre and this band.
B000001DTM|5.0|Not only the best U2 album,  but i consider this to be the greatest album I've ever heard, period. <br />The only album that ive heard that comes  close to this masterpiece is U2's  OTHER masterpiece , \\"The Joshua tree\\". <br /> <br />1-The album starts off with  \\"Zoostation\\",  which is ironically  one of my least favorite songs on the entire album..  Still , its a good song, and a great song to kick off  what was their first  1990's album.      Overall i give this song  7.5 out of 10 <br /> <br /> <br />2- The 2nd song on the album is \\"Even better than the real thing\\", a song that along with \\"Mysterious ways\\" would really define the sound of U2 for this period of time... A high-energy song that will make you stop paying attention to everything else you're doing.... make sure you're not doing anything important while listening to  this album , cuz it gets better... way better.       8.5  out of  10 <br /> <br />3- The third song  is \\"one\\"... if you are familiar with U2 at all, then im sure you've heard this song at some point.... personally, this is one of my favorite songs .. nothing else out there sounds like it.. the beautiful melody, touching lyrics... simply amazing....     10 out of  10 <br /> <br />4- \\"Until the end of the world\\" is the 4th song on this album.. The edge is the star of this song.. He is not flashy or anyting, but his guitar sounds just perfect.. Bono's lyrics are awsome, and clever... Took me a while to figure out what he was talking about, but once i did, i was amazed at how well written it is...    10 out of 10. <br /> <br />5- \\"Whos gonna ride your wild horses\\"   is a simply beautiful song, one of U2's best overall.  Again , amazing lyrics, beautiful music,   the producer of this album  is a genius. <br />  10 out of   10 <br /> <br />6-\\"So cruel\\" is a song that starts with simple drums, but then turns into a song with one of the best production ive ever HEARD in my entire life.. everybody is a star here,  Bono,  the producer, adam clayton... it just rules.       10 out of 10 <br /> <br />7- \\"The fly\\" is a song that shares the style of \\"Until the end of the world\\"...  The edge's solo at the middle song is awsome... again, the edge is not the fastest guitarist in the world, but his touch is amazing..     9 out of  10 <br /> <br />8- \\"Mysterious ways\\"... a catchy song with a great beat...  \\"great beat\\" is not something many people expect to hear when talking about a U2 album, but this song rules. <br />     9 out of 10 <br /> <br />9- \\"Trying to throw your amrs around the world\\".. THis is my other least favorite song on the album... its not bad, its quite good, but cant measure up with the other masterpieces on this album...     7 out of  10 <br /> <br />10- \\"Ulta violet (light my way)\\"...  this song has one of the most beautiful beginnings to a song ive ever heard, but the rest of the song doesnt quite live up to the start.. still, good stuff..    8 out of 10 <br /> <br />11- \\"Acrobat\\" ... we're back to perfection.. this song has it all... awsome drums, guitar, vocals, lyrcs...  one of my favorite lines on the entire album can be found here...  <br />\\"And I'd join the movement  if there was one i could believe in... Yeah, I'd break bread and wine  if there was a church i could recieve in... cause i need it now.\\" <br />10 out of 10 <br /> <br />12-The album ends with \\"Love is blindness\\", a beatiful  slow song to end this master piece with... more great lyrics, \\"Love is blindness, i dont wanna see.. wont you wrap the night around me? oh my love, love is blindness\\" <br /> and again, the production here is top notch... <br />9 out of 10 <br /> <br /> <br /> <br />OVERALL : 10 out of  10  get this album  or you would be missing out <br />
B0007GAERG|5.0|Well, I'm sure you all know the story since the album was released in April, but the product is certainly worth all of the hype.  On April 12, Mariah released her most vocally impressive and musically balanced record in years.  On Emancipation, she proves that her voice, while not at its technical best, is still a force to be reckoned with.  She belts with a new power and rawness behind it  now, and its maturity adds an emotional element that was not present before. <br /> <br />But beyond the voice, what carries this record is the music.  With an artist like Mariah, the quality of song can at times be overlooked because her vocal is so important, but here the songs are what keep you wanting more.  The uptempo tracks \\"It's Like That\\", \\"Say Somethin'\\", \\"Get Your Number\\", \\"Your Girl\\", and \\"To The Floor\\" all have a more convincing R&B/Hip-Hop punch than on her previous CDs.  She draws inspiration from the golden age of Motown R&B on some tracks and the sparse, 2005 hip-hop on others, and they all work.  This is the first Mariah Carey album where the uptempo tracks might outshine the ballads. <br /> <br />The exception to this rule is clearly the summer chart-topper \\"We Belong Together\\".  You've probably heard this song about a million and one times at this point, but I can think of no song as worthy of all the attention.  The emotion behind her mid-range belt compliments the mid-tempo ballad's theme perfectly and the climax is breath-taking.  \\"Stay The Night\\", \\"Circles\\", and \\"Fly Like A Bird\\", although having a much more classic R&B style than \\"Together\\", use her maturing voice to produce similarly impressive results. <br /> <br />My only issue with the ballads is that the melodies, aside from \\"We Belong Together\\" and \\"Joy Ride\\", never seem to measure up to the likes of \\"Lead The Way\\" and \\"All I've Ever Wanted\\".  I guess no album is truly perfect---but this one is pretty darn close. <br /> <br />Buy The Emancipation of Mimi if you're a fan of Mariah or R&B in general.You won't be disappointed. <br /> <br />P.S.-For all the people out there stressing over Mariah Carey's Emancipation Re-release, don't worry.  The album will be on iTunes as well, and if u don't want to shell out $15 dollars for the whole CD, just download the new songs (like the future #1 \\"Don't Forget About Us\\") for $1 a pop.  Problem solved.
B00003CXAE|5.0|by Shaniqua Wright. <br /> <br />The best part of Grease is the romance part. The reason it's the best part is because every time Danny and Sandy break up with each other they either sing or cry back to each other. To me it's a sad part. When Danny tried to kiss Sandy in the drive-in <br />movie, Sandy got out of the car and ran off. Danny ran after her but he couldn't find her. So he started singing a song called \\"Sandy\\", singing that he was lonely. <br /> <br />Another interesting part in Grease is the prom night. On the prom night Danny and Sandy were dance partners. When Sonny and Rita came to the prom. Sonny grabbed Sandy when she was dancing with Danny. Danny kept dancing and went to grab Sandy. Rita grabbed Danny and started dancing with him. Sandy left the party. Danny and Rita won the trophy, but Danny was hurt because after they won the trophy, they had to slow dance together. Danny wanted to win with Sandy. <br /> <br />The last part of Grease I'm going to tell you about is when the teenagers went out on their dates. Danny and Sandy were dating while Kenichie and Betty were on their date. While Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Doody, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty were dancing, Danny and Sandy had snuck in. They sat at a table and put the menus up so no one would come over. The waitress came over to take their order. Danny ordered a bunch of food. Sandy ordered the same. Danny asked her if she was going to eat all of that. Doody came over there, then Betty, Frenchy, Kenichie, Sonny, Putzie, and Marty came and crowded Danny and Sandy. Danny was disappointed because he wanted to be alone on their date. Kenichie and Betty got into an argument with Kenichie because he put his arm around Frenchy. Betty got mad and threw strawberry milkshake in Kenickie's face. <br /> <br />To find out more about the movie, rent it or buy it.

B0007Y08IS|5.0|by Nick Daniel.    Team America World Police begins in Paris where they teach the terrorists a lesson and kill all of them. The movie is filled with non-stop action and a plot that has many twist and turns. It will determine the victors of the never-ending battle between the  terrorists and Team America. There is also a relationship between Gary and Lisa that must stay afloat through all of the carnage,  and will be challenged by every plot twist.    All in all Team America World Police is a great action/comedy with award winning music by Trey Parker that will keep you on the edge of your seat.

B00005JNJV|5.0|People who have seen the previous Batman movies and still have the gumption to say they don't like this one apparently have a fetish for anatomically-correct Batsuits, gaudy Mardi-Gras Batmobiles, and villains so excruciatingly over-the-top and utterly fixated on 'Peabody & Sherman'-caliber puns that they make Cesar Romero look like a Nobel Prize winner for painting over his mustache to play the Joker back in 1966.  And if this be the case, then they're completely missing the point of what Batman is all about, what director Christopher Nolan and screenwriter David Goyer accomplish with \\"Batman Begins\\".  By keeping their source material close to heart, they give us Batman in his very best, most functional form: the Dark Knight, relentless, obsessed, unstoppable in a one-man WAR on crime where the stakes are as high as they can get.  It's what Bill Finger and Bob Kane first envisioned back in 1939 (ask any comic-book/Batman diehard what it means to 'raise the Finger' and you'll get a tale in itself).  It's what made Frank Miller's \\"The Dark Knight Returns\\" the end-all-be-all of Batman stories and comicdom's first true epic.  It's what sent moviegoers lining entire city blocks on June 23, 1989.  It's what won Paul Dini, Bruce Timm and their WB Animation team an Emmy here and there for their version of Batman.  And it's what makes \\"Batman Begins\\" the best Batman movie ever and one of the best superhero movies ever.  Sealing the deal is what is arguably the best cast of any Batman movie, starting with its star.  Christian Bale more than earns his wings as both Batman and Bruce Wayne, portraying the latter with appropriate ebullience and charisma, and the former with resplendent darkness and pure fright.  Only Michael Keaton came as close, but he, of course, was lacking in the physical requirements of the role, hence the rubber outfit; Val Kilmer, by contrast, LOOKED great in both parts, but his brooding Batman left Bruce Wayne a little stiff; and then, George Clooney essentially played George Clooney playing Bruce Wayne as well as George Clooney playing Bruce Wayne while wearing a Batman costume.  Bale stands head and shoulders above all of them: in one scene, his Bruce Wayne responds to a 'crisis' in a hotel restaurant with hilarious results; his Batman, however, has no compunctions against putting a corrupt cop through an horrific mid-air interrogation, dangling precariously several stories over the street below.  And - perhaps most importantly - unlike the previous Batman films, not once is that which is Batman lost in the character of Bruce Wayne; Nolan and Goyer have finally tapped the fact that unlike so many other superheroes whose true deep-down personas are really seen in their normal guises, Batman is the man beneath the mask, and Bruce Wayne is the disguise; Spider-Man may take down the bad guy, but at the end of the day he's still Peter Parker.  Bale's portrayal of the character as scripted by Nolan and Goyer gives Batman new psychological depth which few writers have been able to get away with in a film genre like this, where every other character spends half the movie in a tight form-fitting bodysuit.  That Bale carries the first hour of the film with nary a cape or cowl in sight fits into a dramatic tradition in the best of superhero films, embodied by Jeff East (dubbed by Christopher Reeve) as young Clark Kent in \\"Superman\\" and Tobey Maguire as a pining Peter Parker in \\"Spider-Man\\".  In his crusade to spare Gotham the hallucinogenic ravages of crazed Arkham Asylum director Jonathan Crane AKA the Scarecrow - played with sufficient chills by Cillian Murphy in the first genuinely creepy Batvillain role since \\"Batman Returns\\" - and the enigmatic ninja warlord Ra's Al Ghul - a cool-as-ice Ken Watanabe, abetted in the film's compelling first hour by Liam Neeson as the equally-mysterious Henri Ducard - the Dark Knight is aided, as always, by faithful Wayne family butler Alfred Pennyworth (Michael Caine, brilliant as ever),who dutifully aids his charge in combatting the corrupt influences in Gotham City but bears increasing concerns for the welfare of both Bruce and the people he's fighting for.  His relationship with Bruce forms much of the emotional bedrock of the film.  Also assisting our hero is ousted Wayne Foundation board member Lucius Fox (Morgan Freeman turning in a typically excellent performance), head of the Applied Sciences department that's been long forgotten by CEO William Earle (Rutger Hauer, acting with such oily benevolence you can practically see the dollar signs dancing in his head), thus making it the perfect place from which Bruce can appropriate his needed 'toys'; as well as not-yet-Commissioner Jim Gordon (Gary Oldman in a surprisingly likeable performance), one of the last remaining good cops in Gotham who shares Batman's discontent with a broken 'system', thus cultivating the roots of an unlikely but strong partnership; and, lastly, Katie Holmes as Bruce's childhood friend Rachel Dawes, now a persistent assistant DA whose quest for the truth about Crane's experiments predictably makes her a target for the mad doctor.  Holmes's character represents the one readily-apparent weakness in the film that has been suffered by every other Batmovie except \\"Batman Returns\\": a female lead who doesn't make any really significant contributions to the plot or development of the other characters.  Still, Holmes turns in a sufficient performance given what's required of the role, so I'm willing to let that slide.  That's not to say that the film doesn't have any other weaknesses.  Murphy is a much scarier presence without his Scarecrow mask than with it, there's a repetition of remarks and criticisms that are spat back and forth between rival characters as moments of conflict progress from the first hour to the climax, and the \\"surprise\\" reveal that kicks said climax into motion can be seen coming by anyone with half a brain in their head.  But fortunately none of that detracts enough from the overall story to have any significant or lasting impact by the time the end credits roll.  And then there's \\"The Tumbler\\".  Easily the most controversial element of the film, much was made prior to the film's release of what is surely the most unconventional version of the Batmobile ever designed (yes, even more so than those neon hippy-wagons in Joel Schumacher's Batwrecks).  The cool military functionality of its design and its impressive speed and maneuverability might have been greatly diminished had this Batmovie been filmed primarily on soundstages like those before it.  But that is where the beauty of the film's cinematography pays off in the second hour: the location shoots in Chicago afford us the opportunity to not only see the most wicked Batmobile chase sequence ever, but to see it at work in parking ranges, on freeways, and, yes, even on top of buildings.  Indeed, the decision to shoot live-action plates rather than build Gotham from the keel up in a movie studio may be one of the single greatest artistic decisions in the franchise's history; it's definitely something new to see.  And nothing we've seen so far beats seeing a \\"big black tank\\" barreling down a REAL interstate at 125 miles an hour with two dozen squad cars in hot pursuit.  Granted, this car will undoubtedly evolve over the course of the inevitable sequels into the Batmobile we all know and love, but it's fun to watch this \\"embryonic\\" Batmobile going through its initial paces (yes, even during the cheesier moments when Gordon is forced to take the controls).  \\"Batman Begins\\" represents what happens when a capable cast and crew commits themselves to making a believable work of entertainment while staying as true as possible to a rather fantastic source.  It tells you something when some of the best comic-book movies ever made - from \\"Superman\\" to \\"Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles\\", from \\"The Rocketeer\\" to \\"Spider-Man\\" - are the ones that don't stray too far from the originalstories.  Maybe Hollywood should be paying more notice to that.  And if you want proof, then \\"Batman Begins\\" is as good a place as any for you to sit down for two hours and see the evidence for yourself.
0780622553|5.0|Dark City is a wholly unique world with its own visual eccentricities, emotional archetypes, and a twisted set of repressive rules.   <br /> <br />This movie is true science fiction in that it posits a technology and attempts to explain how humans would react to that technology and the totalitarian world created by the effects of its use.  And does it much better than Lang's Metropolis, by the way. <br /> <br />Yes, the movie is visually dark, complex and disturbing.  The plot is also dark, complex and disturbing.  Yet, to me, the revelation of what is actually happening to the characters is what sets it apart. <br /> <br />Some people complain about the relatively flat affect of the actors.  I believe the director strove for this.  Imagine how people would react in a world that physically changed overnight.  Imagine how your emotions would be torn apart if you lost your parents one day and your wife the next and your memories of both have been erased from your conscious mind while parts floated around in your subconscious.  With no emotional anchors, people either get manic, psychotic or depressive.  Most of the characters in this film are depressive.  And the main character is both depressive and psychotic.  Don't expect normal emotions in a decidedly abnormal world.  Ul;timately, it is very difficult to be a full human being when you are really just a rat in a cage. <br /> <br />Keifer Sutherland is brilliant as the twitchy doctor who helps perpetrate the mining of human minds for the \\"Strangers\\", but who, ultimately proves all too human.  His fervent idiosyncracies contrast greatly with the other humans wandering around lost in a constricted, confusing prison of a world.       <br /> <br />The final shot of that world makes clear what the movie is all about. If you don't like this movie, you just don't like science fiction. <br /> <br />It kills me how so much \\"sci fi\\" is popular for the very reasons some don't like Dark City.  When Empire Strikes Back is the most well-crafted film of the Star Wars series, yet has the lowest box office, you will understand that many people do not want to contemplate how technology and creatures without emotion might affect their world. <br /> <br />
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This movie isn't as good as some past mind @%*% movies, but it definately is worth a look at.  <br />The ending is twisted. <br />I understand that Saw 2 is coming out.
0714834491|5.0|As an artist and designer I found this to be a most wonderful book. The title is very appropriate. The layout, text and pictures really challenge conventional thinking. The book is huge and not really meant to be read in one sitting so don't try. I just keep mine of the coffee table and pick it up opening it to a random page everytime. I always put it away with a new sense of vision and delight. Highly recommended for everyone. EXCELLENT!
B000002ITW|5.0|CSN&Y fans will love this double cd!  The first cd is easy-listening, kindof acoustic, then it gets nice and heavy (\\"electric music\\" as they say at the end of track 10, disc 1).   <br /> <br />I agree with the one reviewer who was upset at the measly 33 seconds of Suite: Judy Blue Eyes.  And how in the world can you make Cowgirl In The Sand be less than 4 minutes long?  That's like being served a club sandwich that has nothing but the bread.  Wassup with all that?  However, fear not!  You get plenty of great stuff. <br /> <br />Neil Young's 9:41 minute blend of \\"The Loner\\" \\"Cinnamon Girl\\" and \\"Down By The River\\" is one you'll listen to over and over again.  Yes, each one could be 9 minutes long live, but it is hauntingly smooth and like no other version. <br /> <br />In 1966, Stephen Stills wrote \\"For What It's Worth\\" with Buffalo Springfield, and he works it into disc 1 track 10.... \\"stop, children, what's that sound?  Everybody look what's goin' down...\\"  cool!  and a valid message to any generation. <br /> <br />\\"Long Time Gone\\" is great.  But \\"Southern Man\\" clocking in at 13:45 minutes, is fabulous!  There's your whole commute to work!  Crank it!  Then Ohio gets cut short, to under four minutes, but it is well done.  (The Isley Brothers did a rocking 12+ minute version shortly after, in 1971, blended with JH's Machinegun.)   <br /> <br />As for the early '70s banter between (and in some) songs, we might all be surprised to hear that these supposedly anti-establishment guys actually told their audiences that America is great!  Listen to the improvised lyrics on track 10, disc 1.  (And if you're game, check out Steppenwolf Live, also from the early '70s.  They did the same pro-American words, though they wanted things cleaned up.  Awesome music there too!)  <br /> <br />This version of \\"Carry On\\" takes the show!  Clocking in at almost 15 minutes, it will get you home from work, unbothered by traffic!  Go for it!
B000B2YQX4|3.0|I am sorry to disappoint any of you. I have been a huge Depeche Mode fan for about twenty years. The last album that gave me the 'Mode' shot I became addicted to was Sofad. Ultra was OK and some of its songs at least sounded more or less like Depeche Mode. Exciter and Playing the Angel do not sound 'Depeche Mode' at all and did not give me the 'Mode' shot. <br />After Alan's departure DM sounds like the producer who produces their albums makes them sound.  <br />I really miss the Depeche Mode sound that Alan created and re-invented every album: a complex, rythmic, layered and most of all very unique wall of sound that supported Martin's excellent song writer capabilities. <br />Playing the angel is not bad, but it leaves me untouched.
B000AM6OQ2|5.0|After a watch of the film with whatever cover colour you want, this is a great piece of work. <br />The end product delivers the goods in so many different ways. <br />Whilst it is most definitely a thriller, it is a thriller on a par with none, and most importantly, it is based on a real historical event, but motivated by a trip to Stone Henge. <br />The Documentary features reveal much about the two stage  process that was used in production. The commentary covers as much as any film fan could hope to want in this DVD. The Features deliver interviews done at the time of the original release, and Three very good  reasons to see the film are Adrienne Barbeau ( the actual Lead in the Script), The ever loveable Jamie Lee, and her superbly Gorgous Mom... oh, and a great and spooky film story that is ramped up by Rob Bottins great FX, Hal Holbrooks superb Performance, and some very good second unit work, to supplement the mood created by the main production work. <br />ENJOY
0786915749|5.0|Dragons of Autumn Twilight is the first of a series of books that introduces you to the world of Krynn and different creatures, such as trolls, dwarves, kenders, ogres, gnomes, and elves.<br /><br />  In the beginning, the main characters are Tanis, Raistlin, Caramon, Sturm, Flint, and Tas. Tanis is a half-elven, Raistlin is a human mage, Caramon is Raistlin's brother and a skilled warrior. Sturm is a noble warrior who dreams of becoming a Knight of Solamnia. Flint is an old dwarf who is skilled at crafts and fighting.<br /><br />  Tas is a kender, and kenders mean trouble. Things just \\"happen\\" to \\"fall\\" into their pouches. Later in the story, they meet up with Goldmoon and Riverwind, two plainsmen who are the last survivors of their people. They also bring Tika along after she follows them into a dangerous area. She is the bartender of an inn where they were supposed to meet. They also \\"recruited\\" a few more people for their quest to stop the dragonarmies, the army of the enemy. When I say recruited, I mean people join them against their will.<br /><br />  This book has an exciting plot, and also has a lot of action and humor. It also tells what each person is thinking so that you learn all about the way they act and who they are.<br /><br />  When I first started reading this book, I thought it was really boring and confusing. But then, after a few minutes of reading, I immediately understood what was going on and it was suddenly interesting. I would recommend this to anyone 6th grade and older, because it is harder for younger people to understand what is happening in the beginning.
B000002UVX|5.0|When I was probably 12 years old, my dad bought this CD for me. He loved to listen to it, and told me about Jimi's influence in the late sixties. Well 7 years later and I am still marvelling at the incredible talents of Jimi Hendrix. If I could have been at one concert ever, there is absolutely no question it would have to be this one. I can't imagine what a treat it would be to have seen this performance LIVE! Anyways, although it was my first experience with Jimi's music, I probably wouldnt recommend it to others who are just first experiencing him. Definetly pick up Axis:Bold As Love if it's your first CD. And if you are a Jimi Hendrix fanatic, definetly check this CD out. Also, check out the four disc set of previously unreleased tracks.
B00005JO0J|4.0|Serenity is what going to the movies, in the classic sense, is all about. It's a popcorn flick with brains and you can't ask for much more than that. Don't let anybody fool you into thinking that the new Star Wars movies are better and this is a rip off of that series. Star Wars is itself based on archetypes that have been played out over and over again in stories for centuries. The classic and strong storytelling elements devolved into an empty shell of its former self.<br /><br />On a much lower budget, this little movie has all of the meat and potatoes of a good space opera... adventure, humor, tragedy, heroics, and conflict. Serenity does not compromise its ensemble cast by dulling all of the rough edges. They're all cast-offs running from the long arm of the law (the Alliance), barely scraping by, and wearing their shortcomings on their sleeves. Translation: Interesting characters who drag you, the viewer, through a lot of great stuff with some shocking surprises.<br /><br />Give this movie a chance, pay to see it, and tell your friends. Enough business might bring it back from TV purgatory, which would definitely be a good thing.
B00005ASIL|3.0|all of jt's \\"greatest\\" hits on cd have not been complete. EVERY single time, they have left some songs out. I know just about everyone else posting ratings says this too, but i'll say it again...<br />  -\\"teacher\\" = missing<br />  -\\"cross-eyed mary\\" = missing<br />these songs are, in my opinion (apparently not ian anderson's/record company's) their 3rd and 5th best songs respectively. I don't know if they freaked out over having too many songs from \\"aqualung\\" on the CD, but they definitely made a big mistake that disappointed many jt fans.<br />this leads me to my next point, just buy the album \\"aqualung\\" if you like some jethro tull stuff... although the thick as a brick album is one of a kind and very enjoyable<br /><br />1. aqualung  2. locomotive breath 3. bungle in the jungle  4. teacher 5. cross-eyed mary  6. thick as a brick<br /><br />or just download their best songs --^<br /><br />peace out
B00005JOI3|3.0|This was a complicated movie to make; when you're dealing with depressed people, the other actors talk in a depressed manner also, which is disconcerting.  Nothing upbeat about this film -- reminded me of 'The Hours' and the way a depressed person has the most trouble getting through all of the hours of a day.  In this convoluted story, it was hard somtimes to tell when the world was an illusion (the dream sequences) or if it was actually taking place at all.    I fell in love with Dr. Sam Foster; I have never noticed before that Ewan McGregor has Bill Ross' mouth.  I have not had the opportunity to see Bill in at least 25 years, but when I saw his mouth, it brought back his 'Indian heritage' good looks and the way he smiled.  Henry, the troubled artist, looked like a grown-up Eric.  I thought all along that he was real, not a ghost, but he acted just like Zach did after Charlotte's betrayal and he attended Belmont College as an introspective loner.  Ryan Gosling was or could be Zach's double.  He was delightful in his inferiority complex and anguish of losing out on life.  He proposed to a waitress and then to the nurse at the scene of the accident.  It hurts to be so alone.    Bob Hoskins was good as Leon, blind and not blind.  At first, I thought he was Ed Asner.  \\"Sometimes we don't want to remember what the truth is.\\"  But, in this weaving in and out of dreams and ghosts still 'stay'ing around for Henry's benefit, it was sometimes impossible to know what the truth from fantasy. Was Lila one of Dr. Foster's patients or a nurse?  Her fortune cookie said: 'trouble will cease and fortune will smile upon you.'  A few years back, I had one which said: 'your talent will be recognized and suitably rewarded.'    Since the centenniel of the Brooklyn Bridge, I've always wanted to see it close up.  Now, while viewing this intrigue underneath the bridge, my wish has been fulfilled.  Dr. Foster rode the subway to the Brooklyn Bridge to save Henry.  But suicide brought on byguilt (your tire blew out) is a big problem, and he was too late.  \\"I was wrong.  Look around you.\\"  The hail storm was a good touch as was the thought that 'Tristan started a different tradition -- he died.\\"      Dr. Foster continually wore pants which were too short. Psychiatrists don't dress like eccentric college professors.  At his office on the campus, he looked like Zach with his Roman nose.  He tried to get across to his patients that there is \\"too much beauty to quit.\\"  The recreation of the accident at the end was self-explanatory.  I always thought that ghosts stayed around because they had been involved in mysterious deaths, not those involved in car wrecks.  Michael Feinstein has a heartrending recording of the song, 'Stay,' which interested me in this movie by the same title.  Listen to it and see if it affects you the same way.  I went to see this movie because of that song.  Both are quixotic.
B000002GFT|5.0|Simply put this disc is perfect.  In a style I like to call Celtic Psychedelia, Sandy Denny will send chills up and down your spine with her hauntingly beautiful voice.  I have owned this for about 15 years and have yet to tire of it.  It is timeless.
B000000OQF|5.0|This is an amazing CD. It's as good as a Greatest Hits. Welcome to the Jungle Paradise City, and Sweet Child of Mine are the most well known songs, It's So Easy is an awesome song, Mr. Brownstone has an amazing guitar riff in it, My Michelle is another great song, Think About You features an accoustic guitar in the chorus which sounds awesome, and Rocket Queen is an amazing ending to then CD and is one of my favourites. Just switch Out Ta Get Me and Nightrain for Knockin' on Heaven's Door and November Rain and you have the best songs G N' R ever did. This is probably the only CD of theirs worht getting if you're a casual fan but get the Velvet Revolver CD too.
B0000524CY|5.0|Back in 1973 when this terrifying shocker first came out, the reactions from movie audiences were all over the place. Some people came out of the movie nearly collapsing off of their feet; some people checked into therapy after seeing it; some people actually vomited in the theater; some people were so scared that they ran out of the theater and never came back. Whatever the reactions were, THE EXORCIST certainly has one of the most powerful reactions from any horror movie ever made. No one had any clue that director William Friedkin was out to make what is quite possibly the scariest film ever made of all time. After the first time you see this movie, even you will have trouble sleeping at night for at least a week.     Linda Blair is terrific as the little girl who goes to hell and back, Regan; Max Von Sydow is terrific as Father Merrin; Jason Miller plays Father Karras to a tee; and Ellen Burstyn is perfect as Regan's mother. All of these actors convey such depth and emotion, and Blair truly is terrifying when she becomes the demon and speaks in the demon's voice. It...is...shocking.    The story centers around a little girl named Regan, one of the nicest girls on the planet. She loves horses, plays games and jokes with her mother, and seems like the most down to earth kid. Little does she know of the terror that truly awaits her as the movie progresses. We know that Chris is an actress and quite a reputable one at that. As the movie goes on, Regan is getting a check up at the doctor's office when a most terrifying face is seen for a split second as she stares at the ceiling, and then suddenly she is quietly taken over by the demon. If you pause the movie right when the face comes up, you will get shivers down your spine. Just the way it looks at you and is smiling and the eyes, everything is just VERY scary. You won't notice it at first, but later Regan's behavior begins to change, especially after her outburst in the doctor's office. But it doesn't end there.As soon as Regan gets home, all the bad stuff begins to start unravelling one by one. One event that occurs where you know things are going terribly wrong is when Chris walks into the room and finds the windows all open with the chill in the air and Regan not under covers but facing down on her bed. The fact that you can see breath is chilling, but just knowing Regan is going to wreak havoc is absolutely terrifying. There are a two moments in the movie where \\"demon\\" Regan's head spins, but the first time you see it is dreadfully unsettling. According to Wes Craven, at that moment some lady got up from her seat, was screaming Spanish and ran out of the theater. The fact that director William Friedkin has no inhibitions about what he was going to show made the movie more powerful, minute by minute. Father Merrin has been made aware of the nature of Regan's \\"demonic\\" behavior by Father Karras, so they ultimately decide to perform an exorcism, and that scene between Regan, Merrin, and Karras has to be one of the most classic scenes in any horror movie. Everytime you hear the demon voice, see Regan in demon form, or see the bed shake or vomit spit, you jump back from your seat. It's a movie that's all about reaching deep down into the \\"chill\\" factor of your soul.     Despite the sheer terror and frightening scenes depicted in this movie, there is no real gore and no real sex in the movie, despite the scene involving Regan and the crucifix. The film is actually stronger without any of those elements, it's an ultimately terrifying experience. The actors; the suspense; the demon effects and makeup; the storyline. Every element in this film works better than any other horror movie made in history.     THE EXORCIST is at least one of the most horrifying experiences you'll ever witness in your life. Heralded as a classic by both critics and fans alike, this movie will stay in your mind for a long time. This is the most realistic and most documetary-like film about the portrayal of demonic possession. William Friedkin, you may have been genius, but this movie is pure madness...reach into the scare factor of your soul and watch THE EXORCIST...but never, I repeat, never watch it alone...and in the dark.
B0006L16N8|5.0|4 1/2 stars.  Lets not kid ourselves, this album is not on the level of OK COMPUTER or DARK SIDE OF THE MOON, but it definitely holds up to their previous efforts. There is definite progression from A RUSH OF BLOOD TO THE HEAD in regards to instrumentation and production; however the song in themselves are still pretty conventional.  In some ways this is an improvement on their second album in that both halves of the CD have their share of great songs.  I found Tracks 1 to 6 on A RUSH to be fantastic, and then it fell apart considerably towards the end (excluding the fantastic title track and Amsterdam).  Some might think the success has gone to Martin and Co's head, but we couldn't expect them to keep putting out Parachutes forever, surely? <br /> <br />High lights from this CD: <br />Square One <br />White Shadows <br />Fix You <br />A Message  <br />Twisted Logic
068484267X|1.0|I totally failed to \\"get\\" this banal, repetitious, and altogether uninteresting yarn.  I'm not sure which I dislike more:  its full compliment of bland run-on sentences or its total failure to paint a single, solitary character portrait. <br /> <br />About 1/4 the way through the book finishing it was reduced to a chore, although I'm certain literature professors the world 'round are in love with this meandering, yammering stinker of a book.  One last thing I'll throw out there:  I'm no prude by any possible stretch of the imagination, but the ending is a real prize.  Somehow we're all supposed to laugh along wisfully as he recounts a throw with a war veteran's wife.  Wow.  He convinces me with that disgusting story that he's nothing more than a classic selfish pig.  I actually lived through poverty and it taught me how to live life right.  It apparently taught him that low hanging fruit, whoever the owner and whatever the form, was his to pick.  What a classless scumbag. <br /> <br />Yuk, yuk, and yuk. <br /> <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book was fantastic!!!!!  It was electrifying, eye-opening, heart wrenching, and raw.  It gave a very honest and open insider's view on the horrific effects of drug use.  You could feel his pain, frustration, raw emotion, struggle, and determination.  A true document of the human spirit and testament of mind over matter.

B000AU9UYM|5.0|As for comparisons, Tim Burton's 'Batman' (1989) and 'Batman Returns' (1992) was a tribute to the best parts of the franchise.  If it is superior to this film in any way, it is the style of Tim Burton, keeping you consciously grounded in a comic-book-reality (e.g., the Joker's pistol with a 4-foot long barrel taking down the Batwing), while never taking off the dark edge off the heroes (which was Schumacher's sin).  Put simply, Burton's Batman installments were fun. <br /> <br />Similiarly, 'Batman Begins' (2005) keeps the darker edge of Burton's interpretation (including a suspicously similar looking costum), but that is where the similarities end.  This film has a much larger palette (beyond the world of Gotham), based more in a semi-real world (as was the case with 'Superman' (1978)) and indicative of a much deeper psychology within the nature of the title character.  The heroes and villians are painted in much greyer shades, and the title character's motive of simple revenge is dispensed with early in the film for headier explorations.  Batman is a very literary figure - a metaphor for the exploration of the connection between the id (fear, violence, revenge) and the superego (justice, family obligations). <br /> <br />Whether you like Burton's interpretation or this interpretation will depend on your own vision of this icon.  As films, both have excellent casts and both are worthy of 5 stars, even if for very different reasons. <br /> <br />The two-disc expanded version was released on the same day as the two-disc expanded versions of 'Batman', 'Batman Returns', and Schumacher's two installments and is loaded with the extras you come to expect from great DVDs (with the exception of deleted scenes).
B000001F3C|4.0|I bought two U2 album recently: The Joshua Tree and War.  I was highly disappointed by The Joshua Tree, of which I had high expectations.  But War is just great.  Apart from \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\", the album contains several outstanding songs like \\"The Refugee\\", \\"Surrender\\", \\"Seconds\\", \\"Drowning Man\\" and \\"Two Hearts Beat As One.\\"  U2 fans who loved the band's style in the 1980s but were disappointed by what came in the 1990s and 2000s should buy \\"War\\" at all costs!
0812550706|5.0|Before I start reading this book, I thought this must be one of those StarTrekish, SF Geek type of book. I have no choice but to read it because this book was part of my reading assignment for a computing class in college.<br /><br />But as I started reading, I find it hard to overlook and ignore the story with Ender Wiggin. Starting the first page, Card's story will play like an action movie in your head, but you can also feel that the story also deeply base on understanding of humanity, like any other great literatures. Simply put it, this is not one of those cheap, shallow, SF Superhero story. I am glad that my instructor has assigned this book for us to read.<br /><br />As for any of you who gave a bad review of this book, read again. You either didn't understand the story or you just don't care about humanity that much.<br /><br />Great Book! I totally recomment it!
B000002GKT|5.0|People throw the word classic around about a lot of recordings these days but here it fits. I keep hoping A & M will dig into the vaults and release an updated version of this album with some more material. Contrary to what another reviewer says, this album was recorded at the Fillmore East in NYC. I know because I was there. The material is from four shows over 2 nights (at the Fillmore bands played an 800 and 1130 show)and Humble Pie knew how to rock and they did it LOUD. Steve Marriott had been around for years and Peter Frampton was just a kid (20 when this album was recorded)but live is where this band really excelled. Steve Marriott always engaged the audience and got them involved which always made their live shows more fun. This recording really shows this band at their peak. They were pale in comparison after Frampton left. Buy this album if you want to hear loud hard rock the way it was meant to be played.
B00000J7J4|4.0|I go back a long way with Santana. When I purchased the vinyl version of ABRAXAS it was their latest release. Santana's first 3 albums are, for me, absolute classics. Needless to say I grew up with a different Santana than the one on this CD. I continued to purchase the odd Santana release here and there but admittedly lost touch with the band. I first heard the track SMOOTH on the radio while I was in Georgia and loved it from the get-go. I suspected it was Santana but wasn't sure when I first heard it but I loved the song anyway so I ended up getting the CD. <br /> <br />Overall it's a good disc with some fine performances. I especially like the tracks CORAZON ESPINADO, YALEO, LOVE OF MY LIFE, SMOOTH, MARA MARIA and PRIMAVERA. Clearly Santana is trying to reach a broader audience and there is nothing wrong with that but having said that, I stil prefer the Santana band from the first 3 albums. THAT was a jammin' band! Latin-flavored rock didn't get much better. <br /> <br />The younger crowd just now getting into Santana may very well like this disc but I would highly recommend the first 3 discs so they can see where Santana came from and how his well earned rep was built. I get the feeling Santana will stick with this new formula but hopefully he still has another ABRAXAS in him somewhere and gets it out. Oh yeah, this being called a 'comeback' CD is nonsense. Santana has always been making music, he didn't go away.
B000B5IPLK|4.0|I am in love with Alicia Keys. Her music is full of soul and passion and leaves me yearning for more. She is a performer who is able to reach back about 30 years and deliver music that is reminiscent of the 70's soul music scene. Her previous two albums laid the foundation for this Unplugged set and the result proves that Alicia is a true talent who doesn't rely on studio tricks to sell albums. She can step up to the mike and deliver a top notch unplugged performance. So why a four-star rating? Because of a few minor \\"hiccups\\". For one, I would've preferred a version of \\"Heartburn\\" that was closer to the album version than this slower version. She really cooked up a smokin' version of this song on the \\"Diary\\" album. I also would've like to hear some of her underrated gems like \\"Rock Wit U\\" and \\"Trouble\\" from \\"Songs in A Minor\\" CD as well as \\"When You Love Someone\\" and \\"Dragon Days\\" from the \\"Diary\\" album. These songs, in my opinion are far superior than some of the songs that ended up on this album. I also give her kudos for performing with Adam Levine of Maroon 5 on her rendition of \\"Wild Horses\\". This is simply another sign of Alicia's musical versatility. The closing set with Mos Def and Damian Marley also shows Alicia's ability to step into the hip hop and reggae arenas. She is truly unstoppable. You must pick up this set if you enjoy soul music with an edge. Alicia's the one!

B000B2YQX4|1.0|I am shocked, not by this album but by the positive reviews people have left for it here. PTA is a bit of boring noise with bad lyrics tossed in - except for Precious. Isn't it interesting that the first single, Precious, is like nothing else on the album? Guess someone realised it was best to release the only remotely catchy song to sell the otherwise boring cd.<br /><br />My suggestion - buy the single. If you are a huge fan then wait to get the album used. Bet all you positive reviewers will find many copies of this album in the used cd bins.<br /><br />As a side note, I love Industrial, noise and effects in songs, but they all seem so phoney here. Not my DM anymore. Sorry guys it's a mistake.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I Loved this series when it first aired, and was sorry to see it cancelled. But after watching the DVD's, I was reminded of just how good the series was. Firefly, takes place 500 years in Earth's future, and follows the avdentures of the crew of the spaceship, Serenity. The series theme is good Sci-Fi, and the show also has a Great sense of humor, with interesting characters. I think once you watch the first few episodes, you'll be hooked. I know I sure was. Enjoy!!!
B0006399FS|4.0|I bought this earlier this year. It is my first U2 album. I know that may be stunning to many but I just thought I'd try out their latest stuff and work my way backwards to their masterpiece the Joshua Tree. I've always been intrigued by Bono and The Edge's songwriting that I hear on the radio be it With Or Without You, One, or Beautiful Day. <br />Upon my first listen and repeated listens I find this to be a very strong album.  <br />Bono's vocals are crisp and The Edge plays guitar with such and awesome sound that one can only admire it and not the song. <br />I can't pick a favorite track because they are all good in their own way. U2 fans snicker and gawk but regardless of all of that, this IS a good album by a group that has decided to do things differently now. And it's great. The lyrics are extremely meaningful, and while it is not their better work it is a fine piece of music for anyone who is willing to listen.  <br />I give it 4 stars for some standout tracks and some that are  not as strong. However, all are good. <br /> <br />Standouts: <br /> <br />Sometimes You Can't Make It On Your Own. <br /> <br />Comment: It's beautiful and really my favorite track. The guitar is great here. <br /> <br />A Man And A Woman. <br /> <br />Comments: They lyrics and smart strumming make this song captivating and really nice. Bono displays his upper registry nicely here. <br /> <br />Original Of The Species. <br /> <br />Comments: This song is epic and lovely with beautiful strings, guitar, and vocals. A GREAT love song. <br /> <br /> <br />Overall: This again, is a good album and my starting point to enjoy a band by going backwards and discovering their great many songs. I will buy their next album. <br />They still are the biggest and best band. <br />Eat your heart out Coldplay. <br />
B000000OQF|5.0|guns and roses appettite for destruction is a really good cd. the songs on it are awesome. buy this cd, its the best guns n roses album ever and if you havent heard them yet, even the more reason to get it. <br /> <br />           GUNS N' ROSES ROCKS!!!!!!!!!!!!!
B0002EXH40|5.0|Youthanasia marked the continuing evolution of Megadeth. Following in the footsteps of what the previous album (Countown to Extinction) started, Youthanasia displays a tighter, more melodic sound than its preceding albums. Indeed, Youthanasia is a far cry from the unmerciful, reckless riffing of Rust In Peace. No speed metal here. But that's not to say the album isn't heavy, it's just more refined and structured, relying more on choruses and lyrical content than an overabundance of guitar riffs.    Dave Mustaine's life has been a rollercoaster of twists and turns. With this album, he decided to pen them into song. Truly, it is the lyrics that make this work stand out. Mustaine presents emotional, often personal, words that add an extra element to each tune. Check out \\"Addicted to Chaos\\", a song about Mustaine's former drug rehab official dying of an overdose himself. Gripping stuff. Also, the guitars for the track \\"Train of Consequences\\" actually SOUND like a train chugging down the tracks.     Overall, Yourthanasia has a lot of positives going for it. There are very few weak songs, and this is the one Megadeth album that I can listen to straight through without skipping tracks. The production is so good that it's almost overly done, and the artwork is both beautiful and disturbing at the same time.     To be fair, not everyone is fan of Youthanasia. Some prefer the more aggressive style of the 80's. However, this is a fantastic album and I would give it to anyone, even those who are unfamiliar with Megadeth. Anyone with an appreciation for music should find this album enjoyable.
B000001F29|5.0|Yes, if you like Yes you'll like this disc. This album is a very unique portrait painted by two very talented musicians who were at the top of their craft during this time. Jon has never sounded better and the combination with Vangelis is magical on this disc. Get a copy of this music immediately unless of course...you're allergic to good music.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Playing the Angel is a bit better than Exciter, but that isn't saying much. With this new album, DM try to reinvent themselves... by ripping off their own classics and still failing to make anything good or unique. When I heard the single \\"Precious,\\" I knew the music sounded familiar; I thought it was a remix of Enjoy the Silence until Dave's vocals started up. Also, the lyrics are an issue. Typical, cliched bullsh*t that any and every \\"tormented\\" 14 year-old goth teenager scrawls in their poetry journal from Hot Topic. Really, the lyrics are embarrassing. There's no way three guys nearing their 50's would describe their problems in real life the way they do on this album. And why the fu*ck is Martin still painting his nails black and whining about how he's supposedly a \\"sinner\\"? Plenty of dumbasses like him have alcohol and marital issues, but you don't see them waxing poetically about it; they go to freakin' Alcoholics Anonymous meetings. All this and more makes Playing the Angel hilarious. Playing the Angel is downright immature lyrically and musically outdated with all its very scratchy bleeps & blips. I suggest Ultra, Songs of Faith & Devotion, and Violator instead.
B0002IQHY8|5.0|This disc forges new ground in the frontier of sound. Alan has always had the ability to be at the forefront of creative and innovative electronica. The people who are objecting to this music must not realize how much influence AP has had on electronic music through the years. Songs like Mammagamma and I Robot were the 'Electronica' of the 70's and 80's. Parsons was the most accesible of them all - Unless you wanted to listen to Kraftwerk. Return to Tunguska is a fantastic, fantastic tune. David Gilmour's guitar enhances the overall otherworldly effect of this song. Mammagamma is a reworking of the original '82 version. There is a newness and clarity to this particular version. I think it does the original justice and adds plenty more sonically. L'arc en Ciel is the very best song. Instrumental magic. The Raven is another reworking of a classic cut. Bravo! Well done. Updated, yet retaining the original emphasis. David Pack sings on \\"You Can run\\" and I can honestly say it doesn't sound like anything he's ever done (Ambrosia or AP) but it is a good tune. Fast paced with a dash of sampling. Not all the cuts on this disc are electronica. A pretty good mix of both instr/vocal.
B00005BL2A|1.0|As far as I'm concerned, the decline of Depeche Mode started here, with the ill-named Exciter. Ultra had several songs that could truly be called classics (It's No Good, Insight, and Home) just like every DM album before it. There is not one classic to be found on Exciter or even the new Playing the Angel (on which the band tries to rip off their own classics and fail miserably, but that's another review). Exciter is unquestionably Depeche Mode's worst release. Dave has officially lost all the power and passion he ever had, which is so sad. Where is the booming deep voice he once had? He had it on Ultra, so what happened? Dave wastes his voice as he whispers through such clunkers as Dream On. The song Sweetest Condition is cringe-worthy; Dave gives the closest Brit-playing-hick impression you'll ever see from him \\"Takin' hold of the hay'm [hem] of your dress.\\" Depeche still are one of my favorite bands (for Speak & Spell to Ultra), but they are now a parody of their former selves. Admit it, people.  <br /> <br />Songs not sleep-inducing and/or embarrassing to listen to while with friends: <br />I Feel Loved <br /> <br />That's it. <br />
B000002UA0|5.0|This is where everything you love about Pink Floyd all started. <br />Sure the music changed but all the roots and elements that make Pink Floyd are here. <br />The experimenting and boldly going where no rock band has gone before and the begining of great music influence that would influence every progressive rock band is all right here.  <br />Syd Barret was one of the most creative songwritters ever and it all ended with acid. Pink Floyd was able to manage because they actually stayed away from drugs for the most part after Syd was the first victim and drug tragedy rock star in the 1960's. We can all learn a lesson from this!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! <br />Syd Barret wrote songs that were like brilliant imagination from a childrens book or even about space travel from a sci-fi novel. This guy wrote songs like nobody else. <br />All the songs on this album are great but I will talk about a few highlights............ <br /> <br />Well the song Astronomy Domine is one of the first space rock songs ever written about space travel and sounds like music from a science fiction movie or in a Dr.Who episode.I think this is the song that showed every sign of what Pink Floyd would be doing later in theur career especialy the space travel sounds of a Saucerful of Secrects and Dark Side of the Moon and many of the effects on the songs Echos and One of these Days. <br />Astronomy Domine is a song that is the most unlike anything else in its day. <br />The other space song Interstellar Overdrive is better on the other version not on this album version in my opinion but it is alright although I think the other version found on Pink Floyd 1966-67 is much more incredible and is a little older and recorded before this album. <br />Chapter 24 is one of my favorites and kind of has an Indian feel to it with the keyboards sounding as eastern as if it were coming from a sitar. <br />Oh by the way the funny thing about this album is sometimes you cant tell which sound it coming out of which instrument. No it's not like Deep Purple when they all hit the same cords at the same time in a big jam which is also really cool. They move in different directions and being expects at sounds and blending in they can fool the human ear. Sometimes you mistake the bass for the drums and the other way around of the keyboards and guitars can be mistaken for each other also. It makes the album sound even more psychedelic and very musical like a symphony.     <br />The rest of the album really comes together well and every song is a pschedelic gem. Psychedelic rock changed a ton in 1967 and Pink Floyd and the Beatles had a ton to do with it because this album with the Beatles Sgt. Peppers blew everyone else away. <br />2 of the most incredible psychedelic or should I say any type of record in any musuc catagory were recorded and there was nothing else like it.   <br />The difference here is that like the Beatles with Sgt Peppers Pink Floyd was turning music into art. <br />This would quicky make progressive rock come alive and the quality of music would go to a greater level. <br />The songs in this album are not like anything else recored on its release date and influenced what many would try to do simular after or even in 1967 after hearing this album. <br />Here are influences you may have not known about or known little about that came from Pink Floyd debut album. <br />This albums influences are the reason why the Beach Boys had a great album in \\"Pet Sounds\\" which is the only Beach Boys album I like at all and The Beach Boys Bryan Wilson was one of Pink Floyds earliest and biggest fans. <br />David Bowies 1969 hit Space Oddity is one of the most influenced Syd Barret songs from this album that you can see very clearly with no doubts at all and he was a big fan. <br />This album was also recorded in the same studio at the same time as the Beatles \\"Sgt. Peppers\\" and both bands admit and laugh about how they heard on each other and copied each other. Listen to both albums and you will see why there is so much controversy over this on the 2 greatest psychedelic rock albums ever made! <br />It doesn't matter to me anyway because its pretty cool that both bands are the greatest ever and it was like they were recording 2 separate albums together while helping each other with a little help from their friends in the rooms nearby and both band joke about it and dont take it personally.
B000002KN8|3.0|Speak & Spell is a fine album. My main beef is that the U.S. version lacks one of my favorite Depeche Mode songs ever: the brooding \\"Dreaming of Me\\" b-side \\"Ice Machine.\\" Plus, \\"Shout\\" is missing, which I really hoped would be here. Other favorites of mine from the Speak & Spell era are \\"Photographic\\" and \\"Puppets\\" (which were both much more powerful and downright AMAZING when played live). It's ironic that two of my favorite DM songs were written by Vince Clarke, especially considering the fact the only Erasure song I like is \\"Oh L'Amour\\". As you can tell, I'm more fond of the 'serious' songs off Speak & Spell (\\"Tora Tora\\" is excellent as well), but there are obviously some great upbeat tunes to be found. \\"Dreaming Of Me, \\"Boys Say Go!,\\" and especially \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" can be included on that list.  <br /> <br />3.5 stars for the U.S. version. If this contained \\"Ice Machine\\" and \\"Shout,\\" I'd give it 4.
B0000VCZKM|1.0|For little girls and girly men only! <br />I saw this movie when it first came out in 1982 and have never seen a movie worse or more girly since. YUCK! <br />This movie is not only bad but it is sheer torture! <br />I remember how painful it was to go to this movie in 1982.   <br />If only my parents could have gotten a babysitter while I went to this movie with my sisters. <br />Star Wars was my favorite movie in the world and I wanted to see it again and again and again.  <br />NOT ANNIE! NOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO! <br />Help me Obi-One Kenobi your my only hope! <br />Watching Annie was one of the most traumatic events I suffered through in my childhood that I have never been able to recover since.  <br />I suffer from post-traumatic syndrome from watching Annie! <br />What could be more cruel than to take a 7 year old to a movie theater to see Annie? <br />\\"Somebody pinch me please.\\" Yes I remember the lines in the movie because they haunt me and I heard them over and over again with that soundtrack my sisters listened to and I wanted to step on the freakles of that cassette tape but couldn't because I would get in trouble and would have to buy another copy that would make it last longer and before the time it got old with my sisters. <br />This movie is worse than Anne of Greene Gables! <br />That is saying a ton! What could be worse? <br />Anne of Green Gables takes a whole day to watch and the sheer torchure of Annie outdoes Anne of Greene Gables 50 million times more in just 90 minutes! <br />If you like musicals don't see this movie. <br />If you like movies don't see this movie. <br />If you like DVD's dont see this movie. <br />If you like television don't see this movie. <br />If you like life PLEASE don't see this movie. <br />I think you get the picture now! <br />And if you have seen this movie you probably know what I am going through. We ought to form our own support group and get help and a possible recovery from most of it since it is not fully curable. THE PAIN! THE PAIN! THE PAIN! THE AWFUL PAIN! <br />If Daddy Warbucks offered to leave me with his entire fortune to see this movie I would say no! <br />If PoonJab used his all his magical powers to make me watch this movie it would not work. <br />If Miss Hanagen wanted me to nibble on her ear I would hire Mike Tyson do it for me and get out of watching Annie!  <br /> <br />  <br />     <br />
0812932293|5.0|This is by far the best autobiography or biography I had ever read. It's no exaggeration to say that it's far more intriguing and \\"unbelievable\\" than most of the novels. Luckily enough we know it's a real guy and we saw what he did, dyslexia, a secondary school dropout, editor of a student magazine, opening a mail order record company, record store, Virgin Records, first man to cross the Altantic, Pacific on a balloon, Virgin Atlantic...... Seemingly a maniac but truly a born enterpreneur who knew and took \\"controlled\\" risk.<br /><br />Most importantly, if what he wrote was 90% true, that he had privatized in 1988 the once public Virgin Group with double the market price (70p) so that all shareholders could get back what they paid in the 1987 IPO (140p) just before the 1987 market collapse, and he had distributed the 500,000 pounds he got from BA for libel compensation as bonus to his Virgin Atlantic staff, then, Sir Branson, I salute you.<br /><br />In short, a must read. Dont miss it. Looking forward to a Part II for stuff after 1993.....The short epilogue for things after 1993 is just too short and incomplete.
B000002UAU|5.0|Before I write my review I will put an end to all the misconceptions of this album and Pink Floyd in the studio that are correct to a point but I have the real info here.I did my homework many years ago being an obsessed fan of The Beatles and Pink Floyd. <br />In 1967 The 2 most advanced and revolutionary psychedelic albums were recorded in the same studio around the same time. <br />The Beatles \\"Sgt.Peppers\\" and Pink Floyds \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\". Not Dark Side of the Moon which was released in 1973 and a customer claims the Beatles were copying and this album and DSOTM does not sound anything like Sgt.Peppers. <br />What was this customer smoking? I'm a fan of the music but I have never used drugs so I guess I need to understand where this person is coming from and not judge the poor guy. <br />Anyway the 2 bands could hear each other and both bands admit it and even laugh about it. It's not about who copied who because both bands admit they heard each other and had a few ideas they borrowed from each other. Both bands are proven great bands and who cares about who copied or did what because the 2 bands were friends with each other and were 2 great influences that only caused greatness in the 60's and their sound is treasured today. <br />The review: <br />Sgt. Peppers has many simularities to Pink Floyds \\"The Piper at the Gates of Dawn\\" and the more I listened to both over the years the more I noticed it. But this review is for the Beatles and I will have one for Pink Floyd separate. The thing I love the most about this album is that it is art and rivals movies,books, and any kind of art in every form.  This album like many does what 18th century composers did with story telling lyrics and an album cover that make an album like a book or movie with a story to unfold with special effects and surprises. I have listened to this album probably 200 times since age 13 when I had it on cassette. There is so much in this album I will never be able to listen toit over and over again without picking up new sounds and themes and questions. This album is like a mystery and sci-fi movie or book and has more elements that are put into many movies and books combined and is an adventure different from any other. I love the Beatles album Revolver which my all-time favorite but it is this album that shows in true form of Lennon/McCartney as what they are known for in being legends and 2 of the greatest songwritters and composers. You can't even describe what the Beatles did here and very few albums have been able to make an impact like this album had. Thanks to this album by the Beatles and Pink Floyds work we have have progressive rock bands do almost the same thing and took rock to the highest ground it had ever been on. Rock never rivaled classical music until stuff like this was written and the ones who kept the revolution going made some of the best music ever. <br />The Moody Blues, Genesis, Jethro Tull, and King Crimson all came out after and are what great music is all about with music in pure art form. <br />Oh yes and to compliment another reviewer Frank Zappas concept idea came first (You are right) and than Paul McCarntney liked the idea to do it also and The Beatles came up with one of the greatest albums ever. Yes everyone borrows from everyone somewhere most of this album is nothing short of origiality that only came from the Beatles themselves. <br />  <br />
B00001W9G0|5.0|I want to strangle Hubbell when he says this final line at the end!  But my rage is just an indication of how much I adore this movie! <br /> <br />I think people who giving a low rating to the film because of the incorrect portrayal of the communist movement, and whatever, are missing the mark of this movie entirely.  The Way We Were is a love story, first and foremost.  Communism is just a circumstance that complicates the love story.  It is NOT in my opinion, the central theme of the movie. <br /> <br />That being said, TWWW  is a classic story of \\"love isn't enough.\\"  I think Katie and Hubbell love each other deeply, but they are such different people.   She wants him to be everything that she believes he is.  (Whether he is or isn't those things is debatable.)  But he is content living a safe, yuppy life.  He needs a girl who can just roll with that lifestyle, hence, he ends up with the nameless girl at the end of the film.  She represents the safe type of girl that is pretty enough to keep Hubbell interested and safe enough to allow him to live his yuppy life. <br /> <br />It's clear in the scene at the end that the love between them is still strong.  You can feel the heat of that final embrace through the screen!  I could go on and on about why this movie is one of the greatest, but I can't.  See this film.
B000002KFJ|5.0|This album was definately the last truly great Sabbath album with Ozzy.It's not the best (the best being either Paraniod or Master of Reality), but it's still damn good. The drums are solid, the bass is heavier then ever, Ozzy's vocals are great, but the centerpeice instrument of this album is definately Tony Iommi's guitar, which seems to always dominate. Another interesting thing about this album is the lyrics, unlike most albums before, which dealt with religioin and crime mostly, this album seems quite focused on the mental state of people. Anyway, on to the track-by-track review <br /> <br />Hole In The Sky - opens the album with possibly the best riff that Sabbath ever came up with. 10/10 <br /> <br />Don't Start - Most people would consider this 40 second acoustic guitar solo filler, I myself think that its a wonderful showcase of Iommi's guitar, but it's still too short. 5/10 <br /> <br />Symtom Of The Universe - Biggest hit in the album, but not my favourite. Check out the softer acoustic ending and solo, I think it's really cool. 8/10 <br /> <br />Megalomania - My personal favourite track on the album. starting out slow and depressing, only to end up with arguably the heaviest, most intense song on the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />The Thrill of it All - Mediocre rock song. Lots of complicated arangements made though. 6/10 <br /> <br />Supertzar - Really cool instrumental which features a vocal choir which really intensifies the whole song by quite a bit. <br />8/10 <br /> <br />Am I Going Insane? - The only song that truely doesnt belong here. Fortunetely the greatness of the other songs makes it irrelevent to the album. 3/10 <br /> <br />The Writ - Closes the album with another contendor for \\"The Heaviest Song On The Album\\". Lyrically, this one is all about how record company's don't care about the artists, they only care about the money the artists are getting them. Great song. 9/10 <br /> <br />   If you're a fan of Black Sabbath with Ozzy Osbourne, then this album NEEDS to be in your collection. I really consider it the last album with Ozzy because the next two (Technical Ecstasy and Never Say Die) were brutally unfocused and downright terrible.
B00005JNBQ|1.0|...I'd rather be watching the World Series.  On Fox.  How desperate am I?   <br /> <br />Gave it 15 minutes, and I wanted to shoot the kid.  And I support gun control.   <br /> <br />Help me.  Please.
B000AU9UYC|4.0|After the recent series of big screen Batman films one wonders how a film titled \\"Batman Begins\\" could add anything to the story, but this one does.  Former films describe the tragedy of his parent's death then jump to his adult crime-fighting career.  Most Batman fans know he received special Ninja training during those missing years.  This film fills in the gaps and fits nicely with the films that have gone on before.  This is one of the better Batman films.  I wonder where they will go from here?  Will they continue to blaze new trails or settle for telling the old story in new ways?
B00004XONN|5.0|This is the best Radiohead album.  It's not for everyone.  It's a mood piece.  Like a bad acid trip.  Don't put it on if you're in a good mood.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|i am shocked to see some one-star reviews from on-line reviewers. These are not true Depeche Mode fans!  This is there best album since Songs of Faith and Devotion, maybe better.  As the album cover states'\\"pain and suffering in various tempos\\"., Depeche Mode returns with a more dance hall friendly album.  Granted \\"Exciter\\" was sonically different and alienated some fans, but this new album has great songs throughout, especially Precious, John the Revelator, Suffer Well, Nothings Impossible. If you are marginally a Depeche Mode fan, pick up this CD and marvel at the fact that David Gahan has gone through so much with his drug addictions, yet Martin Gore writes all the music and lyrics, with David in mind.  It doesn't get much better than this!!
B00003CXA2|5.0|Tom Hank's plays the stupid Forrest Gump who somehow went to college played football how he made the team the football coach saw Forrest running on the field. Their team became champion's and went to the white house to meat JFC. Forrest drank too much drinks and had to go pee. Forrest got his degree then went to the army he fought in Vietnam and earn the highest metal the army can give you (The Congressional Medal of Arnor) then Forrest pulled his pants down.
B00005JLPK|4.0|I am a big Kahlo fan, and had read several books about the great painter before watching this DVD. I had even written a 30 page paper about the life of Frida for a college course. Therefore, I was a bit shocked when I saw that the Frida Hayek portrays in this movie has little to do with the real life Frida. For instance, Salma is far too beautiful in the film. It is not that Frida was ugly, but she did not look so stunning, neither. Second, Kahlo had such a crippled body she was in constant pain. It is the representation of her physical and mental pain that makes Kahlo's paintings so powerful, but Hayek totally overlooks this, and instead portrays the painter as a physically healthy woman, who can even climb pyramids.  These and other inaccuracies made me give the film four stars only. However, everything else in the film is outstanding, especially the acting, sets, and score.    Most importantly,  Hayek has introduced Kahlo to a wider audience, and in the end this is what matters. In this respect, the film succeeds 100%.
B000ANVQ0K|1.0|James Cameron, one of the coolest directors of sci-fi films such as Aliens and the Terminator films released one of biggest steamimg piles of crap in cinematic history when he dropped this turd.  It's absolutely unforgivable especially when you consider that godawful song from Celine Dion that was played repeatedly on the radio.  The worst thing of all is that after this Cameron only makes stupid Titanic documentary films when he could be making something actually worth seeing.  Oh yeah, and how all of those stupid kids who are on boats who like to get at the end of it and say the \\"king of the world\\" crap like it's so clever.  Freakin' stupid.  Freakin' stupid movie too so spend your money elsewhere.  Go get Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right DVD.  A better use of your money instead of wasting it on this cinematic turd pile.
B0000931QR|5.0|The songs are extreeeemely cathcy, but it doesn't mean they are shallow or uninteresting, quite the opposite - they are catchy and clever. <br />The vocalist has a very sweet voice which blends very well withe the music. <br />I bought the CD because I had listened to a sample, which I found intriguing,  in iTunes. <br />It is nice to listen to the CD while reading or resting, drinking a nice soft drink.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Unlike Batman Begins which appempts to make a comic book more realistic (until the end of the movie where they drop the ball completely) this movie knows what it's supposed to be.  It's an over the top fictional world and a pretty darn cynical one at that to the point that even its cynicism is over the top.  I really enjoyed this.  It's a disjointed story with various different plot threads that have a few connections with characters from previous ones appearing in certain scenes which are obviously not in chronological order since some people have already died in a previous scene.  The film has a very unique visual style of the likes I've never really seen before.  It's like a comic come to life and it was very well done.  Also, if you don't like seeing people's faces smashed into a bloody pulp you may want to skip this because it was pretty violent.  However, some of it is done in some creative ways such as the blood being a different color or a person being ripped to pieces in silhouette form.  Great film.  Along with this check out Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right Live.  Two great releases.  Pick em' up.
1587990717|3.0|I found this book to be very thought provoking. In fact, I have given copies to a few friends. However, it is extremely self serving and in many places incorrect.  <br /> <br />For example, Mr. Talebs description of the scientific process is just wrong. One view is that science proceeds from a hypothesis, the world is round, to a verififiable fact, the world is round, not to a probability, there is a .98 chance the world is round. The hypothesis often is a product of intuition. The helical structure of DNA was first hypothesized and then verified, not statistically estimated.  <br /> <br />Mr. Taleb's interjection of himself really makes this more of a memoir than a treatase and leaves me with no desire to ever meet him. It crosses the border into egotism.
B000AARKOO|3.0|I was suprised with this one since I had heard such bad things about it.  I expected it to be a complete trainwreck but it wasn't.  Sure, it has some problems.  Everything seemed kind of rushed to me.  Specifically, the training sequence with Neeson's character.  I think he trained in about 30 seconds before getting in an actual fight.  No montage or anything.  From what I've heard there's actually supposed to be a longer director's cut edition planned and a lot of footage was removed from this version.  Maybe when the extra footage is added it will get a 4 star rating from me.  However, I do have to say I wish Ridley Scott would do some stranger films since he's done two epics already.  Maybe go back to sci-fi since he created Alien and Blade Runner, two films that are superior to this one.  Kingdom of Heaven is a very underrated film so pick it up.  Another good release you should pick up is Skinny Puppy's Greater Wrong of the Right Live.  Two great films.  Check them out.
B000B9EY2U|5.0|i am quite amazed at some of the negative reviews here. <br />this is depeche mode back in full form which i did not think was ever possible ever since alan wilder left the band.ben hillier should be praised for his production on this album.it sounds like violater 2 to me. <br />it has the depth and experimentation which was poorly lacking with there last two albums but at the same time creating some amazing tunes. <br />this is one of there best albums ever.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I laugh reading all these true \\"fans\\" who say this album is boring or too slow.  Which is fine to have this opinion because all music is relative, but these \\"fans\\" write like DM has never put out an album that hasn't have ballads or slow songs.  These are the fans who if they don't hear another Violator or MFTM, they'll say DM has lost it and the album is bad.  While I'll admit this isn't they're best album, particularly lyrically, I believe it has something for everyone who is familiar with DM.  It still contains all the elements of what makes a DM album, ballads, groovy stompers, industrial beats, synth beats, Daves unique voice and brooding songs.  Which all have remain true since A Construction Time Again.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Just one step below great... The visuals are awesome of course <br />and so is the acting. Bruce Willis is a cop that just can't come <br />to terms with the fact that he is aging and is just about out <br />of the game. <br /> <br />It's an action packed and gory thrill ride. Yes, it's a comic <br />book thing, but you believe in the characters and they feel <br />real. All three stories manage to keep your interested through <br />out the entire two hours. Out of all the stories I'd say  <br />Mickey Rourke is my favorite as the beastly looking man out  <br />to get revenge for the men that killed his hooker girlfriend. <br /> <br />It's rare to have a movie be really good eye candy and actually <br />good at the sametime. Either a movie has a good story and lacks <br />action, or it has good action and lacks any kind of story. <br /> <br />Btw, Rosario Dawson is hot in this one! And Bruce Willis seems <br />to be getting it back together alittle bit with his solid B <br />movie Hostage and now this.

B000002MU3|1.0|After the sweeping, rocking, sophisticated REM album of REM albums, \\"Automatic,\\" the boys were going to tour. Michael said in an interview that they wanted to rock, so they put the keyboard aside and crafted these 'toons on the guitar, plugged and distorted. The result was a total load of \\"stuff.\\"<br /><br />I have never been so disappointed with an album. I've carried the pain since 1994. I can't say that they've ever gotten close to \\"Automatic\\" again.
6304711891|5.0|The Rock is directed by Michael Bay. Don't listen to all of the critics saying what a horrible director he is. He works with what he's given. Anyway, The Rock star Sean Connery, Nicholas Cage and the much underrated Ed Harris. A solid story line moves the film along at a good fast pace. The action and special effects are top notch. There's also some very funny moments throughout. Nicholas Cage and Sean Connery make a great team and  <br />Ed Harris gives a great performance as a general who makes sense. <br />If you want to sit back and have a great time, its a great edition to your collection. Thanks for listening
0679422714|4.0|Jung Chang and her partner are clearly on a mission to destroy any myths that may still surround the man whose face still dominates Tiennamen Square in Beijing. There is no question about their authoritative research and the consistent and damning picture they paint of Mao as a despot, mass murderer - a strange, contradictory man who wielded awful power while entertaining personal passions for the things he openly despised. He taunted the USA, but loved things American. He portrayed himself as a kindly avuncular man - a man with a strict moral core. In person he could be described as depraved, a bully who quelled any opposition.<br /><br />The authors' sense of mission is too palpable to the extent that this biography is as unrelenting as a war crimes tribunal. It makes for a somewhat explosive read about the man who perhaps wielded the greatest political influence of the 20th Century.<br /><br />- Mao's participation in the Long March was to be literally carried the whole way.<br />- His economic mismanagement led to an estimated 30 million deaths by starvation. Peasants, whom Mao (never a man of the people) treated with disdain, were reduced to eating bark off trees. In some cases whole villages formed suicide pacts rather than continue in oppression and deprivaiton.<br />- Mao, who used \\"self-criticism\\" as a tool to humble his rivals, was incapable of self criticism. He was vindinctive toward those - such as Liu and Peng - who courageously attacked Mao because of the economic woes bought on by the tragic \\"Great leap Forward.\\"<br /><br />The subject matter is very important and I'd personally suggest reading this volume in conjunction with two other books: neither are by apologists for The Chairman.<br /><br />The first is Dr Li Zhisui's excellent memoir \\"The Private Life of Chairman Mao\\" which tells of Mao from the perspective from inside Mao's court. Zhisui served as physician for Mao and his tyrranical wife Madame Mao, and if Mao - The Unknown Story depicts a maelstrom of violence, then Dr Zhisiu tells of the somewhat reclusive existence of Mao.<br /><br />Second: I'd recommend Jung Chang's own groundbreaking book \\"Wild Swans\\" which tells the story of Mao's China from the points of view of a well-connected Chinese family.<br /><br />Mao was a tyrant, but I feel Jung Chang has worked so hard to hammer her points home (her research is extensive and authoritative) that we lose some of the roundedness that we might expect from such an important work. Make no mistake, this is an excellent book - and a powerful read. The tragedy is that the Chinese Government - whose policies are now much more progressive - still remains in a state of denial when it comes to Mao. His portrait still dominates Tiannemen Square.tells of the somewhat reclusive existence of Mao.

0380729407|5.0|Bam! All of a sudden, Will Halloway and Jim Nightshade find themselves caught between a fight of good vs. evil.  <br />   I thought 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' was an excellent science fiction/ fantasy book and this book is definitely a book for people who enjoy scary stories. <br />   Charecters that the book mostly revolves around are Will Halloway, Jim Nightshade, Charles Halloway, Mr. Dark, Mr. Cooger, and other freaks of the carnival. The book Mostly takes place in the month of October at a carnival and soon mysterious things start to happen to the boys when they arrive at the carnival. The force of evil is so great that they can't control the situation by themselves. They must get help from Will's father to help defeat the evil. <br />   To me this was a great book and they best part of the book was when Charles Halloway carves a smile onto a fake, dissolvable bullet and kills the Dust Witch with the smile and goodness. The reason that the Dust Witch died is because of the happiness that was on the bullet. This was the most exciting part of the book to me because when Bradbury describes the scene, the image is so vivid in your mind. Also, he has the power to stop time and seem as if the world stopped for a second when Halloway shot the bullet. <br />   If you are interested by this book, there are many other books that have been written by this author. These book consist of 'The Halloween Tree' and 'The Illustrated Man'. I really enjoyed this book because it is very exciting and i really recommend this book to everyone. For me this was a book in which i can't stop turning the pages until the book endds. I hope you are encouraged to read 'Something Wicked this Way Comes' becasue of this review and i hope taht you enjoy the book!
B000002ADT|5.0|What can I say, where to start?  When I first bought this I was a little let down.  It was my first Jazz purchase and I was looking to have at least a few more upbeat full band sounds, it was what I was imagining in my head.  But, after some listens, this immediately became my all time favorite musical journey everytime I listen to it.  I have since purchased other Miles albums (\\"Porgy and Bess is amazing\\") and my guitar playing has taken on another element of style (I've been playing for nearly 5 years).  \\"So What\\" remains my favorite track, the random adlib intro by Evans and Paul  Chambers is amazing, then the rest of the band follows suite.  Miles and Coltrane soloing is superb and Cannonball Adderley adds his own flavor.  I don't know what else to say, Miles is God, and that is my story and I'm sticking to it!
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Wonderful Series which was unfortunately cancelled before it matured. Great cast of characters, including 3 hot ladies. Another great idea and concept from the infamous Joss Wheaton. Too bad the Network didn't see it that way. I predict after the movie makes it's round in the theaters that it will be resurrected again and the series will have a very long run as did Buffy and Angel.  I hope so anyway.
0375758992|5.0|The cover of this book said that this is a book you don't read just once, and they were absolutely right! Alexandra Fuller's description of war-torn Africa and the effect it had on her family is a story that I will never forget.  The fact that she, her sister, and parents even survived at all, is a wonder, for they all lived under unbelievable odds. What makes Fuller an incredible story-teller? She never, ever scrimped on the details, which kept me involved in her story at every turn.  She has the rare ability to take the reader to exactly where she was at any point of her youth. Nothing was ever left out! She opened her soul for all to see, bad and good, dark and light. <br /> <br />To take me, the reader, back to a place again where I could smell the wetness of her dogs, the sweetness of her tea, and the smoky scent of Africa is exactly why I read this book again. She is an exceptional person and a truly gifted writer!
0953104907|5.0|The book was purchased for my son at his request and he seems to be very satisfied with the detailed instruction contained within. Lots of pictures to clearly show process steps in the making of a guitar. I recommend it for the beginner or novice interested in creating his or her own guitar. Focus is primarily on solid electrics.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|Once again, depeche mode have managed to create a new, fresh sound on the glorious Playing the Angel. But don't get me wrong, this is classic Mode. Many reviewers say this is the best album since Violator.  I don't know why everyone is still looking for a follow-up album to Violator.  Basically, they just want another Violator.  Depeche Mode is too much of a pioneering band to settle for doing what they've already done.  Playing the Angel is still way too new to me to know where it will fit in my DM catalogue.  But where Songs of Faith and Devotion took 3 months to \\"get\\" and Ultra took even longer, Playing the Angel has warmed up to me quite quickly.  It has the flow of a Black Celebration/Music for the Masses, the sound is a mix of the industrial sound of early depeche (post-Clarke) and the maturity of an Ultra/Exciter.  The result means I just cannot stop playing this thing.  And I'm not worried that I will tire of it because it is very \\"dense\\" and layered a la Songs of Faith and Devotion.  My favorite 3 DM albums are 1. Black Celebration - the definitive dm album 2. Violator - the masterpiece 3. Songs of Faith and Devotion - the second masterpiece.  Thanks Martin, Dave, and Alan for making this brilliant album.
B0009R1T7M|5.0|First let me say that we have been disappointed by the consisently solid this year.  Sigur Ros, Super Furry Animals, Weezer, Badly Drawn Boy...well the list goes on.  I have given up and eagerly awaiting the new Radiohead and Flaming Lips.  All of a sudden, I was recommended this album from a friend.  A friend who I trade quality music with on a regular basis.  The verdict?  Best of 2005, hands down.  I have heard of Sufjan Stevens and his quest for 50 albums spanning the state of the union.  Although I appreciate the lofty goal, I don't think he will get there.  I mean the Stones and Dylan haven't compiled that many albums over their illustrious careers.  But anyway, a relatively unknown knocked me off my feet with Illinose.  The first time I listened to this album, I was baffled.  Going in with little expectation, I have not been this impressed since the first time I listened to Soft Bulletin by the Lips.  It's a history lesson and melodic journey all in one.  The first 3 songs are absolutely mezmerizing until he goes into John Wayne Gacy Jr. which is beautiful and sick at the same time.  The rest of the album brings you up then down then back up again.  Strings, horns, male and female vox, sadness, beauty and overall satisfaction.  It is truly special.  It makes me sad that this music is not more accesible and that not more people are subject to this artist.  Check it out and will not be disappointed.  I have since purchased Michigan and Seven Swans.  Although not as special as Illinoise, definitely worth checking out if you like this one.

B0009HLDFU|5.0|I have been a fan since the Foo Fighters very first CD (Foo Fighters).  I have every one and by far this is the best because it shows the maturity in terms of musical composition.  I love it as I love ALL of the CDs this band has produced.  The range of composition really shines in this production and showcases the talent of this band.  And believe me when I say I am discriminating (having listened to rock/alternative for over 30 years, with a very wide range of over the years).  The Foo Fighters is one of the very best artists of our time and I am sure their music will stand the test of time. <br /> <br />The second CD is really something.  While I prefer the \\"harder rock\\" sound of most bands, the second CD is stellar and really shows us the musical talent that this band has, not just for playing but for composition and the range of musical ability.  Really something to admire. <br /> <br />As far as the copy protection goes - well, I understand the sentiment, but don't blame the band, blame the music company.  I should be able to copy for my personal use (I keep the originals unused and copy for my car and to carry)!  These guys deserve to be paid for their extroidinary gift to us.   We should fight the record companies on this, not the band.

B000AL730Y|5.0|I bought this cd sight unseen as I have all Paul Mcartneys cd's and have determined that this is perhaps the most soulful and well written material that I have heard from him in years. Oh not that he was ever been incapable of ever writing this kind of material. After all this is the same guy who gave us some of the most memorable and best written songs ever recorded. My how we forget. I saw Paul live in Chicago on October 19th, 2005 and let me tell you it was the best concert I have ever attended. I go to many. This man is beyond is legend. At 64 he is not only as creative as he has ever been. But I only hope that I have as much energy as he does at his age. He played for nearly three hours without a break. He has so much of a selection its hard to comprehend that he could probably go for 6 hours and still not cover it all. As far as I am concerned, his music played a huge part of my growing up. It was the best of times when the Beatles were in their heyday and oh my God he re-created that magic at the show that I saw. I thought I was going to be in tears when he did \\"Penny Lane\\". Its hard to imagine that this great music was written and sung so long ago. We all have short lives but was it not wonderful to hear \\"Help\\", \\"If fell in love with you\\", plus so many other wonderful tunes that were so much part of our lives. At least those who remember. Here he is again, producing a soulful new cd that reflects his heart and soul and all the creativity of a Beatle. I waved to Paul after the second encore when he broke into \\"Let it be\\" and I screamed Thanks Paul for all the music and the meories. I owe this man and the rest of the Beatles a debt of gratitude for all the enjoyment he has given me and all my relationships over the years. Thanks to Paul and all the Beatles. GOD BLESS!

B000ADWDF2|3.0|Michael Lundberg (Ulrich Thomsen) is a Major in the Danish Army about to be stationed in Afghanistan. His brother Jannik (Nikolaj Lie Kaas) has just been released from a stint in prison for assaulting a woman during a robbery. Michael is a warm, optimistic and idealistic family man. Jannik is the black sheep of the family who resents his brother's middle class self-righteousness and shows it by clinging to his irresponsible, self-pitying ways. Shortly after arriving in Afghanistan, Michael's helicopter is shot down, and he is believed dead. In fact, he has been captured by guerilla fighters. Back in Denmark, his wife Sarah (Connie Nielsen) grieves and tries to move forward with her 2 young children. No longer in Michael's shadow, Jannik strives, in his own way, to honor his brother's ideals.<br /><br />The performances in \\"Brothers\\" are admirable. Connie Nielsen is radiant in spite of sub-standard cinematography. The film is shot documentary style with what seems to be a handheld DV camera. It doesn't look good. There is noise in the shadows, light fall-off at the edges, and the camera moves too much. If filmmakers are going to use inexpensive DV, they could at least put the camera on a tripod and take a reasonable amount of care in setting up the shots. To the actors' and writers' credit, family scenes in the aftermath of Michael's presumed death held my interest. But I'm giving \\"Brothers\\" only 3 stars for the poor camera work and a striking lack of plausibility. I didn't find Michael's behavior in the Afghani prison camp to be the slightest bit credible. Not for a man of his personality. And half of the film hinges on it. I wonder if writer/director Susanne Bier and screenwriter Anders Thomas Jensen used Michael's experiences in the camp as a kind of short cut or short hand for a process by which someone might betray his own values. People do abandon their values, yes, but no one can abandon his nature. As this film is written, it's just not believable. Danish with English subtitles. The DVD (Universal 2005) has no bonus features, but subtitles are available in Spanish and French as well as English.h subtitles.

B0009WFFS6|4.0|I was afraid I'd be disappointed if I bought this Cream collection mainly because of The Eagles - Farewell 1 Tour - Live From Melbourne.  Instead of performing overblown arrangements of their songs with extra musicians and singers to help pad their vocals, it was just the three original members playing together.  Ginger Baker didn't need another drummer to back him up while he sang his epic fairytale \\"Pressed Rat and Warthog\\".  They don't frantically compete with each other like they used to, but the sound is full and their playing complements each other.  This is the way I always wanted to hear Jack Bruce's bass.  I don't miss the electric fart bass sound that Mel Schacher of Grand Funk emulated.  I haven't heard Clapton play with this much spirit in a long time and you harldy miss the sound of his Gibson SG and Marshall Stack.
B00097A5HW|5.0|I Love Shakira, she has the best voice in all music business from the whole world, I don't say this just because I love her, I say this because it's the truth and you have to admit it! Fijacin Oral Vol.1 is a masterpiece, it's awesome, the outstanding lyrics, and so strong vocals are completely amazing, I loved that she changed a little bit her style, I like new things, of course I've loved all of her albums since Magia. Shakira makes music something to love!  <br />Song rating: <br />1. En Tus Pupilas: An amazing song filled with some different touches, an amazing ballad.10/10 <br />2. La Pared: Interesting song, because of the topic and the title, for me it has a catchy chorus: \\"Despus de ti la pared no me faltes nunca, debajo el asfalto y ms abajo estara yo sin ti\\" de last part is my favorite. 10/10 <br />3. La Tortura: Her first single, a great mix of music styles, reggaeton, and some latin influences that make it an amazing song, and you can hear her amazing voice, what I don't like is that Alejandro Sanz's voice sounds so poor, I mean how could you compare both voices?10/10 <br />4. Obtener un s: A bossa-nova song it's really cool song and she plays with her voice in a funny and delightful way. 10/10 <br />5. Da Especial: I like this song but I would say it's the worst of the album, I will tell you the reason: It wasn't written by Shakira, you can notice that wherever you hear that song, so that's why I don't like it so much. That surprissed me, it's the first song that Shakira hasn't write, when I saw its credits I was impressed. I hope she keeps writing her own songs, she's an amazing songwriter!8/10 <br />6. Escondite Ingls: A good song, it's like the faster song in the album and it's kinda funny. Like it! 10/10 <br />7. No: Her second single, an amazing ballad, I love it, her voice is amazing and the lyrics are great, she sounds awesome in this song!10/10 <br />8.Las De La Intuicin: One of my favorites, I love the chorus that has like background vocals and it's a different touch. Lyrics are good.10/10 <br />9. Da De Enero: When I heard this song I totally loved it, it's dedicated to his boyfriend (Antonio De La Ra), and it's cool and fun! 10/10 <br />10. Lo Imprescindible: It's a cool different song I love to listen to, it's the last one (without counting the special versions of \\"La Tortura\\" and \\"La Pared\\")and it closes the album in an amzing way!10/10 <br />11 and 12: Amazing versions of the already amazing original songs! 20/20 <br />In conclusion: If you haven't bought this CD, buy it I'm really sure you won't regret it! If you don't like Shakira (what?) it doesn't matter, with Fijacin Oral Vol.1 you will grow to like her, I mean, to love her as I do (more is impossible)!
B0009X766Y|5.0|If you are a fan of \\"The Sting\\", purchasing this disc is a no-brainer. As for the arguement that this is not widescreen, I can only say that I have a 65inch widescreen television, and this picture fills the screen from top to bottom and side to side. The picture quality is exceptional. It has never looked better. The sound remix into 5.1 really adds to the experience of this wonderful music score. Extras are good, but the real reason for buying this disc is to experience the film in a way that has not been seen since its original theatrical presentation. <br />If you buy this disc, you will not be disappointed.
B000002E5J|5.0|This is my favorite album, not just Shakira's, in general, the only song I would say is not so good is \\"Pienso En Ti\\", but i like it too. <br />Each song is something perfect, the creative and perfectly written lyrics make it a masterpiece. <br />Song Rating: <br />1.

Pies Descalzos: Along with \\"Se Quiere...Se Mata\\" my favorite song, specially the cool and fun lyrics and her voice! The last part: \\"Saludar al vecino, acostarse a una hora...\\" it's my favorite, to sing it without breathing it's so hard. I love this song so much! <br />8. Vuelve: Cool song! Love the lyrics! So interesting! The music is sooo cool! <br />9. Pienso En Ti: It's a nice song (the one I like the least), but it's so slow so it gets boring, but I still hear it! It has the same thing that \\"Te Espero Sentada\\", you're waiting for \\"Dnde Ests Corazn? <br />10. Dnde Ests Corazn?: An amazing song, really fun and has some fast parts like \\"Pies Descalzos\\", \\"Estoy Aqu\\" and \\"Se Quiere...Se Mata\\"(my favorite part of the songs!)and I love it! <br />11. Se Quiere...Se Mata: Along with \\"Pies Descalzos\\", my favorite song! What I specially love is the story, the lyrics, it's an interesting story, funny and a perfect closing song to the perfection that \\"Pies Descalzos, Sueos Blancos\\" represents! <br />First I had the audio cassette (tape) when it got out and I bought theCD when I tragicly lost the tape!  <br />I'm glad I have it now and I never stop listenig to it! <br />Shakira Rocks! <br />Shakira Rules! <br />Shakira's The Best Singer From The Whole World!
1591396190|5.0|In this book, the authors give a formal and thorough presentation on creating a new market (a blue ocean), instead of engaging in the fierce competition of an overcrowded one (a red ocean). To me, they present a formal treatment of looking for gaps in an overall market which may be across more than one industry. Such a new product that can open a new blue ocean and make the competition irrelevant usually has the capability of providing consumers a unique combination of values at an affordable price. In addition, the authors also discuss the importance of keeping one's cost down for making a profit. <br /> <br />Besides providing a set of tools for strategic analysis, this book also discusses implementation success. Lastly, the long term sustainability and renewal of a blue ocean are the topics that conclude the book.  <br /> <br />The authors also review the history of blue ocean creation in three different industries in time, the different views of strategy, and an analysis of value innovation in the terms of Macroeconomics in the appendix sections of the book.  <br /> <br />This book is both academic and practical. It is very enlightening.  <br />

B00005J6T1|5.0|Madonna debuted with this record in late 1983, initiating the most successful female pop career in history.  At the time, disco was dead and dance music was verboten on pop radio.  Along with Shannon, Madonna helped bring dance music back into the mainstream.  Thus, although \\"Madonna\\" sounds like safe pop music now, it was actually pretty cutting edge at the time.  \\"Everybody\\" was her first single; it became a solid dance hit but didn't cross over to pop radio or the Hot 100.  With its unusual shuffling beat, it should have been a hit and still sounds great today.<br /><br />\\"Madonna\\" eventually yielded three pop hits, each one charting higher then the previous - Holiday (#16), Borderline (#10), and Lucky Star (#4).  \\"Borderline\\" was her first ballad, although relatively up-tempo.  Her voice is thinner here than it would be on later ballads, but she still sounds lovely.  The video was also a huge hit and introduced people to Madonna's breakthrough style.  I became aware of Madonna for the first time through that video and have been a fan ever since.  \\"Lucky Star\\" sounds a bit dated with too many synthesizers, although it's still a great pop song.  Although \\"Holiday\\" was the smallest hit, it's perhaps the most enduring of the three: a real party anthem.<br /><br />Along with these hits, the non-singles are also uniformly solid.  \\"Burning Up\\" is the closest thing to a rock song that Madonna made during her early years, although the guitars are paired with a terrific dance beat.  \\"Physical Attraction\\" is another highlight - a dance song that really shows off Madonna's sex appeal and slither.  \\"Think of Me\\" and \\"I Know It\\" are the two least memorable songs on this CD - straight ahead dance tunes without much of Madonna's panache.  With just 8 songs, \\"Madonna\\" breezes by quickly and sometimes seems a bit insubstantial.  However, the CD is an undeniable dance classic that began the Queen of Pop's career.  Most highly recommended.
0671027387|5.0|Want to know what a really cool book is? Want to be decived in a book? This is the book you should get!. Its a really cool story..or i would say Cold one up north. Its about how NASA tries to stay in one piece and also keep the president in power. Lots of blunder and backstabbing. The person you never knew would do it is the clue to it all. Reading this book makes u feel like you're in it, every feeling seems so real, like you're there, even the atmophere is seems so real, the pain and emotions. That what i call a thriller, like a roller coaster!.
0446310786|5.0|I also was not required to read this book in school.  I wish that my teachers would have used this book... I had to read Moby Dick instead.  I don't care how ignorant this makes me sound but, Moby Dick is a DULL DULL uninteresting book for a teen ager to read. <br />I fell in love with the book and the movie as an adult.  I have recommended both to parents over the years. <br />What great kids Jem, Scout and Dill are... sweet, but never cloying. <br />And, Aticus is righteous without being preachy. <br />Harper Lee fulfilled her life'e purpose sharing this story with all of us.  God bless her! <br /> <br />
B00005V1B1|5.0|Normally when you think of Progressive Rock, you think of three bands. Yes, Genesis, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer. <br />I, for one, have never liked any of these three, so where am I to turn to satisfy my Prog tooth? The answer is Camel. <br />Every track on here is great. The music is complex, incorporating many changes in meter aand tempo, not overlwhelmingly so. I think far to many prog bands put too much focus on complexity and not enough on writing good songs. That's not a problem here. Camel is great at coming up with catchy little hooks to keep the listener interested. You know they're doing something right when you find yourself humming along to a riff in 7/4 time. <br />The instrumentation is also perfect. They balance guitars, synths and flute without any of them being overdone. I should add that the flute playing rivals that of Ian Anderson on King Crimson's debut. <br />Finally, on the remaster you get a full half hour of bonus material, all of which is great. Ok, so the extra version of Lady Fantasy is almost the same as on the album, but it's a good enough song that I don't care.
014100018X|5.0|I am looking at a Penquin Books edition which has a different cover than the one illustrated (and more connected to the story).  Having visited the French Village of Lansquenet in the author's later novel, \\"Blackberry Wine,\\" I decided to step back in time to her first novel, also set in Lansquenet.  The novel covers a relatively short time period, from Shrove Tuesday to Easter.  A stranger has arrived in town while a local parade is in progress on this last day before Lent (OK, so the heathens in the US call it Fat Tuesday).  She gives her name as Vianne Rocher and is accompanied by her daughter, Anouk, and her daughter's invisible rabbit Pantoufle, who some people can sometimes see.  Vianne decides to stay, at least for a while, and turns an abandoned bakery into a chocolat shop, La Celeste Praline.  She opens during lent, tempting people with gourmet selections, and has an unusual knack for knowing what individuals like as their favorites.  She also has some other special magic.<br /><br />Vianne immediately finds herself in contention with Francis Reynaud, cure of the parish.  They both have secrets in their pasts that they keep hidden.  She views Reynaud as the Black Man, and he views her as an evil influence on the village.  An assortment of local characters are introduced.  Some become allies of Vianne, and some align themselves with Reynaud.  And there are the \\"gypsies,\\" people who live on houseboats on the river and move about from town to town.<br /><br />Vianne has the ability to win over people's minds with chocolat, but there are evil influences at work.  The white hats win in the end, and the village is left a somewhat different place.  Vianne, who grew up with her mother as a wanderer from town to town and country to country, considers moving on to another town.<br /><br />This is a well written novel, alternating chapters between Vianne and the curate Reynaud.  The chocolat can, perhaps, be viewed as white magic opposing the dark side represented by Reynaud.d by Reynaud.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|Listen to me.  I listen to power metal, death metal, melodic death metal, black metal, thrash metal, progressive metal, you name it.  I always thought Avenged Sevenfold was a metalcore Atreyu-Bleeding Through type band.  Maybe they were.  I don't know, this is my first album by them.  And I see all these posers wearing Avenged Sevenfold shirts.  I decided to give this a try.  First of all, the guitarists have a lot of modern power metal riffs and maybe influences.  This is a huge plus because I've never seen a mainstream band do this.  Second, I can see why many people say this band is not metal.  They do lean towards the happy/punk side.  But power metal is meant to be somewhat happy-sounding anyways.  Their look is very gothic which leads me to believe that the switchover to singing metal was a great idea.  I am especially impressed by the fact that they have longer songs.  \\"Sidewinder\\" is a 7-minute masterpiece.  I recommend this album to people who don't know what power metal is but would like to at least hear the guitars for it.  The style is more leaning towards mainstream punk.  But its good to see a band that combines both instead of being talentless trash.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|This is a very good album. My favorite albums are Violator and Songs of Faith and Devotion (as known as SOFAD). And \\"Playing the Angel\\" album is not close to 2 mentioned above. But anyway, PTA is a solid statement. It sounds much better than Exciter and a bit better than Ultra. Depeche Mode is back indeed. Still experimenting with sound, but still using old recipies of synth-pop and rock.  <br />   Some people like retro feel of songs like Precious, Suffer Well or Lillian. Some don't. In any case, all these retro sounding soungs are solid and original. I wish band spent a bit more time together and did this album as much conceptual as  Violator and SOFAD. But it's impossible to turn time back. They grew up, they're different and they meet together rarely after SOFAD tour. By the way, I'm really sick of whining people who can't get over Alan's departure. We all know how Alan was important for the badn success, but 10 years of whining is too much. Please, enjoy the music they're producing now. :) <br />   My favorite tracks from the ablum:    A Pain That I'm Used To, John The Revelator, Suffer Well, The Sinner In Me, Precious, Macro, Nothing's Impossible, Lilian.
B0000DJZ8R|4.0|This was a very interesting movie. It starts out slow, with the Joad family losing their farm and heading west, and mostly follows the storyline of the original novel. However, unlike other movies (from books), it has its own spirit and excitement.<br /><br />The characters that are most intruiging are Ma and Tom Joad. Instead of being quirky humor characters, they say many interesting things that may make you reflect on your own life in that manner. However, the movie may become uninteresting, with many repetitive/unnessecary scenes in the middle.<br /><br />Compared to, say, Harry Potter this movie is brilliant. It follows the storyline more than any other movie I've seen and really has some amazing acting by Henry Fonda.<br /><br />Overall, the movie is a good buy. Go for it!
B000001FRY|5.0|I give this album 5 stars based on one of my main criterions for classic LP's: \\"Boy\\" changed the template for 100's of bands to follow. U2 came from nowhere with stinging guitar reverb anthems sung by a young man who belted every song as if his life depended on it. From the wide-eyed charge of \\"I Will Follow\\" and \\"The Electric Co\\" to the the experimental sound of \\"The Ocean\\" and \\"An Cat Dubh,\\" U2 plowed forward with all the earnestness of adolescent believers.<br /><br />\\"Boy\\" became a favorite of college radio types (like this particular college junior) the summer it came out for mostly that reason. The band's urgency and general nonadherence to the typical sounds of the day (think Foreigner or Toto) made them all the more exciting. Steve Lillywhite's new, original style of production cranked up the reverb and piled on the drums, making the band almost primal. By the time the final notes of \\"Shadows and Tall Trees\\" faded away in that summer, those of us who latched on to \\"Boy\\" early had the feeling that this band had something to offer.<br /><br />(Also, why has this album and the U2 catalog not been upgraded? U2 are easily one of the best and most influential bands on the planet, and their early albums deserve more than to have shoddy liner notes and a late 80's quality CD transfer.)
B000050FEN|5.0|If, like me, you're a big Kevin Spacey fan you'll love this one. A very twisted and thoroughly entertaining piece of film making. From Brad Pitts performance as the anxious, young, brash detective with an attitude, to Morgan Freemans laid back, wise old man acting, to Kevin Spaceys psychotic, demented turn as a deranged serial killer, this movie hits all the right spots! Great direction, great location scouting, excellent script and plot. This movie is top of the line! Definitely check it out.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Having seen all the previous Batman's I was hesitant to watch yet another Batman but, to my surprise I found myself quite taken with this movie's approach. Batman Begins, takes you behind the scene of Bruce wayne's animosity towards the criminal mind and therefore gives clarity on the way he becomes Batman. Bruce's journey to self discovery was quite believable  embarcking the taste of desperate while learning the patterns of criminals. What I really enjoyed about the movie was watching Bruce Wayne's metamorphis into Batman. The director took great care in showing the audience the difference between Bruce Wayne the man and Batman the Ideal. An unforseen twist takes place when Bruce is confronted by a man who becomes his teacher. Bruce learns the art of ninja as he confronts the demons of his past.<br /><br />Out of all the Batmans I have to say Christian Bale takes the prize! He is completely comfortable with the role of Batman and at home in his mansion at Wayne's mannor. Christian has a natural chemestry with his butler and loyal employee Morgan Freeman. Of Course Gary Oldman does a perfect job as Officer Gordan. All in all the cast was well organized and perfectly matched! I was pleasantly surprised with the outcome of this movie and recommend this to any super hero, comic fan who enjoys the history of his heros as much as the adventures.
B000A2UBN4|1.0|This DVD is basically the first disc from the two disc special edition DVD of this film. Pointless re-release. Buy the two disc special edition, and skip this one! The film is presented in it's original 2.35:1 widescreen presentation, with the option of THX Approved 5.1 Dolby Digital, or 5.1 DTS soundtracks.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|I love this CD! My favorite thing about Avril Lavgine's music is that she writes about real experiences and things that she goes through. Everyone can relate to her music in some way because there are many topics in her songs that everyone has to deal with like: relationships, sadness, anger, death, happiness and things like that. I think it makes a singer ten times better when they write all their own songs because it's more personal and you have a chance to really connect with them.
B000AU9UYM|1.0|The movie is amazing and worth the price. This is one of the best movies of 2005. Disc 1 is the movie, the 2005 MTV movie awards intro spoof and a trailer. Disc 2 is the Worst DVD I have ever seen in my life. The menu system is a series of comic panels that has only one feature per screen and you can't tell what you are looking at with out actually starting the feature, most of the time anyway. I can't watch the Disc, its garbage and torture trying to deal with. Don't (DO NOT) even think about getting this version. I am going to return my copy to get the Batman Begins (Widescreen Edition). I never get the one disc version but I will have that one now. Save your money (even if it's only $5 [if it was a fifty cents I would still tell you to say your money] it's not worth it.

B0006IUDXA|4.0|I was musing to my brother one day that it would be neat to have \\"Macguyver\\" on DVD.  Lo and behold he hunted this one down for my birthday.  Honestly, I figured it would be nothing more than a big slice of 80's nostalgia, and that I would barely make it through watching it. <br /> <br />Wrong. <br /> <br />This show holds up well.  Looking at so much of the cheesy crap that falls out of the corpse of 80's culture, it's hard to remember that some shows in that era took themselves seriously.  This is one of them.   <br /> <br />MacGuyver was obviously written by a big Indiana Jones fan, you can tell that almost immediately, and the pilot episode, (which is usually the worst) is one of the best.   <br /> <br />This truly is a loveable, charming character placed in believable, high-adventure tales.  This is America's James Bond....too bad he never got any movies, eh? <br /> <br />I can't speak for any additional volumes as of yet...but this one is definately a buy.
B00028HBKM|4.0|\\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is a searing film. To call it \\"unflinching\\" would be such a gross understatement as to be insulting. I had no idea of the level of disparity between critical reactions to the film. I knew of the controversy about its supposedly anti-Semitic content, but I thought for sure that even those who may have disagreed with its version of events or level of violence could at the very least stand in absolute awe of its artistry. \\"The Passion of the Christ\\" is an exquisitely constructed masterpiece. Everything, from it's chilling score to its haunting cinematography (which manages to imbue equal amounts of dread in a gloomy garden in the dead of night as into a city in broad daylight)all work in pursuit of a common goal: to tell the story of Christ's suffering in fittingly horrific detail. It is a` brutally gorgeous success. <br />Now, in the interest of full disclosure, I must say (with a measure of shame) that I am woefully religiously ignorant. I only know the basic plot points of the story and there were more than a few characters with whom I was totally unfamiliar. So, regretfully I must agree with those who criticize Gibson for not telling the whole story. \\"They\\" say it because they disagree with Gibson's whole-hearted focus on Jesus' unimaginably violent end without expounding upon the extraordinary life that was extinguished. I say it because I am confident that Gibson could tell that part of the story with an equal amount of grace. So here is my humble challenge to Mr. Gibson: do it! Answer your critics with a breath-taking prequel. With Gibson as our guide religion is riveting. <br />
0393317552|4.0|Weapons, viruses and metal equipment managed the leadership of the European-American concept -- up to the year of 2000. However while one still is rubbing his hands, that China was taken off since the 14th century (Arabia since 15th), the tide can oppose nevertheless soon. At present, the technology and trade development of the Asian countries is enormously positive and the oil-possessing dominance of the Arabian states just increases her demand to a global (also ideological) con-design right. The threat factors \\"weapons, viruses and metal equipment,\\" -- represented always into actor pose nicely by president George W. Bush, impressed with fight bomber pilot jacket, with legs apart and broad grinning on the deck of an US-aircraft-carrier -- this success conception perhaps really could gradually oppose her inventors: State armies get for example increasingly powerless against the guerilla unit tactics of the present global suicidal terrorism. Jared Diamond perhaps looks a little confused for the stability guarantee of the European-American success concept. The geographical situation alone is not a guarantor. As an advantage factor it does not suffice eternally. Jared Diamond looks to make believe for us that the capability to make innovations, the courage to accept competition, the openness for intermixing (causes biologically seen virus resistance, hello, bird flu) -- that these factors will safeguard the further dominance of the European-American concept. He does not like to argue racialistly, religion critically or militaristically, although: The Indians of North- and South-America felt actually quite good without the missionaries and swords, railways and colts of the white ones; in addition, we do not see Diamond's remarks on drunken and lazy workers of non-white skin color (but some Afro-American reviewers do). [The factor \\"genocide\\" Jared Diamond does not examine, but in his follow-up book \\"Collapse\\" he analyzes how the Hutus murdered the Tutsis in Rwanda - avoiding the own nest soiling examples of how the American Indians lost their lives]. As an environmentalist, doubts come to the professor at the university of California , however, because of ruthless practices (so he worries in \\"Collapse\\" about some elks turned ill in Montana, toxins of a mine seeped into the ground there).

B0009QTS1M|3.0|I was disappointed by the sound quality. I knew something would be wrong the moment I saw that the theatrical and extended versions shared the same disc. On top of that, there is a French track (Il est l&agrave; pour quelle raison? Je ne sais pas), the commentary (good to have) and the trivia track (nice to have). Disc 1 suffered from having all that material crammed into it. The audio quality is worse than the Dolby track of the original Signature DVD. But if you've heard the DTS track on the original you just could not sit through this one. Once you go DTS you can't go back! Why didn't the producers of the extended edition simply put each version of Gladiator on a separate DVD? A 3-disc box could easily have been a 4-disc box without much extra expense. They could have done away with the French track to increase the bit rate. Heck, they could've done away with the theatrical version altogether! Near the end of the trivia track they suggest that the fans keep both DVD editions together as one 5-disc super edition. Then what is the point of having two theatrical versions in that collection? Although I'm disappointed I still have to say that the documentaries on disc 2 are very good. I have a suggestion: I think anyone who buys this edition is entitled to a free empty box and sleeves to put the 5 discs of both editions in it. They can call it \\"Gladiator: Consolation Edition\\". Now, about that 10th anniversary high definition edition...

B0002XVQNU|3.0|So I'm being harsh.  This movie IS entertaining.  But it's certainly no prize.  If you must watch or own a version, the director's cut is definately the one to get, because it is indeed a vast improvement from the original. <br /> <br />Understand though, the director, a practical no-name, was bullied by the studio during the entire filming.  It was HIS mistake for picking Ben Affleck, yes, but in his favor he DID try to get a more comic book accurate costume, to which the studio said, \\"too much like Spider-man\\". <br /> <br />Instead, they gave him a pleather track suit with a dog collar and said, \\"now that's dynamite baby!\\" <br /> <br />Other than that, it's a fun movie, but the music alone could drive you mad. <br /> <br />
B000B2YQX4|5.0|There is always something alien yet astoundingly constant and familiar about Depeche Mode. And there's no denying the countless new bands that have been influenced by the band. From Ladytron riffing off their styish monochrome aestheticism to electroclash bands like Fischerspooner borrowing their synthesizer template, there is no denying the pop-cultural impact that Martin Gore and gang have had. <br /> <br />Twenty-five years down the road and ten studio albums later, Depeche Mode are back with aptly titled Playing The Angel. This album is basically a consolidation of their usual themes of faith and devotion, self-flagellation and baptism by fire. Belying this is their usual unerring sense of melody, which have undeniably been one of Depeche Mode's trademark qualities over the years. <br /> <br />The Angel begins off in the right note with \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" which has a very familiar \\"I Feel You\\" / \\"The Dead Of Night\\" sound to it. Some other stand-out tracks in here are \\"John The Revelator\\", \\"Precious\\" and \\"I Want It All\\" - but don't get me wrong, every single piece on this album is better than seven out of ten. <br /> <br />That said, this album is one of Depeche Mode's stronger lyrically, as opposed to melodically. Every track penned by Gore is a lyrical masterpiece, while Gahan's songwriting, though less impressive, is not too shabby either. \\"The Sinner In Me\\" will leave one wondering what Gore's lyrics mean for vocalist Gahan: \\"I'm still recovering / Still getting over the suffering / More known for my anger\\". After all, the bands tribulations were legendary: Wilder's departure from the band was immediately followed by news of Gahan's attempted suicide at his home in L.A, after which he underwent drug rehabilitation for heroin addiction. In \\"Damaged People\\", when a double-tracked Gahan sings \\"When you're by my side / There is no defence / I forget to sense I'm dying\\", it sounds both sad and terribly liberating. <br /> <br />This album is not what it seems and strangely, through all the haunting songs, somehow comforts. It is psychotherapy for the oppressed souls among us; insidiously catchy dance music for everybody who has a heartbeat. <br /> <br />For a band that calls itself Fast Fashion, there is nothing fast nor fashionable about them. Depeche Mode aren't a fashion fad that go in and out with the season. Depeche Mode are here to stay - and with The Angel, they certainly prove their intentions very clearly once more.
B0006GAI6Y|3.0|***1/2<br /><br />The Japanese film, \\"Shall We Dance?\\" was one of the most commercially successful foreign language films ever released in the United States.  The almost inevitable American remake, now set in Chicago, follows the original very closely in terms of both storyline and spirit.<br /><br />John Clark (Richard Gere) is a successful middle-aged lawyer who has spent virtually his entire adult life devising wills for other people.  He has a happy marriage and two teenaged children who adore him, yet something still seems to be missing from his life.  One night, while riding the train home as he has done hundreds of times before, he finds himself transfixed by the image of a beautiful young woman staring out from an upper-story window of a second-rate dance studio.  Intrigued by the sight, John musters up the courage to get off the train, mosey on into the studio, and sign up for dance lessons.  As John begins to find meaning and purpose in his life, his concerned wife, Beverly (Susan Sarandon), fearing that he may in fact be having an affair, goes to a detective agency, headed by Richard Jenkins, to have the man she loves discreetly followed.<br /><br />Gooey moments and plot contrivances not withstanding, this is a sweet and charming film that, in its own quiet way, makes a profound statement about finding meaning in the second half of one's life.  Although the narrative and humor often have a sitcom feel to them, the overall breezy tone and good-natured ambiance of the movie win us over anyway.  And although many of the subsidiary people who populate this tale are really more caricatures than characters, at least they're colorful and well-delineated enough to add to - rather than subtract from - the central drama.<br /><br />Gere, Sarandon, Jenkins, Stanley Tucci, Bobby Cannavale and Lisa Ann Walter all give winning performances.  In fact, of all the actors, only Jennifer Lopez, as the beautiful young woman who teaches John a thing or two about dancing, falls short of the mark.  Ms. Lopez, for all her other undeniable talents, simply has not developed an actor's confidence on camera, and, as a result, she is unable to rise to the level of the professionals.<br /><br />On the other hand, the dancing alone makes the film worth watching.ing, falls short of the mark.

B000683VI4|5.0|by Brooke Millican. <br /> <br />The Notebook is about Tim Ivey as Rower and Gena Rowland as Allie Calhoun who fall in love over the summer, then break when they have a big fight. <br /> <br />I liked this movie because there is some drama. I also liked the actors who played the parts of Rower and Allie Calhoun. They did a great job in the romance part when Allie Calhoun came back to town to see her summer love. They ate dinner and lived forever together. I also liked when Allie's mother drove up to Rower's house and told Allie to come back home. After Mom left, Rower asked Allie if she had gotten any of his notes. She said no. He said \\"I wrote you three hundred and sixty-five days\\". That's why I liked The Notebook.
B00005UKE0|3.0|Sorry folks but, George wasn't up to much without Paul and John acting as producers for his songs - taking his raw songs with out a lot of character and giving them a unique sound. <br />Some of George's BEATLES songs were amazing, but the two greatest songwriters of the century deserved at least half the credit. <br />If this had been ONE LP with all the useless filler cut out, it might have rated 4 stars, but I would give it three because of all the wasted space. <br />Paul and John were geniuses. George was merely a competent musician with nothing special to say.
6304711921|5.0|by Harrison Merritt. <br /> <br />In Tim Burton's The Nightmare Before Christmas. Jack Skellington, The Pumpkin King of Halloween, yearns for nothing more than a <br />breath of fresh air, something new, instead of the same old, boring Halloween. As he wanders through the forest he visits a land of white with green trees and glowing lights, something he has never seen before, something wonderful. Jack Skellington will have Christmas this year, instead of the ubiquitous Halloween. <br /> <br />This story presents some of the most human complications composed of our most primal emotions of love, lust, and the unrelenting <br />urge for something new, which is what makes this story so engrossing. Not to mention the time consuming, but well-worth-it \\"stop-motion\\" animation. The settings and songs were groundbreaking. <br /> <br />The Nightmare Before Christmas has so much to offer, if you can get past the creepy overtones. I'd suggest it to anyone.
B000148KK2|3.0|My first exposure to Diana Krall was \\"Live From Paris\\" which I loved! This CD seems to focus more on Diana singing and not as much on her & the band's tremendous music.

B00003CXB4|5.0|by Amber Egan. <br /> <br />In the movie The Lion King there is a lot of action. In this movie Simba, the little cub, is learning to hunt. He is growing up. His Uncle Scar is a very bad lion. Simba runs away after the tragedy of his father's death. <br /> <br />You will really like this movie because I really liked it. The Lion King has drama, suspense, humor, and action. Personally, I liked the humor because the toucan sings a very funny song called \\"I've Got a Lovely Bunch of Coconuts.\\" I also liked the friendship between Timon, Pumba, and Simba. In the movie The Lion King there is a lot of action.
B0000AGWJ7|5.0|I first bought this album in California where a cousin of mine introduced me to the So-Cal metalcore/screamo scene. I'd previously heard of the artist from a friend back home, and I recognized the name on the jacket. I asked my cousin about them, and he gave me a brief synopsis of the band's origins and style. Due to my recent introduction to the genre, I was immediatley interested, so I bought the Waking the Fallen.  <br /> <br />Never before had a single album struck me the way this one did. The intro, Waking the Fallen, was, as expected, nothing too eventful, which made the initial transition to the guitar opening of Unholy Confessions that much more potent. This track, along with the rest of the album, has a pace distinctly slower than speedmetal, which really helps the riffs and lyrics stand out, by making that much easier to follow. The transition from Unholy Confessions to Chapter Four is seamless; the first time I heard it I assumed it was a continuation of the same song. Remenissions and Desecrate Through Reverence aren't tracks that stand out right away, but they're the kind of songs you grow to appreciate more and more as you listen to them, particularly the lyrics to Desecrate Through Reverence. Eternal Rest opens with a furious guitar rampage, but the song quickly slows down, returning to the deliberate pace that matches the rest of the album, broken uo, however, by a pair of almost disco-like interludes, making Eternal Rest an instant favorite. Second Heartbeat, my personal favorite track, flows with purpose for a solid six minutes with beautiful harmonies, finishing in a creschendo, climaxing in the seventh minute of the song with a 50-second guitar feast. From that high the album plummets back into the slower, determined pace with Radiant Eclipse. Not that that's a bad thing at all; Radiant Eclipse succedes in making a name for itself along, joined later by Clairvoyant Disease, as one of the more artistic, and poetic tracks on the album.  I Won't SeeYou Tonight Part I is the longest track, at a hefty nine minutes. Strangely, this is another of my personal favorites. Despite the length, this epic ballad signature A7X guitar and an eerie yet meoldic piano is probably the single most touching song. I Won't See You Tonight Part II takes a dramatic twist, resulting in an angry hymn that somehow manages not to fall into the stereotypical rage-metal category. Even when running right through the basics that define metal music in general, A7X prove they can still stand out. Clairvoyant Disease comes next, and as I mentioned before, stands out as another poetic, meaningful track. The album draws to a close with the climactic And All Things Will End which, after a slow start, bursts into an epic score, melding hope and despair together in an a five-minute tribute to the more classical metal sound, ending with another three minutes of pure guitar bliss.  <br /> <br />No album to date leaves me feeling more satisfied than Waking the Fallen. The songs average out to to about six minutes apiece on this album, which in the likeness of early Metallica, never cease to entice the listener. Even after months of listening, these are not songs you'll be skipping over on your playlist. These are the ones where you hang up the phone, mute the tv, and just close your eyes. Five stars cannot begin to explain the value of owning this music.
B00005JM02|5.0|by Brittany Herndon. <br /> <br />Finding Nemo is a comedy,action,and suspense movie that I think is a great kids movie. <br /> <br />I think that some funny parts in the movie are Nemo's first day of school. He is really excited! Another funny part is when Marlin, Nemo's dad, meets Dory, and they go and look for Nemo. <br /> <br />Some of my favorite action scenes are when Bruce, the shark, is chasing Marlin and Dory around, trying to eat them. Another scene is when Marlin and Dory go through the jellyfish so they can get to the jet stream to get to Nemo. Then there is the part where they meet the sea turtle and he helps them get to where Nemo is. <br /> <br />The parts that I think build you up with suspense is when Bruce, the shark, comes up to them and asks them to go to a party, because you don't know if he is going to kill them. Another thing is you that you wonder if Marlin will ever find Nemo. <br /> <br />I think that if you have small kids they would really enjoy this movie.

B00004TJTS|5.0|by Michelle Bullard. <br /> <br />My Dog Skip was a great movie. There was a whole bunch of humor, friendship, action, sadness, and romance in the movie. If I could I would buy it for everybody in the world just so they could see it. <br /> <br />An exciting part was when Willie (Frankie Muniz) gets a present that changes his life forever. Because of his gift Willie made a whole bunch of new friends. <br /> <br />A part of the movie that was really funny was when Willie got to train Skip. Another part is when Willie got to make a new friend named Rivers Applewhite (Caitlin W aches) because Skip kept playing in the store. <br /> <br />A sad part was when Skip got hit by a shovel and almost died. When Willie had to leave his home to go to college was also a sad part.

B0000VAFO0|5.0|by Brandi Pitts. <br /> <br />A war centuries old rages between the vampires and the lycans (better known as the werewolf). In an attempt to bring the war to a close, a vampire named Kraven and the lycan elder, Lucian, create a hybrid, a cross between the lycan and vampire species. <br /> <br />Underworld has a lot of suspense in it. When the main character, a vampire named Selena, realized her enemies, the werewolves, were after a human, she had no idea as to why. She had to go gather evidence to help her figure out what was going on. <br /> <br />Romance plays a pretty big role in Underworld. Love between the vampire and lycan species was forbidden by vampire laws. The vampires feared a blend of the species. So when Lucian, the werewolf, asked a vampire to marry him, his soon-to-be bride was killed. That's how the war began. Centuries later, Selena finds herself in the same situation when she falls for Michael, the hybrid. <br /> <br />The action scenes in Underworld are stunning. There are many life-or-death situations for the characters. The part with the most action and over all best graphics would be when the hybrid, Michael changes for the first time and fights the vampire, Viktor. <br /> <br />Underworld is a great movie and highly recommended for fans of werewolves and vampires. The creators of the movie did a great job bringing the fictional characters to life. They added a few of their own details but managed to stay true to the overall image of the creatures.

0790734850|5.0|Curtis Hanson's L.A.Confidential is a movie that will satisfy a broad set of criteria. It will stand the test of time unlike a lot of movies made of late including movies like \\"Million Dollar Baby\\". It is unfortunate that it came out the same year as the Titanic, frankly I do not see the fascination that the audience have for that movie. I for one did not see anything special about that movie. But I digress.     L.A.Confidential is one of the most creative movies made in the recent times based on the book of James Ellroy. It has an outstanding cast with each one at the right place. It has Russell Crowe at his best as the tough cop Bud White who will do anything against offenders of women. It has Guy Pearce as Lt. Ed Exley who finds the methods used in the L.A cops outdated and wishing to change it and becoming a political animal. He is slightly outcast but still does an impressive job. It has Keving Spacey in one of his special roles as the cool cop, Sgt. Jack Vincenness in Badge of honor. Between them they are trying to clean up the filth of the crime in LA.     Support cast in the form of Danny Devito and James Cromwell are ably played. This is well done especially in the form of the magazine created by the former, \\"Hush Hush\\". Kim Basinger is outstanding as the Veronica Lake lookalike. The movie has a lot of unusual humor that had me in stitches.     The one special place was when Pierce and Spacey go to the famous LA bar, Formosa, to bust Johnny Stomponato when he is with Lana Turner and Pierce thinks that she is not Lana Turner and and a lookalike. The interaction there is outstanding with Pierce getting a martini thrown on his face. Another special place is when Crowe and Pierce confront the DA and ask him for help and the way they force him. Though this was violent, it was so outrageous you have to laugh.     The movie can be very violent, but I like it for the plot, the comedy, the action, the direction, the acting, the screenplay, and the music by Jerry Goldsmith which was haunting and the way the movie ends. This movie is a must have. Though it won only two awards, I rate it higher than most movies that I have seen in the recent times. I am glad that I have this movie, I have seen it multiple times and I can always go back and see this movie for its various pieces. It is my prediction that this movie will stand the test of time. The transfer is very good and it is a must own for anyone interested in this line of movies.
1573223026|1.0|I only bought this book because it sounded like it could have interesting potential.  four characters from way different backgrounds, all ending up at the same crossroads.  too bad NONE of the characters were remotely likeable.  Most of them were annoying and bratty.  by the end of the book, I couldn't care less if they jumped or not.  There are some funny moments, no doubt, but few and far between. Hornby tries way too hard to inject little joke tangents into the anecdotes.  for example, check this out:  \\"But the ten minutes I spent talking to Bong made history. Well, not history like 55 BC or 1939.  Not historical history, unless one of us goes on to invent a time machine  or stops Britain from being invaded by Al Qaeda or something...\\" <br /> <br />HUH?  time machine?  Al Qaeda?  historical history?  those are the types of random and totally unclever tangents that the characters go off on in the middle of their stories.   <br /> <br />And the end of the book is not thought provoking, intriguing or at all redeeming.  mostly because you just don't care about the characters.  good story idea, bad book.  don't read it.
0385512104|5.0|This book is a rare treat. Christopher is a protagonist who elicits the reader's empathy, gives us a rare glimpse into the autistic mind, and his literal and straightforward dealings with other characters in the book had me in several fits of convulsive laughter! I highly recommend this book!
B000B2YQX4|1.0|Here's a revelation: Marty, you had better be begging for forgiveness from a higher power: The Consumers. Meaning all us pissed-off DM fans who refuse to take another DM record with 10 tracks of filler and dumbassed lyrics. The best penance is to give us a record with more than two good songs on it. And those lazy-arsed instrumental \\"interludes\\" don't count. Those instrumental \\"songs\\" are just filler that serves out to pad out the rest of the album filler. By the way, the lyrics for John the Revelator are the most side-splitting and stupidest I have EVER heard from any band, and are even funnier when read (which I will close my review with). <br /> <br />Aleksandr seems out of touch with reality, because nobody in the 21st century wants a tired and recycled-sounded album from their fave band. The masses do not want this crusty incarnation of DM. This new side of Depeche Mode is one I don't want to see a record from again. Shape up or ship out, Dave, Martin, and that useless Third Clog AKA Fletch the Fetch. DM's new \\"Precious\\" video saw the band being (literally) shipping out, so I suppose shaping up is out of the question. At least we'll always have Paris.... er, no, I mean Violator. <br /> <br />As promised, I will close with some of the most inane DM lyrics ever written (yes, they're as bad as \\"What's Your Name\\")... <br /> <br />John the Revelator/ Put him in an elevator  <br />Take him up to the top/ Where the mountains stop   <br /> <br />John the Revelator/ He's a smooth operator  <br />Take him by the hand/ And put him on a stand   <br /> <br />Seven lies, multiplied by seven, and multiplied by seven again  <br />Seven angels with seven trumpets/ Send them home on the gravy train
B000059XUO|5.0|This movie has made millions at the Box Office, and won over many viewers' hearts. You can actually feel all the emotion. Brandon Lee did great. His performance is memorable. Still today, he is the perfect Crow. No one can potray this role better. He will be remembered forever. And with the songs and the action? This film is a LEGEND. Even today, with all the fast-paced Action/Thrillers being made, nothing surpasses The Crow. Yes, not even the Matrix films. If anyday, you are tired of watching all the cheesy crap around tv, then shove the Crow dvd in your dvd player, sit back and enjoy the action. <br /> <br />This film was made to give Brandon Lee's last work a chance to breathe, and I'm VERY glad they completed it.  <br /> <br />Goodbye, Brandon. We all miss you.  <br /> <br />----------------------------------------------------------------- <br /> <br />\\"People Once Believed That When Someone Dies, A Crow Carries Their Soul To The Land Of The Dead.

6305949980|5.0|Tim Burton's worldview isn't quite like anyone else's, but that's what makes \\"Nightmare Before Christmas\\" such a treat.  Jack Skellington, the Pumpkin King, is tired of Halloween.  He kidnaps Santa, thinking he can do a better job and ends up creating the halloweeniest Christmas ever.  Some sensitive kids and adults may be disturbed by the imagery and the fun Burton pokes at the holiday.  Definitely for more mature children only.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|\\"Playing The Angel\\" is a very good album, in my opinion. Most of the tracks remind me of other Depeche Mode albums. \\"Precious\\" takes me back to \\"Violator\\" days. \\"John The Revelator\\" sounds like something from \\"Songs Of Faith And Devotion\\". When I listen to \\"Lilian\\", \\"Nothing's Impossible\\", or \\"Sinner In Me\\", I am thinking \\"Black Celebration\\". The sound is not nearly as \\"full\\" and digital as the \\"Ultra\\" album, but it still sounds great, very classic and very much Depeche-like. Vocals are good, synths and guitars find perfect harmonies together, overall a very good record, much better than the previous album, \\"Exciter\\". So why did I give this album 4 stars and not 5? Well, the two tracks that are sung by Martin Gore are, in my opinion, very weak. I cannot forget his masterpieces such as \\"One Caress\\", \\"Home\\", or even \\"Sweetest Perfection\\". These two are total throwaway tracks (just my opinion, of course). Other than that, great comeback for Depeche. Dark, moody, catchy. <br /> <br />Dice
B000B5XOY8|4.0|I think these films are all great in there own right. But with the release of the double disc special editions, Amazon stated that the (aspect ratio) was a wider screen format, than the original DVD's. That was the original reason for updating my collection.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I've enjoyed nearly all of Depeche Mode's earlier albums. While their music is consistently dark, they have changed quite a bit through the years. Even with their evolution, Depeche Mode has continuously succeeded at maintaining a signature form that can only be called their own.    SOME GREAT REWARD and BLACK CELEBRATION are much different albums than SPEAK & SPELL or A BROKEN FRAME. VIOLATOR is perhaps the best proof of how their music can stay industrial while sounding fresh. Depeche Mode is \\"fast fashion\\" indeed!    And to be honest, I have been very disappointed with their albums after VIOLATOR (post Alan Wilder) - even ULTRA; a fairly well-regarded album. Yet, this new release really impressed me! I loved this album right away... even on the first rotation. It took me many listens to realize what a great album VIOLATOR was.    Finally... to \\"The Man\\" who said this album sounds nothing like Depeche Mode, please go back and re-listen to the tracks \\"Suffer Well\\" or \\"Precious\\". Both \\"Suffer Well\\" and \\"The Sinner in Me\\" have a strong resemblance to MUSIC FOR THE MASSES. \\"Precious\\" sounds like an unreleased track from VIOLATOR. Even the two Martin Gore ballads are classic vibrato all the way! What you are SAYING!!?? And to say Pink Floyd's music is crappy?  With all due respect... you surely have no idea what you are talking about.    I highly recommended PLAYING THE ANGEL. It's an outstanding effort, and is a pleasant return to their classic form as opposed to the adapted 'NIN' style of their other recent albums. Even if PLAYING THE ANGEL doesn't hit you right away as it did for me, there's a good chance it will grow on you big time!
0385512104|2.0|I know a thing or two about autism and Asperger's syndrome - for the record they're quite different from each other - and had this book recommended to me on the grounds that it was just the sort of thing that would interest me. <br />Sadly, it didn't interest me. It was kind of interesting to begin with - having a mentally handicapped kid as the protagonist was an unusual twist - but I found the story generally annoying and rather monotonous. Thing is... just because a book is 'innovative' or 'artistic' doesn't mean it's entertaining. Perhaps some people - mostly those authors who would make literature as boring as academia if they had their way, and who quite frankly have their heads up their bums - will think me  shallow for saying this, but I say that a book should first and above all be enjoyable to read. This book wasn't very enjoyable. It was original and innovative, yeah, but it wasn't fun. Too much swearing and smut, and grubby stuff that I felt I was better off not reading. The story rambles along on no particular path, and I never particularly cared about any of the characters.  <br />Also, its portrayal of an autistic (this kid is clearly autistic, not an Aspie - there's virtually no similarity at all) is rather unconvincing and not as moving as the author perhaps wanted it to be. I think autistic people would be most accurately written about by other autistic people. Normal people like us should probably leave well alone.
0399230033|5.0|This is a wonderful book. I got it for my son's first birthday. We are now on our 4th copy. He is now 6 and still enjoys it. His 2 little sisters love it as well.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who has children or about to have them. It also makes a wonderful gift.
0060516402|4.0|Great book, excellent non conventional ideas to help everyone from the executive to the small business owner.  Discusses ways successful companies became that way, not by using the \\"kill instinct\\" to make profits at all costs, but by thinking about the products and services they provide and how they will enrich and improve their customers' lives.
B00004X01U|1.0|Back in 2000, I was still a huge Madonna fan. I kept wondering how she could of followed up the great \\"Ray Of Light\\" album and also she had recently had a hit movie soundtrack single titled \\"Beautiful Stranger\\". All of this was great, until I heard she was having a new album out. When I heard the first single, I was really disappointed. The track \\"Music\\" is more of euro pop and in my opinion is just awful. Majority of the album is like this. The 2nd single \\"Don't Tell Me\\", is the only decent track on this album. The 3rd single \\"What It Feels Like For A Girl\\" is just awful, in the words of Madonna \\"Degrating\\". I tried listening to other tracks such as \\"Amazing\\" and \\"Paradise\\", and so on. But there was nothing else on the album to offer to me. The Ray Of Light album had everything to offer on it. Now in 2005, she still has not yet made a record better than \\"Ray Of Light\\", Hopefully she will get back to her roots. Better luck next time Madonna!
B000AL730O|5.0|This is Paul's best album in 25 years.  It took me a while to get it but I finally get it.  His tunes on are right on and his playing is fabulous.  And his voice is as good as ever.  Who would ever think that a man who's 63 years old could sing like this?  Songs I love include Jenny Wren, A certain softness, and Too much rain.  These are Beatles-worthy songs.  English Tea is a kids song that really works -- my kid loved it right away.  A few of the songs take a while to get going, like How Kind of You, the 2nd song.  I couldn't listen to it when I first bought the album but now enjoy it.  I've loved this man for 40 year, through his not so great Wings years and Driving Rain (which I find to be dreadful), his very good albums like Flaming pie and Flowers in the dirt, and now this, his best work as a solo artist.
B000002NJS|5.0|MADONNA impressed me so much when she released this.This is an amazing album.Ray of Light did numbers for me.The first single Frozen was so awesome....I never get tired of hearing it.The second single Ray Of Light was awesome.The video for that song was awesome.The 3rd single was The Power Of Goodbye which is the best track on the album.The song has alot of meaning if you sit down and listen to the words.Then finally the last single was Nothing Really Matters which is a great song but charted a #93...Drowned World is an amazing song also...The hole album is amazing.I recommend this to you.
B00005JNJV|4.0|Not at all being one for the comic book fantasies that continue to flood the screens and gobble the dollars, camouflage weak scripts with tacky overblown computer graphics, introduce bizarre meanies and barely clothed wonder women, etc, I approached this BATMAN BEGINS with a big bag of prejudices.  And in no time at all that bag of unjustified prejudices began to fill with applause for a truly fine film that carries style, wit, character, and enough dazzle to please everyone.  This is a surprising good movie!<br /><br />It takes courage to move a larger than life fantasy hero into the realm of humans who through reasons of their own feel the need to become superheroes to the down and outers of the world. Watching the early life of Batman as produced and trained and stimulated by believable characters makes the non-believer want to return to the earlier forays into the genre.  So very much of the success of this film lies in the hands of a brilliant cast: Christian Bale (once again a hunk after his pathetically shriveled body in 'The Machinist'), Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Linus Roache, Morgan Freeman, Tom Wilkinson, Gary Oldman, Cillian Murphy and yes, even Katie Holmes (!) all master the tightrope of parody, serious drama, and comedy.  The costumes and cinematography are exciting and the direction by Christopher Nolan is pitch perfect.<br /><br />It is good to have a dusty old bag of prejudices fall apart.  Maybe there will be more action hero movies that take themselves seriously as an art form!  Grady Harp, October 05
B00008S2VG|1.0|I USED to be a big Madonna with albums like Like A Virgin,True Blue,Like A Prayer,and Ray Of Light....Did she fall on her head before making this crap...There are not hit singles here and no good songs at all..This album debuted at #1 I don't see how...But after only 1 week it dropped to #10 and so on...Do not get this Madonna album
0684833395|3.0|This truly is a satire that uses dry humor to bring home the book's points.  There were times when I was left shaking my head with a smile, or an outright laugh.  But for the most part I kept shaking my head wondering if all this book is about is dry humor satirizing the politics and ideology of WWII, or any war for that matter.  And yes, that is what the book was meant to do, but it doesn't make for a good novel, as everyone is saying.  A satirical conversation yes, a novel no.   <br /> <br />Reading the reviews the book is made out to have a flowing plotline that reveals the satire through an underlying conversation, one that uses a plotline of capitalist ventures, scheming officers and men who want out of the war.  But this just isn't the case.  The book itself is a loose collection of satirical comments that never form into anything other than a comedy, one meant to seem witty and fun.  But after 463 pages you are left with nothing more than an elaborate definition of Catch-22, one that has no storyline worthy of making this a novel. <br /> <br />If you are familiar with M*A*S*H and love it, then read this book.  If you love satirical comedies with no storyline, read this.  But if you are expecting to find a satirical \\"novel\\", as many reviewers have called this book, then you won't find it in this loose collection of witty phrases and hinted at revelations.  Heller does write wonderfully, and he is witty in his sarcastically dry sense of humor, so for that a three star. <br />
0767821629|4.0|Here are a few elements of this movie that might appeal to some people:<br /><br />Firstly, it presents a clearer, more sensible idea of how virtual reality works than its 1999 movie siblings \\"THE MATRIX\\" or \\"eXistenZ\\". And it does it thoughtfully, without mind-numbing action scenes and special-effects.<br /><br />Secondly, the virtual reality world of L.A. in the 1930s is visually rich, yet doesn't stray too far from a realistic look.<br /><br />Bonus extras are Armin Mueller-Stahl's, Vincent D'Onofrio's and Dennis Haysbert's performances, Gretchen Mol's lusciousness (also enjoyably down-to-earth as a grocery clerk), and exquisite direction and photography (Josef Rusnak, Wedigo von Schultzendorff)<br /><br />On the DVD, director Rusnak makes the accompanying commentary in the way I like -- he comments on what we're watching with relevent and interesting behind-the-scenes info.<br /><br />I rewatch this film (and film with commentary) frequently for these reasons.

6300271285|5.0|I really liked this movie because the villain was really scary. And I really like scary villains! I normally don't like movies with real people in them, but this movie is one of my favorites, even though it's not a cartoon. I really liked the part where Seymour saves Audrey from Audrey II. Another great part was when the plant was very small and it went \\"kissy\\", \\"kissy\\". I also really liked the ending, where Seymour electrocutes Audrey II. Then, Seymour and Audrey get married. Don't pass by this movie without buying it. You will really like it, and you won't be sorry you bought it!

B00004YX39|4.0|Recorded in 1979 and released in 1980, Gaucho was part of that period of transition between the groovy 70s and preppy/conservative early-80s that yielded some weird fads and fashions like PacMania, Solid Gold dancers, moon boots, terry-cloth shirts, leg warmers, and Rubiks Cube.<br /><br />Contemporaneous hits like \\"Pop Muzik\\" by M were disco-hybrids. Enter the last Steely Dan album, Gaucho, an interesting mix of lyrical pop and decadent disco. While having a strong resemblance to its predecessor, Aja, it amplified the slick, garish disco elements of the former Steely Dan album on the songs \\"Babylon Sisters\\" and \\"Glamour Profession\\".<br /><br />But their trademark studio professionalism was precisely honed with the addition of even more top-flight studio musicians like Larry Carlton, Joe Sample, Mark Knopfler, and David Sanborn. The hits \\"Hey Nineteen\\" and \\"Time Out Of Mind\\" were constantly played on the FM-light radio stations. The album cuts, \\"Gaucho\\", \\"My Rival\\" and \\"Third World Man\\", displayed that Fagen's lyrical songwriting ability was only getting better with time. Also, the album has great keyboard-playing by Fagen, Joe Sample, and others. Recording-wise, Gaucho has probably the best sound of any Steely Dan album (it received a 1981 Grammy award for best-engineered non-classical album), and is one of the classic pop albums from the early 80s.
B00002MZ4V|3.0|I SAY THIS IS A PRETTY GOOD COLLECTION OF JOHN WILLIAMS. IT STOPS AT 1999 AND SOME OF HIS RECENT STUFF IS EXCLUDED FROM THIS COLLECTION. I WAS GOING TO PURCHASE HIS ULTIMATE COLLECTION, BUT WAS DISAPPOINTED TO FIND SOME OF HIS BEST TRACKS SUCH AS \\"CADILLAC OF THE SKIES\\" MISSING. I WOULD SAY THIS IS STILL A PRETTY GOOD BYE.
0060763280|5.0|Great advice for a reasonable price!
B000002UAU|5.0|First I have to say that I love the Beatles but this is my least favorite Beatles album, I know, a lot of people think its their best, and thats great, but for me personally I do not enjoy it like I do the other Beatles albums, I just don't think the songs are there, I like \\"With a little help from my friends\\", \\"Getting Better\\", \\"Being for the benefit of Mr. Kite\\", \\"Sgt peppers\\" (both), and \\"Day in the life\\",  but the album as a whole doesn't match up.  This is just me though, I really do HIGHLY RECOMEND this album though, and heres 2 reasons why.    1. This is probably the most innovative record in rock history, these guys were doing things musicaly and recording techniques  that had never been done before, tricks that people still use to this day.  I've argued the importance of this album many times with people who don't respect it just because they don't like it.  It might not be my favorite in the Beatles catalog, But I respect the hell out of it.    2. \\"A DAY IN THE LIFE\\". without a doubt one of the greatest songs ever written.  John Lennons vocals are just amazing, the whole song is amazing, its definetly worth buying for that song alone.    Beatles were a great band, if you haven't heard this album, buy it, I think its a must have,  it might be my least favorite beatles album but its still a good album, and chances are you'll probably think its a great album.
B00005RHGL|5.0|I am 55 years old and have seen countless western movies every since I was a kid. Growing up in rural Texas I was obsessed with western movies, TV shows....anything to do with the old west. I always thought 'High Noon' was #1 and 'Shane' #2. But no more. 'Tombstone' is #1! The cast could not have been more perfect! The characters seemed real. Some fiction involved, but also a lot of true facts. 'Wyatt Earp' with Kevin Costner was terrible on it's own, and even worse if it's compared to 'Tombstone'. And as someone pointed out, Val Kilmer did indeed dominate any scene he was in. It is not only the best western movie, but one of the best movies I've every seen period.
B000002UA9|5.0|A lot of people are one sided with the beatles, they either like their early stuff or they like their later stuff,  I like both,  though I think a lot of their best work came from their later matieral,  I like the early stuff more, it's more consistant,  I can enjoy the entire albums (though the whole \\"love\\" thing wears thin after a while). <br /> <br />\\"Please Please Me\\" is right up there with \\"Hard Days Night\\" and \\"Rubber Soul\\" as the best beatles albums in my opinion, This album is like a throwback everytime I listen to it, theres something about the sound that makes me feel like I'm back in '63 for some reason,  its raw, not too polished, I like that, <br />and the songs are really good, I think early beatles music gets overlooked,  sure they are simple catchy pop songs,  but they are GOOD,  and it just shows how talented they were.   <br /> <br />This album has 9 Beatles originals and 5 covers. <br /> <br />1. \\"I saw her standing there\\"- everyone should know this song, this is a good rockin song,  great way to kick off the album. 10/10 <br /> <br />2. \\"Misery\\"- One of the best on the album, good melodies, good raw sound 10/10 <br /> <br />3. \\"Anna\\"- I love this song too, good laid back song with a nice 50's feel too it. 10/10 <br /> <br />4. \\"Chains\\"- this is a cover from the Cookies if my memory serves me right, I'm not too fond of this song, don't really care for the original either, its not a bad song it just doesn't grab me, it's pretty mediocre, I usually skip it. 5/10 <br /> <br />5. \\"Boys\\"- is another cover, a little better than chains but still not one of my favorites, Ringo sings this one, its got a similar feel to it as \\"Money\\", or \\"I'm down\\".  decent song 7/10 <br /> <br />6. \\"Ask me Why\\"- many people don't care for this song, I like it, I love the sound its got.  is it one of the beatles best? no, but its still a great song. 9.5/10 <br /> <br />7. \\"Please Please Me\\"- Great song, Beatles classic, really catchy.  10/10 <br /> <br />8. \\"Love me Do\\"- good song, a little over-played, probably the simplest Beatles song, but it works.  9/10 <br /> <br />9. \\"P.S. I love you\\"- like \\"Ask me Why\\", I love this song it kinda has an Elvis feel to it.  10/10 <br /> <br />10. \\"Baby it's you\\"- One of my favorites, originally done by the Shirelles, I love the original, and I think the Beatles do it better.  Great song.  10/10 <br /> <br />11. \\"Do you want to know a secret\\"- One of the Beatles best, George sings this one, and does a great job.  The music is great, the backing vocals are great.  awesome song.  10/10 <br /> <br />12. \\"A taste of Honey\\"- This song gets bad reviews, but its one of my favorites of the album, its a cover,  and its probably the biggest throwback on the album, it sounds different than anything on the album.  The vocal melodies are perfect, with just the right amount of reverb, great recording, it just sounds really good.  Though I could see why others wouldn't like it, because it does sound different and out of place, but it suits me just fine.  10/10 <br /> <br />13. \\"Theres a Place\\"- Another personal favorite, that middle part, the \\"Like I love only you.....In my mind theres no sorrow...\\" part, that part right there just makes this song. Just how they throw that in there and they only do it once, no matter how simple it is, its genius, in my opinion. Also the Harmonica (I think thats what that is) sounds great.   10/10 <br /> <br />14. \\"Twist and Shout\\"- ......come on, everyone knows this, this song may be over-played, but its still great,  and even though its a cover, The Beatles own this song if you ask me. 9/10
B0001US8EO|2.0|Not realistic.....Wyatt Earp dunking Doc's head in the water? Don't think so! And a lot of it boring. Wyatt Earp was no saint I'm sure, but his character was so obnoxious at times I was almost rooting for his enemies! Enough said. Bad western...bad movie.
B00008MNYS|5.0|I cant beleive that Robbie hasnt caught on in America more than he has. He is an enormous talent!! This albumn goes in my top 10 of all time!! Its one of the few that my husband and I can listen to start to finish and love every single song!! Robbie is the best in my book!! BUY THIS ALBUMN and you will have NO REGRETS!!!
B00005NI5Y|5.0|I'm a big fan of Dylan as a performer, songwriter and musician. The production on this record is the best he's ever had (by conincidence, he twisted the knobs on this one). You have to lean in to listen to what's going on. The narratives go from external, describing something to the internal. One of the things Dylan has always done best is crib lines from old blues and hillbilly and British Isles tunes and illuminate them in a different context. The themes of this CD are regret, forgiveness all filtered through Dylan's interpretations of various native Southern musics without being hokey, obvious or lame.
B0000648WZ|1.0|While this movie is supposedly based on the Heinlein book of the same name the only resemblance it bears is the names. The entire basis for \\"Mobile Infantry\\" in the book is the space armor that the troopers wear and the movie eliminates that armor.<br /><br />One doesn't expect the armor to be explained in detail as in the book but one does expect it to be worn since it WAS the basis for the book.<br /><br />The movie does not even deserve the one star that I was forced to give it.
B000B7HZXM|3.0|Rod knows he's hit on the right vein of music that has become so popular again so that's why this no.4 in the series is here.  <br /> <br />Unlike the very popular and handsome Michael Buble who lives and breathes this style of music, you can hear Rod struggle a little to sound genuine. Close, oh so close to sounding good.....
B000B8I8X2|5.0|OK i download the dagger (the oen they (roadrunnr) released online and once I heard that I knew it was going to be a gem, then i heard the other they released and still was blown away. So i preordered the cd like mad. I finally got the cd and was blown away but yet not at the same time. while most of the track are metal,death metal etc or so fourth they throw in punk which honestly in my opinion threw everything off. Its not a bad thing but punk is simply not my thing... thou I don't wanna be a superhero was created by the awsome drummer called Joey Jorison. with him writing an amazing 5 songs himself for the albm his weakest in my opinion was the i wanna be a superhero song.but it was an innovative song from what what he normally does and is well done. <br />but from when you first put the cd in you get a blast right off of the bat with metal from \\"The Dagger' staring the former lead singer of Killswitch Engage. then once your done with the brutal trashing of that song your thrown in to the Enemy which is yet another great song. over and over your thrown into greaT awsoem songs that recks of heavy metal. with the xception of the two or three punk tracks. I would recommand this album for anyone to get it a classic to me that I always enjoy listening to.
B00000I07P|5.0|Bon Jovi was a big hit in the 1980's and, like most of the other great \\"big hair\\" bands of that era, it was thought that his name would forever be associated with that time - that his \\"star status\\" would end by the early 1990's.<br /><br />However, with this CD, Bon Jovi has shown his ability to alter both his music & style to fit a whole new generation (yet without moving away from his roots) - and he continues to rock us with his music even now - some 20 years after he began - Something that very few rock musicians have achieved...<br /><br />Overall, I would highly recommend this CD to anyone who ever liked the music of Bon Jovi, as well as those who just like rock music.  Bon Jovi is an awesome artist who I believe has now achieved \\"legendary\\" status.
0060763280|5.0|Excellent book, amazing workshop! <br />Go for it! <br />You deserve to be happy AND rich! <br />
B0000DIXDR|5.0|\\"Dirty Dancing\\" is an awesome romance movie set in the late 1950's.  Everything takes place at an upper-class, family-friendly summer camp - where \\"rich\\" families come to be entertained for a few months.<br /><br />One of the first things I noticed was the great dichotomy between the \\"workers\\" & the \\"guests\\", as well as between the \\"dancers\\" and the rest of the staff.  The dancers are considered \\"low lifes\\", and as \\"less than\\" everyone else - as they generally come from poorer homes.  The rest of the staff tends to be kids who plan to go on to well-known colleges & universities - and because of this, many of the families want their girls to become interested in (and hopefully at some point marry) the boys who are ANYTHING but dancers.<br /><br />The premise of the movie is that one of these \\"rich girls\\" (Baby, played by Jennifer Grey) falls in love with the \\"head\\" dancer (Johnny, played by Patrick Swayze), and an amazing love affair ensues.  During this \\"love affair\\", several things happen that make the girls' father think even worse of the man Baby's come to love, and so she's forbidden to see or talk to him again.<br /><br />Several important life-themes come up in this movie, including: the concept of social class & how this can make us blind to truth, the realization that what you see is not always what you get (you can't judge a book by its cover), the fact that we can all do whatever we put our minds to, and that the only constant in life is that things will change.<br /><br />Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone who enjoys a good romance - it's one that can pull you in easily, and keep you hooked all the way to the end!
B000A88EVE|5.0|Way back, when this came out, I was the only one I knew who liked it. I still like it, and I'm still not completely sure I know why.<br /><br />It's about mood, without being a moody film itself. It's a study in loneliness, the feeling of isolation that can only come from other people - never from mere solitude. In the 1970s, the inter-racial couple and the same-sex couple were novel, maybe a bit hard to take, but effective. They said a lot about the many ways to be together. Tommy (David Bowie) and MaryLou said a lot about the ways to be apart, no matter how close. I've known women like MaryLou, unsophisticated and uncomplicated, but devoted. That created a tilted asymmetry between them, with components that are nothing to be proud of. Still, their affection was real. It's almost painful to see an alcoholic buffer rising up between them, blocking both the pain and the pleasure.<br /><br />It's stylish and nonlinear, and has the humorous moment where Bowie seems to work at singing badly (the only time he does sing in this movie). It somehow documents emotion without itself bein emotional. And it's still strange.<br /><br />//wiredweird
0802136834|5.0|I bought this book to do my mid term for my History class. The author gives views of how the wives of King Henry VIII lived in those time. This is better than a soap Opera!
B000B9EY2U|5.0|I'm always excited when Depeche Mode has a new album.  This was no let down - in fact, this somehow managed to exceed my expectations.  This album seems to me to be Black Celebration, if it evolved.  It has all the old time synth based music, but also has a bit of each of the other album's charm in it as well. <br /> <br />If you are one of those \\"I miss Alan Wilder\\" fans, you will be pleased with this album.  If you are a die hard fan, well, you'd be pleased with this album regardless of what it sounded like.  :)   <br /> <br />PS this is a great album for the beginner Depeche Mode fan.
B00005R1N3|4.0|This is a nasty little piece of work. If you are looking to pay money in exchange for a sleepless night, you couldn't do much better than \\"Black Christmas\\", a film which hasn't lost its ability to scare the crap out of you thirty years after it was shot.<br /><br />This film, from the 'less is more' school of horror movies, serves notice in the first 30 seconds that it means you and its characters a lot of harm. It begins with a decorous shot of a big, festively lit and suspiciously isolated sorority house; immediately it switches to the POV shot of a mouth-breathing and univited guest, who promptly climbs a latticework up into the attic and makes himself comfortable there....unbenknownst to the residents. We don't know who the intruder is, but it sure as hell ain't Santa Claus.<br /><br />Inside the party the film wastes no time establishing its female leads: hard-drinking, abraisive city-girl Barb (Margot Kidder, delightful as a queen bitch), \\"professional virgin\\" Claire, nerdily charming Phyl, coldly self-absorbed Olivia Hussey, and closet drunk house mother Mrs. Mack. It makes no effort to establish who the \\"main character\\" is, and by doing so leaves you with the distinct (and correct) impression that no one is safe.<br /><br />In addition to the gals, there are three boyfriends, a fat guy with a ridiculous 70s-era afro, thrown in for comic relief; a cool hockey player named Chris (complete with goalie mask)who wears a Joe Namath fur pimp coat, and a high-strung aspiring concert pianist, Peter, who fulfills the the \\"is he or isn't he the killer\\" role very nicely.<br /><br />What follows could be called your standard \\"ten little Indians\\" scenario, as the sorority girls, who are in the process of packing up for Christmas break, are stalked and eliminated by the gibbering lunatic hiding in the attic. As is often the case in horror movies, the ladies don't know there's a killer amongst them until it's way past too late, busy as they are with their personal problems, petty rivalries, and a series of increasingly bothersome obscene phone calls. And even when they finally get the word, both they and the police (represented by the fine John Saxon) can't quite seem to grasp that the important thing is not so much who the killer is, but where he is....<br /><br />\\"Black Christmas\\" achieves its terror the old fashioned way: by providing us with well-drawn, well-acted characters that we care about, rather than the usual acting-skool dropout slasher fodder; by clever and skillfull camerawork that takes us deep into a truly disturbing mind; by clever misdirection and a lot of unanswered questions; and by skimping on the gore in favor of letting the audience's imaginations run bloody riot. In addition, the obscene phone calls, which consist of a combination of gibberish, giggling, screaming, squealing, breathing, and X-rated profanity, are so disturbing that as the film wears on, every ring of the telephone has the viewer feeling more and more like upchucking the spicy Chinese food he was stupid enough to eat while watching. And I won't even get into the horrible \\"plastic wrap\\" posing the corpse thing in the attic. That is truly the stuff nightmares are made of.<br /><br />Like all horror films it has some flaws, most notably in the logic department, and the \\"unanswered questions\\" approach, while very effective, is also occasionally annoying. One might accuse the screenwriter of using this approach so as to be able to cheerfully ignore closing some gaping plot holes. There is also a grotesque piece of foreshadowing when Mrs. Mack complains that a certain crucial door has a tendency to stick. Gee, wonder if it will stick later, when a certain sorority girl REALLY needs it to open? But overall these are minor bones to pick. It's a good script, and was very well-executed.<br /><br />If you are a fan of intelligent horror flicks that rely on brain rather than blood 'n brawn, \\"Black Christmas\\" is for you. Just don't expect to get a lot of sleep afterwards.<br /><br />----end of review/beginning of SPOILERS!!! or rather some things people who haven't seen the movie shouldn't read--------<br /><br />Some questions & surmises I have after watching the flick:<br /><br />1) Who killed the girl in the park? Was this the work of the killer before he went into the house, or is this the work of somebody else, perhaps Peter? Or is it just misdirection?<br /><br />2) Who killed the cop outside the house? It seems unlikely the killer could climb out of the attic, sneak up on the cop, open the door, slit his throat, and get back in the house unnoticed. He sure as hell didn't go out the front door. Did the \\"other\\" killer get him? Was it Peter?<br /><br />3) Who the F are Agnes and Billy? My guess would be that they once had a child together, possibly in that very same house, but either she had an abortion (and so he killed her and went insane afterwards) or they killed the child together (\\"Pssst, Agnes, it's me....Billy. Don't tell them what we did!\\") and this drove Billy bonkers.<br /><br />Questions to ponder as I watch the film again and forfeit yet another good night's sleep.ERS!!! or rather some things people who haven't seen the movie shouldn't read--------    Some questions & surmises I have after watching the flick:    1) Who killed the girl in the park?

B000AJJNPY|5.0|Takk. Translate to thanks in icelandic.(well thats what ive been told) <br />And i am certainly thanking sigur ros for this lovely record. <br />This album requires ones undivided attention to really appriciate its soft melodies embraced with some very unique sounds. This album   really needs to be heard from start to finish to really appreciate, like all good records.
B00004XONN|5.0|I want so badly to convince music lovers out there to listen to this record, no matter what their tastes. It is such a stratospheric leap from their previous records which were fantastic in their own right. To call it electronica is like calling John Coltrane saxophone music (no comparison intended). Unlike other experimental efforts from bands forging into new areas, this record didnt require me to develop a taste for it; to flesh out the parts I could get into. The whole album from start to finish grabbed me because in my opinion, it is BRILLIANT.
B0000AUHQT|3.0|I'm not going to recover all the same ground as previous reader reviews, thus adding to the Department of Redundancy Department flavor of this section. What I WOULD like to say is that the version of the film available to the purchasing public is horribly hampered by its \\"replacement\\" soundtrack. If you wish to see why this film was considered great at the time of this release, catch it on TV sometime with its original, scene-and-era-appropriate soundtrack, not the mewling, repetitive crap it was replaced with. I sincerely wish that whatever legal beefs led to its excision from the retail version of the film could be resolved. In the meantime, it's a great example of how a great soundtrack makes a great movie.
0767836324|4.0|I always wanted to know, why did the critics see this film to be so terrible? I thought it was spectacular. I am a huge fan of Peter Pan and all the adaptations, and besides P.J. Hogans, I thought this captured the magic. This is when Speilberg's films were full of adventure and excitement, something I wish we could see today. Dustin Hoffman's protrayel of Captain Hook is hilarious. Not only amazing, but at times I can't believe that is Dustin Hoffman underneath the coat, wig, and hat. Robin Williams as an adult Peter Pan, was a perfect pick. The entire cast was unchangeable. I thought Spielberg brought life to the entire picture. It is a family movie, and a great family movie. I remember watching this at times with family members everytime it was on. Peter was my first childhood hero, and Hook was my first childhood villain, and I thank Spielberg for it...for making this picture.....
B0000026UV|5.0|Great CD, Chet and Mark sound like they had a great time doing this project and gave us a wonderful recording to enjoy.
B00097A5HW|4.0|The album is totally great. From the beginning En Tus Pupilas has given you slow rhyme and good lyrics. La Pared, the second, is really a bossa-nova song, really great and powerful. The first single La Tortura is a really catchy Latino dance-beat song. So groovy, yet energetic. The second single No, has a really good rhyme, and word intention by Shakira. The remixes (Shaketon Remix and Version Acoustica) on the end of the album is so great, like the different version of the original songs. The rest of the album is not really special, there aren't any strong intention. But along this album, all you can do just \\"gasp\\". Listening to how Shakira plays her voice, songs, rhymes, words, and intention will make you feel so lucky to buy this album than watch her body on La Tortura video. It's really extraordinary. I think this record is more serious and powerful for me than any of her album before. <br />You should try and buy this album. It's a big-guilty-pleasure for Latino-fans in 2005!
B000068QY7|3.0|I think this album is an underated stunner for them. I love the song stop crying your heart out. I think it's there best song.
B00008D1NF|1.0|This CD seems to illustrate the worst out of creativity by committee.  There are no great tunes here, I hate to rain on the parade of praises this CD is getting, but here we have 3 great artists (actually I only know Monte and Brown), who I love and combining them results in mush.  Bland, unimaginative, boring music. Incredible.
B000089CJI|4.0|I could not believe how good this album was every song rules. Fans of the 80's synth bands like depeche mode erasure and omd,will love this album. Has the old new wave sound mixed with modern music. This album is highly contagious.

B0000669JL|5.0|Legend contains 14 of his greatest songs, running the gamut from \\"I Shot the Sheriff\\" to the meditative \\"Redemption Song\\" and the irrepressible \\"Three Little Birds.\\" Some may argue that the compilation shortchanges his groundbreaking early ska work or his status as a political commentator, but this isn't meant to be definitive, it's meant to be an introduction, sampling the very best of his work. And it does that remarkably well, offering all of his genre-defying greats and an illustration of his excellence, warmth, and humanity.
0307276902|5.0|Excellent book. I enjoyed it so much - despite the fact that it's filled with horrors & pain. I'm still crying from reading the end a minute ago.
B00005JMFQ|1.0|Note: 0 stars was not an option.<br /><br />This movie could not have sucked more, well it could have, but then it would have been Gigli. I so hated this movie that I tried to get my money back and even argued for a refund on my box of goobers. No one likes a British comedy more than me. The Full Monty, Billy Elliott,About a boy, even Calendar Girls would be better than this drivel. It was a who's who of today's best British actors but even they seemed embarrassed to be there and only showed up in body. They left their talent at home. I'm not pointing fingers but someone called in some favors..the writer?..the director? Who knows. Not enough to discourage you? OK, here's some more...<br /><br />Under-developed characters with as much personality as a box of hair. Completely, unbelievable plot lines. Too many plot lines to follow without a pen and notebook. Hugh Grant as the Prime Minister of England..come on. Oh, and Americans come off very badly in this film. Our President is a big, bully chewing on hayseed while grabbing innocent English women on their bottoms. All the while bullying England into doing his bidding. A nose-picking, burping, illiterate jerk of an Englishman goes to America because there he can get dates. American women(giggling half-wits) will do anything(including him) once they hear that English accent. What else, too PC, too boring, too long, too stupid, just too much. Trust me, you'll thank me later. Buy something off the list I gave at the beginning of this review instead. You will be happy you did.

B000053VAZ|5.0|Although this is one of the early movies when Johnny Depp was just starting out, The acting was as usual fantastic and the movie was great. It was funny but also had an excellent story behind it. I already had the movie on vhs but purchased it on DVD so I could watch it more often. I'm not sorry at all and enjoy watching it each time.
B000AMWIVM|5.0|When it comes to horror movies, most of todays fare are mediocre at best.  They seem to center around a young adult ebing tormented by some unseen assailant in a goofy halloween mask.  And by the end of the flick you wonder why you invested that much of your life watching it.  Bad effects, lousy soundtracks and terrible acting seem to be the foundation to the majority of the lot lately. <br /> <br />And then there is 'Saw'... <br /> <br />The setting is excellent.  The old bathroom that comprises most of the movie's background is straight outta my nightmares.  It has excellent acting, and the soundtrack is perfect for the style and tone of the whole movie.  The best part being the ending(no spoilers here if you haven't seen it yet)...it catches ya by surprise to the point ya have to rewind it 5 times just to see how you missed it to begin with. <br /> <br />I didn't want to go into detail too much for those who have not taken in this masterpiece of modern horror. <br /> <br />I am eagerly awaiting to see if 'Saw II' lives up to it's predecessor.  The voices in my blood say 'Yes'...
B000AA302U|5.0|This is a return to form for Jamiroquai. Whereas previous outings had several tracks, that I would skip in my iPod, this one has (almost) none. Most tracks are uptempo, very energetic and contagious. The production is outstanding, as are the arrangements. You won't be disappointed.
B0009YA37W|5.0|To Roman Hans, Brooklyn, NY.....Let's get this straight...Interpol are themselves a cheap rip-off of Echo & the Bunnymen and Joy Division, but who cares!!!!!!!  Editors write good songs with catchy melodies that you can sing along to!  Everybody knows the best bands are British anyway, and I'm American.  Echo, Joy Division...both British...Perhaps you are a bit biased because Interpol are from NY also?  Why don't people just review the songs themselves instead of worrying who sounds like who or who is stealing somebody else's sound?  This album is absolutely the album of the Year...well, tied with British Sea Power's \\"Open Season\\" that is.  Trust me people, buy this album....it's a keeper.
B0000DD7LB|4.0|The pop/dance album was very good.  I believe the best in her career to me.  All her other crap has been too poppi and bubble gum and now she shows she has some maturity (lol i know Britney mature).  But I loved \\"Me Against the Music\\", \\"Toxic\\", \\"Outrageous\\", \\"Touch of My Hand\\" and \\"Everytime\\".  I can stomach 50-60 mins of Britney so I'll survive.
B0001UL7RY|3.0|If you've heard all the singles and are tired of them; this CD offers no pleasant surprises. There's one catchy, pop tune here that has not been released as a single. <br /> <br />1. It starts with this up-beat, non-cathy, rather borin song about her being unable to move on. People will like it because of the typical Avril chorus sound. 2/5 <br /> <br />2. Didn't I just hear this song? 2/5 <br /> <br />3. Not about to let him get in her pants. I really like this song, but it might have grown a lot because of radio. Upbeat aand with plenty of attitude. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. Another attitude song about getting someone you don't want. Upbeat and catchy. 4/5 <br /> <br />5. A slow one. About being weak and wondering what it would be like not to be so weak. Not so catchy. 1/5 <br /> <br />6. My favourite song. When a relationship goes wrong and you want to get back together. It's one you can relate to. Very catchy and upbeat. 5/5 <br /> <br />7. About not having anyone and being in trouble. This one is also very catchy. And defnitively a grower. Mid-tempo/up-tempo. 5/5 <br /> <br />8. This one is creapy. It's about another relationship gone down the drains. The chorus sound like midnight mass. 4/5 <br /> <br />9. When two persons find eachother and are exploring. Album filler, but it's got that Avril beat to it so you might listen to it anyway. 2/5 <br /> <br />10. Declaration of love. Nice chorus, but the song is boring. 2/5 <br /> <br />11. Album filler. 1/5 <br /> <br />12. Another album filler. 1/5 <br /> <br />13. I don't see the point with this song. 1/5
B00000F1D3|4.0|I know Cher has always side she never wanted to do dance cause it's not the music she would sing.  But this album ended up being her comeback album, winning her a Grammy, and sold 4x million copies even \\"Believe\\" the single sold 1x million.  I loved of course \\"Believe\\", \\"All or Nothing\\", \\"The Power\\", \\"Taxi, Taxi\\", and the remix of \\"We All Sleep Alone\\".  This album was fun and cool and we saw a fun side of Cher.

B00006CXXU|5.0|I just love Christina Aguilera she has such a fantanic voice.  While others keep hoping Britney will ever sing on stage and do it well, Christina has been doing it since she got started.  I just love this young woman and she has such a career ahead of her.  My favorite tracks were \\"Voice Within\\", \\"Beautiful\\", \\"Fighter\\", \\"Lovin Me 4 Me\\", \\"Durrty\\", and more.
0307276902|4.0|As a person in recovery for 23 years from drugs and alcohol, I must say I am enjoying this book.  It's a fast, gut wrenching read.  However, one thing keeps nagging at me.  In all my years in and around the program, I've never even HEARD of the concept of no local anesthetic (novicaine) during dental work.  I'm not disputing that it actually went down that way, but please....the chemistry of it doesn't even make sense.  A shot of novicaine is not addictive! And you don't get to take any home with you!  This puzzled me so much, that I even went on to Hazelden's site and tried to see what the guidelines were during detox.  No luck finding anything.  I understand the author, James Frey, will be on Oprah this week.  I am anxious to hear his inspiring story first hand and hope they address this issue.
0060594888|5.0|This book lit a fire under me.  I'm only halfway through it, but I'm taking a look at what I really want in my life, making bi-weekly lists of goals, and finding I'm actually meeting them.  Basically, this book is helping me to mentally settle down and take a good hard look at my life and where I want to be.  It's helping me see that anything is possible if I'm willing to believe and work for it.  I highly recommend this book to anyone who's feeling lost right now -- not sure where to go in life but not being happy where you are now.

B00027JYLC|5.0|The glorious masterpiece is a true real nightmare. We end to forget the presence of human beings who live in the dark side of the world. Browning with all the possible realism, shows us the low corners of the human depravation, somewhat it makes us to reflect around the adequate place where the pretended ugliness of the soul habits: are they or on the contrary the sickness triviality of office mercenaries who get some undeniable profits with the morbid exhibition masked beneath the title of entertaining?<br /><br />This terrifying vision around of life and times of weird inhabitants of the sideshow world can shock you; Browning does not employ any special effects; they are real freaks; so the visual impact is even higher than you may expect. I have not had any other reference of his approach 's horror until the entry of Herzog in 1969 with \\"Even dwarfs started small\\" and lately with David Lynch 's \\"Eraser head\\"  and  \\"The elephant man.\\"<br /><br />Not recommended for squeamish.
B0009VRHLK|1.0|As Roger Ebert said, this may be the worst movie ever made.  I consider Buffalo 66 one of the best movies ever made.  I also love most of Gallo's music, but this thing lives up to it's hype.  Thank God I watched this thing with the advantage of having a fast forward button.  I will not provide you with all of the boring details because it's been done so well by others reviewers, and I will not bore you in the same manner Gallo did me.  I am a writer though, and it pains me to slam on a man who supposedly put his heart and soul into his venture.  I can tell you that I've been writing a long time, and I have piles of material.  I have what I consider to be great, poor, and downright awful.  The awful pieces I've written are vanity stories in which all the women in the world love the man.  This is basically what Gallo has written.  Written, what did he really write?  This thing could've been condensed to a 20-30 minute short.  Gallo directed it, but what did he really direct?  My favorite part of this movie is reading how many others were as ticked off by this piece as I was.  I read a few who loved it. I read them, but I don't think any of them were convincing.  I even read a couple who said that this is the type of movie that they wanted to make.  Hey, before you make this pic, send me an email to let me know so I don't make the mistake of attending your movie too.  Due to this film, I probably won't watch another Gallo movie for the rest of my life.
B000035Z3K|5.0|Curiously Tod Browning does not seem to worry by getting special effects or nightmare sequences about this character; instead falling in common places he is more interested to show the psychological feature and a social exploration around the emotive impact of his supernatural presence. At least I din 't experience horror in its straight sense. Browning would seem to emulate the traces of  Caligari instead to follow the accustomed mainstream.<br /><br />Bela Lugosi is admirable in this role; but I insist: if you are looking horror conceived as ra material you may disappoint. In this sense it is recommended; more by the hidden facets than the usual behavior of the personage.
0060922583|5.0|These concepts are not easy.  This book is a legend and will really reward your efforts.  Infinity,the non-existence of time, and multi-dimensions are really beyond our ability to comprehend but this will help.  It will help you take the first step to these dizzying new concepts that are now on the cutting edge of science.
B0000UJL96|5.0|Let me start off by saying that watching the last scene of this movie was hard because it was so well done and it just left you wanting even more from the original crew of the Enterprise in their final performance. Everyone of the cast lived up to the legacy that they had built for themselves and I think it was painful for everyone watching the last scene where the crew say their goodbyes.     The plot revolves around a peace negotiation with the Klingons that goes down a bad path when some of the Klingon officers are murdered and Kirk and Bones are put on trial for their murder. TNG's Michael Dorn represents them as Col. Worf (TNG's Worf's grandfather) which is pretty funny and a great way to have a \\"crossover\\" between the two series. Kirk and McCoy are sent to a mining facility to live out their lives mining and of course run into trouble by the locals who want to murder them. Spock as usual finds a way to bail his friends out and the Enterprise crew saves the day once again. The movie ends with a sentimental ending and the final captain's log.     One of the great things that Star Trek does with its DVDs is it includes great bonus features and the two disc special addition is worth it for any fan. It also contains a tribute to the late Deforest Kelly who died in 1999. Not only does Michael Dorn appear but future member of the Star Trek universe Rene Auberjonois also makes an appearance. Any fan of Star Trek will be very happy with this set.
B0000DZ3IG|5.0|You will love this sound track.  I am a huge fan of this movie and now I love the sound track.  I find myself listening to the more \\"christmas music\\" tracks wanting Christmas to get here.<br /><br />LOVE IT
B0000C8AW5|1.0|Anyone giving a four star review to this is kidding themselves. Its a total dog's breakfast. I'm a Dylan fanatic. I love all but the bottom two or three albums of his catalogue, which I consider Planet Waves to be among. The song-writing is half-baked: the lyrics aren't profound, they're cobbled hurrily together. The Band just aren't tight. They're not playing together. Each song is like a drunken person stumbling: you keep thinking they're going to fall over, and they try really hard to hold themselves together but it doesn't really work. That's the truth about Planet Waves, like no-one else here'll tell you. <br /> <br />doesn't do justice to the album's enduring track Forever Young.
1573301183|5.0|I had the pleasure of seeing AIC on tour with Van Hagar (Halen) in 1991. They blew Van Hagar's door's off! Their shear talent, energy and musicianship were totally inspiring. I went there to see Van Hagar and emerged a lifetime AIC fan. No one has ever better coupled together brooding rock melody with power-chord virtuosity than AIC. Sadly, no one now will. Layne was a one-of-a-kind vocalist, both inspired and tormented by his inner demons and probably, like Cobain before him, hopelessly destined for his ultimate fate. Jerry continues to play and record admirably, but a major piece of him obviously died that fateful day in 2002. <br />It is disconcerting that there are currently so many AIC-derivative bands making a shameless living off of unconvincingly replicating AIC's sound. Inspiration is one thing; sheer plagerism is quite another. Good luck, Jerry; R.I.P. Layne.
0790729350|5.0|Most artists play one or two songs, but the songs chosen are outstanding. The most memorable moment is probably the guitar gymnastics of the lead singer of a band i'd never heard of called \\"Ten Years After\\" who do this medley of old blues standards called \\"I'm Going Home\\" in fast ultra-rock style with outstanding guitar solos. The sequence from The Who's set is also incredible, featuring a song from Tommy. Then there's Janis Joplin, who tears up the stage better than anyone else. <br /> <br />The parts between performances, sometimes overlong, nevertheless help give you an idea of what it might have been like to be there: the arrival sequence, the exciting storm sequence, the arrival of Arlo Guthie by plane, the two interviews with local residents of Woodstock, the scenes of people meditating, skinnydipping, being interviewed about free love and drugs, the announcements \\"there is some bad acid circulating! If you must experiment, only take half a tab!\\" For fans of the music of the time (Janis Joplin, Jimi Hendrix, Crosby Stills and Nash, The Who) and for fans of 70's culture, its a real time capsule.

B0000C8AVX|4.0|The truth is that (if we're being picky) Dylan's peak works Bringing it All Back Home and Highway 61 Revisited do have their dull spots, but only musically. While the poetry is always dazzling in these works there are certain tracks that, in terms of their arrangements, do not have enough variety or complexity to stimulate the audience. These tracks are:    5. Outlaw Blues          6. On the Road Again          7. Bob Dylan's 115th Dream            Which one does grow to love, but they're just basic 12-bar blues with the same instrumentation, similar deliveries so that if you're not paying attention to the lyrics they sound very similar. Bob Dylan's 115th Dream has the distinction of its fun opening where Dylan starts playing then breaks down into laughter then starts playing a second later and the whole band come in exactly right like magic - its special to hear.    But this is a small price to pay for their dazzling lyrics, especially when we have these other tracks with their memorable lyrics AND melodies:    1. Subterranean Homesick Blues          2. She Belongs to Me          3. Maggie's Farm          4. Love Minus Zero/No Limit          8. Mr. Tambourine Man          9. Gates of Eden          10. It's Alright, Ma (I'm Only Bleeding)          11. It's All Over Now, Baby Blue      Among them some of Dylan's finest poetry: i'd place It's Alrght Ma and Gates of Eden in his top 3 lyrics. And Love Minus Zero, Its All Over Now and Mr Tambourine Man i'd place in his top 3 best melodies. All six stand as among his top ten works.    And, finally, She Belongs To Me, is one of his most delightful simpler songs. One you can listen to time and again. \\"She's got everything she needs, she's an artist, she don't look back...\\"
B00005JNJV|3.0|I thought the movie started out slow with \\"Batman\\" not showing up to about an hour into the film but all together an alright film. But I am mad as all get out because I bought the widescreen version from Wal-Mart and then came home to find out that it has no special features. I came on here to find out what was up with that and found that Amazon has a 2 disc version for sale that my Wal-Mart didn't have. I just don't understand why they would release a movie on DVD these days without special features. It has become a common thing for every DVD to get special features especially big name movies like this. There should only be 1 version of a new DVD released so that people don't' buy the wrong one by accident like I did. So now I have to go and spend another $20 to get the 2 disc set. Anyone want to buy the regular version for $15 you can get me on Yahoo Messenger. My name is niner4life8.

HOLMES' rachel dawes is independent but not pushy and she is great to look at and need no 'sexy' wearables to make her presence felt. G. OLDMAN's gordon - man, is he not a great character actor, or what. <br />m. FREEMAN; m CAINE; RUTGER and l.NEESON are all icing to the cake. thorougly enjoyed it the 2nd time and will watch it again and again and again. let's hope, NOLAN and c.

B0006GAOBI|2.0|I much prefer the original. The music selection is a lot different and for me the music in the original set the tone. Most upsetting is the abscence The Church's song at the Halloween party. Otherwise it is the same movie with a few extra scenes and extra sci-fi fillers.
B000AU9UYC|1.0|I really enjoyed watching all of the Batman movies except for this one.  I just don't think Bale was the right chose to play Batman.  Everytime he spoke with that low corse voice, he really annoyed me.  He seemed like he had to force himself to be Batman unlike Michael Keaton or Clooney which seemed more comfortable playing Batman.  The only thing that I enjoyed was the very beginning where you see the special effects of bunch of bats flying around, and way at the background you see a huge Batman figure.  There just wasn't very much action in the movie, there's ton of talking though.  When it came to action, the camera made it look like MTV video, the action was shown very quickly so that you don't fully see the fights.  I wish our actors and actresses learn how to do kung fu, karate or other martial arts like the asian actors do.  I'm just so sick and tired of watching same actors and actresses on t.v. (Brad Pitt, Tom Cruise, Nicole Kidman, Julia Roberts, Holly Berry, Christen Bale, etc).  They seem to focus on their looks and not actual talents like knowing martial arts.  I would like to see more newcomers in movies.
B000HEWEDK|5.0|Hey, most of us know that Forbidden Planet is quite likely the most influential sci-fi movie in history, and rightly so.  (In fact, I remember back in the early 1990's when DVDs first started appearing in stores, and Forbidden Planet was one of the very first movies to go onto DVD.)<br /><br />I ordered this 50th anniversary edition as quickly as I could move my mouse and type, but it took me a few months to actually get around to watching it.<br /><br />I've seen this movie many times.  What I really was looking forward to was the bonus material that came with the movie.  All I can say is that the bonus features made it worth the price of purchasing the DVD set.<br /><br />First, the Additional Scenes are priceless.  I'd actually seen them before because I own the Criterion Collection laser disc (retailed for $100 ten years ago), but I don't have a laser disc player, so I finally got to see these scenes again on a media I can play whenever I want.  Cool!<br /><br />Second the \\"Lost Footage\\" is just about as priceless as the deleted scenes.  There's even an alternate introductory narrative where you hear the words \\"planet\\" and \\"federation\\" used together almost ten years before those words became legendary.<br /><br />The Excerpts from The MGM Parade TV Series are basically Walter Pidgeon advertising the movie at the end of this TV show.  Short, but can anything with Walter Pidgeon not be great?<br /><br />The All-new Amazing! Exploring the Far Reaches of Forbidden Planet\\" featurette is a rather good documentary.  I just wish it had been longer, but that's the way it goes.  Ann Francis looks amazingly good even to this day.<br /><br />The Robby the Robot: Engineering a Sci-Fi Icon was an unexpected surprise and very entertaining.  No, it's not the Lost in Space robot.  It's a different robot.  In fact, there's an episode of Lost in Space where both robots appear together.  I wish this documentary had shown us all the places where Robby appeared through the years.  Robby was in an original Twilight Zone episode (as were many of the props from Forbidden Planet) but no mention was made of this.<br /><br />So, the worst thing I can say about the documentaries is that there could have been more, but at least they're there.<br /><br />The TCM documentary Watch the Skies!: Science Fiction, the 1950s and Us seemed like filler, but at least it puts Forbidden Planet in its historical context and illustrates just what a revolutionary movie it was.<br /><br />The Invisible Boy is a barely watchable (unless you just love Mystery Science Theater type corny sci-fi) movie that features the same robot coincidentally (yeah right) named Robby.  In this movie, Robby is evil, and the boy is about the most loathsome and unlikeable boy ever to star in any sci-fi movie I've seen.  I watched this movie on my flat panel TV during a treadmill workout, so at least I didn't waste any time.  If you want to see Robby do evil things and speak with a bad voice, watch this.<br /><br />I haven't watched the Thin Man TV Series Robot Client episode yet.<br /><br />So, there's an overview of the bonus features.  I hope it helps your purchase decision.ere many of the props from Forbidden Planet) but no mention was made of this.

0307276902|4.0|James Frey's memoir of his six weeks in rehab gives an insider view of the challenges of recovery, a view I appreciated since I have a sibling who is a long-time alcoholic (and who lost everything in his service to his disease).  This book gave me a greater appreciation for the very real and compelling difficulties of getting and staying clean.  It's written \\"coldly\\", that is, without apologies or complaints (in general) and the story itself and its many characters make it a page-turner.  I would have liked to understand them in more depth, however, something that Frey appears to have been unwilling to do.  Action rather than introspection is the focus of the work; the reader will not hear the author explain much, if anything, on motives or perspectives on the action.  This withholding both enhances and inhibits the book. In the end I felt that his withholding marred Frey's account and that is why I could not give his book five stars.  Enduring through a horrific ordeal and remaining outside the grip of addiction are admirable, no question. I applaud Frey for being forthcoming about the surface details of his experience, including his confession of the crimes committed as an addict. Writing the story and yet failing to give a richer, deeper perspective, one wrought from honest and vulnerable introspection--a kind of recollection in traquility--made me leave the experience of reading his book with a sense that something crucial was missing.  If you like to read a book just for story, this is a terrific account of the visceral experience of recovery.  If you want to know what is in the mind of the addict on the road to recovery, what the psychological experience is like and what drives an individual toward the will to recover, you may find yourself somewhat disappointed.
B00005JNTX|4.0|Frank Miller's graphic novel is truly graphic in every sense of the word.  The directors utilize everything from montage sequences, deliberate continuity breaks, plot regression, and highly stylized action sequences to pull the viewer into the movie. Overall a fantastic experience.

B00000255F|5.0|\\"Born to Run\\" is Bruce Springsteen's masterpiece, much like T.S. Elliot's \\"Wasteland\\", Marilyn Monroe's \\"Some Like it Hot\\", F. Scott Fitzgerald's \\"Great Gatsby\\", and Picasso's \\"Guernica\\" it speaks of time and place and yet remains timeless and universal. It is hard to believe that it is now 30 years old, yet retaining the power of any masterpiece, which is the power to speak across time and space to address the human experience while remaining true to its art form, in this case popular music.<br /><br />There are few works of art that have raw power, the power to amaze and transfix. Like Soutine's famous paintings of raw carcases of beef flesh, \\"Born to Run\\" hits in the gut and in the heart.  The Amazon 5 star rating does not apply to some works of art, and \\"Born to Run\\" is one of those works.<br /><br />Springsteen sings of a New Jersey wasteland, in which blue collar expectations are tempered with the optimism of youth, fueled by lust and the desire to reinvent our lives.<br /><br />Springsteen was not one of these poets, \\"Born to Run\\" is as honest a stand as exists in American music history.

0812975219|2.0|I had high hopes when I picked up the book.  There's a great story here -- how people are foolish in their behaviors and expectations with respect to events that transpire around them.  However, the book reads more like an exposition of how wonderful the author is in recognizing this effect, and how ridiculous everyone else is for not recognizing this themselves.  I'll agree with him that there's huge randomness in who is \\"lucky enough\\" to be in the right place, at the right time, practicing the right strategy for that time, in order to get rich.  However, there's nothing rigorous in here that tells me that the author's strategy is better -- how do I know he's also not employing a strategy that ultimately is not worth more than anyone else's strategy?  He's definitely smarter than the average guy, but lots of smart people have employed poor strategic choices.   I'm on the lookout for a better description of this arena.
B000000W8C|4.0|It's just incredible to me that Verve (or \\"The Verve,\\" if you prefer) released only three albums.  Their second album, \\"Northern Soul,\\" perfectly bridges the lush swirling guitar sounds of \\"A Storm In Heaven,\\" and the more mainstream, heavily orchestrated \\"Urban Hymns.\\"  While guitarist Nick McCabe clearly dominated \\"Storm,\\" on \\"Northern Soul\\" (and continuing with \\"Urban Hymns\\") their is no doubt that vocalist, Richard Ashcroft, became the leader and chief visionary of the band.  As compared to the prior album, Ashcroft sings with much more emotional depth and confidence.  His lyrics are almost achingly personal and painful.  It's notable how he uses repetition of certain phrases to imply deeper meaning in a number of songs, much the same way that the brilliant Thom Yorke of Radiohead does this. <br /> <br />While \\"Northern Soul\\" is a fine and consistent album (I like several of the tracks alot, namely \\"A New Decade,\\" \\"This is Music,\\" \\"On Your Own,\\" \\"So It Goes,\\" \\"History,\\" \\"No Knock On My Door\\"), I don't think it reaches the level of the best portions of \\"Storm\\" or \\"Hymns,\\" wich is why I gave it \\"only\\" four stars.  Additionally some of the songs run on a verse or two too long.  Nevertheless, \\"Northern Soul,\\" holds its own as part of the extraordinary Verve trilogy of albums.  Why did they break up?

0783226837|5.0|Tremors is a really great sci-fi adventure comedy starring Kevin Bacon,Fred Ward and Micheal Gross.This movie is really  funny and entertaining.Giant prehistoric worms(aptly named Graboids),has the folks in a small desert town running for their lives and our heroes(Bacon,Ward and Gross)has to figure out away to save them and themselves from becoming worm meat.Get ready for some laughs.The desert scenery is just breathtaking.It's the greatest highlight of the movie,if you've watched the dvd, then you'll see what I'm talking about,it's the perfect location.After all,the Graboids need to burrow undeground and what better place to do so.The dvd sound and picture quality is pretty good(The Tremors Attack Pack is wonderful collection with all four movies at a great price for all Tremors fans!)
B000AARKOO|5.0|Every time you turn around there's someone lamenting about the lack of quality films coming out of Hollywood; and it's usually some whiny conservative crying about Hollywood's liberal bias.  The problem is, when Hollywood does create good quality films -- and believe it or not, there are several -- no one goes to see them.  Kingdom of Heaven is, in my opinion, a prime example of that.  This is the best presentation of the Crusades I have ever seen.  It not only shows the heroism of the men and women who thought they were doing God's work, but also the futility of the entire exercise.  The films also does an admirable job of presenting the Crusades in as even-handed a manner as possible. Both Christians and Muslims are presented without bias one way or another -- at least for the most part.  Usually, in films of this nature, the Christians are shown as these flawless heroes setting out to free the Holy Land from the clutches of the heathen Muslims, but not Kingdom of Heaven.  I would say this film does the best job of presenting both the good and the bad qualities of both sides, and leaving the audience to draw their own conclusions.  Of course, this film does have some biases.  At it's heart the film is very anti-war, not to mention anti-religion.  The anti-war part comes through in its depiction of King Baldwin (played by Edward Norton behind a mask) who would rather make Jerusalem of city for all faiths, with the help of Saladin, of course.  However, forces out of his control conspire to take Jerusalem to war and remove Baldwin from the throne.  It is anti-religion not because of any hatred towards religion, but because the Church used its influence with the populace to drive the Crusade and were usually the first to run and hide when the going got tough.  These are, of course, reasons why conservatives would cry liberal bias, but that's only because they are often too narrow-minded to see anything beyond a rigid set of ideas. <br /> <br />The cast of this film isexcellent.  This is the best work I've seen out of Orlando Bloom; Marton Csokas is wonderfully evil as Guy de Lusignan; and Ghassan Massoud gives a very interesting portrayal of Saladin.  Of special note is Edward Norton who plays the role of King Baldwin from behind a mask that hides the character's leprosy.  This film is epic in the finest sense of the word and deserved far more attention than it received at thebox office.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|It's been taking Depeche Mode 4 years now to get us a new album since the early 90s, from 1993's \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\" to 1997's \\"Ultra\\" to 2001's \\"Exciter\\" to now \\"Playing the Angel\\". Other than the very disappointing \\"Exciter\\" album, they have been great albums. So how does \\"Playing the Angel\\" stack up?<br /><br />\\"Playing the Angel\\" (12 tracks, 52 min.) is, thankfully, a LOT better than the less than exciting \\"Exciter\\", which is no doubt the weakest outing of Depeche Mode. The new album can easily be divided in 2 parts. The first half of the album is outstanding, and is a return to the soundscape of the 1990 album \\"Violator\\", DM's most popular album. First single \\"Precious\\" is a carbon copy in sound of \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" and the standout track of the album. \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\" reminds me of \\"World in My Eyes\\". Lead vocalist David Gohan (coming of his 2003 solo album Paper Monsters) contributes 3 tracks, including the great \\"Suffer Me\\". I rate the first half of the album 4.5 stars. Unfortunately the second half is less enthralling and simply drags on too long, although it contains the great track \\"Lilian\\". I rate the second half of the album 3.5 stars.<br /><br />Depeche Mode celebrates its 25th anniversary this year. Who could've imagined in 1980 that this band would be around for so long, and still be relevant? \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a nice album, no question about it. But for DM at its peak, check out \\"Violator\\" or \\"Songs of Faith and Devotion\\". That said, DM remains a superb live act, and if you have a chance to see them on the \\"Touring the Angel\\" tour, don't miss them!
B0000931QA|1.0|I thought I would buy the RE-MASTERED CD and get a better Sonic quality. What I found to my Shock and Horror, is that they introduced so much digital clipping and distortion that I can not stand to listen to this version. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I think this is one of THE GREATEST albums ever made in it's original release. <br /> <br />I even exchanged the cd for another thinking it was a problem with the disk, but this did not help, as they all have the hidious distortion. <br /> <br />I tried to contact the record company, but there is no way to get a hold of anyone to let them know someone really screwed up on this album. <br /> <br />There is Clipping, Sizzling, and clicks that are not in the original release. <br /> <br />Listen to the beginning of \\"I don't believe in Love\\" and you will hear all kinds of sizzle and crunch. This is all throughout this CD. <br /> <br />Whom ever Re-mastered this cd should be shot

B000003TAR|5.0|In Utero is the final studio album of the early 90's pop/rock/grunge/punk trio Nirvana and one of their most critically acclaimed (but you probably knew all that). It's a record of contradictions, biting and sardonic yet beautiful and uplifting. It's honestly one of the best albums I've ever heard, and while I don't consider myself an expert, it still stands above all but a handful of rock opuses. Onto the individual songs: <br /> <br />1. Serve the Servants - A bit of an odd way to start an album but a decent song nonetheless. It's sarcastic and brutal and with a slow, trudging sound to it. <br /> <br />2. Scentless Apprentice - Even more brutal and trudging than Serve the Servants, with the lyrics inspired by the novel Perfume and the riff designed by Grohl pounding it out on his drums (as you can hear in the embryonic version of the song on With the Lights out) as well as some of the best drumming done by Grohl yet. <br /> <br />3. Heart-Shaped Box - The first single off the album, and admittedly one of the highlights of the album. Utilizing a simple and effective guitar riff under confusing and abstract lyrics detailing a relationship gone awry. The only song from the album to garner an accompying music video, which is startling and brilliant in its own right. <br /> <br />4. Rape Me - The riff is (very) reminiscent of their breakthrough hit Smells Like Teen Spirit, in a self-conscious parody of it. At its base the lyrics deal with a man who goes to jail for rape and ends up raped himself (showcasing Cobain's sense of irony) and on a deeper level showing the way the music industry \\"rapes\\" the artist. <br /> <br />5.France Farmer Will Have Her Revenge On Seattle - One of the best songs on the album and of the harder, rockier stuff my pick for the best. Simple and great guitar and fiery, self-righteous lyrics. <br /> <br />6. Dumb - The first really melancholy song on the album and at the one of its peaks. Wedged between Frances Farmer and the snarling Very Ape it's a fragile and tender look at what was going on in Cobain's head. <br /> <br />7. Very Ape - Less important than most of the fully developed songs, it's fairly short and racuous. Not the best but it serves a purpose in defining and contrasting with Dumb. <br /> <br />8. Milk It - A trifle menacing, and with dark subdued lyrics. The chorus of Doll Steak Test Meat Look on the bright side is suicide is very spine tingling. <br /> <br />9. Pennyroyal Tea - One of the better songs on an album filled with great songs. With a slower tempo and moody lyrics it works great here, and is very effective done acoustically (as seen on Unplugged in New York). <br /> <br />10. Radio Friendly Unit Shifter - Ironic title, eh? The song itself is anything but radio friendly, with squalls of feedback throughout. The lyrics are some of Cobain's best, easily relatable with and very sincere. <br /> <br />11. Tourettes - Like Very Ape this is more or less a \\"throwaway\\" which serves its purpose by being loud and boisterous, to give definition to the closing All Apologies. Mostly just a bunch of screaming and power chords. <br /> <br />12. All Apologies - One of the songs in the Nirvana catalogue where the reputation precedes the music itself. Really brilliant and tear-jerking stuff, especially as the album fades out with \\"All in all is all we all are\\". <br /> <br />So, yeah. If you go in expecting another Nevermind you most likely will be disappointed. If you come ready for deep(er) song writing and a wider array of musical style you'll probably come off pleased with In Utero.
1400043662|5.0|Finished Haruki Murakami's Kafka on the Shore today. Man, what a book. Blown away, I was. Now I begin to understand why this cat is considered one of the coolest, hippest literary novelists around, and one of the biggest sellers. Not just in his homeland, Japan, but everywhere around the world.<br /><br />The first thing I did was look for his other novel, also considered one of his best,<br /><br />The Wind-up Bird Chronicle, and it's on my shelf, mewling and miaowing in anticipation. (I tried all the Mumbai bookstores without luck, then happened to be at Inorbit Mall, Malad (W), after a trip to my C.A. to finalize accounts for last f.y., and there it was, perched on a bottom shelf, flicking its tail and squinting its eyes at me in that lazy, sun-dazed way that cats have at high noon. I picked it up and carried it to the counter, stroking it lovingly, ignoring the stares of the baffled salespersons.)<br /><br />In case I haven't drowned you in the cat metaphors yet (an important part of Murakami's writing, just as white dogs are an integral obsession in the novels of Jonathon Carroll, another brilliant fabulist who boldly straddles the train-tracks that separate Literary Awardland from Genre Fantasyland) here's one more catty comment: This is a novel that leaves you feeling like a Siamese with a belly full of fish and fresh cream.<br /><br />Murakami's prose, even in translation from the original Japanese, is perfect for the kind of story he tells. Simple, spare, yet unafraid to launch into flights of fantasy at a moment's notice. The story unfolds in parallel tracks. One, the main storyline, is about a 15-year old boy who leaves home, and his negligent self-obsessed father, and embarks on a long journey, presumably to find his long lost mother and elder sister, but also just to get away from his father, his life, himself. As anyone who has read enough fantasy-and this is a fantasy, whatever you choose to classify it as-knows that a new identity must begin with a new name. And the name our protagonist chooses for himself is Kafka. Not without significance, he keeps his father's surname, Tamura. Becoming Kafka Tamura.<br /><br />The other parallel track is about an old feeble-minded man named Nakata who ekes out a living on his government sub city (subsidy but the mispronunciation is also not without significance, for Nakata will descend eventually into a sub city) and makes some extra yen on the side as a cat detective. Yes, you read that right. Cat detective. Because, you see, a long time ago, when he was very young, he suffered an incident which left him severely mentally impaired, and with a new mental faculty he hadn't possessed earlier: the ability to speak cat. He puts his ability to good use, seeking out lost domestic cats for a small fee and some of his favourite foods-\\"Nakata loves eel,\\" he tells everyone he meets, several times over, usually until they feed him some eel. He's pretty good at it, too, and some of the most enchanting scenes in the book deal with him interviewing cats and the remarkable conversations he has with them.<br /><br />The novel follows these two characters' points of view in a simple, alternate-chapter structure. Now, I'm not going to tell you the whole story. But you should know this:<br /><br />If you've ever read and loved a Stephen King novel, you can't not go crazy with happiness reading this novel. Seriously. I don't give an ass' hoot whether the bigtime literary critics consider mentioning Stephen King and Murakami in the same breath to be some kind of literary blasphemy-they probably do. I can hear Harold Bloom turning over in his grave, and he isn't even dead! :~)<br /><br />But without trying to elevate Stephen King to Nobel Prize stature, or to denigrate Murakami in any fashion, the resemblance is startlingly obvious. There's a recurring character-type in Stephen King's novels: the simple-minded country bumpkin or mentally challenged boy who speaks of himself in the third person and has some favourite catch-phrase he throws at everyone he meets (\\"Wolf! Wolf! Right here and now!\\" in The Talisman; \\"Moon! That spells Tom Cullen, it does.\\" in The Stand and so on) and that's what Nakata resembles so eerily.<br /><br />It's hard to think that Murakami might never have read Stephen King but I guess it's possible. But then how do you explain the other motifs that resemble King's work-the runaway boy backpacking it (a la The Stand) and the Bad Guy with long boots, black cloak and hat and sentient black dog and all (The Stand, and other books) and a hundred other small but significant similarities? Nah. I'd wager money on it.<br /><br />Murakami loves his Stephen King. He's just lucky enough to be packaged and marketed as a literary master instead of a Japanese fantasy novelist.<br /><br />Either way, the point is that this is a novel that's as easy to read and as enjoyable as a Stephen King novel. And it's a great novel.I know that Murakami is looked down on by a lot of Japanese readers and critics who consider him a \\"sell-out\\" who doesn't capture the real Japan or portray Japanese life and culture accurately. I respect that point of view. In India, we often have the same kind of bitching about our own authors. Last I checked, there was a movement to add a new section to the IPC (Indian Penal Code, another marvelous legacy we inherited from our British forebears-\\"Thank you, old chum, whatever would we do without all your antiquated laws?\\" \\"Oh, pshaw. Don't mention it.\\"), the new section being specifically targeted at Indian authors who find success selling their novels overseas!<br /><br />Anyway, so I understand that Murakami may not be seen in the same light as, say, Kenzuburo Oe or Soseki Natsume or Yukio Mishima, and I won't claim to have read enough Japanese literature to draw a final conclusion, but I'll say this, I know a great novel when I read one, and Kafka on the Shore is one of the best. Read it, and keep your Stephen King close at hand. And tell me if you don't see the similarities. But most of all, enjoy this novel, for that's what it' s meant for, not to be analyzed to death, or debated over by anal-retentive academics in dusty committee halls; simply read, reread, and enjoyed, down to the last delicious lick of the last savoury page.<br /><br />Purrrr.he third person and has some favourite catch-phrase he throws at everyone he meets (\\"Wolf!

B000A0GP4K|4.0|Finally a good documentary on Bob Dylan!  What I liked best about this film:  great concert footage including audience booing when he played his electric guitar, Bob Dylan today commenting on aspects of his early career, backstage film clips, getting background on the folk music scene at the time, seeing Al Kooper, Joan Baez and Maria Muldar among others relating stories and the long running time, enough to include lots of music and old clips.  The film seems to end pretty much when Dylan had his motorcycle accident in 1966. Some things that struck me - how incredibly lame some of the questions from the press were at the time to Dylan, a \\"misunderstanding\\" between Baez and Dylan still exists today, how changeable Dylan's choice of music has been (rock,folk, protest (anti-war), country) - is this to maintain his or his audience's interest?, and the utter beauty of Joan Baez's voice.  Extras include concert footage. Recommended.

0345456343|5.0|Anne Rice revamped the vampire-horror genre with the publication of \\"Interview with the Vampire,\\" a supernational drama from the vampire's own mouth. It became an unexpected hit, and spawned a series of sequels that came to be known as the Vampire Chronicles. The first three books of the series are compiled here, and arguably remain her best.<br /><br />\\"Interview With the Vampire\\" is the story of Louis, a grieving young widower and plantation owner, whose life is turned upside down when he meets the charming vampire Lestat. Lestat offers him a way out: become a vampire. Louis accepts, but once it's done, he finds that vampirism is more than he bargained for -- especially for his conscience.<br /><br />\\"The Vampire Lestat\\" takes a totally different tack, showing us the world through the enigmatic, charming Lestat's eyes. After years of dormancy, Lestat wakes up in time for the early MTV years of the 1980s, becoming a rock star in the tradition of Ozzy and Black Sabbath. And like Louis, Lestat relates his long life's story -- how he became a vampire, his wanderings over the earth, and his investigations into the origins of vampirism itself...<br /><br />\\"Queen of the Damned\\" builds on that research. Lestat's metal music has caused quite a bit of mayhem -- but not this much before: Akasha, Egyptian queen and mother of all vampires, has reawoken from her comalike sleep. The lesser vampires are having strange dreams, some are being murdered by the ruthless queen. Apparently she wants to kill virtually all men. What is more, Akasha has taken a shine to the roguish Lestat himself...<br /><br />Vampiric autobiography is a given in Anne Rice's bibliography -- she has plenty of bloodsuckers telling us about their lives. But Lestat and Louis's were not just the first ones, but perhaps the most compelling and rich, especially since the two had such radically different viewpoints -- including of one another. Is Lestat a heartless fiend, or a roguish good-craving bad boy? I'd lean towards the latter, to be honest.<br /><br />The first two books are quite personal -- one is Louis recounting his own miserable life and un-life. Then we get Lestat, a radically different viewpoint, a guy who enjoys his un-life even more than his mortal existance. Finally, there's an epic view of all vampires, throughout history, from the ancient Egyptian queen to the modern biker vamps.<br /><br />Despite the more controversial recent novels, Anne Rice's first Vampire Chronicles are often reckoned to be modern horror classics. Rich, intriguing and far deeper than you'd think vampire fiction would be.bad boy?

B000B2YQX4|1.0|If you have heard the track \\"Precious\\" and thought that this was a taste of things to come on this album, YOU WERE WRONG. <br /> <br />This is so bad, it doesn't even sound like DM. It sounds like REO Speedwagon or The Eagles with a few plinky-plonky synth sounds thrown in. A self-indulgent journey that fits the description of Banal Rock rather than any other genre. Structure-less songs a wash with the most childishly written lyrics. It's a shame there isn't a way to give it MINUS 5 stars, because that's what I'd give it. IGNORE ALL THE OBVIOUS PLANTS BY THE RECORD COMPANY IN THIS REVIEW SECTION SAYING IT'S GREAT AND COMPARING IT TO OTHER DM WORKS. IT HAS ****NOTHING**** TO DO WITH OTHER DEPECHE MODE RELEASES. Do yourself a favour and buy a Pink Floyd or Emerson, Lake & Palmer record if you want some crappy 70's rock with a smattering of synth sounds. It doesn't deserve to have the DM name on the cover.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|After all the glowing reviews ahead of the album's release I was counting down the days until its release.  At the time, I had  heard just Precious and thought it was the best DM song since Violator.  This is truly one of the the best albums of DM's illustrious career and ranks just below Violator and Music for the Masses as their best.  It would have been the perfect follow up to Violator.<br /><br />One of the things I love about DM is Dave Gahan's deep booming vocals which were sadly absent from their last two releases. On this album Dave's deep, trademark vocals are back.  I love the faster pacing of the album and the heavier industrial sound. But it's the songs and the strong melodies that ultimately carries the album.  Though it's hard to choose from such great songs, here are my favorites in order:<br /><br />1  Precious (beautiful haunting melody that stays with you. Excellent choice as the first single)<br />2  A Pain that I'm Used to (incredible hook laden song once you get past the horrible \\"noise\\" that prefaces the track)<br />3  John the Revelator (strong melody a la Personal Jesus. Could have easily been the lead-off single)<br />4  Nothing's Impossible (love Dave's deep vocals on this track. I just can't get this tune out of the head.  Plus, it has that great industrial sound that sounds even better in DTS 5.1.  See below)<br />5  Suffer Well (the 2nd of two excellent song from Gahan)<br />6  Lilian (awesome melody. Could be another single)<br />7  I Want it All<br />8  The Darkest Star<br />9  Damaged People (very nice M. Gore vocal and tune)<br />10  The Sinner in Me<br />11  Macro (not as bad as many think but there are just too many great songs on this album)<br /><br />All in all an excellent album.  I find myself wanting to listen to it over and over again.  IMO, the best album of the year, much better than the latest Stones and Coldplay offerings (both of which I own and enjoy).  I hope this album gives DM the attention and recognition they deserve.<br /><br />Incidentally, I bought the special edition which I strongly recommend.  The DTS 5.1 sound is very well mixed and I actually prefer it to the CD version.trongly recommend.  The DTS 5.1 sound is very well mixed and I actually prefer it to the CD version.
B000AYEIZY|1.0|I was first introduced to Cream at about 12 when my father was teaching me to play bass. He played that now infamous, classic riff from \\"Sunshine of your love\\" and a love affair with classic rock began right then and there. I consumed every Cream album I could find, learning to cop every note and every riff, first on the bass and later when I switched to guitar. With their almost random soloing, jazz and bluesey beats, and sheer intensity, it seemed there was always something new I would hear every time I listened. <br /> <br />Cut 15 years later, and I come across what I thought to be a \\"new\\" vintage recording from its psychedelic packaging. When I find out it was from this past year, even better! Eric Clapton's latest outings have been so blues related and based that I've been longing to hear some of that rock intensity that seems to have escaped him in his later years, no matter how unworldly his guitar skills may be. <br /> <br />This is the first disc in my life I've sold used. I had it for a day. All it took, really, was to listen to \\"Crossroads\\". Plodding along with an almost intentional disregard for sounding anything like any Cream recording that has come before, the track simply has no energy. Claptons uninspired solos over most of the album left me feeling he might have done this project just because one or more of the band needed some cash. \\"Crossroads\\" is, at its heart, a Robert Johnson blues song, but this is Cream, and this is Eric Clapton, the team who recorded, live, one of the greatest \\"guitar hero\\", ear-blasting, boundless energy tracks to come out of the late 60s. A track that no-doubtedly influenced many, if not most, guitar rock bands to come a long after. <br /> <br />The tempo for the rest of the album was no better, with each and every song played much too slow to be suitable. We've all heard these songs for years and years, and our mental recordings know the tempo. When you play them too slow, it makes it difficult to tap your foot or singalong with, leaving you feeling that this could be any band from any time period, and, in fact, it could. <br /> <br />Even more grating to my ear was the lack of Wah-Wah on \\"White Room\\" which was, once again, painfully slow. The song lost most of its presence without the highpitched squeels and psychedelic fret-board burning soloing typicly heard throughout. <br /> <br />I will give the album one fairly good track, \\"Badge\\", although even this George Harrison inspired tune isn't enough to redeam this album at its high price. <br /> <br />Cream will always be an innovative band, with a distinctive sound that revolutionized rock as a whole. But if this is the best the boys can do these days, then I hope they take the money and hang up their hats, because this was just not Cream in any sense.
6305313687|5.0|I do think this is a brilliant film and an extraordinary performance by edward norton, i also do agree with some reviews about the mixed feelings. It mainly focuses on white supremacy, but we never see the other side to racism which were only a few parts in the movie when the african american boys were teasing furlong for being white and making racist comments. The whole movie is focuses on skinheads being racist against blacks, hispanics, and jews, but we hardly get much from the other perspective which is the ones racosxt against whites. But yes it's a nazi movie so i can understand why it's so one sided. There are a few flaws, but i do believe the most important points were focused on in the film, and the main issue is violence associated with racism. But many parts seemed a little unrealistic like the bastketball scene. Come on, if the skinheads won in real life, and they dont the black guys to get their \\"black asses off the court\\" that would have resulted in some sort of fight or worse, and lets not forget the slam dunk by norton, which always made me and my roomate laugh. I know it's a movie and it's suppose to be sensationalized. Despite it's flaws it's still a very good film that people can learn from. Whenever i hear this movie being mentioned, i always hear how hard it has hit it's viewers and the strong ,message that it has, which defeats the little flaws it has, it's still a great film <br /> <br />As for the murder scene. I do feel you have a right to protect your family and property, and the black males did have guns, but why were they strapped while stealing a car, and one guy waiting near the front door, and they only fleed because norton had a gun and chased them while shooting. I'm not condoning the curb murder, which was brutal, and it was a genius way to show the fact that norton was losing his mind up till that point, and thats why he's smiling like a lunatic when the police get there. I dont think the reviewers were saying it was fine doing that, it's just mixed feelings about protecting your family and property. But yes the crypts were fleeing, after trying to steal the truck, and had guns, but thats no excuse to commit that haneous murder, by splitting the guys head open on the curb. That scene was written in to reflect dereyk's frame on mind at the time, and then going to prison, where he has a chance to think about his life of hatred, and his crime.
B000002UAU|5.0|Out of all of The Beatles albums, Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band is my absolute favorite! Each song offers something different. I can't really say if I have an individual favorite song off of this album because I love the entire cd! It's all great and I highly recommend that you buy it if you don't have it yet.
B0001UL7RY|5.0|Avril Lavigne is an amazing artist.  And this CD is one of the best CDs I own.  Lavigne's music is as powerful as anything I have heard.  Anyone who criticizes her is just jealous of her enormous success.  Maybe she just makes it look too easy?<br /><br />\\"Take Me Away\\" has so many twist and turns it is like three songs in one.  So if you buy this CD, right off that bat you've already got more than you bargained for.  I could listen to this song twice-a-day for the rest of my life.  You rock Avril!  Don't let anyone tell you different!<br /><br />\\"Together\\" starts off quite slow.  The first time I heard it, I wasn't sure where it was going.  But it quickly comes together, and I've learned to love this song as much as the rest of the tracks on this CD.<br /><br />\\"Don't Tell Me\\" proves that Avril can do anything.  I can't imagine another human being pulling this song off.  Lavigne has amazing versatility.  She does everything in this song.  I hate profanity in music, yet Lavigne manages to somehow tackle tough words and subjects and make it sound like poetry!  Lavigne for president!  Oh, never mind, she's Canadian, ain't she?  Anyhow, I love this song.<br /><br />\\"He Wasn't\\" reminds me of some eighties hits, only Lavigne isn't taking it so serious.  I think this song shows how fun-loving Lavigne is.  I'm not sure I have ever said so many good things about a Canadian before!<br /><br />\\"How Does It Feel\\" puts Lavigne's voice out above the music.  She deserves every cent she receives for this CD!  This song is so good that I don't even know how to describe how good it is!  I'm just gonna move on to the next song!<br /><br />\\"My Happy Ending\\" is one of the biggest hits on this CD.  If you haven't heard it, you're a geek!  Another song I could listen to once-a-day for the rest of my natural life.  Oh, I forgot, there is a ad word in this song to, but somehow Lavigne makes it sound okay.  Must be the Canadian accent!<br /><br />\\"Nobody's Home\\" is a powerful song about losing our way.  You know how you buy an artist's CD and then get home to listen to the whole thing, only to find out there are only two or three good songs on the CD?  Well that doesn't happen on this CD!  Every song on this CD kicks butt!<br /><br />\\"Forgotten\\" is a little bit scary!  Good bass, good beat, nice change ups and crossovers.  Each time I hear this song I like it a little more.  This is a ROCK song if there ever was!<br /><br />\\"Who Knows\\" is smooth as music can be, a perfect flowing hit song!  You are a star Avril.  Anyone tell you that yet?<br /><br />\\"Fall to Pieces\\" continues to prove this musician doesn't make bad songs.  Is there any wonder why this CD is loved by so many.<br /><br />\\"Freak Out\\" is powerful, funky, fun, and nothing to freak out about!  I love the guitar on this one.  By the way, if you're reading this review - just click the buy button!  Everything I am saying about this CD is 100% true!<br /><br />\\"Slipped Away\\" A nice soft ending.<br /><br />This is one of my favorite CDs.  Avril Lavigne is a great singer, songwriter, and musician.  If you don't own this CD, you need to.  If you love music, this is a must-own CD.<br /><br />See ya next review!song about losing our way.

B000B9EY2U|5.0|Okay, just stating the credentials here, I was in early elementary school when \\"Just Can't Get Enough\\" came out and have been a fan of DM ever since, moreso when I hit adolescence and saw all of absolute goddesses who were into DM as well.  Translation: Anything this band so much as sneezes on, I'm on it like meth addict taking advantage of a sale on Sudafed.<br /><br />You've seen the film _The Christmas That Almost Wasn't_, right?  This is _The Depeche Mode Album That Almost Wasn't_.  After Exciter, Dave Gahan went solo on _Paper Monsters_, which sounded pretty much like a Depeche Mode album.  Unless Martin Gore allowed him to contribute some material, he was going to continue on that trajectory.  Either way would have been fine with me as Dave is now and ever shall be the voice/heart/soul of the band.<br /><br />On with the review...<br /><br />I really can't say what others have not said and said better when praising this album.  It seems like people are criticizing the work for sounding too much like the Depeche Mode we know and love, much like their fellow 1980s mope masters the Church were for Priest = Aura.  When one considers how close this album came to not happening, it would not be regarded as out of line to tell the detractors to SHUT UP AND ENJOY THE CD.  I'd enjoy the silence (BOO!  BAD PUN!).  The lads mix concerns of humanity with electronics and the result sounds like aural sex (BOO!  ANOTHER BAD PUN!).  It's the same as what you've heard before from DM, but why fix what isn't broken?<br /><br />Picks: If I have to go with one, I like their adaptation of \\"John the Revelator,\\" especially given the political climate here in the states.<br /><br />Signed,<br /><br />epsteinsmutha
B000ASATWQ|5.0|People have said they like Damian Marley's music for its beats and its hooks, but I think Damian's true talent lies elsewhere. This fellow's music is nothing short of the modern \\"chattin\\" equivalent to the Wailer's deep, magical and legendary tunes. With his infinite flow techniques, Damian shows us in this album that he also deserves the title his father's still-selling album was dubbed with - \\"Legend\\". Yes, I said it. Damian is no ordinary dee-jay.  Each song of this spectacular album reminds you of the \\"royal\\" blood that flows through his veins. xUnlike his contemporaries and chat-jay counterparts, Sean Paul and Elephant man, Damian is very intelligent. His music is always to-the-point and it always has a point. He does not dedicate hours to singing the praises of marijuana, or to the description of dances (yes, Elephant Man does do that).  <br /> <br />\\"Welcome to Jamrock is really welcomin yuh to de lives of Jamaican citizens, as opposed to what de tourists come and experience in Jamaica. Jamaica itself has a whole heap o beauty and a whole heap o love, yuh know, but de people still livin in a struggle. So survival calls fuh drastic measures sometimes.\\" <br /> <br />I for one do not envision the mind of ELephant Man producing a song that is so impacting and sensible, and yet so \\"vibable\\". People might assume, because of the sing-jay, chattah nature of Damian's music, that there is no substance beneath the songs. These people either do not understand the words, or they do not understand how the Caribbean really is. <br /> <br />If you want good music, with good lyrics and a rhyming ability comparable to the old-school rappers of the early 90's, check out Damian. Dis, ma boi is de thing fuh yuh.
B000065DWH|5.0|i wasn't so familiar with randy newman's work except of \\"i love LA\\" so that when i bought that record, i found myself completely amazed by the whole thing, this is pop but this is also blues, and the way he sings the blues is quite rare, i mean the intention is really there, his spirit is totally dedicated to the blues and his melodies are so simple and full of sadness and makes you want to love and think about a whole spectrum of things, of course \\"marie\\" is incredible but my favorite is \\"guilty\\", love the lyrics too: \\"it takes a whole lotta medecine to believe that i'm somebody else\\", america should be proud of randy newman, i mean in the white musicians, i simply don't know anybody as good as him in the us. oh i mean almost cause elvis, buddy holly, jerry lee...
6305161879|5.0|This is an hilarious motion picture.  The cast is marvelous.  Jamie Lee Curtis is outstanding, as is Kevin Kline.  John Cleese does a masterful job as a stuffy, English barrister.  He also wrote the screenplay.  The plot is great and the entire movie is full of hilarious scenes.  I thoroughly enjoyed this movie.
B0009I7NNA|1.0|To be honest they didnt have a negitive rating or zero so this is the worst i could give. You see AX7 this is not really music. Before you open you mouth listen but dont listen to Avenged Sevenfold. This band is a version of the Backstreet Boys with guitars. Why do you people fool yourselves  into thinks that this racket is music or is cool for that matter. Yes I know that \\"MTV 2's HEADBANGERS BALL had them appear on there but this was only for entertaiment purposes only in other words to make fun of the silly mix matched boy band. Hey all you hardcore AX7 fans look at yourselves and say \\"Where have i gone so wrong.\\" Oh yeah DO NOT under any circumstances buy this horriable album. If you already wasted your $12.99 simply sell it to Hastings. WAIT THEY PROBLY DONT WANT THIS CRAP.
B00000AOUD|4.0|When I first heard \\"Thick as a Brick\\" it was on my local fm station, many years ago. As you can imagine, they only played the highlights. While these were just the highlights, they could not do justice to the power and majesty of the full length album version.  <br /> <br />This album is perhaps the one of the finest concept albums after The Who's \\"Tommy\\" and Emerson, Lake and Palmer's \\"Brain Salad Surgery\\" Too bad that they had to clutter it up the extra inconsequential tracks (the live short version and the interview with Ian Anderson). That is why I only gave it a four stars out of the five.
6304696566|4.0|<br />John Ford's THE SEARCHERS (1956) is considered one of the five greatest westerns of all time.  How about if we knock it down a  peg and call it merely very good or excellent?  In 1868 Texas, Cavalry officer Ethan Edwards (John Wayne at his most unsympathetic) finally returns home-only to find that Comanche Indians have kidnapped his two granddaughters and killed the younger of the two.  With son or grandson Jeffrey Hunter, Wayne goes on a ten year vendetta all over beautiful Monument Valley in search of the kidnapped Debbie (Natalie Wood, one year after REBEL WITHOUT A CAUSE).  Does he find her alive?  Dead?  Does she want to come home with a veritable stranger after years of being raised as a Comanche?  And what does Wayne do to the Comanche villain Scar?  This is a profoundly unhappy family saga. <br /> <br />Ravishingly photographed, in Technicolor and VistaVision, THE SEARCHERS is basically a bleak character study of an existential loner.  He is warmly welcomed home at the beginning as a door opens; he is left outside alone at the end as the same door closes, in a classic scene.  The film is helped by superb supporting work by some of Ford's repertory cast, especially Vera Miles, Ward Bond, and Olive Carey.  But it is done in, for me personally, by Hank Worden's bald-headed idiot Moze and by whoever plays the guitar and laughs \\"Haw, haw, haw, haw, haw.\\"  I simply can't stand either of them here.  On the other hand, Wayne has one of his finest roles and gives one of his greatest performances; he deserved an Oscar nomination.   <br /> <br />THE SEARCHERS is not one of the greatest westerns of all time for me, but it certainly is superb and one of director/producer Ford's best films of the 1950's.  And, yes, I love \\"Annie Laurie\\" over the legendary opening and closing scenes.  Just lower your expectations and expect a beautifully crafted and finely acted western downer. <br /> <br /> <br />
B000BJ7BCK|4.0|I give this one 4 stars for it's sheer fun. We saw this while visiting Denver and it turned out to be the perfect film for the adults as well as the 13 and 8 year olds. Lots of laughter and silliness. Always enjoy Kurt Russell as well. I am only suprised that more folks weren't talking about it. It felt fresh and still had a nice feel aside from all the super hero antics. <br /> <br />Others may pan it ... we were delighted.
0141439807|4.0|As many have said, this book is not Austen's most celebrated, but the main character, Fanny Price, is one of her best. Austen is a champion of the disadvantaged female and in this story, much like Bronte's Jane Eyre, Fanny, our heroine, goes to live with another family as a child and is kept from the enjoyments of others. Not to say she is misused or treated like a servant, but is prohibited from the enjoyments of her adopted familys' life. Because of her inferior birth she is no more than a bystander, watching the enjoyments of others from a distance. But, through the course of events, each of her immediate family and a few neighboring friends, come to value her each in their own way. Though not overtly accomplished like the ladies around her she is a self-made woman. It is frustrating to be the reader at times, knowing what is in Fanny's mind, especially of her desires. If she would but speak, react, defend herself we know she would be more noticed and would have more of a chance with those she wishes would notice her. What is interesting is why she doesn't make those choices. Her personal discipline and conscience are, at times, her biggest enemies. The only reason this novel fell short for me was it's ending. As per usual with Austen's heroines, they eventually get what the want, which really can be said for any of her characters. For a character like Fanny, who we've been rooting for the entire time, who we want to succeed, who we want to have the man she's wanted all her life, and who has never been able to communicate her wants or desires to anyone, the ending felt like an empty victory.  She is this sad, simple, smart, incredibly deserving woman and we can only expect that her lifetime of waiting will pay off. It does, but not as she deserves. Not to say she doesn't get exactly what she wants, but I don't feel that we get to share in her triumph.
B000B5XOXY|5.0|Having just revisited this movie this weekend in its new reissue, I can say that I liked it just as much as I had originally. Having been there almost from the beginning of Batman comics, through the 60's campy TV series (but everything was camp then), to the Tim Burton psycho series (let's face it folks, Batman Returns was terrible), Batman Forever took Batman back to comic book style - over the top villians and a Batman with a tortured soul. I love watching Tommy Lee Jones having such a good time with Two-Face (are we really going to seriously argue the character of a comic book figure?)and Jim Carrey goes over the top once more (no surprise here). Val Kilmer's Batman is more three-dimensional than Keaton's and a love interest who is a criminal psychologist is a nice twist. I like the humor - who wants reality. The new edition has a ton of extras and you get to see the actors then and now which is always fun. But if you die-hards want to see a really satisfying Batman, then hop over to Batman Begins. It's been really amazing to see each generation adapt Batman to its own needs and interests and this new one is no exception - complete with Ninja training. I think Bob Kane would get a good laugh at that one.
B00005CDUE|5.0|If you are a fan already, and own several albums, pass this by.  If you are like me and remember a few of their songs and perhaps really like one...(Love is The Drug) was one of my all time favorites way back when...then this is a very good CD to hear this band.  The evolution is fascinating to listen to.  And the fact that it is done backwards in time is interesting too...I found myslef getting bored with the glam sound of Avalon by track 3, but then started digging the stripped down sounds by track 9 and 10, then got really hooked by track 13 (reminds me of the Talking Heads...very innovative).   This sounds like the \\"history\\" of a group rather than a \\"best of\\"...I hate best of's, because my favorites aren't usually there...this one is well put together.  I've already burned it in reverse, that is an interesting way to listen to it.  Buy this if you want to hear an interesting and inventive band evolve from early 70's rock-pop to the glam-pop of the early 80's.
0446677450|1.0|This guy has been inexplicably popular for some time now, and it's not that hard to figure out why.  That classic story that Americans love to hear: the rags to riches, pull yourself up by the bootstraps type of story.  Only this guy can't seem to get his \\"story\\" straight.  He constantly takes one side of an issue, then turns around and says something to contradict himself.  Even if what he says in the book were true, why would one want to follow his advice?  He says he learned from \\"Rich Dad\\" how to make money.  This was in the 1950's and he was broke and homeless 30 years later.  So, if that great advice from \\"Rich Dad\\" made him broke, why is that good financial information for one to follow in 2005?   This type of fluff is likely to appeal to people who watch paid programming and just KNOW there's a system out there that will make them loads of cash in 30 days (wink wink). Or perhaps he's popular because he's been on Oprah (another know nothing) mesmerizing a crowd with his stories and achievements.  The bottom line here is that this book is a waste of money, everything in here that actually makes sense (precious little to be sure) is common sense to anyone in the workforce, and really, who wants to take financial advice from a guy whose net worth is 50-100 million dollars, \\"depending on the day\\"?? Think people, do you want to take financial advice from a guy who loses half his net worth in a single DAY??
B0002S947K|5.0|This is a great CD by a new and upcoming artist. Buy it!
B0000046KM|5.0|Anyone who has had past or present loves needs this CD..  Shirley takes you on  an emotional journey you will cherish always.  It is the best collection she has ever done.
B00005S6K8|4.0|Julia Ormond and Harrison Ford struggles to keep this sub-par remake alive. They--especially Julia--succeeds in bringing forth this great story. A great love story, the movie captures the evolution of savior: \\"Sabrina Fair\\" whose warmth and compassion changes the lives of everyone around her. <br /> <br />On the other hand, the romantic chemistry between Ormond and Ford leaves much to be desired, especially for a romantic film and the nouveau riche ambience is a tad over-done and detracts from the main plot. <br /> <br />However, this remains one of my favorite films and doesn't fail to be moving.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|very pleasant to listen to, easy to sing along with, good relaxing driving music...
B000006MS3|5.0|It is hard to say which of KT's albums are a favourite - they are all great and suit different paths in our lives. This album, The Dreaming, is probably KT's darkest record. Not a place for people to start in her catalogue, do that with Hounds Of Love or The Whole Story. After an appreciation is developed for her vocal quirks and simple, but highly effective, story telling should one then purchase The Dreaming. <br /> <br />The album needs to played *LOUD LOUD LOUD* and is great if you've come home from another day at work where everything... seemed..... just out of.......... reach! Learn some of the lyrics, clear a space in your lounge room and prepare to scream and dance with KT. Also great to drive with, however be prepared for odd glances from other drivers as you scream \\"Get Out Of My House!!\\"
B000002GB9|4.0|I knew what i was getting here as i own the vinyl album and was updating to cd.
B00005JKTF|5.0|I was surprised not have heard of this movie, and was even more surprised that it was not recognized by critics and movie goers alike. <br />  <br />The way the story unfolds seems erratic and non-uniform, but what can one expect from such a complex storyline in only 2 or so hours? Kate was remarkable in this film and so too was Billy Crudup. It's easy to see past any minor wardrobe flaws or any weaknesses in the unfolding of the plot, as the main focuses are the emotional and symbolic components, which were done well! <br />  <br />  An unconventinal love story, \\"Charlotte Gray\\" shows the struggles of ordinary people amidst dire circumstances. Setting love aside to fulfill what she felt were her obligations in the war, she discovers that it was in fact love that lead her to accept her role in the french communist resistance.  <br />   <br /> While searching for her lost love, she becomes attached to the characters in her 1945 French village and unwittingly ignites a new and unexpected flame. Charlotte soon finds her true nature; revealed in the challenges and struggles that she faces. In the end, the film leads into Charlotte making a seemingly unexpected choice....
B00005JNTX|3.0|This is a movie where you have to really watch the whole thing to truly appreciate it.  When I first started to watch it I was not really into it. I found it confusing and hard to follow. Basically it tells three different stories and each one starts in the middle with no real back story.  So your left to figure out what's going on. This really hampered the enjoyment of the movie for me at first. <br /> <br />Once it was over though and I set back and digested what I had just watched, I found that I really liked it. It is completely original and engaging. <br /> <br />
B00008R9KF|1.0|Seriously, I can't believe my eyes. This film has received an average vote of 4.5 out of 5!?!? I was in the cinema tonight, watching this movie at the Gay & Lesbian film festival with my boyfriend and two friends, and this was WITHOUT EXCEPTION THE WORST MOVIE I'VE EVER SEEN! Why? For the following reasons:<br /><br />1. The STORY - or lack of same - is HORRIBLE. Not just bad, but horrible. Someone should have told the author that when you write a story you need to: a) Have something on your mind that you want to tell the reader/receiver; b) have a red line in the movie that connects the scenes, persons and events; and c) reach a conclusion in the end of the story. Unfortunately, story has neither. The events are totally rambled up, the focus seems to be moved at least a dozens of times during the (all to long) length of the movie, sudden events come without any purpose, explanation or, worst of all, point.<br /><br />2. The ACTING is INCREDIBLY LOUSY. Nothing really more to be said. Daniell Day Lewis looks nice, but the acting is just so incredibly amateur-like that I couldn't believe it.<br /><br />3. The DIALOGUE is Awful. There was one - ONE - line in the whole<br /><br />movie that actually worked (when the uncle says \\"I'm a professional businessman, not a professional Pakisthani.\\" The rest just screams 'I'm an 11 year old trying to write a screenplay'.<br /><br />4. The CUTTING is - I'm running out of bad words hear, so I'll just stick to horrible, cause that pretty much sums it up. When the cutting is done well you won't really notice it, but in this movie the cutting is done in all the wrong places - either too soon or too late.<br /><br />On the bottom line, you might think: There might be some redeeming qualities, there must be something good to say about this movie. But there's not. Sorry. But I have nothing good to say. It just downright horrible. And no, I'm not homophobic since I'm gay, so pleasy don't bring that one up.<br /><br />1 out of 5. That's aminimum. Would give 0 if I could. Avoid at all cost.

0151008116|4.0|As Laura Kaplan aptly points out, Martel is clearly well versed in kabbalah, the venerable Jewish mystical tradition, and this tradition plays a role in the book that deserves further thought and exploration.<br /><br />The vessel's name, \\"Tzimtzum,\\" does not even sound authentically Japanese. And it is not. As Kaplan says, it is a Hebrew kabbalistic term that refers to the intentional contraction of the Divine in the world that made creation possible. The doctrine of tzimtzum is associated with the thoughts of Rabbi Isaac Luria, the highly influential 16th-century kabbalist who made headlines recently when Madonna dedicated a song on her latest album to him. In fact, Rabbi Luria is mentioned at the very beginning of \\"Life of Pi.\\"<br /><br />I am not an expert on the Lurianic kabbalah, but as a reader, I can suggest that these are not coincidences. I agree with Kaplan that creation is a key theme of this book and I believe that additional thought and study of this issue will be rewarding.<br /><br />I would have given the book the highest rating if the mystical themes had been developed in a way that, however subtle, was also clearer to the educated general reader.
B000002BE9|2.0|\\"Sleep To Dream\\" and \\"Criminal\\" are musically superb.  The remainder of the album is filler.
B000003TA4|5.0|This is it, the masterpiece that changed popular music. No other album in history of music is truyl as genre defining as Nevermind. Not only is it the most influential rock album ever, but it's the greatest musical statement of the 20th century. Nevermind captured a nerve that's been LOST in ROCK N ROLL for a LONG time. NEVERMIND is definitly ROCK music at ITS BEST and most infectious.
B0000255CL|5.0|Immortal's ridiculously fast approach to their special frostbitten brand of black metal gets a slight overhaul on this album. the production becomes a bit more crystalized and the tunes get a bit more melodic. the pace has slowed down a bit with a focus more on a mid paced thrashy kind of groove that suits them well. the same lyrical themes are present as on past records: epic battles atop frozen mountaintops and tributes to the fictional kingdom of Blashyrkh adorn these songs. but which icy warlord approved this particular photo session? oh my. heehee...no matter, a small misstep (albeit a hilarious one) that only adds a whole new level of fun to this album. At The Heart Of Winter may not appeal to the diehard Immortal fans who think that they are no good without the non-stop blur of blast beats; but for those who like a bit of melody with their grim blackened metal should not hesitate inspecting this colossal masterpiece.
B0000AQVCL|5.0|I hate this style of modern music. I'm not such a big fan of modern music. Its boring, has no meaning, but there are some exceptions. I think that this band is one of them. There are so many other bands that play this 1969, 70s era music, but this band shines. They rock hard when they need to, and can bring it down and write meaningful lyrics, too. Jet is not a 'White Stripes', 'The vines', or 'The Hives' knockoffs, they are themselves in a way. I really liked all the catchyness of the songs, and the piani is some of the tracks mix things up a bit. <br />All in all, this album is a good buy for all you garage-punk, 'reto' rockers out there.
079073804X|5.0|William Peter Blatty's novel was the screenplay for this superb film.  William Friedkin's direction moves this film beyond any other film since and after.  5 STARS to this exquisite film.<br /><br />Drama<br /><br />Superb Acting<br /><br />Good v/s Evil<br /><br />This film is beyond the horror genre,  it is it's own genre.  The only ONE film.
B000002KIE|1.0|The Sex Pistols were a subpar punk/pop band. End of Story. Unfortuantly the media has hyped this album claiming it is \\"The Essential Punk Album\\", and the sex pistols fooled everyone by thinking that they were a rebelieous band. If you want some good Punk/Rock music, buy \\"London Calling\\", that's a real punk masterpiece.
0805066691|5.0|Well here are my 2 cents on this book. I own one and I love the book, cos it speaks the truth! It shows the reality how the White Man treated the indians. Some chapters was so horrible when they described the horror the native americans had to hold out that it made me cry and I just had to put the book away for a few days, before I could go on with reading it, cos I pictured that horror the native americans had to endure, I did put myself into their shoes and did suffer with them. I lived and died with them too. My heart goes out to ALL native american indians. I only can recommend this book to those who loves the truth and want to hear the truth. This book is just heartbreaking and be prepared to cry a lot of tears. You will ask yourself lots of questions and they will always begin with the word: \\"WHY.....\\" Its 100% worth to be read and should be read by everybody, then you will discover the biggest shame of the United States - committed crimes against a people who was there first.
B0006L16N8|3.0|my god coldplay, how can you dissapoint me like this? I am a hardcore fan of coldplay and i have been since i was 12. Their first 2 albums, parachutes and AROBTTH were amazing, mellow, beautiful, meaningful lyrics,natural instruments-everything i could hope for. it was something fresh, something different besides all that radio friendly crap thats out there now. people had problems with the band and wanted them to become more radio friendly-so due to pressure Chris and the band made their next album x&y radio friendly, overly pop-y, with aritificial studio sounds dominating every song, meaningless, dumb lyrics-and most of its songs are a ripoff of their other songs(take speed of sound for example, it is exactly clocks with a different title) look, dont get me wrong,i love coldplay, but i think this album is the opposite of what coldplay stands for. what have they turned into? U2? backstreet boys? THOSE BANDS SUCK AND COLDPLAY IS SUPPOSED TO BE DIFFERENT! why cant they just keep their old style? WHAT HAS HAPPENED TO THE MUSIC INDUSTRY? I give this album 3 stars because of a couple good songs like \\"A message\\" and 'Swallowed in the sea\\" and because his voice is still beautiful despite their changed album. <br />Coldplay's old music touched and inspired me, and now it sounds like some overproduced U2 radio crap. please Coldplay, come back for gods sake. we dont need anymoreGreenday and MatchBox 20. I sincerely hope Coldplay does not continue to dissapoint their real fans, and i hope their next album returns to their orginal style and they dont become a total sell-out. sorry coldplay, you just dont cut it this time, although i will continue to enjoy your other high quality music.
B00005JO0J|4.0|I guess that this is a love it or hate it franchise. Me, I LOVE it!!! I think that 9 out of 10 non-firefly fans seeing this film will like it, and of those, maybe half will be compelled to see the series DVD--and then they too will join the order of the Browncoats. But, there will always be dissenters. The movie is atypical--the dialogue and the plot developments fly past like bullets and if you aren't paying attention, the movie could go over your head. However, it is such a unique spin on the genre(s) with such charismatic characters that it is well worth it to give it a try. I give it four stars only because I did feel that it could have been fleshed out a bit more for non-FF fans. <br /> <br />The reason why people--everyday, educated, sociable, male and female adult people--fall in love with the Firefly universe is that it speaks to rebel, funlover and fighter in us. This is a story of down-in-the-dirt, deeply flawed characters who nonetheless rise to meet every challenge, who inspire us and make us laugh at the same time. Rent or buy \\"Firefly\\".  Then you'll understand the zealous fervor behind \\"Serenity\\".
0307276902|5.0|I could not put this book down! I have had an interest in addiction and recovery for as long as I can remember and have read many books about it. This one is different- you can FEEL what this man went through- in your guts. I think I finished it in 3 nights.  <br />A must read.
0596009208|5.0|I left Java development back when the 1.3 version of the SDK was being eagerly awaited.  On return I looked for a way to review past knowledge and get up to speed with new features.  Head First Java was a fun way to do both.  It is not a comprehensive reference resource, it's an engaging learning model that provides you with a solid conceptual and practiced foundation for digging deeper on your own.  It moves a little fast for someone completely new to programming.
B000AARKO4|5.0|I knew absolutely nothing about this movie before I saw it. The mere fact that Blockbuster had a full shelf stocked with it, and the first two weeks after it came out that shelf was empty, indicated the movie was probably good. But still I didn't think that Orlando Bloom could carry a whole movie. His pretty-boy looks and thin body put him in the category of a lover, not a figher. And this is a movie about fighting. <br />&lt;h2>THE STORY&lt;/h2> <br />Kingdom of Heaven is generally about the conflict between the Cristians and the Muslims fighting over Jerusalem around the 1100s. Balian receives a surprise visit from a Crusader, Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin, who comes to tell him he is his father. He asks him to join him on his trip to Jerusalem where he will have an occupation and can receive forgiveness for his sins and that of his wife. At first, he refuses. He has just buried his wife, who killed herself when their child died. A priest says the wrong thing to him about his wife, whose cross he stole, and he kills him. Oops! Time to get out of town!Balian catches up with his father. The authorities come after Balian, and end up in a battle with Godfrey and his Crusaders. Godfrey never makes it to Jerusalem but makes Balian a knight. Balian ends up in Jerusalem only to find the Cristians on the verge of war with the Muslims led by Saladin, who has an army of 200,000. He also finds that God doesn't speak to him in Jerusalem. <br /> <br />The rest of the movie centers around mounting tensions between the Saladin whose army is certain to be able to conquer the Christians who now occupy Jerusalem. The King of Jerusalem had a peace pact with Saladin, and once the King dies of leprosy, his sister Sibylla and her husband Guy de Lusignan, become queen. The King, who always wanted a war, issues an attack on the Muslims. As a result the peace between Muslism and Christians is now over. The Christians days in Jerusalem are now numbered. But ultimately this is not a movie with asad ending. <br /> <br />&lt;h2>THE TRUTH&lt;/h2> <br />Besides the fact that this is an excellent movie for many reasons, what I like is the fact that much of it is based on historical facts. As an anthropology major, I love movies that are based on true stories. There was in fact a Princess Sibylla, sister to the King of Jerusalem, who did die of leprosy. And she was married to a war-mongering Guy de Lusignan. They did become King and Queen of Jerusalem. When King Guy's knights lost the battle, he was spared by Saladin because he was a king.  <br /> <br />Although his men were responsible for murdering many Christians, Saladin did, in fact, have a reputation for being merciful. Balian of Ibelin was responsible for convincing Saladin to allow the Christians to leave Jerusalem safely. The part that is left out is Balian had to pay a ransom for everyone. Balian did not marry Sibylla, however, because he was already married. Much of the story about Balian is fictionalized, but the most important part, his role in negotiating safe passage of the Christians out of Jerusalem, is by all accounts true. <br />&lt;h2>PERFORMANCES&lt;/h2> <br />Excellent performances were given by Orlando Bloom as Balian, Liam Neeson as Godfrey, Baron of Ibelin, Marton Csokas as Guy de Lusignan, Brendan Gleeson, Jeremy Irons, Edward Norton as the leper King Baldwin, to name a few. <br />&lt;h2>CRITICISMS&lt;/H2> <br />Criticisms I have:  <br />&lt;ol> <br />&lt;li>Middle eastern actors had very poorly developed characters.  <br />&lt;li>Subtitles did not translate any of the arabic lines. (What's up with that?!) <br />&lt;li>I have difficulty finding the real names of the middle eastern actors in this movie despite their great performances. &lt;/li>&lt;/ol> <br />What I like is that Arabic people were not portrayed as crazed religious fanatics, as they are in 99% of American movies. Hollywood is great at stereotyping non-Europeans, and I am sick of seeing Arabic people always villainized. Villains come in all colors in real life. This is movie is a breath of fresh air in that respect. Kudos to Ridley Scott! <br /> <br />Now back to my next question: Can Orlando Bloom carry a whole movie? To my surprise, he did fine--but he didn't have to. There are enough strong characters, great performances, memorable lines, and an excellent story line to support the movie.
B000AADYYO|5.0|Exactly as the title states. Outstanding album. It took me a few times listening to Ghost Reveries to actually warm up to the rest of the album after only listening to Ghost of Perdition and Reverie/Harlequin Forest over and over; eventually I came to my senses. This entire album from the 1st song to the last song is a work of pure art. No band out there has the sound, the feeling, or the musical talent Opeth has. If you were a fan of Deliverance or Still Life, be prepared to have a new favorite album!
B0000AQVCL|3.0|This is the 2003 release by the Australian rock band 'Jet' with their album 'Get Born'. Unfortunately, there are only 2 appreciable decent songs on this album and they are 'Are You Gonna Be My Girl' and 'Cold Hard Bitch', the rest of the tracks are below par and unoriginal. To the listener of rock like me, this album ran out of material 3 or 4 songs in and relied on banking off repackaged material, they took songs from AC/DC and incorporated sounds from Powderfinger.<br /><br />'Are You Gonna Be My Girl', shot Jet into the spotlight and if it wasn't for that song, Jet would have been another struggling band trying to survive. This Aussie group has alot of improvement to work on before they deserve the success they achieved with their first album. 3 stars are given for the two songs I mentioned and only that.
B000000HHE|5.0|This is one of the absoulte best Rap albums I have heard in my entire life. It is a taste of the old school, without the gangster Rap. De La Soul is one of the most influential and soft but sweet Rap groups of all time. This album was made before I was even born, 1989 to be precise, and is still being bought 16 years later. That is the power of this cd. You could go to a store and have your parents look at this album and go \\"Oh I remember when this album came out\\". You could share this album with your little sister, older brother, Mom, Dad, or even your grandparents. This has only God knows how many singles on it, and each so individual in it's beats and slow rhymes. Here are the top 5 songs on the album.    5. Say No Go- I haven't heard this song yet, but I have heard alot about it, and seems like one of their greatest hits ever.    4. The Magic Number- This song has apeared in many games, and commercials, and is A very catchy song and beat, and is one of my favorites on the entire album.    3. Buddy- This song features fellow stars The Jungle Brothers and Q-Tip from A Tribe Called Quest, who are some of the best rappers of their time. This is probably the most played song on the album, and most famous. I liked it when I heard it but not as much as the 2 that are about to come.    2. D.A.I.S.Y. Age- The beginning beat is the same as in the song \\"Microphone Fiend\\" by Eric B. and Rakim, which may I remind you is one of the hottest beats... EVER! The lyrics really make this song.    1. Me, Myself, and I- And the winner is \\"Me Myslef, and I\\". This has the best lyrics, beats, and is one of the most interesting songs ever. I absolutely love this song, and I recommend this entire album to anyone who likes Rap.    De La Soul is one of the most unique groups that ever performed, and had one of the most important albums period. It has beautiful beats and lyrics, and is unbelieveably special to the world of Rap. Here are some of the things that make this album so great:    3.It has so many singles and hit songs that you can't resist buying this album.    2. The greatest album of one of the greatest music groups ever. No one could ever top this album while still making the same kind of music.    1. For $13.99, you might pick up an okay album, but to get this deal for 14 bucks! Come on people, when will you ever get another deal like this. Not to mention there is 24 tracks on it, and the bonus cd!
B00005JLKB|5.0|Superman...that's aname everyone knows.  Clark Kent...ditto.  But do we really know why Clark kent and Superman are such household names.  Well here comes a new telling on why we know these names.  Smallville is a TV show that explores the origin of Superman as the young Clark kent.  This season is exceptionally well.  The episodes are all good, but some are better than others.  Pilot, X-Ray, Hourglass, Rogue, Leech, Zero, Nicodemus, Stray, Obscura, and Tempest are all great episodes.  The others are good also because they give insight into the story of Clark to Superman.  A MUST buy if you love great television.
B0000028RR|5.0|Rage Against The Machine (1992.), Rage Against The Machine's first studio album<br /><br />The early 1990's were an exciting and innovative time for music. One of the most important examples of this was the coming of Rage Against The Machine's self titled debut; with a completely new sound which took the music world by storm. The new sound was that which combined rap and metal, in some ways in the vein of the Red Hot Chili Peppers, but much heavier and politically (with the lyrics) driven. Rage Against The Machine were one of the most popular bands of the 90's and many of their fans hail the debut effort as their finest. So, does the album live up to the high respect and popularity it has been given over the past decade?<br /><br />I originally became interested in getting hold of some RATM albums after buying and quite liking Audioslave's self titled 2002 debut album. Liking what were the riffs and melodies produced by the three remaining members of RATM in Audioslave, I decided to buy their 1992 debut album. I was totally taken aback by this album from the first listen. RATM on their debut are the ultimate musical powerhouse; a force to be reckoned with. The unique fusion of the classic, fast, metal riffs of Morello's guitar coupled with the charged, aggressive and politically orientated rapping of Zack de la Rocha and the assured beat drummed by Brad Wilk and the bass lines played by Y. timK was a sound I'd never heard before. RATM are at their rawest and most powerful on this album and thats what for me makes their debut stand out over their later 3 albums. The later albums are excellent but at the same time are more packaged, produced and complex. RATM's debut has your attention throughout; the riffs for the most part are awesome; the album still sounds fresh; it hasn't dated at all in the past 13 years. The music the band produce have nods the music of Led Zeppelin, 80's metal and the rap/rock style of RCHP in this album, but it is influences well used to create one of the most original albums of the last 20 years. Zack de la Rocha is clearly a man with a massive political agenda, focusing on racial prejudice in society and the hypocritical nature of politians in the developed world. RATM were also a band which were excellent at playing out quieter moments in their songs, building a climax and then pounding out their aggression. They manage it many times on this album; 'Fistful of Steel' and 'Settle For Nothing' are songs which quickly spring to mind. Another thing which is unique about this band is that they produce all the sounds just using vocals, bass, guitar and drum - no extra instruments or fillers. Its quite hard to believe with some of the sounds on this album, and later releases by the band but its a true fact. This album is not for the weak minded, its aggression and ferocity can easily blow you away - Anger is a gift indeed.<br /><br />RATM's classic debut album begins with 'Bombtrack'. A descending, nifty bass line climaxes into a pounding guitar sequence and commanding vocals from Zack de la Rocha - RATM are in full flow from the start. 'Killing In The Name' is the classic; one of the songs of the 90's. A weirdish start builds into a timeless riff from Morello's guitar. Where Zack de la Rocha sings 'Now you do what they told ye' is classic RATM; you can sense the energy building in the song, with some nifty guitar work, before it builds into a pounding chorus; what a song! Next is 'Take The Power Back', a funky bass line opens this song with some quirky guitar work. Another classic chorus on this song and a classic, uncompromising riff; another awesome song. The next song is one of the more intelligent works on the album, 'Settle For Nothing'. Zack de la Rocha story tells the opening verse, over some moaning guitar play before building into another charged up verse. Throughout the song there is innovative guitar play and plenty of powerful lines such as when de la Rocha shouts 'I'm caught between my cultureand the system' - his views on society are vented in a very focused manner on this song. 'Bullet In The Head' come next. Another awesome bass line starts this song and some of the screeching guitar play is phenominal - another strong chorus on this song.<br /><br />So, awesome so far - we're not finished yet, this album doesn't let up and drop in quality one bit. 'Know Your Enemy'; clever scrambled guitar opening before breaking into another classic riff. The song has a great mix of power and subtlety - the repeated calling of 'All of which are American Dreams' at the end of the song leaves its mark memorably, where de la Rocha questions hypocrisy in society. Nods to Led Zep come in track 7, courtesy of a Kashmir style opening. 'Wake Up' adopts this perfectly, Morello blends the opening riff into one of his own and Zack de la Rocha proceeds to vent his anger on the mistakes politicians on foreign policy; another powerfully focused song. 'Fistful Of Steel' is classic RATM and 'Township Rebellion' where de la Rocha raps subtlely over a rolling bass line, before we have more pounding riffs. Finally, just to add further excellence to this album, we have the closing track, 'Freedom', a 6-minute epic. The guitar sequences are varied and some of the sections with just drum and bass are tense; you almost feel the energy building up before another bursting guitar section. An amazing finish to a timeless album.<br /><br />I can't praise this album enough, its up there with other definitive 90's albums such as Pearl Jam's 'Ten', Alice In Chains' 'Dirt' and Radiohead's 'OK Computer'. RATM had their finest hour with their debut album; its pure raw genius. Later albums are great but don't quite get to the levels of this album and neither does the Chris Cornell fronted Audioslave (the latter being a good band though I don't think the RATM style is totally suited with Cornell's voice). RATM's first album is a must own; a definitive metal album for your collection. Buy this album, you can't settle for nothing less!ulture and the system' - his views on society are vented in a very focused manner on this song. 'Bullet In The Head' come next.

B000067CPX|5.0|From the moment you put on this CD you're hooked.  The opening rocker (title track) is wonderful and amazing.  Then you move on to the poppy, nice poppy but still poppy, Universally Speaking.  The CD doesn't let down there.  This Is The Place is always wonderful to hear and Dosed is an exceptional ballad.  Don't Forget Me is almost untouchable and then comes the two singles.  The album is great.  Midnight is another classic that everyone should hear.  Tear, in the spirit of the Beach Boys, is heartbreaking and wonderful.  Then the album closes with the hip hop rocker Minor Thing, and two of my favorites on the CD: Warm Tape (shiver for me girl) and Venice Queen. <br /> <br />If you want a strong album that has a consistent sound buy this.  You won't be disappaointed.
B00005JNBQ|4.0|I find this movie gets funnier every time I watch it (and I've watched it a few times).  Someone mentioned that Pedro doesn't smile until the end of the movie, but thinking about it I don't think many of the characters do. <br /> <br />People like what they like, and I guess you need to have a warped sense of humor, an appreciation for corny comedy, or a love for geeks to appreciate this film.  I'd watch it again (and I'm about to add it to my DVD collection).
B00005JNJV|5.0|After a foiled attempt at avenging the deaths of his parents by a common street thug and a run-in with Gotham City's crime boss, rich kid Bruce Wayne (Christian Bale) realizes that he knows very little of the injustice and evil that adorns the world like a plague. He grew up a rich snot-nosed kid, but his father always told him to protect the less privelaged. But Bruce decides that he needs to study those who take advantage of the weak, and so becomes a criminal himself in order to further his study. While in an Asian prison, he is visited by a mysterious man named Ducard (Liam Neeson) who is a member of the League of Shadows, an organization dedicated to stamping out evil and corruption wherever it can be found, even if it means destroying Gotham City to further their ends! Bruce, in the guise of Batman must return to his home to save his city from tearing itself apart and rein in the criminal elements that rule the streets.  <br /> <br />Batman Begins is a modern classic with beautiful shots reminiscent of Kurosawa that George Lucas would envy. When I saw it at the movies, I knew the director was doing a 180 degree turn from previous installments by concentrating on the characters, almost making it a domestic drama that just happens to be a superhero movie by accident. I thought then that maybe he took things TOO slow, but after seeing it on DVD on a small-screen I was more impressed. This is a very personal film and relies a lot on old style acting. And by that I mean Bale actually ACTS. He shows emotion and nuance in his performance. A good example is when he runs into Katie Holmes, his old love, for the first time in years in his guise of drunk playboy Bruce Wayne and you can just feel how much he wants to explain himself, but is hampered by his secret identity. Or a scene where Alfred (Michael Caine) tries to comfort Bruce Wayne as a young kid after his parent's deaths. The actors and actress were very good at relaying their character's inner lives with the lost art of close ups and the director's use of reaction shots. The other great thing that Bale does in this film is make Batman scary for the first time. Of course, if you know Bale's work from American Psycho you know he can play the unhinged really well as he murdered people to theses on Huey Lewis and Whitney Houston and here he seems tough as nails and unforgiving but his Batman never slips to murder as a means to an end. As for the look of the film, it was very similar to the first Batman and Blade Runner, but I guess there hasn't been much advancement in the field of set design when it comes to slightly futuristic cities in decline. Batman Begins feels more like a film from the 40s or 50s when movies truly mattered and is the better for it.  <br /> <br />I would highly recommend buying the Deluxe Version for a little more money, since there are absolutely ZERO extras included on this version.
B000AV2G3I|4.0|I don't think it's the \\"definative\\" Lennon package. I would have loved to see, \\"It's so Hard\\" and and \\"Going Down on Love\\" and John's version of \\"Everyman has a Woman.\\" I'd replace \\"Scared\\" and \\"Nobody Loves You\\" with \\"Here We Go Again\\" and \\"Meat City.\\"  She's done a good job with remastering the rest of John's catalog. But I do think that DVD of Lennon videos that came out be re-released to the original Lennon Collection counterpart that came out years ago...
B000A88F22|3.0|Ok so far all I've seen people do on here is complain about this DVD...So I went out and bought it for myself, and frankly I wasnt dissapointed...Im mean sure its not the best show that was ever written or anything, but it is what it claims to be: Britney and Kevin running around during her tour with handheld video cameras having a good time! Im sorry but when I get to see one of my favorite celebrities sticking her head out the tour bus window and shouting \\"Scrotum!\\" to passerbys, or walking around filming herself qeustioning people about their favorite sexual positions, then I am quite amused...Not to mention the bonus cd who for people like me (have to have every song released lol) will love...The 3 track EP featuring the songs \\"Chaotic\\", \\"Mona Lisa\\", and the current single \\" Someday (I Will Understand)\\" is an added bonus! Dont go buying this DVD/CD set if you are looking for something deep or thought out, but frankly if you wanna see Britney make a fool of herself like all of us do then go ahead!
B00000DFSK|4.0|A must have for any fan of U2.  This timeless band has consistently put out great music over the years and on this disc you can capture all of their earlier hits.  Great album for those looking to add U2 to their collection.
B000AU9UYM|5.0|You'll find many concise summaries of the film's details on this site, so I won't repeat them; what I will say is, FIVE STARS JUST FOR THE EDITING!  Director Nolan and his team have adopted a swift-as-thought, \\"through-composed\\" style of editing that skips and leaps like a mountain goat, in quick lightning-flashes from one thought to another, often as if in a dream... which is highly appropriate to the tone of the film they made. It's a joy to watch.  Bravo.   <br /> <br />The movie has tons of things to recommend it (and it's got a superb turn from the always-welcome MICHAEL CAINE!).  The filmmakers have made many sharp choices that cause it to stand out boldly from the normal run of big-budget concept/action movies (their story structuring, production design, casting choices: all are admirably unusual, but not weird -- which when taken all-together creates an environment of freshness and unpredictability: a tough feat when you consider how well-worn the story is!) By the last reel, the movie starts to sag under the sheer weight of all the plot points that need resolution, and this is when it's at its least fresh; but no matter.  It's a wonder anybody could take a hot, high-stakes property like this, and manage to make it new.  (Personally I think it's the only truly good Batman movie -- never really thought even the Tim Burton original mined the richness of the material properly.) <br /> <br />But at the end of the day, it's all about the editing, man.  Check out that amazing editing.  Study it.  Live it.  Love it. <br /> <br />
0452282152|3.0|it was an easy read but not a thrilling story but yet it gives a book group many things to ponder
B00005JN2Z|2.0|From a craft point of view, of course, the film is superb: Cruise and Foxx give tight performances, and Michael Mann can direct stylish action set-pieces in his sleep.  Everyone involved in this project is at the peak of their powers.  So the question becomes, Why didn't they know better?    I really loved Mann's \\"Heat,\\" so it breaks my heart to have to point out that this film is mostly nonsense.  Maybe it's because the story, though at least engrossing on the surface level, lacks enough internal resonance to generate anything like 'meaning' or 'importance.'  Instead, as so often in American culture, importance is supposed to be implicitly assumed because people are waving guns around.    Cruise, in his always polished and convincing manner, nevertheless spouts a lot of fake philosophical hooey about the cosmos and self-actualization, and we're supposed to listen seriously because (ready for this, folks?) he's a hit man (oooh), and he's got a gun (oh my).  Jamie Foxx's character can't live up to who he wants to be, until he finds the inner strength to (get this) fire a gun.  As in so much hip-hop music, simply waving a piece around is expected to absolve the speaker of being silly or shallow.  Maybe that's just life, but I suspect that it isn't: the power to kill may be menacing, but as Christ pointed out to Pilate, it isn't really 'power' at all.  Pity no one in this film notices.    It's a shame, because there's enough brains and talent in this movie to levitate the Pentagon.  If you want an agreeable little thriller, I suppose it's a good job, except for some disappointing lapses of story logic, and a few let-downs when you're led to believe something cool and clever is about to happen, and instead, you get more waving around of guns.  I'm not an activist on the subject, I just like a bit of artistic insight along with my grand-opera silliness; and I feel cheated when an artist excuses shallowness, or covers it over, with the glamor of violence, and nothing else.  Oh well.  They've all done enough stellar work that we can let them slide on this one.  Try a bit harder next time, guys, and I bet you make a masterpiece.
B0002DB50E|5.0|\\"Videodrome\\" is Cronenberg's greatest cinematic triumph, taking the philosophy of TV-critic Marshall McLuhan (who contended \\"the Medium is the Message\\") to the next level, where if the Medium is the Message, then the Message in the jaded, faded, infected world of \\"Videodrome\\" has devoured the messenger and is roaming around looking for fresh meat---or Flesh.<br /><br />\\"Videodrome\\" is evolutionary. It is radical. It is revolutionary. And if you've seen it, it is probably rewiring your brain even as you innocently read this review. Sucker!<br /><br />Cronenberg is a revolutionary: \\"Videodrome\\" is a chronicle of the means by which the media assumes the role of both human Id and subconscious: to nasty effect. And nasty is right: Videodrome eats the human Id and serves it up in hardy seconds and thirds. Max Renn(the inimitable James Woods) sees the sado-masochistic \\"Videodrome\\" as a tool to boost ratings for his Canadian independent film channel, not knowing that it also uses its broadcasting ability to reconfigure the human brain towards cruelty, torture, rape, dissection, perversion, and ultimately assassination.<br /><br />The acting is all detached and lab-sterile perfect, but you knew that already: James Woods is seamy, desultory, wicked, precise. Deborah Harry was born for this role. Sonja Smits (Bianca O'Blivion)is a touch tedious, but looks good and does what she has to do; Peter Dvorsky lets the nervous tics do the acting, Les Carlson (Barry Convex) is a study in creepy corporate plasticity, and Jack Creley chews scenery as the reclusive Brian O'Blivion, who refuses to deal with anyone directly and sends all his interviews out as pre-recorded videotapes. Choose your format, Beta or VHS?<br /><br />\\"Videodrome\\" bumps and grinds to perfection because Captain Cronenberg---always a visionary cartographer of the boundaries between the mind, the flesh, the Id, and high technology---knows where he wants to take it; Director of Photography Mark Irwin is a superb first mate, steering a wide range of visual images from the realm of banality and commonplace to the outlandish, freakish and bizarre in a heartbeat. Is Renn hallucinating? Does he have a brain tumor? Is that pulsating, fleshy, blood-red and vibrating \\"videotape\\" really pulsating, and is Renn really inserting it into his stomach?<br /><br />Look at the scene transitions, particularly the seamless shift from bedroom to torture chamber. Reality is indistinguishable from Media. Soon our unenviable Mr.Renn illustrates an entirely new meaning of \\"Plug and Play\\".<br /><br />To remain silent on this sumptuous Criterion Collection release would be criminal. The transfer is clean and crisp, which is precisely what you want in a flick where Deborah Harry's lips get plastered across the telescreen. Cronenberg's commentaries are always intriguing, chiefly because he knows to fill in a few gaps with nuggets of information (like telling us that one of the Japanese porn producers in the film later went on to become Canada's Minister of Culture---ehehehe) but leaves the larger mysteries untouched. Bravo!<br /><br />There's even a creepy little modern short film by Cronenberg called \\"Camera\\" with the inimitable Les Carlson, which is unrelated to \\"Videodrome\\" but nonetheless ties nicely into the theme of televised reality. Best of all, this tasty special edition is served up like an old VHS Cassette with \\"Videodrome\\" 'hand-written' in marker on the side. Sweet.<br /><br />In the final analysis, \\"Videodrome\\" is a film 20 years before its time. We now wrestle every day with the issue of TV and meaning, and typically we lose. For Cronenberg, certainly \\"Videodrome\\" was a caustic, wicked commentary on media and consumer culture, but coming hard on the heels of Timoth Leary's drug culture (doesn't \\"Tune in, Turn on, and Drop Out\\" fit in the world of \\"Videodrome\\"? Or in our own, for that matter?) I don't think that's all there is to it. I think it's more like---Prophecy.<br /><br />Play. Pause. Replay. Rewind. Play.<br /><br />Die.<br /><br />JSG<br /> <br />Play. Pause. Replay. Rewind. Play.  <br /> <br />Die. <br /> <br />JSG <br />
B000AARKOO|4.0|Other reviewers have written much about Kingdom of Heaven and the historical inaccuracies within it.  I guess there is a temptation to do so when actual historical characters are used in a fictionalized account of an event, as Ridley Scott did here regarding the period between the Second and Third Crusades in the Holy Land.  When the movie first came out to the theaters, I went to see it for two reasons; first, my interest in the Crusades as history and second, Ridley Scott's body of work and reputation as a director.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the movie in spite of the historical inaccuracies regarding the characters.  I feel it is the definitive film about the Crusades.  Several issues were portrayed well, including:<br /><br />·The tension between the descendants of the Crusaders from the First Crusade who lived in the Middle East for several generations and the relative newcomers.<br /><br />·The reputation of Saladin as one of the more humane warriors of his time.<br /><br />·The overall scale of siege warfare in medieval times, as depicted in the battle for Jerusalem.<br /><br />I found the key to enjoyment of the film is to view it as entertainment, not as a documentary, which the director never intended.  Kingdom of Heaven succeeded on that level.  I recently viewed the DVD and found to be equally as entertaining as it was in the movies.  I have read that quite a few scenes were left on the cutting room floor, and I would like to see a Director's Cut version of the DVD, particularly if the deleted scenes add to the overall flow of the film, as well as improved character development.<br /><br />All in all, however, I found Kingdom of Heaven to be a highly entertaining historical epic, and I recommend it to any viewers who enjoy this category of film.
B0007Y08I8|4.0|I made a huge parenting mistake this weekend and allowed my kids to watch this movie before watching it myself.  I thought, \\"it's a puppet movie, how bad can it be?\\"  That puppet sex scene was over the top.  I don't mind my kids watching some sexual content in movies, but that was just too much for younger kids (pre-teen and younger).  So PARENTS BEWARE! <br /> <br />Otherwise, it was a hilarious movie!  As an adult, I enjoyed all the shots at the actors and other world leaders.
B0000VCZKW|2.0|Is this really a movie for children?  I don't know. <br /> <br />The school principal throws a boy out the window and it's a comedy.  Pretty scary for kids who suffer abuse. <br /> <br />Towards the end of the movie the kids pelt the principal with paint and other school supplies to drive her away.  True, she's an ogre, but whatever happened to non-violent ways of getting rid of nasty folks?   <br /> <br />Then the lead girl asks her parents to give her up for adoption, which they do with nary a hesitation.  Yikes-a-doodle. <br /> <br />As with most Hollywood flicks, this one is short on character development, semi-long on plot, and super long on technical gizmos.  It appears to be \\"liberal\\" but with such small-mindedness it's not very open at all.  And the main characters are exclusively white, while Black kids sit in the back of the bus. <br /> <br />Choose \\"The Story of the Weeping Camel\\" instead.
B000026GGE|3.0|Phil Collins' debut album title says everything about the approach to this LP.  This album begins with \\"In The Air Tonight\\" with its quiet, night time feel until nearly the end when the other instruments emerge from the darkness.  Baring feeling over subtle tones on \\"This Must Be Love\\" gives a sense of authenticity.  \\"The Roof Is Leaking\\" is a tale of despair and struggling with everyday life.  \\"Droned\\" is an intense instrumental that has some sort of story to fit somewhere in-between.  To add to the feeling of love \\"You Know What I Mean\\" has the effects of motion picture song all over it.  On to a more up step \\"Thunder And Lighting\\", it is laced with a horn section to get you up.  And the most heartfelt and sorrow drowned song, \\"If Leaving Me Is Easy\\", is about his real life story of his wife leaving while he was on tour.  Maybe she should have listened to this as much as I have and had a change of heart.  This is the beginning of what Phil had to offer and its well worth checking out.

B000AADYYO|5.0|Bought this cd with no knowledge of this band whatsoever. After one listen it became one of my favorite albums. After many listens it became my favorite album. THe only way to truly appreciate this album is in a dark room with the volume WAY up. Every track is great, so it would be hard to figure out which ones were my favorite. I guess I could say that Ghost of Perdition was my first favorite, but it's the first one I heard. Not one bad song on here. I also bought Orchid a few days later and plan on picking up the rest of their catalog. Definitely won't regret buying this cd.

B00005Q4CS|4.0|\\"No middle ground here: you'll either love or hate `Requiem for a Dream,'\\" the dust cover publicity reads. I beg to differ: I admired the film for its intensity, its fine if unorthodox craftsmanship, and its superb performances, but I found it so harrowing and depressing that I can't imagine how anyone could ever love it. Director Darren Aronofsky, writing the screenplay with Hubert Selby Jr. from Selby's novel, strives to recreate the subjective experience of a junkie's addiction, to an extent even films such as \\"Drugstore Cowboy\\" failed to do. Working with cinematographer Matthew Libatique, editor Jay Rabinowitz and sound man Brian Emmerich, Aronofsky assaults us with the sensory experience of addiction, as experienced by four pathetic losers: junkie Harry Goldfarb (Jared Leto), his girlfriend Marion (Jennifer Connelly), best friend Tyrone (Marlon Wayans) and speed freak mother Sarah (Ellen Burstyn). Each becomes the perfect, and perfectly horrible, example of the different private hells that junkies fall into. All four actors are superb, but the standout is Burstyn, the saddest of all, a lonely widow who becomes addicted to diet pills in the vain hope of landing a spot on a TV game show. The sight of Burstyn imploding in paranoiac terror, as she hallucinates that her refrigerator is attacking her and the people on TV are laughing at her, will be etched in your memory forever. Whether you want it to be, of course, is another matter. I was glad I saw \\"Requiem for a Dream,\\" but I think once was enough. The DVD, however, is cleverly packaged (as a video by Tappy Tibbons, the TV motivational speaker Burstyn is obsessed with, played with smarmy ferocity by Christopher McDonald). It contains a compelling \\"Making Of\\" documentary, as well as a bonus video of Ellen Burstyn interviewing Hubert Selby, who is still the unhappiest kid in Brooklyn after all these years.

I'm sure if you would of met him before he died you would of relized not trash a respectable musician. You know what kind of people argue about this stuff like you do? Children and ignorant people.
B000000WZ4|5.0|This is one of my favorite DM albums along with Black Celebration, Music for the Masses and the live album 101. 'Ultra' is full of creativity and perfect DM style sounds. It is way above, very way above the half flop of 'Exciter' and above the new 'Playing the angel' and the early 90's 'Songs of Faith..'.  With Ultra they proved to be an exciting and talented group once again. This is an excellent album that sometimes is overlooked by younger DM fans. If you dont have this one, you are missing on the finest album DM has recorded in the 90's and beyond.
B00030590I|1.0|I picked it to watch because of its high rating. The movie is awful. <br />15% of the running time, the heroes were flying like birds. I got tired <br />to watch those flies. I am not talking about reality but they also <br />killed any sense of poetry. Actors acting is nothing of acting. No <br />facial expression, no body language, just dummy's martial art play <br />around the clock. You call that a perfect movie? You're kidding me!
B000AARKOO|5.0|\\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" had me a bit worried in the beginning, with the quote \\"To kill an infidel is not murder, it is the path to heaven.\\" <br /> <br />We've outgrown this statement, right? I do hope. <br /> <br />But then there was a shift. (THANKFULLY) Not everyone agreed with one another. Even here, in these beginning days of Christian rule, there were two types - those that promoted peace (tolerance of faith and so forth), and those that promoted (self) righteousness. It is amazing to me, interesting really, on so many levels. <br /> <br />Firstly because there were really no \\"bad guys\\" to this film, everyone was a blend of good and bad in their own way - the only real \\"bad guy\\" were the french. Hahaha! But really, my point is that I believe all sides got fair treatment. <br /> <br />But let us examine these bad guys, as they are the (self) righteous sect of Christianity, believing that they deserve gods favor above all others. That others must love god their way in life or know him in death. It scares me I think, to see this extrapolation in the world today - because it is not seen as a \\"bad guy\\" image. My uncle for example, is one of these, a missionary who teaches others that worshiping god his way is the only way. Needless to say, this has created much animosity between me and that part of the family. Yet my point remains, where are the \\"good guy\\" Christians? Those that don't mind how others worship god, knowing that it's all the same in the end. Where are those Christians that are honorable to all people, not just their own, for their own interests? I know they are out there, I know a few of them personally - but why is it that they are not the dominant Christian force? Why do the \\"bad guy\\" Christians continue to thrive? Come to power? <br /> <br />Gah. Anyway, as for the story and characters being historically accurate. I believe the characters to be accurate (in the sense that they existed, though I'm not so sure about Liam Neason's character...) but I couldnot say for sure, because the time of the crusades is not something I have researched heavily - while I do know bits of this and bits of that - the entire concept really does frighten me. I must have been traumatized by it in a past life or something. <br /> <br />I mean, think about it. The \\"Kingdom of Heaven\\" is this great place on earth that has great religious/spiritual significance for at least three of the worlds major religions. And yet this place, favored by god has been (and still is) a place of violence, death, war. And it makes me think, is this really what god favors? I was amazed to watch the bombardment scenes, as it occurred to me that fire and flames striking the city is something that the city has always been victim to (past, present, future?) <br /> <br />So, I liked this movie. And believe me, I was VERY ready to hate it. I was actually worried that it was going to be Richard the Lion Hearts time line/events of the crusades, so it was refreshing that it was pre-that-era. <br /> <br />So friends, I leave you with this last thought, \\"Speak the truth, even if it leads to your death.\\"
B000A0GP4K|5.0|The best DVD I have ever purchased, Scorsese put an amazing amount of material together in excellent manner.  If you even casually like Bob Dylan you will like this dual DVD set.  It could be a six DVD set and still be too short.
B0002Z0EYK|5.0|This is one of the best efforts Hollywood has ever put forth to make a genuine and tasteful production of a classic mythological story.  While the Trojan war is thought to be a historical event, much of the details in Homer were the stuff of legend, not history.<br /><br />Eric Bana and Brad Pitt are both buffed up and believable as Greek warriors.  I was skeptical of Pitt being cast as Achilles, but he turned out a surprisingly good performance.  Peter O'Toole is a natural as Priam, and Orlando Bloom plays Paris as every bit the wimp he is in the ILIAD.<br /><br />To be sure, the writers took a great many liberties in the storyline.  However, this made for a nice and cohesive plot.  In particular, I was impressed by the clever way in which they re-wrote the duel between Paris and Menelaous, as well as their blowing up the character of Chrysalias into a major & pivotal persona.  In Homer we barely get to know her at all.<br /><br />After seeing the film, some friends of mine complained that Achilles was not likeable enough.  Actually, the Achilles in TROY is far more likeable than the one in Homer's epic.  In my mind, they did a great job of making him as likeable as possible without divorcing him from the character in Homer's poem.<br /><br />Eric Bana is remarkable as Hector.  Some people I know were surprised that he is depicted as in most ways more heroic than Achilles.  After all, Hector fights for all the right reasons.  This, too, is consistent with the ILIAD.  Also, TROY is a good name for the film as ILIAD alludes to Ilion, which was another name for Troy.<br /><br />As a nice bonus, there are some scenes from and allusions to Virgil's AENEID.  This makes the production value even more endearing to the viewer.<br /><br />Whether you have ever read Homer / Virgil or not, I would HIGHLY recommend this DVD.  It has a nice 2nd disc of special features that includes an overview of the Greek pantheon (although some detail on Homer would have been nice as well).  I would recommend both the movie AND the book.  I would also recommend watching HELEN OF TROY, which is a DVD that focuses on different aspects of the myth.I would also recommend watching HELEN OF TROY, which is a DVD that focuses on different aspects of the myth.

B00002MZ2T|4.0|Savage Garden has been rather unfairly been considered as an ordinary pop/rock band by critics, who have failed to acknowledge the incredible talent of Darren Hayes and Daniel Jones for writing beautiful lyrics, filled with images and consisting of words that have been carefully chosen. <br />\\"Affirmation\\" is nowhere near the debut album of the band.  But it is, nevertheless, a great album.  Those who have analysed it carefully will ask themselves the following question: Can Savage Garden be considered as a band which followed the ideals of Romanticism and Romantic poetry?  In a sense, yes.  Let us take \\"The Animal Song\\", for example.  For this song, which is in my opinion the best on the album, Hayes and Jones have drawn inspiration from nature in writing the marvellous lyrics: the song evokes sensuous images of animals running in the jungle with \\"the wind in my hair and the sand at my feet\\".  This line is the most memorable of this beautifully written track.  The song also deals with another Romantic ideal: escapism.  It expresses the desire of the singer to live a better life and to be \\"careless and free.\\" <br />Other songs which are worth considering include \\"Hold Me\\", \\"I Knew I Loved You\\" and, to a lesser extent, \\"Affirmation.\\"  \\"Hold Me\\" has been widely acclaimed for the great music that was provided by the two guitarists, Michael Landau (electric guitars) and Dean Parks (acoustic).  The lyrics also create images and similes, e.g. \\"Enemies at war we build defenses/ And secret hiding places.\\"  Unfortunately, such aspects of Savage Garden's music and lyrics have been brutally ignored by critics.  \\"I Knew I Loved You\\": this song does not really live up to its flattering reputation.  But it is an enjoyable moment of good pop music.  \\"Affirmation\\": As many people have commented, this song is decent but the repetition of \\"I Believe\\" tends to make the song a little boring. <br />As in their debut album, the band once again show that they are good at writing and playing songs that express melancholy.  This becomes obvious when one listens to \\"The Lover After Me\\", in which both the singer and the music express nostalgia and emptiness after the departure of the loved one. <br />\\"Chained To You\\", \\"The Best Thing\\" and \\"Gunning Down Romance\\" can be considered as other decent efforts, but I don't think I could listen to theses songs often. <br />It is a pity that this album is the last of the band, because Hayes decided to start a solo career in 2001.  Savage Garden had much more to offer and could have become a legendary band if it had provided some more releases... <br />
B000AU9UYM|3.0|Thinking about this movie, all that I could do was backtrack to the earlier, more fun Batman installments that we have seen, starting with Batman (1989). Thinking back, I can remember how fun that film actually was to watch, so I thought that this one would offer up some of the same action packed material that the other ones did....WRONG!!  <br />This story does deliver what the title says, Batman Begins...which shows us exactly how the Batman character came to life. Other than a few fight scenes, this movie is more of a dialouge film than anything...is this for kids??? Yeah, the comatose ones...if you have a child that is into action, and just plain out fun like the other Batman's had to offer, then this one is not for them.  If they have a true interest in the Batman character, and I mean a true interest, then yes, this one they will appreciate.... <br />I am not saying that this film is BAD in anyway, but be warned, I am sure that it is not what you think it will be....
B0006IUDXA|4.0|a great buy, lacking 1 star because there was no extra features on the dvd, and the video and audio quality looked like it hasn't been touched from when i saw it 15-or-so years ago. however, it is macgyver and a trip down memory lane just doesn't get any better than this.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|I have to confess I actually like Depeche Mode's last album \\"Exciter\\" but it did lack the familiar synth-pop sound. \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a return to the band's earlier synth-pop sound yet still manages to incorporate elements of their more recent material from the past several years. The abrasive opening notes to \\"A Pain that I'm Used to\\" has that minimalist, industrial sound that would have made the song perfect for \\"Ultra\\". The first single off the new album is the haunting \\"Precious\\" which is one of the most beautiful Depeche Mode ballads I have heard in years. This is the song that made me want to get \\"Playing the Angel\\" on the day of its release. I just love the swirling synthesized melodies, downtempo beats, and Dave's vocals. One of the best songs of 2005 without a shadow ofa doubt. \\"Suffer Well\\" is one of my favorite songs on the album. The combination of guitars and the perculating electronic beats is well balanced. Neither overpowers the other sound. \\"John the Revelator\\" is an infectious dance track that is hard not to sing a long too. \\"Lilian\\" is another beautiful ballad. Dave Gahan's deep voice sounds the best to me when he is singing ballads. I just get chills down my spine when is singing a ballad. Most of the songs worked but not all of the tracks were spot on. There were a couple of weak tracks but overall I immensely enjoyed \\"Playing the Angel\\". With the exception of \\"Suffer Well\\", the tracks that Dave Gahan wrote \\"I Want it All\\" and \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" were a bit flat and lacked the punch that Martin Gore's songs had. \\"Playing the Angel\\" may not be considered a classic like \\"Violator\\" is but I don't care. \\"Playing the Angel\\" is a very good Depeche Mode album I thought.
076790592X|2.0|This book is Exhibit A as to why people love asking barbers,beauticians,bartenders and cab drivers for advice or therapy-rather than \\"intellectuals\\".My mother of blessed memory was a non-college graduate,who fought cancer for thirteen years-and on her worst day had more worthwhile things to say than Morrie does in this book;I assume the same is true for most <br />\\"non-professors\\" as well.Albom informs us that Morrie was \\"born  <br />Jewish,but became an agnostic when he was a teenager,partly because of all that happened to him as a child..\\"This is nonsense-people who have religious faith don't become agnostics because of hard times.And Morrie's use of Auden's quote,\\"Love each other or perish,\\"-is sort of like the quote on the statue in 'Animal House':\\"Knowledge is good.\\"Hopefully,the sequel to this pompous bore of a book will be about Morrie the cab driver.

B000AARKO4|4.0|I never saw this in the theaters because I hardly knew of its existence; I saw no advertising or theater trailers and heard no gossip about it, it was very quietly released, at least where I was in the US. I picked up the DVD on recommendation from a friend at work, and I ended up being very impressed. I'm not a really huge fan of Ridley Scott- I've only seen Gladiator and Alien- but I find myself wanting to go back and see more of his work after this. <br /> <br />The first thing I have to mention is Edward Norton's portrayal of King Baldwin IV. It's beautiful. I can't remember the last time a movie character affected me the way his Leper King did. He's got the perfect mixture of nobility, inner strength and wisdom, youth and fatigue brought on by his illness. Besides that, he's visually striking- rail-thin, swathed in silks and distorted face obscured by a silver mask. The voice Norton gives him is sweet and a little reedy. I've heard comparisons to Brando but I'm not very familiar with him so I can't say. My only regret about the character is we don't see enough of him. He only has six scenes, and I greatly hope that the Director's Cut includes some more on Baldwin.  <br /> <br />I'm also impressed with Orlando Bloom's performance. I think he's really fleshing out as an actor. He does have some problems with being to low-key, and the few times where he smiles or gets angry are a welcome change. He's very good in his battle scenes as well. I'm used to thinking of him as very skinny due to his Legolas role, but he's put on some muscle and can hold his own in a fight. <br /> <br />The supporting characters deserve a mention too. David Thewlis, one of my favorites, plays a very compelling warrior priest, the Hospitaller, who believes that right action is more important than religion. Jeremy Irons is great as a good guy for a change, a war-weary Marshal of Jerusalem, trying to keep the piece but getting little help.  <br /> <br />I was also blown away by Ghassan Massaud as Saladin. Far from being your typical Hollywood leader of the bad guys, he's shown as wise and compassionate, a match for the Christian King Baldwin.  <br /> <br />As much as I love the characters, the writing often doesn't do them justice. There are various plot points that don't make much sense, such as why Balian gets over his dead wife so quickly in order to get involved with Sybilla, or how he gets to be such an expert in defending castles from outside bombardment. I would much rather the romantic subplot between him and Sybilla be left out. It seemed not only out of place for the characters but for the times as well. Adultery was not something to be taken lightly in the Middle Ages. <br /> <br />Not being very knowledgeable on Medieval history, I can't say exactly how accurate the movie's depiction of people and places is, however I do know that some major changes were made. I was pretty happy overall with the way it worked out, except for the afore mentioned romantic liason, and Balian's over-quick rise to power.  <br /> <br />Though it has some flaws, it's still a very involving and emotionally engaging, as well as making people think differently about the whole middle-east conflict and how the events of a thousand years ago continue to influence events of today. It makes no excuses for crimes committed on and against both sides, condemnes extremism and encourages everybody to try to understand things from the other guy's point of view. While it can be preachy, this is still a lesson everybody needs to heed.
B00002Z88D|1.0|I really liked the original versions of most of the songs on this CD and I am a big fan of early Metallica albums ( the so-called \\"Black Album\\" and prior works). I also firmly believe that if two types of music can be mixed into a brilliant and wonderful piece of work, it is classical and metal. After all, heavy metal uses much of the same musical theory that classical does and to be honest I believe that some classical composers (Mozart for example) were simply heavy metal musicians working with the music and instruments of their time. Many metal/rock bands have achieved a certain mesure of success when combining their music with an orchestra: Deep Purple, Dream Theater, Iron Maiden, Yngwie Malmsteen and Queensryche for example have all had some orchestral contributions to various works. This offering from Metallica however is way off the mark of being that one great masterpiece. <br /> <br />In S&M the orchestral music is masterfully played. Metallica on the other hand...well all I can say is \\"What the hell happened?\\" It was like watching a car wreck in slow motion. In my humble opinion the only reason Metallica had an orchestra on this album was to help offset the mediocrity of their own performance with something technically outstanding. This is really depressing for me to say because Metallica used to be a great live act. <br /> <br />In many places it almost sounded like Metallica and the orchestra were playing different songs because the timing of both groups were way off each others mark. I believe this to really be Matallica's fault because the orchestra seemed to keep time perfectly. Metallica however was all over the place and not keeping their pace very well. Perhaps if these performances were recorded ten years prior, when Metallica was still a great live band, things would have come together better for them. As it stands however, this CD is a great disappointment. <br />

James Frey takes you by the hand, and leads you through a lifestyle most of us never knew existed.  He rubs your face in the garbage, and lets you smell the stench, and you feel the pain.

And you will wonder, perhaps forever more, which came first...the pain or the addiction.<br /><br />I'm exhausted from this trip with Mr. Frey, yet I'm grateful that he took me along for the ride. Maybe those who study addictions have taken the same ride and will use Mr. Frey's experiences and the horrors of addiction to speed up their research on possible causes and cures.<br /><br />Recommended.
0553382179|2.0|I deliberately \\"borrowed\\" the title of my review for this book, because I completely agreed with another reader who noted that the \\"tone\\" of the book comes across both as preachy (with some suspect religious overtones) and shrill. Worse, there are times when the author seems to berate the reader, and this is where the \\"mean\\" designation comes in.<br /><br />What about the rest of the content? Well, if you really need a book to tell you to empty your trash and clean your sink, then I guess this might be the book for you. But for this reader, that info. was just a little TOO basic.<br /><br />I would have preferred some organizing tips that addressed concerns for working women, women with un-cooperative husbands, etc. (It seems all the women who are \\"flybabies\\" have DH's, aka: Darling Husbands.)<br /><br />As another reader noted, the book seemed to be aimed at those who are very depressed, and need daily motivation to just get dressed and get moving.<br /><br />[...]<br /><br />Good luck!
B000AU9UYC|2.0|This movie was sorta hard for me to get into. I felt like it left out some crucial points and didn't really show the depth of Bruce Wayne's character. Towards the end though I really like it because it started getting action packed and leaving me wanting more but I was very disappointed with the way it ended. It could've been better.

When i got to chapters 8-10 i couldnt put this book down! it was simply amazing and unpredictable. Fighting Ruben Wolf used to be my favorite book, but now The Giver is. I cant wait for tommorrow(monday) cause im going strait to the libary and picking up The Messenger. and i hate books. A must read!
B000002O5L|4.0|One of the things I've always admired about Tom Petty is his uncanny ability to get the most out of every song.  Seriously, I usually chafe at stuff like Yer So Bad or A Face In The Crowd, and somehow, he makes it not only listenable, but enjoyable.  Part of it, of course, is that he never overextends himself; you'll never hear him belt or force anything.  He doesn't have to.  The music speaks for itself.<br /><br />This is a cool album (in every sense of the word) and great background music.  Just a *few* dull spots keep me from giving this a 5.
B000002H97|5.0|With that said, I now go onto the review: Metallica: the Black Album!m A truly awesome album! Metallica's first diamond selling album: 15 million strong today. How did they do it you ask? Well, it all begins with a change in style; they couldn't stay thrashy forever and expect to become gods, come on people: thrash is great but it will not get any band to godhood. Just look at Slayer, they have been doing thrash for 20+ years now and their greatest album went 4+ platinum and they think cursing is awesome and that saying: \\"oh! god hates us all!\\" they are living in a van down by the river compared to Metallica!<br /><br />Track Listing:<br />1.Enter Sandman: What alot of people consider Metallica's trademark song, putting this track first best shows Metallica's evolution from crashy thrash since Dyer's Eve on ..And Justice for All. Even though this track is hard and heavy anybody who is anybody will dig this track. 10/10<br />2.Sad But True: You know how great a song is when even crappy rock posers like Kid Rock use the riffs in their songs (I still think \\"American Bad@ss\\" or whatever that track is called sucks, dont get me wrong). Kirk's riffs are outstanding, they are not like the overly heavy riffs from Justice, it sounds like hard rock guitar. If you could look up hard rock sound in the encyclopedia, this would be right next to it. 10/10<br />3.Holier than Thou: Even though they were no longer thrash, the transition isn't always a good thing. Take Holier than Thou for example: its a hard rock track but it is also obviously filler material. The guitar on here sounds too much like Scott Ian rhythm (which isn't bad, but this is Metallica) and the lyrics aren't really great (\\"No more, the crap rolls out your mouth again\\"? WTC!!) 6/10<br />4.The Unforgiven: Metallica's first true power ballad. I wouldn't call Fade to Black or Sanitarium power ballads, they are more darker songs, of subject material that is frightening while this song is about.... wait, what the crap is it about? It makes no friggn sense! The lyrics are inspired, Hammetts guitar work is moving, but I still don't know the message behind it! Unlike other so called \\"old metallica fans\\", I actually like this song better than their previous efforts; it shows real evolution for a band to go from \\"ahh, F#$k you!\\" to \\"want to join us at Borders?\\" 9.5/10<br />5.Wherever I may Roam: Another Tallica classic, the guitar work form Kirk on this track is ART. Thank god Lars and James finally let him wear the pants for at least this track or who knows how long he would have been doing thrashy riff after thrashy riff. If I learned anything from this track it is that if it weren't for Kirk's artistic playing in this album and the ones before it Metallica would sound like every other overtly heavy thrash band. 10/10<br />6.Don't Tread on Me: Unlike the whole Justice album, at least this song doesn't leave the listener thinking: \\"its about justice, ladefriggn DA!\\" Its a short song for Metallica in this age and time but the lyrics actually make freedom sound good. I think Kirk has a great guitar piece in this, which he probably picked up from lessons with Joe Satriani when he just joined Metallica. 10/10<br />7.Through the Never: This song sometimes seems like they added it just to make an album over an hour in length. First, the guitar work is weird, so almost everything else on this. Sounds like they were TRYING TO MAKE FILTER. Fluff: 6/10<br />8.Nothing Else Matters: This track is what I would call the centerpiece of the album. Sure, Enter Sandman may be the biggest single from this album and Unforgiven may be Tallica's first power ballad, but this is hard rock classic defined. Everyone is like:\\" Man, One is Metallica's best ever!\\" Whatever! One is nowhere near their best! It's great but not the best. The string arrangement adds a whole dimension to Metallica's playing and enriches Kirks playing. Kirks guitar spots are almost reminiscent of Randy Rhoads' spots in \\"Diary of a Madman\\" or \\"Revelation (Mother Earth)\\". Just when I though we would never hear what Kirk always called his \\"Rhoads influenced guitar playing\\", not only does the song sound great, but it ends up being what many call Metallica's greatest work. 11/10<br />9.Of Wolf and Man: Loud, Heavy, straight-out metal. The intro bang drum assault and loud tempo rings are stringing to the soul. Also, these lyrics scream \\"James Heitfeld!\\" so loud it isn't even funny. 10/10<br />10.God that Failed: A good song, not filler but not \\"Wow!\\" 8/10<br />11.My Friend of Misery: Long, complex songwriting with a bit of zucato instument work. Not very impressive, I think it is a little overated. 8/10<br />12.Struggle Within: It is really hard to write reviews for albums with more than 10 tracks, that is why these latter track reviews suck like crap, so I will try as hard as I can to do a good job on this one. This is the fast paced allout rocker on this album, the vocals are fast paced and aggressive, the drums and bass loud, but the standout on here is definitely Kirks solo: it is pure awesomeness. It sounds like classic VH virtuoso mixed with with heavy Motorhead-like tempo, the first obvious virtuoso guitar work i have heard from Kirk. 10/10<br /><br />Anyone who calls this album a sell-out are idiots. Just because a band makes an album that goes diamond and get a ton of air time on the radio does not make it a sellout. If that were the case then Led Zeppelin would have 'sold out' after Led Zeppelin fourth, or the Eagles after Hell Freezes Over, or Van Halen after their first album(how can they sell out if it is their first album, dum@sses?)! If anything, Metallica got better after this album. Thrash is good, but did anyone actually think for one second that Metallica could become icons by remaining in the tharsh zone? no friggn way! In order for one to prosper in the music biz they must obtain art, and thrash is not art, it is extremely heavy bass, loud drums, and really distorted guitar noise. I'm not saying that everything before this album sucked, it just wasn't art. I am also not justifying St. Anger's existence, I think it was a stupid piece of crap that is only exceeded by Nevermind. If you guys want to call any Metallica album the sellout, choose Load; at least it makes sense because they cut their hair and wore mascera!

B000BKVQTS|5.0|I've heard a few people say they were disappointed after seing this film; they had expected better. I think a lot of people have the wrong expectations when it comes to The Brothers Grimm: in the theatre I see lots of people of whom I can tell from moment one they will be disappointed.  <br /> <br />Mothers with young children who actually think this movie has anything to do with the traditional fairy tales; this movie is NOT for children! If I were 7 I'd wet my bed for days after seing The Brothers Grimm. Young boys and girls on dates, all expecting an easy digestive romcom with an obvious storyline and no depth (I don't know how they got there but they did). That is NOT the case. If you want Finding Nemo, go see Finding Nemo. If you want American Pie, go see American Pie. But don't complain about The Brothers Grimm, because it is an absolute masterpiece! <br /> <br />The storyline is entertaining (one of the few movies that doesn't make you go \\"when's the intermission already? I need to pee!\\"), the director paints an amazing picture with his brilliant set, the characters are adorable and the actors do an amazing job. There wasn't a moment I saw them acting instead of being. One thing that really caught my attention was the role of Angelika (by Lena Heady) which reminded me in every single way of Keira Knightley's version of Guinevere in King Arthur - in a good way though. <br /> <br />Overall, I think this movie is a serious tribute to the fantasy genre, and I think that people who can appreciate that will love this. Don't look for logic, don't look for unexpected plots like in The Village and The Others, don't expect American Pie jokes and FOR GOD'S SAKE don't take your little children with you to this movie. <br /> <br />This is a brilliant movie that can hold it's own and if you ask me it deserves lots and lots of attention and awards. <br /> <br />YOU WILL LIKE THIS MOVIE IF YOU LIKE... Sleepy Hollow (with Johnny Depp and Christina Ricci), King Arthur (with Clive Owen and Keira Knightley), Pirates of the Caribbean (with Johnny Depp and Orlando Bloom).
B000A7DVR2|3.0|I was expecting this collector's edition to be, like, totally unspoiled, man--but really, its just a bad acid flashback.  Unable to achieve, on a level field of play, the special features just consist of a re-run of \\"the making of the big lebowski\\" and some random liner notes more cheaply gotten from google than from paying out 15 bones, or clams, or what have you.    I mean, this isn't Nam, Smokey, there are rules--a Collector's edition should be privy to all the new stuff, man!  Where are the retrospectives, where are the commentaries on how \\"The Great Lebowski\\" was such an earth-shattering cultural phenom?  A few more extras would have really tied the DVD together, man.    Compared to the oriiginal DVD release, this so-called \\"special edition\\" feels as lame as a 9-toed woman. Unless you are a special-feature nihilist (you believe that special features should be nothing).  you're better off with the original-release DVD than this special edition.      Obligatory Parthian shot: Well, its pretty scary, but the Dude & his Lady friend, who he was helping to concieve--their kid is going to first grade this year, apparently!
B000B7HZXM|4.0|This is another good cd but the novelty is wearing off.  He doesn't need the money, and so I'd rather see him tour more with the songs he already has in his collection than to see him do remake after remake and not tour so much.  His voice is incredible still and he will probably appeal to an older audience than he ever used to.  But how many cds like this is he going to continue to make?  The main highlight on the cd is the song with Diana Ross.  Don't get me wrong, I love Rod and I love this cd, but how about going back to make more rock music instead of this, or tour more.
0385334206|1.0|I'd say it was a book purposely written stupidly to appear clever. I found it extremely dull. I gagged out 1/2 way through it. I gurantee I can write better than this.

B0006GAI6O|5.0|I've just watched this for the billionth time.  I really like it.  It's got a great mix of humour, romance, dance and fantastic music.  I do actually like most things I've seen Jennifer Lopez in.  She's great in this and so is Richard Gere.  He is a man in a just over mid-life crisis.  He's looking for something new to spice up his life and after seeing J Lo's character through his window of the train, he eventually signs up for dance classes.  The rest is a predictable storyline, but it's fun and enjoyable and his poor suspecting wife is played really well by Susan Sarandon.  Watch for the bonus feature of the Pussycat Dolls version of Sway.  This is where I first heard of them almost a year ago, and only now are they getting some props.  A very good film that has something for almost everyone.
B00062IVKS|3.0|I really want to give this 2 stars, but because the acting and cinematography is superb, I'm giving it 3. <br /> <br />The big problem with this movie is that there is absolutley no character development whatsoever. The viewer is denied any chance to understand any of the characters. It is as if the writers have completely dehumanized the cast of characters and are portraying them more as animals. Man is not an animal. Man has feelings, thoughts, emotions, memories, a conscience. To portray a person as an animal is down right insulting. By the end of the movie, I was led to believe that the Jake LaMotta character was mentally insane which is not an accurate depiction by any means.  The writers should have stuck with Jake LaMotta's story. It was his story, afer all, even if they didn't seem to like it. Maybe it's a good thing the actors and Scorsese didn't stick completely to the script. <br /> <br />An alright movie with lots of boxing shots (too gruesome for me , however) and local color, that will however not allow you to connect with the characters.
B0001US8EO|5.0|This movies is worth watching on the big screen. And I don't mean the multiplex type of big screens. This movie is really awesome on one of those older movie theatres with the extra large projection screens. The movie is simply amazing. The characters are well played and the storyline is fantastic. It's a longish movie but that's the time required to tell this story. If you have'nt seen it and like the wild west and it's history, then this is a movie definitely worth watching. Kevin Costner is excellent, probably his best movie.

B00005J6SZ|5.0|Madonna's second release, \\"Like a Virgin,\\" made her a superstar and moved her from pure dance to a more pop- and R&B-tinged sound.  Released in 1984, everything about this CD is superb.  Madonna's voice was much improved from her debut (although still a bit thin compared to her later vocals), and the production by Nile Rodgers is first-rate. The first single, \\"Like a Virgin,\\" was a mega-smash, logging 6 weeks at #1; it would be 7 years before another song had that many weeks at #1 - Bryan Adam's \\"(Everything I Do) I Do It For You.\\"  The song even made the Top 10 on the R&B chart!  At the time, the song was a bit scandalous but today it's pretty tame.  However, anyway you look at it, \\"Like a Virgin\\" is a great pop song.  The video was also her first high-budget effort; although her writhing in a Venice gondola and being seduced by a man in a lion's mask are more than a bit silly, it's also a gorgeous video.<br /><br />Three subsequent singles were released and made the Top 5.  \\"Material Girl\\" became an anthem of sort.  The video may have featured an actress spurning the advances of a wealthy lothario in favor of a poor, truck-driving Keith Carradine, but the message of the song suggested the opposite - Madonna proudly proclaimed her love of fame and power.  The song helped make Madonna the Marilyn Monroe of the 80s, and gave her the dreaded nickname she tried vainly to abandon for many years.  The third single was a bit of a surprise to me - \\"Angel.\\"  It's a beautiful song, but not as catchy or immediate as a number of other songs on the CD.  It peaked at #5.  \\"Dress You Up\\" was the final release, making it to #5.  Shockingly, the song was included in the \\"Filthy Fifteen\\" published by Tipper Gore's Parent Music Resource Center, presumably for the rather tame reference to \\"velvet kisses.\\"  It's a terrific pop song that's not the slightest bit profane.<br /><br />\\"Love Don't Live Here Anymore\\" is another highlight - a lush remake of the Rose Royce 70s hit.  I loved the song when \\"Like a Virgin\\" was initially released and wanted it released as a single.  However, Madonna subsequently remixed the song and included it on her 1996 ballad collection (Something to Remember); the song was belatedly made the chart, although it sputtered out at #78.  \\"Shoo-Bee-Doo\\" is another terrific song - it combines seamlessly a 60s girl group sound with 80s pop.  Arguably the most dance-oriented song is \\"Over and Over,\\" and it's very good.  \\"Stay\\" has a great drum-loop unusual for a Madonna song.  Finally, \\"Pretender\\" is arguably the weakest of the bunch, but still a pretty decent song.<br /><br />Overall, the songs are much more diverse on \\"Like a Virgin\\" than on her first record, \\"Madonna.\\"  Her growth as an artist really started here and would continue over the next two decades.  Although \\"Like a Virgin\\" is probably not Madonna's best CD, it ranks right up there, particularly if you like the more \\"pop\\" side of her music.  Most highly recommended.d the song when \\"Like a Virgin\\" was initially released and wanted it released as a single.

B000B5XOYI|4.0|There's quite a few good extras. I especially like the Shadows of the Bat documentaries, and also the history of Batman feature. It's nice to see comments on the characters by folks like Dennis O'Neill, Frank Miller and Paul Dini. <br /> <br /> It's a bit interesting to see some of the DC Comics enforced restrictions. For example, they talk about Dr. Wertham's Seduction of the Innocent book quite a bit, but neglect to mention the most Batman-specific factoid, that Wertham claimed Batman and Robin were gay. Bill Finger gets copious mentions, but you still couldn't get a sense of how much of the Batman mythos that he and Jerry Robinson created. (For example, it's stated that they came along later, even though Finger wrote Batman's first apperance.) It's corporate policy that Bob Kane created everything and that the others merely helped. <br /> <br />  The abannoned Robin sequence from the first film is interesting, and I like that they got the definitive animated voices to read the script over the storyboards. <br /> <br />  As for the movies themselves, watching it, I really enjoyed seeing the first two Batman films again. They have their flaws, but there's still a strong artistic sense to them. Tim Burton wasn't trying to create toy commercials. <br /> <br />  As for the last two, well... it bugs the hell out of me that Joel Schumacher keeps excusing every story problem, every bit of dopey dialogue as \\"it's a comic book\\" or \\"it's a cartoon\\". Schumacher, people who do comic book movies should actually respect the artform. They should work to bring out the strengths of comics, not replicate the weaknesses of the worst examples of the medium. The director's poor attitude realls explains all the problems of those movies. <br /> <br />  But this boxed set is cheap enough that the last two films can be counted as extras to the first two. If you can spare about 10 dollars for the sake of completeness, then it's worth getting this anthology set.
B0002Z0EYK|3.0|i was excited by the trailers i saw in the movies and anxiously looked forward to this movie for months.  alas, my anticipation led to disappointment.  i didn't think this was a bad film.  there were some fine action scenes and the visual of the \\"thousand ships\\" launched by the lovely face of helen was impressive even if it was completely cgi.  brad pitt looked amazing.  very sinewy and dynamic, but he had no real soul or raison d'etre as the french would say.  action and sex appeal may be enough for some films, but this is a classic that is over 2000 years old.  we demand more.  eric bana did the most he could with a weak script and gave the most compelling perfermance in the film.  orlando bloom didn't have a chance in this film although he might have made a bit more of his character.  the bottom line is that this is not a terrible film, but it doesn't really satify the action film fan or the classical afficianado.  the director is in some sort of artistic no mans land.  brad pitt's muscular torso can sell some tickets, but it won't create art.  someone else please try again.  oh yeah, the definitive version of the odyssey hasn't been done yet either.  i ask too much.

This book just jumps right into the deep end and carries you along. <br />Mr.Frey's experiences are so well spoken; I feel like I am actually witnessing his ordeal firsthand. <br /> <br />The only problem I have with the credibility of the author's story is his tale of the brutal oral surgery without any novicaine whatsoever. Is novacaine an addicting pain killer? I don't think so. It seems that the whole ordeal was over the top. And, why on earth would a patient in rehab be allowed to walk around in clothes that have spit, blood and vomit on them? If this rehab center is so highly acclaimed, I hardly think that this would have occurred. <br /> <br />If Mr. Frey can explain this, I would really appreciate it. <br /> <br />So far, the book raises more questions than it answers. But it is a riveting, yet simply written read.
0307276902|5.0|Awesome book - a must read for everyone.  A sobering look at exactly how addiction works to totally unravel one's life and just how difficult recovery is.  The word \\"fury\\" now has new meaning.  Two thumbs up for James Frey and I'm telling everyone I know about this book.

B00005JKZV|5.0|I read these books as a child long before they were popular in the \\"escapist\\" 70's.  The three movies do the books justice and bring the books to life.  All three are excellent DVDs with great picture and sound.  If only more such films were being made.  I guess heroism, friendship and love are out of fashion, but the success of these films proves that they are not dead.
B0000ADY9I|5.0|I started off with the cd's of these album non-remastered.  I bought mine from BMG and except for this deluxe edition, which is remastered and The Fillmore Concerts, which is also remastered, the actual albums they sell are not.  After realizing this I sold the originals in favor of the remasters and it's like falling in love with the music all over again!  I don't recommend this for everyone ofcourse but for you audio philes I do. Read reviews first ofcourse.<br /><br />Now I started with The Fillmore Concerts and while that's a very interesting release and not bad in any way I prefer this release by far over that one.  I've grown up listening to The Allman Brothers here in Austin, TX but I never owned any of their albums except for A Decade of Hits 1969 - 1979 until the last year.<br /><br />Now I 'could' go and buy the remastered original release of Live at the Fillmore (with 7 tracks instead of 13) just to hear the original track order that everyone heard back in the day but there's no need since all the songs are present on the deluxe edition.  One can just make a compilation of the original 7, which I do plan on doing today. If you're a purist this new \\"deluxe\\" edition might offend you. But I'm just comparing this to The Fillmore Concerts more than to the original 7 song release.  This is the original mix remastered, nothing altered on the songs you know and love.  With that in mind, this deluxe edition feels like a concert!  The added reverb on The Fillmore Concerts was NOT necessary!  And while it was the work of the original producer it was not a release put out by the original band.  If you're a completist you'll probably want those alternate mixes found on The Fillmore Concerts.  Heck, by the end of this journey I may want them!  But for now, I just got \\"Dreams\\" the box set and all my remastered versions of Allman Brothers Band up thru Brothers & Sisters and like is good.<br /><br />And I've heard very good things about a couple of recent releases.  This band is still around in a slightly different format kicking a** and taking names!  But I want to submerse myself in the classic stuff first because I prefer 60's and 70's music the most.<br /><br />Between Dreams, Allman Brothers Band, IdleWild South (I had Beginnings before non-remastered), Live at the Fillmore East [Deluxe Edition], Eat A Peach, and Brothers & Sisters I feel set for the moment.

0894803123|3.0|Like many other people, I love Ben & Jerry's ice cream.  Unfortunately, the premium taste also comes with a premium price, so many years ago my husband gifted me with this book.<br /><br />It's fun to read about how it all began (two chubby little boys who liked eating more than gym- and who can blame them?) and how they fought off the evil Pilsbury Dough Boy to take a stand in the giant world of commercially delivered ice cream.  But really, I'm here for the recipes.  Sadly, they had some flaws.<br /><br />While I realize this was written over ten years ago, I think it's almost inexcusable that nowhere do the authors mention cooking the eggs before you use them.  Even if you aren't concerned with salmonella (and if you're using egg yolks, you should be), the difference between a raw and cooked egg base is immense- no matter how much chocolate you throw at it, raw eggs just aren't going to be as delicious.  Reams of dessert recipes later, I've figured out how to do it (beat the eggs and sugar, scald the milk, slowly add to egg mixture then carefully cook over low heat until you have something resembling a custard sauce NOT scrambled eggs; chill, then add your cream- THEN use the ice cream maker).  Was that so hard?<br /><br />Also, while I appreciate that they are ice cream makers and not bakers, the recipes they give for their ice cream cakes are off as far as amounts given.  For instance, for their brownie ice cream cake, they advise baking their Superfudge brownies in two six inch cake pans and then covering the confection with 1 quart of beaten whipping cream.  Having made this recipe several times, I can say without any doubt that their proportions are all wrong- you'll end up with enough left over batter for more than a few cupcakes and possibly another layer.  And having doubled this recipe and successfully frosted it with the whippings of two cups of cream, either they whipped their cream to butter or they miscalculated (and didn't test) this recipe.<br /><br />Still, once you have the technique down (Nigella Lawson's books are good for that), the ingredients and amounts they list work pretty well (again, if you're not baking).  I'll never part with this, but I wouldn't give this to anyone just starting out on their homemade ice cream adventure.br /> <br />Still, once you have the technique down (Nigella Lawson's books are good for that), the ingredients and amounts they list work pretty well (again, if you're not baking).

B000A0GP4K|5.0|I have followed Dylan's career for 40 yrs. and owned every album he has made at one time or another. I have also read just about everything ever written about him. This dvd gives a special insight into the man....Just wonderful.
1878424319|5.0|An excellent book containing a guide to personal freedom. It is an incredibly easy read. Everything is explained in plain english, and important concepts are repeated throughout. Much like buddhism, it explains how to live a happy life through simple common sense. Once you have read this, you will wonder why you have never realized it before. This book also makes an excellent gift for anyone with an open mind, and the will to have a satisfying life.
B000BTC5LW|4.0|um...ok first off: this concert sucks compared to the real versions of the songs and the live versions of the older songs with Roger Waters...but we all know that he is not there, so besides that the concert rocks and yea except for Guy Pratt, the absolutely horrid bass player (he screws up Another brick in the wall people!), and the saxaphone from Dick parry is unexpectedly bad, as well as the decision to play some really bad songs and screw up good ones like Astronomy Domine (the Syd classic, not even Dave can save this one from being ruined) and Brain Damage and Eclipse (I am sorry but those songs are just meant to be sung by Roger, they could have at least have had Rick or Jon Carin sing it as they are closer to Roger's vocal range). All that being said, the concert is the only official document we have of a Floyd concert, so everyone should be wicked excited for this. Also, there are some really good songs on here: Shine On is well, what else can I say; Sorrow is rocking; Learning to Fly is only good live; Run Like Hell kills the studio version; and the best version of Comfortably Numb is in this video (except for the Live 8 version but thats mainly for sentimental value). <br />So, buy this dvd because it feels good to have Floyd (pardon the pun) \\"pulsing\\" through a sourround sound system.
B0002OERI0|1.0|i used to think that this album was good. hell, i was stupid enough to think it was a punk album. i bought the album, and i said it was good. after a while i realized that i was kidding myself and that it was a terrible album. green day claims that they are totally against bush and that they are helping defeat him, but then they go on trl and do all this crap supporting corporations and people that they supposedly hate. they do all this while making terrible music that sounds like the the worst possible mix between the backstreet boys and my chemical romance(who are both god awful in case you are an idiot). All of their fans think its a mature record because it has a)a political statement and b)has profanity. this is sad.  <br />a terrible band and a terrible album.
B000BB1MI2|5.0|HAHAHAHA!! The funny thing is that indeed from the beggining of the movie Johny Depp reminds me of Michael Jackson!! Nevertheless, he is funny and great throughout the film (as always that is) and the story kept me watching the whole time. I am glad that I saw this movie in the theater and glad that there is a Tim Burton and a Spielberg (when he doesn't fell like its oscar time and don't need quick money for nothing -War of the..-) out there who do what they do out of love for the fantastic, the fairy tale, the unexplained, the future etc. These guys are the real artists in the movie industry that keep me relaxed knowing that no matter how old I get these guys can make me feel like a child again....

0307276902|5.0|James Frey's account of his time in treatment is a must read for addicts, recovering addicts and non addicts alike.  This the most raw and personal book I have ever read.  There were moments in the book when I felt physically ill and moments where I found myself biting my own lip out of shear anquish for this person.  It is an inspiring account of a very brave young man who had already been through so much in his life-now he is about to take on his biggest battle yet. The book reads very quickly and a person would want to rush through to find out what is going to happen next.  You will also notice that you are staying up later than usual to read this!  My advice is to read it as slow as possible.  There are so many facets and layers to this memoir and each detail adds up to something wonderful.

B00004SU5J|5.0|Giving five stars to records like \\"Tourist\\" is a no-brainer. Here is an album that stands in a class of its own. There's no hype machine, no belly-baring vocalists, and none of the songs are ridiculously overproduced. It's a winning basket of jazzed-up midtempo grooves with mild, electronic touches. A must have! <br /> <br />

Just unbelivable the work of pure genus , a talant such are Mr. Plants are timless and as much as I love this collection Of Roberts spiritules I look forward to his next , But please take your time making it . This is a desert island CD with out a doubt.  This CD has it all from Blues to Trance . Every one go'es on about Roberts age as one near his age I must say music that draws from our path in life can be a wonderful thing , I wonder what his next pilgramige will bring .

B00005JNJV|5.0|As a long time Batman fan (I do use a Batman Comforter), I think that this Batman movie is the best of the lot.  While all are fun this one seemed to capture the dark charm of Batman so much better then the others.  You get to see Bruce Wayne before Batman and really see that Batman over any other superhero is really just a man trying to make the world a safer place.  Now, that I've got that out of my system let me just say that Christian Bale was great.  The whole movie had fantastic casting.  Katie Holmes wasn't very believable as a strong district atorney and really didn't hold up that well against Bale on the screen.  I believe that the moive is interesting enough that even people who are watching the movie simply because it is Batman will love it too.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Really, this new DM album is nothing to write home about, but it is something that more people need to give honest reviews on. At best, I would rate Playing the Angel 2 stars. And since I'm generous, I will do so. But there's no way in hell this DM album is as good as these 4 and 5-star reviews try to make people believe. Just listen to the samples. There's only two good songs. Track 1 \\"Pain I'm Used To\\" is nice and and kinda dark in a cliched way, but I expect more than just \\"nice\\" and \\"kinda dark\\" from DM. These are the guys that delivered us \\"Black Celebration\\", \\"Strangelove\\", \\"Behind the Wheel\\", \\"Never Let Me Down\\", \\"Master & Servant\\", \\"Blasphemous Rumours\\", \\"Everything Counts\\", \\"In Your Room\\", \\"Barrel of a Gun\\", \\"It's No Good\\", and at least 50 other amazing songs. Playing the Angel is crap compared to everything before Exciter. The other track that had potential but wasn't taken to its furthest is the \\"Enjoy the Silence\\" rip-off entitled \\"Precious\\". The rest of the album is a throwaway. I don't know WHY nobody has pointed out yet that the Gahan-penned \\"Nothing's Impossible\\" has Gary Numan singing... oh, wait... it's actually Dave ripping off Numan's unmistakable monotone drone, but it needs to be said.  <br /> <br />Buy any DM album before Exiter instead of this album. Or better yet, buy some DM singles. I suggest the AWESOME Walking in My Shoes single (with has a b-side that beats the crap out of anything on Playing the Angel: The beautiful and soulful \\"My Joy\\")

B000BB1MI2|5.0|I was initially skeptical to watch this movie, as I grew up with the Gene Wilder original. I watched Willy Wonka so many times as a kid, and now as an adult I really didn't think Charlie and the Chocolate Factory would illustrate to me anything worth watching that I hadn't already seen. Well, to my pleasant surprise, I truly enjoyed this version of the story much more than the original. I'm not really a Tim Burton fan, but I must say that he did a brilliant job with this remake of the story. And Johnny Depp did an outstanding job at portraying the eccentric but likable Wonka. I truly enjoyed the Oompa-Loompas and their funny performances, and how Wonka found them in Oompa-Loompa land, hilarious. The cinematography of the entire movie was on target and reminded me somewhat of the Lemony Snickets movie in that respect. The movie had comedy throughout, and was one of the best remakes I have ever watched.

B000B2YQX4|5.0|<br />Almost 25 years have passed since Depeche Mode recorded their first album, Speak and Spell. They became the best and most influential band in the electronic scene, and also  one of the biggest and most important acts in the world. Obviously, all of these achievements force them to give their best in every new album they release. And this is what we find in Playing the Angel.  <br /> <br />The album starts with \\"A pain that I'm used to\\", their strongest song in years. Nobody ever thought that a mature band could sing and play with such energy, and so well. <br />\\"John the revelator\\" takes us to Martin's deepest obsession for religion, blended with Dave's best vocalization in the album. Purely  emotional. <br />\\"Suffer well\\" makes Dave's debut as a songwriter in a Depeche album, and in a wonderful way. Perhaps the fact of singing words of his own (and some collaborators) made him truly believe what he is saying. Essential. <br />Nothing but excitement and passion continues in \\"The sinner in me\\".  Electro sounds mixed with a desperate guitar, haunting vocals and deep lyrics. <br />Precious. The well-anticipated first single appears as the track number five. There's no much to say about it:  elegant, deep, emotional... classic depeche sound. <br />Here we finish with the first part of the album. Excellent, there is no other word to describe it. <br />There is a bridge between first and second part of the set, \\"Macro\\". Martin on vocals. Stripping himself, letting come out his thoughts, his emotions, his weaknesses. A different song. A perfect bridge. <br />The ghost of \\"Waiting for the night\\" gets into Playing the Angel. Second incursion of Dave on vocals, he \\"Wants it all\\". Fantastic. <br />\\"Nothing is impossible\\" takes us to the depressive world of Depeche Mode. The depressive world that marked a whole generation. <br />The next song is \\"Introspectre\\", it leads us into a mysterious path, a brief loss of consciousness. <br />The album gets darker, and in that saddarkness we find Martin singing again, depressive sounds and voices, but a light shines at the end, this light is \\"Lilian\\". A bright light that pops up like trying to tell us there is a solution of it all, a reminiscence of the eighties. <br />Well used to happy and emotional endings, we arrive eager for listening to the last track of the album, \\"The darkest star\\". A good song, without any doubt, but perhaps the the album deserved something bigger.  <br /> <br />Instead of repeating the same formula that made them superstars, Depeche Mode show us that their creative strength continues intact. Many comparisons among fans with previous albums appear. But it seems as if they haven't realised of something. Since Violator, Depeche Mode have been creating completely different albums. That is something that deserves respect and recognition, and makes of DM the definite biggest band on earth. Other comparisons with bands of the 90's (e.g. Nine inch nails) just reflects that these people don't know who gave birth to NIN's sound. <br /> <br />Yes, Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />This is not the way a 25 year-old band should sound. Fresh, mature, and grandiose. <br />I highly recommend purchasing \\"Playing the Angel\\", one of the best albums of our times.  <br />
0553573411|5.0|This is the second book in The Farseer Trilogy, and is my personal favorite.  Hobb's characterization is superb, and her plot is continually interesting.  Read this book. You won't regret it.
B00005JNJV|1.0|I copied this review cause the guy who wrote it besically took words out of my mouth so read below. <br /> <br />This movie is terribly bad (while not as bad as the detestable \\"Batman & Robin\\"). It is also full of inconsistencies with the 1989 film. For instance, in this movie Commissioner Gordon gets to know Batman, even though in the original film he didn't; the Commissioner invents the batsignal, which was a \\"present\\" from Batman at the end of the first movie; Bruce Wayne's parents were not murdered by the man who would become The Joker, but by an unknown criminal (as in the comics); and The Joker appears to exist already at the end of the movie, while the in the 1989 film we get to see him before he becomes the Clown Prince of Crime. Also, the Batmobile is the worst I have ever seen, and the villains are nothing but secondary characters. Ra's Al Ghul is a global menace in the comics, but here his goal is conveniently focused on Gotham City only, and the Scarecrow, one of Batman's most dangerous enemies, was wasted here, with only a few appearances, all without a scarecrow suit (he uses only a lame mask). All in all, I didn't like this movie one bit, and don't recommend it at all. If you want to see a good \\"Batman\\" movie, I suggest you watch the first original 1989 version.

0307276902|5.0|I have learned that while I am not the biggest fan of Oprah all the time, she does pick good books to read.  Let me start by saying that when I read, I also visualize so as he was describing his condition and the physical things that he was going through, I could picture it like it was a movie or a photo.  From those images, it made me aware and a little more sympathetic for what an addict goes through.  I know that this is only his story and every addict's story is different but the physical damage that was done to himself alone makes me glad and grateful that I have never tried drugs.  It was a great book and I loved meeting the different people that he met on his journey through rehab and I am looking forward to reading his other book \\"My Friend Leonard.\\"
B00005JMAH|5.0|I thought this movie was much better than the theater version because the deleted scenes add so much back into the plot from the book.  Also, the games and interviews are well done and entertaining.
B00005QXDD|5.0|Very few cds can make me laugh and simultaneously get a good song stuck in my head - one that I'm overjoyed to have lodged in my cranium for the remainder of my life.  This cd hasn't got a bad track on it, with the obvious exception of the non-musical selections, which are a nice breather from the hard, heavy, extreme style of their music.  I love the songs for what they are - really good songs.  I love the lyrics for what they are - really really funny.  For me, this is the perfect combination.  I would highly recommend this to just about anyone (with the exception of those who fear being rocked hard).  If you dislike swearing in music, this will be the cd that changes your mind.  Almost every song has lots of swear words, and they greatly enhance the music.  Humor in music is vital, and Tenacious D does it better than anyone else.

B000AXSN5G|2.0|I am sorry to say that given its hype and critical <br />accolades, to these ears, Prairie Wind is a major <br />disappointment.  I do not consider an album classic where  <br />I only enjoy three of its ten songs:  \\"The Painter\\",  <br />the lovely \\"Only A Dream\\" and the subtle \\"Falling Off  <br />The Face Of The Earth.\\"  <br /> <br />To these ears, the horns simply do not work, cluttering rather <br />than blending and complementing.  \\"No Wonder\\" is singlehandedly <br />ruined by overwrought and thoroughly unnecessary backing vocals. <br />However, none of the songs truly stick out, and the Elvis <br />tribute is merely a cute throwaway.   <br /> <br />Also, to these ears, Neil's acoustic music is at its best <br />when using sparse arrangements, and Prairie Wind is simply <br />overproduced.  In fact, I find a few songs from 2000's Silver <br />And Gold -- \\"Razor Love\\", \\"Silver and Gold\\", \\"Red Sun\\" and  <br />\\"Distant Camera\\" -- far more closer to the Harvest feeling <br />than anything on Prairie Wind.   <br /> <br />Perhaps I may feel different after 20 listens, but <br />after five, Prairie Wind is already gathering far more <br />time on my shelf.
B000001E3V|5.0|What could have happaned had Duane Allman not died, would The Allman Brothers have been better, would Derek And The Dominos have made another album? Who knows, but this is a album that makes me ask that question every time I hear it. Duane's amazing slide guitar playing is taken to a whole nother leavel on this album, solos that were mind blowing in the studio are taken to other worlds here and stretched across the universe in a mind blowing experince. Then there is the man, Eric Clapton, the one who makes guitar playing what it is. I have never heard that man play with such passion and angst and fire as he did when he was with Derek And The Dominos, and hearing him live is a whole nother experince.<br /><br />Discs one and two could have been their own live albums, because of length and quality of music. Disc one open up with the blues classic 'Got to Get Better In A While.' Which is a great way to open the album because it shows you what the rest of the album is going to be like, amazing! the next two songs 'Why Does Love Got To Be So Sad' and 'Key To The Highway' were both on the bands studio album Layla And Other Assorted Love Songs and they are done beautifuly here especially their cover of 'Key To The Highway' which they always make their own. Skip ahead one and 'Have You Ever Loved A Woman' is pure deep powerful blues that was also on the bands album. Go back one track and you get the solo-Eric Clapton classic 'Blues Power' which is one of the mans all time best songs, and here it is performed the very best I ever heard it. Disc two closes with another Eric Clapton classic and one of my all time personal favorites 'Bottle Of Red Wine' which is to me one of the best songs ever created.<br /><br />Disc two more powerful then the first, opening with my favorite Derek And The Dominos song, 'Tell The Truth' which is the perfect song to me and here is pulled off flawlesly. Eric and Duane's intertwined guitars are amazing and the bouncing chords on the organ add an amazing touch to the song here. Next is another heavy blues songs from the album called 'Nobody Knows You When Your Down And Out' which features some really intence playing! 'Roll It Over' and 'Presence Of The Lord' are two amazing songs that I heard for the first time hear and that truly have to be heard live to truly apreciate. The bands cover of Jimi Hendrix's 'Little Wing' is amazing live and in the studio but still falls just short of the original as Im sure all would agree. The album ends with the only semi-hit song on the album, Eric Claptons solo 'Let It Rain' which features one of his all time best solos normaly but is taken to knew heights live and reall must be heard by all guitar players! The album closes with the classic Cream cover of Robert Johnsons 'Crossroads' which is even better here then it is on Cream Wheels Of Fire. The perfect way to close this album as well as the legendary concert.<br /><br />For any live music fan this for you or for any Clapton and Allman fan this is a must have. So do Yourself a major favor and pick up this forgotten gem.an amazing touch to the song here.

B00005JNTX|3.0|All right, let me say right off the bat I'm not a fan of \\"dark\\" fiction.  I always find it both silly and a little predictable.  So if you like that dark stuff, go ahead and add a star to this review.  Maybe two.  As for me, it just didn't mesh together well. <br /> <br />WHAT I LIKED:  Marv, the psychotic maniac with a heart of gold.  His character, indeed his whole first story, made the film for me.  Truly an original character, Marv is struggling with mental illness.  He is ruthless, bereft of compassion for anyone that gets in his way.  At the same time, he's actually a pretty decent guy.  Despite his cruel nature I liked him a lot. <br /> <br />WHAT I DIDN'T LIKE:  The narration.  I can see it in a comic book, reading it, and even liking it.  But spoken aloud, even by talented actors, it sometimes comes across as cartoonish, even ridiculous.  Lines like \\"My Warrior Woman\\" just didn't work at all for me.  They even made me chuckle a bit. <br /> <br />The stories:  They're not bad, but they're all just simple variations of each other.  Scarred but noble men defending tarnished angels.  Only the first one held my attention all the way through (largely because of Marv).  The others were just weaker versions. <br /> <br />The violence:  I know it's supposed to be dark, but the violence in this film doesn't come across as scary and horrifying, but ridiculous and goofy.  A guy gets shot over a dozen times but doesn't die.  Somebody gets hit by a car not once, but twice, and just walks away.  Is this a looney tunes cartoon? <br /> <br />The extra \\"Dark\\" touches:  And of course, there's the over the top stuff that is just plain dumb.  A bad guy not only kills prostitutes, he eats them.  And not only does he eat them, he makes them watch him eat them.  Then he keeps their heads mounted on the wall.  Dark?  Please, that's just goofy. <br /> <br />MOST DISAPPOINTING:  Where were the extras?  Normally, I don't care about them on a DVD, but Sin City took a lot of technical muscle to translate onto film.  But there's not a making of doc or anything of the sort.  Just a little promotional film with actors and directors saying how much the respect each other.  Yawn. <br /> <br />FINAL THOUGHT:  I have to give Sin City a shrug in the end.  After watching the first story, there's not much point in going on except for some nice visuals. <br /> <br />But I really did like Marv.
B00005AQF7|5.0|Where can you start a review on this album, it is an absolute classic and maybe my favourite album of all time.  There is not a bad track on the album, it is one of the few albums i have, that i can listen through from start to finish without skipping a track.  The production on this album is amazing, in my opinion this is Dre's finest work in his career, and even 12 years on, it does not sound dated at all.  Unfortunately for Snoop, this album was so good that he could never hope to live up to this again, and people will always compare all his other albums to this, which is a bit unfair on him.<br /><br />As I mentioned when I listen to Doggystyle I never skip a track, everything on here is great.  My favourite tracks though would have to be, Gin & Juice which is one of the best songs of all time, Murder Was The Case, The Shiznit, Who Am I, Aint No Fun and Gz & Hustlas, all classics.<br /><br />Any self respecting hip-hop listener should really already own this, but if not you should get this album now, you won't know what your missing otherwise.
B00006LI4S|5.0|those of you who know roger waters's live DVD \\"In the Flesh\\" are in for a different kind of experience. <br />in a mostly acoustic, intimate show Gilmour gives his own new interpretations for some classic floyd jewels plus a rare performance of songs like \\"fat old sun\\" & \\"terrapin\\". <br />still a guitar virtuoso, Gilmour plays with precision & passion <br />&  sings almost as he did at the time when those songs were written. <br />if you're a floyd fan ,this one is a must!!! <br />if you're not,then i think that after you've bought this one, <br />the least you are going to be is a Gilmour fan. and that's a good start. <br />HIGHLY RECOMMENDED. <br />
B000002P7R|5.0|And then you finally get the album that has this music thats been out a while. Hendrix is a man with only 3 studio albums but everything else he did was outside of the experiance and all over the place with many musicians and concerts. Hendrix music is pure greatness in the rock and blues genre. He has lots of music other then his studio albums like South Saturn Delta, released many years after his death. Rare unreleased tracks that just plane rock like anything else hes ever done. some of his best work is on this album. Heck its probably even better then Axis: Bold as Love. Too bad he wasn't around for its release. He is truly one of the very best guitarist is rock and roll history. He will be remembered for all time to come. Jimi Hendrix is a guitar god and South Saturn Delta is a wonderful delight of music awesomeness! Listen to the whole darn thing loud and with open ears, because you're in for a treat.
B00008H2LB|1.0|I'm not quite sure how to express my opinion of this album without being too profane...calling it the worst piece of garbage since Limp Bizkit would almost be a compliment. It truly saddens me that this is what is passing for good music these days and worse over, I've seen LP listed in magazines as being 'metal.' Anyone who has heard the true metal like Priest, Maiden, Sabbath, Slayer, Pantera, Sepultura, or Megadeth likely pukes at the very idea of LP being considered 'metal.' <br /> <br />As far as the music goes, it is pretty much as bland as it gets. The guitar riffs are all down-tuned mindless three-chord drones that completely lack invention or ugency (and solos). Their hack of a guitarist makes The Edge (from U2) look like f***in' Jimi Hendrix by comparison. Continuing on, the bass is completely non-existant, which makes one wonder if the bassist just hangs around the band to look important and collect a paycheck. The drumming is absolute sub-par and does not go beyond anything but keeping a basic 4/4 beat (go listen to Neil Peart, Danny Carey, or John Bonham if you want to hear a REAL drummer). The samples are by far the most pretentious part of the music and are a poor attempt to make these songs a fusion of rap and rock. <br /> <br />I can usually get past lousy musicianship in bands if they can write meaningful, rockin' songs (The Ramones were masters of rock 'n roll simplicity), but LP is forever crippled by the ultra-stupid, pointless lyrics and raps of Chester Bennington and that Shinoda fool. Bennington wails like a teenage girl after going through a junior-high school breakup and Shinoda thinks he's totally badass for ripping off Zack de la Rocha and SA Martinez in each of the songs' magically timed rap sections. <br /> <br />If there is one thing that I truly hate in songs, it is self-loathing lyrics. Yes, everyone has problems...but how many people really want to hear about them? In the past five years, LP have become millionaires, yet still bemoanhow hard their lives are. Yeah, traveling the world, making millions of dollars and playing huge concerts must really be the drags (can you hear my sarcasm?) <br /> <br />Rap-rock music is not the problem; rap-rock can work, just listen to 311, Rage Against the Machine, Faith No More, etc. The problem with this band is lack of interesting or dynamic music, whiny lyrics and just the overall corporate image they project. <br /> <br />\\"Meteoria,\\" and \\"Hybrid Theory\\" are two of the worst albums in the history of rock. One star is too good of a rating, but the webpage won't let you do zero stars. Take comfort in knowing that this band will eventually be forgotten 20 years from now and their 'nu-metal' will just be a bad memory.
B000002L9M|5.0|This is, without a doubt, Depeche Mode's masterpiece.  VIOLATOR may be instantly more appealing with its wonderfully catchy synth beats and dark vibes, but BLACK CELEBRATION *is* Depeche Mode.  A previous reviewer was correct:  this album concerns sex and death--but mostly sex.  Let's move on to the songs, shall we? <br />1. \\"Black Celebration\\" ~ What a stunning opener!  It sets the tone and mood perfectly! Seques nicely into the following track...   10/10 <br /> <br />2. \\"Fly on the Windscreen\\" ~ Deliciously dark, VERY pulsing, and frantic, this song advances the mood:  although we may die tomorrow, we have love/lust to pass the time before then.  9/10 <br /> <br />3. \\"Question of Lust\\" ~ Martin's voice is strong and rich in this not-so \\"fragile\\" song.  The synthesizers work extremely well, as well.  Lovely song altogether.  10/10 <br /> <br />4. \\"Sometimes\\" ~ A short piece often compared to \\"Somebody.\\"  I *love* the lyrics, and the distorted backround voices combined with the piano give this song an eerie, sweet quality.  8/10 <br /> <br />5. \\"It Doesn't Matter Two\\" ~ Starts with an odd, almost \\"gothic\\" synthesizer and continues with devastating lyrics concerning...you guessed it...sex.  9/10 <br /> <br />6. \\"Question of Time\\" ~ Another frantic, frenetic track about protecting a young innocent from seedy sex fiends...or something to that effect.  8/10 <br /> <br />7. \\"Stripped\\" ~ Another sizzling track as you can guess by the title.  Strong, seductive vocals with lovely synths.  9/10 <br /> <br />8. \\"Here Is the House\\" ~ One of my favourites on the album.  I *love* the lyrics, and the beat is fantastic.  10/10 <br /> <br />9. \\"World Full of Nothing\\" ~ This marks the latter, more \\"dull\\" part of the album, in my opinion.  I've never been too fond of this song, primarilly because it's so repetitive and uninteresting, even though the lyrics are quite suggestive.  4/10 <br /> <br />10. \\"Dressed in Black\\" ~ I think of this as an early \\"One Caress\\" though it's far less interesting.  Not too bad, but not too interesting.  6/10 <br /> <br />11.  \\"New Dress\\" ~ I like this song, but it just doesn't fit with the rest of the album.  Every other song concerns sex and relationships, but this is just an overtly political song that should have been revamped and put on MUSIC FOR THE MASSES, for it sounds similar to \\"Nothing\\" in a way.  7/10 <br /> <br />12.  \\"But Not Tonight\\" ~ Next to \\"Somebody,\\" this is my favourite DM song.  Closes the album perfectly.  I can't imagine BLACK CELEBRATION without it.  The \\"night\\"--construe this metaphorically as you will--may be dark as are the preceding songs, but it is also beautiful and enjoyable.  10+/10 <br /> <br />In closing, I consider Depeche Mode to have reached a new apogee with BLACK CELEBRATION.  I recommend this brilliant, beautiful masterpiece to anyone who appreciates good music.

B000002KHF|5.0|I like to say that in 1971 I become musically aware.  I was into hard driving rock mainly, although I did like some of the softer C,S,N & Y stuff.  I only knew Van Morrison by Tupelo Honey and Brown Eyed Girl.  I put him in the Neil Diamond category. Ok to listen to at times, but I'd be embarrassed to tell my friends I liked him.  Too pop.<br /><br />Then recently I began to hear a song I had never heard.  And It Stoned Me.  I loved it and began to wonder if there was more to Van Morrison than I had been led to believe.  Saw this album in Borders under the \\"Classic Albums\\" category and picked it up.<br /><br />Wow!  What a great album!  Besides Stoned Me, I love Into the Mystic, Crazy Love and many others.  Glad its not to late for me to catch up on what made Van Morrison a great artist.
B00000K31Q|5.0|I have this movie and I liked it. I showed it too my niece and she loved it too, so I bought her one.  I will say that there is a lot of sex humor. If someone is going to buy it for a young teen, they might want to watch it first. <br />The price was good and free shipping was great, too.
0156027321|4.0|This story is unique. I don't recall reading anything like this before. At first it felt like information overload...but gradually the emotion, the feelings sunk in. Its a story of hope, of belief. Its sad, but it smiles. Its happy, but it cries. I must admit that at times I got lost (and almost bored) by details of all that happened at sea. Perhaps because I have never been on a big boat. I suppose I can't even tell the hull from the mast! But this is perhaps the only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of 5. Nevertheless, Yann Martel kept me interested...I couldn't put it down until Pi Patel had ****** (can't give it away, can I?). The end felt just a little anti-climactic, but then after Pi's epic journey, nothing could have been more exciting!<br />Do give this book a try!
B0006L5RT2|5.0|Absolutely beautiful album.  And, I mean e-v-e-r-y song.  This Brit has a very unique voice and range, sometimes sounding like a female.  My favorite all time album I never tire of.  I am sending cd's to my sisters!
B0002YLC24|5.0|\\"Before Sunset\\" is one of the most unabashedly romantic films I have ever seen.<br /><br />Even in our age of full disclosure and no privacy there remain moments that this viewer, anyway, has never seen captured on film before.<br /><br />\\"Before Sunset\\" captures some of those moments.<br /><br />Two adult characters converse. Watching them, you wonder -- and you know that these two characters are wondering the same thing -- where will this conversation go? Is it just an exchange of banal, prepackaged rants and scripts? But, the two characters keep talking, keep talking past rough moments, and awkward discomfort, and strange anecdotes.<br /><br />After a while of this, they come to say shockingly open and intimate things to each other.<br /><br />Before you realize that you've been swept off your feet, the conversation has become as intimate as the best sexual act could be.<br /><br />These two characters are using mere words to reveal hopes, and pains, and vulnerabilities, that we usually sweep from our consciousness, because the world has no room for them ... except during magical moments such as those dramatized in this film.<br /><br />There was one aspect of \\"Before Sunset\\" that didn't work for me. Ethan Hawke, especially, gives a poignantly visual performance. He says things with his eyes and face that he does not convey in words.<br /><br />Otherwise, though, this film is not visual enough to be fully satisfying as a film. Its charms and power are almost all verbal, all in the script. That being the case, \\"Before Sunset\\" would perhaps have been better as a radio play.<br /><br />The director cheats his audience; he doesn't care about using his camera to allow his audience to view Hawke, Delpy, their powerful and magic interaction, or Paris in a new and high impact way.<br /><br />But that's a minor complaint. \\"Before Sunset\\" swept this viewer off her feet. Days after viewing it, I'm still under its spell. It's appropriate that we understand spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language. What language does here is truly magic.d spells as being cast, primarily, with words, with language. What language does here is truly magic.
B00005JNJV|5.0|Pros <br />1. Christian Bale is a fantastic actor and is perfect for Batman. <br />2. Scripted and filmed much better than previous movies. <br />3.

0393327655|2.0|It seems that the world, according to Harris, is in a pickle.  The one great superpower has been highjacked by a right wing fundamentalist cabal that operates on religious \\"revelation\\" rather than reason and is utterly failing to deal with the great challenges of the day.  Harris correctly demonstrates at some length that both Christian, Jewish and Moslem religions are based on texts that claim unique knowledge of matters for which they have no evidence, and demand that non believers be converted or killed.  The obvious outcome - centuries of religious war, Inquisition, torture and execution, and a religious battle against science and modernity that continues to this day.  Religious moderates are moderate and tolerant primarily because they ignore the gorier aspects of their founding documents; but the worship that they accord those documents insures that new generations of fundamentalists will pick up those nastier aspects again and again, and sally forth into bloody battle.  Rather than attempt to salvage this irrational religious mess, we should junk the lot. <br /> <br />So what kind of better world would Harris build us, based on his vision of reason, and shorn of its ancient religious prejudices?  Well, he says that we must start by recognizing that the Muslim religion is uniquely evil (despite the crusades, the Inquisition, the Holocaust, trust me, the world's real problem is the Muslims), and the worst evil of all is - suicide bombers - despite the fact that their primitive technology kill far fewer than US bombs or the Israeli occupation.  The US and Israeli killings are mere \\"collateral damage\\", and our \\"good intentions\\" put us on an entirely different moral plain.  And of course, since the US and Israel are on such a unique and noble plain, we MUST use TORTURE to keep the Muslim hordes from using, are you ready for this one:  Weapons of Mass Destruction!!  Yes, I know, it's the US and Israel that have such weapons, not the Palestinians or the Iraqi insurgents, but never mind.  What are you waiting for, says Harris, for \\"a new sun to dawn over Los Angeles harbor?\\"  Here he almost directly steals the old Bush administration line:  do you want the smoking gun to be a mushroom cloud?  <br /> <br />So that would be the Harris Whitehouse - engaged as its primary task in a war against Islam, ignoring the usual \\"collateral damage\\" of thousands of Muslim civilians killed, manfully daring to use whatever torture might seem to be necessary, and taking solace in the wonderful \\"good intentions\\" of the US and Israel.  In other words, it would be exactly the same as the Bush Whitehouse, only instead of being \\"honeycombed with prayer groups and bible study cells\\", it would probably be pyramided with \\"meditation\\" groups, and consciousness raising study.  If you think I exaggerate, then check out Harris' dismal op-ed piece of 12/02/2004 \\"Mired in a Religious War\\" in the ultra right wing Washington Times, or the endorsement of his work by Alan Dershowitz, tireless propagandist for Israel and apologist for the use of torture.   <br /> <br />Harris proves that his version of reason can be almost as frightening as that old time religion.  <br />
0307276902|5.0|This book is a great read.  It is very raw and unreal.  I would tell everyone to buy this book.  James Frey gives you an excellent look as to what someone goes thru in rehab.  Mr. Frey shows you ever emotion possible.  You see the rage, sickness and crying.

B000002UJQ|5.0|The only reason so much backlash surrounds this album is because it is so acclaimed & adored by everyone. If it never had gotten the attention it did, all those same people who diss it would have shrines for it & pray to it daily. It's the elitist way of life. But if you are a person who's actually interested in music & not social status, I'd advise you to get a pair of headphones, put this in, sit back & let it take you. Headphones work best if you want to get the full affect of such an amazing experience. Creativity & muse leap boundlessly from song to song & suck you into it's sprawling sonic entrypoint. Each instrumentally eclectic song is a work of art all on it own. There are moments of such intense beauty (Namely: The climax of \\"Let Down\\", The bass line of \\"Lucky\\", etc.) that it's almost unbearable & will send chills pulsing through your body. I once again emphisize using headphones oppose to a stereo or a computer, & turn the volume all the way up. Ok?
B0002VKZL6|4.0|Some great songs on here.  Mostly understated and takes a couple of listens to appreciate in my opinion.  His guitar work and sounds up to his Mark's usual high standard and overall well worth adding to you collection.  <br /> <br />Oh I nearly forgot to mention the quality of Mark's vocals...superb!  Excellent recording overall.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Here is my feelings when i listen to it. <br /> <br />1st time :  Hmm....I'm not sure... Is this sound like Exciter again ?? <br />2nd time : OK.  Let's listen to it again and again <br />3rd time : Some tracks starting to grow on me... Oh ! there're 3 songs wrote by Dave ! (& Eigner)  <br />4rd time : I enjoy it a lot especially for first 3 songs is damn killer !! <br />5th-7th time :  Yes.  It is absolutely better than Ultra and Exciter.  It sounds more fresh and there're many thing that i was expected from With teetch (NIN) to be found here ! <br /> <br />My most favourite tracks for now. <br /> <br />1) A pain that i'm used to (Great opening tracks with some NIN sound, only this track can kill all   tracks from With teeth) <br />2) John the revelator (remind me of 'Some great reward' era) <br />3) Suffer well (Great tracks remind me a bit of 'A question of time') <br />4) Nothing impossible (Another great Dave's song) <br /> <br />All in all i listened to it in 5.1 sound syetem only !  This may be one of the main reason that i feel that the sound of this album is much more complex than their previous albums.  I have to confess that DM they are great as their age now, it is a very great album but i don't want to compare to 'Songs of faith' (my most favourite with a forever great DM's song 'In you room' i can't forget how great was it until now) as it is quite different era. <br /> <br />

No wait...he is.
B000B2YQX4|2.0|Depeche Mode has always been my favorite band.  However, I have noticed a gradual decline in song quality since Exciter.  Exciter had some really good tracks, but it had some notably bad tracks such as the biblically slow \\"Breathe\\" and \\"Comatose\\".  If you enjoyed the slow and uninspiring \\"Breathe\\" along with some of the slower selections from Martin's 2004 \\"Counterfeit2\\" lp, then you should buy this release.   <br /> <br />Precious is the strongest track this time out, but the rest pale in comparison.  It feels as though Martin is \\"hanging by a rope of mediocrity\\".   I advise bringing back either Tim Simenon or Alan Wilder.  Andrew Fletcher was right when he said that this was their best work since \\"Speak & Spell\\".
B00005JOGU|5.0|I remember reading \\"In Cold Blood\\" and finding it riveting. I read it all in about one sitting many years ago.  What I didn't realize when I read it, and seeing the movies made of it in between, was how much Capote identified with Perry Smith.  This revelation makes the movie worth watching in itself.   Capote says, \\"I feel like Perry and I grew up in the same house, he walked out the back door, and I walked out the front.\\"  I think the identification is what made the book so powerful.  Capote began the category of writing now known I guess as Creative Non-Fiction, but what still floors me, is how much he gave of himself in creating the masterpiece.  <br /> <br />Capote did become a washout insidiously after the completion of the book.  What higher price can one pay for creating a great work of art?  It seems to me, that the creative genius in him was hung with Perry Smith. <br /> <br />Incredible movie, a must see, I think.  I can't wait to buy it, and read the book again. <br /> <br />The movie is not for everyone, it deals with grim material.  Although, there were many strong performances, I doubt the Oscars will give it any recognition.  After all, the commercialization of Capote is what killed him too.

B00005MP58|4.0|I found the movie very very very good. It is exactly how I suppossed it to be. The perfect film version that could be made. The characters are perfectly chosen, I think Jane Austen would be very proud if she could see the movie. The only thing I shoud have changed a little, it would be the end. The whole movie shows everything in details, but only the end is a bit too fast for my taste. In one word: it is worth buying it!!!
B0006SSOHC|4.0|This movie is one of the best [Maybe the best] horror film from 2004. A demented killer who goes by the name of the jigsaw killer, Traps his victims [People who take their lives for granted] in difficult-to-escape death traps. His latest victims, A doctor [Cary Elwes] and a young man named Adam [Leigh Wannell, Who also is the screenwriter for this film] are trapped together in a mysterious run-down bathroom. Both of the guys are trapped in chains and are unable to leave. When they realize they've become the latest victims of the jigsaw killer, All hell breaks loose... This is a wonderful horror film that i would reccomend to all horror fans. This movie certainly has to be the best horror film that's been released in the 2000's so far. And, To top things off, This movie even has a clever ending that you'll never see coming. The plot is excellent, The acting is good, and The movie is actually more than just a whole bunch of murder scenes. Danny Glover [Showing up here as a former cop who lost his partner who's still in pursuit of the jigsaw killer out of vengeance] Turns in a good performance in this movie. If we had more horror films like this nowadays, The horror genre would be in great shape right now. Followed by a sequel, Which'll hit theatres this friday. Hope my review helped. Have a nice day, Be blessed. There is now an unrated version of this movie out right now.
B000059XUP|5.0|Great movie, still not surpassing Crow 1, but great. People should think of this as a story of it's own. It was never meant to replace the first one and no sequel ever will.     This film really makes the most honourable sequel to Crow 1. Buy this and watch it. The rest I'll leave to you.
B0009A1AS2|5.0|Less than two years after Dream Theater's not-so-incredible album, \\"Train of Thought,\\" was released in 2003, the progressive metal masters have returned with \\"Octavarium.\\" To me, it's really a remarkable achievement that DT made this disc 76 minutes flat, but it's even more incredible that, for this album, they put some metallic songs alongside ballads. Even though these Porcupine Tree-esque ballads (like track two--my personal favorite song on here--\\"Answer Lies Within\\") are much slower and gentler than the heavier songs, they are equally as powerful and don't kill the album's momentum. The album opener, \\"Root Of All Evil,\\" has a spacey beginning, but the propulsive guitars kick in and make this song semi heavy and crunchy. Next, the aforementioned \\"Answer Lies Within\\" is very soft and docile, with light strings, proper singing and even a few piano keys. This song is so pretty, it could pass as a Coldplay song. \\"These Walls\\" features limpid, almost childish singing over lurching, electric guitars, and \\"I Walk Beside You\\" is full of more good singing/crooning. Track five, \\"Panic Attack,\\" brings back a surge of grumbling guitars, and \\"Never Enough\\" has equally-as-crunchy riffs. \\"Sacrificed Sons\\" is a belated tribute to the 9/11 victims. It begins slowly, with pianos, but the beat eventually speeds up. Finally, the album concludes with the title track, which has a very slow and gradual build up. Some acoustic strums, a pretty string arrangement, and some guitar noodling eventually begin, however, and the song gains a bit of momentum. This album--like all Dream Theater albums--isn't for metalheads who are looking for a good headbanging, but I think all metal collections need some progressive metal, and (as \\"Octavarium\\" proves) nobody does this genre better than this band.
B000ANVPPQ|5.0|Paramount has done a great job with the four movies in their collection-island in the sky, the high and the mighty, mclintock, and hondo. I wish that the reviewers state if the copy they're reviewing is the paramount copy just released or the other vastly inferior copies. That way Paramount won't get a bad rap for dreck they didn't produce.

B00082IJ08|5.0|People don't usually review albums unless they feel strongly about them. The fact that the latest Gorillaz album has racked up almost 250 reviews (and it's only been out for a few months!) says something about the power of this album. It's been criticized for being too dark, too strange, and trying to incorporate too many artistic styles into the short span of an hour.  But these are only minor, debatable flaws in an otherwise incredible album.  <br /> <br />   What Damon Albarn & Co. specialize in is capturing the unease of the new millennium. We live in an increasingly uncertain world: al Qaeda, anthrax, overpopulation, global warming, the threat of nuclear war, and the effects of rapid technology and globalization.  Throughout Demon Days runs an edgy current mirroring the present times. Many reviews seem to miss the fact that Demon Days is politically charged.  \\"Kids with Guns\\" reflects the fear of school shootings, \\"O Green World\\" mourns the disaster of the environment, and \\"Dirty Harry\\" is blatantly anti-war, with a shot at President Bush (\\"So said the speaker/ With the flight suit on.\\")  This trilogy succeeds in delivering social commentary in the form of fantastic, diverse songs.  The restless, unsure drive of Demon Days doesn't let up there, and peaks at the spoken-word track \\"Fire Coming Out of the Monkey's Head,\\" which is quite possibly the strangest (and darkest) three minutes of the entire album.  But Demon Days' dark message is cleverly concealed on tracks such as the poppy dance hit \\"Dare\\" and the choral closers \\"Don't Get Lost in Heaven\\" and \\"Demon Days,\\" which sound deceptively innocent. <br /> <br />   Enough cannot be said about the top-notch musicianship on this  album.  Damon Albarn employs De La Soul, Shaun Ryder, and DJ Danger Mouse, among many others, and uses a variety of musical styles- including a children's choir on the brilliant single \\"Dirty Harry.\\"  With the current state of modern rock radio churning out repetitive three-chord garbage like Creed, Nickelback, and Linkin Park,  singles such as \\"Feel Good, Inc.\\" and \\"Dare\\" are a welcome, refreshing relief.   <br />  <br /> So far, this is one of the best rock albums of 2005. It's a concept album, almost, of unease and restless anxiety; a time capsule for the year 2005. But the full Gorillaz experience can't be had until you check out Jamie Hewlett's incredible videos. The Gorillaz are touring in 2007. See ya there!
B000000Y2F|4.0|Individual performances are first rate. Music selection could have been better as both of these artists have donbe marvelous work on other pieces.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|A friend of mine talked me into watching this show shortly before the film opened.  I borrowed their copy to humor them and was blown away by the show.  I bought my own copy the next day.   <br /> <br />The cast while having it's bumpy moments is on a whole amazing and the stories are both amusing and entertaining.  I wish the show had done well on Fox because one season is just not enough.
B00005JNJV|5.0|This is the most satisfying of the Batman movies.  No goofy villains or campy lines here.  This Batman has a great script, plenty of action and terrific acting.<br /><br />Liam Neeson, Michael Caine, Gary Oldman, Morgan Freemen, Rutger Hauer and of course Christian Bale.  These guys are professionals.  Even though many of the parts seemed minor, each actor makes their presence felt.  They make this the most realistic of the Batman movies.<br /><br />High marks for the director, Tim Nolan who got these wonderful performances from these excellent actors.  He really had a handle on his movie and it shows.  He allowed his actors to  become multi-dimensional people, not simply side-kicks to Batman.  In a good \\"period\\" piece, the director develops his characters slowly; in some cases leaving the viewer to ponder if they are good or bad or somewhere in-between.  Nolan manages to create this struggle in his characters and at the same time keep the action level high.<br /><br />The plot is far more intricate than other Batman movies too;  taking it from a comic book action movie to an action mystery.  Gotham is dark and forboding and the Batman is tough and sober about his mission.<br /><br />Side note:  the chase scene is probably the best I have ever seen.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Fox are a bunch of idiots to let this great series go to waste, Since there is practically no future for the show, atleast support the movie people..
0786715103|5.0|There are many books written on the Rwanda genocide, but General Dallaire's book is from the perspective that he was involved in the major decisions/ meetings and events.  You can't beat that perspective.  There is a little bit of that edge (I was there) in his writing and thoughts.  So much written, so much said, so many people working on this case... The General writes in the \\"where were you all when he, they, the UN mission, needed them\\". <br /> <br />3.5 million deaths in the DRCongo since, nothing has really changed. <br /> <br />-Good glossary in the back, you may want to reference that first and throughout.  <br />-The maps are a little weak in detail. <br />-A simple diagram splitting the 2 main political/military camps and the moderates/extremes would of been helpful.  There are many Rwandan names in many political parties and affiliated parties, so it is somewhat confusing to follow.  The book is fine for a \\"new to the Rwanda genocide\\" reader, but it is written somewhat from the perspective that you know a lot already from all the previous books and news. <br /> <br />As much as Universities/Colleges like to analyse these things and a full panal of experts worlwide and in at UN (they have 60 years experience under that name).  The bottom line as usual, and always has been: 200,000 people working on it but it is nobody's job to do.  Meetings-UN, writers making $$$ from books, news making $$$ on news, so much research from specialist.  The mission had 1 or 2 rounds of ammunitions left to defend or maintain the peace.  1 to 3 minutes of exchange and then they are sitting ducks...where is all the planning and meetings now. <br />All parties in the conflict know this is standard, they can't rely on the UN exclusively to maintain the peace.  Most of the major political moderates were killed the same day by the extremists even with UN protection. <br /> <br />It is far from all the US and France don't care about Africa, or the \\"other\\" Great Lakes area, in my opinion. <br /> <br />The UN is a mess and in a terrible no win situation.  Donors give and receivers take- the UN is in the middle playing politics and both sides are trying hard to create an unbalance to their advantage.   <br /> <br />In my opinion, the intentions at the UN are good, but the delivery is terrible- not only because the US or major donors aren't paying enough, the UN operations are a mess and donors can easily point that out.  Not providing more ammunition/rounds for peace keepers has little to do with the US or France, there will never be enough money.  General Dallaire's mission was probably the victim of other missions that took more than they should- still never enough however.  <br /> <br />African leadership is the main culprit, meaning it's just the way it is in Africa.  Politics is the main power game in town and many people want in.  Elitist politicians, many educated in French Canada in this case, that have nothing in common with the populace they serve.  They are involved in political organizations while studying, raising trouble for the sake of doing so.  These folks like the game, I'm not always so sure they like stability. <br /> <br />Both sides in Rwanda were using the UN mission as leverage.  The only UN-New York(HQ) information coming in to General Dallaire was: <br /> <br />-You want a Chapter 7 operation, 5000+ peace keepers.  Hallway politics are telling him ask for Chapter 6 and with little budget.  As soon as you have this type of hallway communication between all camps- say this to get that- communication is going to go astray and the only people losing here are the Rwandan people. <br /> <br />The UN (HQ) is thinking in terms of all their missions and the precedence Rwanda will bring for other missions.  All decisions and communication was clear, stay neutral, only if they really provoke can you take some action.  Both camps are trying to force the mission into a mistake to take advantage of the situation.  The General and the mission can't win on those terms.   <br /> <br />They played the game of staying neutral while clear violations were occuring that could of been easily avoided.  They are bound by the Chapter 6 UN rules and nobody knows that more than the waring parties.  They learn UN's moves off every mission also, this is military politics for them.      <br /> <br />The situations described in the book throughout are almost not believable. <br /> <br />-1 to 3 minutes of ammo. <br />-Troops arriving from various countries without any provisions- not accounted for in the theoretical budget.  People that have worked in the UN for too long say, that's not our problem.  It becomes the General's however.  African leadership taking advantage of the UN here again to their people's detrimend. <br />-Troops from some countries that are there seamingly for training purposes and to return home safely at the expense of Rwandans.  As far as sabotaging their vehicles/ operations to stay out of trouble. <br />-The Belgians...let's see.  They ask to go to Rwanda.  They fight in bars, low level flights on a joy ride, engaging fire from one of the parties thinking it's the enemy.  The local radio owner is detained at gun point because they don't like what they are saying about Belgians.  They stop and search Bogasora's vehicle as if they don't know who he is to piss him off.  That act alone could of caused the 10 lives of the Belgians more than anything else.  They used all the rounds of ammunitions during training.  A few soldiers disobeyed orders not to return to camp because of conflict on the road coming into Kigali.  Instead of spending one evening away, they had to return and cause a few deaths and in doing so showing the mission is not capable of protecting the peace. <br />-100 light armoured vehicles coming in from the Mozambique UN-mission- only 30 arrived at destination in somewhat working order with no mechanics and the radios stolen the previous night at port. <br /> <br />A lot of this is simple logistics, nothing to do with the US and not providing enough money.  Of course a lot/  most could of been avoided.  The UN was always one or a few steps back and costing (budget) more and in the process and obviously more than the budget. <br /> <br />These are the kinds of scenarios that actually happen while everyone is analysing and planning.  This is how things actually work out in reality on the lines. <br /> <br />Rush to sign a peace accord (I'm not saying this is bad), let a little time pass and try best to implement the peace keeping mission and hope everything works out. <br /> <br />Chapter 6 is maintain the peace, both parties in theory want peace.  But the political gaming is just starting with the UN in the middle as leverage.  If a party or both do not really want to respect the peace aggreement there is little that can be done.  It will go to the extreme as it did in Rwanda, shooting down a plane to cause caos.  ~\\"my troops are killing, but I can't control them their president was on that plane\\".  If it wasn't a plane it would be something else.  5000+ troops ready and fully willing could of avoided the genocide however according to many?? <br /> <br />If both parties really want peace, the UN shouldn't have difficulty in having the radio airwaves availiable for peace messages only.  Blackout on everything else. <br /> <br />The national guard should not have a problem with having UN troops withing their camps. <br /> <br />The Presidential guard same as above. <br /> <br />Local police same as above. <br /> <br />Politicians in the same quarters at all times with the UN. <br /> <br />Most of the mission was spent chasing down these politicians to communicate with them.  Trying to find out what the Presidential guard, gov't forces, police are up to.  Who are these interhamwe causing problems and especially who are they taking orders from.  The communications links should be under UN control, if the signing parties really want peace theysurly know this is needed themselves.  Everyone has got an eye on everyone and communication is moving the peace operation forward...in an ideal situation.
0767903862|5.0|Bill Bryson is a fantastic travel writer, probably the funniest travel writer out there. His wry comedic style and self-depricating humor make him as much a part of his travel narratives as the places he visits. His ability to find interest in the mundane, absurdity in the commonplace, and value in almost every aspect of his travels is wonderful. He has a particularly amusing knack for describing people, both historical figures and people he meets along the way. He has a great appreciation for the eccentricities of human behavior. He also seems to thrive on describing in great detail all the dangers of the world-things that could maim and/or kill you. While he has a great love for nature, he's also quick to point out that nature, more often than not, wants to kill and eat us. These make Australia perfect for Bryson. It's a land of eccentric people and dangerous animals and landscapes. It's like the entire country was made for Bryson's talents.<br /><br /> Bryson wanders well off the well-worn tourist trail, visiting small towns and unheard-of museums along the way. But in truth it doesn't matter where he goes because he could describe dirt for thirty pages and it would be entertaining. Still, his timing is perhaps his greatest strength. Just when you might be tiring of his day, he interjects some history or some interesting facts. He knows exactly how much is enough and not too much. While this isn't my favorite Bryson (A WALK IN THE WOODS), it's certainly right up there at the top. And I have yet to read anything by him that I didn't like. I was only in Australia once for a short time, but everything Bryson says rings true, and it makes me want to go back.
0762412992|5.0|This is a beautifully illustrated book of the classic story.  Wonderful to share with the entire family and a great excuse to start a new tradition at this holiday season.
1400079179|3.0|I don't understand the overwhelming popularity of the book. There are interesting theories presented (and if not supported by actual research, then Brown has done a wonderful job of fabricating evidence to back them) but the theories are wrapped in a thin plot that does little more than move us from one location to another so the main character can give lectures. Without going into too much detail, the story goes that Leonardo Da Vinci, among other great minds throughout history, belonged to a secret society that watched over the secrets of the Holy Grail. Da Vinci hid in his paintings many clues to the true meaning of the Grail. Interesting. And I probably would have enjoyed a non-fiction book about those theories.<br /><br />But to be fair, this is a work of fiction, never intended to be non-fiction. Even at that though, it only mildly succeeds. The characters are poorly developed, the writing does nothing more than advance the plot, the dialogue is bad and the constant use of italics to convey the thoughts of the characters is irritating, as is the use of cheap and tired plot tricks to build suspense. As a cat-and-mouse crime caper, I've read better (James Patterson to name one author, if those are your kind of books). Overall, the book felt small to me. The timeframe, the storyline, the resolution--none of it lived up to the hype. Interesting premise, but the execution is probably suited more for a movie than a book.
6305079811|5.0|Let me set the scene:  J-Abs and Nook are enjoying a cold one talking about this cult classic when no other than Sam Jones himself walks up to us commenting on how cool we were and how we have the laydays at our disposal.  So he goes on to tell  us that Ming had a son and that he was planning on destroying Earth as revenge for his father.  So of course we are sitting there as the ladies are wrapped around us begging us to save the world going hey we got nothing planned tonight and it is a nice night for space travel.  So Nook calls up former Kansas City Royals Buddy Biancalina and Steve Balboni (who act as Zarkoff and the main bird man) and we take a little trip to Mongo to take care of this chump.  So as we arrive we notice that Ming's son Ring Ring has all these beauitful women around him and Nook tells me that he will go the 1st 2 rounds with Ring Ring while I keeps the ladies happy.  After Nook initial barrage of DDT's and Hogan leg drop he tags to J-Abs and kepps the ladies company.  J-Abs then basically went into finishing move after finishing move which started with the powerbomb and ended with a Figure four led lock while Nook had him in the camel clutch at the same time.  After disposing of Ring Ring we decided that these chicks were too weird for us and we headed back to earth to let the laydays at the bar know just how darn good we are.  Balboni and Biancciala wanted to get in on some of the action but we told them there services were no longer needed and that there was plenty of Nook and J-Abs to go around.  Don't thank us for saving the planet and don't be mad when your women leave you for the Rock N Roll Express!!!  whoooooooooooooooooooooooo!!!!

0060082569|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this story on a recent family trip across country.  I was surprised when my wife, who is usually not interested in war stories, became immersed in the book. I only wish it was available in CD-Rom format.
B0007P3582|2.0|Even though 50 cent isn't a great MC i still expected much more on this album.  Infact, i can't even lie but his first album \\"Get Rich or Die Tryin\\" was actually a really good CD.  50 has gone further down the Ja Rule path, singing on almost every track and trading in much of the gangsta imagery which made him popular in the first place for a ladies man persona.  He should have named this album \\"Get Rich and Stop Tryin'.\\" A lot of Fifty's songs are deriviative of himself.  Nothing on the album is outstanding even Eminem's guest appearance is lack luster.  If you absolutely must have some Aftermath gangsta ish pick up The Game or Young Bucks.  Avoid this album if you can.
B000777J2S|5.0|'I am a bird now' is the most stunning album I have heard in 20 years plus - I had completely forgotten how music can make you feel more alive and more aware of how much beauty there is in the world.  Antony's voice is the voice of an angel - he trenscends the usual male/female, black/white boundaries and offers a sound so unique and ethereal that it is literally breathtaking.  The songs are beautiful - intelligent and carefully crafted whilst the musicianship of the Johnsons is superb.  Ultimately it is Antony's voice and humanity which haunt you long after you have finished listening. It is no exaggeration to say that this album is life changing.
0800177177|1.0|This movie holds a special place in my heart as \\"most fun to mock\\". I don't even know where to begin on how bad it is. Let's start with the acting: Keanu Reeves gives one of the worst performances ever captured on film. For extra fun, watch him while he's not talking. \\"Should I make a facial expression now? Yes... maybe... no, false alarm. Oh, hey, I have a line coming up... concentrate... English accent... NOW!\\" Winona Ryder is unremarkable. Anthony Hopkins sinks his teeth into the cheesiness of the movie with an enthusiastic \\"JAH!\\", and is a pleasure to watch. Gary Oldman gets an enthusiastic \\"eh\\". <br /> <br />Sure, it's a beautiful movie, but high production values do not make the script or the acting any more tolerable. Plus, the directing from Francis Ford Coppola is so overly artsy and pretentious you'd think he was fresh out of film school. <br /> <br />There were a lot of unnecessary sexual elements in this: the pointless nudity, the lesbian kiss, the bestiality. This movie claims to be faithful to the original text, but one of the major plot points, **spoiler** Mina and Dracula falling in love and getting \\"redeemed\\" at the end, **end spoiler** wasn't even in the book, and is so contrived it will have you slamming your head against the nearest blunt object. <br /> <br />I'll admit it, I bought the movie, but only because my vicious rampages against it made my friends want to see it. That's the only concievable reason I can see buying this movie, really: to watch, and mock, and laugh.

B000A0GP4K|5.0|This CD is an absolute must for Dylan fans.  Martin Scorsese does a masterful job over 3 1/2 hours of old film clips of Dylan on his way up from humble Minnesota beginnings to international pop icon. It covers his life chronologically from those early days to 1966 when he had his motorcycle accident.  Absolutely mesmorizing. There are old home movies of his hometown of Hibbing Minnesota, and the influences along the way that shaped Dylan into the premier spokesman of his generation. Influences like Woody Guthrie, old bluesmen, Bobby Vee and many others.  His early New York folk singer days with Von Ronk, Joan Baez, Clancy Brothers and more, paint a vivid picture of what the New York folk scene was in the late 50's and early 60's.  One fascinating segment was how the \\"suits\\" at Columbia Records were scratching their heads at John Hammond's recommendation of signing him up on that label in 1962. A label that had Johnny Mathis, Tony Bennett and Doris Day and Mitch Miller as head honcho. He revolutionized how songs were written and how songs were sung.  It covers his conversion to electric guitar and all the backlash, especially the 1966 Royal Albert Hall Concerts where the British described his new sound as \\"Rubbish!\\"  This is just too much to write about. Just buy it. It will go down as one of the finest pop culture documentaries ever made.  An outstanding job by Scorsese!
B00008H2LB|5.0|Linkin Park's second album (not including remix collection \\"Reanimation\\") expands their sound to all new areas. \\"Foreword\\" is a very short track that makes an interesting introduction to the introduction of break-up grinder \\"Don't Stay.\\" \\"Somewhere I Belong\\" is a self-pity/teen-angst track with Linkin Park's notably popular mix of rock and rap layered perfectly. \\"Lying From You\\" begins with an organ-like sound and leads into rapping verses and a screaming chorus. \\"Hit the Floor\\" finds the band leaning toward the rap side of their mix a little more, but not to disappoint fans, it's Linkin Park, for sure, and the chorus will surely remind them of that. A softer side of Linkin Park is found on \\"Easier to Run,\\" a song with a melodic vibe and an intricate percussion pattern. \\"Faint\\" kicks off with a string arrangement and the hard-hitting message \\"Don't turn your back on me, I won't be ignored!\\" The band further expands their sound with \\"Figure.09\\" a song focusing on expectations gone wrong. \\"Breaking the Habit\\" is an extremely notable track, with a catchy rhythm and a level of melody never before seen by the band. \\"From The Inside\\" is a track that will stick in the minds of listeners...and they'll love it! \\"Nobody's Listening\\" may sound a little strange, starting off with a Japanese flute solo, and moving into extremely rappy verses. Fear not, the chorus will bring it all together. The instrumental, \\"Session\\" is a track with Linkin Park's usual rap/rock mix, and is very well-done for an instrumental track. The album closes with \\"Numb,\\" which has an excellent hook and a message about stuggling to please an authority figure.
B00005JNJV|3.0|I just saw the movie again, and frankly, I was a little disappointed. <br /> <br />If you're anything like me, the first time you see this movie, you'll come away thinking it's a definite improvement over some of the recent installments -- particularly the Scharzenegger/Uma Thurman dud.  Christian Bale makes an excellent Batman, the back story about how he becomes Batman is plausible and well told, his relationships with Ducard (Liam Neeson), with Alfred (Michael Caine), and Rachel Dawes (Katie Holmes) are real, and his emotional torment convincingly conveyed.  Some of the scenes are great -- particularly the exposition about how he becomes Batman -- the most lust you'll see in this movie is when he sees the future Batmobile for the first time, and you'll be right there with him.  Also, the director gets the iconic Dark Knight look just right.  When Rachel Dawes meets Batman for the first time, you'll know what I mean. <br /> <br />So why doesn't the movie have staying power (ie -- why didn't it hold up so well after a second viewing?)  There are several reasons.  The dialogue is actually pretty didactic -- justice v. vengeance, face your fear, etc. etc.  Second, there really is no drama -- you know what this story is going to be before you go into the movie theatre, you're going for the action, the scenery, and the details, so in a way, it's kind of boring.  Third, it's emotionally pretty one-dimensional.  This Batman is focused, and neither love, nor money, nor a good time, are going to get in his way. <br /> <br />Don't get me wrong, I liked this movie, and I think it had better than average entertainment value, but like this DVD (which really has no special features), it's a limited pleasure.
B00005JKG7|4.0|John Carpenter's \\"The Fog\\" is a worthy follow-up to his horror masterpiece, \\"Halloween.\\"  While nowhere near as terrifying or as polished as the first Michael Meyers tale, \\"The Fog\\" offers up several treats for horror fans in addition to some genuine scares. <br /> <br />There may not be a better opening to a horror film.  A bunch of kiddies sit by a campfire late at night on the beach as old, grizzled John Houseman spins a yarn about the ghosts of a lost ship that foundered off this very same coastline exactly 100 years ago.  Not one of those kids slept a wink after that tale, rest assured. <br /> <br />It appears that this old tale is true . . . 100 years ago, a wealthy local man sought to found a leper colony nearby (he had caught the disease as well), and this didn't appeal to the local villagers.  So six of them used a campfire to lure the shipful of lepers onto the rocks at night, causing the shipwreck and the loss of all hands.  Being civic-minded scoundrels, the six murderers then stole the wealthy leper's gold and founded the town of Antonio Bay, which now celebrates its centennial. <br /> <br />Carpenter and his \\"Halloween\\" collaborator Debra Hill build on this excellent story foundation by assembling one heck of a cast.  Jamie Lee Curtis (given the immortal line, \\"Bad things seem to happen near me\\"), Adrienne Barbeau, and Janet Leigh all feature in \\"The Fog,\\" as does the aforementioned Mr. Houseman and also Hal Holbrook as a tormented pastor.   <br /> <br />Carpenter and Hill also create a great look for \\"The Fog.\\"  Shot in 1980, the special effects are low-tech, but that is part of the appeal.  Unable to capitalize on today's CGI effects, Carpenter's team used wit and talent to create some terror out of primitive special effects, a fog machine, and some lamps.  Believe me, it works. <br /> <br />The story's execution is a bit weak.  While there are many intriguing setups (Ms. Barbeau's radio station is perfectly situated on a precarious cliff overlookingthe ocean, where she can watch the fog roll into town while screaming warnings over the radio and also placing her in dire peril), there is a lot of silliness, too.  Jamie Lee Curtis gets picked up as a hitchhiker by a local, and before you know it we see them in bed post-coitus . . . and *then* they introduce themselves.  Ms. Barbeau also makes some rather quick leaps to the correct deduction that the fog is lethal.  And a dead seaman lurches to his feet to attack an unsuspecting victim in a hospital . . . but somehow misses and falls inert to the floor, and nobody says anything other than \\"you okay\\"?  Hmmm.   <br /> <br />There's also a bit of concern over the tale of vengeance.  The story veers from the fog (and its ghosts) taking out anyone who comes into contact with it to a tale of exacting specific revenge against the descendants of the six murderers who lured the leper ship to its doom.  The story has trouble deciding.  (Although it's nice to see that the fog has remained current on technical matters, being able to take out phone lines and power generators -- it's silly, but does help create the proper tension.) <br /> <br />\\"The Fog\\" is easy to dismiss after 25 years with its low-tech special effects, its story holes, and the incredibly weak music selection of the local deejays.  But it gets certain things exactly right -- the creepy look of fog sweeping in off the ocean, the terror of opening the door and looking out into the murk, and the haunting soundtrack of Mr. Carpenter.  (Perhaps its not as famous as the \\"Halloween\\" score, but it should be.)   <br /> <br />Maybe people in sunny, arid climates can laugh off \\"The Fog\\" as a silly, unworthy follow-up to \\"Halloween.\\"  Maybe.  But in Portland, Oregon, we get our fair share of foggy nights, and I can guarantee that the next time I'm out in the fog, I'm going to be looking over my shoulder.  That's a calling card of a good horror flick!
B00005JOGU|5.0|The Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences may as well just serve up Phillip Seymour Hoffman's Oscar now, for without a doubt, his performance in Capote is the finest of the year. Hoffman becomes so absorbed in playing the famous author, that he's sure to have a lock on the admiration of viewers everywhere, and the gold statuette.    He's nothing short of astonishing, and he never overly imitates the well known, and often mocked, speech patterns or mannerisms of the writer Truman Capote, but rather nails his essences without turning to parody. But the film itself is absolutely mesmerizing, a beautiful, subtle, and beguiling tale, of love and art and journalism; it's terrific movie that thoroughly deserves all the accolades.     The film begins in the late '50s when Capote, fresh off the success of Breakfast at Tiffany's. He's now become part of the intellectual and artistic elite, a doyen of the salons and private parties of the Upper East Side and secure in his world and reputation as the New Yorker's best and brightest author.     One afternoon he reads a short newspaper article in The New York Times about the slaying of a rural Kansas family, the Clutters. Something about the gravity of the murders captivates him, and Capote decides the topic is perfect for The New Yorker magazine, an article in which he will show the effect of such a brutal murder on the inhabitants of a small town.    Within days he heads to the community of Holcomb, Kansas in the company of his boyhood chum, Harper Lee, (a fabulous Catherine Keener), soon to write her one and only novel, To Kill a Mockingbird. Lee serves as his enabler, helping Capote ingratiate himself into the close-knit, and somewhat intolerant, community, as he attempts to make contact with the town's law enforcement professionals and, ultimately, the perpetrators of the deed.    As the narrow minded law enforcement officials, led by Alvin Dewey (Chris Cooper) reluctantly give Capote information about the crime, the young reporter befriends one of the imprisoned convicts, Perry Smith (Clifton Collins Jr.) in order to extract as much of his personal perspective about the killings as possible.     But it's a relationship forged in dishonesty - it's the story and not the lives of the murderers that really compel the author - and whilst there's obviously an attraction there - they're both eccentric outsiders from the wrong side of the tracks - Capote is shown as ultimately more concerned about getting the story, as he does his best to postpone Perry's execution until he can get all the information that he needs. He must find out exactly what happened on that night in 1959, and he does such a good job of manipulating Perry's trust so that Perry believes he has a friend who will fight for his life.     Director Bennett Miller, writer Dan Futterman, and most of all actor, Philip Seymour Hoffman capture this process with exquisite accuracy and with the smallest of flourishes. The genius of the film, besides Hoffman's stunning performance, is that it knows exactly how much is enough. It never overplays, lingers or punches up.     The dialogue is intelligent; each scene is carefully laid out, with a gorgeously minimalist piano score that heightens the emotional tension between the characters. Meanwhile, the gray ominous sky and the flat, severe landscape of Kansas, the horizon a hundred miles out, lends its own atmosphere to the proceedings.     Did Capote eventually fall in love with Perry? Perhaps, but you leave the film with a definite sense that Capote's feelings towards the condemned man were enigmatic at best, he was a man torn between finding the story and his very real concern for the fate of another human being. Capote is presented here, flaws and all, as someone rather despicable, but he was also quite sensitive. The anguish he suffers at the results of his decisions emerges as our only glimpse of his potential redemption.     Capote is a stunning film, and a superb drama, as itmines one of man's darkest moral dilemmas - that of gaining and using another's trust for mostly selfish motivations. Much of the complication comes not only from the acknowledgement of guilt by the perpetrator, but also by the genuine feelings of concern and empathy that Capote develops for Perry, and he discovers that can't easily reconcile these feelings with his cold and calculated objective.     The supporting players are exceptional, particularly Keener as Harper Lee and also Bruce Greenwood as author, Jack Dunphy, who was also Capote's partner and lover. But, without diminishing the contributions of all Capote's participants, this is really Hoffman's film. He's an absolute delight. Truman Capote was a complicated, competitive and totally driven man, a literary genius who had many demons, and Hoffman conveys all sides of him to perfection, letting you see the man behind the glasses, the effeminate voice, and the pouting often arrogant humor.

0307276902|3.0|I think the story in the book is very interesting. I have also been through treatment, so I liked reading about it.  I have some different beliefs as I believe that the 12 steps of AA are very important.  I just don't like to have the F- word used so many times.  I don't say it and don't like to read it.  I felt it was excessive.
0517548232|4.0|DISCLAIMER: This review will not be helpful in determining whether to purchase this product.    I must comment that I find the dialogue between hard-line libertarians and hard-line socialists to be very amusing!  I mean... libertarians speak as though the game is over and they have \\"won\\" in that the correctness of their theory has been fully confirmed.    The ancient Greeks during the period of the Athenian empire were the proponents of the most archetypal (and one of the earliest) forms of democracy.  Imagine if, after the Peloponnesian war and the fall of the Athenian empire to a Spartan puppet state, someone had declared that democracy was a failed experiment! The course of history certainly does not bear out that presumption.  I hear echoes of this sentiment among the hard-line right wing, who speak as though the entire course of human history has culminated in modern times and has now been vindicated in the form of democracy.    The socialists don't fare any better.  The arguments against them are grounded in such common sense and indisputable fact that they scarcely need to be listed.  People like to own stuff.  Plus, J. M. Keynes still owes me $2... the cheapskate.    The fact is that socialism is an inevitability in a world where the ever-increasing world population renders individual choice more and more meaningless.  As powerful as a relatively few individuals may become, those few will always depend on the masses more than vice versa.    Marx and Engels foolishly sought to bypass the democratic/free-enterprise/industrial step in economic development, and in so doing rendered their brand of socialism ineffective and that school of thinking has taken on an air of anachronism.  You can't side-step the aformentioned phase in socio-economic development any more than you can side-step learning to add before attempting to multiply!  Before the proletariat has any reason to overtake the plutocratic \\"haves\\", they must be beaten down and humiliated for generations.I am personally neither a socialist or libertarian.  I am an observer who tends to shy away from systematic doctrine simply because it is useless in explaining such ineffable phenomena as human choice and behaviour.  I respect those economists who embrace the chaotic nature of such phenomena and attempt to use them to their advantage.    I just ordered this book from Amazon, and I can't wait to read it! Perhaps the game isn't over just yet.    EDIT:  Having read the book many times over now, I have to say I am truly impressed.  It is much more unbiased than you might assume.  If I could change my rating it would easily get 5 stars.
6305718954|5.0|...but don't be put off by the reviews of others who seem to have an axe to grind against this movie.      The synopsis is simple enough.  Frankie (Patricia Arquette), a 'trendy, hip' hairstylist suddenly receives the stigmata (apparently transferred to her from a rosery who used to belong to an excommunicated priest), and Father Kiernan (Gabriel Byrne) is sent from Rome to investigate.  Their relationship changes throughout the movie from simple aquaintence to falling slightly in love, to frustration and anger, to a relationship that may be best described as father/daughter; all while Father Kiernan is trying to solve the perplexing mystery as to why she has received the stigmata.  Eventually Father Kiernana figures out that he's being used as a pawn to silence the supernatural in an attempt to make the \\"church\\" rule supreme over personal faith - a faith described by the Gospel of St. Thomas.  The movie closes by mentioning in passing what the Gospel of Thomas allegedly is, and pointing out the fact that the Catholic Church has rejected it.    I have heard people complain that this is too much of just a montoge of scattered images, but i don't think that that's a fair criticism.  The movie does have more of a photographic feel to it, in that it reads like groupings of photographs about particular moments in the character's lives over a period of time - as opposed to a completely smooth, seamless film.  If more segmented filming isn't your thing, you probably won't like the way the filming of this movie is handled - don't buy it.      In my opinion, the imagery in the movie is quite breathtaking and very visually interesting.  Both main characters, Frankie and Father Keirnan, play opposite to the dramatic scenery; that is they're both really rather matter-of-fact down to earth; something other people have reviewed as 'boring.'  Watch for yourself and see if you like the mixture.      A couple words about the DVD.  First, as many people have mentioned, the DVD does come with an alternate ending, and I agree with DJD - watch it with the director's ending, which is much more powerful, and just makes more sense.  Second, I should mention the one thing that I don't like about the DVD's extras: you have no choice but to watch all of the deleted scenes if you want to see any of them.  It's not a big deal, but it'd be nice to see all the choices instead of having to watch them all to see them all.          On a final note, I have to say that although I really enjoyed the movie (my wife and I just bought it because we both liked it so much), it does have a theological bent that I disagree with.  Although I'm not Catholic (I graduated from a Protestant Seminary), I do agree with the Catholic church in deciding to not cannonize the Gospel of St. Thomas.  I agree that faith is personal and is not regulated by the Church, but the gospel of Thomas consists of more than \\"The Kingdom of God is within you...\\" etc. etc., (the section that was continually quoted in the movie).  By the time you get to the end of The Gospel of St. Thomas, you find that Jesus is saying all sorts of things that are out of line with the cannonized gospels, and that he's a male chauvinist; far from the Jesus who took time to love and care even for a woman caught in adultry (John 8:3-11).  So, it's a good film about the tensions behind the scenes in religious communities, but this movie certainly does have a bias about a truly questionable document.      Enjoy the movie!
B000002U9W|5.0|There's a cow on the cover.  There are more cows on the inside. Heck, there's even a cow on the CD itself.  So, Imagine - - John and Yoko pose naked (front and rear) on the cover of their first album (front and rear) in 1968, and then in 1970 pose self-consciously together, clothed, in bucolic and inverted splendor in the grass on each other's solo de-buts. Pink Floyd don't do that, but they do put naked cows (rear and front) on the cover (front and rear) of ATOM HEART MOTHER the same year. And, with a Naturalistic flourish, one of them (the cows) is looking at you and unself-consciously drooling. No mooing in the music, though there may be some drooling going on in 'Alan's Psychedelic Breakfast'. Somewhere during the 24-minute title track (Ron Geesin is once again co-conspirator) the wind performers must have had to clear their instruments (presumably during the part in the middle with the Mellotron), and that's close enough. 'Summer 68' gets the nod as best track, and it's a good one- - Richard Wright, always second fiddle to the Gilmour and Waters (or Waters and Gilmour) hegemony, hardly ever got the respect or credit due him for the Floyd's greatness. Waters and Gilmour (or Gilmour and Waters) also get a track apiece and they (the songs) are just fine, thanks.
B000ANVQ0K|4.0|I just pre-ordered the 3 disk set. My only gripe is I hate the movie itself being split into two disks. Yes, I know the quality will be better, but movies split into two annoy the hell out of me. Anytime I sit down to watch Pearl Harbor, Seven or A Time To Kill (for example) my enjoyment is ruined by having to get up and put the other disk in to continue the movie or flipping the disk to see the other half of the movie. I know movie length and quality is why this is done, but really how much quality do you need? If you have a good dvd player the quality is most likely there. <br /> <br />You may wonder why I am getting this DVD set then. My major reasons is EXTRAS! For one I love commentaries and this set will offer three of them up. Commentaries give good insight, humor and let you get a feel for those involved in making the movie. I like that James Cameron has a commentary (loved his commentaries on Aliens, Terminator and T2 Ultimate Edition). The Director commentaries are usually good if the director is not boring. Kate Winslet and Gloria Stuart should give insight into the character of Rose. Two historians commentary should give us actual facts to hear what most-likely took place in reality. <br /> <br />I have the original DVD release of Titanic and it is everything that is wrong with DVD releases for me, for one it is a bare-bones DVD release with only the trailer. Now for the movie itself I might stick to the original DVD release, but when I want to hear the commentaries or see the extras I will throw on this new DVD release. <br /> <br />For those who wanted a documentary Titanic was probably not the movie for you. The romance is the drawing point to relate to what these people went through. I doubt if any of us can relate to being on a huge ship and have it sinking in freezing waters. Though the mystery of just what took place that night is still very compelling, the romantic aspect makes it very relatable to people today. <br /> <br />This is not a movie for most men, unless if you are a romantic (as I am) this will most likely not appeal to you. If you want action basically go to the part where the ship hits the iceberg and watch from there. Or just buy other James Cameron movies like Terminator, T2 or Aliens. Titanic is a very visual movie. It's strengths lie in beautiful scenery of the ship, ocean and sky. The score matches the breathtaking scenery. For comparison, if you like James Cameron's movie The Abyss you will probably like this, if not you most likely won't like Titanic. <br /> <br />I liked the movie. There were some slow aspects of it that could be called boring, and it was very much a chick-flick, but the romance is what gives the movie heart and emotion. It gives a lot of meat to the movie in that a lot of Hollywood movies sacrifice story to fit into the 90 minute or 2 hour time slots for most movies. While Titanic's story could be called simple it is done this way to make it relatable. Viewers should feel like they are almost on the ship themselves and given that panicky feeling when the ship is sinking just like all the passengers feel. Without the romance it would have been hard to relate to the people from that time. As long as the movie is, it doesn't seem that long if you like it. If you don't like the movie it will seem like it takes forever. So warning for those of you out there who don't like chick-flicks, stay away! For those of you who want reality about Titanic I recommend watching History or Discovery channels. For those of you who want to be entertained by a romance along with a some bits of reality Titanic should be the movie for you!
B000A0GP4K|3.0|The fans were right. When Dylan performed with an accoustic guitar, he was articulate and engrossing. But when he plugged in, he delibrately moaned and messed up the songs as best he could.     His background band, which would later become THE Band, sounds like a dropped drawer of kitchen utensils.    The recordings of these same songs are tight and understandable. The performances are an insult to the fans who invested there hard-earned money to see him.    BOOOOOOO!!!!!

Stick to what you like JiggaJ is not trying to review country or rock' n roll of course I'm not going to like that because I dont listen to it.  I could understand if you gave an hip hop cd between 3 and 5 stars but you didnt you dissed everyone that you reviewed. Anyway this cd was good for its time some new hiphop fans probably wouldn't like it but if you was a teenager in the mid 90's you would love it like DJ Premier said Big L rest in peace!!!!!1 P.S. Donna before you review certain rap artist please keep in thought that you cant diss 50 cent and give Clay Aiken the upmost respect and think that you're reviews are going to get appreciated But Anyway this CD is good don;t listen to donna if it's hiphop only if it is a video game!

Although it falls under the comedy category I sometimes feel its more of a dark humorous drama. <br />Great cast. Great story line and a very well directed. Much better then sex and the city I don't know why the two shows are always compared.  A must buy. And to all the married women out there make sure your husband watch this show so they will always know whose the boss. <br />

B00006L7XQ|5.0|I don't often take the time to review an item but I had to do this in reverence to Johnn Cash. I often hear people saying that many try to cover songs and hope they meet or exceed the quality of the original but never do. Cash has never disappointed in making each song remarkable. This album is no exception.  <br /> <br />The well traveled voice adds a depth and character that brings tears to my eyes during some songs. The last track \\"We'll meet again\\" is very fitting and a bit eerie listening to him give it his all to give us one last ablum. Thanks for leaving us with so much JC, we'll meet again.

0446677450|1.0|Lots of reviewers have exposed much of the nonsense of Kiyosaki's book so I won't rehash them. Instead I'd like to focus on the one attitude promoted by the book that I find troubling and dangerous. This is the attitude that getting a good education, obtaining job skills, being an employee, and saving and investing carefully for retirement is a \\"loser\\" mentality. Kiyosaki's premise is that you're a sucker for doing that when you could be so much better off supposedly \\"simply\\" obtaining \\"assets\\" or using some \\"system\\" to make money with little work, little risk, requiring little skill or ability and which would lead to being able to retire young and rich.    Its a great fantasy and will certainly appeal to young people who don't want to study, work hard and want to live the easy life right from the start but people need to get real first. I'm not saying it can't be done or it hasn't been done but there's a HUGE leap of logic that Kiyosaki makes between what is POSSIBLE versus what is LIKELY to happen if you think like that.    Imagine that I promoted the idea that working is for suckers when you can just play the lottery and live in luxury without ever working. Heck I can even point to so many examples of people who have succeeded! But does that mean it makes sense to drop out of school, don't bother getting job skills or even working at all, living with your parents or on the street and playing the lottery weekly until you strike it rich? Obviously not because on average, you're going to be far far worse off with this mentality. A very few will succeed but the vast vast majority will be way worse off and this is quite obvious.    Now Kiyosaki isn't exactly saying quit your job and play the lottery all year long. But the same analysis still holds. Okay so you've decided not to bother with education or getting job skills or working for someone else, saving and carefully investing for the future because that's for \\"losers\\". So what do you think you'll do? Do \\"No moneydown real-estate investing\\" a-la Carleton Sheets or Robert Allen? Use some kind of \\"system\\" for trading in stocks a-la Wade Cook? Join Amway/Quixtar or other MLMs? Participate in the latest Don Lapre \\"opportunity\\"? Have faith that somehow you'll invent the equivalent of the \\"wheel\\" or some \\"system\\" and live off of that invention? Be convinced that you'll found and/or own hugely successful businesses? Sure its possible you MIGHT succeed doing these things. But the point is that it's not LIKELY to happen.    Despite Carleton Sheets and the rest making it seem otherwise, in reality, its not that easy at all to create real estate holdings that are profitable without a LOT of EFFORT and some LUCK. R/E is RISKY, and will be MUCH HARDER to pull off profitably with \\"no money down/no collateral\\". (Hint: The notion that you can readily obtain finacing with \\"no money down\\", that properties maintain themselves or you can hire someone to do it for cheap, that good reliable tenants can be taken for granted, you'll never have vacancies, real estate prices only go up, rents always cover expenses, that the R/E market is full of idiots or desperate sellers offering deep discounts but also full of idiots ready to buy R/E from you at a premium, that you won't face competition from other R/E investors, etc these are fantasy notions with only a passing resemblance to reality.)    As for starting a business, this is likewise risky and also requires a lot of work and luck to make them successful. Most businesses fail within 5 years. Notwithstanding the rare mega-success, the vast majority of businesses that do succeed enable the owner to make a modest living but usually with much more stress and hard work than an employee. (Kiyosaki would say just hire people to do the work for you and just sit back and rake in the profits, ignoring of course the reality that the vast majority of businesses are not successful enough that you can afford to do that). 'Nuff said about MLMs and other 3am informercial \\"opportunities\\". As for coming up with some invention you can live off of, unless you've got a decent idea already, its a bit much to think you'll somehow magically come up with that idea eventually.    I agree that in today's global marketplace, job security is a thing of the past. The idea of completely relying on an employer for your financial needs and taking for granted automatic pay raises, health and pension benefits, etc. is gone. BUT to therefore conclude that education, getting job skills and being an employee is for \\"suckers\\" because you yourself will certainly be better off through some scheme is absurd and dangerous and it troubles me that some young people are going to read this book and get this mistaken impression.    It's one thing to say that you should consider investing in real estate, stocks, starting your own business, etc either on the side or full time based on REALISTIC notions of the effort, risk, and amount of actual success possible (not fantasy notions with no basis in reality) when you're in a reasonable position to succeed doing so. I have NO PROBLEM with that. It is quite another to give the false impression and false hope that you'll ON AVERAGE be better off than if you try to succeed the supposed \\"loser\\" way (of getting a good education, a good job, disciplined spending, and saving and investing carefully) because this is certainly not the truth despite the picture Kiyosaki paints.

0307276902|5.0|This is a gritty, hard hitting, harrowing book of alcoholism and drug addiction as told through the eyes of the addict himself.  The book is graphic and upsetting, yet compelling at the same time.  There is a section where this man must endure major dental reconstruction without the benefit of any anesthetic.  Here I felt there was a bit of deviance from any reality, because in truth although an addict might be denied morphine, or any drug that would put him into an altered state, I doubt he'd be denied simple Novacain.  What that section does do though is convey the absolute horror not just of the pain of reconstruction of his mouth, but of his very life.  A definite must read, albeit a bit long 400 pages.
B0009W5JS2|5.0|If you're going to make an action movie, think big; that's what I say.  XXX: State of the Union thinks big - and then some.  I'm not a huge fan of action films, but this one is truly the bee's knees (hey, I'm just trying to avoid saying \\"This film is awesome\\" here).  I don't really see how anyone could be disappointed in this thriller.  Is it realistic?  Well, no - but action movies are never realistic.  That's why they're called action movies and not documentaries.  And, actually, the basic scenario brought to life here might be more possible that many people think - you'll never count me among the crowds chanting \\"It can't happen here.\\"  I'll admit, when I saw the film's PG-13 rating, I was a little wary.  PG-13 never bodes well for violence and explosions and bloodshed and general destructive mayhem, but the lack of an R rating turned out to be meaningless here - as there is plenty of stuff that goes boom throughout the entire film.<br /><br />America loves an anti-hero, especially one with the unsurpassed attitude and general bad-a, uh, steel-plated ba-, uh unsurpassed self-confidence of Darius Stone (Ice Cube).  Nine years in a maximum-security prison, courtesy of a corrupt general now serving as Secretary of Defense, hasn't done anything to sugar-coat Stone's outlook on life.  (Of course, only civilians can serve as Secretary of Defense, but let's just pretend we don't know that; while we're at it, let's also pretend that said Secretary of Defense is in charge of Presidential security, since the Secret Service is nowhere to be found in this movie).  If you're NSA agent Augustus Gibbons (Samuel L. Jackson) and your whole crew of good men has just been taken out by the most elite of attacks, Stone is just the kind of man you want on your team - and so it is that the good guys bust Stone out of prison to christen him the new XXX.  Many extremely expensive explosions, not to mention gunfights and hand-to-hand combat scenes, quickly follow.  There are a number of twists and turns along the way to the truth of the unprecedented plot playing out in the Beltway, but let's just say there are no locked doors as far as Stone is concerned.  He's a door-crasher from way back.  Maybe the elements of the final scenario are a little unrealistic, but I didn't care, since I was watching rather than analyzing the movie at the time.<br /><br />Others may disagree, but I thought XXX: State of the Union was a great action movie; it had everything I want in this kind of thriller, and there's nothing more enjoyable than getting to the truth of a vast conspiracy - especially when the path is filled with as many explosions as the filmmakers can pack into 100 minutes.  It's true that a lot of innocent civilians and a fair share of good guys are killed in the process, but this is just a movie -a wildly entertaining one that I thoroughly enjoyed.d turns along the way to the truth of the unprecedented plot playing out in the Beltway, but let's just say there are no locked doors as far as Stone is concerned.

B000A3DFZE|4.0|I never thought I would Write something like This is a Very Nice album about Eric Clapton...However....<br />It really seems as if he has found some Peace and some sense of home and family.<br />As usual there is excellent production and musicianship but as others have noted his guitar playing takes a back seat this go around. Eric has often changed direction, style and challenged himself to bare his feelings, and this album is significant in that it displays where he is as a human being today.<br />The fact that he played again with John Mayall and regrouped with Cream shows that he has come to termes with who and where he is as as a musician, and is not content to just put out expected product. Not for everyone, but great work as usual.
B00005QDW1|5.0|Lets face it: \\"Tragic Kingdom\\" will always be No Doubt's `fire-starter'.  They jumped into the musical world with \\"Spiderwebs\\", rocked soulful chicks' worlds with \\"Don't Speak\\", and helped promote a television show with \\"I'm Just a Girl\\".  But after the success of that platinum selling album, No Doubt disappeared for a few years, and then attempted to make an intuitive and subdued comeback with \\"Return of Saturn\\".  While the artistry of \\"Return of Saturn\\" was amazing, and several tracks were worthy of praise, the album was considered to be filler, and No Doubt's attempt at seriousness was ridiculed.   <br /> <br />Getting back to what fans of No Doubt love most, the group released its newest album, filled with bubbly and simpleminded tracks.  \\"Rock Steady\\" has a quality \\"Return of Saturn\\" missed: it's fun!  The entire tone of the album is laid back and energetic, with almost no attempt at seriousness.  However, there are moments of reflection and meaningfulness (\\"Platinum Blonde Life\\", \\"Underneath It All\\").  The collaboration of producers on this album made it a mixed bag of tricks, which somehow came out complimenting each other in the end.   <br /> <br />Mostly, Gwen longs for the perfectly imperfect relationship, loving her man despite all his flaws.  The gentlemen of the band are clearly having a good time playing the music on this album.  \\"Don't Let Me Down\\" has a great energetic vibe full of 80's synthesizers and catchy guitars.  \\"Hella Good\\", \\"Hey Baby\\" and \\"Underneath It All\\" are well-known, thanks to extended radio play.  The uppity tunes on \\"Rock Steady\\" are extremely entertaining, however most of the slower tracks leave a more lasting impression.  In particular, \\"Running\\" and the title track \\"Rock Steady\\" offer a great amount of depth and enthusiasm, despite their slower paces.  Another noteworthy song is \\"Start The Fire\\" with its interesting blend of percussion, string plucking, and electronic bagpipe synthesizers.  In \\"Waiting\\", No Doubt successfully combines their style with Prince's quirkiness to create a tune that pops. <br /> <br />The song content consists of yearning, longing, obsessing, craving, waiting and wishing.  But thanks to Gwen's sugary whiny tone (hey, that's not a bad thing) this actually works.  The sneakiness of songs like \\"Making Out\\" and \\"In My Head\\" perfectly compliment the angst in Gwen's voice.  \\"Detective\\" is another prime example of lyrical uncertainty.  <br /> <br />Every single song on this album is catchy and I can guarantee you'll be fighting for hours to get the melodies out of your head.  This album was No Doubt's battle cry as the flashed back into the main spotlight of the music scene.  It's pretty wild and jumpy, and altogether fun.  As Gwen boldly states, \\"you got me feelin' hella good, so lets just keep on dancin'.'
B000002JS8|5.0|Just a quick drop on the ground to all my deceased friends. JOHNNY! We all miss you, see you underground kid!<br /><br />OK, anyway... HIGHWAY TO HELL was the last one by cosmic friend BON SCOTT. The title track was amazingly a fitting title for the mans last album, as he would die tragically by choking on his own vomit less than a year after its release. We are all sure that he must be making it, in the Promised Land for sure. This album is great.. as are all AC/DC albums. It was the first album to really sell in the U.S. due to the money that went into its production. Compared to earlier albums this one has a lot more polish on it, but it does not hurt the bands integrity at all. The title track was the big single, but there were other big ones here too, TOUCH TO MUCH is sort of like Satans answer to disco (AC/DC has lots of rhythms that are strangely danceable) WALK ALL OVER YOU is another good example. NIGHT PROWLER is a twisted blues jam. BON SCOTT is sleaze rock. He created it. He did it right. God Damn!<br /><br />AC/DC became known as a Satanic band because of this one. They really were just some sleazy rock and rollers, although the group shot on the cover of this one is GREAT! F'in A ROCK AND ROLL!
B000A0GP0Y|4.0|This is a remake of a Burt Reynolds movie.  Burt is in this one too, but he plays a different character. So, it's still a Burt Reynolds movie, sort of.  The fact is this is a fun movie.  The Criminals are big dumb guys.  The guards are big dumb guys.  They play football like kids in a schoolyard.  The violence is cartoony.  The whole movie was great.  Don't try to think too much though; this is not a movie that needs to be analyzed.
B000AA305M|5.0|A New Day at Midnight was an outstanding follow up to White Ladder, and this is even better.  Buy two copies for when you wear out the first one.
B000A0GP18|5.0|As good as the first movie, but better for the young kids.
B000AADYRQ|4.0|I prefer the older stuff, but this record is very well done and enjoyable.
B00029LNHS|2.0|I bought this album because I loved Where's The Love and Shut Up. I'm expecting funk! <br />I was disappointed. I know everyone in the band has different taste in music, but there is not much variety on this album. Most the songs sound the same and there is rarely a melody on the songs. The singles are the only ones that are catchy and if you think the album is going to be anything like what you've heard on the radio: you will be mistaken. <br /> <br />1. What a boring song to start off a CD. It could be a club song if you remix it, but then again, most songs can. Let's hope it gets better. 1/5 <br /> <br />2. BEP remake of Madonna's Holiday with their own 'funk'. Let's get real. It's slow and it's trash. 1/5 <br /> <br />3. Remake of Let's Get It Started. The title is cheaky and you can definitely have fun with this song, but it gets old fast. 4/5 <br /> <br />4. This song is just annoying. Reminds me of something they would play at urban African clubs. 1/5 <br /> <br />5. Favourite song. Plenty of beat and great lyrics. Upbeat and catchy. 5/5 <br /> <br />6. Another boring, retarded song. 1/5 <br /> <br />7. OK. Obviously an album filler. 1/5 <br /> <br />8. Now I'm wating for the last song. 1/5 <br /> <br />9. I love Fergie, but this song does not do it for me. You might not skip it though. 2/5 <br /> <br />10. I made it to the bridge with Fergie, and that part is pretty good, but that's the only part. 2/5 <br /> <br />11. Another retarded chill-out song. 1/5 <br /> <br />12. Cool song with attitude. It actually sound a bit like rock. It's different. It's great. 5/5 <br /> <br />13. Slow, catchy and great song! 5/5 <br /> <br />14. Another boring chill-out song. 1/5 <br /> <br />15. For a bonus track, this is pretty lame. 1/5 <br /> <br />16. Didn't I hear this one before? It could be track #1, 2, etc. Ok. The \\"yo, whazzup\\" bit is funky, but come on. No no no. 1/5
B0002OERI0|1.0|If you spent any money on this CD, you wasted your cash. This CD is the worst ever by Greenday. It is over produced and is as Pop as Pop can be. You don't believe me? Just listen to the radio, it's on at least twice an hour on several radio stations.<br /><br />Greenday has fallen SOOOOO low they shouldn't be calling themselves Greenday anymore. They are some totally new band that plays to the record producers and to the middle/high school crowd. Their songs are repetitve and their sounds are over played. This isn't even close to being \\"Warning\\" in its sounds. I would rather be strapped to a chair and forced to listen to Dashboard Confessional's emo bullcrap then this garbage.<br /><br />If you REALLY want this CD, get it from somebody who already wasted their money and save yourself almost $20. Better yet just use a tape recorder and get the songs off the radio.
B000AMB21O|5.0|I saw this film in the theater with a friend over what I believe to be a decade ago. It was late and true to form I fell asleep through some of it. Consequently this film which was surreal and haunting to begin with now follows me, glimpsed periferally, occasionally breaking the surface of the subconscious. It's close to Holloween as I write this so the thought of movies that disturbed me (I looked up Eraserhead before this one, I already own City of Lost Children) and this one, once again, danced before me just out of focus. Then I find it here. But.....PAL Reg 2.... another veil to hide behind. <br />This movie has gotten under my skin like a hypodermic, alternately injecting me with halucenagens and drawing...sangre. This may force me to buy a DVD player on which to play this. A horrible expense but what choice do I have. The haunting must stop.
0793563836|5.0|I enjoy playing drums, but when a nice bass showed up at the local pawn shop, i splurged.  Afterwards, I checked out a few volumes by the \\"names\\" in bass, but found them either overly complex, or overly exhaustive in information.  Ed Friedland put together the \\"just right\\" package. <br /> <br />First off, it does NOT depend on TAB.  You start with notes.  And even when TAB appears far into the book, it is not necessary as you can still play in notes.  And as mentioned below, you get to play \\"tunes\\" early one, even if they are very simple.  Thus, you get to build a base playing along with the band on the CD. <br /> <br />Everything progresses cleanly.  You get pictures of fingerings, diagrams of fingerings, and (early on) numbering of the fingering of notes under the notes themselves.  In other words... <br /> <br />This is the book you want if you don't have/can't have a teacher.  It won't take you all the way there by itself, but you'll cross a few county lines on the way to the big time!
B00005JOI3|3.0|I have to say that I am getting more and more impressed with this Ryan Gosling kid.  He sure knows how to pick em...and he sure knows how to bring em home.  I was floored with his performance in last years 'the notebook' and in 'murder by numbers' a few years back, but I felt that he went beyond that here.  He really is a talent of an actor.  That aside, this movie was decent, but I would have liked to feel a little more come from it.  It left me a little bored at times, giving me this 'I know I've seen this before' type feeling.  The plot is pretty standard.  You have your shrink (McGregor) and you have your patient (Gosling) and throughout the movie the shrink is trying to figure out whats wrong with the patient.  The ending, twist as it may be, is very generic and actually will have you disbelieving itself.  Lets just say that the climax revolves around your patient but the entire movie revolves around your shrink and so it almost makes NO sense that your main charactor is Ewan McGregor and that leads to my main complaint.  With the ending that was given the script could have focused more on Goslings charactor, following him around instead of McGregor which to me would have made for a more interesting ride.  It's not that Ewan cant act, it's just that he did nothing for me in this film...but Ryan was amazing.  Another standout was Bob Hoskins who really nailed it this year with two great performances, his best being Bart in 'Unleashed', that for which I'd hope to see a AA Nod...anyways...this movie moves very slow and if you have the time to decipfer it's every move than you may really enjoy it, but a word to the curious...it's been done before and slightly better...but Gosling is good.
B0009S3HI0|1.0|I'm a huge Deftones fan... back to 1996 - Adrenaline era.  The three best things I love about Deftones are the music, the music, and the music...  and this CD is very lacking.<br /><br />You have three categories of songs on this CD.<br /><br />1)  Acoustic versions of popular songs.  Most fans have heard these or have them in MP3 format.  Even if they are different actual acoustic recordings of the same songs - we've all heard the acoustic version of the popular songs.  \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\" is the only REALLY good acoustic song.  It's different than the original.  The others just sound close to the heavy original versions.<br /><br />2)  Cover Songs.  These aren't really heavy versions they're more just Deftones-y sounding and really aren't that good.  \\"Simple Man\\" is interesting but wears quickly.<br /><br />3)  Bad Experimental Deftones Songs That Aren't Good Enough To Be On A Deftones Album.  This is the worst.  \\"Wax and Wane\\" is one of the worst songs I've ever heard from any band.  The material just isn't good.<br /><br />Where's the really good, HEAVY, Deftones songs... you get \\"Crenshaw Punch\\"... that's pretty much it.  I did also like \\"Please Please Please Let Me Get What I Want\\" because it's heavy and sounds like a Weezer/Deftones hybrid that's really well written.<br /><br />As for the DVD, I was asking the sales guy at Best Buy if there was a version without the DVD and the answer is NO.  The DVD showcases all of Deftones videos, of which only about 2 or 3 are really good, those being \\"Be Quiet and Drive\\", \\"Minerva\\", and \\"Change\\".  Overall their videos are very repetitive and somewhat uncreative.  The \\"behind the scenes\\" stuff is okay - you'll watch this DVD once and then be done with it.<br /><br />So for the $20+ price tag - this is NOT WORTH IT.  It just lacks musically.  Wait for the next album.
B0009X7BFA|5.0|If you liked the movie on the silver screen youll love it on your personal little black screen. I dont recomend buying it unless youve seen it though.
0307276902|2.0|I don't understand all the hype about this book.<br /><br />Maybe it's because I have read books about recovery and this one isn't all that earth shatteringly different.<br /><br />Maybe it's because the writing style didn't thrill me as it has others. (Frey's stream of consciousness style however does aptly convey the mindset of an addict and kudos for the publisher enabling this style to be printed!)<br /><br />Maybe it's because all of this publicity for James Frey scares me that others will not try the AA principles since this book alleges that Frey did not use the AA principles.<br /><br />Maybe it's because he so candidly states that he blantently and continuously violated the rules at Hazelton which doesn't bode well for others seeking success in achieving sobriety.  (Since all recovery programs have high failure rates including the 83% failure rate of AA, if AA has the lowest failure rate, then addicts DO have a better \\"chance\\" of success in the most successful program.)  Yes, Frey remains sober to this day however many may not have the mental fortitude Frey certainly must possess.<br /><br />While some of Frey's experiences and tales are riveting (entering the crack-spot, dental work and descriptions of Lily's life  experiences), I must say that some of Bill W.'s writings are similarly riveting for their time.<br /><br />Additionally, I am duly surprised that Oprah is promoting this book.  I almost wonder if her motives are less than altruistic in nature than capitalistic somehow (does she have dollars riding on this title's success???).
B000A7S4B0|1.0|1) if you want to transfer the songs to your iPod. <br />2) if you want to make mp3's. <br />3) if you want to listen to it on your pc. <br /> <br />The cd is copied protected, so you have no rights to it. You have to agree to a restrictive EULA before you are allowed to play it on a PC. You cannot copy the music to your iPod. <br /> <br />If you want this cd, which is very good by the way, purchase it from the iTunes store. Then you have the freedom to copy it to CD, and to copy it to your iPod. <br /> <br />As a side note: Amazon should add a warning label when any music cd is restricted.
B0007QJ1N4|5.0|This is Queens Of The Stone Age darkest attempt at an album in my opinion.Though this gives it character,something different from their already high standards of their previous album<br /><br />\\"Songs For The Deaf\\".<br /><br />Unlike \\"Songs For The Deaf\\" the songs don't drag on,but there are some fairly long tracks like \\"Long Slow Goodbye\\" .<br /><br />(With exeption of \\"Someone's In Wolf\\" wich drags on...)<br /><br />Bass,yes there is a new bass player.Many wont even notice on a slightest difference.The guitar riffs have alot of similarity between one another.\\"Little Sister\\" is the single for this album and the riff to this spread through the album like wild fire.\\"Medication\\" is a very short song (very catchy),though it will have a feeling of \\"Little Sister\\".<br /><br />The album opens up with \\"This Lullaby\\" a very soft song,and it's ACOUSTIC thats something that will catch you off guard when firstly popping this in your cd player.You'd assume something with a little more kick to it.This song though is still good and should give you an idea to the albums theme.Slow and gloomy it will take awhile for you to soak it in after being use to their old biggies like \\"No One Knows\\".The songs are brilliantly  odd<br /><br />\\"Burn The Witch\\" is a fine example as to what i mean.<br /><br />As for the dvd i found it pathetic it was worth the extra money if you bought it used and cheap. As the case is nicer and the dvd is a decent bonus with a music video to \\"Someone's In Wolf\\"  shown me why any music video over 6 minuts of dancing drunk wolves is traumatizing.(That and it will bore you to death).The docementary is kinda lame.<br /><br />I reccamend this it's a good album,but you have to have an open mind or you'll pick two or three songs and say i'm done with this album.
B00005JOI3|3.0|STAY is the epitome of the old clich \\"all style and no substance.\\"  There is a lot of serious camera trickery, wild editing, nifty camera movies and the like.  It's also got lots of moments that are clearly meant to be creepy, or at least heavy with foreshadowing...you just don't know what's being foreshadowed.  Directed by Marc Forster, who did both MONSTER'S BALL and FINDING NEVERLAND, STAY misses the mark when it comes to a STORY we can truly care about.  Forster has proven himself to be a fine director.  He also has probably done nearly as well as he could with this film...I suspect it's a movie that should not have been made in the first place. <br /> <br />STAY is nominally in the same ilk as SIXTH SENSE, THE RING, etc.  Heck, it even features a psychiatrist working with a disturbed youth.  Lots of portentious things happen throughout, so you certainly get the sense that something weird is going on, and that you've got a puzzle to sort out.  I guess it's fun to try to put the pieces together before the movie does it for you.  Thinking back on it, I think it MIGHT be possible to figure out where the movie is going to twist in the end...but there are an awful lot of red herrings on the way too. <br /> <br />The film starts as the story of a psychiatrist (EWAN MACGREGOR) who is assigned the case of a young man (RYAN GOSLING) who has stopped his car in the middle of the Brooklyn Bridge and set fire to it, and now is threatening to commit suicide by midnight on Saturday...just three days away.  The shrink believes the kid means it, but somehow he can't manage to get him committed, and can't even really keep track of him.  Gosling shows up on his time, not MacGregors, and they play a cat and mouse game, where MacGregor pries a few \\"facts\\" from Gosling, who then darts away.  Things get stranger when Bob Hoskins appears as MacGregor's mentor (and he also happens to be blind), because Gosling sees him and declares that this man is his dead father come back to life. <br /> <br />So, as MacGregor digs deeper, he begins to experience strange things himself...perhaps even carrying on conversations with ghosts.  His artist girlfriend (an underused Naomi Watts) tries to offer support, but she becomes a bit obsessed with the idea of meeting and helping this kid herself, as she has in the past attempted suicide herself.   <br /> <br />Things become more and more confusing as we approach the time of the suicide.  And then all is revealed.  The \\"twist\\" ending is rather mundane and has been done numerous times before.  I won't spoil it by hinting at what it is, but my impression was that I had just spend 90 minutes waiting for a pretty disappointing climax. <br /> <br />The movie never really makes us care very much for anyone in it.  MacGregor's character mostly comes across as a bit of a wimp (who can apparently cast aside all his other patients at the drop of a hat) and a terrible problem solver.  Watts is a moping cipher.  Janeanne Garafalo makes a brief appearance, and her character is one-note as well.  Gosling has the most to work with, but his character changes moods for no apparent reason, so it's difficult to work up much sympathy.  The whole puzzle of the film is academic...we don't invest emotion into it. <br /> <br />Then there are the pants.  MacGregor's character wears high-waters throughout the film, for NO good reason.  If you watch the ending VERY carefully, you'll know why his character dresses this way, but it is NOT worth it for the filmmakers to have thrown this in the mix.  Every time we see Ewan, we see his short pants and it is HUGELY distracting.  \\"WHY???\\" you ask yourself over and over.  \\"It makes no sense and it looks really stupid besides,\\" you answer yourself.   <br /> <br />So, in summation, the film has a lot of style and cool trickery.  It lacks a heart, and unfortunately, the climax lacks real surprise or impact.  The final scenes do manage to develop just a bit of sadness...the first real emotion we feel.I can't recommend the movie to anyone, but I can see that some people might like it more than me, depending on how intrigued they are by the idea of figuring out the \\"puzzle\\" of the film.  It is rated \\"R\\" for some strong language, but otherwise the film is pretty mild, and could easily have been PG-13...perhaps this would have helped the opening weekend box-office, cuz this film is going nowhere fast, based on its initial box office take. <br />
B00005JO0J|2.0|This thing here is DEFINITELY very overrated. If you havent seen the film, don't read, many spoilers ahead.  <br /> <br />Ok, the goods:  <br />- Nice GFX, but then again so does every other sci-fi film.  <br />- some nice scare moments  <br />- the second part of the film was more interesting  <br /> <br />the bads:  <br />- I think the lead actor is very weak. Worse than Keanu Reeves. I could not understand was he meant to be a comical dude or a rough one. He seemed all-over-the-place wacko non-leader type of guy. Maybe it was the bad acting.  <br /> <br />- The characters where all the same, had the same kind of humour etc. Even the only 'bad' guy - the black dude that turned good. They were the same!  <br /> <br />- bad dialogue. uninteresting. It really sounded like a tv episode.  <br /> <br />- BIGGEST gripe: Holes in the script. Unrealistical, not logical behaviors. Right from the beginning. Some examples:  <br /> <br />In the beginning when the captain is told that they could all die. He then says to the microphone that small turbulance and explosions ahead: WTH? Clearly this dialogue was put in for cinema viewers pleasures. Not logical behaviour. Or is he a kamikaze, am I missing something?  <br /> <br />In the end where there is the reavers hold-up at the gates where they put CRATES in front of them and in front the doors!? And then when they are out of ammo, and have lost men, some of them are hurt, then they back out behind some VERY solid steel doors and take a breath. WTH? Why didnt they start the hold up there?  <br /> <br />Reavers didnt seeme to possess ANY firepower. WTH? They have intergalactic spaceships, and fight with their CLAWS!? OK, they had darts!?  <br /> <br />Whats up with using bows in that same sequence anyways? Bows fly faster than machinegun fires? WTH!  <br /> <br />Also in the end where the black dude and captain are fighting. Fighting for what? That the disk would/wouldn't get displayed, right? So why couldnt the black guy just destroy the disk reader? You know the thing where he placed the disk and pressed the miracle \\"Send All\\" button. Like WTH??  <br /> <br />About the disk... left me thinking.. if they talked to that guy over satellite, the one who had hundreads of LCD's and a robot wife. Couldnt they just SEND the signal to him and he then would have broadcasted it. Ok, this is something you could say: \\"you cant send holographic images via satellite\\" but still strange.  <br /> <br />There where MANY more of these, but my memory is weak. Believe me I was like 'WTH?' most of the time.  <br /> <br />OK  <br /> <br />All in all I would give it 2 stars This is what it truly should be. They put a lot of money into this, you could see, but writing ruined it. And better actors would have been nice.  <br /> <br />Scripting - ai ai ai!  <br /> <br />Ending on a more positive note: if you close your eyes on these points, are a simple person, or a pre-teen it would be a pretty awesome movie :)
0767802470|5.0|Great movie, far surpasses the original.  Pity about the English dubbing, despite using some of the actual actor's voices, as the dialogue sounds like the Girl Guides or the moral police have done a job on it.  My advice, view only in German and read the sub-titles, as it was meant to be seen.
B00082ZS5W|4.0|good songs, slightly different than the studio version.  However, the CD is protected by Sunncomm Media Max, so no digital playback without installing the Windows protection drivers.  If the CD wasn't protected, I would have given this 5 stars.

B000002UB3|5.0|Earlier, I wrote a review of Type O Negative's October Rust, and I was saying that I would include it in my top 10 OF ALL TIME....and it got me to thinking....those are pretty harsh words......top 10 OF ALL TIME. After submitting my review, I of course was reading it and then it hit me....what IS my number 1 album of all time...Immediately Abbey Road came to mind. Some may ask WHY Abbey? The answer is pure and simple.....it's perfect. <br /> <br />No doubt, the Beatles are without a question \\"THE\\" most influential band worldwide of all time. Not just because I am a huge fan, but because 35 years after their bitter breakup, bands are quoting the Fab Four as being a major influence...even young bands of today are influenced by the Greatest Love Afair of All Time. <br /> <br />Abbey Road has EVERYTHING a music lover with open mind could wish for, With every song taking it's own shape and style. Come Together and She's So Heavy representing the hard album rock of the late 60's, Something (quite possibly the greatest song of all time), shows a true heart felt love and admiration with a wonderful vocal from George Harrison, Here Comes The Sun, shows an unplugged side to the Beatles which they have shown frequently throughout their career. Oh! Darling is Paul McCartney and the others tipping their hat to 50's greats like Fats Domino and Little Richard, and of course, there is the two Medley's that constitute the BEST \\"side 2\\" of the vinyl generation. The Beatles took a bunch of unfinished, snippets of unused ideas and strung them together to flow perfectly from one to the other...then...the creme de la creme being The End. The End climaxes with a 3 part guitar war between Paul, George and John...in THAT order, with each one giving their two cents over and over with John being the last to bring it all down crashing. <br /> <br />One of the other highlights of the album is Because. Because is very unique in the sense that there was so much meticulous vocal overdubbing done by John, Paul and George. They sang three part harmony, with each member recording their own part three times...with each member recording themselves 3 times, it gives a grand total of 9 tracks, 9 voices altogether....talk about beauty!  <br /> <br />The only thing I wish for...and this goes for the ENTIRE Beatles catelog, I wish the Abbey Road engineers would remaster and remix the cd's with todays technology...as they did with Let It Be...naked. Not to strip it down, just remix it, remaster it, and amplify the sound. If you guys are reading...please heed...after all the versions we all know and love were issued on cd 18 years ago...it's time  for a facelift....don't you think? <br /> <br />Of course there is much more to Abbey Road that I left out, believe me...I could go on for DAYS! Perfect vocal harmonies, musicianship and TRUE brotherly love is what Abbey Road is made of. By the time the Beatles started recording Abbey, their relationships were VERY strained. But they were willing and able to put their differences aside...deliberately...to give one last shot and they did just that. Sadly, just a few months after it's release, the Beatles said goodbye to us as a foursome forever. Could they have gone further...I really don't think so. By the time they did Abbey, John, Paul, George and Ringo sang and played every note they could possibly give together as a whole and they gave one thousand percent each....there was no more juice left to squeeze. They literally gave us EVERYTHING they had.....EVERYTHING.
0307276902|2.0|This book was too moralizing. I mean come on life's not that important. This guys problem was he took \\"having fun\\" too far, chikiwawa doesn't have that problem and doesn't want to read moralistic bs either. Thankyou
B000000H57|5.0|Let me begin by saying that Type O does not have ONE crappy album in their catelog. Some better than others...yeah, but a crap CD...none. If one was to take a chance and purchase a cd, October Rust would be a great start...with Bloody Kisses a tie. <br /> <br />While Bloody Kisses (the band's biggest selling album to date) showcases Type O in a dark, vampire-like blood drinking horror, with an obvious Heavy Metal undertone, October Rust showcases them in true Goth/Metal fashion, with a HEAVY emphasis on melody while keeping things heavy. Like a 14th century castle dimmly lit by torch and candlelight, like a beautiful woman dressed in black and sobbing sadly with a smile...one cannot ignore the immense talent that Type O posseses. While the majority of their songs are not complex, the melodies, countermelodies and chord voicings carry October from beginning to end in one great big Gothic love affair. IF you are a first time listener, this is an album that M.U.S.T. be listened to with a 100 percent focus to detail. this is one of those releases that requires one to sit down, with a drink, dimm the lights (or turn them off), light a few candles and just listen...nice an loud...with NO interruptions. <br /> <br />Aside from the usual \\"prank\\" tracks that they are famous for, the album opens with Love You to Death...quite possibly one of the best dark love songs EVER written. it moves through like a black raincloud hanging low on a very dark winters day...moving slowly, holding form and intriguing those observing. Be My Druidess is a lighter side from \\"Death\\", with a very catchy groove courtesy of drummer Johnny Kelly. Other greats in the same vein as the first two are In Praise of Baccus, Red Water (Christmas mourning), Wolf moon and My Girlfriends Girlfriend. All songs are strong with structure, melody and warmth. Two acoustic-based pieces, Green Man and Die With Me, show Type O's softer side which is BRILLIANT!!!! Type O is a band that \\"tunes down' the guitars to givea much richer,deeper heavier sound, and REALLY shows with the 12 string acoustic guitars used on these two tracks....wonderful. <br />The highlights of the album are Cinnimon Girl, a cover of Neil Youngs original version, and Haunted. Cinnimon is brilliant from start to finish. An even BETTER version is available on the Least Worst of Type O Negative...which is a collection of hits and rarities...a very industrial/new wave version...like Nine Inch Nails meets Depeche Mode. <br /> <br />Slow, dragging, creepy, dark, cold and wet best describes Haunted, which brings October Rust to a close. Haunted shows Peter Steele's superior vocal strength ranging from the lowest of growltype spoken words to a howl; like a vampire in deep pain from a broken heart. <br /> <br />Being a fan of MANY genres (especially metal), I rate this album without a second glance in my top 10 of ALL TIME! It might take a few spins to get to that level...It took me a few I must confess. The first spin will have one saying its good...then it will go to very good, then great than awesome, then...well you get the point. <br /> <br />Type O Negative is quite possibly the most underrated band of all time. Which is very frustrating in today's era of \\"cookie-cutter\\" bands. My recommendation, buy it allong with Bloody Kisses...the two blend wonderfully like coffee and cream...trust me...this is good stuff!!!!
B00005YU1O|5.0|really, i can't.  i try to put it away for a couple of days, but i just keep coming back to it.  it's not just the animation, for which it has recieved so much praise.  it's also the content, which many reviewers have called mediocre.  it's not.  maybe not all of it will appeal to you, but there is just so much there to think about.  the characters are real, not just surreal.  the situations, although bizzare because of the choppy nature of the film, are things that we all go through.  it's like you're getting a cross section of lives from all the people he's ever met.  if you liked the book 'sophie's world' you would like this movie & vice versa.  it's like a trip through the history of philosophy.
1563890410|5.0|The Sandman is an incredible series on so many levels. If you've not read yet, please do (and please start with the first volume; you'll want to read them all eventually anyway, I guarantee). Some of the tales are deep, some profound, and this collection shares in all of that and at the same time is simply so much fun(!): Satan decides to close Hell down and hit the beach--he gives the keys to Morpheus, lord of dreams, who is then besieged with deities from all the world's pantheons, each of which wants the prime real estate for their own uses. What a premise! <br /> <br />And what execution! <br /> <br />The Sandman is up there with anything else printed in the late 20th Century. Begin reading it today.
B000063COX|5.0|Well, it all started here in 1980, although it was 5 years after the band was formed by Steve Harris. The line-up is different as well, we have Paul DiAnno on vocals, that left after Killers. We have Clive Burr on Drums, that left after Number of the Beast, and we have Dennis Stratton on lead guitar, he was few months only to record this album and then he left. Dennis was amazing on the album, maybe not great as Adrian but his riffs remind Dave Mustaine (Megadeth, ex-Metallica). But we still have here the bass master Steve Harris and Dave Murray. Clive Burr was an amazing drummer and he was actually even better than Nicko McBrain, Nicko is not a bad drummer but Clive has better sense of Rythm. DiAnno also done well here. He was the 2nd best Maiden singer, next to bruce, and next to him was Blaze Bayley who was also good, but he didn't suite the band. Also the album is more punkish than metalish. Compared to their later albums it's not very heavy but it still rocks. The only problem is the production, but this doesn't keep it from being one of Maiden's best. Aside from the holy trilogy (Beast, Piece & Powerslave) this is my favorite Maiden album.    Here are my favorite songs:    Prowler is good as Aces High and Moonchild atleast. it has a fast solo, and vocals are in top notch.    Remember Tomorrow is the best ballad I've heard from Maiden, the vocals and the main riff are awesome, it also becomes heavier at 2:30 and the solo is excellent.    Running Free is another highlight on the album. It has creative drumming, and this is a good song in general.    Phantom of the Opera is easily the best song here, this is the album epic, I especially enjoying playing this on my guitar.    Transylvania is with no doubt the one of the best Maiden instrumentals (2nd to 'Losfer Words' off powerslave), it is the thrashiest instrumental Maiden ever put out, Dave and Dennis were amazing in the solo.      Charlotte the Harlot is the beginning of the story they continued in '22 AcaciaAvenue' off Number of the Beast, 'Hooks In You' off No Prayer for the Dying, and 'From Here to Eternity' off Fear of the Dark. For my opinion this was the best of them all.    Other songs:    Sanctuary is my least favorite on the album, its not awful but I tend to skip it.    Strange World's intro is similar to Metallica's Nothing Else Matters, and 'Nothing' is an acoustic song. This is one of the only 4 Maiden songs which were entirely acoustic, this, 'Prodigal Son' off Killers, 'Wasting Love' off Fear of the Dark, and 'Journeyman' off Dance of Death.    The title track is also good, not the best here, but enjoyable.    Up The Irons!
1563890119|5.0|Hmmm... okay, perhaps a Shakespeare comparison might be a little over the top, yes? Like comparing every foreign despot to Hitler, comparing a given author to Shakespeare always has a whiff of exaggeration about it. <br /> <br />Or, maybe not. Who's to say what it would be like, to live in the same time of a genius, before generations of professors have been allowed their collective two-cents? To read the works of genius, first run, not for any class or \\"personal betterment\\" but simply out of enjoyment? And how does it change one's ability to appreciate genius when it comes in a form of art that is generally thought of as being low-brow, unrespectable? When most of us have a bias coming in? Did Elizabethans *really* believe that they were contemporary to the greatest English playwright of all time? The pinnacle of English literature for the next five hundred years to come? Unlikely.  <br /> <br />I'm not prepared, here, to tell you that Neil Gaiman is \\"the Shakespeare of our age.\\" I am certain that he, himself, would laugh-off such a thing. But, in The Sandman, we do have a work of art, a literary classic, a thing of beauty, call it what you will--it is genius. And yes, it is a comic (or graphic novel, if you prefer, but really, it is a comic), but so what? <br /> <br />The tales that Gaiman weaves, incorporating myths of every land and age, are timeless. They strike a chord that is not quite alien but not quite comfortable either. They are somehow both familiar and completely original. They engross from the shear strength of their storytelling, and question and teach and challenge, too. <br /> <br />If you're on the fence, considering... go ahead and take the plunge: give this series a try. At worst, you will have a marvelous time with characters that you won't find anywhere else, in sensuous, exotic, rich stories. And at best... you just might be witness to a Bard in the making.
B0000024K1|5.0|What can I say about this album that hasn't already been said? This disc is one that I have listened to countless times and it speaks to me every time and NEVER gets old. This CD was masterfully crafted and has a great flow to it; each song seamlessly goes to the next. Chuck D. is in top form and the samples are great too. \\"Black Steel In the Hour of Chaos\\" is an incredible song and I love that they used a sample from the classic Isaac Hayes track \\"Hyberbollicsyllabicsesquedadamistic\\" from the \\"Hot Buttered Soul\\" album. There are also several creative samples from the \\"Wattstax\\" live concert throughout the album, and a snippet from David Bowie's \\"Fame\\" in \\"Night of the Living Baseheads\\". Tracks like \\"Don't Believe the Hype\\" and \\"Prophets of Rage\\" are both classics, but virtually everything on this is a classic. Chuck D. is by far my favorite rapper and I admire his knowledge of music and his message. His assessment that rap was the CNN of black America was dead on the mark, and Public Enemy really used rap as a tool to spread knowledge, which is how it should be. It's a shame that so much of today's rap music has degenerated into rants about money, violence, materialism and sex. This CD is a blueprint for all future rappers and everyone should own a copy.
B000777J2S|5.0|I adore Anthony and the Johnsons, never have I felt so much passion in the music, my favourite song Hope There's Someone, gives me goosebumps everytime I listen to it. The album is captivating and once you start listening to it you can't help but listen to it all the way through. A teacher of mine watched them live and said it was one of the best experiences of his life!
B000059RL3|5.0|Marvin Gaye broke out of the mold of Motown crooner on this album and came into his own. This is one of the best albums ever, and an incredibly woven concept album also. Marvin Gaye was able to articulate the turmoil in America at the time so well, and his singing as well as the music are AMAZING. This album contains one of my favorite songs of all time too, \\"Inner City Blues (Make Me Wanna Holler)\\". He was even able to tie in the melody  from \\"What's Goin' On\\" at the end of the song, which is one of the many touches that give this album its cohesiveness. I would recommend \\"What's Goin' On\\" to any music fan. It is a timeless classic and should be considered an essential for any collection.
B00005JO0J|5.0|I can not add to what the reviews in this space have said. What I can speak to is from the point of view of an actor in this business for a long time . This is what film used to be, A great story, a director writer who knows his craft, A cast of actors who play it real and with heart. None of which are superstars ( even if they deserve it) I got turned on by the series and it transfers to the big screen perfectly. I hope to see more of this type of work in the future because unfortunatly Hollywood needs all the help it can get I gave up going to the movies because I have been disapointed so often I do not wish to spend good money on garbage. This film and series have restored a little faith that good work can still be done. Congrats Joss keep up the good work Thomas
B000002H2Z|5.0|This is by far the best Cure album... I own them all and this one is the sauce de creme.... it has everything....If I were stuck on an island with 50 albums this would be one of them    enjoy!
B000088E6D|5.0|Michael Buble has an amazing, rare talent. His voice is so smooth and beautiful you can't help but fall in love. He also does a wonderful job in his covers of classic oldies. He is a must-have in everyones music collection.
B00003CXD0|4.0|This is the funnist movie. A man cannot get a job on a soap so he dresses as a women, tries again & get hired. He even has a man want to date him as the woman
B00005A46T|4.0|I have only one word to describe Iowa, and that is BEAUTIFUL.  The reason I say this is because the music is wonderful, and gives powerful messages.  Although Iowa is not the best Slipknot album, as an EXTREMELY big Slipknot fan, I have to give 4 stars.  Slipknot (S/T), is another great album...  My personal favorites from Iowa, include \\"My plague\\", \\"Skin Ticket\\", \\"Left Behind\\", and \\"The Shape\\".  This album is hard core, and for anyone that loves a mix of metal, and hard rock, this is a very wise purchase.
B00003CXPJ|4.0|This movie delivered what it promised...a funny and stupid comedy. Ben couldn't have done a better impression of a male model, I am a huge fan of \\"BLUE STEEL\\". I think that Ben Stiller really is a wonderful comedic actor, he is so funny.  Will Farrell is awesome in this movie. He was very over the top, and unexpected. Coming into this movie don't expect Oscar worthy material, nor should you expect goofball humor. The characters ability to keep straight faces through out the movie amazes me. It shows their true talent as actors. Definitely a must see.
B0001NBMBC|3.0|Volume 3 SHOULD BE a very large dissappointment to a true \\"maggot\\".  A few songs were extremely well done, including \\"Vermilion\\", \\"Duality\\", and \\"The Blister Exists\\".  There were a few good surprises as well, including \\"The Virus of Life\\", and \\"Danger-Keep Away\\".  But even if a few of the tracks are impressive, I feel like their next album should be called Volume 4, the obvious verses.  Am I the only one who feels that this album was dissappointing?  Maybe so, but as I said before, I'm a HUGE slipknot fan...the only word that came to mind from this album is baby language, YUCK.
0316172324|1.0|Ok so at the end of the book you are given the full belief that what you work out in your mind in the first couple of seconds of any situation you are right and just go with your \\"gut\\" instinct. Unless of course you are doing the cola challenge or rolling in a car with 3 other cops and are carrying weapons.<br /><br />The book is nice fast read but is hard to use for any practical application.
1881273156|5.0|This book is a great asset for couples looking to understand each other in a greater way. In our marriages, we all need to feel loved by our spouse. Many times husbands and wives will genuinely care for one another but neither is adequately able to express it. This book point out that people understand love in different ways and helps us choose the most effective way to show our love. Couples struggling to keep love alive in their relationship would benefit greatly from this book. It is an easy read and definitely worthwhile for all married couples.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I bought this video set sight unseen, I liked Buffy and Angel so I figured Joss Whedons other TV show should be good.  And it was, big time!  How this show only made it half a season I don't know.  Just get it and then prepared to be angry, because you will want so much more!
076113719X|5.0|Bought for my daughter who is a Single Parent with 2 small daughters to keep track of along with her Job.  She finds it very useful and is always keeping track of things at home with it.  It takes you through the whole school year also.  Plan on getting her one for next year again.  Will buy it in the late summer so that she can have it before school starts in September.
B000063JDE|4.0|This movie sets off in a  \\"mayberry- esque\\" town, nice holesome town, kid walkin around finds a human ear then go to investigate to get into furthur trouble.  He meets a lunge singer who \\"belongs\\" to dennis hopper and that where the sex and violence and violent sex comes into play.<br /><br />  Another great dennis hopper movie, the only david lynic i like, unlike anything else, greatly reccommend this movie if you like violence, criminal ravishment.  Great addition to your violence , sexual violence underground collection.  Other recommedations,: bad lutenant- harvey keitel,
B0007XT7V8|4.0|I have to say that is a very good cd and that theory of a deadman should keep up the great work. The next single that I think that Theory of a deadman should make is \\"Save the best for last\\". This is a amazing song which I think would be good for the band to release. I think this song would make them sell even more albums then they have done to this point. Hopefully this will be their next single. Also they should atleast release one more song before they stop releasing songs. Their first song they released \\"No surprise\\" was a great up beat song which had a very hilarious video. The band should keep going with their awesome CD'S.
B0000025GW|5.0|Just picked this up again and recalled that fateful day in 1979 when I first bought the album and my world was rocked.  To me, this is Bobby at his best -- songs from the soul, lyrics from the heart, melodies from another world, musicianship from the top drawer, etc.  All on one of the best-produced albums I've ever heard from anybody.  Bob's not preaching with these songs, not any more or less than he ever has.  He's just telling stories and sharing himself, as always.  If you like Dylan, this music will stay with you forever, no matter your faith.
0780624890|4.0|Blade is hands down one of the best comic book movies to date, I think anybody who likes comics or even likes movies should see it. The DVD is also good, there isnt really any thing wrong with it. I mean it has everything a dvd should deleted scenes, commentary, and superb sound and picture. But nothing on the dvd really impressed me. That's why I didnt give it five stars. But if you like the movie and want it on dvd I'd say this is the way to go.
0446677450|4.0|I would certainly recommend this book to other people.  There was a decent amount of good information and it was written well.
B00004RJ74|5.0|This is the only movie I know of that has these two collaborating, and this movie is really good. This is an awesomelys cool movie, which I think is one of the best Vampire movies ever made. This movie is the writing of Tarantino mixed with the action and style of Rodriguez. Also, the DVD is awesome, with everything you can want in extras (two discs). There isnt one bad thing I can say about this dvd. Buy it!
B0001ZMWQO|5.0|Wow... from the first song to the last, Franz Ferdinand delivers a strong, solid medley of melody, beat and pure fun to their music. \\"Jacqueline\\" is arresting, and the sexy \\"Michael\\" is addictive. \\"Take Me Out,\\" the first single, is upbeat and so much fun to sing to, and the other songs provide great support. Alex Kapranos doesn't have the best voice in the world, but it does well with this music. Overall, great, great work. I'm going to have this CD on repeat for quite a while.
B00005JKWJ|5.0|This is an awesome sequel to Blade. This is a great movie. If you liked the first blade, buy this. Blade two is longer and has more action than blade one. Also, this dvd with two discs has a lot more than the dvd of the first blade movie. So I say if you like blade of just like comic book movies, you should buy this. You wont regret it.
B00007KWHG|5.0|Thoroughly enjoyed this album. <br />All the hits included here. <br />Would recommed this album to Frankie Valli Fans.
B0000027I6|5.0|I've always liked this type of alblum/CD where it all fits together. I've got the original alblum from when it first came out and tape, both worn out. When I played the CD it reminded me of when I first heard it. This like other CD products I've gotten from Amazon was high quality. If you just like Roger Waters, or Thick As A Brick, or Pink Floyd I'd say you would enjoy this very much. <br /> <br />David O.
B00005OAIE|5.0|John Mayer's uncanny ability to lyrically touch upon the many facets of falling in love has made me fall in love with him! <br /> <br />I love his acoustic guitar playing.  Overall, there's not a song on this album that I do not like.  Interesting fusion of jazz and ballard rock.   <br /> <br />After this album, I'm certainly a fan.
068484267X|5.0|I am re-reading this extraordinary book in anticipation of McCourt's forthcoming new book--the last in the trilogy that began with Angela's Ashes. The author's prose is simply stunning. Any writer or student of writing cannot help but be awed by the manner in which Mr. McCourt is able to express his thoughts so beautifully. As most people know, the story is about his youth in Ireland. And yet, it has an appeal to everybody, regardless of culture or background. This is a book I will keep in my library and never get rid of.
B000001A3H|5.0|kyuss is one of my absolute favorite bands of all time although i hav'nt heard \\"wretch\\" or \\"muchos gracias\\".\\"blues....\\" was my introduction w/ the video for \\"green machine\\" back in the early 90s' .a SLAMMER!!! & i might add an awsome song to drive to . anyway the rest of the album is loaded w/ atmospheric audio landscapes like \\"50 million mile trip\\",\\"800\\" & \\"freedom run\\".songs you can just get lost in. plus a few songs that at first may seem like filler,& maybe they were,but you can tell they were having fun & this helped them to grow on me pretty quick. kyuss have a knack for tapping your innerbeing. it's like a massage for your soul.kindda like \\"albatros\\" by Peter Greens fleetwood mac or \\"third stone from the sun\\" by Hendrix.it beats the sh*t out of pure moods......so buy it, it jams.
8408059688|3.0|I enjoyed most of this book, though at times I am a bit confused and lost on his discussion of energy of love..etc.  The alchemist is definitely easier to follow.  <br /> <br />I have read two of his other books - the Alchemist, which i think is over rated, and 11 Minutes.  I agree with the last two reviewers that he is in some way \\"proud\\" of himself. I felt at times in the Zahir that he is talking about himself - a successful writer who writes about love, life...etc.
B000063COX|3.0|This album is more raw and rough than the more polished albums that followed with Bruce Dickenson. <br /> <br />It's amazing how the chemistry of a band can change with a lineup change. <br /> <br />The album rocks, but unlike the Bruce years, I can't keep it on a loop and listen to it over and over. <br /> <br />Doesn't get nearly enough attention, but well worth a listen.
B00005JO0J|1.0|FIREFLY has only been around for a couple of years as a failed TV show on a 4th network, and now it's a failed feature film. It didn't connect or resonate with ANYBODY beyond a very limited (and primarily English-speaking) fanbase. And here's the cruelest cut -- I don't think it will stand the test of time. FIREFLY/SERENITY is too dependent on *other*, more popular creations for its context. It *needs* STAR TREK and STAR WARS to play off of. It's not so much an original creation as a parody/pastiche of more substantial works. Its referential humor and storytelling falls flat otherwise. <br /> <br />That's the problem with parody. It generally fades over time. And FIREFLY ain't none too popular to begin with. Besides, we  <br />already have a great star wars parody-Space Balls
B000002H2H|4.0|If you're an old-school Metallica fan, it's obvious that this one is a must have.  <br /> <br />Before they became huge and boring, they used to actually rock. Buy this one if you want to see what the bleeding edge of metal was like back in '84.
B0002S94OS|5.0|In a pond are fun for everyone. This band is really good. The guitarists are really good, maybe as good as me or better......but to top it all off Randall is a professional race car driver and can do 180's like it's nothing. Good Boy <br /> <br />I love you, Brot
B000067FP7|5.0|This movie made back in the 80s was a smash hit.  Directed by legendary film director Steven Spielberg.  This is one of the best movies ever made.  This dvd contains ten mintutes of footage that was cut from the final version of the movie. This was a great movie but was a real hasle to shoot. An  two commentaries about the film.  For thoose of you that liked that sequel thank the writters for rewritting the script.  If they had stuck to the original script the movie would have been more graphic and the sequel would not have been made.  This movie is about a  furry creature called a Mogwi.  That is senstive to sunlight and  multiples with water.  It lead to the creation of the pg13 rating.  This movie has a lot of violence and gory in it.  I do not recommend it to any one under 13 unlessed surpervised.  Can you young billy peletzer stop the Gremlins rampage or will Kingston Falls be utterlty destroyed.  Find out in the heart renching finale.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Though it is not needed to watch the recent movie adapted from it. The emotional connection you make to this excellent series makes the movie all that much better. The movie rates an \\"A\\" by itself, but if you watch the series, you'll make it an \\"A+.\\"
B0006399FS|5.0|Ignore all the bad reviews about this album. This album joins Achtung Baby, The Joshua Tree, and All That You Can't Leave Behind as one of U2's masterpieces. The negative reviews are from Green Day fans. Apparently, they got really bitter when Green Day lost to U2 in every category at this year's grammys. The single Vertigo beat whatever that Green Day song was. Well, just expect another speech by the band in next year's grammy's.
0307276902|5.0|WOW !!!!! I was unable to put this book down !!!!!! A must read !
B0007OCG56|3.0|The movie has many great moments, but it doesn't really build on them. Nothing really happens in the movie. The plot meanders. The relationships work sometimes. The movie does a good job of developing Tea's character as the psychotic wife. The viewer gets a fuller and fuller picture of her dysfuntionality as the movie goes on. However, her personality is all over the map and it is hard to get a good picture of her. Adam Sandler's character works as the super nice husband. The maid character is supposed to be sane, but never really works out that way. The daughter of the maid's voice over is really confusing sometimes and I don't think it helps much at all.  <br /> <br />The movie does score some very direct emotional and humourous hits, but it misses just as much. I enjoyed it, but is a rocky ride. The extras includes how to make \\"The world's best sandwich.\\" The commentaries were good too.  <br /> <br />
B00005YW4H|5.0|Norah Jones has the sweetest voice and pairs it with terrific ballads. This type of music is soothing to my soul and makes me feel like the world outside is suspended for a while.
B0002JJBZY|3.0|I got this set last December and slowly watched the episodes in order, after not having seen them for many, many years.  If you're buying this set, it's obvious that you already love the original series, so I won't spend time debating which are the greatest episodes, but they're all here, with a decent amount of bonus features to boot, including a dedicated \\"Life After Trek\\" for each main cast member, interviews with the writers and producers, and text commentary from writers on selected episodes (typically the Okudas).  The episodes are in air-date order, rather than production order; I don't know if this is a bone of contention with die-hard fans.   <br /> <br />I give this DVD set 3 stars and not 5 because: <br />-I would have liked more bonus footage (gag reel? outtakes, deleted scenes? Shatner performing Rocket Man?) <br />-better film cleanup was needed for some of the episodes.  Some are excellent, and the color looks great across the board, but you can see that the film is dirty/damaged in some places.  There is one stock shot they use all the time which is really filthy (the Enterprise circling a planet). <br />-TOO EXPENSIVE!!!  Paramount needs to find a way to make their trek stuff FAR CHEAPER!
B00005JO0J|4.0|It would be pretty easy for me to bash SERENITY to pieces during this review ...but I won't. The bashings, as some folks here have already pointed out, can be directed at the lack of advancement in language, limited projectile-type weaponry, and a microcosmic-society inside the spaceship SERENITY that have reverted back to the cowboy-shoot `em-up days.<br /><br />It could also be considered cliche-riddled with the lone-type gunslinger fighting against far superior numbers and odds, only to win and change the course of everything.<br /><br />But again, I'm not going to bash these things. So you may be asking, \\"Why?\\" Well ...because it works. The film is not really meant to break any new science fiction movie-making ground. It's designed to be entertaining, with exciting gun-battles, eye-popping CGI, and characters who are great to watch. From Mal, SERENITY'S captain who holds a grudge against the all-powerful Alliance, to the beautiful but lethal River, who can become a killing machine with the utterance of one word, all of SERENITY'S crew have to battle their pasts and presents and, sometimes, even themselves.<br /><br />The other thing that made the film fun and easy to watch was the snappy dialogue and frequent use of humor during extreme situations. One scene that comes to mind even now is when River escapes from SERENITY'S brig and takes control of the bridge. Once Mal finds out where she is, he rushes up there to find her typing in coordinates and she quickly draws a weapon on him. Mal says, \\"You know, I trusted that you were a human being, at least somewhere in there you were. And my crew trusted me on that. So if you're not you might as well shoot me now.\\" &lt;click> sounds as she cocks her weapon. Mal swallows, \\"Or we could just talk some more,\\" he says quickly.<br /><br />It's really great to see comedy in science fiction (not since GALAXY QUEST have I enjoyed listening to this type of dialogue).<br /><br />So don't worry about the cliche's or the common plot.

B0002OERI0|5.0|Green Day is back after a four-year wait. And their album is better than ever. Their most inspirational album since \\"Dookie\\", American Idiot is a hard-rock core album that will blow your minds away. <br /> <br />1: American Idiot- 8/10, A good song altogether and their first release. It should have been more of a bang. However, it is still one of the worst songs on the album. Listen to this after listening to everything else to wrap it up. DO NOT JUDGE THE ALBLUM ON THIS ONE SONG. <br /> <br />2: Jesus of Suburbia- 9/10, This super-long, four part song is a very punkish theme type. You can listen to this and love it, or just hate it. IN my case I liked it, but I would take this over American Idiot. <br /> <br />3: Holiday- 10/10, Now this is awesome. \\"Holiday\\" is a superb song for rock fans. The song is about people in a war or something. The end is just great. <br /> <br />4: Boulevard of Broken Dreams- 10/10, Great song, very unique for Green Day. This song is for everyone, and it's Billy Joe Armostrong at his best. slow tuners and rockers agree on this great hit. <br /> <br />5: Are We The Waiting- 8/10, I say this is an average song. NOt much else to say. <br /> <br />6: St. Jimmy- 9/10, Totally green Day. pure solid rock and Green Day as it's best. <br /> <br />7: Give Me Novecane- 10/10, awesome, slow rock tune for the ages. nice beat and great tunes. <br /> <br />8: She's A Rebel- 8/10, not much to say about it (just like are we the waiting), this is one of those fast, ordinary songs for Green day. <br /> <br />9: Extraordinary Girl- 8/10, hm.........cant say anything on this. it stikes my mind again why i don't listen to this song ever. <br /> <br />10: Letterbomb-11/10, THIS IS PURE, AWESOME ROCK. I loved this like crazy first time i heard this. It could turn a dull party to the party of the century. some of the best rock ever heard from green day and the second best on this album. <br /> <br />11: Wake me up when september ends- 12/10, emotional as ever, some people cry when they hear this. they break away when they see the video. green day breaks away from the \\"american idiot\\" them in this soulful, emotional song delvivered superbly by b.j armstrong. <br /> <br />12: Whatsername- 9/10, listen to this average song for ages and it will never get old.  <br /> <br />American Idiot was one of the biggest hits of '04. Green Day has solidified their place in music history even more with \\"Idiot\\". love green day for this hit, and covet it.

B0009YA386|4.0|Editors stormed on the UK music scene in early 2005 with the single \\"Bullets\\", and haven't looked back since. The band's sound is reminiscent of Echo and the Bunnymen and Interpol (I played the CD to my 15 yr. old daughter and after 2 songs she said \\"hey, this sounds like Interpol\\", and she meant it as a compliment).<br /><br />\\"The Back Room\\" (11 tracks, 43 min.) starts off with a 2'30 min. blazing \\"Lights\\", with lead singer Tom Smith proclaiming \\"I've Got A Million Things To Say\\", and boy, do they ever. Outstanding songs follow: \\"Munich\\" (the second single) is mesmerizing, \\"Blood\\" (third single) is almost danceable, in a dark kinda way. Other highlights include \\"All Sparks\\", the epic \\"Open Your Arms\\" and the closer \\"Distance\\", but there really isn't a weak track on the album. \\"Bullets\\" has just been re-released in the UK as a single, and you can just feel this band is going places.<br /><br />Many have commented that this album is the UK's response to Interpol's \\"Turn on the Bright Lights\\", and I have to agree. This is a near-perfect album, drenched with urgency from beginning to end, just beautiful. It begs the question not if but when this album will find a US release and a US audience. \\"The Back Room\\" is easily one of the best albums of 2005. Highly recommended!
B000B2YQX4|5.0|\\"Playing the Angel\\" is now one of my favorites! The sound is alot like thier others ones, but more dark and Saddness into the music. Martin L. Gore has a way to express his \\"precious\\" Wife (recently divorce) his #5 song on how much he loved her but she would not tell him what was wrong. (I watch a interview about thier Lyrics/music) I was sad to hear about his breakup. :(... without his emotion this CD wouldnt be as good. in my opinion, Depeche Mode is doing great so far!
0307276902|5.0|The progression of this story has been for me, intoxicating with excitment and enthusiasm.  It left me with wanting more, somewhat like the \\"authors prior addiction\\". I just couldn't get enough of his story and wanted it to go on and on and on.  <br /> <br />I am now looking forward to his next book.  I honestly wish the very best for John Frey; and hope, he now believes in a \\"Higher Power\\". <br /> <br />
B000006IUQ|4.0|I really enjoy this film because of the rawness of the film.  A large portion of the film only contains scenes with Alec Baldwin and Anthony Hopkins, and of course a very large bear.  Lots of Scenes from a the woods in the winter time.  After a plane crash the main characters are forced to find a way to survive in the wilderness as they make their way back to civilization.  In walks a man killing bear who stalks them and this movie really becomes a great man vs nature film and story.  I recommend it for any balwin or hopkins fans, as well as anyone who likes simple films with few characters and real human emotion, trials, and growth.
0141301074|5.0|Roald Dahl again delivers a fantastic, witty, funny hit, The Twits, which chronicles the lives of Mr. and Mrs. Twit and their angry monkeys. <br /> <br />Mr. and Mrs. Twit are a married couple who are two of the ugliest people you could imagine. Dahl starts off the book talking about hairy people and ends it talking about a deadly disease. <br /> <br />Pure genius. <br /> <br />You'll love this book for the content of the mean, nasty tricks that the Twits do to each other and the monkeys witful pranks to get revenge on the Twits. It's a great book for ages five to nine, and a great read-aloud book.  <br /> <br />I reccomend this book to any child seeking a challenge from easy, picture books or anyone who wants a funny break from long, romance novels.
0060825219|2.0|I agree with the previous review that the writing is excellent but this story just reeks of arrogance.  The author leaves the plot at time to run tangents about what seem to be his own writing and interactions.  These tangents are so self-righteous its ridiculous.  All in all not nearly the best of Coelho.  Quick, easy read though.
0375760067|3.0|Set in fictitious Casterbridge (Hardy's beloved Dorchester), the story evolves from the web of deceit spun by pride and drink--with serious consequences 20 years later.  Traveling by foot with his stoic wife and baby girl, hay-trusser Michael Henchard arrives in Weydon-Priors during its annual fair.  Having drunk too much laced furmity he makes an astounding offer to those gathered in the tent: he will auction off the unvalued females to the highest bidder!  Fate protects poor Susan and Elizabeth Jane as the only bidder proves a decent sailor named Newsome.  The simple-minded woman does not realize that such a contract is not binding, but remains with him--even emigrating to Canada for 18 years--until his reported death at sea.<br /><br />  Somewhat sobered the next day Henchard feels deep remorse--to the extent that he enters an empty church and swears abstinence for 21 years in penance.  Arriving in the major city of Casterbridge-site of ancient Roman ruins and some lugubrious customs-he works his way up in Society until he becomes a respected grain merchant and eventually the mayor.  Though unwed he had a dalliance on the island of Jersey with a local girl named Lucetta, who nursed him through an illness--thus compromising her own reputation.<br /><br />  The wheels of fate are grinding away when Susan and Elizabeth Jane-who may not be his daughter after all-arrive in Casterbridge.  The latter has been raised in ignorance of the auction and Henchard's role in her life, but her mother is nervous, desiring to appeal to him quietly before deciding her next course of action and residence.  On the eve of a big feast in town another newcomer arrives: a young Scotsman named Donald Farfrae, en route to Canada himself.  Taking an immediate liking to the smart young fellow, Henchard convinces him to stay on and serve as his manager.  Thus Hardy sets in motion the literary mechanism of a complicated plot: two men courting one woman; two women who are attracted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.<br /><br />  There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles.  Tragedy perhaps, pathos definitely.  Hardy highlights the often unfair role of women in his society, set against a backdrop of snobbery, poverty, a strict class system and an undercurrent of superstition. A bit grim but satisfying for devotees of 19th century British literature.cted to one man and eventually two men claiming to be Elizabeth Jane's father.   <br /> <br />       There is a sense of fatalism in many of Hardy's novels; his characters strive against their destiny (the result of poor choices, as well as untoward coincidences) but they seem compelled to play out their dismal roles.

B0006L16N8|3.0|Coldplay seem to have become the whipping boys of many music fans who feel that the band have settled into a sort of complacent, over-earnest, &#34;rock for bedwetters&#34; sound. If you can only take your rock drenched in booze and ball-sweat, they're probably not for you. Coldplay take you on a far different journey.  To me, Coldplay have never been a serious artistic force to be reckoned with, but they've written some fine tunes in their time. Certainly the U2 comparisons are warranted on this album, but think in terms of sorrowful &#34;With or Without You&#34; ballads or maybe &#34;New Years Day.&#34; The strongest track here is the morose &#34;X&Y.&#34; If you like anything this band has done, you probably shouldn't let that one slip by. &#34;Fix You&#34; is the crowd pleaser. It begins with Chris Martin singing softly over organ and piano driven verses until it breaks into the type of stadium-anthem chorus sure to inspire the ignition of cigarette lighters in a live setting.  As with Coldplay's other CDs, the guitars chime with that anthemic skyward element mostly associated with U2's The Edge. Chris Martin's warm vocal delivery stretches from aching tenor to falsetto on a consistent basis. Meanwhile, his piano playing soothes and seldom overpowers.  If you are a Coldplay fan, I don't see how you can listen to this and not eventually notice an improvement over A Rush of Blood to the Head. The only thing that Coldplay could stand to work on is developing a little more of a bite, sonically or lyrically. They are too precious, but in a way that's inviting.
0790751305|4.0|Unforgiven is a Western that doesn't have all the quick shoot-em-up bang-bang, the bad guys are dead.  Instead, Clint Eastwood has produced, directed, and starred in a piece that is both incredibly sensitive and has some of the sheerest brutality I have ever seen in a film, Western or otherwise.<br /><br />There is some grade-A talent, including Morgan Freeman as William Munny's (Eastwood) old partner in crime, Ned Logan.  Gene Hackman is Little Bill, a sheriff who runs his town like a moralizing despot, using bad means to achieve good ends. And the great Richard Harris plays an outlaw called English Bob, who runs into the bad side of Little Bill.<br /><br />The story is about a group of prostitutes who put out a bounty of a thousand dollars for two cowboys who cut up the face of one of the women.  Munny leaves his solitary life to collect the bounty when a brash young gunfighter asks to partner with him.  The whores, eager to avenge their friend's disfigurement, do not know they are about to bring a demon, Death on a Pale Horse, down upon the town.<br /><br />This film is difficult to watch in places.  The characters are complex and if you are aware you are a sinner, you will be scared sh**less.
0141301066|5.0|\\"Matilda\\" is a magical, funny book for kids nine to thirteen years old. Matilda is a nice, smart, girl whose parents think she is stupid. <br /> <br />You will love all the characters from Matilda, to Miss Honey, to the mean old Trunchbull. It's the magic of Dahl that makes \\"Matilda\\" a classic tale for all kids. Matilda is a great reader and loves books probablly more than her despicable family.  <br /> <br />The Trunchbull (Matilda's principal and her father's customer), is a mean old lady who you will learn to hate as much as you will love Matilda. <br /> <br />I reccomend \\"Matilda\\" to any child growing up, or anyone wanting a smart but funny book.
B0002OERI0|1.0|From the very title of this album, you might think that Green Day might back up their claim with their music, man, they were always a pop band, and they could never go deep as to title their album american idiot. If you like pop and like following the masses like a true american idiot then buy this album. I always thought Green Day were posers, they do not offer anything new to the musical landscape, that's why they are pop.<br /><br />I go out of my way to review a pop album because I'm just pissed at all the credit they get for their crap.
067144901X|5.0|I received a set of 4 Sandra Boynton books 9 years ago when I was pregnant with my first child.  They captivated my firstborn and each child since him.  In fact, the books are not just for babies - Moo Baa La La La is still going strong for teaching beginning reading skills to my youngest.<br /><br />Moo Baa La La La really DOES invite parents to let down their guard and ham it up while reading, even new parents who might feel self-conscious or reserved reading to a baby.  And it DOES get lots of smiles and laughter from young children.<br /><br />You can't go wrong with this book.
B0000AUHOH|3.0|Agreeably not one of the better Star Trek films. I got it just so that I would have a complete set of the original casts movies in my dvd collection. I think this is the one that William Shatner strong armed the producers so that he could direct after the truly awesome job that Leonard Nimoy did n his directorial debut. Just hope that William Shatner will stick to acting and leave directing alone.
B000025SJ8|1.0|I don't understand the hype over Burzum. I bought this only because of the good reviews, and what a disappointment. The musicianship is awful, the vocals sound like a pre-school girl who got her toy taken away by some other kid. Varg's feminine wailing sounds like his boyfriend in prison is going at him again. What a waste of money. Better spent on something else, anything else!
B00005T30L|5.0|Daniel Clowes the creator of the book and Terry Zwigoff who brought the story to film have in essence produced a modern version of J. D. Salinger's novel: The Catcher in the Rye. Daniel Clowes writes that his book was based on the observations of two young women and almost two generations after Salinger's original publication, it seems there still exists a Ghost World between adolescence and adulthood where once in awhile a vulnerable spirit gets lost. Terry's film adaptation and the two young women who play the leads perfectly capture the soul of Daniel's story. <br />     The film opens with two nihilistic young women attending their high school graduation, but only Rebecca receives her diploma. And this seems to be the heart of their impending separation. While Rebecca adapts to the changes, Enid caroms through life, spreading her own special brand of chaos even as she yearns to connect with those around her. But she is filled with a nihilism that often finds her not showing up to pivotal events in her expected metamorphic transformation. So she fails to complete the milestones that will help her achieve maturity and humanize her ego.  <br />    Throughout the story Enid appears to be completely out of step with everyone around her, it is almost as if she is operating on a different frequency. In her nihilistic behavior she alters the psyche of those she meets, and then leaves them to sort out the consequences of their having interacted with a childish element; Rebecca's assimilation into humanity serves to highlight Enid's fading away... <br />     It pains the heart to watch Enid as she slowly disappears into this ghost world, until there is nothing left for her to do but pack her bag and go to a place where there is no past defining her or emotional expectations from those who have grown up with her, and perhaps it is these absences which will allow Enid to connect to the person she is meant to be. <br />     A great deal of love has been invested in thestory and the film. Almost every scene is layered with multiple meanings and quirky visual treats. An example is when Enid arrives extremely late to school to turn in her application to art college and interrupts two teachers fitting a death mask over a students face... Another is when a female friend of her father's suddenly reappears in their lives and says to Enid: \\"I have an interest in you because I like to think I had something to do with who you have become.\\" Given the turmoil in Enid's life and the obvious revulsion she holds for this strange woman, the story almost becomes a horror film. <br />     Ultimately Ghost Story is a poignant look at how some people get lost on their way to adulthood, and leaves us rooting for Enid, hoping that she will somehow become a human being while giving us a greater understanding of our own lives.  <br /> <br />
B0001MDP3G|5.0|North Carolina author Charles Frazier's book gripped me and was a moving tale.  When I saw the film, the story came flooding back like a lost acquaintance.  I saw the film 3 times in the theatre, bought the DVD and have watched that multiple times.  I connect with this movie.  It is one of my favorite films.  The many aspects of the film come together for me to make it more than the sum of its parts: more than a tale of romance, or the Civil War, or an epic journey, or even a political film touching on abuse of power.<br /><br />Anthony Minghella who won the Oscar as Best Director of \\"The English Patient,\\" served as executive director for another film starring Nicole Kidman (\\"The Interpreter\\"), and directed and was nominated for the Oscar for Best Adapted Screenplay for \\"The Talented Mr. Ripley\\" that starred Jude Law, does a masterful job with combining these elements.  Gabriel Yared's Oscar-nominated  gorgeous musical score and John Seale's Oscar-nominated  breathtaking cinematography give the picture both sonic and visual elegance.  Best Songs Oscar nominees by T-Bone Burnett and Elvis Costello along with Jack White gave the film authentic mountain music.  The images of the snow and the swooping crows are some of the most memorable film visuals for me, like watching moving paintings.<br /><br />Some have said that the chemistry between Nicole Kidman and Jude Law didn't work.  I find that amazing since it played so well for me!  They don't have many scenes together, but the attraction and their separation in coming together were breathtaking.  While Jude Law was actually rooting for Sean Penn to win the Oscar for \\"Mystic River,\\" -- not to take anything away from Penn -- I rooted for his controlled, muted, and intensely brooding performance.  Jude Law as  Inman was one of the best performances I've seen and recalls the strength to internalize of another excellent actor, Paul Newman.  When Law finally connects in that cabin and says, \\"I marry you; I marry you; I marry you,\\" it is one of the most incredible screen moments.<br /><br />Nicole Kidman's portrayal of Southern belle Ada Monroe who knows how to speak foreign languages and play piano but has no idea what to do with a chicken or how to plant vegetables is excellent.  She reaches many emotional levels from the grief she feels over the loss of her father to her attraction to Inman to the endless waiting and uncertainty to hardships of wartime and fending off the advances of Teague.  She well deserved her Oscar nomination.<br /><br />Rene Zellweger as Ruby plays it broad and bubbly.  She is a bright light of the film giving it common sense, practicality, and humor.  In all of her work that I've seen from \\"The Cinderella Man\\" to \\"Bridget Jones' Diary,\\" to \\"Chicago,\\" Ruby is her most distinctive character; and Zellweger well deserved her Best Supporting Actress Oscar.<br /><br />I watched \\"Closer,\\" the Mike Nichols film that stars Natalie Portman and Jude Law, and then watched \\"Cold Mountain\\" which has Portman in a cameo as Sara whose baby Ethan is sick and whose husband has been killed.  It's interesting to see the two together in these two different films.<br /><br />Law comes upon Sara, spends the night and at her invitation slips platonically into her bed.  When the Yankee soldiers come to rob her, Law saves her.  The DVD deleted scene shows Law strapping the soldiers' bodies to the horses, sending them away, the baby's death and Sara's suicide.  Having seen the film about 6 times before watching the deleted scenes, I think it made Inman's return to Ada all the more powerful as we think he had other choices that he did not pursue.  But it does make the DVD scene quite interesting.<br /><br />Ray Winstone who was in the Clive Owen \\"King Arthur\\" does a good job as the revolting Teague who hunts down & kills deserters.  Ethan Suplee's performance as the heavyset mandolin player is priceless as we see his simple character not understand that he is about to be killed.  Jack White of White Stripes plays Georgia, the boy that eventually marries Ruby.  Donald Sutherland who is one of my favorite underrated actors has a nice cameo as the Reverend Monroe.  Kathy Baker from TV's \\"Picket Fences\\" has a strong supporting part as Sally Swanger.  Phillip Seymour Hoffman as Reverend Veasey has a nice supporting role as the constipated man of the cloth that is weak in ways of the flesh.  Giovanni Ribisi as Junior who lures the convicts to his house full of women and then turns them over to the soldiers has a nice cameo.  The woman who plays the lady with goats also does a nice job as does the creepy young blond bounty hunter.  \\"Cold Mountain\\" is one of those films that moves me each time I watch it.  The story, the performance, the look and feel of the film all make me say, \\"Bravo!\\"e killed.  Jack White of White Stripes plays Georgia, the boy that eventually marries Ruby.

0307276902|4.0|This is a new in sightful look into addiction and the decision, process and effort required to become clean and sober.  The verbage is not what I personally use but if the words were changed the message of the book would be lost or changed.  Be prepared to feel the author's feelings as you read this book.  An interesting style of writing but tells  the story effectively with soul bearing honesty. This book deals with FEELINGS in a head on manner.  I could not wait to read the sequel \\"MY FRIEND LEONARD\\".  I look forward to more books by James Frey.              R. Pinney
B00005JNTX|5.0|Sin City is a highly artistic rendition of a somewhat popular comic book series.  I have never read the comic books, but I really enjoyed the movie.  The use of black and white with splashes of color to focus the viewer is very powerful.  Also, the characters are complete hyperbole.  They are stylized, comic book creations done in flesh.  This is a great movie.  It is violent, it is gritty, and it is totally non-traditional.
B000AP04FG|5.0|One of the best films of 2005!! The chemistry is great between Pitt and Jolie(maybe becouse they are seeing each other in real life).

The plot is good everything about this movie is good.
B0009I7NNA|5.0|I don't listen to death metal.  Therefore I like this cd.  Great guitar work.  Good vocals that fit the music.  Exactly what I was expecting when I heard Bat Country on the radio and said \\"I should buy that cd.\\"  Screaming takes no talent at all.  Singing does.  Great purchase for anyone who prefers melody in their metal, like me.  Bad purchase for anyone who prefers to not tell the difference between songs.

B000001F3C|5.0|You can say what you will about U2 and their youthful exuberance and, at times, pretensions, but there is no way to deny their third album's power. Quite frankly, it has two of the most brilliant songs to emerge from the early 80's with \\"Sunday Bloody Sunday\\" and \\"New Year's Day.\\" Growing up in an embattled Ireland gave them the visions that came forth on \\"War,\\" and the tastes of success gave them the brass to venture into the political realm. Like on the band's first two albums, the mix of secular and sacred gave the album a sense of conflict that fuels all the great rock albums. \\"Too right, to be wrong in this rebel song,\\" Bono wails in \\"Like a Song,\\" and more so than the Sex Pistols ever could, they meant it, maaaannnn.<br /><br />But even with those two anthems to carry it, \\"War\\" had treasures that often go unheralded. \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" was actually a single of the album, and probably got as much airplay as \\"NYD\\" did. The martial drums of \\"The Refugee\\" are propulsively catchy, and the tasty balladry of \\"Drowning Man\\" remains un undiscovered gem in U2's catalog.<br /><br />But by now, the band was becoming increasingly popular by both the nature of their music and their larger than life concerts. This was the period when Bono was usually found climbing rafters to wave his giant white flag, and music fans looking for groups with passion and commitment, as well as a social conscious, were jumping on board en masse. \\"War's\\" closing number, the biblically inspired \\"40,\\" was the kind of uplift that the band and its fans embraced. Other than The Clash (who were beginning to unravel about this time), no one else even came close to delivering the kind of excitement that U2 did.<br /><br />(While we're at it, why has this album and the U2 catalog not been upgraded? U2 are easily one of the best and most influential bands on the planet, and their early albums deserve more than to have shoddy liner notes and a late 80's quality CD transfer.)

0786852550|5.0|Bartimaus-the real star of this book offers one of the most refreshing experiences in a long time. In ways that slyly derive from the cliched genie story, Barty and his comments (almst characters in their own right) fill up this book. <br /> <br />With Nathaniel, Stroud also explores themes of right and wrong. Presenting the magicians running the government as a parody of the world we live in, this novel, set in an alternate Victorian England where magic runs rampant, reflects the modern world in subtle and cruel ways. Nat, a young magician forced to make the choice between fame and nobility is left hanging by the last threads of a concience so faulty it is almost non-existent. <br /> <br />This book will make you laugh at loud, think, and desperately wish for more!

0679422714|3.0|This book contains 1000's of facts which together confirm that Mao was paranoid, undercut rivals before they became rivals, had perhaps the biggest ego this side of the 19th century and for the most part made it all up as he went along.  If only those same facts could have been presented by the authors without the authors revealing, from page one, that they have an axe to grind.  Kudos to the authors for digging so deep and tapping into so many original sources.   But they also tip their hand too often, and give one the sense that their sources revealed to them just what they expected to find.  In short, I doubted the authors' objectivity, and that spoiled the book for me.
B000AADYRQ|5.0|I first gave Death Cab a listen when my boyfriend at the time told me I should. He let me borrow \\"Transatlanticism\\" and at first listen, I wasn't too interested. But after a long time analyzing the lyrics and music I came to love it. I was so excited to hear they were coming out with a new cd. So I got it ASAP. And I knew they switched to a major label, but I don't think the label switch had anything to do with the different style and type of music on the cd. If you listen to The Photo Album and then listen to Transatlanticism, there is a large difference in the music style. DCFC simply matured their sound. Transatlanticism as a whole tells a better story, but Plans is an amazing cd. If you just listen to the style, you won't like it too much. But the lyrics very much fit the style of music and the soudn quality is a lot better. I love it.

B00005AQE8|5.0|2Pac is one of the most influential rappers ever in this world. Even though he's dead, many people respect him as a great rapper and a great actor. And this classic album \\"All Eyez On Me\\" proves why he was so great. It's recognized as a classic in many genres - Gangsta Rap, West Coast Rap, G-Funk and Hardcore Rap. Even if you're not into G-Funk or West Coast Rap, you must listen to this permanent classic. It's loved by everybody and also the first rap double-album. <br /> <br />Disc 1 <br /> <br />1. Ambitionz Az A Ridah (5/5) - CLASSIC. Daz produced it and 2Pac does it crazy on this one. The hook is really addictive and catchy. <br /> <br />2. All About U (5/5) - It's one of the most popular songs on this album. Snoop Dogg on the outro, Nate Dogg sings the chorus, and Fatal and Yaki Kadafi of Outlawz rap with 2Pac. Great sample from Cameo's \\"Candy\\". <br /> <br />3. Skandalouz (5/5) - Daz produced it and Nate Dogg featured on it. Very addictive beat and the lyrics are interesting. <br /> <br />4. Got My Mind Made Up (5/5) - It's like a West-East collaboration song. Tha Dogg Pound from the West and Redman & Method Man from the East make this song great. <br /> <br />5. How Do You Want It (5/5) - Ranked 1st on the Billboard Single Chart. K-Ci & JoJo featured on it and 2Pac drops it crazily. Everybody would love this song. <br /> <br />6. 2 Of Amerikaz Most Wanted (5/5) - CLASSIC. Daz produced it and Snoop featured on it. This track is one of the most gangsta tracks on this album and 2Pac & Snoop both drop some bombs. <br /> <br />7. No More Pain (4/5) - Very dismal song. I would give 5 stars if it were not too long. 2Pac quotes the notorious line \\"I came to bring the pain / Hardcore to the brain\\" from Method Man's \\"Bring Da Pain\\". <br /> <br />8. Heartz Of Men (5/5) - DJ Quik produced it. The beat is fresh and 2Pac raps really well on this one. You can notice how Quik's beat can be fresh on it. <br /> <br />9. Life Goes On (5/5) - It's very popular, too. Not only in America, but in every other country. 2Pac dedicated this song to his friend Mental and Kato. The mood is sad. <br /> <br />10. Only God Can Judge Me (5/5) - Great G-Funk track. Rappin' 4-Tay featured on it. They both rap well and if you're deep into G-Funk, you'll definitely love it. <br /> <br />11. Tradin War Stories (5/5) - A serious-mood song. Outlawz, CPO and Storm featured on it. Contains a sample from James Brown's \\"It's A Man's Man's World\\". <br /> <br />12. California Love (RMX) (5/5) - Dr. Dre produced, mixed it and featured on it and Roger Troutman on Talkbox. Actually the original version of this song is better but for a G-Funk fan, it's a treasure. <br /> <br />13. I Ain't Mad At Cha (5/5) - CLASSIC. Danny Boy featured on it. 2Pac raps truly as if he were writing a letter on this Daz-produced song. Perfect sample from DeBarge's \\"A Dream\\". <br /> <br />14. What's Ya Phone Number (4/5) - Good. 2Pac raps well and Danny Boy sings well, too. But it's too long. 2Pac only raps 2 verses and the outro which 2Pac and a woman talk is too long and it gradually makes you get bored. <br /> <br />CD 2 <br /> <br />1. Can't C Me (5/5) - CLASSIC. Dr. Dre produced it so gangsta and funky. Even George Clinton did the additional vocals. Perfect sample from Funkadelic's \\"(Not Just) Knee Deep\\". Well, Dr. Dre sampled this song 4 times but this is the best of them. <br /> <br />2. Shorty Wanna Be A Thug (5/5) - The beat and lyrics are kinda sad. So the mood is sad, too. Very meaningful song. You've got to listen to this song at least than once. <br /> <br />3. Holla At Me (5/5) - The mood is a little bit down but very bouncy. 2Pac's rapping is crazy again and the chorus is catchy. <br /> <br />4. Wonda Why They Call U B**** (5/5) - Typcial G-Funk track. It's a great song that contains 2Pac's great story. Very addictive. <br /> <br />5. When We Ride (5/5) - Outlawz Immortalz featured on it and DJ Pooh produced it. This beat and lyrics are very gangsta. <br /> <br />6. Thug Passion (5/5) - It feels kinda comfortable. Maybe it's because it contains a great sample from Zapp & Roger's \\"Computer Love\\". <br /> <br />7. Picture Me Rollin' (5/5) - This song is similar to 2Pac's \\"Death Around The Corner\\". But this is much better than that. Great sample from Kool & The Gang's \\"Winter Sadness\\". <br /> <br />8. Check Out Time (5/5) - One of the most comfortable song. Kurupt and Big Syke featured on it. The lyrics are kinda interesting and the beat is perfect. <br /> <br />9. Ratha Be Ya N**** (5/5) - Richie Rich featured on it. It's gangsta-love song. Creative sample from Bootsy Collins' \\"I'd Rather Be With You\\". <br /> <br />10. All Eyez On Me (5/5) - Big Syke featured on it. 2Pac dissed Nas because Nas's \\"Street Dreams\\" was almost the same with this song. <br /> <br />11. Run Tha Streetz (5/5) - CLASSIC. Typcial smooth G-Funk song. Michel'le sings great and Mutha and Storm rap well, too. One of the smoothest G-Funk tracks ever. <br /> <br />12. Ain't Hard To Find (5/5) - E-40, B-Legit, C-Bo and Richie Rich featured on it. They all go well with 2Pac and the beat is kinda gangsta and addictive. <br /> <br />13. Heaven Ain't Hard To Find (5/5) - Perfect song to finish this album. Quincy Jones' son QDIII produced it. 2Pac's rapping is the best on this one. Cotains a sample from Bobby Caldwell's \\"What You Won't Do For Love\\". <br /> <br />I'm Korean who's only 15 and recommending this G-Funk classic to everyone. This album will make your ears hot.
B0007GAEW6|5.0|It would be very tempting to wax philisophical about the true meaning of this albums' lyrics, but since I don't speak much Spanish and have listened to \\"Frances....\\" at least twice a week since it's release, I don't want to over analyze it, I will simply say it rocks harder,longer and more challenging than anything else released this year. I can actually enjoy this music for its aesthetic, aural beauty without deciphering the \\"concept\\" or claiming to fully understand how each piece is connected. I will say this, cryptic lyrics, random, found sounds,<br /><br />long passages of silence and some of the best ensemble playing by any rock band I've ever heard make this latest outing by the Mars Volta a true listening experience that rewards me with something new everytime I spin it. While this LP may be daunting to close minded listeners, the rest of us will be enjoying this challenging, excessive, run on musical sentence for ages and waiting to have our heads twisted by the next release. Don't overthink it,just open your mind, have a few drinks and let it sink in.
B000003CKH|4.0|I love the band, but when I listen to them I have to admit I make my own compilation out their CD's because their albums just aren't strong all the way through.   In my opinion this is their strongest album overall. It's the only one I STILL enjoy listening to all the way through after years of owning it.  This is the album I would recommend if someone way buying their first Cake album.

B0002S94OS|5.0|The only band to come out in the last 5 years that belongs in the company of Pantera, Slayer and old school Metallica.   <br /> <br />Some people are going to group them with the entire new wave of metal that often uses clean vocals.  This is similar to those acts, but never goes the emo route with vocals.  Sometimes the guitars go melodic in a way similar to in flames, but they manage to be slightly more slayeresque. <br /> <br />They're brutal, catchy and sincere.  The vocals, drums and guitar are all outstanding. Basically, I see them as a reincarnation of Pantera for the new wave of metal. <br /> <br />

0307276902|5.0|A kind of book you can't put down.  Very riveting account of one man's life and almost death from addictions.  Anyone that can come out of that kind of a world must be well commended.  As I have lived with a person with addictions for many year until his death being sober, I can relate to many things that happended to James and the people who loved him.

B00005JNBQ|5.0|I am absolutely in love with this movie. If you grew up in the 80's or early 90's then you can relate to the dialogue, and the various situations (reading a current event, being part of a \\"happy hands\\" club) that occur in this kid's school. The directors do such a great job in making the set and the dialogue as authentic as possible. This movie puts me straight back into my childhood every time Napoleon calls someone a \\"friggin idiot\\" or \\"retarded\\". If you can't relate to the humor, you will have a hard time watching Napoleon Dynamite. This style of movie isn't fast enough for a lot of viewers, and with an absence of a direct plot can make it that much more difficult. In my opinion, the style is refreshing and includes wonderful actors who carry it off brilliantly!
B0006L16N8|3.0|This album hits the spot nicely, and I was pleasantly surprised by it - at first. <br /> <br />Then I started hearing it everywhere; it seems no one can produce a television show, film a commercial, or run a coffeeshop without using a track (or ten) from X&Y.  If Chris Martin & Co were looking to create a soundtrack to life in 2005, they succeeded.   <br /> <br />My advice is to skip the purchase and just walk into your local Barnes and Noble - you're sure to hear it.   <br /> <br />It's a good album, but it's wearing thin.

0740748475|5.0|Readers were first introduced to Calvin and Hobbes in 1985, when the balloon-headed little blond boy went out to trap a tiger in his suburban neighborhood, using a tuna fish sandwich as bait. That tiger was Hobbes, a stuffed tiger who transformed into the real thing when beside Calvin.<br /><br />This began a strange and sweet friendship. We have Calvin, the hyperintelligent and sassy six-year-old, who lives half his life in a dream world of aliens, dinosaurs, time travel, carnivorous snowmen, under-the-bed monsters and much more. And then there's stuffed toy Hobbes, the voice of reason who acts as a counterpoint, best buddy and coconspirator.<br /><br />They climb trees, sled, fish, jeer at girls, and try to fly together -- usually with comical results. Occasionally they journey to Mars or back in time, cut Calvin's hair, or flood the upstairs of their house. And of course, Calvin causes mayhem at school by mangling the Pledge of Allegience and asking tough philosophical questions about freedom.<br /><br />And Watterson occasionally drop the comic tone for a more sentimental one: In one particularly moving story, the house is burgled while the family is away. Fearing that Hobbes has been stolen. Calvin goes on a desperate search for his toy friend. \\"Well, I think he's valuable,\\" he sniffs forlornly, echoing any little kid who might have lost his toy.<br /><br />Bill Watterson was in his late twenties when he began \\"Calvin and Hobbes,\\" but he clearly still remembered what it was like to be a kid. Who hasn't seen their teacher as a hideous, bloblike monster? Or seen a doctor's visit as a torture session by aliens? (\\"Kid, don't make me recant the Hippocratic Oath!\\")<br /><br />But those two characters can't make up the whole strip by themselves. There are many others, like Calvin's long-suffering parents, who love their kid but are driven completely crazy by his bizarre behavior. Then there is Susie, the girl that Calvin subconsciously likes, Miss Wormwood the sour teacher, and Rosalyn the overstressed babysitter.<br /><br />Aside from the excellent quality of the books in this slipcase, the chronological arrangement allows fans to see the characters and the art evolve. Hobbes gets cuddlier, the parents get taller, and Calvin.... well, he doesn't change much, except for subtle details, like mouth size and hair spikiness.<br /><br />Is this massive edition good reading? Depends on how strong your wrists out. The heavy covers and paper make this an impressive collector's item, but hard to hold up without spraining your back. However, it makes a great thing to rest on your lap, or the table.<br /><br />The paper and binding are excellent quality, compared to many collectors' items, and you can expect it to hold up to repeated readings if you want to do so. It also includes insights and early work from Watterson, his philosophies, why there weren't Hobbes plushies in every drug store, and so on.<br /><br />While this book will probably give you sprained wrists, it's worth buying for the excellent quality and the insights that Watterson provides. An enchanting series, and one that is still funny and fresh so many years later.ysitter.

0307276902|5.0|Hooked from the beginning, page one, I could not put this book down.  I identified with every thought, word, and feeling.  I was amazed by the courage of the writer, and his strength in sticking to his gut feelings in a recovery world that tells one that one's own best thinking landed them in the place that they  occupy!  That he did this with courage, dignity, fear,guilt, great love and sick will gave me a feeling of great hope for him, and all human beings at a particularly negative time in human history!  The depth and breadth of his honesty was a homecoming for me and many like me.
0316168815|5.0|Lovely Bones by Alice Seabold is truely a remarkable tale in its own way. We first meet the main character, Susie Salmon, in a place that she calls her heaven. She tells her story as a young girl who was raped and then murdered by a man she had met only few times before. She watches her family and friends as they cope with the loss and deal with the changes. I think this is hard for her to handle. She watches them suffer but she cannot do anything about it. Her dad, once the police said that they had to basically give up the case for the lack of any evidence, tries to hunt down the killer himself. This puts an even bigger seperation between his wife and him. Susies mom, Abigail, suffers very much as well. She has to deal with the loss of her daughter and of her husband mentally. This also causes some interesting events to occur in the story. Susies brother and sister handle this in the only way they know of. Her sister hardens her heart to the world in an effort to stay strong. Her brother doesnt really know what is going on and is not sure what they mean by the word dead.  <br />     This story to me represents hope as we watch a family deal with something that we all hope we never have to go through. This is a book that is filled with suspense, sadness, healing, imagination, and last but not least love. I personally hope that all who read it will feel the same way as this is a teriffic story!

0007137338|4.0|Garth Nix changed the face of dark fantasy (usually just horror with a prettier cover) with his instant hit \\"Sabriel.\\" It provided fans with a unique type of magic, a well-crafted alternate world, and talking animals that were anything but cute. Without missing a step, \\"Lirael\\" follows in \\"Sabriel\\"'s footsteps, with the same dark blend of humor and horror.<br /><br />Lirael is a daughter of the Clayr, but she won't be a full Clayr until she gains the Sight. On her fourteenth birthday, she is the oldest girl to not yet have gained the Sight. After contemplating suicide, Lirael is assigned to work in the library, and inadvertantly sets loose a hideous Free Magic creature: a Stilken that will call other Free Magic creatures and destroy the Clayr. Desperate to deal with her mistake, Lirael calls up the Disreputable Dog (somehow made both of Free and Charter Magic) and soon ends up finding out more about her past -- and her future.<br /><br />Elsewhere, Sabriel's son Sameth is pursued by the Dead, and is almost killed in the process; the only thing he gets for his trouble is a threat from a mysterious necromancer. Sam is supposed to be the future Abhorsen, but the problem is that he's petrified by the things his mother handles easily. And he's helped loose Free Magic on a world increasingly torn by a mysterious masked necromancer...<br /><br />Nix takes the rich world he created in \\"Sabriel\\" and makes it even richer. It's a bit like a melding of typical high fantasy with an early twentieth-century setting (phones, buses, cricket matches, electricity, guns). Old faves like Sabriel, Touchstone, and Mogget appear here (although Mogget's appearance is a bit brief), along with new and equally likable characters.<br /><br />Some readers may not like Lirael as well as they liked the more self-assured, kick-butt Sabriel, but Sabriel knew who she was, where she was coming from, and knew what she needed to know. Lirael is only learning those things, which makes her a more vulnerable, confused heroine. She becomes stronger and more self-assured as she learns more about Charter magery and her background.<br /><br />\\"Lirael\\" has the same balance of humor and horror as the first book. We have things like the bodies of refugees being turned into decayed Dead Hands, the clawed insecto-human Stilken, or just the aura of darkness around the Book of the Dead. But we also have funny things like Nick or the running joke about the Dog and food.<br /><br />The Disreputable Dog is a lot like Mogget, in that she's more than she seems and a handy source of info, but not as quietly menacing as Mogget was. And Sam is endearingly unsure of himself, and is one of the few fantasy characters to be genuinely terrified of his \\"duties,\\" not just apprehensive. His sister was the one character who fell flat; she seemed a little too \\"bossy princess.\\"<br /><br />The biggest problem with \\"Lirael: Daughter of the Clayr\\" is that it ends on a \\"to be continued\\" note. So be sure to have the concluding novel, \\"Abhorsen,\\" ready while you read this book. Dark, funny, creepy, and immensely well-written.a more vulnerable, confused heroine.

B000A7S4B0|5.0|This is a strong album that expands this group into a bit larger realm.  Not as radical as you might think.  Their concerts will have a nice acoustic interlude now.  This is good and shows their talent.<br /><br />There's a couple songs that are Dylanesque and more than a couple that sound like late Lennon Beatles influence.  All good.<br /><br />My favorite songs are Ain't No Easy Way, Shuffle Your Feet, and Devils waitin but none disappont.  It's all strong though.<br /><br />My complaint is with the software that installs when you plug the CD into your PC.  It blew up the first time and then tries to copy protect etc.  (It's one of the reasons I no longer buy anything Sony besides artists I can't do without, and then I hesitate)  If you have an Apple though it rips it perfect and you can then burn from there.  (Is there no limits to greed and irritation in this industry?)<br /><br />Not to mention the fact that you blow on these CD's anymore and they skip.  And they expect us not to make copies?

B000AARKOO|3.0|Hollywood movies have never had the reputation to be historically accurate, and this movie, portraying the events surrounding the retaking of Jerusalem by the armies of Saladin, is no different. If one reads in some detail the many historical works on the Crusades (specifically the English translations) one easily sees these inaccuracies. However, the movie does respect much of the historical record, depending of course on the historian(s) one wishes to consult. It is difficult to understand why Hollywood cannot make a movie that respects totally the true history, even given the pressures it feels to entertain the viewer.<br /><br />The movie's characters revolve around the following historical figures:<br /><br />Balian II of Ibelin: leader of Frankish resistance in Jerusalem in 1187. The real Balian was not a blacksmith and was married to Maria Comnena and was born in Jerusalem. According to some historians, Balian was an aggressive, even desperate, defender of Jerusalem, and the movie portrays him to be the same. His wife Maria (not portrayed in the movie) however alienated the Greek inhabitants of Jerusalem, who were already labeled as `heretics' by the Frankish Christians, and who were described by some historians as wishing for a Saladin victory.<br /><br />King Baldwin IV: the \\"Leper King\\", who ruled Jerusalem from 1174 to 1185. Some historians portray Baldwin IV as intelligent and as tenacious, and it is also an interesting fact that Baldwin IV was a leper from earliest childhood, but was still able to obtain the crown of Jerusalem. One can only speculate what would have happened if Baldwin IV had lived years longer than what he did. The jockeying for power after his death no doubt contributed a lot of instability and uncertainty in Jerusalem, making it easier for Saladin to retake it.<br /><br />Reynald of Chatillon: Prince of Antioch from 1153 - 1160 and lord of Kerak of Moab from 1177 - 1187. Reynald's behavior has been described by some historians as provoking Saladin into a conflict, and this behavior is reflected in the movie. Somewhat contrary to the content of the movie however, Baldwin IV entrusted Reynald with the command of the troops of Jerusalem, but they were defeated in the desert by the armies of Saladin.<br /><br />Saladin Yusuf: Sultan from 1174 - 1193. Saladin was leader of the Muslim army that finally took Jerusalem back from the Christians in the summer of 1187. His character has been given mixed reviews by the historians of the Crusades, being portrayed as a brutal and fanatical Muslim by some and as a conqueror that did not abuse his power by others.<br /><br />Saladin and Balian are both portrayed as somewhat calm, rational figures in the movie, contrary to what some historians say about them. Saladin did not let the inhabitants go as was portrayed in the movie. According to a few historians, this is inaccurate, as most were sold into slavery. Other historians though paint a different picture of Saladin, portraying him as being very kind and merciful, to be contrasted with the brutality of the Christian invaders of the First Crusade eighty-eight years earlier.  Under an agreement with Saladin, Balian tried to raise ransom money for thousands of the poor inhabitants of Jerusalem, but was unable to, primarily due to the stinginess of the churches of Jerusalem. Those inhabitants that were not ransomed were sold into slavery by the Muslims.  It is true however that Saladin refrained from slaughtering the Christian inhabitants of Jerusalem due to Balian's threat to destroy Jerusalem and murder its Muslim inhabitants. In addition, after retaking Jerusalem, Saladin refused to destroy the Church of the Holy Sepulcher, even though he was advised to do so by his lieutenants. The Knights Templar were not allowed access to the Mosque of al-Aqsa however, as Saladin restricted it to the Muslim faith.<br /><br />The real battles were a lot bloodier than even this movie portrayed them, even considering the hundreds of corpses lying in the desert being eaten by scavenging birds. The movie though was accurate in its portrayal of the condition of the armies of Jerusalem, with some historians describing it as being crowded with refugees and there being only two knights in the entire city.<br /><br />The success of Saladin's armies in retaking Jerusalem from the Christians provoked the Third Crusade. The movie ends with Richard the Lionhearted (Richard Coeur-de-Lion) and king of England, making his way to Jerusalem.<br /><br />It is fair to say that the director wants to play a conciliatory role between the Christian and Muslim faiths. One can be sympathetic with this goal, but a distortion of history never truly benefits anyone, despite the best of intentions. The invasion of Jerusalem by the Muslim armies of the eighth century were brutal and immoral acts, as were the invasions of the First Crusade and also the retaking of Jerusalem by Saladin's armies. The historical events must be seen and accepted as they are, and not used to justify a particular religious worldview or political ideology. Hollywood directors and screenwriters grant themselves the right to distort or falsify history in order to produce more satisfying entertainment. Historians have granted themselves the right to distort or falsify history for various reasons of their own. Which one of these groups is the most honorable?

B00005JMJ4|5.0|If you've ever been in a hotel in a strange city, lonely and unable to sleep, you will instantly identify with Bob Harris (Bill Murray), even though Harris is a well-heeled star and you probably are not. But don't go into this film expecting the plot to follow cliches. Harris is a prisoner in a 5-star palace, dealing with a difficult wife back home, and running into nubile, much younger Charlotte (Scarlett Johansson). You'd expect she and Harris and to have a sexual liaison. They do not, and the plot and script avoid a dozen other cliches.<br /><br />Instead, the story takes Harris and Charlotte down unexpected Tokyo alleys while the two try and sort out their lives.<br /><br />This film is directed with an eye to a stylistic capture of the reality of modern Japan. Bolstered by impressive cinematography (especially lighting and camera angles), it keeps the viewer interested and engaged as Murray and Johansson deliver consummate performances. Indeed, this is by far Bill Murray's finest work. Instead of the over-the-top characters in everything from \\"Scrooged\\" to \\"Ghostbusters,\\" we see an actor with depth of voice, emotion, and facial expression.<br /><br />Sophia Coppola knows her subject, having spent several years in Japan. Perhaps she could have been a bit tighter with the editing, but there is little else bad to be said about this film. Of course, this isn't a film for the action-movie, dramatic-effects crowd. But if you are the sort who enjoys \\"slice of life,\\" good dialogue, and a touching tale, well, order it now!

B000A7Q2DM|4.0|30 Seconds to Mars' latest release, A Beautiful Lie is everything I like about rock. Jared Leto has an awesome voice, the songs are melodic but still have an edge, and the lyrics are powerful as well. The reviewer before me is obviously trying to be the hipster whose opinion differs from everybody else or either we aren't listening to the same album. <br /> <br />The opener, Attack, packs a huge punch and it is no wonder why it was chosen as a single. It is an amazing song. After that there are several standouts like A Beautiful Lie, The Fantasy, The Kill, R-evolve and Battle of One. But honstly I cannot think of one song I skip, because overall every track is solid. Not every track is great, but still solid. Anyway I don't know what else I could say but give it a listen for yourself and buy it if you like it. Any rock fan should give this 1 try.
B000667GFK|2.0|Luis Miguel has a pleasant and distinctive voice, but it doesn't work in ranchera.  This music form needs the earthiness of Vicente Fernandez, the dark sex appeal of Alejandro Fernandez, or the romantic heroism of Pablo Montero, none of which are present in Miguel's voice.  His version of \\"Cruz de Olvido\\" suffers terribly in comparison to Pablo's; it has no emotion at all and I am surprised at the musical arrangement for it, which sounds so trivial by comparison to every other version I have ever heard.  Even Mariachi Vargas, who are normally brilliant, are not at their best here. <br /> <br />Sometimes good singers make bad career decisions.  If Luis Miguel wants to sing ranchera, he needs to work harder at it.
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Their finest in over a decade, or something like that. <br /> <br />Most fans hated Depeche Mode's last album, Exciter, with a passion. It wasn't dark. It wasn't melodramatic. It displayed Depeche Mode for what they really are: a group of comfortable, 40-something family men who make music on the side. Exciter was a mature, comfortable record with grown-up themes and a soft musical palette. I loved it. <br /> <br />Playing the Angel returns the band to a more lyrically and musically tumultuous place. It's their darkest album since at least Ultra, if not Music for the Masses. And it actually resembles a strange hybrid of those two albums more than anything else in their catalogue. The early press would have had us believe that this album was the second helping of Violator. While the band increasingly acknowledges that that album is their high-water mark, they also increasingly drop hints that they are not in the form to release an album that is end-to-end flawless again. That said, Playing the Angel is an excellent Depeche Mode album, and it's probably as good as they'll ever be without Alan Wilder. (They continue their streak of career-defining albums started 20 years ago with Black Celebration.)  <br /> <br />This album marks the return of dance to their catalogue. For at least ten years, the band has left it up to remixers to shape their tunes into beat-oriented club fare. Here, there's a churning rhythm almost everywhere you turn. They haven't sounded this young since 1987's dance-floor classic, Music for the Masses. This album seems to meld a \\"Behind the Wheel\\" pump with \\"Pimpf\\"'s cacophony. <br /> <br />The only thing missing here is weighty lyrics. Depeche Mode is best when they deliver songs that marry teen-angst to the adult world of emotions. Here, they seem somehow stuck in the melodrama. \\"Damaged People\\" is a good example. It's a beautiful track, but it forces the S&M parlor games of yore. On the other hand, it works for the album in much the way that \\"World Full of Nothing\\" did on Black Celebration. <br /> <br />The best songs here will hold up to DM's best. \\"John The Revelator,\\" \\"Suffer Well,\\" \\"Precious\\" and \\"Lillian\\" are textbook Depeche Mode. They swing and slide in and out of gospel, blues and dance, and they take their time through snaky key changes to do it. It should be said that Playing the Angel is also one of their most bizarre albums. The blistering electronics take time to get used to, but always fit the songs. I'm truly surprised at how the abrasive \\"Sinner in Me\\" and \\"Darkest Star\\" have grown on me.  <br /> <br />It might as well be 1988, folks. Depeche Mode hasn't sounded this bold and vibrant since about that time. True, there's no jaw-dropping, end-all, be-all single like \\"Enjoy the Silence,\\" \\"Personal Jesus,\\" or \\"Strangelove.\\" But what we've got is an album that plays like a throwback yet sounds fresh and vital. <br />It's not Violator (what could be?) but I'll take it. <br />

B00062J00S|5.0|This is one of my most favorite Christmas movies!! It centers in on the belief that we all have a purpose in this life, which is clearly evidenced when the main character, George Bailey, seriously considers killing himself on Christmas Eve. He doesn't die, because an up and coming angel, Clarence, saves him. George tells Clarence that he wishes he'd never been born. George's wish comes true and he sees what his life and the lives of those around him would be like had George never been born. The ending is very well done. It always makes me smile. I hope that you'll get as much enjoyment out of this movie as I did. It truly is a beautiful story about life, love, family, and what all those things mean when seen through grateful eyes. :)
B00005ASGG|4.0|<br />John Ford's magnificent portrait of the lawless old west, THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE (1962), stars James Stewart as lawyer Rance Stoddard, Vera Miles as his wife Hallie, John Wayne as rancher Tom Donophon, and Lee Marvin as Liberty Valance, the meanest and nastiest outlaw in the frontier town of Shinbone.  Originally dismissed as just another John Wayne western, LIBERTY VALANCE is now considered a masterpiece of the genre. <br /> <br />The plot is simple:  Stoddard and Donophon join forces to kill Valance and his men on the night streets of Shinbone outside of the saloon.  But when and how?  Rounding out the cast is Ford's superb repertory of character actors:  Andy Devine as a marshall, Edmond O'Brien as a news editor, Ken Murray as a drunken doctor, John Qualen as a cook, and Woody Strode as a kitchen helper whose being black is never mentioned.  Ford is very hard on fair treatment of women (though Vera Miles is outstanding here), but he at least treats African-Americans with respect. <br /> <br />LIBERTY VALANCE is set in a long ago frontier town, with flawless art direction that includes stagecoaches and horse-drawn carriages.  One can smell the whiskey in the saloon and the sawdust on the wood-planked sidewalks.  And the movie has gorgeous B&W photography by William Clothier, who photographed several other Ford movies.  Most of the characters are complex, neither good nor bad.  The exception, of course, is Lee Marvin.  He makes Liberty Valance so vividly cruel and nasty that I needed reassurance that the actor is really dead in actual life!  The character is that real!  Stewart and Wayne are both in peak form.  They both had a great year in 1962, with this and HOW THE WEST WAS WON. <br /> <br />THE MAN WHO SHOT LIBERTY VALANCE, a serious and thoughtful adult western, is on DVD in the cheap $11.00 range as part of a John Wayne Signature Collection from Paramount Home Video.  I recommend you build your Wayne DVD collection with these studio print titles, also including THE SHOOTIST, THE COWBOYS, EL DORADO, HONDO, and the wide-screen debut of McLINTOCK!  (REVIEWED ON WIDESCREEN DVD.) <br /> <br />   <br />
0786852550|5.0|This book was fantastic. The storyline was gripping and full of action, so well-written that even in the tamer parts the novel was unputdownable. The characters were great... Bartimaeus was rather full of himself, and very witty. Nathaniel could probably be compared to Artemis Fowl; he's not exactly the most likeable person, but he's very clever and you find yourself hoping everything works out all right for him in the end. The characters who are supposed to be evil, you find yourself loathing. The characters who are supposed to be good are not really all that good, but they are rather endearing. This is a great book, and although it's been said many times about many children's fantasy books, this is definitely MUCH better than Harry Potter!
B0007MWZEK|5.0|I have had my Swivel Sweeper for 5 months and LOVE it!  It is great on both carpet & smooth floors.  People need to use the little cutter tool to cut threads that get wrapped around the brushes & empty the dirt tray.   <br />In fact, I am purchasing 3 more for my children as Christmas presents. <br />Great for pet hair...I have 2 little dogs and my sweeper picks up their hair off the carpet & vinyl floor. <br />I do think the shipping is a bit pricey since the sweeper is so light but I have NO regrets!!!
B00000JY1X|5.0|This album is just as the review title says: Brilliant.  It doesn't go overboard at any point, sticking to it's simple and raw style, which could be kind of hard to do considering it's depth.<br /><br />The best way I can describe it: The darkly humorous lyrics are similar to The Smiths and Morrissey, the vocals reminiscent of Joy Division and Pulp, and the music sounds like it was a big influence for The Arcade Fire.<br /><br />But it's better to just hear and experience for yourself so you can make your own interpretations.  ...Amazing.
B0000025F7|5.0|Michael Jackson was already a pop and R&B sensation due to his beginnings with the Jackson Five but nobody really new what he was capable of doing untill this album came out in 1979.  Instantly, Jackson helped usher in the wide spread acceptance of pop music as a serious and cultural force.  It also represents the end of an era.  Dance and Disco were quickly fading away at the end of the 1970's  but this record gave them one last breath of life before their demise in the early 80's.   <br /> <br />     Jackson doesn't go wrong once on this album.  Opening with, \\"Don't Stop Till You Get Enough\\", (One of the most relentless and catchy dance tunes ever), not once does the album let up.  \\"Rock With You\\",  the second track,  is a much more mellow, smooth, almost ballad, like number.  \\"Work'in Day And Night\\", is the most underrated pop song ever...period!!. It has not appeared on any greatest hits compilation, (not even the recent box set).  Yet it is one of the high points of the whole album.  Sort of like Jackson's version of, \\"Hard Day's Night\\", the track is extremely catchy and one of his most memorable.  The title track, \\"Off The Wall\\", sums up the whole album.  Life is better and more exciting when you live it, \\"off the wall\\".  The album takes a whole new turn completely with the track, \\"She's Out Of My Life\\",; one of Jackson's most beautiful, powerful and most personal ballads he's ever performed.  The album ends with a sorta farewell to the disco era.  The track, \\"Burn This Disco Out\\", is the perfect album closer with its funky dance grooves and its climatic presence. <br /> <br />    This album along with Prince's, \\"Dirty Mind\\", and The Clash's, \\"London Calling\\", paved the way for new and exciting things to come.  I have never heard an album that sounded so fresh and fun to listen to.  You cannot go wrong with this album.  If you are a fan of any kind of pop music, get this as soon as possible.  You will not be disappointed
B0000AQS0F|5.0|Out of all the TV series ever created I would say Firefly rates up there with MacGyver, Star Trek TNG, and Stargate SG1. I'm a big fan of Sci-Fi, but I also prefer that what I choose for my entertainment convey a good interesting or thought provoking story. Firefly fit the bill almost perfectly.  Without taking itself to seriously (which Star Trek almost did) Firefly still came across with cool and interesting messages. <br /> <br />This was a very cool show. Too bad Fox didn't give it a good air time and then killed it before they realized people enjoyed it so much. <br /> <br />Friends that have seen this have all gotten hooked (so to speak). Even a few that didn't care much for Sci-Fi in general. This is a good show.
B00000DFSK|3.0|U2 is easily one of the greatest rock bands of the 80's.  They made so many great albums and songs that it would be very difficult to assemble an accurate compilation of their best material.  Unfortunately that is exactly what this record has failed to do. <br /> <br />     Sure you get a sample of much of their best work.  However the record is poorly assembled.  At least two of the tracks are edited down: \\"Where The Streets Have No Mame\\" and \\"New Year's Day\\".  I have no idea why.  The album is only an hour long and there is more than enough space to fill it up.  The selection is poor.  For example: no songs from their album, \\"October\\", are on here.  The Album, \\"War\\", is missing many great songs such as, \\"Seconds\\", \\"Two Hearts Beat As One\\" and \\"40\\".  Even, \\"Joshua Tree\\", misses out.  Where is, \\"Running Two Stand Still\\" and \\"Bullet The Blue Sky\\"?  Some songs made the list that don't belong at all.  \\"When Love Comes To Town\\", is a disappointing take on blues song which was only a hit becase of the appearance of B.B.King.  \\"Bad\\" is long, boring and drags on for five or six minutes.   <br /> <br />     One good thing is that the album closes with perhaps their most beautiful love ballad ever, \\"All I Want Is You\\", which was the only reason to own the album, \\"Rattle And Hum\\".  If your interested in U2's music for the first time ever, this might be an OK place to start.  Otherwise buy the original LPs.  As for the song, \\"All I Want Is you\\", download it off of Kazaa or something.  You'll be happy you did.
B000ASSDVA|1.0|The quality of the picture was acceptable considering the age of the original movie.  The sound, however, was hard to control.  The music always drowned the dialogue so I had to turn the volume up to hear the words.  Then I had to turn the volume down when the music was on without dialogue.  The storyline and acting is great.  Charlton Heston and Sofia Loren at their best. <br />
0471267554|4.0|I think this is a good book on diet and nutrition and culture. The author is correct, I think, to criticize the typical U.S. diet, which is literally killing millions of people, because it is heavily based on sugar, carbohydrates, fat, and sodium (salt). Processed foods are full of bad things like hydrogenated fats, and fast food has all kinds of bad things in it. I also think that the idea of eating lean protein, fruits and vegetables is a very good idea. For example, you can literally eat as much fruit as you want. By the time your stomache is full, you will stop eating, but the energy density to volume of food is very low, so you won't gain weight. I think one big factor in the U.S. obesity epidemic is lack of exercise and movement (driving everywhere) and also the fact that portions keep increasing in size. Going to a lean protein and fruit and veggies diet is a good idea, because protein make you feel full far longer than carbs do. So in essence, I like this book and will do this diet. However, I mean, let's get real, the average paleolithic man or woman lived probably to be about 22 on average, whereas we today live to be 74. Paleo man died probably mostly of infections and parasites. He did not live long enough to develop heart disease or the types of diseases the author associates with our \\"high carb diet\\". So it is a bit of an unfair comparison. I would take our modern lifestyle over that of paleo man any day of the week, and I think it is a bit odd to hold up as a model a people that died so young. Another issue I have is, if our genetic code designs us for eating lean protein and veggies, why do the things we crave tend to be other things (donuts, pizza, etc.). If my genes are specifically built for eating veggies and lean protein, why do I like pizza and donuts more ? It can't all be \\"cultural factors\\". I once read an interview of a top European nutrition expert, and he said, they did research on what is in uncooked vegetables, and he reported that manyof the things are very harmful. Brocholi has some really nasty substances in it ! He also said that we should tune more into what our body tells us, because it doesn't lie. For example, you body self-regulates, and will give you signals for what to eat and when, if you know how to listen to it. So the idea in the Paleo diet that uncooked veggies are all good and that we are genetically designed to eat them and lean protein makes me wonder a bit, because moms all over the world have to force their kids to eat stuff like brocholi. Maybe nature knows a lot more than we do, and those kids are right, if they listen to what their body is telling them. I think the truth is, our paleo genetics doesn't know we live in an environment of extremely easy access to food (especially in the U.S.), and we tend to love fats and sugars and salt because in a resource-scare environment, we HAD to love them, because they were so rare. On the other hand, veggies were everywhere. So I think there are some very good concepts in this book, and everyone should think this through. It is fascinating and I appreciate that the author wrote this book, because it puts us on the right track.

B00030590I|2.0|This movie is basically communist propaganda. It is about how the center of the country dominates the provinces and the value of having a strong central leader. In other words, it is a paid ad for single-party dictatorship in China. Artistically, it is good, but from the point of politics, it left a bad taste in my mouth. Also, the director seems addicted to showing different colors (entire rooms of yellow, entire rooms of blue, etc). It got boring after awhile.

B000002KKS|5.0|With the majestic title track, \\"Neon Knights\\", \\"Children of the Sea\\", \\"Die Young\\" and \\"Lonely Is the Word\\", Black Sabbath came back from the dead and opened the 1980's with quite possibly their greatest record, easily their best since 'Sabotage'. 'Heaven and Hell' was a career renaissance and for a short period of a couple of years, Sabbath were a major force again in the genre they created. The disintergration of the orignal lineup in early 1979 caused Sabbath to rethink their direction after Iommi had started to work with one Ronald Padonova aka Ronnie James Dio, who had recently left Ritchie Blackmore's Rainbow. Butler and Ward soon returned to the fold and a \\"new\\" Sabbath was born, streamlined for the NWOBHM generation. Faster more upbeat songs with Iommi's trademark menace and a new twist, Butler as longtime lyricist was out, Dio created or recreated the demons and wizards Sabbath. Dio is without a doubt Black Sabbath's greatest singer, operatic range, dynamics, flawless. Notice I said singer, not frontman because Ozzy will always be Sabbath's and one of rock's greatest showman. But Oz never had the chops and Dio kicks the band in the ass with his forceful direction. \\"Neon Knights\\" is an alltime barnburner, fantastic imagery and powerful metal, protectors of the realm indeed! \\"Heaven and Hell\\" has one of the greatest opening lines in the history of rock. If you are new to Sabbath and don't have this record then what are you waiting for?This monument to metal has rarely been surpassed. The followup nearly pulls it off and is a special record in its own right. For two years Black Sabbath successfully challenged their former frontman for metal supremacy but it was not to last...
B000B2YQX4|4.0|Actually 3 1/2, I don't agree with 5 and 1 star reviews, this album is good, is not perfect, there isn't perfect albums in Depeche Mode discography, maybe music for the masses, violator and black celebration are the most consistent, but still have fillers, that's DM, a band with great talent, who made great great songs through the years, but not very prolific in just one shot.    People who complain about this album and call themselves a DM fans, should have know this. The pros are they still can write good songs, respecting their music idiology after all these years, that's something not easy to do and there aren't much bands out there who achived that.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie and I enjoy watching the special features, but I was disappointed to find that there is no commentary even for a \\"deluxe\\" edition.   <br /> <br />Furthermore, the second disc is laid out like pages from a comic book where you move the cursor to highlight menu keys to access the features.  For instance, you would highlight certain words in the dialogue bubbles or highlight objects in the background.  However, the cursor or highlighter disappeared but I could still blindly access the features.  It was very annoying.  If I ejected the disc and started over, the highlighter would come back and would stay if I did not access any of the features in the comic pages (another set of features are simply listed after the comic page format).  Again, very annoying.  If anyone else has experienced this problem let me know. <br /> <br />One more thing--and this isn't a complaint--for anyone who did not know this already, Christain Bale purposely kept the American accent in some interviews (so that US audiences would not wonder why Batman seems British), but you will find some features where he lets his Welsh accent be known.  This can be confusing if you don't know the reason behind it.  See also the Quotes & Trivia page.
B0000AQS0F|5.0|I'll have to admit to not noticing this when it was broadcast on Fox.... I thought it looked pretty intriguing, but its Friday night timeslot precluded my watching it for one reason or another.  When I did finally get around to watching it, it had been pre-empted/moved/otherwise displaced.  Thanks to DVD I finally discovered its wonders.  \\"Western with spaceships\\" initially may sound silly, but it's an apt description, a jumping-off point to the somewhat anti-Star Trek universe, or \\"the 'Verse,\\" as the Firefly characters refer to it.  I'm only regretful that half a season and the movie Serenity is all we've got.  I'm hopeful that more Serenity movies come our way, and hoping against hope for a renewed, revitalized Firefly series.  If neither of those do happen, I'll have to content myself with this.
B0009WFFS6|3.0|Well, Cream were essentially a jam band, never having made their impact with songwriting or albums (although everyone should pick up WHEELS OF FIRE), and this point is in great evidence throughout. I still love the Band the most (yes, that's the group that forced Clapton to break up Cream in the first place) and I wish they would have been more faithful to the old Cream days, but still it's great just to see them playing again. Jack does look sickly, but I think he's just exhausted. Yet how can that be? They slow \\"Crossroads\\" down to a jazz beat (I was hoping to see the lightning solo that Eric played on the version we all know and love) and Eric does most of the singing on \\"White Room\\". But oh well, one could have some reservations, but this is the new Cream. In that light, it's an essential concert, and I hope they get back into the studio soon and wow us with a new (hopefully good) record.

0670033375|1.0|I was sent this by a friend. so I began it with interest.  But as I read through its theories and history I kept coming back to the conclusion that when you think carefully about the basic propositions of the book - namely that geography or human carelessness or other events can help a society fail - it left me flat.<br /><br />Admittedly, I do not know the history of all of the areas that he writes about but those areas that I knew well - namely the ancient Mexican and Central American civilizations - Diamond makes some assumptions that are either great jumps of faith or simply mistaken based on current scholarship in the area.  That leads me to question the rest of his history - where I am not as well read.<br /><br />All of the factors he lists are potentially catastrophic to societies but I would have preferred a bit less global theory building in exchange for a little more careful thought.  The influences which have helped to destroy civilizations should be of interest to all of us.  A raft of other historians have tried to create grand theory in this area.  But a lot of what Diamond writes about here seems mostly to be derivative.
B000002JK2|5.0|I am waiting for a remastered version of this then classic because the combination of the styles at play here and all the great guests made this album one of the better staples of then popular FM rock...<br /><br />Rock,folk,country,vaudeville,(not much blues or jazz)songs makes this one great lively affair.All the songs are good and it deserves mention as a really good album that deserves 5 stars for it's music,mix of characters and listenability even in 2005.

I'm really fascinated with all things Celtic, so I have many CD's.  But, this one is one of my favorites!
B00000637V|5.0|Backed by great artists and studio men such as Stevie Winwood,Jack Bruce,Aynsley Dunbar(Bowie's drummer)Randy Brecker this epic concept album not only set the tone for what became mope/melancholy rock but also ranks as possibly Lou's finest album at least his definitive trademark as the man whose life reflects his art.<br />Forget the themes of suicide, abuse, child abandonment,drug abuse,overall decadence.. this album rocks hard and it's lush production by \\"madman\\" Bob Ezrin of Alice Cooper fame who brings this quality of controlled hysteria to the album.It was made for Ezrin to produce.<br />Rocking where it needs to, melancholy balladry,horns in the right places,a total masterpiece not be missed and a CD hard to describe.
B0007GAEGC|5.0|I think I originally bought this because of the cover girl's gorgeous curly red hair -- no not really!  BUT the cover did catch my eye and then I listened to the snippets that Amazon offered to those who have a sound card.  I bought it and have not been disappointed with it.  The varied artists have the voices of angels! I listen to it often and confess to track 10 -  'SOMEDAY' probably being my favorite song, but they are all  beautifully done - even if I don't understand the language on some.  Gorgeous music - soothing and at times invigorating! --  I can't imagine anyone not enjoying this beautifully done set of perfectly performed Celtic music!
B00000I41G|5.0|Midnight Blue is to jazz guitar as Kinda Blue is to jazz in general.  In my opinion, this is the best jazz guitar cd of all time. And it isn't Wes Montgomery, it's Kenny Burrell.
B000AP04EW|5.0|I thought the movie was wild and funny. Jolie stole the show. The cast was great and the effects were great. The best movie Iv seen this year. It is a little like War of the Roses. I loved the movie and think that it is a must see for the summer. It was better than I thought it was going to be. It is worth the price of admission. It is a little violent at times for a PG-13 but It is still a great movie to see. It is more than just a action movie and more than a comedy. It is a movie than can be turned into a major franchise if done right and it has been done right. Angelina Jolie takes over every scene she is in and Brad Pitt is good in his part.  I found it a very fun summer movie
B000AARKOO|5.0|Take a first rate drama.  Add quality actors and special effects.  Place in a historically accurate setting (especially a setting largely overlooked by modern culture).  Mix in just a dab of Christian, Islamic, and Jewish conflict.  Wrap the whole mixture in a 2 disc package crammed full of educational features, and what do you get?  A 5-star presentation that will be a welcome to many dvd collections!<br /><br />I've waited a long time for this dvd to be released and am not disappointed.
B000BSZ0SI|5.0|I bought this CD about 15 years ago when it was readily available in the US, and find it both bloodcurtling and disturbing.  Richard Strauss bordered on atonality in parts of \\"Elektra\\" and the disturbing shrieks from the orchestra and singers underline the elements of madness in Elektra's character part.  Inge Borke, whom I confess to know little about, was a good choice on conductor Karl Bohm's part for the title role of this opera.  She seems mad almost throughout the opera with moments of calm and sanity in the inner parts of the score. <br /> <br />For those of you who aren't familiar with this music, read the title again.  It is disturbing!  It is not the comfortable sounds of Mozart, as in \\"The Marriage of Figaro\\" or Rossini's \\"The Barber of Seville.\\"  This is 20th century music, and compositionally conservative Richard Strauss's most bold, daring, disturbing and dissonant piece, worlds away from \\"Der Rosenkavalier.\\" <br /> <br />The Dresden State Orchestra is of course terrific under Bohm's baton, and although there are some out of tune woodwind parts in the middle pages of the score, the intensity and flow is so great, who cares?  Karl Bohm (1894-1981) was authoritative in Richard Strauss's operas and orchestral works, having been a personal friend of the composer from the early 1930s until Strauss's death in 1949. <br /> <br />The opera lasts about 100 minutes, so is not as long as some of the more famous operas in the repertory.  \\"Elektra\\" is set in ancient Greece, and the whole atmosphere is gloomy, unsettled, and depressing.  Don't listen to this if you're down, having a bad day, or need a lift.  It's the aural parallel of a Goya painting: bold and shocking.  <br /> <br />Karl Bohm recorded a film version of Elektra in 1981: it was his last project, and he died before it's release.  This will be released on DG DVD on November, and I look forward to seeing/hearing it.  The DVD has Leonie Rysanek and Dietrich Fischer-Dieskau (he's also in this recording) among the cast. Seeing \\"Elektra\\" as well as hearing it will be equally disturbing as this recording.
0441012906|3.0|I was reading through a list of \\"who's reading what\\", and I saw that the head of Amazon was reading Century Rain by Alastair Reynolds.  It sounded like a decent sci-fi title, so I gave it a try.  After taking a couple weeks to finish it, my general impression is \\"eh\\"...<br /><br />Set in the future, earth is now uninhabitable because of some nanotech infestation that killed everyone off except for some people who had already started to develop settlements in space.  Verity Auger is an archeologist who specializes in bringing back remains from the planet, and now the authorities need her help in figuring out a mystery...  as in what happened to one of their agents who traveled back in time via a wormhole in space, and ended up murdered.  The problem is that her few belongings seem to point to some catastrophe in the making, and no one knows what she was on to before she got killed.  Auger reluctantly goes on the mission, and meets up with a person from the past who is also trying to solve the mystery.  He doesn't know he's living in a \\"backup\\" of earth, and she doesn't want to tell him.  That all comes to an end when the Slashers infiltrate the past in order to get the murdered agents clues, and Auger and her friend need to escape via a collapsing wormhole in time to prevent *his* world from meeting the same fate as the present-day earth.<br /><br />The premise held some promise, and I started into the book expecting to get absorbed rather quickly.  But way too much time was spent in the past world, bringing the detective up to the point where Auger gets injected into the story.  Getting Auger's story up to the intersection point was better, but both sides tended to drag a bit.  It wasn't until the last 200 or so pages (out of 500+) that I really wanted to keep reading to find out how it all ended.  And even after it was all done, I was sort of left wondering if the time I spent had been worth it.<br /><br />Perhaps others will like it, as it's not a *bad* novel.  It just didn't grab hold and captivate me like I was hoping for...l.  It just didn't grab hold and captivate me like I was hoping for...
B000BB1MIC|5.0|As with many other reviewers - I do not agree with John Q. Public.  I do not watch any TV, but when introduced to the first series of GG on dvd found I was hooked.  I have watched series 1 through 4 now.  The acting is excellent, the ideas are quirky (Kirk just keeps on getting better), the literary, political and film references are what take this above the usual expectations of a tv show.  The only problem is that The Gilmore Girls is too addictive!
B0001ZX0OW|5.0|\\"Mystic River\\" definitely falls in the category of \\"character-driven\\" film.  It succeeds brilliantly, and is a benchmark for movies where character and not plot take center stage.<br /><br />First, you must have a plot, even if it's not the centerpiece of the movie.  Too many \\"character-based\\" dramas are meandering messes that go nowhere.  In contrast, \\"Mystic River\\" has enough of a plot to keep things moving, and it's interesting.<br /><br />Second, you must have a good script.  Oftentimes \\"character-driven\\" movies are tedious at best, because the characters have nothing to say.  Here, the screenwriter really created some memorable characters and great dialogue.  I am sure that Robbins, Bacon and Penn had a lot to do with that, too.<br /><br />That leads into point three - you must have great actors to breathe life into your characters, when your characters are your movie.  Robbins, Bacon and Penn have never been better, and each do a fantastic job.  Their performances are engrossing, and keep the film from dragging.<br /><br />Highly recommended.
B000000H57|4.0|I first heard Type O Negative thanks to a friend that gave me this album as a gift almost ten years ago. In 2005, I found myself digging back for it. The truth is I can't speak for any of their other albums, but with \\"October Rust\\" they pulled off a sound that I keep enjoying a decade later. Here I hear some Peter Murphy (the voice from Bauhaus), but also a definitive goth metal sound due to its overall dark feel.<br /><br />While not an album for every day, and with a couple of songs that I skip when they start playing, \\"October Rust\\" is still packed with timeless pieces, from \\"Love you to Death\\" and \\"Red Water\\" to \\"Wolf Moon\\" (the high point of the album) that you will find enjoying even after a long time has passed.
B000BRBA8S|4.0|This was a beautifully shot movie. Every scene seemed to float into the next, the film reminded me of a dream where events seem to ping back and forth from one moment to the next.  <br /> <br />If you have a short attention span and require action this is certainly not the movie for you. Also if you require a rock solid plot where everything comes together neatly and nicely in the end you might want to pass. This is more for the retrospective, introverted film lover, a movie about memories and regret, tough decisions and the murkiness of emotions. The acting was professional and very focused, and the dialogue was such a nice surprise, very natural and coy... like a teasing lover. <br /> <br />The only reason I do not give this film 5 stars is that I feel the ending could have been trimmed a bit, since this is a slow moving film. I will have to re-watch on DVD to see if I still feel this way after seeing it in the comfort of my home instead a indie movie house (where the seating is less than desired, but god bless them).
B0002ZYE1Y|5.0|Nighwish is a band I'd been searching for for a long time. It's a perfect blending of heavy metal and beautiful orchestral arrangments, until now done with synth. With 'Once', we witness the aclamation of this potential by the addition of a full symphony to nearly every one of their songs. Tuomas Holopainen's compositions and (along with Pip Williams) orchestral arrangments are creatively on par with any modern composer today. There's not much I can add to the other reviews on the individual songs, the spotlight reviews are dead on. Tarja Tununen's vocals have agreeably gotten progressively less operatic and more lyrical, expanding to new styles (most notabe in the wonderfuly eerie 'The Siren') though for me, they are still the weakest point of the band. She has an undeniably beautiful voice and it works well with the style, I just don't especially like the wide vibrato and slightly slurred intervals. Imagine if you would, just for moment, Amy Lee from Evanescense singing these songs. I may be wrong, but I think it would be gorgeous, especially if she could adjust to fit the themeatic style. In any case, 'Once' is a production of epic musical proportion.
B000002JPA|5.0|Dream Theater are the most musically talented band of our time.  This is my favorite CD by Dream Theater mainly because of Metropolis Part 1 (Although Learning to Live and Surrounded are beyond incredable).  The lyrics are okay, but they have written better (Glass Prison, Metropolis Part 2:Scenes From a Memory) yet the guitar and keyboard solos are phemomenal.  I was not very excited about the new vocalist, because I liked the one from \\"When Dream and Day Unite\\" very much, but he kind of grew one me and now I like him more than the old one, although I must confess that I wish the singer from Symphony X joined with DT.  That would without a doubt be the best band ever.  And now that I am drifting off topic from the CD itself, I might as well just conclude with saying buy this album or else you will be truly missing out
B00001U0E1|5.0|Co-written by Tom Stoppard, this film is a fantastic and enjoyable (fictional) tale of Shakespeare's quest to become a prominent playwright while trying to figure out and understand - what is love? <br />The more you know Shakespeare (especially Romeo and Juliet) the more enjoyment you'll pull from this fun tale.
B00007G1ZC|5.0|This film transported me to an altogether different place - mystical & yet so real. It's a vignettte on what I call eight awakenings, eight stories interwoven so beautifully. The first one 'Sunshine through rain' is eclectic in it's imagnation & the last one 'Village of watermills' would be my ideal destination, & while I watched it, I was quite motionless. <br />               This Kurosawa film is one of my most treasured ones.
0060512806|4.0|It would be hard for somebody who hasn't read this book to gain a decent understanding of it just by reading the reviews and summaries found here.  If you want to understand what this book is about, read it.  The scope of it is far too wide for anyone to generalize it.  That being said, I'll give it my best shot. <br /> <br />Cryptonomicon is long and arduous. It's more of an epic than anything I've ever read, including the epic poem \\"The Odyssey.\\"  It takes more than a modicum of effort to finish AND understand it.  I still don't believe I got everything out of it that Stephenson intended but I'm happy with the end result.  If you're not a mathematician or computer whiz, there are substantial parts of the book that will at the least bore you, and at the most make you feel stupid.  Stephenson delves into such areas like number theory, the Riemann Hypothesis, cryptography and Information Security for 20-30 pages at certain points.  One can certainly understand the book without being knowledgable in these areas, but those that have studied them will be rewarded with some insightful discussion.  The story itself is very unique and entertaining.  There are, of course, some parts that are more interesting and exciting than others but each one contributes to the overall effect of the book.  What the plot boils down to is this: Randy Waterhouse is a computer geek living in the present.  He is part owner of a company called Epiphyte Corp.  Randy's grandfather, Lawrence Pritchard Waterhouse, was a code-breaker for the Allies during WWII, working mainly on codes emanating from the Eastern part of the world.  Bobby Shaftoe is part of a classified Army unit whose sole purpose is to hunt down Nazi U-boats and ships and sink them.  Amy Shaftoe is the grand-daughter of Bobby Shaftoe and owner of a marine excavation company in the Phillipines.  She joins forces with Randy Waterhouse to build a free \\"data haven\\" in the Phillipines that would revolutionize the way we use computers.Goto Dengo is a Japanese soldier with a skill for digging big holes.  Enoch Root is an enigmatic priest with an obscure past and a unique relationship to every other character in the book. Eventually all of these peoples' stories merge in the Phillipines because of some Nazi gold that may or may not be there and the reader discovers why Stephenson went to such great lengths earlier in the book to describe certain details. <br /> <br />The only thing about this book that I have a problem with is the ending.  It's not bad but I felt that the author could have rewarded the reader with a little more after the reader endured 1100+ pages to get to that point.  It doesn't leave anything unanswered but it does leave a little to be desired.  However, those may just be my feelings of despair after actually finishing the book.
B00005JOI3|2.0|Obviously, this film is designed to provoke post-film conversation with its \\"twist\\" of an ending.  The movie is well-shot, but compelling imagery does not make a great feature film.  For those who are interested, the plot was lifted directly from the much creepier, much less artier, and much more emotionally compelling, and much more realized 'Jacob's Ladder'.
0226039331|5.0|I actually use the BDAG 3rd Edition add on in BibleWorks 7.0 along with Kittel's TDNT and Spicq's Theological Lexicon book sets.  In my software I have BDAG next to Thayer's, Liddell & Scott, Louw & Nida's Semantical Domain, United Bible Societies, and Friberg's Lexicon.  I use all of them every week for sermon exegesis (except for Kittel's and Spicq's).  BDAG is a great lexicon, maybe not the best...as some reviewers have said.  It really depends on what you are studying.  Louw & Nida's Semantical domain really helps one see the range of a word in context to other words, and BDAG doesn't do that.  BDAG gives one a lot of information, but if you are not a trained scholar, it's hard to understand it all.  So often I end up turning to other lexicons for more information.<br /><br />There is a tendency with BDAG towards gender inclusivity in some entries, so if you are concerned about that issue, you may be happy or unhappy with that depending on your position.  It's more accurate than the older editions.  Just know that the gender inclusive approach is controversial  and a reason why this lexicon should be compared with others. I really like to compare this lexicon with the semantical domain lexicon by Louw & Nida.<br /><br />Comparing this lexicon with other lexicons is super easy in the outstanding professional grade exegetical software called BibleWorks 6.0. (See my review there).  With the pass of mouse, one can see all the lexicons on a word, with BDAG being just one of several.  This allows constant comparison...and that's really the best way to use this lexicon in my opinion.  When you do that over and over, week after week, month after month as I do, one gets the feel for this lexicon's strength.  That strength is in providing good categories for a word, citing prime examples of each category, and a relatively fair approach in controversial issues.<br /><br />A nice improvement has been hyperlinks that allow one to click on BDAG citations to see their fuller context in the program.  I don't think I would get the book copy of this lexicon because the software version allows you to quickly paste an entry next to other lexicons in a word document and print them out for further ease of study and note taking.  How easy is that with a printed copy of the lexicon?<br /><br />With a program like BibleWorks 7.0 or their competitors one can search the lemma of a word instantly to see other instances of the use/form/stem which BDAG may not mention and get a graphical analysis of useage throughout various LXX/NT writers so you can assess the word in a more general way.<br /><br />Overall, BDAG turns out to be very helpful in providing a base to chase down more information on the nuance of a word's meaning for certain situations/contexts.  I cannot imagine doing exegesis without it.  I would only recommend you stick the $140 bucks into software that has BDAG as an add-on.  It's worth the extra money.<br /><br />2009 update to this review: I've found some bias in this lexicon. I've learned that one must double check the work, and have come to see more of this lexicon as a 'commentary' than as unbiased lexical data. For example, the word 'PROGINOSKO' (to foreknow) is defined in Thayer's lexicon simply as to foreknow, yet in BDAG it has two definitions: To foreknow AND also to choose beforehand. This second definition is then leaned on heavily by Calvinists to argue for Unconditional Eternal Election based in part on the two appearances of 'Proginosko' in Romans (8:29 is the classic example). The problem with this second definition is that the term 'Proginosko' is NEVER used to mean 'Choose beforehand' in any extra-biblical literature, Greek or Jewish anywhere. It always clearly means 'to know before' or 'foreknow' usually in a prophetic sense. And if one is willing to entertain theological views outside of Calvinism, then the definition 'Foreknow' fits beautifully in Romans 8:29. (BTW-Arminians differ on whether this matters for theirposition-I think it strengthens their position, but many don't think it's a necessary point). In any case, Lexicons should give definitions based on some convincing evidence...especially BDAG (which cites ancient sources outside the NT in it's very title!)  So this example, and there are others, demonstrates why I have learned to double check ALL lexicons and their claims.  Especially when any sort of debate is involved. Double check their claims by looking at the use of the term for yourself. This is very simple with one of the professional grade software programs out there. BibleWorks 8.0 is my current favorite, but there are others that can call up all uses of any term in a wide array of ancient literature (especially Jewish literature from 300 BC through 200 AD.<br /><br />Inspite of this big warning, summed up by a quote from Dr. Greg Beale at Wheaton College Grad School, \\"All Lexicons are commentaries\\", and inspite of the bias I find in this Lexical commentary, it is still a valuable tool and worthy of a five star. I still use it all the time, just double check the notes to make sure there is no bias.position-I think it strengthens their position, but many don't think it's a necessary point).

0688170528|5.0|On of my all time favorites. Jodi has done a fabulous job!!! A must read.
B000AU9UYM|4.0|This movie was a pleasant surprise for my family (most of us anyhow).  One of my teens thought it was stupid.  The rest of us loved it.<br /><br />As a kid I grew up watching Batman on TV.  This show gave me an origin to the entire concept of the show from the beginning by carefully and compellingly laying a foundation for how and why Batman uses the image he does and how he overcomes evil.  It is a movie we will end up buying, not just renting, because we'll want to see it from time to time.<br /><br />If you are a firstborn, and carry the 'hero' mantle in your family, you will no doubt love this movie.  It appeals to your internal sense of justice in a refined way that rejects some of the eastern tendencies that bother some of us.  At the same time I flaw the plot for providing no realistic solution for the inability of men to overcome their internal battle against evil desires.  The idea that sheer will power will do it seems rather pale to me.  So it's a four star....but the rest of the movie is really good.<br /><br />Kids can watch it and enjoy it because the bad language and sexual connotations that many movies contain were absent by and large.  Even the recently released 'Robots' contained a lot of references to gender confusion...yet this movie was refreshingly free from those common 'flies in the ointment' (if you will).<br /><br />Honestly the other Batman stuff I've seen in the last few years never made me happy.  As an old 60's Batman and Robin guy this was the first movie on Batman that I've seen that I thought was worth watching. It left me satisfied with the question of why is Batman Batman...and how did he really get started and why? That's the name of the movie...so I guess it delivered...Batman Begins.  See it if you haven't.  I think you'll agree...at least most of you will.
1400032717|2.0|After reading all the reviews I thought this would be a great book. I am half way through and can't go on. I developed a dislike for Christopher's father and he way he treats Christopher. The book seems to drag.
B0000028M7|5.0|Dirt (1992.), Alice In Chains' second studio album<br /><br />When most casual fans of early 90's alternative rock are asked who they reckoned were the most important of the Seattle grunge bands, they often say Pearl Jam, Nirvana or Soundgarden. However, this far from the case. Alice In Chains were another band who were herded under the Seattle grunge umbrella. Quintessentially a heavy metal outfit, the bands sombre and depressing lyrical and melodic outset saw to them as being part of the movement. 'Dirt' was Alice In Chains' follow up to their debut release 'Facelift' but was more importantly released at a time when grunge rock had gone pretty much mainstream. 'Dirt' has gone on to become a massive selling album for the band and is also hailed by many fans as AIC's definitive album; so is this a true reflection?<br /><br />To me, this album is more than just the definitive and greatest album by Alice In Chains; to me it is the greatest album of early 90's alternative rock. Albums such as 'Ten' or 'Superunknown' are awesome, barely flawed works, but this effort by AIC is, to me, even greater. Alice In Chains capture the spirit of grunge more than any band. The downbeat metal riffs played by Jimmy Cantrell coupled with the tortured, powerful and often depressing lyrics sung by Layne Staley is proof of this. The 'grunge' themes of drug addiction, pessimism, suicide and being down and out are everywhere in this album and seems all too real on this album more than any other grunge classic. For me, it often seems weird that I listen to this album so much, given its downbeat, depressing and difficult nature but strangely you feel drawn to and compelled to listen to this album; its that powerful. I personally wouldn't ever hesitate to put the work in my top five albums of all time without a shadow of doubt.<br /><br />AIC though, as I've said though were also your classic metal band. Throughout the album there are thunderous riffs; some racing (eg. 'Dam That River') and some slow and melodic (i.e. Dirt); not to mention plenty of great solos from Jimmy Cantrell's guitar. This album is furthermore a powerful but chiling listen because of the fact that Layne Staley is no longer actually alive. Listening to his tortured, twisted but remarkably powerful voice singing on issues keyly drug taking, in the knowledge that he died from a drug overdose sends a chill down your spine when you listen to this album, believe me. It makes 'Dirt' all the more a difficult listen but at the same time an even more stronger album. Every song on the album is strong, there are few cracks on the album.<br /><br />The album begins with 'Them Bones', a short blasting rocker. Layne Staley's pained screams as the track opens sets the style for the album. This strong opener is followed up by 'Dam That River', a fast paced classic metal song. This song takes no prisoners with its strong style. Staley's lyrics are clever on this song. Next the longer songs set in; 'Rain When I Die' is first. A warped downbeat start leads into a classic riff - Staley's pessimistic demons are there throughout in the lyrics. Next the quieter and strangely beautiful 'Down In A Hole' weaves its greatness. A song about losing the will to succeed, live or achieve anything is this songs theme, a great contrast to the melody of the song. Things then get more aggressive with 'Sickman', plenty of mad lyrics and downcast, inspired riffing call this track home. Then we come to the album's centrepiece, 'Rooster'. A Vietnam inspired song, the guitar sequence opening this song is timeless. The chorus is amazing; with Staley sing 'They've come to snuff the rooster' to some thunderous guitar play; a classic song.<br /><br />However, for me 'Junkhead' is the albums greatest achievement. The song, yes, you've guessed is about drug abuse and its dangers and its made all the more powerful by the fact Staley himself succombed to drug overdose. The lyrical wails on this song are chilling and the 'What's my drug of choice' chorus is a killer. The title track 'Dirt' follows this. Depressing, doom filled, this track is all about negatives - this song is the epitomy of creating the aura of worthlessness. Things then let up slightly with 'Godsmack'. A classic metal sounding song though Staley gives 'some' respite from the ultra depressing lyrics. Following this is a little 40 second 'Dream Sequence', with pounding guitar chords and demon laughs which then leads into 'Hate To Feel', another track were Staley sings about being down and troubled. 'Angry Chair' follows; dark in nature but masterfully crafted. Then we come to 'Would?' which has become an AIC fan favourite. This song is complex and its not quite clear what Staley really wants to convey; however the mystery of the track on top of the songs great riff makes this one a killer - the final line of 'If I would, would you?' leaves the album on a mysterious and haunting note.<br /><br />Alice In Chains, for as much of a fan following as they have, still remain a criminally underrated band. Many ignore their contribution to 90's rock with their great album efforts - they have proven to be very influential besides. 'Dirt' for me is the epitomy of 'grunge'. The band only made three albums but that contribution to rock is more than great; 'Dirt' is the centrepiece of this and more than deserves to go down as one of the greatest albums ever...'What's my drug of choice' chorus is a killer.

B000B2YQX4|4.0|When I first listened to this CD I felt like it fell apart halfway through.  Being a manly man I listened on and then I was suddenly and inexplicably addicted.  When I first heard Damaged People for example, I was like, \\"What is this bizarre attempt at a song?\\"  Now, it is one of my favorite songs on the CD.   <br /> <br />ONE IDEA:  I do think that I Want It All would have been better, and made the entire album better, if it had built to an aggressive crescendo with big heavy drums.   <br /> <br />Lastly, I just hope that they put out a few more albums after this.  They fill a void... <br /> <br />dmh
B000AL730O|4.0|First off, I know this sounds cliche, but this album is a grower. I liked \\"Jenny Wren\\" and \\"This Never Happened Before\\" when I listened the first time, but the rest of the stuff didn't do anything for me. But after a few listens, I've realized there are some other very good songs on here, along with some stuff I'll be skipping over every time. <br /> <br />Many reviewers have complained about this being a boring album. Gimme a break. A song doesn't have to be fast, heavy, and catchy to be good. If you feel otherwise, stick to Linkin Park or something like that. <br /> <br />Aside from the excellent opener \\"Fine Line,\\" and \\"Promise to You Girl,\\" the songs are all mellow. And the stripped-down arrangements contribute to that feeling. But I like it, and think it adds a lot to the mood of the album. <br /> <br />And CACITB, like every McCartney album, has its share of garbage.  Do yourself a favor and skip At the Mercy, A Certain Softness, and Follow Me. Promise to You Girl is catchy, but a bad song.  <br /> <br />The rest of the album is very good. Highlights are Jenny Wren (love that White Album sound), Too Much Rain, Friends to Go, and This Never Happened. And the last track, Anyway, is pretty solid, too. <br /> <br />And I think this album is clearly an improvement over its predecessor Driving Rain. That album had 4 or 5 pretty good songs  and a ton of throwaways. The whole second half of the album (except Magic) was pure crap. So this album is a big improvement.  But it's still got a decent amount of filler, and that means it doesn't come close to Band on the Run.

0790731940|5.0|This is a western because it takes place in the old west but that is not what this film is all about. It is about laughs. It is a comedy that takes place in the old west. <br /> <br />Mel Gibson plays a professional gambler, Brett Maverick,  who wants to pit his skills against the best poker players around in a big tournament. The entry fee is 25,000 and the prize is half a million dollars. He has most of his stake and lots of people owe him money but everything seems to go wrong as he tries to collect the money due him, always with hilarious results. As he makes his way towards to tournament, he encounters another gambler, played by Jodie Foster, who also wants to enter the tournament. She too is a bit short of a stake and will stop at nothing to get into the tournament and this includes playing the vamp and the pickpocket. The final main character is the US Marshall played by James Garner. He does not seem interested in playing poker but he is on his way to the tournament as well. He has been hired to provide security. <br /> <br />As they make their way to the big event, all three of the protagonists take their shots at the others. The Indians get involved and come across as the funniest, most honest and most intelligent people around. They finally get Maverick his stake (with lots of laughs) and the stage is set for the big tournament. <br /> <br />The tournament itself is full of laughs, surprises, twists and turns. It also has a lot of cameo appearances from old time western stars. All of this is fun but the interplay between Gibson, Foster and Garner is the real fun.  <br /> <br />Get this one for the laughs and then prepare to hold your sides while you bust a gut laughing. <br />
0553573403|5.0|I have a personal library of over 5000 books, mostly science fiction and/or fantasy novels.  This does not include the myriads of titles I have borrowed over the years.  I rarely write a review but this time is an exception.  From the realism of the characters to the tight plot and the gripping story, this series has caught my attention.  I am sure you have read many of the over 1200 reviews before this one, so I won't go into a synopsis of the story.  I just wanted to express my opinion and tell you to buy this book!!!
B000AARKOO|5.0|I know zero about Crusade or Templar history but I was amazed by the profound opinions and perceptions of religions in this great movie. Without taking sides, it presents motivations and souls of both Christian and Muslim in the battle to possess Jerusalem, The Holy city. <br /> <br />Some battle scenes may resemble those in LOTR (but with Orlando Bloom not as an elf, of course) but it only proove that LOTR was written and made with deep knowledge.  <br /> <br />Although some may say there are some plots need to be further developed, I don't feel the same way. My attention was pulled to the battle and struggle between the 2 religions and the conflict the Templar had. It brings up the question What is God to men in the Holy Land and What is religion anyway. Nothing and Everything. <br />
B000B0WODA|4.0|These guys from Scotland struck gold with Take Me Out. I only expected more of the same. As is the case with sophomore albums by other bands who tread the line between being radio friendly and artistically credible, like the Strokes and the Shins, they have slightly lost a bit of the magic from, as   Beck put it, \\"busting out onto the scene.\\"  Of course, it must be hard with such a vast fanbase to create something new and yet appeal to the core listeners. They have succeeded in doing just that in this album - hooking up those who listened before, and maybe even attracting a new fan or two.   Don't expect anything exotic here. It is simple infectious danceable pop. You will want to see them play these songs live, in a drunken mob, swaggering. This is the musical equivalent of nutrasweet, so I don't think I will still be listening in four years. They have a wealth of talent that they are hiding in order to sell a lot of records and buy a lot of new jackets, which is respectable, I think, so long as they don't morph into Weezer.   But do not let this detract from the quality of this feast for the ears. Highlights:  1. The Fallen - Delivers a crisp hook with a tasty variation toward the end.  7. Eleanor Put Your Boots On - Commanding melody, vocals that will make you reconsider Eleanor (Fiery Furnaces) 's oft-wailed about blues.  12. Fade Together - I suppose this song is about moral decay and mortality, but I could be reading too much into it. I delight in the drumline.
0694003611|5.0|A classic bedtime book!  I love the mix of color and black and white illustration.  The pages are easy to turn for little hands and the book is full of vocabulary words to introduce to budding talkers!
B000002LGQ|5.0|Madonna has made some  catchy and dance songs,but none so koooo like \\"Express Yourself\\".That has got to be my 3rd favorite song of hers.This album is another \\"mature\\" album.In the song \\"Oh Father\\" she sings about her dad abusing her and that she ran away from him for good.The song \\"Like A Prayer\\" is a very controversial song it made a lot of catholic people angry,but I like it.The songs I didn't find amusing are Cherish and Dear Jessie.My favorites are(in my order):Express Yourself,Keep It Together,Like A Prayer,Till Death Do Us Part and Oh Father.One of the songs that I liked alot besides Express Yourself is Keep It Together because it's very catchy and has kooooo funky beat...and it's koooo!!!A perfect 80's album.I also recommend Thriller by Michael Jackson.
0307276902|5.0|I could not put this book down.  I was compelled by James' story and finished the book in two days.  The book is raw and full of emotion.  James pulls you in on page one and takes the reader on a ride of pain, rage, desperation, and hope.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|I LOVE Depeche Mode.  Plain and simple.  Always have.  I grew up listening to them when everyone else I knew was listening to the standard radio pop.  I just bought this CD and I cannot stop listening to it. I had been a little worried since David Gahan came out with his solo album that there wouldn't be any more great music from Depeche Mode.  Let me just say that they are back and in damn fine form.  This entire album proves that this trio not only still knows how to rock, but that they know how to take it to the next level.  Don't believe me? Just listen to \\"john the revelator\\" or \\"precious\\".  Trust me, even if you are just venturing into the world of Depeche Mode's genius, you must get this cd!!
B000AP04FG|5.0|this movie is really good and so original. angelina and brad rock in it! i thought it would be a flop and have a really stupid and confusing plot. but i was pleasently surprised. i reccomend it to anyone who is a pitt or jolie fan!
B000B9EY2U|5.0|Basically, what Depeche Mode has done with \\"Playing the Angel\\" is rewrite the history of modern music. It's back to the drawing board for Rolling Stone magazine, which will now have <br />to rewrite its essential Top 200 albums of all times. SPIN magazine will have to rewrite its Top 200 of all times, and the British publication Q will have to rewrite its essential Top <br />200. This album is so amazing, so mind-blowing, and so robust, that its hard to even find where to begin in an effort to describe it.  <br /> <br />Let's start with Dave Gahan, whose voice has never sounded better, and whose individual contributions to a DM album have never been so crucial. Or should I start with Martin Gore, <br />whose song-writing and sequenced arrangements have never sounded so lush, so exact, and so lavish. Or should I start with the supporting cast of other musicians and producers, who <br />meshed with the inner core of DM, and pushed their sound, and their creativity into the outer edges of the stratoshpere. Unlike other reviewers of this album, i'm not going to waste  <br />any time comparing it to prior DM albums, as there is no comparison. This album stands alone by itself as without a doubt being the greatest DM album ever released, and it will go down arguably as one of the greatest albums ever made in the history of modern music. And notice that I said \\"modern music\\", and not \\"electronica\\", nor \\"alternative\\" music. <br /> <br />The album gets things going with \\"A Pain That I'm Used To\\", a song that starts off with a synth sample reminiscent of a World War II air raid siren, as if to signify that something of huge importance was about to drop right out of the sky. But instead of some type of bomb, DM drops an infectious synth loop, on top of killer, thumping drumbeat, that will instantly have your foot stomping, and your head bopping. <br />The next song, \\"John the Revelator\\" took me by surprise. Upon seeing the title, I had no idea what to expect from this one, butthe keyboard programming was utterly remarkable, the arrangement was tight, and Dave Gahan did things in this song with his voice that I never knew he was even capable of doing. Then comes track number 3, a song that Dave wrote titled  <br />\\"Suffer Well\\". This song blew my shoes, my socks, my shirt, and my pants off with its hard-driving beat, and hypnotic guitar riff. The guitar riff sounded like something straight off the Peter Gunn soundtrack, with its calculated precision, and its retro feel. Never has a guitar riff sounded so sweet in a DM song. \\"Suffer Well\\" will arguably go down in history as one of the best DM songs ever recorded. The groove continues with cut number 4, \\"The Sinner in Me\\", which is just plain and simple, classic DM. Track number 5 is the first single \\"Precious\\", which keeps the magical journey titled \\"Playing the Angel\\" going with another tight beat, and more examples of just how incredible the synth programming is on this album. And to all the reviewers out here who keep saying this song sounds out of place on this album, I beg to disagree. This song is a perfect transition between \\"The Sinner in Me\\", and track number 6, a song titled \\"Macro\\". \\"Macro\\" is another example of classic DM  <br />lyrics, layered on top of a classic DM sound. Also, the lead vocals in this song are absolutely incredible. \\"Macro\\" is just an utterly amazing song. I could go on and on for hours about the first 6 songs I just briefly overviewed, and I could go on and on for hours about the last 6 songs, however i'm going to just end it here. Of course you will have to listen for yourself and be your own judge, but whether you are a fan from back in the day, or this is the first DM album you've ever heard, I seriously doubt that you will be disappointed.  <br />
B000002H2H|5.0|My title says a mouthful.  Not even the horrible vocal track recording could ruin this CD.  This is Metallica at their best.  From \\"Fight Fire With Fire\\" to \\"Call of Ktulu\\", there's not a wasted moment.  Buy this along with Puppets, Justice, and Kill 'Em All today!
B00003CWTI|5.0|One of my favorites - I can see that some people hate it, but I just can't get enough.
B000002H33|5.0|Everyone laments the passing of Cliff Burton as the biggest trajedy to befall Metallica (besides the decline after the Justice album).  Not to diminish the loss of this musical genious, but the second-biggest trajedy was the firing of Dave Mustaine.  Dave came up some of their best riffs, including Ride the Lightning, The Four Horsemen, and Jump in the Fire, and would have kept the boys on the right track.  Now everyone knows that Dave can't sing, but Rust in Peace, Peace Sells, and to a lesser extent Countdown, contain some of Metal's best tracks. <br /> <br />Back to Puppets, you can't say anything new that hasn't already been said -- this albums is simply one of the best out there!  Buy it, but don't touch anything new recorded after Justice (Live Sh*t excluded).
B0007Y08IS|5.0|When a bunch of foul-mouthed puppets can make a more honest, coherent case for war than George Bush and Colin Powell, it's time to dig that shelter and start worrying. <br /> <br />The whole movie is hilarious -- I laughed until I nearly swallowed my tongue.  Until I realized that this might be a more accurate picture of reality than a lot of the nightly news.   <br /> <br />Meanwhile, the movie's Kim Jong Il emerges as one of the greatest comic creations since Daffy Duck said \\"You're dethpicable.\\"  Somehow they manage to make a classic out of a line like, \\"Now take your weapons of mass destwuction, and GET THE **** OUT OF HERE!!\\" <br /> <br />Definitely not for kids, but recommended for registered voters. <br />
B00000FCBC|3.0|First of all, aside from the Merciful Fate Medley and the Sabbra Caddabra covers, throw away the first disc.  You'll thank me that you didn't have to suffer through Tuesday's Gone. <br /> <br />The second disc is the real reason to buy this album.  This disc collects all covers/b-sides from Garage Days Revisited (the b-side to the UK edition of the Creeping Death single) with Am I Evil? and Blitzkrieg to the whole Motorhead-Ache EP with everything in between.  Am I Evil, Breadfan, Stone Cold Crazy and Last Caress are the highlights. <br /> <br />I hear over and over again that fans cannot expect a rehashing of the past with Master of Puppets parts 2, 3, ect., however, when you purport to be true to your fans and then release \\"Re-Load\\", then you no longer can expect blind devotion.  \\"St. Anger\\" was at least an attempt, albeit completely unstructured and counterproductive, at returning to their roots.  Bottom line, with Rob on board I will look forward to the next cd but won't hold my breath.
B00007ELEL|5.0|The plot is simple enough: Stoned loser is mistaken for someone else, and accidentally becomes caught up in what may or may not be a kidnapping, occasionally accompanied by his slightly crazed bowling pal. We've all seen that a million times. But as usual, the Coen brothers deliver a movie  that's unlike anything you've ever seen- dream sequences that echo Busby Berkly musicals, starring the stoned, robe wearing Dude? A mustachioed cowboy- played by Sam Elliott- who shows up briefly to provide a bit of narration and perspective? What's going on here? What's going on is  an outrageous, hilarious comedy probably unlike any film you've ever seen. It's good natured throughout, even at its most (seemingly) violent moments. Like all Coen Brothers films it's filled with memorable characters- John Turutrro's violet clad bowler, Steve Buscemei's dimwitted \\"Donny\\", an entirely over the top John Goodman as The Dude's wound way too tight bowling partner, Phillip Seymour Hoffman in yet another of his curious little characters, and many more. Don't watch this one with the kids- as The Stranger says to The Dude, \\" Do you have to use so many cuss words?\\" But for the grownups, it's a winner.
B000A7DVR2|4.0|The Big Lebowski needs no introduction to its legions of fans, but we get just that: a brand new introduction by Mortimer Young of Forever Young film preservation.  This Coen brothers' character gives a short introduction to, as he calls it, \\"The Grand Lebowski.\\"  There's a little more to this DVD than a silly introduction.  Improved picture and sound quality bring some welcome improvements to the watching experience, but only to discerning ears.  Unfortunately, modern commercial DVD tactics infiltrate the Dude's new disc, with previews automatically popping up at the beginning.   <br /> <br /> The quality of the sound is improved over the original DVD version.  Though the menu music sounds decidedly low-fi, the movie itself sounds great; one Lebowski urban achiever who screened this collector's edition with me noticed at least two places in the first ten minutes where the audio has been cleaned up from the original DVD release, starting right off the bat with the opening song Tumbling Tumbleweeds.  The movie does sound better than the original DVD. <br /> <br /> The image quality appears to be improved over the first version, and it can be fairly noticeable in nighttime scenes.  The first dream sequence displays a very sharp night view of Los Angeles.  Unfortunately, other parts of the movie are not as nice, with some artifacts and noise popping up in the blue sky; these minor problems can be fairly easily overlooked, though.  On the whole, though, the video is improved over the original DVD release. <br /> <br /> The special features are nothing to write home about - a pre-programmed three minute 20 second slide show are all we get of Jeff Bridges's photography from the film's set, though a few interesting shots and notes pop up.  Simply getting a behind the scenes look is interesting, though not alone worth paying to buy the movie again.  The Production Notes contain a few bits of trivia, but nothing too revelatory for most Lebowski fanatics. <br /> <br /> The improved image and sound quality will be a welcome improvement to audio and videophiles, but the video is not as flawless as one may expect.  If you don't already own a copy, pick up the new version, the improved images are worth a couple extra dollars.   <br /> <br /> The biggest questions for many Lebowski fans may be, \\"Should I buy this again?  Do I need a second copy of Lebowski for my collection?\\"  If you have a little spare cash in your budget, rediscover the movie with a slightly better image version and much clearer audio.  But let's hope for something much better in the future; this may be a ringer, but it's filled with something better than just the dirty undies, man.
B000B2YQX4|5.0|DM is my favorite band of all time.  While I'd highly recommend this album, I'd recommend the following before this one: <br />Black Celebration <br />Exciter <br />Music For the Masses <br />Violator <br /> <br />It always takes me a while to really get into an album, especially a good one.  I don't feel like I've listened to this album enough times yet to make a perfect judgement, and my opinion may well change in the future, but this is what I think at the moment. <br /> <br />This is a very good album, more than worthy of 5 stars, but they do have better ones. <br /> <br />Pros: <br />o All the songs are very good, but some are particularly great; right now I'm particularly fond of Precious, Suffer Well, and Damaged People. <br />o I agree with what people have said, that Precious is one of their best singles. <br />o It's a DM album, and anything at all by them is great, far above most other bands <br /> <br />Cons: <br />o A little too much guitar at times.  I'm a big fan of synth, and while some guitar (especially accoustic) can be nice at times, I can always tell where synth would have sounded 100% better to me if they'd used it instead of guitar (this applies to most bands, not just DM). <br />o Sounds at times like they were purposely backing away from the Exciter sound somewhat, and I love Exciter, one of their best albums.  I don't mind a move in a new direction, that's good, but I never like when bands purposely avoiding past albums and sounds and such, because those almost always turn out to be things I particularly liked. <br />o It seems like it could have used a little more work in the studio here and there, because it sounds a little rough in a few places, maybe intentionally, but maybe not.  And there's a few particularly strong ideas in some of the tracks that I wish had been pursued more fully, maybe extended farther into the rest of the song (like a particularly dramatic moment in Suffer Well that could have been the basis of a whole song ideaon it's own).  There's a making-of on the DVD and (if I'm remembering right) the guy working with them on the album seemed very proud of the concept that they were hurrying the recording process.  I'm not so sure that was such a good idea, and maybe the album could have been even better with some more time on it. <br /> <br /> <br />A few reviewers have said they don't like Damaged People that much, but I have to totally and completely disagree: it is a GREAT song.  It is a little experimental sounding (to me that's a good thing), and also sounds very DM to me, as well (frankly, I wish they'd done a few more tracks along these lines).  I'd go farther by saying that every song on the album is very strong quality. <br /> <br />All that said, I still fully expect to be doing another review in the future once I get more familiar with this album.  But I think this will remain at 5 stars. <br />
B00005JOI3|4.0|Visually, this movie was amazing.  There were so many visual trickeries in this movie that my eyes were glued to the screen, hoping not to miss any cool details.  \\"Stay\\" heavily deals with the question, \\"what is real?\\" and if you pay attention to what's going on in the background, you'll be asking \\"is this real?\\" too.  In fact, I heard one guy in the theater blurt out, \\"what the *bleep* is going on??\\" in one scene.<br /><br />What I really enjoyed was the fact that the visuals, despite all the cool trickeries, did not seem overwhelming or over the top.  In fact, it came just short of being over the top.  In less capable hands, all the cool camera angles, fades and transitions, filter effects, and interior set pieces would have ended up being overblown and cheesy.  The director Marc Foster and all the people behind cinematography, CG effects, and production design deserve a major standing ovation for their efforts.<br /><br />I'm being more subjective here, but I absolutely loved the music too.  Fittingly atmospheric and trippy, the music adeptly underscored the visuals, and I'll be sure to get the soundtrack CD.<br /><br />However, I have to say that I took objection to the movie's use of the song \\"Angel\\" by Massive Attack.  Now, I love Massive Attack, and I really like the song \\"Angel.\\"  It's just that I've already heard that same song used in dreamy/trippy scenes in several other movies.  Massive Attack's vibe fits the movie perfectly well, so I don't mind their choice in the band.  But why couldn't they use one of Massive Attack's lesser known but just as atmospheric and trippy songs instead?  Hearing that song in \\"Stay\\" made me go, \\"oh no, not again,\\" and took me out of the film.<br /><br />All in all, \\"Stay\\" was a huge treat for my eyes and ears.<br /><br />Beyond all the production gloss, however, I have to confess that I walked away from the theater feeling a bit underwhelmed.  There just wasn't enough substance to tie it all together.  A lot of the visual cool stuff ended up being just that: cool stuff, and nothing more.  It's like receiving a big gift box, spending time rattling it to guess what's inside, only to unwrap it and discover that it's just one piece of Godiva chocolate in a big fluffy packaging.  Still delicious, and you'd rather have it than not, but at the same time, it's disappointing, and the joy is too fleeting.  Without all the visual fluff, the story of \\"Stay\\" probably could have been told in one 45-minute \\"Outer Limits\\" or \\"Twilight Zone\\" episode.<br /><br />Acting-wise, I thought Ryan Gosling hit the perfect note for his role.  Naomi Watts gave a decent, if not particularly memorable, performance.  Ewan McGregor's performance, however, was a bit of a mixed bag.  There were moments where I thought he nailed it perfectly, and then there were moments where I thought he simply fell flat.  I like Ewan, but he more often than not seems to have at least one such moment in all his films, and that's such a shame.<br /><br />Speaking of which, I have to say that Bob Hoskins was amazing.  He was amazing in \\"Unleashed,\\" and he was amazing in \\"Stay.\\"  And sadly, his performance will probably go unnoticed by many.<br /><br />Overall, I enjoyed this movie.  I'm a sucker for \\"what is real?\\"-type storylines, and if \\"Stay\\" had more substance to it, I probably would have given it a 4.5-star rating.  As it is, the movie deserves about 3 or 3.5 stars.  But I really, really loved the visual flair of this film, and I dug the atmosphere it created.  And since Amazon won't let me do ratings in 0.5 increments, I'm bumping it up to a 4-star rating.<br /><br />By the way, if you are interested in watching this film, then do go to a theater and watch it on a big screen.  I feel that \\"Stay\\"'s visual flair just won't be the same on a smaller TV screen.visual cool stuff ended up being just that: cool stuff, and nothing more.

B0002IQHY8|5.0|With a focus more on electronic music the new album from Alan Parsons is certainly quite different from the last, but fans of Alan Parsons previous instrumental works should love this album.
B0000029J5|5.0|Keb' Mo' sings in a deep, mellow voice and plays a beautiful guitar, including a National; he has a special way of immediately capturing your attention and not letting go till he's done. He is at his absolute best when staying within the old blues tradition (12-bar, down-home tunes, just him and his guitar): his version of Robert Johnson's KINDHEARTED WOMAN is a perfect example of this. It goes right to the gut emotionally, but is still lyrical and melodic. Other highlights are EVERY MORNING and LOVE BLUES (he also blows harp on this last mentioned tune).There are a couple of duds on the CD, but the better performances are so good they make up for them. Worth checking out.
