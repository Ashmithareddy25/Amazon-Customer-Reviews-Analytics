B0042JTDXK|2.0|The songs on the new album do nothing for Josh's beautiful voice and the feeling he has been able to put into each song he has recorded in the past.  I just don't get the same goose-bumps from this album.  I still love you Josh and can't wait 'til you tour AUSTIN, TX.!
B002PMV9FG|2.0|Watching Harry Potter and the Half Blood Prince, is like listening to a children's choir where all the children are a little off key. Each Harry Potter contains a lot more material then can be put into a movie. The difficulty is choosing what to put into the movie and then sanding over the parts you miss. As the novels have gotten larger, the job of the film makers has gotten more difficult. However, up until this point they have done a reasonably good job of finding a rhythm that works in telling the broader story (even if it is a little different then that of JK Rowlings).   With this film it feels like they didnt know what direction they were going in and ended up trying to do too much, but ended up not doing enough. Characters like Hagrid and Prof Mcgonagall who played larger roles in earlier movies are now just given cameos. It might have been better had they just left the characters out entirely so they could create a less fragmented story line without as many distractions. They also spent way too much time on Quidditch (which JK Rowling even said she only put in for the fans) and the teen romances.   This wouldnt have mattered if they had not glimpsed over key areas. 1) They spent so little time explaining the significance of the potions book, to the point that most of the people that didnt read the book had no idea who the half blood prince was after the movie. 2) They left out most of the lessons that Harry had with Dumbledore and shortened the ones they did show. These lessons are so key to book 7, I hope that the audience will be able to follow along.  There seemed to be some bad casting with the Prof Slughorn and the young Tom Riddle characters. Each year a new colorful character is brought in for the DATDO teacher. Lockhart, Moody, and Umbridge in particular are some of the most colorful characters I know of and have provided ample material for the movies. Slughorn shouldn't be any different. Slughorn should come off as a sort of 19th century politicianor aristocrat. He should be round, proud, jolly, but also cunning. Instead he is thin, aloof, and awkward. I wonder if Jim Broadbent has read and loved these books, or if he is simply looking for another notch on the resume and paycheck in the bank account. Then Tom Riddle was played like the kid from the Omen. Noone would ever believe this kid was anything other then trouble and he does not seem that clever. I thought that Christian Coulson in the Chamber of Secrets really captured tom riddle better as charming, handsome, and mature.  Finally, I have to admit that it isnt just the new actors. All of the actors were off key. Even the main trio and seasoned actors like Michael Gambon who have played brilliantly in previous movies felt flat. It is almost like they are tired of the movies. I just hope that the seventh and eighth film show more heart, because these actors will never get another opportunity.
0938045695|4.0|I started the ETK program in June 2010.  I finished the first phase, the Program Minimum in October 2010 and as of writing this review I am still working on the Right of Passage.  Note: I'm an average 48 year old male.<br /><br />The good:<br />The program as written is very effective, time efficient, space efficient and cost effective over time.  It just plain works.  Starting with the Program Minimum (PM) you will concentrate on only two exercises, the swing and turkish getup.  The swing will really improve your overall conditioning as well as core, glute, hamstring, and back strength.  The turkish getup will really hit your core and greatly improve shoulder stability.  The catch?  You must perform the exercises correctly.  Having a session with a RKC is highly recommended.  Yes the book, kettlebell(s) and a session or two with a RKC is hefty up front cost but a one time cost.  Spread out over time it will be one of the best investments you can make in your health.  The Right of Passage (RoP) adds the clean & press and kettlebell snatch and pullups to your exercise plan.  Workouts will increase in length under the RoP but can still be completed in under one hour, under a half hour for the light day.  Your strength and conditioning really get a serious bump up on this RoP.<br /><br />Both the PM and RoP have very sensible progressions that do not leave you feeling wiped out, super sore, or discouraged.  Instead they set you up for success and allow you to keep building on that success workout after workout.  Before you know it you'll look in the mirror and go, \\"Whoa, when did that happen?\\".<br /><br />The cons:<br />Like all Dragon Door books there is too much cross marketing.  It's a turn off to me.  I can mostly ignore it but I think it diminishes the overall reading experience.  Many of Pavel's books, the ETK included, goof around just a little too much.  It comes of a little to cute and wears thin after a few pages.  It's a shame because there is some really great info in the book and the DVD.  I'm sure this turns some off and makes them take the book less seriously.  Do yourself a favor and just work the program, you'll become a believer.<br /><br />The book lays out both programs, the PM and RoP, but doesn't present them in an easy to follow format.  I think this is a mistake.  Many people, especially beginners, want to follow a step by step program.  The Art of Strength site has created an easy to follow ETK workbook that fills this gap but I think the workout progression should have been laid out better in the book and some sort of workbook should have been included on the DVD.<br /><br />All things considered, I'm very happy I purchased and started the ETK program.  If you can overlook the minor annoyances listed above and set aside 30-60 minutes several times a week to transform your strength and conditioning without setting foot in a gym I believe you'll be very happy with the results.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Oh the agonies of being Bruce Springsteen. You have recorded what many consider to be one of the best ever rock albums in 1975's high adrenaline anthem laden \\"Born to Run\\", you have been proclaimed the \\"future of rock n roll\\" and expectations are running at a fever pitch that after a three year lay off compounded by legal disputes you are about to release \\"Born to Run - part 2\\". So what do you do? Answer - like all great artists you confound expectations and by doing so release the brooding and primal masterpiece 1978's \\"Darkness on the edge of town\\". On it Springsteen combined songs like \\"Adam raised a Cain\\" that contained so much raw fury it could have started a war with the sheer unadulterated beauty of other songs like the towering \\"Racing in the street\\". In addition with his well known prolificness he recorded enough material to literally swamp the 16 track equipment of New York's legendary Record Plant.<br /><br />The Darkness sessions are now captured in all their glory on a huge box set release and hopefully Santa's elves have already packed it in a parcel marked \\"Cardiff\\". But in the meantime we have the music that got left behind from those sessions captured on this essentially \\"new\\" double album \\"The Promise\\" and frankly your humble reviewer has died and gone to heaven. This album represents a completely essential addition to the Springsteen canon and must be viewed as one of his great seventies albums albeit over thirty years late. \\"The Promise\\" very much prefigures \\"The River\\" and is packed full of so many styles from joyous jukebox rock n roll such as the Buddy Holly like thumping \\"Outside looking in\\" and the wonderful soulful Graham Parker sounding \\"Talk to me\\". Then we have huge slow Roy Orbison infused poignant ballads such as \\"The Brokenhearted\\", the songs which must have been on the reserve list for \\"Darkness\\" such \\"Come on (lets go tonight)\\" marking Elvis's death and the brilliant title track previously included on \\"18 tracks\\".<br /><br />What other artists other than Dylan have given away brilliant songs as cavalierly as Springsteen? Thus finally we get to hear his studio versions of the two uber hits \\"Because the Night\\" (Patti Smith) and \\"Fire\\" (Pointer Sisters). Smith's version of \\"Because\\" probably has the edge but then it is one of the most viscerally powerful cover versions ever and Springsteen's does come close (and anyway he wrote the bloody song). \\"Fire\\" is a sheer delight stripped of the \\"pop\\" of the Pointer Sisters it becomes a sexy rock song full of dirty Clemons sax solos and a brilliant vocal by the Boss. Throughout the E Street Band are tighter than a shark with lock jaw and when it all clicks together on songs like the Roy Bittan piano driven \\"Spanish eyes\\" or the redemptive roar of \\"Gotta get a feeling\\" it is the musical equivalent of Category 5 hurricane and destroys everything in its wake. It is guaranteed that the sing-along \\"Ain't good enough for you\\" will have your smile fixed like the Joker and believing in the redemptive power of rock n roll.<br /><br />And then there is \\"Racing in the Street (`78)\\" and \\"Someday (we will be together)\\". The first is a version of the moody ballad filled with latent regret on Darkness which is transformed into a huge piano and a high lonesome harmonica driven \\"River\\" style anthem which absolutely laid to me waste when I first played it and it has been on repeat since. It contains one of Springsteen's greatest vocals and shows that the man is touched by the angels. Similarly \\"Someday\\" shows that when it comes to doomed romanticism Springsteen has an all encompassing monopoly and hearing this superb song it was like being transported back to those heady days in the seventies when I played his music so much that every member of my family would hum his songs around the house and ask \\"who is that\\"?<br /><br />Unlike the patchy mopping up exercise \\"Tracks\\" which had variable quality spread over its 4 disc compilation (although \\"Thundercrack\\" is one of the seven wonders of the world) \\"The Promise\\" feels like a unified whole. In Springsteen's own words it is a \\"fully realised piece of work\\" which shows that he knew precisely what he wanted from \\"Darkness\\", an album that would stand as a polar opposite to its predecessor. In doing so however he had to jettison songs of such verve and quality that you can only gasp at his audacity since many artists would lose a limb to pen songs of this depth and strength.<br /><br />So there you have it, a \\"promise\\" delivered. The Boss and the E Street Band at their absolute peak, 21 peerless songs, a great lost work recovered and easily one of the best albums released in 2010. What more do you really want from life?e Promise\\" feels like a unified whole.

031603438X|5.0|Keith Richards frequently refers to himself as a troubadour, a traveling musician, a member of a venerable entertainment tradition. I find him utterly fascinating and of course bought \\"Life\\" the day it was released. Keith's book succeeds marvelously at entertaining, by turns hilarious, shocking, moving, insightful, and never boring. Co-author James Fox does a skillful job transcribing and organizing Keith's stories, capturing on the page Keith's voice as you've heard on the chat shows or read in the transcribed \\"Rolling Stone\\" interviews. It was also a pleasure to read the contributions from other characters sprinkled throughout the book, particularly Keith's wife, son, and the New Zealand doctor who did the brain surgery after his fall out of a tree in Fiji. I savored it slowly, and felt a sense of dread when I reached page 500 because I knew the book would soon be over.     \\"Life\\" begins with yet another escape from the jaws of law enforcement, a bust in Fordyce, Arkansas, in a car loaded down with drugs. In the end, the judge lets Keith off in exchange for a photo op and Keith's knife, which hangs on the wall in his courtroom to this day. It's just one illustration of the relatively charmed life Keith has led--aided by celebrity, limitless money and legal talent, of course. Then the story goes back to the beginning, Keith's working-class childhood in the bleak post-war London suburb of Dartford, and proceeds more or less chronologically.     Keith's passion for music sparkles throughout even the bleakest, most drug-addled parts of the story. I can't play guitar and don't want to learn, but he brings such enthusiasm to the technical material that I read it with interest. There are too many enjoyable stories of playing with the Stones and with other musicians to enumerate. His admiration for other musicians shines. It's obvious that the real addiction for Keith is and always will be music. He says he'll never retire. He's not playing for money or for the audience,he's doing it for himself. He simply could not have done anything else with his life but be a troubadour.     Much has been made in the mainstream media about the druggy sections and catty remarks about Mick Jagger. Well, the druggy sections were to be expected, and I thought they were handled with candor, avoided glamorization, and and vividly captured the desperation, even for someone with Keith's extraordinary resources. How many people would admit that they charged their young son with responsibility for waking them up when they nodded off while driving stoned, and keeping the drug paraphernalia out of sight in hotel rooms? Keith does, and his son Marlon, who was that boy, is quoted extensively about that period. While it's easy to quote salacious Jagger swipes in the tabloids, Keith's periodic feuding with Mick has gone on in the media for decades so those comments in \\"Life\\" are hardly news. What has not been mentioned much at all about \\"Life\\" is Keith's expansiveness in crediting and praising Mick's contributions to their songwriting (Mick's prowess as a lyricist is enthused upon repeatedly) and his respect for Jagger's musicianship and showmanship. It's as if Keith's jabs are pleading to Mick, \\"Come on, I know there's something authentically wonderful in there. Let it out!\\"     Keith doesn't always get what he wants. The section dealing with the death of his infant son Tara (his third child with Anita Pallenberg) bleeds off the page. He packs his daughter Angela (the second child with Anita) off to be brought up by his mother Doris, as it's obvious that Anita is not a fit mother. Marlon goes back and forth, spending some time on the road with Keith as sort of a mini-minder. Much has he loves Anita, Keith can't stop her going too far off the rails even for him, and he has to leave her to save himself.    Keith does eventually get what he needs. His loyal manager, Jane Rose, gets him to stop procrastinating and get off heroin for good. She facilitates his getting together with Patti Hansen, a supermodel from Staten Island who happens to be a devout Christian, in the winter of 1979. Keith and Patti will celebrate their 27th wedding anniversary in December and have two grown daughters. They each speak charmingly about their courtship and their relationship 30 years on. His two surviving children with Anita are, to his evident delight, happy and well-adjusted. Anita eventually sobers up and becomes a doting granny. He finds outlets with other musical projects when he's not doing Rolling Stones stuff. The last chapter is full of goofy grandfatherly anecdotes about family gatherings and holidays, his homes, his library, his musical tastes, his hobbies, and his pets. You'll learn lots of little tidbits you may not have known--I didn't know he rides horses and skis, but he does. He understands his outlaw image, he's sort of reconciled to it, and at times he gleefully plays into it, but he shows the reader a great deal more: keen intelligence, humor, loyalty, firm grounding in the love of family and friends, curiosity, and an incredible work ethic. No wonder he and the Stones have survived and thrived where so many others have fallen.     \\"Life\\" is well worth the price of admission. Get the physical book rather than the e-book so you can fully appreciate the many black-and-white and color photos.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|I have been listening online to this album for a week and I love it.  As Rock himself has said, he is getting older and his music reflects that. He is not screaming and cussing and \\"saying his name\\" all the time like he did 10 years ago - he doesn't have to. He has grown as a singer, songwriter and performer.  As a longtime fan of him, I really appreciate it.  This sounds like it might have come out in the 70s era of Skynyrd and the Eagles and Seger, which is the kind of music I gravitate towards now that I am getting older myself.  I thought \\"Rock and Roll Jesus\\" was a good album but \\"Born Free\\" is even better.  As a Michigander, I appreciate all of the free promotion Rock gives to our state, including shooting his beautiful video in the UP.      Get this album.  You won't regret it.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Thanks to Amazon's awesomeness, I received this set a day early and even though I haven't gone through the entire set 100 per cent it is easily the most comprehensive and complete version of the film (pray there isn't another box set :P)      I never saw the rerelease in theaters so diving into the collector's edition cut of the film was damn close to a new movie. The added scenes really fleshed out both the Na'vi and the humans' clash over minerals and nicely rounded out the characters. There are several alternate scenes in the collector's cut detailed in other reviews so I won't recycle the same info.     Audio and video are top-notch. The DTS-HD Master Audio will slay your setup with a very active soundstage. The included Family Audio track is pretty hilarious to listen to as well :) The vivid colors really POP on the screen and the crispness of the textures bring out minute details only Blu ray can provide. This is reference material, folks.     The packaging is killer: a sturdy cardboard sleeve houses the discs in a binded book-like case. The discs are housed in little \\"drawers\\" that slide out on the \\"pages\\" almost like a pop-out book. Very nice.      Overall, the added scenes round out an amazing movie and the added bonus content looks very thorough. At $25 (prerelease), a MUST OWN set! Even if you bought the earlier theatrical disc this is a behemoth for the hardcore fans, practically a godsend.
076781326X|1.0|Cut about 30 minutes off the original musical.  Missed about 5 songs including \\"Where is Love\\" and \\"Gotta Pick a Pocket or Two\\".  Major league disappointment.
159448385X|4.0|This is an exceptionally written book. The story is powerfully moving. I feel it allows for a greater understanding of women's roles in Afghanistan today...which makes it even more tragic. Ultimately, the detailed and vivid description of the domestic abuse that is prevalent throughout the book made it very challenging to read...it made my stomach twist and almost too frightened to turn the page. It is a deeply heartbreaking book.
B004BC7MRM|2.0|I've been a Kid Rock fan since Devil, and after hearing that album, I went back to his older stuff to soak it all in.  All I can say is that I loved the Rock part of Kid Rock all these years, and I don't feel like he's doing that anymore.  This album belongs in the country category more than any album I've ever listened to in my 30 years on this planet.  I will say this right now, I'm not a country fan, but I loved Rock N Roll Jesus, thought it was some of his best material, and have seen him in concert something like 7 times in the Detroit area.  This album just doesn't feel like Kid Rock to me.  It's a consistantly slow effort.  I loved some of his slow tracks from previous albums, but I also loved it when he took it up a notch and kicked the place apart.  I will say that this album is consistant, and if consistancy is always what you've been looking for in a KR album, this is where you should look.  Just don't look for anything that's going to rock very hard, or give you the energy his previous efforts did.
B001ACH4DS|1.0|I loved D Cook but this CD is not that great.  The 12th song has a very long (4 minutes) blank section at the end. I even ordered another one thinking I had a defective CD, but the next one was the same.  Forget this one.
B0043URV8M|3.0|Alexandre Desplat is the latest composer to try his hand at upholding- or as some might say, restoring- the Harry Potter musical legacy.  Since John Williams' departure each subsequent composer has wanted to imprint their own identity upon the franchise- a perfectly reasonable approach, but this means there's been no real continuity with the music since.  Desplat is on record stating he'd incorporate some of the existing cues from the Williams' years, but this could be a result of studio pressure.  From what I've read, other than an insistence on the 'Hedwig Theme' being carried over into the other works- and makes very few appearances here- everyone's been left to their own devices, hence the resulting chaos.  In full disclosure I've never read the books or seen the films, but as a soundtrack fan I was eager to check out this highly anticipated score, so my apologies if I've missed any significant cues ... but I ain't that impressed.<br /><br />The main cue is a somber four-note piece appearing in differing forms- flute, horn, but mostly cello.  A three-note solo, usually on flute, is associated with it in most cases.  It's an interesting ideal, appearing in both heroic and villainous forms.<br /><br />Some highlights:<br />Obliviate- Starts with a low tonal intro with some intermitten percussion beats dropped in before building into a somber ostinato string rush at 0:34 which forms the base of the track.  Added to this is a ghostly three-note solo horn that leads into another four-note French horn motif which alternates on the last beat.  At 1:18 the piece comes together in full with stronger horns and includes a seven-note flute cue.  At 1:40 it dips back into its minimal intro and brings in a cello version of the four-note horn, rising back into the seven-note motif on string.  From 2:26 the fullness of the piece comes in very dramatically.<br /><br />Harry & Ginny- Opens with melancholy solo piano notes reminiscent of the old 'Incredible Hulk' tv show closing theme.  At 0:27 the higher strings rise with a touch of harp strings underneath.  At 0:50 the solo piano returns with a mid-string support before closing with the strings and harp.<br /><br />Death Eaters- Begins as a darker alternate to Obliviate; perhaps some juxtaposition here?  Forlorn lower strings start it off before blending into a solo cello reprise of the four-note motif.  At 1:20 the strings branch off into a transition before coming back to the dark side at 1:49 with a menacing ostinato rush accompanied by choral chants.  Then at 2:07 there's a nice, brief transition before having some malevolent fun the rest of the way with the strings and muted trumpet.<br /><br />Dobby- Classic Disney-style playful intro with oboe, harp, mandolin, xylophone and high hat and middle strings before taking on an air of danger at 1:40.  A six-note harp and chime combo inserted over some tension strings builds the anxiety until 2:20 when a brief Godfather-like transition occurs until 2:38 where lower and middle strings layer over each other with some tinkling chimes.  Nice rush at the end.<br /><br />Ron Leaves- Melancholy solo cello opens on the now familiar four-note motif.  A second layer is added with a viola reprise and lower string support at 0:48.  Harp, higher strings and brass enter at 1:10.  At 1:52 the high strings take over with some brass and very high tension string making for an emotional departure.  Not bad.<br /><br />Lovegood- Mandolin and rhythm guitar with high hat starts it off.  A staggered piano progression introduces a touch of madness to the proceedings accompanied by an Asian pan flute before using a traditional woodwind.  At 1:00 comes in the fuller strings and a brief flute to underscore things.  The shakers and snaps in the background are a nice touch.  The uniqueness of it all makes for an interesting listen, but is largely repetitive.<br /><br />Captured & Tortured- Strong, driving timpani drums illustrate the danger.  Layers of solo tension strings start building at 0:44 before a brief lull leads back into the four-note main motif on lower strings at 1:34.  Not much happening after that.<br /><br />'Deathly Hallows Pt 1' is very well composed in places but unsustained- like Desplat got distracted by something and forgot where he left off so he started all over again.  Pieces feel slap-dashed together too many times, never sure of what they're supposed to be. It only seems to come into its own during the really dramatic moments.  Despite some good ideas the only real attraction is its place in the franchise.  It's more miss than hit and won't hold your attention very long.o the four-note main motif on lower strings at 1:34.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|I have always appreciated Norah Jones and her music, but this new album blew me away.  All the collaborations on the album are different & show the many sides of Norah and her talent.  One of my favorite songs was \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" performed with Willie Nelson because I love, love, love Christmas music & their voices sounds amazing together.  \\"Virginia Moon\\" with the Foo Fighters and \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton are another couple of my favorites.  She also performs with rap, hip-hop & jazz artists, completely showing her range in music and performing.  Each song is an effortless duet, it never sounds like it actually took them work to perform together.  I would recommend this new album to anyone who likes the relaxing sound of Norah Jones, you will not regret this purchase.

B0045MPPJK|5.0|Very refreshing.  Only a couple songs that regurgitate the same old \\"I'm rich, I get lots of women, I'm the best\\" message most rap albums seem to convey.  Even when that is the message, its a bit tongue in cheek.<br /><br />Worth a spin or two... its one of those \\"grow on you\\" albums.  But it sticks like crazy glue after the second or third listen.<br /><br />Also, I should note that originally the digital booklet did not download correctly, but Amazon support was awesome about this and made the situation right as rain.
B003YY8KF6|5.0|One2One  Network gave me the opportunity to listen and review Norah Jones' latest project, \\" Featuring Norah Jones\\". At first reading of the album, I thought that I was holding an ambitious project which contained a complete compendium of musical genres. There have been many Duet albums in the marketplace. What is intriguing about this particular type of Duet Albums is the fact that Norah Jones displays her versatility by dabbling in other genres. The album makes for easy listening with tracks such as \\"Virginia Moon\\", \\"Ruler of My Heart\\" and \\"Blue Bayou\\" (my personal favorite). \\"Baby Its Cold\\" is a sweet spin of an old Christmas Classic. Norah's hip-hop collaborations with Q-Tip and OutKast shows that Norah has the ability to take risks that pay off with great dividends. Her numerous collaborations are laudable. I give it 5 stars because it is great! Yet, I wonder, whether she could have done some collaboration with some of the younger musical talent. Another album. Possibly.
B003E6K1VK|5.0|Fiio is being very aggressive with it's products - in a good way, nonetheless. Well priced with great value. The Fiio E7 is a portable Amp/DAC that goes very well with your ipod-like device. The sound quality is noticeably improved, especially using the Line Out Dock - LOD. The bass is much better on my music now, and its better presented overall.   Just know that while it's great as a DAC, the AMPing part is kinda shy, so don't expect being able to drive those 600ohm cans. This wasn't a problem for me, but you should know your requirements beforehand. This is what it is - a $100 portable DAC and you shouldn't expect miracles (i'm rating SQ based on its price point, of course). But if you ask me, it's a hell of a deal. So much that i intend to buy the Fiio E9 to complement it on my desktop system.   Highly recommended.

B000V5TV22|4.0|I like it. It does a very good job but the cord could stand to be a couple of feet longer. I use it in my car and in my tractor trailer. It works great with my truck routing program but as I said the cord need to be longer so that it will reach the visor above the windshield. That's the only reason that it got 4 stars instead of 5.
B004259BMM|5.0|I know Amazon won't appreciate this but this is directed towards Keith fans that will hopefully read this review before buying the album. For some reason that I have not been able to figure out as of yet the release of Get Closer only has 8 songs on it, HOWEVER, Target exclusively sells a Deluxe version of this album with the extra new songs (bringing the total of new songs to 11) as well as 4 live songs. Why this is only at Target I do not know but that deluxe version is definately worth it. It cost me $11.99. The album itself is great and why I gave it 5 stars. In my opinion it is far better than Defying Gravity with Keith's guitar much more prominent than on some past recordings (check out the end to Georgia Woods, he tears it up). The central theme is obviously loved based but the music itself is very well done and very enjoyable. In conclusion, go to Target and get the deluxe version!!!
B001JAFYFG|3.0|This review is for the blu-ray edition.    Given the amount of reviews for this film, it's unlikely that I can add much to the discussion that hasn't already been brought up.  In the 23rd Century, life is an idyllic eden (if you consider hanging out at the mall an idyllic eden) inside controlled domes where there is no pain or disease or unhappiness - but in order to achieve this utopia, life is limited to 30 years.  Michael York, as the sandman Logan, is part of a police force responsible for enforcing this way of life, and hunting down those that 'run' from their fate.  But a secret network of discontents hold out a promise of a place beyond the dome, a place called Sanctuary, and when Logan is tasked with finding this hidden refuge, he must leave behind his life of luxury and become a runner himself.      This is probably the first time I've seen the film since its initial release back in 1976 - I was too young to grasp all that was going on at that time, but there were many points in the film that I still remembered, so apparently it made a big impression on me.  Watching again these years later, I find the result is a bit underwhelming.  That's more or less what I expected - by seeking this movie out, I was probably looking more to revisit a younger state of mind than for a mind blowing movie experience.  Still, I enjoyed both the film and the nostalgia, even if the story calls for more suspension of disbelief than I'm willing to grant it anymore.  Those who have not seen the movie and have grown used to the effects-laden films of our time are likely to sneer at this film's attempt to be futuristic - I'll tell you that, believe it or not, it WAS pretty cool back in the day, but it looks pretty thin now in comparison to today's effects.         Aside from those issues, there are also a lot of holes in the plot that are probably acceptable if you don't think too hard.  According to the commentary, there were several scenes cut either for length or for the PG rating - if those scenes are available, it would be nice to have them included.  I imagine they are lost, but evidently one was an extended scene of Logan and Jessica in the ice cavern with Box.  I think this would be interesting to see, since I always thought that the ice cavern was just an excuse to have Jenny Agutter take her clothes off, which is more reason than most movies provide.  It also seems a bit farfetched for the prime computer to have a meltdown when Logan's information doesn't jive with its logic function.  But Peter Ustinov does a nice job here, even if he's going to have to be responsible for all these Eloi once their bio-dome breaks down, and I have to say that Ms. Agutter is a pleasure to watch, with or without her clothes.    There are several different packages of this film still available, and depending on your level of interest, this blu-ray edition may not be the best choice.  As far as picture and sound, the blu-ray is fine, but not remarkable.  I can't directly compare it to a regular edition DVD, but I suspect any good upconversion will be almost indistinguishable from the blu-ray.  The blu-ray also has a Spanish and German dubbed track along with English and French, and is presented in 2.40:1 aspect, whereas the regular edition DVD is in 2.20:1.  Also included is a short, silly making-of featurette, the theatrical trailer, and a commentary track by Michael York, director Michael Anderson, and costume designer Bill Thomas.  I probably enjoyed the commentary as much as the film, as I'm always curious about how these pictures are made, and the behind the scenes mini-documentaries rarely catch the subtle nuances that the commentaries do.  But in this blu-ray edition, along with the current regular DVD, two commentary tracks (one by York alone, and one with Anderson and Thomas) have been squeezed into one.  It's extremely doubtful that we're missing anything important, but for those who may care, there was a special edition released in 2004 thatcarries both commentary tracks.  And although [[ASIN:0792839692 this edition]] only carries the one, squeezed commentary track too, it does have an introductory essay by Michael Anderson and a booklet to boot.  Bonus!    The long and the short of it is that if you already own this movie in another format - unless it is your favorite film of all time - then I wouldn't bother upgrading.  If you don't have it and still want it, the blu-ray, as of this writing, is less expensive than the regular format, so that should be a no-brainer if you have blu-ray capability.  Overall, it's worth owning a copy to me - I imagine it will be a long time before I watch it again, but there will probably come a day when I'll need a dose of seventies science-fiction again, and this is one of the better pre-Star Wars examples out there.      3 1/2 stars, rounded down for younger viewers who are unlikely to be impressed.
B002VECMAE|2.0|Here in this review I may appear hypocritical in view of my other defense against other low rated movie reviews - but so be it. My hypocrisy rests in that I read the book first and found the movie coming up short. This is hypocrisy since I understand many movies fall short of expectation to views entering a view with book entrenched in the mind.<br /><br />The movie, for me, was even hard to watch. I felt as if it was made quickly, too quickly and although it was a comedy there were some issues presented in the book as serious issues, modern political issues, that should have been dealt with better. They were not.<br /><br />There were parts of the move that had me in stitches and would not advise against \\"ever\\" watching this movie - but I wouldn't stay home missing a brilliant event in exchange.<br /><br />Perhaps you are better off if you don't read the book first BUT if you want to enjoy what I felt was a better story - read the book.
B0034GK7DM|5.0|I bought this CD after listening to the Amazon sampler -- turned out to be a great buy! This guy really does sound like a young George Strait -- honest & true.  I recommend this CD to anybody.
B00004TRDH|5.0|This cd was exactly what I needed. Obviously used before but in great condition. I would buy from this seller again.
B0027CSNBM|5.0|this book is like a companion to the Percy Jackson books and a must have for better understanding. It is almost like a reference book!
B001TH8UUA|5.0|Nothing really fancy to report other than this cable is well constructed.  Excellent quality.  Hooked up and delivered flawless picture as described.
142311339X|5.0|I fell in love with the percy jackson books and when I saw this book I knew I had to read it. It is a continuation of the percy jackson books basically. The same thrilling encounters with monsters and suspense with alittle bit of a twist. It will make you beg for more
0061997811|5.0|I absolutely love this book. It is full of wonderful behind-the-scenes photos and information as well as interviews with production crew and cast members. There are even some wonderful 'props' that fill the book. If you are a Harry Potter fan, then this book is a must have.
B0032JTV6U|5.0|at first when glee came out I was little leery, afraid that they would break out in cheesy song and dance at any possible second. This is not the case at all. The show has amazing vocals and acting and it will make you want more, I guarantee. The characters are extremely likable and easy to related to especially if you have ever been in high school. Glee is by far one of the best shows on tv and if you haven't seen it yet take a few minutes out of your day and watch an episode, you will absolutely love it no matter how old or young you are.
B0041CGP02|3.0|Ok, I am a big Bon Jovi fan and will be seeing them in concert for the 4th time soon. I have to say that this GH album is crap to ignore the first two albums besides \\"Runaway\\" and that the Bounce album is left off too. Roulette, Shot Through the Heart, Get Ready, In & Out of Love, Only Lonely and Tokyo Road from the first two records should have been included in this \\"Ultimate\\" collection. Most of Bon Jovi's recent material is all political rock and it's so funny that the ticket prices contradict the meaning of some of there new songs. Jon Bon Jovi stated during one of the first shows off the Circle tour that they will be playing songs from the first two records live, but that only lasted a week. I own all the main albums so I recommend buying at least the first three, but the band essentially disowns 2/3 of that material. Just download the 4 new songs from this release for free somewhere on the internet and don't waste your hard earned money on the other hits you probably already have from the main albums.
B004BSAPRK|4.0|When \\"Only Girl In The World\\" dropped as the first single, I was anticipating a dance album much like \\"A Girl Like Me\\" and not continuing in the more melodic darker pop sound she found on \\"Rated R.\\" Much to my surprise, even though there is a strong underlying beat/rhythm to her songs--this album is so much more than just pop. Rihanna incorporates R&B, Rap, Caribbean, Rock and Enya (listen to \\"Fading\\"--it's there) to create an album that isn't really one specific genre. This is in my opinion both it's greatest strength as well as it's biggest weakness. This album most certainly won't bore you, but say if you only like Rihanna when she's singing more R&B/Rap songs style songs than you'll probably be disappointed with about half of the album. Also, on \\"Rated R\\" there was a specific sound that brought the whole album together, where this album just doesn't sound as cohesive and put together. Basically, it's not as consistently good as \\"Rated R.\\"<br /><br />However, that being said--this album rocks. I love that Rihanna is branching out into even more genres, and there is one constant--Rihanna's voice sounds phenomenal and is really showcased on tracks like \\"Complicated.\\" I was excited to see producers like Timbaland, David Guetta and Ne-Yo all on-board. Also--she sampled Avril Lavigne on \\"Cheers\\"-how could you not love that. Also, the Part II of \\"Love the Way You Lie\\" with Eminem is just sic. My favorite songs are actually the more rock influenced or more stripped down songs because I find these ones really suit Rihanna's voice quality best. \\"California King Bed\\", \\"Man Down\\" and \\"Complicated\\" are stand outs.<br /><br />I think this album was a necessary progression in Rihanna's musical evolution, and for the most part-she's spot on. I would definitely recommend this album. Listen to the sample tracks first though to see if you like variety of genres because if you expect them all to sound like \\"Only Girl In the World\\" or even the second single with Drake \\"What's My Name\\", then you'll be really dissapointed. If you keep an open mind though-I think you'll find you will love the majority at least of this album.l be really dissapointed. If you keep an open mind though-I think you'll find you will love the majority at least of this album.
B00447G2MK|5.0|I'm a huge ADTR fan, my itunes play counts for every song exceed 20. When Jeremy helped produce the Veara album and then ADTR came out with the christmas single Right Where you Want Me to Be, I sensed a change towards a more pop punk sound, and trust me, it works perfectly in this album.    Sticks and Bricks: 8/10. Solid song with a good breakdown and chorus, but not much sets it apart.  All I want: 6/10. Catchy and decent, but not the typical pop-punk or hardcore punch you expect.  Its Complicated: 9/10. Amazing breakdown in the middle, and great chorus.  This is the House That Doubt Built: 10/10. Such a powerful song, amazing chorus. Bone chilling to listen to.  2nd Sucks: 9/10. Greatest breakdown of all-time for ADTR in my opinion, the rest of the song is solid.  Better Off This Way: 10/10. One of all-time favorites. Very catchy.  All Signs Point to Lauderdale: 8/10. Solid, but a little bland and repetitive.  You Be Tails, I'll be Sonic: 8/10. Sounds pretty similar to Sticks and Bricks. Decent breakdown, just not much special.  Out Of Time: 7/10. Similar tone to All I want, but I like the melodic development better here.  If I Leave: 9/10. Can't get this song out of my head. Great way to end the album.    I've seen ADTR live twice this calendar year, and can't wait to see them play these songs live. Many people will accuse them of selling out, but honestly, I don't care because the music is still amazing. And when it comes to music, whatever works and makes a good product, simply, works.
0788812408|1.0|I PLACED THIS ORDER ABOUT A MONTH AGO AND HAVENT RECEIVED IT YET.. I'M NOT TOO MAD ABOUT IT HOWEVER BECAUSE WHEN I PURCHASED IT I THOUGHT IT WAS A DVD.. COME TO FIND OUT IT WAS A VHS?? WHO CARES. BUT I BELIEVE THAT I SHOULD OF RECEIVED IT ANYWAY BECAUSE I DID PAY FOR IT.
0553805371|4.0|When giving my overall opinion of the \\"Grand design\\" I suppose I should start off by commenting on the length of the book. The book was entirely too short and therefore, I was able to get through it much too quickly. I spend much of my free time perusing through various types of physics reading material, but unfortunately most of what was written in the book were things I was already quite well-versed in. I wish they had gone into greater detail when discussing certain things (like the slit experiment, and the poor example they gave using soccer balls). The details of the String theory would not be descriptive or comprehensive enough to a layman There is very little depth to their explanations, such as 'why their needs to be 10 dimensions'. (On the other hand, this allows all readers to see the bigger picture while reading, and any further examination regarding specific topics can be found on the internet)<br /><br />However though, no book is perfect. I truly believe Stephen Hawking was trying to do something different. Something which no other physics book had done before. He talked about everything (from the big bang to every subsequent natural event), noting that all of it can be described through natural processes. He valiantly attempts to remove mysticism and supernatural explanation. The content of the book is precise and correct, but a little toned down for a wider audience.<br /><br />Overall, I really liked what the book represents, and the reactions it has brought about (from the viewpoints of novices to the experts)
B003YWUTJI|3.0|As much as I love Norah Jones, I felt that this CD was a bit sleepy.  Everything was so mellow, it almost all just blended together.  There should have been some new and fresh collaborations to mix it up a bit.  Although there are a ton of different genres mixed up, there still is not an upbeat or lively song on the CD.  That being said, since I love Outkast and Ryan Adams, \\"Take off your cool\\" and \\"Dear John\\" are my favorite. This CD would be great for background music at a dinner party.
B003EYVXXW|4.0|Purchased on a whim because I like Rachel Weisz's work, I was not disappointed.  This movie did not get much hype as far as I can tell as I hadn't heard of it before I saw it on Amazon's enticement list.  This is not an action film by any means, but it does highlight a very important era in history, especially in women's history.  Hypatia, female--the worst thing to be in that world at that time, had an indulgent father who educated her.  She led a free life, did not marry and thus was not protected.  She was a wise woman in a time when women did not exist but to bear young but her freedom disturbed the male society, and her religious inclinations, if they were anything, were based in the pagan religion at a time when Christianity was struggling against the pagan world to gain power and hegemony.  Too often the Christians were led by zealots and, of course, early Christians, much like too many religions today, are not wonderfully happy when a woman shows strength, courage, and exercizes power.  Hypatia's power was of the mind.  She had no political inclinations but she knew powerful people.  Every era has its own form of inquisition.  This one was no exception. I appreciated this film.
B00065EB2M|5.0|Great video coverage of the last mission to the moon.
B000YRY8BG|5.0|I saw Kevin MacDonald's film of \\"State of Play\\" before I saw the BBC miniseries on which it was based. The movie is very good, but the miniseries--with its more clearly delineated characters and its greater sense of tragedy--has to be one of the best television shows I have ever seen. Paul Abbott's writing is a marvel, combining an intricate yet coherent plot with dazzling dialogue. The acting is also first-rate; I had never seen the show's stars, John Simm and David Morrissey, in anything before, but I certainly hope to do so again. The supporting cast, meanwhile, is stuffed with many of my British Rep favorites--Bill Nighy, Kelly Macdonald, James McAvoy, Polly Walker--and they are as wonderful as ever. This version of \\"State of Play\\" is not only superior to the movie, but in my opinion stands with \\"All the President's Men\\" and \\"Nothing But the Truth\\" as the best screen delineation ever of the uneasy relationship between journalism and politics.
1847245455|5.0|I enjoyed this book. I usually read mystery books and this was a chance to read something different. Very good author .
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|I adore everything Loreena McKennitt has ever recorded and I honestly think this is her best yet. It's simpler, quieter and her voice remains that of an angel. Simply spectacular!
B00004CYVZ|1.0|I feel that people selling these items should inform people especially novice people about regions.  My item was not able to be played and had to be returned for a credit.  Was not impredded at all
0767821769|1.0|I didnot like this movie. I thought it would be good because Julia Roberts were in it. (WRONG). It was just as boring as it could be. Watch Pretty Woman for a outstanding Julia Roberts performance.
B003Y8YXGM|5.0|I was in awe with the wonderfully re-mastered edition of John Lennon's \\"Walls and Bridges\\" album.<br />A careful work of restauration and a marvellous sound.<br />Congratulations for the great job.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|** 2.5 stars ** I've read through many of the glowing reviews and I don't like to knock anyone for such a subjective subject as music, but I feel the need to point out that the emperor has no clothes and it isn't just that it's a different style, it's that it's very disappointing. It isn't one I pop in often or with excitement when I want to hear the three or four songs I like.  A few of the songs could have easily been on a Foster produced CD and been fine but not all together on one CD. One particular song stands out but as the one I intensely dislike which I won't name so people can form their own opinions but I've read other reviews that didn't like it, either. It tortures me to say it but some lyrics just aren't good. Overall, some songs I like but none I can say I love. Whereas David Foster tended towards overproduction and overkill, Rick Rubin has the exact opposite problem, not enough input. This all being said, it's still Josh Groban singing and that's a far sight better than some of the stuff that's passed off as singing these days. Sorry, Josh.
B003IWZ1D8|5.0|I recently purchased the blu-ray edition of this fabulous movie. The print is so crisp and clean. It was a true pleasure to view this movie with all the fine detail that comes with blu-ray. A great movie and one of the best blu-ray editions I have seen.
B00127RAJY|5.0|I love this disk. Three different levels of workouts means you can shuffle through and keep the same muscles from dying day after day. You will FEEL the difference immediately. I saw a difference (and so did my husband) after just 3 days. My only complaint, or perhaps suggestion for Jillian, would be that your body really needs more warm up and cool down. Do yourself a favor, warm-up for about 5-10 minutes and THEN do the workout. Afterwards, give yourself a longer stretch period. Maybe pause it during each stretch or hit the back button or just stretch on your own. Overall this is a fantastic dvd and I highly recommend it. Definitely start with level one. These workouts are intense. Keep with it, though, and you'll love what happens.
B000I0QM0E|4.0|I recently purchased the blu ray edition of this movie. I already owned this movie on DVD and the upgrade was worth the money. I always look for the fine details in a blu ray, and I was not let down. This is a very fine movie, made better by the upgrade to blu ray.
B001CEE1YE|4.0|It could be an extended version but this is what we got, then it is perfect.  Perfect sound and HD quality in BD, a must product to who is fanatic for The Matrix.
B000H5U832|5.0|A super movie. I ordered it for my great grandson and it came fast and perfect.<br />Always great service!
B000SEIKIW|5.0|Since picking up Briefer History of Time, I have found myself wishing that I had a physics teacher in high school who was just a fraction of the teacher Stephen Hawking must be.  As someone who has in the past had no interest in the sciences, this book has aroused my curiosity in a way I never thought would be possible.  I'm already planning to read Hawking's Grand Design and Brian Green's Elegant Universe immediately after this.  I now fully regret not taking more science courses in college!
B003YWUTKM|5.0|I'm more into Pink-Floyd than The Orb.<br /><br />For me Metallic Spheres is one big track (48+ minutes) with very original music in an Ambient-Minimalist fashion like Mike Oldfield used to do (Amarok). Open spaces, lots of background effects, great rhythms, and, of course, David Gilmour guitars!. Every time I listen to it I find new passages and sounds. Some passages reminds me other artists like Passport, Enigma, Jerome Froese, and many more. I like it and it was a great deal (less than 10 USD).<br /><br />Hats off to The Orb and David Gilmour.<br /><br />Eduardo. Mexico City.
B0041T52S6|2.0|This movie, for all it's attempts to be trendy, flashy, fresh and fun, was a disappointment because of Micheal Cera and his uninspired and unlikeable character of Scott Pilgrim. I don't want this guy to get the girl, or any girl, or anything. I want the League of Evil Exes to crush him. I want to see him badly broken and working in a McDonald's to make ends meet, lamenting on his wasted youth. He's terrible. The special effects, the amazing and very entertaining supportive cast and the quirky humor saved his from being a one star, but with the main character of the movie being so unlikeable I couldn't get past a two star. It's worth watching, but I found myself just wanting to know more about everyone except Scott Pilgrim.
B0020BUWX2|5.0|If you only ever read one book in your whole life, this had better be it. It will move you to tears, and then make you laugh so hard you might actually cry ( although that might just be me). And when you do read this book, I'll be right there to say I told you so.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|As a long time LK fan I had no idea this CD was coming out. This release evokes memories of her earlier commercial works when Loreena was mainly a Celtic artist. Over the years she evolved her music into a more worldly, more unique sound. Her \\"ancient muse\\" cd was a perfect example of that, having elements of many cultures but yet very much an original sound on it's own.    The Wind that Shakes the Barley contains 9 beautiful celtic pieces. It seemed odd to be listening to Loreena performing just celtic pieces again, and I wondered if this were a cd of unreleased tracks maybe? I don't know. I found it perfectly produced and her voice is as clear and strong as ever.  If anything, I found it too short and immediately put it on again for a re-listen.    If you are a fan of her earlier work, this is a fantastic album in that vein. Even tho I much prefer her newer, more \\"worldly\\" sound, I still enjoyed this immensely. She is an artist who clearly labors over each song and each album and that come through so strongly in a release such as this.    Edit: I am also surprised there seems to be no MP3 / digital version for sale. I sent a link to a friend to buy and we could not find a digital version for sale here on Amazon or via another service. Odd. Maybe it is forthcoming.
B0021L8V1Q|4.0|Very good follow up to the first. Robert Downey Jr. is again a perfect match for the role. I very much missed Terrence Howard. It had a good story line and great special effects. It you liked the first one this is a must see.
B001OQCV2E|5.0|2012 is THE Greatest Disaster Movie yet made and I think it will never be topped. This fantastic movie has everything: Earthquakes, sinking ships, volcanic eruptions, car crashes, capsizing ships, tidal waves, collapsing buildings - EVERYTHING!! (except killer bees --- and \\"The Swarm\\" was pretty lame.) All the best disasters rolled into one wonderful and fun ride. The only sad thing about the DVD is that 2012 was truly a big screen movie. To be in the theater and see all the detail as buildings tumble, people run screaming this way and that, explosions all about the screen, and especially the awesome sound as windows shatter and the earthquake rumbles in your chest. WOW! If you have a home theater perhaps you can capture that same awesome feeling.    Many viewers and critics complain about the plot, which I think is silly. You don't go to a disaster movie expecting Academy Award drama, just like you don't expect that in any number of genres: Horror and Action for example. And though I did find the plot a bit goofy at times, I found the characters extrememly likeable and often very realistic. John Cusack was great as a normal joe, a loser to be blunt, trying to save his family. Amanda Peet was a good mom. Woody Harrelson was superb as a crazy conspiracy theorist who knew the disaster was coming. Dannie Glover was a good president.  Chiwetel Ejiofor and Oliver Platt were wonderful as a Good Cop and Bad Cop for the Feds, arguing about who to save, what to save, cover ups, and all kinds of cool stuff. And my absolute favorite was young Morgan Lily, Cusack's and Peet's daughter, a very observant young girl.     The special effects are the main treat but I thought 2012 also touched on some wonderful thought provoking ideas such as what do you save when all of civilization is in peril? Whom do you save?     Another fun thing is some great GREAT lines. When faced with the thought of desperate measures and sacrifices made to save a portion of mankind, Platt says \\"What did you think? We're all just gonna get onboard, hold hands and sing \\"Kumbaya\\"? Sit down and buckle up.\\"  -When fleeing The Largest Explosion Ever Put To Film, Cusack tries to comfort his daughter. \\"Do I look scared?\\" She nods \\"Uh-huh!\\"   -Then, near the climax, Platt again: \\"Something went wrong? SOMETHING WRONG? Are you kidding me? Of course something went wrong!!!\\"  -Ah me, great writing.    If you see one movie before the world ends, 2012 is THE movie to see!
0439023513|5.0|I really enjoyed reading this.  I thought the ending was very true to the books and the characters.  Wonderful series!
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|Huge disappointment... when ever I saw the TRAILER I was so excited about it... Steven Spielberg and Hanks!! a new Band of Brothers! Sounded great....    The story is pointless, beyond showing the atrocities of war but it  has no soul, and during the whole series you get no one to relate with or to identify you with...    In Band of Brothers you were able to actually follow your favorite character and to relate with them when ever a brother fell you could actually feel sorry...    here, there is no brotherhood... they are all just numbers. If the kid from Jurassic Park dies I couldn't care less... Before, I was hoping and crossing my fingers to see  Winters Malarky and LUZ make it through the war!!    The Pacific brings lots of blood but no soul. and the first 4 episodes BORING AS a fkn Clam!!    Sure... it is a nice metal box which belongs to every war collection... but I saw it once and to be honest I won't be seeing it again.    Band of Brothers and Ryan, i watch those once a year since I got my metal box a long time ago and the one that looks like a bullet case (Ryan)    EY!!!  How great would have been in Band of Brothers to see Hanks dressed as Cpt. Miller or any one other of the guys?... asking Winters just for a couple of seconds... \\"Do you have a Private Ryan on your outfit?\\" Ryan was an Airborne!! no?     and then  a simple \\"NO\\" from Winters or Compton... or even Lipton... and then Hanks just turning around and carrying on...    Would have been LEGENDARY!!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh Groban is perhaps one of today's greatest influences in modern classical music (or classical crossover). He is highly musical and experimental, which I appreciate in any artist from any genre. His rich baritone voice envelopes you completely and even if the songs weren't incredible (which for the most part they are), his voice alone would be worth listening to. The likes of Paul Potts and Il Divo can't hope to compete.     He made a name for himself after he broke onto the scene at the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City where he performed \\"The Prayer\\" with Charlotte Church. His debut album was a huge success and his second album \\"Closer\\" contained the masterpieces \\"You Raise Me Up\\" and \\"Remember When It Rained\\" among others. 2005's \\"Awake\\" saw Josh beginning some experimentation into different musical styles. He enlisted the creative help of some of greatest musical talents, including Imogen Heap, Herbie Hancock, Five for Fighting's John Ondrasik. His Christmas album \\"Noel\\", released in 2008, went on to become one of the best-selling albums of both 2008 and 2009.    Illuminations is his much-anticipated fifth studio album and, as is his custom, Josh gives us a new sound that is distinctly Groban, but unlike anything we've heard from him before. I would describe it as classical singer-songwriter. There are tracks that are beautifully orchestrated (no surprise since some of it is done by James Newton-Howard). But then there are simple acoustic tracks with piano, mandolin, acoustic guitar, and some strings. No drums. That's right. Only one or two tracks feature drums, and even then they are not drum sets, but orchestral drums. Josh wanted to give us music that would be fitting in Carnegie Hall but also give us the intimacy of a club. Even though it might not be brimming with energy and creativity, the result is perhaps Josh's most musical and talented work to date.    I bought the deluxe edition from iTunes which comes with the original 13 tracks, one bonus track, a music video, and an interactive digital pamphlet in which Josh offers commentary on each of the tracks. So I might grab a few quotes from him while telling you about the individual songs.    1. The Wandering Kind (Prelude)- This is a purely instrumental song written by Josh when he was twelve or thirteen that he's been playing his whole life but never recorded. According to him, lyrics were attempted but it just didn't seem to work, so it was just recorded as an instrumental with Josh on piano accompanied by ukelele, accordion, guitar, and strings. It has almost a Celtic feel to it and, even though it is unconventional Groban, serves as a great intro to the album.    2. Bells of New York City- Josh is completely in love with NYC and this song serves as sort of his love song to it. To him, the music reminds him of the city and its people. The piano creates a bell-like sound as Josh is supported by a Carnegie-worthy orchestra. .     3. Galileo (Someone Like You)- This is a love song seen from the eyes of a scientist. According to Josh, it shows you a man who is \\"experiencing something so grand in a very simple way\\". Musically, it sounds like something you would hear on Broadway.     4. L'ora Dell'Addio- Perhaps the most classical-sounding track of the album, this is something you would hear in a huge concert hall. It is very grand and sweeping and Josh's vocal performance is flawless.     5. Hidden Away- This is the album's first single. It has a beautiful melody and is gorgeously and simply executed. It's about not keeping your love to yourself and letting letting your light shine, so to speak. One of my personal favorites of the album.    6. Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourqouis- A beautiful French track. Again, it is grand and sweeping, but in a more romantic and sensitive way.     7. Higher Window- This is my favorite track of the album. It is very emotional and very well-written. It is about a relationship that is sinking but not beyond hope. The arrangement is brilliant. Every time I hear it I'm in awe of its perfection. If you don't listen to any other track, please check this one.    8. If I Walk Away- This song is not brilliant, but not altogether forgettable. A great vocal performance from Josh, this track employs interesting arrangement choices, including a gospel choir, hammer dulcimer, and, as always, beautiful orchestration.    9. Love Only Knows- A raw, intimate song about whether a relationship is meant to continue, at times it is incredibly poetic and insightful, but at times it lacks in both flow and creativity with the songwriting and arrangement. Not one of my favorites, but Josh does a fine job.    10. Voce Existe Em Mim- Josh experiments with a totally new sound for him: Portugese lyrics and a heavy dose of Brazillian tribal drums. The result is mind-blowing. Definitely my favorite foreign language track. It is packed with energy and adventure that is so refreshing after the beautiful, but slow songs that precede it on the album.    11. War at Home- This song was inspired by Josh's visit to Walter Reed Hospital where he met children who were injured or disabled from war. He was very moved by the experienced that he immediately blogged about it and consequently wrote the lyrics to this song. The melody is perhaps one of the best on the album. I can see it being a good singer-songwriter song for a solo acoustic guitar, but the orchestral arrangement, especially the choir, is very effective.    12. London Hymn- A short choral piece composed by Josh and Marius de Vries (collaborated on Remember When It Rained and Machine) while in a hotel in London, this is a step into uncharted territory for Josh. While some might not be especially impressed with the opera choir, I give him credit for trying something new. At just under two minutes, it's the shortest track of the album.    13. Straight to You- A song written and originally recorded by Nick Cave, this is perhaps the most beautiful moment on the album. The lyricshave such a simple poetry which works beautifully with the music. James Newton-Howard does the orchestration and you feel if Josh's voice were taken out, this would belong to the most emotional scene of a film. I don't think I've ever anything by Josh that is as beautiful as this. It could make you cry from sheer exposure to such beauty.    14. Feels Like Home (Bonus Track from Deluxe Edition)- If you bought the regular album, you'll want to go to iTunes and download this song. Yes, it is the same song you heard in the film \\"My Sister's Keeper\\". Originally written by Randy Newman and newly arranged and orchestrated by James Newton-Howard, this version is brilliantly crafted to flawlessly combine Josh's rich voice and intimate instrumentation. The lyrics are melancholy and bittersweet. Simply a stroke of genius.    On the Deluxe iTunes version is also the music video for Hidden Away (Radio Edit). The video itself is not extraordinary, but I really like the Radio Edit of the song. It's tastefully done and takes the song from a simple and intimate sound to a more mainstream sound which works very well. I hope it will be released as a single soon.    Overall, I'm very surprised and delighted at the turn Josh has taken. He knows he's very musical and his fan base is largely accepting of classical music so he created a new sound. Some might call it playing it safe instead of branching more into the pop genre, but the industry is filled with that. I think Josh was daring in pursuing a simpler, intimate style and I think he really pulled it off brilliantly. It might not have been what I was expecting or even hoping for, but I give props to Josh for expanding his musical horizons. I do feel as far as musicality goes, while the arrangement is usually simple, the melodies and harmonies are the most complex and creative he's put out. Josh had his writing hand in most of these songs and I think it goes to prove that Josh is no longer the young vocalist performing covers or songsothers have written for him. While still one of the world's greatest vocalists first and foremost, Josh has now evolved into a true artist of music.
B00006CXSS|5.0|EY!!!  How great would have been in Band of Brothers to see Hanks dressed as Cpt. Miller or any one other of the guys?... asking Winters, just for a couple of seconds...     \\"Do you have a Private Ryan on your outfit?\\"     Ryan was an Airborne!! no?     and then  a simple \\"NO\\" from Winters or Compton... or even Lipton... and then Hanks just turning around and carrying on...    Would have been LEGENDARY!!
B001PU8N0I|5.0|We purchased this after seeing the miniseries on PBS....Masterpiece Theatre. This is based on Dickens' book of the same title and is one of the best TV adaptations I've seen. You will not be disappointed.
B002L5GQGY|5.0|This guy really rocks. Before I happen to come across this DVD on TV I had never heard of the dude. The stuff he lays down is awesome, and being a bass player myself he could dial me up for a show or tour for that matter, and I would do it just for shear joy of playing with someone like this solid proforma.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|THE PROMISE is a 2-CD set consisting of unreleased songs from the sessions for DARKNESS ON THE EDGE OF TOWN, and the result is a collection that is just as good, and sometimes better, than that masterpiece in its own right. Almost every song here is a winner, including songs originally released by other artists. To hear Springsteen's original versions is nothing short of a revelation. This is an album that both true fans and novices alike will treasure for years.
B003UBTX7C|3.0|I was looking forward to this installment for a long time, and I'm a bit disappointed. A pretty good read, but near the bottom of my Baldacci list, and certainly the worst of the Camel Club series. I feel like this story could have used some more time to marinate. It felt rushed in terms of sustance. I'd much rather see what's next in the King series, or a continuation of True Blue.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|It's not going to be the mega hit CD like Rock n' Roll Jesus was, but very good in it's own right.  Good mix of rock and roll, blues, country & ballads.  Would have liked more like \\"God Bless Saturday\\" or even more rock.  Well worth the purchase.
1401309666|4.0|The Long Tail: Why the Future Is Selling Less of More                                                                                                                   Vincent    I was always wondering the question that what made Amazon and Ebay become the multinational corporations when I was an undergraduate student in China. After reading The Long Tail, I found the answer to my question. Firstly, I want to give a brief introduction to the theory \\"long tail\\" by citing a paragraph on author's blog: \\"The theory of the long tail is that our culture and economy is increasingly shifting away from a focus on a relatively small number of \\"hits\\" (mainstream products and markets) at the head of the demand curve and toward a huge number of niches in the tail. As the costs of production and distribution fall, especially online, there is now less need to lump products and consumers into one-size-fits-all containers. In an era without the constraints of physical shelf space and other bottlenecks of distribution, narrowly-targeted goods and services can be as economically attractive as mainstream fare.\\" By understanding the meaning behind this paragraph, which is not difficult, we could get a clear first impression on this topic. In his book, author thinks there are three forces of the long tail: democratization of the tools of production; minimization of the costs of distribution; the connection of consumers to one another. Knowing the forces is not enough, at the end of this book, author gives us two keys for using \\"long tail\\" theory well: 1 Make everything available. 2 Help me find it.  However, author doesn't detail them, which make audiences have to think about it by themselves.    Case study: digital music in China   In China, we cannot use the \\"long tail\\" theory in order to make digital music industry successful. Why? Probably you will ask me this question. First, let's focus on the differences between Internet users in USA and in China. In USA, almost every person can use Internet and many people like using it to purchase digital music. However, the situation in China is totally different: most Internet users' age range from 15 to 35 in China. This means many songs that attract mid-aged or children will be neglected and seldom downloaded. What is more, more than 80% of Chinese citizens live in the country area. Currently, China is still a developing nation and people who live in many country areas cannot get access to Internet. How can people purchase digital music if they cannot have access to Internet? We know this is impossible. E-business is becoming more and more popular in these years in China. Yet, E-business corporations in China don't have that large user base as corporations in USA (like iTunes, Amazon). Due to this disadvantage, digital music companies in China are not able to cause that \\"long tail\\" so they cannot make use of it either. Finally, piracy is common in China: people can get free pirate music easily. People won't pay money to buy songs via iTunes.     I am pretty sure we will use \\"long tail\\" theory to make digital music industry successful in China one day.  However, right now, we have to use the \\"80/20\\" theory to make digital music industry gain money.

1442337966|5.0|I purchased The Power on CD as soon as it was out. I am a big fan of The Secret and this is the follow-up to that. The first part of The Power is The Secret's ideas and information so that if you haven't read it you are up to speed. I had no problem with that since it helps to be reminded as much as possible about the law of attraction. The second part of the book really gives you a wake up call as to how you think, what thoughts you let float around in your head and how to focus those thoughts to bring good feelings and good things into your life. I found it to be very enlightening. I purchased the CD version because I like to hear the words spoken. I play it in my car almost constantly. I remember the ideas better that way and the author Rhonda Byrne has a very soothing voice. I tell everyone I know about The Secret and The Power. I tell them -even if you don't think there is anything to these ideas that it is a wonderful way to live. I will imagine a life where everyone has heard Rhonda's message - thoughts become things!
B0036EH3U2|5.0|I have already watched the series, but as a collector, I want to have all my favorite series in Blu-ray. And Battlestar Galactica: The Complete Series didn't let me down. Although the packaging is a little too fragile, I think it will endure as long as you don't lend it. The content itself is great: all the seasons, including Razor and The Plan, all with great quality of audio and video in high definition. I didn't owned previous versions, so I can't compare extras. I enjoyed the extras from this box, though: for every single episode there is a commentary track, lots of deleted scenes, interviews and so on.    I'd recommend this box for any fan of BSG!
B003UZ46DY|5.0|Frontman of Incubus Brandon Boyd does it on his own with an incredible acoustic album. Every song on this album is good. Even if your not an incubus fan I would recommend this album. Its very versatile in its sound and doesn't get old. A must buy for some feel good music.
B003YP7N9O|4.0|After the fantastic special edition re-issue of 'This Was' I was hoping for a similar treatment for the superior 'Stand Up'. The selling points for this edition are, clearly, the first release (at long last) of the full 6 minute version of '17' on CD - Anderson may hate it, but many fans (myself included) love it,even if it was only ever mixed in mono - and the June '69 BBC sessions. However, apart from the fact that it was released a year too late (41st anniversary ??) there are a few aspects that prevent me from giving it 5 stars. Firstly, I'm pretty sure that 'Living In The Past' was also recorded as part of the same BBC session (I have it on a bootleg) and Greg Russo claims in his excellent 'Flying Colours' that 'Sweet Dream' and 'The Witch's Promise' were recorded. (Is there any evidence of this?). Secondly, the choice of live material to accompany the studio tracks is rather bizarre. Surely we should have been treated to a 1969 live set by the same line-up that recorded the album - the full evening set from Stockholm (Jan.9th) for example, or something from the 1969 US tours - instead of a late 1970 concert (with a 5 piece line-up) that has already been released. This would have been much more appropriate for the 'Benefit' special edition (if there is to be one) as it features the 'Benefit' line-up. Oh well, maybe they're saving the 7/7/70 Tanglewood set for that one. We can only hope...
B004259BMM|4.0|The only reason this album doesn't get 5 stars is simply because there are 8 tracks.  However, it's still definitely worth the money, and would be even if it was only 5 songs.  I've seen Keith in concert twice now and he's by far the best performer I've seen.  Hopefully this new album brings another tour!
B003AJKPL2|4.0|Bought this for my brother and he absolutly loved it. He thought it was so great he even brought it over with him for the holidays with some cherry's. Would recommend pitting over a bowl or paper town though as the pit some juice can splash out the bottom if you are an overzelous user. Only reason I gave it 4 stars opposed to 5 is was b/c it was a present and I didn't actaully get to use to often and write any thing more indepth about it.
B004B4J7H8|5.0|I have been a great fan of Alexandre Desplat's film scores over the years, particularly those he composed for \\"Birth,\\" \\"The Painted Veil,\\" \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"Mr. Magorium's Magic Emporium\\" (co-written with Aaron Zigman).  They are all unique to the films for which they were written, and all expressive of a man who (like his \\"Harry Potter\\" predecessor, John Williams) has the heart and soul of a symphonic composer, one whose outlet happens to be the movie theater rather than the concert hall.  As someone mildly obsessed with all things HP, I was elated to hear that he had been chosen to write the score for \\"Deathly Hallows.\\"  Hearing the finished product, I can only say that, miraculously, Desplat has outdone himself.<br /><br />There hasn't been this rich and melodic a score for a Harry Potter film since \\"Prisoner of Azkaban\\"; honestly, it's been a long time since I've heard a film score this successful, period.  It is remarkable what Desplat has achieved here, how perfectly he creates mood via musical texture, whether it be a lone piano, a swell of cellos, a distant choir or a somber, solo french horn.  This is a man who not only knows how to compose, but, perhaps more importantly, how to orchestrate.  (For the record, he is one of several on the film.)<br /><br />I particularly love how the opening track sneaks up on us, and the gorgeous, sweeping melody that follows; the whimsy of \\"Polyjuice Potion\\"; the sly, insidious evil of \\"The Locket\\"; the heartbreak and anguish of \\"Ron Leaves\\"; the palpable regret of \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\"; the emotional arc of \\"Hermione's Parents\\"; the heroics of \\"Destroying the Locket\\"; the eeriness of \\"The Deathly Hallows;\\" the pathos and nobility of \\"Farewell to Dobby.\\"  And I'm impressed with how often Desplat makes use of \\"Hedwig's Theme,\\" both literally and in variation; it shows a genuine respect for the series' musical heritage.<br /><br />I do wish that Desplat, in his theme for Dobby, had alluded to the charming one already established by Williams in the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" score.  And \\"Lovegood\\" is hardly the idiosyncratic and eccentric representation I would expect for that character.  (The significance of the pan pipe escapes me.)  Also, now and again (particularly in \\"Fireplace Escape\\" and \\"Captured and Tortured\\"), the music suffers from the typical pulsing monotony and punctuating brass that seems almost \\"de rigeur\\" when scoring action sequences these days.  And from a producing point of view, the album itself ends rather anti-climatically, devoid of an end credit sequence.  (Let's hope the film itself doesn't suffer similarly.)  But these are insignificant quibbles.<br /><br />This score is nothing short of a testament to Alexandre Desplat's genius, and it's a delight to read in the liner notes that director David Yates has asked him to return for \\"Deathly Hallows, Part II.\\"Williams in the \\"Chamber of Secrets\\" score.

I find it hard to believe that any publisher with a lick of sense would pre-pay someone to write this pathetic dribble.  My cat could do a better job with a story.  What is really sad is that this garbage has such a big appeal to the stupid, needy white women that watch Oprah.

B003YWUTJI|3.0|Norah Jones' new album, ...Featuring, is a compilation album featuring cameos, duets, and collaborations with artists across a vast array of music genre.  The recording of these songs span the decade from 2001 to 2010 and show the wide range of Norah Jones' vocal talent.    As with pretty much any compilation album, I didn't care for all of the songs just because they weren't my preferred style of music. That being said, I was extremely impressed that Norah Jones sounded great on every song, all 18 songs, no matter what style of music she was singing or with whom she was singing. There aren't very many music artists who can accomplish that feat.    One of my favorite songs on the album was Norah Jones' duet with Willie Nelson. They sang \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\" and sounded great together.  She has a beautiful, unique voice that sounds excellent with many different artists.    You can see the range of artists with this song list:       1. Love Me - The Little Willies     2. Virginia Moon - The Foo Fighters featuring Norah Jones     3. Turn Them - Sean Bones featuring Norah Jones     4. Baby It's Cold Outside - Willie Nelson featuring Norah Jones     5. Bull Rider - Norah Jones and Sasha Dobson     6. Ruler Of My Heart - Dirty Dozen Brass Band featuring Norah Jones     7. The Best Part - El Madmo     8. Take Off Your Cool - OutKast featuring Norah Jones     9. Life Is Better - Q-Tip featuring Norah Jones    10. Soon The New Day - Talib Kweli featuring Norah Jones    11. Little Lou, Prophet Jack, Ugly John - Belle & Sebastian featuring Norah Jones    12. Here We Go Again - Ray Charles featuring Norah Jones    13. Loretta - Norah Jones featuring Gillian Welch and David Rawlings    14. Dear John - Ryan Adams featuring Norah Jones    15. Creepin' In - Norah Jones featuring Dolly Parton    16. Court & Spark - Herbie Hancock featuring Norah Jones    17. More Than This - Charlie Hunter featuring Norah Jones    18. Blue Bayou - Norah Jones featuring M. Ward    I received a copy of ...Featuring from the One2One network as part of the Norah Jones album project to facilitate the writing of a frank and honest review. All opinions are my own.

B003YWUTJI|4.0|I've enjoyed Norah Jones' music in the past, but I never would have described myself as a huge fan.  However, when I received this CD as part of a review panel, I was impressed at how true she stays to herself, but how broad her range truly is.  She performs different styles effortlessly (and her guest artists do the same).  The first time I listened to it, I wasn't sure how much I really cared for it, but I gave it a second chance and I'm glad I did, because now I'm a huge fan!  Besides, you can't really go wrong with big artists like Willie Nelson and Ray Charles - captivating!

B004BLJQOK|4.0|When I first heard that there was going to be an American remake of \\"Let The Right One In\\" I was skeptical. There had only been maybe a year or two since the original came out and Hollywood often ruins many of the remakes of foreign films they do (most of the asian horror ones except for maybe \\"The Ring\\"). What at first looked like a cheap attempt to cash-in from the success of the original actually turns out to be a good and faithful adaption of the Swedish film and the novel of the same name. The lead actors Kodi Smit-McPhee(The Road)and Chloe Moretz(Kick-Ass) both give good well-acted performances as the characters of the boy Owen and the vampire girl Abby. The film is essentially the same storyline as the original and comes close to a shot by shot remake however making it work (Unlike the remake of \\"Psycho\\"). This film offers superb cinematography as well as a well thought out script and music score. The only real weakness Let Me In has is the use of cgi during scenes where Abby is attacking her victims. These scenes come across as fake and laughable and were done better in the original film. Overall this is a faithful remake that lives up to the original and is one of the best theatrical horror films to come out this year.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I just dont understand why Josh Groban has to depart to what really defined his music.  He does have a few songs that resonate the previous 'GOOD' stuff that is Grobanmusic of grandeur standard... but this album is really disappointing overall. Probably you will be better of just downloading some selections to get the Groban fix you need...    It just sounds like his voice was being pushed too much and sorry Josh but some songs sounds too nasal to me.

B004BC7MRM|1.0|I heard Kid Rock sing the title track to this new record on the Country Music Awards the other night. Gotta tell ya, it was painful. For starters, he can't sing. He just screams. And his new song, \\"Born Free,\\" sounds like a bad Springsteen cover that doesn't use all the lyrics. The song makes no sense, lyrically, and goes absolutely nowhere musically. I mean, watching and listening to him on the CMA was downright unpleasant. At one point, it appeared that he had forgotten the lyrics or gotten lost in the arrangement. The song just sorta hung there in the wind, like nobody knew what was next. So KR just started yelling, \\"Born Free!\\" again, and the trainwreck was mercifully avoided. Hey, I like American Rock music, and Country Rock as well, but this guy is just plain awful.

0316098337|5.0|ROOM is a brilliant piece of writing from Emma Donoghue, that captures the wonderful freshness of childhood and the terrible evil that the world presents us with in a single voice. Jack and Ma are strikingly original characters; their voices will stay with you long after you have finished this compelling story. Another Booker short-listed work better than the winner.

B004132HZS|5.0|Having been a keen fan of Jeremy Britt's 1980s portrayal of Sherlock Holmes in the Granada Television presentation, I too was rather reluctant to purchase this \\"modern adaptation\\" of the Conan Doyle's Sherlock Holmes detective stories.  However, after reading so many glowing reviews on this board, I relented and purchased the BBC'S Season one of \\"Sherlock\\" and I am so very glad that I did make the purchase of this wonderful season.    This BBC presentation has the audience viewing modern-day London that is, of course, filled with texting on held hand cell phones, computers and void of horse-drawn carriages, long skirts along with Holmes' hats, etc., but with a very young looking up-to-date Sherlock Homes type character living in the same flat that the original Sherlock Holmes supposedly lived in and solving some dastardly crimes in the Sherlock Holmes style.  This \\"new\\" Holmes character that is played fantastically buy Benedict Cumberbatch has all of the peculiarities and what may be considered strange and peculiar ways as the original Sherlock had except, to me, with far more energy.  This increased energy level combined with all of the new technology at his disposal makes for some highly entertaining viewing.  I just love this series and look forward to purchasing future seasons.  It's really a terrific series.      Know that this series is very well written, directed and acted.  It is very fast paced with no dull bits.  I used the subtitles to make sure that I was able to fully comprehend the brilliant and often funny dialogue.
B0043A0PXU|1.0|I bought this album with the belief that I would positively like it. I purchased it before the audio samples were available on Amazon. I wish I had waited. This album is awful. The issue isn't song selection or arrangements. The issue is Annie's voice as it sounds extremely strained. I thought maybe she had some throat surgery that I was unaware of. Nope. I listened to the whole album once and it pained me to do so. I am shocked that Annie would put forth a product that is as inferior as this is. I can't believe she would expect people to buy an album that is as inferior as this is. I really think that her voice is gone. If it is I think she should either retire or just write for other artists.     Only die hard fans will like the album and defend it. If you are a casual fan of Annie or a fan of Christmas music you will not like this. It is my humble opinion that the five star reviews are by people rating Annie the person and not Annie the artist. It is also my humble opinion that Annie the artist should never have embarassed herself by releasing an album that is this terrible.     I don't recommend one song. Save your money.      My copy of A Christmas Cornucopia has been tossed in the trash and deservingly so.
B002MAQSJ8|5.0|The authors did an excellent job covering all aspects of this crazy story.  A great read to see what kind of ridiculous money Henry Kravis and KKR were able to procure.  The multiple angles and detailed accounts of each character make this book not only educational, but entertaining as well.

0307454541|4.0|One of the few books my friends and I read that thought the book was better than the movie.And we all thought the movie was great.(One member is in the movie business,but preferred the book). To each his own I suppose!
B003UESJF6|4.0|I am so glad that animated movies are coming back into their own. In the past few years we've seen some really good ones like Despicable Me and How to Train Your Dragon and now we have Megamind. The animation is great but what gets this film 4 stars is the fact that while the animation adds to the movie, it is only one aspect of the film's appeal. The dialogue and characterization are strong too.<br /><br />  It is, of course, the thinly disguised story of Superman, but told from his arch enemie's(Lex Luthor) point of view. It's also a look at what happens when society fails a child who just doesn't fit neatly into a pigeon hole. Because Megamind is different than his peers(because of his looks and intelligence) he relates to them a bit awkwardly which in turn makes him feel even more different and alienated. At some point he reasons that if he is treated like a bad kid, that he might as well be a bad kid, and  \\" MegaMind, incredibly handsome criminal genius and master of all villainy! \\" was born.<br /><br /> Megamind is also pretty even handed. When characters in this movie are bad,or cowardly, or act in ways that are beneath them, it's for an understandable human reason. I think the movie makes the arguement that if people could reach a more mutual understanding of each other, then we might be able to start to eliminate much(but not all) of the evil and misery in this world. It has real heart<br /><br />  That's just the underlying philosphy though. It's nowhere nearly as preachy as I might be making it sound.  The movie is peppered with cool regferences to various Superman incarnations and plenty of humor.The animation is fantastic, especially Megamind's \\"Death Blimp\\". I saw it for the first time with a huge audience which connsisted of both older animation fans and young families and everyone had a great time. I looked around occassioanlly and saw people of every description laughing through out the movie. There is something for eveyone to enjoy in Megamind. It's a guaranteed good time for anyone with a heart beat.(Honestly, even the undead would probably crack a smile here and there.)ime for anyone with a heart beat.(Honestly, even the undead would probably crack a smile here and there.)
B0041OOJNU|4.0|I was very critical of She Wolf, a dull uninspired waste of computer generated digits.  Responding no doubt to sales not my review our much loved Shakira has hit back, with at least some effect.    I see one other reviewer has marked this album down on its diverse types of songs.  But this at least is the album's strength.  Yes there are too many dull monotonic computer generated beats in there, but there is the diversity in there too that gives us at least a few songs of Shakira on form.    Some of the songs are very deliberately catchy - she does that so well.  And she continues with those quirky Shakira lyrics I love.  There are a couple of quieter tracks in there that I don't like, but that's me.  I never like them.  Some will love them.    CD-technical quality wise , this is, again and like all new CDs, just another piece of volume maximised garbage, but at least it is smoothly done, most won't notice.    My suggestions for the next album - use a real drummer on ALL tracks, tell who ever is selected to master the thing that quality not volume comes first, and keep up the diversity!    Cheers!

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|Ever since I got the playstation 3 I have not bought a DVD if I could help it. Why collect the old format if a new one is available. Of course Blu-Ray does not always live up to expectations. The presentation of Iron Man 2 is good, and the package has all your could ask for: Deleted Scenes, extra content, background info on the characters, and the movie looks and sounds great. The set also features a DVD copy for use when a Blu-Ray is not available.    As for the movie, it's good but it's not great. I am a fan of superheroes, especially Marvel's characters. I'm not sure these movies are doing them justice. For examlee there's an annoying habit they have of taking the characters out of costume. Iron Man, needs to have his armor on to be Iron Man. If he is in armor he should not be constatnly opening his visor. The action is good but there is not as much as one would hope. And must all Superhero movies include an origin of some sort (the villian Whiplash in this case)?    On the plus side the actors do a great job. Sometimes Tony Stark is a bit too smarmy to be likeable but that's the scripts fault. The actors are good and they do a great job of humanizing their characters, which is the most importatnt part in movie of this type: we have to empathize with the people to believe anything that is going on.    I liked it. But I didn't love it.
B0032Y8XH8|2.0|I have read that this group has a following, but I just don't get their music.  In my opinion, the \\"melodies\\" weren't creative and melodic, but simplistic, derivative, and boring; the lyrics were pretentious; and the lead singer's voice is an acquired taste.  I tried to like this, but repeated listens just made the whole thing harder to listen to.  Not my cuppa.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|Annie Lennox is an extremely talented individual who gives of herself more than many other artists out there. This Christmas collection is no exception. It is NOT for everybody however. Many of the selections are madrigal and obscure to the average individual. People who have taken voice, performance classes such as choral, and music educators would be the most likely to be ABLE to appreciate her efforts. Alas, the teeming masses yearning for Christmas make out music will need to look elsewhere. I found the unique twists on the songs to be very enjoyable and relaxing to listen to. I will be keeping this playing throughout the holidays.
1439133948|3.0|I have loved all the MVK books, though they are a singular aberration for me in that i've listened to them all, rather than read them directly. I happened upon &#34;Falling Free,&#34; read by the incomparable Grover Gardner & he became the voice of the series for me. I have listened to all the Miles Vorkosigan books several times. I was thrilled when Ms McMaster-Bujold came out with the eagerly-awaited next book, & happy as a clam when I saw that GG once again was the reader.<br /><br />Then I started listening. The opening was a bit disorienting at first --I kept backing up to see if I'd accidentally skipped a section that told me what the heck had happened to Miles-- but then when that was sorted out, I started waiting for something to happen. And waited. And waited. There was lots of conversation, the critter zoo struck a chord with me, but it really seemed by the end that not much had actually happened.<br /><br />I kept thinking that McMaster-Bujold somehow managed to forget that phrase they drill endlessly into anyone who's ever taken a beginning Creative Writing course: &#34;Show, don't tell.&#34; M-B tells & tells, but doesn't do much showing. I suppose I should say *SPOILER ALERT* because<br /><br />even tho' we lose not one but two well-loved characters, we're not actually at the scene (the basically boring scene) of either demise....somebody tells about it in a conversation, so we not only get &#34;told,&#34; we get told at second hand.<br /><br />I agree with various other reviewers that the book lacks the depth, wit, sparkle, action & interest we've come to expect of Ms M-B. As Miles said somewhere or other, the reward for doing a job well is usually another, harder job....and I'd add that if you drop the ball on that harder job, your admirers are going to be even more disappointed because they've learned such high expectations.
B000VPPMXO|2.0|I recently bought a 560 from Bed Bath and Beyond, and purchased these light houses on Ebay. The seller claimed, just like on here, that the light houses work with the 535 and above models.  Unfortunately, that is not the case now.  IT USE TO.  Now the 500 series they have coming off the line no longer support the light houses, unless you purchase the 570 or above models.  So my 560 will not work with these. :(  And I cannot return the light houses either.  Wish I had purchased the items from Amazon instead; they are so great with returns.  I'm sure the product would have worked great......instead I have a Roomba that is just all over my lower floor.
B003DZX44I|5.0|It came quickly.  It's going to be a Christmas gift, so I have not opened it.  I've never had a problem with the many DVD's I've ordered from Amazon.
1926778103|4.0|This book is certainly one of the best concept art books I've ever bought. I was flabbergasted at how thick the book was as well as how dense with content. I've spent more on much less before on these types of books. Not only does it contain concept art and renders of characters, places, etc., but it also shows concepts on something that I haven't seen any other book do: typography and logo. It actually features the Darksiders title and logo concepts as well as everything else, along with other symbols and insignias. The book also has gorgeous finished works in the back. Definitely worth the price and a must-have for aspiring designers and artists. It's an extremely valuable reference for successful visual development in video games.    *EDIT*    After owning this book for a short while, the pages are already starting to come out. It seems the gluing job was not done that well. I haven't even flipped through it too much and this is already happening. I would have thought the binding would have been better for such a heavy book.
044656740X|5.0|This book is wonderful start on your financial education and I would recommend to my family and friend as well as encourage them to attend basic and advance training to learn to own your own business in real estate investing.  I know I have become commmited and excited to start my business correctly.  At times the book does overwhelm me with examples of the Rich Dad Quadrant and Balance Sheets, but after reviewing the example and watching Rich Dad DVD or YouTube explanation to understand better.  Invest in your life and get financial education for yourself and not let others on the left side of the cash flow quadrant tell you want to do, unless that is what you want for your life.  Good luck!!  Get Excited!!
B00447G29S|5.0|I will admit, 2 years ago I purchased The Polar Express 3D with the red and blue glasses.... it about made me sick when I watched it.  The colors made me dizzy and the picture was heavily distorted.  This on the other hand was a breath of fresh air! The 3D quality on this blu-ray disc is absolutely superb with minimum \\"ghosting\\".  One stand out scene in particular is portrayed on the front cover of the Blu-Ray case, the train skating on the ice.  The 3D effects are so fantastic here that I had to play it over a few times.  Its enough to make you say WOW.  Also, the entire North Pole scene is absolutely beautiful especially the zoom outs showing the large Christmas tree and all the kids and elves surrounding it.    I would highly recommend this to anyone with a 3D television! The picture is stunning and the 3D effects are breathtaking!  The world of Blu-Ray 3D is growing, and this one definitely stands as one of the top 3D releases so far!
0374531943|5.0|My friend recommended this book to me and it delivered.  Collins starts off slow, describing his work and life leading up to NASA. But the book builds from there, getting more and more interesting with each turn of the page. It climaxes with the Apollo 11 trip to the moon, then wraps things up nicely.  Collins proved to be an excellent story teller. This book comes through as very sincere, in part because it was all written by Collins himself. He made it feel as if I were there with him and John Young on Gemini X. You also get to see how the astronauts interacted with each other on the training and flight for Apollo 11.    I would recommend this book for someone looking for great stories and a unique perspective on these historic events.    I would not recommend this book for someone interested in the technical details of spaceflight or astronaut 'gossip'.
1423113381|4.0|Like Percy Jackson series much better but this one was entertaining.  There are 6 in the family who have read this book and half of them liked it and half of them prefer his other books.
0060531053|5.0|I had been brewing for about a year before I bought this book, so I came into it knowing a bit about what I was doing. But this book greatly expanded my knowledge. It's great for beginners and intermediate brewers.    For beginners it covers the basics and has enough to get you started.    For intermediate brewers, it has tips and tricks to help you brew better. Ever wonder if there's anything you can do about the haziness of your beer? Or what can you do to improve the head quality? Or how to use additional ingredients like spices and fruits?     For everyone else it has some great recipes to try. I particularly like the holiday ale.    I use it every time I brew and have earmarked and highlighted different things to try - recipes, ingredients and things to make brewing easier.
B000V6OMJS|5.0|ANDREW LLOYD WEBER IS SO MUCH A SPIRITUAL INSPIRATION. HIS MUSIC CAN INDEED AROUSE AND INSPIRE WITH WHAT IS HIS VERY OWN SIGNATURE MUSIC. HIS WORKS ARE ABOVE SENSATIONAL. SONGS LIKE \\"TELL ME ON A SUNDAY\\", \\"AN UNEXPECTED SONG\\", \\" McCAVITY THE CAT\\" ARE ALMOST INDESCRIBEABLE WITH BRIGHTMAN DOING THE RENDITIONS. IT IS AN ABSOLUTELY SPLENDID COLLECTION FROM TWO SUCH GREATS AS WEBER AND BRIGHTMAN. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY UNSURPASSABLE IN WHAT IT IS THEY LEND TO THE PROFESSION. THEY ARE ABSOLUTELY MASTERFUL ON THE ALBUM.
0810995212|5.0|brilliant image quality and the sheer quantity of them is great.   enjoyable read and his life was fascinating.  if you're interested in illustration or clothing this is a worthwhile investment.
B00428CPUY|5.0|The best thing about the DVD is the same as the best thing about the concert, namely the variety of \\"jam sessions\\" of various artists playing together (e.g. two songs by Buddy Guy, Johnny Lang, and Ronnie Wood).  You get to hear rare authentic musicianship with \\"soul\\" that comes through artists who do not come together otherwise, but love coming together for Crossroads (e.g. comments by Vince Gill \\"I'd come even if I wasn't invited,\\" Sheryl Crow \\"this is my favorite gig,\\" Buddy Guy \\"I feel like I'm in heaven\\").  Don't buy this DVD to hear your favorite artists do their usual things because there isn't enough of anyone for that.  Buy it for the rare opportunity to hear 4-1/2 hours of highlights from a group of friends having a 12 hour jam session.    The only major things missing are Bill Murray's hilarious opening (\\"give me less guitar\\"), Jeff Beck's song featuring bassist Rhonda Smith, and the \\"Sweet Home Chicago\\" finale (probably because Clapton thought 25 guitarists was too many).
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I received the new Norah Jones CD from the One2One Network last week. I was really excited when the CD arrived because I have always been a huge Norah Jones fan. While this was a surprise to me when I started listening to it (because i had not read any of the press about it and didn't realize it was a compilation rather than pure Norah herself), I have been playing it each night while I prepare dinner and I have thoroughly enjoyed it. It's such a departure from a normal CD, that it is a treat to listen to. The variety keeps me interested and the breadth and depth of voices keeps me impressed. There is something for everyone on this CD. I highly recommend it.
B003R0LBVW|1.0|I can't believe I actually finished this book.  It was terrible.  I was looking forward to reading this since I somewhat enjoyed Franzen's last book.  What a mistake!  I should have read the reviews before I bought it.  I'm still wondering why Oprah endorsed this and according to her \\"this will be the BEST book you've ever read\\".  Really???  Did someone pay you to say that???  I can't figure out how this could be the best book ever.  I'm guessing she picked it because of all the political crap dredged through it.      All I can say is, save your money.  There are MUCH better books out there.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|This is a great CD release effort by the talented pop/R 'n B sensation Rihanna, titled \\"Loud\\". The CD opens with a great dance track, \\"S & M\\". \\"What's My Name?\\" is a solid track/gem with great vocals by Rihanna & great rapping by Drake. \\"Cheers(Drink To That)\\" is a rather great 'laid-back' track. The 'Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah' sound on this track is quite similar to Avril Lavigne's in the song \\"I'm With You\\" from the CD 'Let Go'. \\"Fading\\" is a just an okay track. \\"Only Girl (In The World)\\" is a great electro-dance number. \\"California King Bed\\" is solid track/gem : great acoustic guitar entrance with beautiful clear vocals & great full band joining later on (what a track at that!). This is my favourite track from this great CD. \\"Man Down\\" is a great electro, reggae inspired/infused dance track with fantastic vocals by the lovely Rihanna. \\"Raining Men\\" is a good electro, reggae rap song featuring Nicki Minaj. \\"Complicated\\" is a great electro-pop number, high pitched vocals by Rihanna with simple but yet effective lyrics. \\"Skin\\" is a just okay electro-pop song. \\"Love The Way You Lie (Part 2) is solid closing track/gem, great full band sound with rather strong rapping from the legendary rapper Eminem. On overall, this is a varied but well balanced CD release ('dance', 'electro-pop', 'pop/rock', R n' B & 'rap'), a great CD release effort by the talented Rihanna, a highly recommended listening.
B00005JM02|5.0|Got this as a gift and my girlfriend loved it.  Decent movie even though I'm not into Disney movies.
B0045LSIRM|5.0|This is a great live recording CD by the legendary Canadian rock singer-songwriter Bryan Adams, titled , 'Bare Bones'. It is aptly described as the songs were recorded with only acoustic guitar, sometimes accompanied by keyboard/piano (Gary Breit), vocals, hand clappings & harmonica on \\"I'm Ready\\" as well as on \\"Straight From The Heart\\". The inspiration for this recording springs from the 'Unplugged MTV' recording he did as well as encouragement from his fans who enjoyed this style of music presentation (quite very personal/intimate but yet simple), so says Bryan Adams. CD does show Bryan Adams's versatility as a great live performer of note! It's a great performance, has great production & it's a CD that most of his fans will enjoy immensely. This 1 CD release has 20 songs (released today 11/16/10) as compared to the CD deluxe package/digipak (Deluxe Edition, described as for Bryan Adams' greatest fans) hit the market on 11/30/10. This CD opens very well with \\"You've Been A Friend To Me\\", great acoustic guitar, piano & vocals. One can feel that the audience are enjoying the great live performance. \\"Here I Am\\", continues the theme : great acoustic guitar, piano & vocals. \\"I'm Ready\\", has flute in addition to the usual acoustic guitar & piano. \\"Let's Make A Night To Remember\\", \\"Ain't A Party (If You Can't Come 'Round)\\" & \\" Everything I Do) I Do It For You\\", again great perfomance by Bryan Adams. \\"Cuts Like A Knife\\" & \\" It's Only Love\\" are from his earlier years (his rather hard rock days, rather challenging tracks to do live without a full band), but he manages to bring them very well (studio recordings/full band rather far better than these 2 tracks). \\"Please Forgive Me\\" (at the end of the song he does imitate Bruce Springsteen's voice quite well, with the fans in stitches!), a solid ballad, well executed live performance. \\"Summer Of 69\\", is certainly one of the fans favourite live performed tracks : he does not disappoint, great acoustic guitar chords & string pickings. \\"Walk On By\\", from his 2008 CD release  \\"11\\" : has beautiful guitar string pickings & great vocals, as only Bryan Adams would. \\"Cloud Number Nine\\", has great vocals. \\"Heaven\\", \\"Straight From The Heart\\", \\"The Way You Make Me Feel\\", \\"You 're Still Beautiful To Me\\" are great tracks, Bryan Adams is certainly on the roll, a solid performance. \\"I Still Miss You ... A Little Bit \\", is great jazzy track, great guitar, great vocals & hand clappings by the excited live audience (he proclaims he wrote this song for the late Ray Charles) .    In \\" All For Love\\", Bryan Adams is able to give great vocals (original studio recording had Sting, Rod Stewart & Bryan Adams singing as a trio), the other two singers are not missed because he gives a great vocal performance! On overall, this is a solid performance 1 CD (20 tracks) release by the talented Bryan Adams, recorded during 2008 & 2010 'Bare Bones Live Tour', a great selection of hits & performance, a highly recommended listening.
B001UV4XFG|5.0|Ask any of my friends, I'm a Twilight fanatic (& I'm 50!)!  I like many others dismissed this series as being juvenile, without investigating it myself...until I was stuck in O'Hare for 4 hours and had read every magazine available!  Because this Saga starts out in high school doesn't make it young adult...I believe this seris is adult.  Stephenies publisher simplified the first three books because THEY saw this as young adult.  That was her initial book deal, three books. Breaking Dawn is the 4th and marvelously different. Eclipse and Breaking Dawn are my favorite books, though Twilight is a close 2nd to these two because they introduced these wonderful characters. This film captured the book as much as was humanly possibly in the time they had... I believe all three films would have benefitted from an additiona 10-20 minutes each (especially New Moon - which destroyed Bella and Edwards reunification in dialogue, action & sequence of events).  Eclipse had David Slade - who would have thought it would have taken him to finally complete the picture for this series!!?!  David did it! - Secondly, he knew the talent he had before him... Kristen, Rob, Ashley, Billy, Taylor.. this guy knew what he had and he knew how to direct his talent!  These young people are oh so talented and perfectly cast, but you have to be able to direct young people to get the most out of them - that's what Catherine knew (and Chris forgot!).  Twilight Saga is not just a story line and script on auto pilot and you need to work to translate what we (the fans!) Love!  David Slade did that - Rob did his best work to date - when Bella says \\"yes\\" to marriage - in the book it says (paraphrased) he looked as glorious as an archangel - and Rob pulls that off - as I believe no one else ever could.  Rob is Edward personified, but he cannot do this alone - it takes direction, proper editing & decent dialogue...ECLIPSE is excellent!!! Many who have pooh-pooh'd these movies dig ECLIPSE - because this movie,as in the books, the adult portion of the series really takes over... I wish David Slade was directing Breaking Dawn - Let's hope this new director can garner the same measure of action/edge/emotion and atmosphere that is the Twilight Saga & can direct these actors in the manor they deserve and require - ECLIPSE ACHIEVED THAT!

B003YUC2FE|4.0|Here was something odd when I read the reviews of 1 star ratings - no exclusive content from Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray Special Editions. I received my package today and check on the content and what I found out - all that was originally released for the Special Editions of Toy Story 1 & 2 Blu-Ray are all there. I am not sure if the comparison was the older DVD Ultimate Edition versions of Toy Story but for the Blu-Ray editions, its all featured.    The packaging is quite nice - cheap cardboard I doubt it. Of course, if handle with care it is durable. Still, while the placement of the disc I felt its best if its in a casing, the foam that holds all ten-disc is something I would rather avoid. The box is rather big and the extra stuff which was stuck on the box is rather annoying.    If you love Toy Story series and for those that have yet to own the previous DVD or Blu-Ray editions, this is worth forking out to own this edition.
B003BW0CB6|4.0|No it's not a review as i cannot buy the kindle version as i am in Canada.  I'll give it a 4 though as I'm sure it's good and don't want to fault Michael Connelly fans for this.  Thanks Amazon for recommending a book to me i cannot buy by one of my favorite authors though!!  I suppose i could by the book and have it shipped though...does that make any sense whatsoever???
B0042JTDXK|2.0|It just PAINS me to say this... but I just don't like it. I was at my local Starbucks and I was ecstatic to see that they were selling his new release, \\"Illuminations\\". Prior to this purchase, I'd already been familiar with his single \\"Hidden Away\\" - a piano ballad short of that magic Josh once had with David Foster. Trust me, I wanted to love \\"Hidden Away\\" but I just couldn't force something that I wanted to ultimately come naturally. In any case, seeing that it was new material from Josh, I bought the disc anyway in hoping I'd experience that same joy like that of listening to his previous releases. But no. I didn't feel that magic. I actually cringed. I'm sorry Josh but this lackluster production just doesn't pair well with your voice. I understand that you're channeling raw emotions into your performances but it didn't work. Your beautiful voice is meant for polished production, and should remain in the hands of David Foster.    As I was listening to \\"London Hymn\\" in my room, my roommate texts to me... \\"are you sleeping? it sounds like there are goats in your room.\\" See Josh, that's not the kind of impression you'd want from \\"potential\\" fans.     However, I did enjoy \\"Straight To You\\". Pretty amazing.    Better luck next time Josh. Meanwhile, I'll continue to bask in the glory that is \\"You Are Loved (Don't Give Up)\\".
B003YWUTJI|2.0|I was excited to get a copy of this, from One2One Network, as I love her previous albums. I was a little disappointed in it though. I liked a few of the songs, but not many. Maybe upon listening to it again I'll hear something else I like, but it's not too likely.     I received a copy of the CD, in advance of it's release, from One2One Network in exchange for an honest review.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|\\"...Featuring Norah Jones\\" is a collection of songs Jones has collaborated with other artists on. The musical styles range from Blues to Jazz to Country to Hip Hop to Acoustic, and the artists featured range from Dolly Parton to Foo Fighters to Outkast to Ray Charles to Herbie Hancock, as well as her side projects The Little Willies and El Madmo.<br /><br />On the Blues side of things are \\"Love Me\\" featuring The Little Willies, and the somber \\"Here We Go Again\\" with Ray Charles. The Foo Fighters appear on the surprisingly Jazzy piano-sprinkled \\"Virginia Moon, while Herbie Hancock tinkles the ivories on \\"Court & Spark\\". Her collaborations with Hip Hop artists are grouped together; we find rapper Andr&eacute; 3000 (of Outkast) singing on the acoustic \\"Take Off Your Cool\\", Q-Tip raps on the groovy \\"Life is Better\\", while Talib Kweli raps on \\"Soon The New Day\\". Similarly, the Country songs are grouped together; \\"Loretta\\" featuring Gillian Welch & David Rawlings, the brooding \\"Dear John\\" Ryan Adams, and the perky \\"Creepin' In\\" with Dolly Parton.<br /><br />Other standouts are the quivering \\"The Best Part\\" with El Madmo, the soothing Pop ballad \\"Little Lou, Ugly Jack, Prophet John\\" with Scottish band Belle & Sebastian, the lilting horn-peppered \\"More Than This with Charlie Hunter, and a live \\"Blue Bayou\\" with M.

B002VPE1AW|5.0|This is about the original movie and DVD only, not the 3-disc version being released tomorrow. I'm biased because I loved Avatar and saw it five times in the theaters. The 3D was excellent and enjoyable. By far the #1 complaint was that the special effects were incredible but the plot was boring and unoriginal. The FX are of course amazing but I liked the story as well - \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" set in outer space. Also, Mr. Cameron deserves a little more credit here than what he's been getting. This is an incomplete list and it'd take someone better informed than me to complete it, but here are some of the influences that I spotted: Sir James Frazier, Joseph Campbell, Edgar Rice Burroughs, Frank Frazetta, the Bible (love those Christ-figures), the aforementioned Shakespeare, Joseph Conrad, the Ramayana, Plains Indians, Amazon rain forest Indians, Gaia, T.H. Lawrence, the Masai, Vietnam, the Middle East and that's all I can think of right now. My point is that more thought went into the script than people seem to realize. It is of course very derivative, but there aren't too many totally unique plots out there (show me a few, please). At least Mr. Cameron used high-quality sources for his concept.    Another complaint was Mr. Cameron's politics. I'm not a liberal or a leftist and I wasn't inconvenienced by any attempts to brainwash me into anti-American, anti-military, anti-consumerism, anti-business, anti-capitalism, anti-imperialism or anti-anything viewpoints. I just appreciated the movie and enjoyed the ride. I figured that Mr. Cameron needed despicable villains and henchmen as well as noble heroes and heroines, which is what any epic requires. Because the main evil-doer and his mercenaries and the corporate execs were American, some people got very offended. I just looked at them as handy, all-purpose scoundrels; not as representatives of something I was supposed to hate forevermore. Don't forget, the hero (and Christ-figure) was an ex-Marine. Didn't that balance things out for you? I don't know or care about James Cameron's personal philosophies, I just believe he intended to create an entertaining, enjoyable, enthralling movie and that he succeeded admirably. Anybody who only sees art produced by people who share the same outlook is missing out on a lot of what the world has to offer. You don't have to be converted in order to appreciate someone else's vision.    There has to be a final note about the incredible FX. The visuals were undeniably spectacular and even people who hated the movie itself all agreed on that. A lot of diligence and work and thought and effort went into Avatar and it clearly shows. Mr. Cameron and his actors and crew and staff were obviously deeply committed to their vision and it showed in every scene. My only complaint was the soundtrack. A flick like this deserved a score on the same level as \\"The Good, the Bad and the Ugly\\" or \\"Once Upon a Time in the West\\" or \\"The Last of the Mohicans\\" or \\"The Magnificent Seven\\" (it was, after all, an exciting cowboy movie placed in outer space). It richly deserved a stirring and emotional soundtrack but instead there was mostly innocuous elevator music throughout. I love Leona Lewis but putting her song over the end credits wasted it, IMHO. It would've fit in better during the movie itself, also IMHO.    Anyway, I highly recommend Avatar. Hard to imagine a more enjoyable film.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|On \\"Rated R\\" (which I feel was her best album), Rihanna flirted with darker themes and experimented a bit with sounds. \\"Loud\\" finds her going back to radio-friendly Dance, best exemplified by the hit single \\"Only Girl (In The World), a Techno-ish Dance number (with a shout-along chorus and a bridge lifted from New Order's \\"Blue Monday\\").<br /><br />\\"S&M\\" is reminiscent of \\"Disturbia\\" off of the deluxe edition of \\"Good Girl Gone Bad\\" with Rihanna declaring \\"Sticks and stones may break my bones / But chains and whips excite me\\". Her most recent US no.1 is \\"What's My Name\\" with pseudo martial beats and featuring rapper Drake. Other guest turns are the Dub \\"Raining Men\\" (featuring Nicki Minaj and some vuvuzela sounds), and \\"Love The Way You Lie Part 2\\" featuring Eminem and retaining the chorus from the original.<br /><br />Adding some variety are \\"Cheers (Drink To That)\\" which features Rock guitars, \\"California King Bed\\" is acoustic and Rock tinged, while \\"Man Down\\" is lilting Dub using murder as a metaphor for a break-up and a nice vocal performance. For ballads, there's \\"Fading\\", \\"Complicated\\" (in which she bellows to the songs protagonist \\"You're not easy to love\\"), and the smouldering \\"Skin\\" with a blistering guitar solo.<br /><br />Arresting and to the point.
1439177783|5.0|Probably the most honest autobiography I have ever read. Portia is a terrific author, intelligent and succinct; no ghost writer which even makes her more credible. She will help many people with her story and how she emerged a better person. Glad she found Ellen and also that they are both so compassionate about animals. You go girl!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've been listening to this CD almost non-stop since it began streaming on Josh's facebook page on Friday, Nov. 12th.  I can't decide which song is my favorite - I go from one to another, loving them all.  Typical Josh - there's something for everyone.  Galileo is so beautifully melodic - reminds me of a Broadway musical.  L'Ora Dell'Addio gives me goosebumps (and tears) and Wandering Kind is brilliant - but too short! Josh composed that piece when he was 12 years old.  I want more!  His true fans have waited a long time for this body of work, and they are NOT disappointed!  Welcome back, Josh - we've missed you and we're thrilled with what you've given us.
B0044XV3QY|1.0|I recommend you avoid purchasing the new blu-ray edition until you have ensured that it will work in your player, perhaps by first trying a rented copy or friend's copy of the movie in your BD player.    The Avatar \\"Three-Disc Extended Collector's Edition + BD-Live\\" fails to run in my freshly updated Samsung BD-P1400 player, with April 2010 firmware. In fact, the 2nd disk did play (mostly) with the 2007 firmware, but after the 2010 update, even the 2nd disk wouldn't work. Many other recent discs played well before and after.

B003EV6DBW|1.0|BBC Video Does it again, delivering this show (which I'd rate 4 stars for content) in crummy, stuttery 1080/50i-- which is the UK's HD format for broadcast not for  Blu-Ray.  Everyone else is delivering 1080/24p which is universally compatible.  It's smoother,  looks better and is the current Blu-Ray standard everywhere.  The problem is that unless you have a Playstation 3, you're most likely going to be suffering with a stuttery, jumpy picture, as your player tries and fails to bump up the 1080/50i to 1080/24p.  If you are suffering this issue, manually switch your Blu-Ray player to 1080i output NOT 1080p.  Our US standard for 1080i is 1080/60i not 1080/50i, so it won't be perfect, but it will reduce the issues greatly.<br /><br />The reason that BBC Video in the US keeps dumping these awful 1080/50i releases on the US market is because they are too cheap to re-author the discs from their UK counterparts to the US standard.  Here's an idea-- release them both in 1080/24p.  Imbeciles.
B003DZX44I|5.0|As I enjoyed the movie when I was younger, I knew my children would enjoy it as well.  I was right.  Recommend all these classic Disney movies for all children.
B003SWNRU2|5.0|And so the Metal Gods have vomitith forth the most bone crushing, skull cracking, finger shredding, ear splitting, gut ripping heavy metal glory of the past 20 years. I bought this album based on the reviews here since my only experience with Accept was a tape of \\"Balls to the Wall\\" I owned in the 80s... now I have another CD that sits proudly in the Heavy Metal Vault alongside Megadeth's \\"Rust in Peace\\", Judas Priest's \\"Painkiller\\", and Metallica'a \\"Ride The Lightening\\". EVERY song on this CD is great; when listening, you never think to yourself \\"If they only did this it would be better\\"... IT CAN'T GET ANY BETTER!! The Rhythm section is relentless; the riffs and solos are at once shredding and soaring; the vocals are like a cross between Rob Halford and Lemmy; and the lyrics are incredible... war, doom, metal, disease.. all the classic themes are here! Buy this now. Metal Heaven (or Hell?) awaits.
B0030IIYWA|5.0|All I can say is, these entire line is amazing.  I suggest all the \\"Toy Story\\" movies for anybody who has young children.
B00428ZRFE|4.0|No Umbrella, but more Commercial Friendly Again!<br /><br />I am not a huge Rihanna fan because her vocal strength is limited and because of this, i only want to hear pop perfection tracks from her such as Umrbella. Songs like that, SOS, and Break It Off are where she truly shines. Though she doesn't have a Celine Dion voice, she uses what she has to the best of her advantage by churning out up tempo tracks. She has been known to be the Britney Spears of pop music when Britney herself doesn't have a new release on the charts. But the pop diva was completely missing in her last outing, Rated R.<br />On her newest effort, LOUD, Rihanna shines and gets back to her roots of friendly POP music. She gets back to what made her famous and what she's good at. I am not going to rehash what has already been said, but the album has tons of radio friendly songs and this is a return to form that might welcome back her old fans that bid her adios during her Rated R days. Her voice is radiant when she sings a cappella in California King Bed. I just loved the personal touch before the crescendo of the beats break in.<br />Stand out tracks:<br />Only Girl in the World<br />Love the Way You Lie<br />What's My Name (Minus Drake - he is not needed)<br />Cheers (Duet with Avril Lavigne)<br />Fading<br />California King Bed<br />Complicated (Should be next single)
0547338023|4.0|I was never a fan of Antoine de Saint-Exupery's The Little Prince, probably because I read it as a child, but it is really a book for adults. The philosophical meanderings just struck me as dumb and the character of the little prince as overly precious.    Now I have corrected my fault by growing up, and Joann Sfar has corrected Saint-Exupery's by turning the book into a graphic novel, which actually is the perfect medium for this story. The key to the transformation is that he brings the narrator, Saint-Exupery himself, into the story as a visual presence. This makes the relationship between him and the little prince more concrete and believable than the arms-length relationship in the novel. The reader now sees it rather than experiencing it secondhand.     Sfar hasn't added to the text of the story, but he takes some little liberties with it. In the opening sequence, we find Saint-Exupery musing about grownups and boa constrictors while trying to repair his downed airplane (in real life, he based the story on his experiences while stranded in the Sahara desert after his plane crashed there). The aviator really comes to life in these scenes, hammering away at his plane and then getting bored and trying to balance his tools on his nose, only to have them come crashing down, as he thinks about how boring grownups are. Sfar has kept Saint-Exupery's text but accompanied it with a classic comic-book sequence.     The most jarring thing about this book, and it may be a turn-off for some readers, is the appearance of the little prince himself. Sfar has abandoned Saint-Exupery's delicate, curly haired prince and replaced him with a rougher, more animated, and yet still ethereal little boy. He's not as pretty as the original, but he is less distant. When he says, \\"Draw me a sheep,\\" there is an urgency to it. That comes partly from one simple substitution: Saint-Exupery's prince has blank circles for eyes, while Sfar's has huge, very expressive manga eyes. My initial reaction was that his eyes were too big and made him look like a space alien--but then, I realized, that's what he is.     Although the book is ostensibly a children's book, children may find the philosophical meanderings on the ways of grownups and the circularity of existence rather tiresome. Teens and young adults are more likely to find food for thought here, or at least, fodder for undergrad bull sessions.     In the book, the prince has an encounter with a coquettish flower and visits six planets, each inhabited by a single absurd occupant. Sfar turns these little pseudo-fables into rich, dreamlike sequences, using the originals as starting points but adding more detail and distortion. His flower is an Aubrey Bearsdley confection, and his night skies are alive with planets, shooting stars, and all kinds of activity, which is very appropriate given the theme of the book.     It should be said, for those who aren't familiar with the story, that the Little Prince allows himself to be bitten by a poisonous snake at the end, in order to return to his planet. It struck me as a rather romanticized version of suicide, although it is presented simply as the way for the prince to return home, in a literal, not a metaphorical sense. The book ends with the author's certainty that the prince is back on his home planet, and the hope that he will someday return to earth.     Sfar's adaptation may be jarring to fans of the original novel, but it also makes the book more accessible, and interesting, to those of us who were left cold by the prose version.     -- Brigid Alverson
B00008O0WN|3.0|If you're looking for a good action movie and are not too familiar with Star Trek the Next Generation, I strongly recommend this movie. It has a good and original plot, good acting, and good action scenes. If you are a big fan of STNG, it is likely you might be unhappy with multiple aspects of this movie. For many STNG fans, character consistency and usage are key elements of the series; this is where Nemesis falls short. The STNG series has built up the highest standard of writing and consistency in characters and in story line of any show that I am knowledgeable on; this is part of what makes the STNG series great for me, and I believe the same is true for many other Star Trek fans. I do recommend this movie to all viewers, but I am going to list the problems that I had with it that other STNG fans might agree on.       ***SPOILER ALERT BELOW*** the remainder of the review ***SPOILER ALERT BELOW***       The following points illustrate how the individual(s) who wrote the screenplay did not really understand the characters:     Here's an excerpt that applies:     \\"Star Trek: First Contact and Insurrection director Jonathan Frakes was not offered to direct; if he had, he would have accepted it again.[2] Frakes has gone on record that if he had directed Nemesis, the box office business would have been better than it was. He has said that director Stuart Baird (who had no prior knowledge of the franchise) is one of the reasons why the film failed at the box office.\\"(Wikipedia)    \\"Out of Character\\" incidents - something that just does not happen in STNG - this will not be verbatim, but you'll get the point.    1) Captain Picard jokingly calls Commander Riker Commander Troi. Even considering that they have served together for many years at this point, it is a stretch to believe that Picard would joke like this to Riker in private, much less on the bridge, loud enough for common crewmen to hear.    2) Worf goes against Picard's orders. In the early years, Worf's mindsetwas battle first; he was not very level headed the first couple of seasons, but even then he would never go against the captain's orders on the bridge during a crisis situation. As the series progresses, Worf becomes a far better officer; it is obvious that the logic and diplomatic ideologies of Picard and the crew rub off on him. In one Nemesis scene, Picard tells Worf to not raise the shields; Worf begrudgingly obliges. Worf then discovers something about the confronting vessel that makes him say that he's raising the shields. If this were the Worf that I know, he would have consulted with the captain before going against a direct order. The only exception in a case like this would be if a photon torpedo was already headed directly at them.     3) When the sword impaled Picard's clone, Picard stood there frozen like a 1st year cadet. I understand that he was watching his young self die before his eyes, but this man has been through far worse, and is far too good an officer to freeze at a crucial moment such as this one. This moment alone would ruin a STNG movie for me.     Other problems    With the exception of Picard and Data, the characters did not have the rapport with each other that they have always had in past movies/seasons. In fact, aside from Data and Picard, and maybe Riker, most of the characters were not necessary to the movie in that they were far from integral to the story. One of the great things about STNG is that it always managed to get everyone involved, everyone had a major role. In Nemesis, Worf, Geordi, Troi, and Crusher were closer to being extras than characters with major roles.    Picard and Riker had little more to say to each other than \\"It was an honor serving with you\\" plus a handshake to complete 15 years of service together. I'd think that these two characters would have a lot more to share than that. This falls into the category of the lack of rapport that the characters had with each other.     It's safe to say that whoever wrote the screenplay didn't really understand the characters. It's one of those situations where some guy probably crammed and watched like 25 Star Trek Next Generation episodes in a couple weeks span then set out to make a movie about the series.

1926778103|4.0|The Art of Darksiders is a great \\"art of\\" book. It has high production values and displays a wide array of artwork covering all aspects of the very cool videogame. However, as a fan of Joe Madureira I am a bit disappointed in the book. I expected to see a ton of art from Joe that I had not seen before and this is not the case. A lot of the work by Mr. Madureira that is featured in the book has already been all over the internet, gaming magazines, and the mini artbook that came with the game for a long time. It's great work but I have seen it many times before and my hope in buying this massive new artbook was that it would feature a lot of stuff I had not seen. There is some cool new Joe Mad stuff that is new to me but not nearly as much as there should have been in my opinion.      As I said, this is a great \\"art of\\" book, no question about that. You will enjoy this if you're a fan of concept art, videogames and art in general. Joe Mad fans will certainly dig it as well, as I do, though they may be a bit disappointed in the lack of truly fresh Madureira art.
0345505387|4.0|I see both sides of the pendulum.  I wasn't that into this book...but who would be if you want to dive into a mesmerizing storyline.  This was entertaining by it's own standards.  It can't be compared to the novels.      I have read many reviews asking \\"what was she thinking\\" or \\"who did she write this for\\" etc.  I would hope she was writing this for herself.  Actually, I hope all of her books are written for herself.  I enjoyed and admired the reason she wanted to do this graphic novel and the art work was what SHE wanted it to look like.  It doesn't matter what our image of Jaime is...I'm fascinated in what is HER image of Jaime.  I have tried to compare how I picture the couple compared to how she pictures the couple.  I believe she thoroughly enjoyed this collaborative effort of seeing her mental images come alive and I'm glad I get to be a part of that.  Yes, there are many times in the book I thought...\\"hmmm, why did he do his face like that?\\" but it didn't ruin the experience of the book for me.      I think that's what this book was...an experience for the author, the artist and the reader.  It's not the experience that some expected but I enjoyed the experience all the same.  Thank you, Diana for trusting us with, and allowing us, sneak peaks to your dreams.

It skipped throughout and I couldnt even go to scene selection without it stopping and going back to the beginning. I understand selling things used but they could at least made sure it played. It didnt play at all and there was deep scratches all over the disc. However, i will say that they responded to my issue promptly and gave me my refund without a problem.

B0009UC810|5.0|This movie is the best of the late and great John Belushi with a star performance by Dan   aykkroyd.  Too bad John was a druggie and OS'd.  Their escapades were hilaruois and bring tears to my eyes of laughter.  I recommend this movie if you want to see them at their best.
B002ZG983M|1.0|I'm not someone easily troubled, but when the supposedly ten year old \\"Hit-Girl\\" (who looks about eight) says \\"All right you c***s\\" it drew my attention. It's offensive. Hit-Girl later unrealistically murders twelve gangsters and is beaten severely. I don't find it entertaining to watch a small child hit repeatedly in the face like this. The whole enterprise becomes quite creepy after a while.
B0042JTDXK|1.0|I have been Grobans' biggest supporter since the night I heard him on Ally McBeal.  This is by far the WORST album to bear his name.  I wish I could say that I had liked even 1 track, but no.  He needs to get back to basics and relocate the sound that made him popular.  Yech!

B004ASVS0E|5.0|True to her unique style of singing, Annie has come out with a new album that breaths life back into what has become a rather monotonous genre in the music category - the ever less varrying string of boring Christmas albums that are pumped out each year by artists whose time has long since past. Annie, on the otherhand, has put her all into this new album and released a wonderful array of beautifully rendered holiday classics.  Her voice is still as vibrant as it ever was, and her unique style shines through on every song.  I've listened to this album from start to finish, and I can honestly state that it is a masterpiece of music, with each song as unique as Annie herself, and with each song as satisfying to listen to as the last.  Along with Enya's, and Sarah McLachlan's latest Christmas albums, Annie Lennox's newest album will definitely become an annual favorite of mine every holiday season going forward.
B0037W68F4|5.0|\\"Congratulations\\" sounds like a mesh of Syd Barrett and Arthur Lee, produced by Phil Spector. If you don't like classic rock (or know who those people are), you probably won't like this album. I think their first album was made for singles and the recording industry, while this one was for themselves - music they like to listen to and make. It's more accomplished, with less obvious hooks. Whiners on this site have complained that it doesn't sound like Oracular Spectacular. Bands that don't grow never get any better and you have more of the same thing album after album until the band burns out. Can't wait to see what direction they take next.
B003VS0CX8|5.0|It was fantastic to see this 60's award winning classic in such clarity and crisp sound and sight! We look forward to watching the other Blue Ray movies we have purchased.
B002VECM6S|5.0|This movie was worth all the hype that it generated.  Sanda Bullocks performance was spot on and couldn't have been better, some of the best acting she has done in her career.  The others were just as good but none stood out more than Bullock.  A great movie for all, this is a must movie to add to a DVD collection.  Had good meaning, realistic and heart warming but not on the gushy side which is a plus in my book.  Would recommend to anyone and everyone to at least watch it once before laying down judgment on the film itself or the actors in it.  Great film!!!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|This is an awesome collection from Norah Jones. It is not your usual album of similar sounding songs. With duets with folks from Willie Nelson to OutKast, the album is filled with sounds for every taste. I am personally drawn to some of the songs that are pretty different from my usual sound such as the duet with Willie Nelson, Baby its Cold Outside or Blue Bayou with M. Ward. They just have such a cool feel to them. To me music creates a mood and can totally take you away. And I love all the different places this album takes the listener.

B002Z7FWBI|4.0|A find for the Dirty Harry fan, all of the Dirty Harry films plus a collection of associated documentaries, all for a song. First we have Dirty Harry, the gritty film that made \\"Do you feel lucky, punk?\\" famous, introducing \\"Dirty\\" Harry Callahan tracking a serial killer. Next is Magnum Force, where Harry tangles with vigilante traffic cops and reminded everyone that \\"A man has to live by his limitations.\\" That is followed by The Enforcer, where Harry has to lay down the law on terrorists who kidnap the mayor. Next is Sudden Impact, which made \\"Go ahead, make my day!\\" a household word. Harry is forced to take a vacation when things get to hot in the City, but trouble finds him there too and he must solve a crime while trying to take some time off. Finally, there is The Dead Pool, where Harry discovers a lottery on which celebrity will die next. This film includes a car chase that is both homage and parody of Bullitt, where Harry and partner are chased up and down the hills of San Francisco by a radio-controlled model car loaded with explosives.

B002JVWR0Y|2.0|I was a Dexter die-hard. What a creative show: original, smart dialogue, dark humor, intellectual, thought provoking.    Season 4 lost it. It slowly slipped away and fell off the cliff with the surprise (and disappointing) finale.    Throughout each season, the viewers have had to deal with some unbelievable coincidences, but you could get by them because the show was so good.  The Ice Truck Killer is Dexter's long lost brother and now engaged to his sister??? OK, I'll get by it because the show is too fun to let that drag me down.    It's over for me in Season 4. Dexter has too much baggage now. It's piling up and impossible to believe that everything can tie up so perfectly and neatly for him that he evades the law.

B0041T52S6|3.0|Don't get me wrong...SCOTT PILGRIM is easily a five-star movie, one of the best I've seen this year. But caveat emptor.    The DVD and Blu-Ray will not play properly on all TVs and/or players. In some configurations, the text on the sides of the screen is cut off. It's most noticeable in the scene where Scott sits up in bed and the \\"Other Scott\\" sits up beside him. You can see that the text for \\"Other Scott\\" is cut-off; you can't read all of it.    I have heard that Universal is supposedly issuing a corrected Blu-Ray in February 2011. I don't know about the DVD; I'd hope they'd fix that, too. I've e-mailed them and will let you know what they say.    Meanwhile, proceed with caution, as you may not be able to watch the entire image. For that reason, I'm lowering my star rating, because I have a hard time believing that Universal couldn't reconfigure this disc to fix the problem.

B0002VEW1K|2.0|I was concerned upon ordering this that the great reviews here only represented the views of diehard Procol fans. After listening to this album, I'm afraid I was right. Actually I liked the b-side \\"Drunk Again\\" the best. More than a few songs are unspeakably bad. \\"Fresh Fruit\\" is neither sweet nor fresh.<br /><br />Quite a disappointment for \\"A Salty Dog\\" fan. Not sure whether to take a chance on \\"Grand Hotel.\\"<br /><br />I own the Friday Music remaster (not Salvo)

B003X27L9U|4.0|\\"Room\\" by Emma Donoghue is a remarkable book as well a highly disturbing one. Remarkable because Donoghue keeps the interest and tension going even though she is writing in the first person POV of a 5 year old child (although I was getting pretty sick of it by the end).     Disturbing because of the subject matter (a woman kept prisoner for 7 years and forced to endure the repeated abuse of her kidnapper) and because I felt as if both Donoghue and the reader were being somewhat horribly voyeuristic. Donoghue cashes in (literally) on the current interest/fascination in such cases and we as the reader propagate what I think is an unhealthy interest in knowing 'everything that went on'. Writing from the POV of a 5 year old means that Donoghue can let us know the most intimate secrets - a child, in his innocence, tells the reader things the mother would never do. If Donoghue had used the POV of Ma herself then the Ma's privacy (which she so desperately craves) would be maintained as Ma could control the information getting out. But, no, her 5 year old son tells us, and he tells us everything. All control is stripped from Ma, even her POV, especially her privacy.    All this left me very uncomfortable. Donoghue profits from our vile human tendency to be voyeurs, and we as readers can indulge our nasty little habit to the hilt.

0920668372|1.0|This book has such a sick premise that it left me stunned. If ever an author needed to think about getting psychological help....  Somebody gave this book to my granddaughter, and I had the unfortunate experience of reading it to her. Since she was only 1 1/2 yrs old at the time, it bothered me more than it bothered her, as she was too young to understand why it was so sick!  A mother (who clearly needs counseling) sneaks into her son's room each night to sing him a song and hold him, even when he eventually becomes a man and moves across town! When she is sick and dying, he does the same for her and then repeats the cycle with his own baby.   Don't buy this book! What was the author thinking? Speaking of \\"mamma's boy\\" fantasies!
B004BC7MRM|1.0|First off, let me say I have been a Kid Rock fan since Grits was released on Cassatte tape. I have owned every thing Kid Rock has released. With Devil he hit his peak, all his music before Devil I loved, and Devil was a complete package. Since then it has been downhill. I understand why he went the route he did since Only God Knows Why was the song that made him big (even though it was almost 2 years after the CD came out). Most of his fans now believe Devil was his first CD, and do not mind the change. If you went back and played EMSP or Polyfuze for his current fans they would probably tell you to turn it off, but those were what got me into him. I think Kid Rock is a highly talented artist, no doubt about it,  and seeing him live was awesome. I just lost interest in his music as he changed it more and more from his style to what he thought people wanted. I give him credit for doing what he loves, but long time fans like myself will not be buying Born Free. I listened to the samples on here, and even at the special 3.99 price, this will be the first release I will not buy. Kid Rock should change his name to Kid Old Fashioned Southern Rock. I enjoyed the southern rock songs when they were broke up with the real rock/hip hop songs I loved, but a whole release of slow, same sounding songs is not what this fan wanted. If he continues down this path, I wish him all the luck, but he just closed the door on some of us who carried him til he made it big.

0425221806|5.0|I have been a Koontz fan for years and have read almost all of his books and this still stands at the top of the list.  I can't see anyway this book could have been improved.  I remember reading it for the first time and thinking \\"I don't want it to end\\" and I didn't.  I wish I could unread it so I could read it for the first time again.  I envy friends when they read it for the first time because I can't experience it new again.  I can't explain why I love this book so much but I do.  The story isn't the most ground breaking story ever but the way Koontz delivers it is what makes the story great.  The characters are his best ever and The Outsider is one of a very few villans who I have ever felt bad for.      This is an awesome read from start to finish.
0061997811|5.0|i was truly amazed with this book. the reproduction of the props alone makes the steep price worth it. i spent hours and hours perusing the many inserts in the book such as the letter from hogwarts, the yule ball invitation and the marauders map. the never before seen pictures are all wonderful and highly entertaining. i just hoped they included a hogwarts express train ticket so i can jump in the next train to hogwarts! it's a book that i will cherish for a long, long time!
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Josh really went in a different direction with this album. It's even more different from \\"Awake\\" than \\"Awake\\" was from \\"Josh Groban\\" and \\"Closer\\". The change takes some getting used to, but it has definitely grown on me.    From the vocal-free \\"The Wandering Kind (Prelude)\\" to the love song to New York, \\"The Bells of New York City\\", to the soothing \\"Hidden Away\\" this album is personal and simple, the way the best art is. \\"L'Ora Dell'Adio\\" and \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" are most like the Josh we've become accustomed to.     With \\"War at Home\\" Josh shows us that, as with \\"Noel\\", he hasn't forgotten the soldiers and the battles they face when they've left the war behind. \\"London Hymn\\" sounds as if it should be the background music to a period film (in a good way!). He wraps up the album beautifully with with the emotional love song \\"Straight to You\\".    I love this album, have already bought it for a friend, and look forward to taking this (along with Josh's other albums) to lighten up the downtime during my deployment.
B002Q4TKAO|5.0|If you even remotely like the Killers (or any rock for that matter) this is an absolute MUST BUY!!  It is such an amazing DVD concert! I have prob watched it 50 times and every time I show someone the DVD they become instant Killer fans.  Highly Recommend this awesome DVD! Cheers!
B00433SVP6|5.0|WOW!!! This time Rick really surprised me. This wonderful story filled with surprises made my heart speed up. I read everywhere: in my club, in my house, in my grandmothers house...  My favorite character is obviosly Piper. She is always trying to help even if she is helpless in the fight. When she determine to do something she doesnt rest until she gets it.   What I liked the most is the love story between Piper and Jason. I wished he would finally kiss her. But when Jason remembered something about this other girl. . .  Ahhhhhh!!!   Im kind of telling all the story so I will stop writting. It is a wonderfull book for Percys Jackson followers so dont miss it!
1401923119|5.0|I bought this book when it first came out.  And I still recommend it!  It was fun to read and also intellegently written, especially for intellegent, but not so scientific an audience such as me.  Instead of being a book about hocus pocus...do this and that and wonderful things will happen...this helps to explain the \\"WHY\\" this and that happen, in a world of science that is rapidly, thru quantum physics, is finding and winding it's way to connect with the spiritual life.  I, for one, have never seen or understood why the two have been separate, yet I understand the need for tangible explanations.  I highly recommend this book, as a read and also to keep around as a reference book for those concepts that are difficult to wrap around.
0061119725|5.0|This is an interactive book that makes learning fun for the whole family. The kids learn different body parts, animal names, and movements by actively participating and imitating animals' moves.<br /><br />Each spread features a new animal for kids to remember their names: a penguin, a giraffe, a buffalo, a monkey, a seal, a gorilla, a cat, a crocodile, a camel, a donkey, an elephant, and a parrot.<br /><br />A penguin on the first page, for example, shows a girl how he can turn his head to the side and challenges her to do the same : \\"Can you do it?\\" The girl turns her head and answers: \\"I can do it!\\" And so it goes on with each animal and a new body part: head, neck, shoulders, arms, hands, chest, back, hips, knees, legs, foot, toes. The repetition of the phrase \\"Can you do it?\\" invites listeners to answer \\"I can do it!\\" It's a perfect book for \\"active\\" listeners, play time, and group reading.<br /><br />The collage illustrations are very simple yet bold and bright. Every page is full of color and texture, making objects look like they are moving or coming off the page. Simple white background compliments the colors nicely.<br /><br />Julia Shpak<br />Author of \\"Power of Plentiful Wisdom\\".

B003DE9W3Q|1.0|This album sucks. It's the worst I've ever heard from Alan Jackson, and this is nothing like his early stuff. The melodies of these songs are terrible. This is some of the worst Country Music ever. I'm a big Country Music fan and a big Alan Jackson fan, but this album is nothing like his early albums when he was still hungry and writing songs that had good melodies and a lot of heart. I'm really disappointed. :(
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie, thusfar, is one of a kind and captures a lot of what made the comic so wonderful. Those who are afraid of Michael Cera should give it a try, he is enough like Scott for the movie not to have lost too much in translation.
B00008DDXC|5.0|The movie is great I've seen it many times and love it! which is why I was REALLY upset when the sender of this product sent me the 3rd Harry Potter movie instead of the second... I'm currently missing the second harry potter DVD, but now I have 2 copies of the prisoner of Azkaban... As a Harry Potter fanatic this really upset me...    I recommend the movie but make sure you get it from a reliable source... no more online shopping for me...
0143118420|2.0|I read EPL when it first came out in 2007, after a major break up. At the time, parts of it truly spoke to me, but i was disappointed that the author nauseated us with details of her new romance in Bali in the end (overall I would have said, Italy was fun & entertaining, India OK & Bali, not good).  I am re-reading it now in the fall of 2010, coming from a very different life situation. I am struck by how \\"chatty Cathy\\" the writing is. If that is what speaks to people, that is fine, but it is not the literary masterpiece that it is made out to be.  Surely there is something about this tale that is universal that speaks to mass audience.  Truth is, it is only human for those who are married to secretly dream of escaping (at least for a while) & to go off traveling (on a huge advance at that!)... so maybe that is why so many love this tale? I don't see anything that she did to be particularly brave as a traveler, or as a female. i think for a relationship addict to resist falling into yet another relationship for the last 3rd of the book would have sent a more empowering and deep message. Those are my personal issues with the character in this book. I happen to think EG in real life is a very intelligent soulful person (at least she is at TED lectures), so i can't help but thinking that she dumbed her book down to have mass appeal. This is a Disney story for adults -- same old message: you need a man in order to be truly happy or successful.
B0040YFR1Y|4.0|THE MOVIE<br /><br />'Predator is/was one of my favorite 'background' movies - the quintessential 'guy' flick. I watch it when I feel like passively allowing the on-screen violence fill me up with thrills with no need for a lot of thinking or interpretation. It's not that complicated, really. All they want is 'to kill us' and 'we' (mostly Arnold) must kill them before they can follow us home and... kill more of us. Predator was near-perfect in that regard. A few 'political' background hints at the start to set the stage for the slaughter about to follow and then everything flowed smoothly: big men fighting and dying and in the end, as expected, the future governator showing the nasty alien that one of ours can best one of theirs if he puts his mind to it and tries really hard.<br /><br />The sequels, up until 'Predators' were so-so. 'Predator 2', a serious shooter but way too many twists in the plot and... no thick, green, oppressive jungle and no past or future governors playing major parts. Not even one. 'Predator vs. Alien', a near-abomination. Boring, unneeded, probably bad for BOTH franchises.<br /><br />So here comes 'Predators', an honest attempt to go back to the glorious Predator roots. A diverse number (not exactly a group) of convicted murderers, mercenaries and government special/lethal forces are literally dropped on a alien planet - the apparent favorite hunting resort for the species to which the original Predator belongs - and... the hunt is on. What else is there to say? Given the uncomplicated nature of the plot saying more would probably spoil the fun of actually watching the movie. Without revealing the plot, 'Predators' comes the closest to the original's purity and near-perfection. It's not quite 'there' - I'm pretty confident that there are no future governors or heads of state in the cast - but it's a honest, enthusiastic, worthy sequel that fans should watch and appreciate. I know that I did.<br /><br />THE BLU-RAY EDITION<br /><br />'Predators' gets one of the better Blu-ray treatments.<br /><br />The better than decent picture is supported by a DTS-HD Master Audio sound track in English or 5.1 Dolby Digital alternates for Spanish, French and Portuguese. Subtitles are available in English SDH, Spanish, Portuguese, Cantonese and Mandarin Chinese.<br /><br />Special features<br />-----------------------<br />There are some interesting special features, most notably a series of well-done motion comics prequels that attempt to reveal the 'pre drop' whereabouts of some of the movie's characters.<br /><br />Also notable, a commentary sound track with Robert Rodriguez and Nimrod Antal discussing movie-related topics while the movie plays.<br /><br />'Evolution of the species: Predators reborn' is a High Def, 40 minutes, basically the inevitable 'the making of' and featurette. If there was any doubt in my mind - and there wasn't - the principals eloquently convinced me that they were most respectful to the original Predator legacy and that they gave it all to making the best Predator sequel they could possible make. Includes chapters such as 'Bloodline', 'Decloaking the invisible: alien terrain', 'Intelligent design: the hunting camp', 'Predators as prey', 'Yautja transformed' and 'Rite of passage'. Worth watching. Really.<br /><br />'The Chosen' is the other HD extra, really a 5-minute trailer that presents the main characters. It's okay but it's really a trailer and it should not be of much interest once the movie is watched.<br /><br />In addition the extras include: 'Fox movie channel presents making of a scene' in low def and not as good as 'Evolution of the species'. Also, deleted and extended scenes, and another theatrical trailer.<br /><br />Search<br />-----------<br />Predators lacks the in-movie trivia that other Blu-ray releases have but the search feature allows you to lookup specific scenes, your own bookmarks and, quite impressively, perform 'live lookups' via IMDB - the Internet movie database, providing information on characters, actors, crew and other film-related information. Well done.<br /><br />Live content<br />----------------<br />If you are missing the half-hour pre-movie show you get at the theater, mostly trailers, this disc has it under its own menu option and it's brought to you live, via an Internet link so that you can get the latest trailer and other promotional material.<br /><br />DIGITAL COPY<br /><br />Can be run on a PC or a Mac (Windows Media or iTunes) and on any portable devices that support pocketBLU. If your portable device has a camera, you may be able to avoid entering the activation code and point the camera to the 2-dimensional bar code instead. Help on 'how to' transfer the digital copy to your favorite device is available through the movie's menu.<br /><br />MY EVALUATION<br /><br />The movie was a 3-star for me (vs. me rating the original Predator as a 5-star). The Blu-ray edition with its well done and original animated prequels and interesting 'making of' extra is a solid 4-star. The effort to making the digital copy a more user-friendly process is much appreciated.<br /><br />Overall, a 4-star rating (I like it) is probably fair.

1440503257|4.0|My nine-year-old Harry Potter fan grandson is greatly enamored with this cookbook, but I'm not so enthused.  The format and recipes follow the books well and he instantly lit up at the thought of having Cauldron Cakes for breakfast among other things he recognized and was eager to try.  I'd hoped he could make the recipes himself but they are much more elaborate than I expected.  Some require roasting nuts, tempering eggs, boiling sugar, deep-frying or using the food processor, for example, not things I want a nine-year-old trying.  Many of the processes seem needlessly complex like making a sugar syrup for lemon pops instead of just whisking the sugar into the cold liquid until it dissolves (which we did and it worked fine).<br /><br />I did appreciate that my grandson was interested enough in tackling some recipes that he was willing to learn about kitchen gadgets and processes.  He learned how to measure and what various terms meant and was proud of his results, but I changed some things to facilitate his being able to work more independently.  He learned about substitutions because a number of the ingredients were not available in my well-stocked kitchen.  I actually had a pie pumpkin for example (for pumpkin juice) and turbinado sugar but don't keep things like dried currents or mincemeat on hand all the time.  I usually cook from scratch so have raw ingredients, but many recipes still required a trip to the store.  I was surprised more shortcuts weren't included to appeal to kids or inexperienced cooks who wanted to try their hand.  Some of the recipes had two pages of instructions and most of the book is in miniscule font that I had trouble reading.<br /><br />On the good side, the layout of the book was great fun for my grandson. Each recipe starts with a paragraph about where the dish was included in the stories, who made it, etc.  Then there was an interesting sidebar with history of the dish in English cuisine (interesting to me anyway :).  There's a good index at the back and the book starts with a table of contents that lists chapters with descriptive names.  The recipes are sometimes grouped chronologically and sometimes by food type, like the first chapter `Good Food with Bad Relatives' refers to things Harry ate with the Dursleys, while a later chapter is `Desserts and Snacks at School'.  It's not so easy to find the recipe you want that way, but lots of fun for the fan to read by those groupings.<br /><br />Bottom line: There's a lot good about this cookbook, but it's not for kids to cook from except for a few recipes. It is great reading for fans, both young and old, and would be fun for adult fans to cook from if one doesn't mind fairly involved processes. Things are described well, a great help for less experienced cooks, and we've enjoyed everything we've tried so far although I don't think we'll be trying the Steak and Kidney Pudding (where would I find the lamb or ox kidneys anyway) or the Black Pudding or Stewed Tripe and Onions :). Still they make for fun reading. A great plus for me is that the whole idea of eating 'Harry Potter food' is beguiling enough to tempt some timid young eaters around here to try something new.  I just wish the recipes weren't quite so elaborate.e back and the book starts with a table of contents that lists chapters with descriptive names.

B003Z39G0O|5.0|Disclaimer: I have never watched \\"The Vampire Diaries.\\" It's one of those hundreds of TV shows I plan to get around to watching sometime.<br /><br />But I don't plan to wait to listen to the music. In fact, nobody with a taste for good music should hold off on \\"The Vampire Diaries: Original Television Soundtrack,\\" an onslaught of brilliant alternate rock (Silversun Pickups), pop (Bat For Lashes) and a tinge of electronica (Goldfrapp). Lots of beats, lots of strong melodies, and lots of great remixes.<br /><br />The album opens with a trickling, delicate melody called \\"Stefan's Theme,\\" which sets a suitably haunted atmosphere for... you know, a soundtrack based on a VAMPIRE show. After that, we're hit by a trio of rock anthems: Placebo's brooding, haunted \\"Running Up That Hill,\\" the Silversun Pickups' buzzing whirling rocker \\"Currency of Love,\\" and the murky beat-heavy \\"Hammock\\" by the Howls.<br /><br />Then the soundtrack dips into softer songs: fragile little ballads (Digital Daggers, Stateless, Plumb), dramatic pop anthems (Sounds Under Radio, Mads Langer), gleaming chilly techno (Goldfrapp), earthy acoustic guitar ballads (Jason Walker), blazing zwippy pop-rock (Sky Ferreira), and a creepy finale by Michael Suby that flickers between dark urgency and delicate eeriness.<br /><br />The best songs: the nimble electro-riddled \\"On Melancholy Hill (Feed Me Remix)\\" by Gorillaz, the Smashing Pumpkins' lean blazing \\"Fellowship, and Bat For Lashes' \\"Sleep Alone,\\" which is remixed with a darker edge, strong beats and great cloudy swathe of synth.<br /><br />Rock, indie pop, electronica, and some solid remixes that enhance the quality of the original.

Some are soft and romantic, some are ominous and eerie, and some are just out-'n'-out rock that adds an urgent tone to the soundtrack. All the artists do a good job evoking the right moods... except one. I adore Goldfrapp's \\"We Radiate,\\" but it is totally out of place, since it doesn't sound like any of the other songs.<br /><br />And the instrumentals by Michael Suby serve as nice bookends to the rest of the music -- one is a nice buildup to the rest of the songs, and the other is a dramatic, complex outro.<br /><br />I don't know if the songs fit the TV show, but \\"The Vampire Diaries: Original Television Soundtrack\\" is a brilliant collection of excellent songs.

B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|... on the 10-year-old release. I have the word of my local video-nook manager, and his opinion is supported by most of the reviewers. I rented, therefore, the older DVD, which I got to keep longer for the same rental fee. Here's my review based on that edition:<br /><br />Yes, Little Pig, the Big Bad Wolf Does Eat Pork!<br />The Big Bad Wolf, in this fictional account of ruthless  criminal insider trading on Wall Street, is Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). The Little Pig is a young financial nobody named Charlie Fox (Charlie Sheen), who uses a lot of chutzpah and an accidental tip from his father to hook up with Gekko, whom he aspires to emulate. The father (Martin Sheen) is that rarity in modern America, an honest man who'd rather work productively than get rich quick. The year is 1985, Reagan is President, Greed is both patriotic and Divinely approved, and the stock market is bullish. 2% of Americans own 50% of all wealth, with two-thirds of that wealth inherited. Money, according to Gekko, is not 'made' but merely transferred to those who have the 'stuff' he has, the same 'stuff' he professes to see in young Fox. He will, of course, betray his naive protege when and if ....<br /><br />It's the superb acting of Douglas and Sheen, and the taut directing of Oliver Stone, that make this film hugely successful as drama. Whether it fairly represents the ethical morass of high finance in America and the deplorable failure of American ideals, or rather unfairly caricatures the wizards of Wall Street who revitalized American business, has been a point of controversy ever since the film first appeared. Critics have derided Oliver Stone as a lefty extremist pursuing an anti-capitalist agenda. There ough to be a \\"viewers' discretion\\" warning on this film, I think; if all you know about the stock market is what you hear on TV and radio talk shows, you really aren't qualified to judge it except as entertainment. And believe me, it is entertaining.<br /><br />Some of the people involved in making the film have asserted that Gekko's character was based on the real-life figure of Michael Milken, the Junk Bond KIng, who was convicted of securities fraud as a result of an investigation of insider trading in 1989. Other candidates for the prototype of Gekko include the disgraced Ivan Boesky, who delivered a famous speech extolling Greed at UC Berkeley in 1986 and who lived by that ideal to the hilt. It happens that I knew Michael Milken personally for a while; he was the close kin of an in-law of my wife. His family and my wife's family had been going to each other's Bar Mitzvahs for decades. Michael Milken was formidably quick-minded and cool-headed about greed, but he was neither as handsome nor as steely-blue menacing as Gekko. As a study of financial concupiscence, however, Gekko could well represent Milken.<br /><br />And now? Gordon Gekko has remained an iconic figure, such a plausible portrayal of the archetypal Wall Streeter that many people think the film was based on true-life events. But here's the irony of political polarization in the USA: the same people who rave against Wall Street, who thoroughly believe that every broker and trader is another Gordon Gekko, are also the people who denounce Barack Obama's proposed regulations of banks and stock markets! and whose 'faith' in God-given free-market capitalism blindfolds them to the odious truth of Gordon Gekko's credo of selfishness.have asserted that Gekko's character was based on the real-life figure of Michael Milken, the Junk Bond KIng, who was convicted of securities fraud as a result of an investigation of insider trading in 1989.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|I think Norah Jones is amazing with her soulful sound and I find the majority of her music soothing. I have to say my favorite song of the new album is #1 Love Me, though I dont think there is a song that I didn't like. No matter who she is singing with I think that Jones' voice is the most compelling element. I think Norah's album ...Featuring is a must listen. Either on a car ride or lounging around the house ...Featuring has a sound for just about everyone.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|A friend and I shoot sketches and short videos on his Canon 7D and we use these lav mics for the sound. Their long cords are perfect for situations in which we want to hook up directly to the on-board audio on the camera and their frequency response is pretty stellar as well. The only issue we had was a shielding one, we had to make sure cell phones were a solid 10-15 feet away or else we'd get interference noises. Something to keep in mind, but overall, great product for the price!

Definitely a must read for anyone that is willing to change and wants to evolve with the planet. Sometimes hillarious how spot on he is, forget the shame, just be happy you have the chance now to improve!

B0043ZDU1E|4.0|There has always been a heavy Celtic influence on Loreena McKennit's music, right back to the beginning of her career. But \\"The Wind That Shakes The Barley\\" may be her most Celtic album to date -- a collection of nine Celtic folk songs, driven by McKennitt's powerful voice and some beautiful traditional instrumentation.<br /><br />It opens with a hearty rendition of \\"As I Roved Out,\\" a ballad about a young soldier secretly meeting his lover one night, which is a pretty earthy peppy song for the usually ethereal McKennitt. And in the same tone, there's the bodhran-tinged melody of \\"The Star of the Country Down,\\" and the silvery-edged earthiness of \\"Brian Boru's March.\\"<br /><br />McKennit sounds more at home in the slower songs: the harp melody of \\"On A Bright May Morning,\\" the melancholy afternoon ballad \\"Down By The Sally Gardens,\\" the tragic string-laden title ballad, the melancholy wobbles of \\"The Death of Queen Jane,\\" and the languid instrumental \\"The Immigration Tunes.\\"<br /><br />Best moment in the album: the fairylike shimmers of the final song, \\"The Parting Glass\\" (complete with McKennitt's whispered, \\"... that I should rise/and you should not/I'll gently rise and softly call/Good night and joy be with you all\\").<br /><br />\\"The Wind That Shakes the Barley\\" is a pretty good glimpse of Celtic music as a whole -- there are peppy songs about pretty girls and Irish lads falling in love, but underneath the surface there is blood, tragedy and powerful emotions. It makes you think of early mornings in the forest, cloudy skies and a gentle rain on green fields that stretch out to the sea.<br /><br />Unlike in McKennitt's other albums, there isn't any Middle-Eastern or Mediterranean influence in these songs. It also feels sparer and less lush than her previous work, turning it into a purely Celtic sound. Instead you have an earthy tapestry of fiddles, guitars, pipes, bells and the dull thuds of the bodhran, as well as her omnipresent rippling harp.<br /><br />My one problem with this album? The peppier songs. I like \\"As I Roved Out\\" and \\"The Star of the County Down,\\" but they're too simple and chipper for McKennitt's powerful, haunting vocals -- it always sounds like she's dying to just burst out, but doesn't because the songs don't call for it. Fortunately, the slower, sadder songs fit her beautifully.<br /><br />\\"The Wind Shakes The Barley\\" has a couple of songs that fit McKennit like a three-fingered glove, but otherwise it's an exquisite, haunting tribute to Celtic music.like \\"As I Roved Out\\" and \\"The Star of the County Down,\\" but they're too simple and chipper for McKennitt's powerful, haunting vocals -- it always sounds like she's dying to just burst out, but doesn't because the songs don't call for it.

B00003CXDB|5.0|The Big Bad Wolf, in this fictional account of ruthless  criminal insider trading on Wall Street, is Gordon Gekko (Michael Douglas). The Little Pig is a young financial nobody named Charlie Fox (Charlie Sheen), who uses a lot of chutzpah and an accidental tip from his father to hook up with Gekko, whom he aspires to emulate. The father (Martin Sheen) is that rarity in modern America, an honest man who would rather work productively than get rich quick. The year is 1985, Reagan is President, Greed is both patriotic and Divinely approved, and the stock market is bullish. 2% of Americans own 50% of all wealth, with two-thirds of that wealth inherited. Money, according to Gekko, is not 'made' but merely transferred to those who have the 'stuff' he has, the same 'stuff' he professes to see in young Fox. He will, of course, betray his naive protege when and if ....<br /><br />It's the superb acting of Douglas and Sheen, and the taut directing of Oliver Stone, that make this film hugely successful as drama. Whether it fairly represents the ethical morass of high finance in America and the deplorable failure of American ideals, or rather unfairly caricatures the wizards of Wall Street who revitalized American business, has been a point of controversy ever since the film first appeared. Critics have derided Oliver Stone as a lefty extremist pursuing an anti-capitalist agenda. There ough to be a \\"viewers' discretion\\" warning on this film, I think; if all you know about the stock market is what you hear on TV and radio talk shows, you really aren't qualified to judge it except as entertainment. And believe me, it is entertaining.<br /><br />Some of the people involved in making the film have asserted that Gekko's character was based on the real-life figure of Michael Milken, the Junk Bond KIng, who was convicted of securities fraud as a result of an investigation of insider trading in 1989. Other candidates for the prototype of Gekko include the disgraced Ivan Boesky, who delivered a famous speech extolling Greed at UC Berkeley in 1986 and who lived by that ideal to the hilt. It happens that I knew Michael Milken personally for a while; he was the close kin of an in-law of my wife. His family and my wife's family had been going to each other's Bar Mitzvahs for decades. Michael Milken was formidably quick-minded and cool-headed about greed, but he was neither as handsome nor as steely-blue menacing as Gekko. As a study of financial concupiscence, however, Gekko could well represent Milken.<br /><br />And now? Gordon Gekko has remained an iconic figure, such a plausible portrayal of the archetypal Wall Streeter that many people think the film was based on true-life events.

030726999X|5.0|Having read the author's previous two books, I was very curious as to how he would resolve all of the issues raised in them. I really enjoyed Mr. Larsson's style of writing. He draws you in, in spite of yourself. Some nights, I would read until my eyes crossed because I could not put this book down! He is masterful at suspense! There was a bit more detail in the beginning of this book because he doubled back to give you background on SAPO; how it came about and who was involved. Once you are engaged, the ending comes too quickly as with the previous two books but Mr. Larsson was masterful at tying up all of the loose ends and leaving no questions unanswered.
B001684L0A|5.0|I bought this blu ray not expecting much, but ending up really enjoying it.  There are 8 episodes which doesn't seem like much, but the episodes are over an hour each.  I ended up learning alot about early American history.  John Adam's life was very interesting and I never would have known about it if I hadn't seen the movie.  This goes on sale every-once-in-awhile so keep an eye out.
B003Q6D2BE|4.0|RED<br /><br />STARRING: Bruce Willis, Mary-Louise Parker, John Malkovich, Karl Urban, Helen Mirren, Morgan Freeman, Richard Dreyfuss, Brian Cox, Rebecca Pidgeon and Julian McMahon<br /><br />WRITTEN BY: Jon Hoeber and Erich Hoeber; based on the graphic novel by Warren Ellis and Cully Hamner<br /><br />DIRECTED BY: Robert Schwentke<br /><br />Rated: PG - 13<br />Genre: Action / Comedy<br />Release Date: 15 October 2010<br />Review Date: 08 November 2010<br /><br />Recently numerous movies have shown us great actors can make ridiculous material wildly entertaining. MacGruber, Machete and now Red have all been absurdly obnoxious, but their cast has kept them in the realm of the best films of 2010.<br /><br />Let's start with THEE action star himself, Bruce Willis. Surprisingly enough, he's not a cop this time! He's Frank Moses, an ex CIA operative being hunted down by a league of bad guys who make Swiss cheese out of his house via machineguns. Naturally Frank walks away unscathed and we are left wondering: who would send so many dudes to shoot up a house rather than just one to blow it up?<br /><br />The answer to that is found in Red's tone, which is: because it looks cooler. The charm of Red is that it knows it's absurd but it wants to be, and it also knows how to be absurd but cleverly entertaining at the same time. Oh, and if you are wondering why it's called Red, well that stands for Retired Extremely Dangerous; see what I mean?<br /><br />Frank has been flirting over the phone with a phone operator named Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker) and in doing so does two things an action hero can never do without serious consequences: he speaks on an unsecured line and he falls in love with a beautiful woman whom the bad guys will inevitably capture and hold at bay.<br /><br />This happens of course, but it's not the chain of events that holds our attention, so much as the journey we take with the characters in getting to those must-have action moments. For instance, not having time to explain that more bad guys are about to break down her door and kill her, Frank kidnaps Sarah; and this is their first meet I might add. Then they head off on an amusing road trip in search of assistance and information from a league of Frank's old counterparts who include Morgan Freeman, John Malkovich and Helen Mirren.<br /><br />Next to the gnarly bad-ass-ness that is Bruce Willis in anything he does - the Malkovich character was my favorite. Malkovich plays Marvin Boggs, a paranoid gun toting hermit who lives in a kind of underground fall out shelter, accessed only by - well, I can't reveal that; it's too funny and I've said too much already. Just know that you will love Malkovich's off the wall and canny portrayal, and that he gets 90 percent of the laughs.

B001TH8UUA|5.0|You can't beat the price of these cables. After using them for a couple of months, I have not complaints. They work just as well as more expensive cables I'm using. I will buy more of these in the future without hesitation.
0061706620|3.0|I bought this because I am a Supernatural Superfan.  It is interesting if you want to know more about specific episodes of the series.  More people should read this, especially the John Winchester bashers.  This book gives great insight into this poor man's struggles.  He did do the best he could.  Great beginnings of the Winchester story.  They should've used some of the this stuff in the show.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I posted a review an hour after receiving the album, giving it 3 star, which I deleted later, this is my review today, one month after the release, and all I can say is, this is his best, it grows on me and it is THIS good    I can not find a word to describe this album, the closest one may be sadness, it is really sad, to be honest, from Bells of NYC, Galileo, Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi to one of the most poignant songs ever written War at Home    For this album, I don't even need to look at the lyrics to feel it, the arrangement of orchestra in the background in many songs is just brilliant, combined with beautiful piano, provide such a feeling that surpasses everything
B0000640SA|1.0|They make it impossible to access the tracks on the second disc.  A code is needed that you, the viewer, don't have!  The film is presented in reverse order and it is extremely confusing.  I watched the film at least 5 times and enjoyed it less each time.  Don't waste your time!  I loaned it to a friend for a second opinion. when I get it back I will trash the DVD.
B002SAUCBC|5.0|Today's writers are at a marked disadvantage because of Mister King.  Simply put, no one tells a story quite like him.  This story is phenomenal.  I had never heard of it, and stumbled upon it when looking for \\"just about anything\\" to download.  I asked my King-expert friend if he had read it, and he hadn't.  I am very glad that I did.  The beginning of the book doesn't make much sense, King hints at things, and writes as if we already know what is happening. But he withholds the truth from us long enough to formulate a guess or two.  I had my own \\"is (x) what's going on here?\\" thoughts, and then when (x) happened, I wished I had been wrong.  There is something simply dark, and truly mesmerizing about this novel.  Highly recommended.
B000ICL3KG|5.0|The scientists are warning the world. Al Gore is their voice. Even if you don't care for Mr. Gore, you should appreciate knowing the true facts about what is happening to destroy our planet. Greed, and lack of concern are the root cause. The average citizens are helpless...Only our leaders have the power to make laws and force corporate change. The world's future is in their hands. Are they even concerned?
B000F8O35U|5.0|This video was sent to arrive two days earlier than expected and was in great condition.  I would definitely purchase here again.
B0010VXMVM|5.0|What an incredible story!  It left me with such a wonderful feeling that I wanted to watch it again!  I LOVED it.  I'm going to buy more then one copy so that I have a back up!  I will be watching this over and over.  It's absolutely Fantastic!!
B001MYIXAC|5.0|This is one of the most mesmerizing films I have ever watched.  This is said to be the Best vampire movie ever.  I have not seen them all, but it is the best I have seen.  Eli smells like death, her hair has never seen a comb, she is impervise to the cold,and bare foot she leaves no tracks in the snow.  Oskar falls in love with her and I did too!  Lina Landersson, 11 years old when the film was made, is an amazing actress.  As delicate, haunting, and poetic a film as you're ever bound to see!  Get this DVD and enjoy!
0553805371|3.0|The authors claim science can answer both the how and why questions concerning the behavior of the universe without the need to invoke a god. Hawking and Mlodinow explore the fascinating and counterintuitive world of quantum physics to make their point. They conclude that M-theory is the most promising candidate for the elusive theory of everything. This is actually not a single theory but a collection of theories with each describing a particular aspect of the universe. The authors write with wit, which makes for an enjoyable read. However, their main thesis is not clearly threaded throughout the book. This creates a disjointed narrative. The chapters do not seem to build upon each other to create a focused argument for their thesis. A nice read, but I often lost track of the main point of the book.
B001H9MYPW|5.0|In Treatment is a great show, and Season 2 was my favorite. The acting is incredible! You find yourself pulled into the characters lives, and you feel their emotions with them.    Definitely a must see!
B000AJIF4E|5.0|It is clear that these headphones are high quality. They have a nice sturdy feel, as well as a nice weight. The sound is beautifully clear. The cord length and design is also great.<br /><br />The only problem I had initially was that, if I wore them long enough, they would really make the edges of my ears hurt. It might just be because my ears are larger than usual. In any case, once I used them enough, it went away.
1439133948|3.0|I am a huge fan of Ms. Bujold's Vorkosigan books.  I reread the entire series about every 2 years and seem to find something I may have missed.  The details of the characters, the density of the scenes, the humor and the concepts that make me go \\"hmmm...\\" have been a long time source of enjoyment.  This book did not meet the standard.  I liked it and was glad that I purchased the book but part of me was disappointed.  It seemed more like an expanded short story (not as disappointing as Irresistible Forces) and lacking in detail.  The Manic Miles that I have come to know was not there.  I know he had to grow up sometime but to be so...boring?  It felt like she didn't want to write the book but was giving in to fan/publisher pressure and was depressed about it.  To console myself after reading, I revisited A Civil Campaign.  The Aftermaths section seemed disjointed and weird.    Read the book but you might try the library before you buy.  If she does write another Vorkosigan book, I hope she enjoys revisiting her characters more.
B000005JFG|5.0|In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|I  love this music from Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band. Clarence Clemons plays on the sax. Danny Federici  plays the keyboard.  Steven Van Zandt plays guitar and does background vocals.  Max Weinberg provides a great beat on the drums.  They form the nucleus of the E Street Band.  They are such talented musicians. They compliment each other so well. These songs came out in 1978. I know some of these songs, but a few of these songs I haven't heard before so they are new to me.<br /><br />  My favorite track is the title cut.  \\"The Promise\\" is a tribute to all the working people out there.  \\"It's A Shame\\" is a song about working hard and feeling under appreciated. \\"Because The Night\\" is a song that has been covered by other artists, but no one does it better than the E Street Band.  This song is very romantic.  I love the sax playing by Clarence on this tune.  My other track is \\"Racing In The Street\\".  This song is about the  adventure and allure of racing in the street.  I like the harmonica playing by Bruce and the keyboard playing by the late Danny Federici. \\"Fire\\" is another song I grew up listening to.  Bruce's vocals are very sensual on this song.  \\"Spanish Eyes\\" is a great song about a man  being captivated by a beautiful woman.  This is a very pretty song.<br />\\"Aint Good Enough For You\\" is a tune that puts me in a good mood.  It is very upbeat and one of my favorites.  This song is about the difficulty of being in a relationship with a woman.  I love the slower tempo of the track \\"City Of Night\\".  This is the perfect song to relax to after a long hard day. \\"Gotta Get That Feeling\\" is a song about trying to recapture a passion for life.  The musicial arrangements on this song are excellent.  \\"Save My Love\\" is a sweet love song.  I love Bruce's tender vocals on the song \\"The Broken Hearted\\". \\"Outside Looking In\\" is a song about feels like to be an outsider. \\"Come On Let's Go Tonight\\" is a short slower tempo song that I love.  All these songs are superb.
B0013FSL0C|5.0|The acting is incredible, and the characters are so realistic. The emotions are raw, and you find yourself completely pulled into the stories.
B003XRDYX2|5.0|Look, this is a great set of albums, and regardless of the ultimate \\"sound quailty\\" these are albums that everyone should be knowledgable about. The mono and stero mixes arn't really all that different when it comes to the early albums exept that they split up the things Bob was playing. The later albums are really where you can hear the difference. Its really a superb collection and if you don't own any of these and your a Dylan fane then you should have already bought these rather then checking out this review.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I originally considered just buying the DVD, The Promise, after all, I already had the CD of Darkness At The Edge Of Town. How much was a remaster really going to change it? Then I realized how much new music from the original sessions was included and I had to spring for the whole package. Who would want to miss songs from that era? DAET has long been my favorite Springsteen record. I love it's wall-to-wall noir element, the quality of the writing, the continually ominous interaction of the bass and the bass drum. I'm a all-record fan, but driving to work I turn most often to this record.<br /><br />There are a number of features about this reissue that improve on other important reissues which undoubtedly, Springsteen and his colleagues bought and noted. The packaging is spectacular. It's a lot like Bob Dylan's Scrapbook, in that it's a reproduction of Springsteen's notebook in which he wrote the songs that make up this record. Unlike the Dylan book, though, it contains 3 CDs and 3 DVDs all from that era, so if you're nostalgic for 1970s Bruce, this content is spine tingling. The remastering, unlike the Beatles box set from last year, and The Rolling Stones remaster of Exiles on Main Street earlier this year, sit quite comfortably on your iPod next to the original recordings. They don't replace your older recordings as the Beatles' and Stones' work did.<br /><br />If you love Bruce Springsteen, I would tell you not to hesitate to spend the extra money for this box set. It's hours of infotainment. In most cases, you just have to have it.<br /><br />If you're someone who looks at Springsteen as a major mover of the rock idiom and is simply interested in how someone like this works, this is s seminal document. Not only do you have the original, hand written lyrics, but Springsteen has made copious notes and essays explaining his process and his thoughts, the driving factors in his life and thinking that created this particular record. This is not someone speculating about how Springsteen may have come up with these ideas. We've all read those, right? This is Springsteen himself telling you how it was. Spine tingling!<br /><br />I intended to watch television last night, but spent the entire evening perusing these pages while some of my favorite music of all time played in 3 dimensional remastered stereo.<br /><br />It was a wonderful experience. The original record, remastered, absolutely pops off the stereo. The additional tracks have not been given the same level of remastering, but what's fascinating about them, is how Springsteen used elements of this music which did not find it's way onto the original pressing, in future records. There are lyrics that were released later at a completely different rhythm and melody, and there are melodies and rhythms that he used later with completely different lyrics.<br /><br />I'm fascinated and honestly, I haven't scratched the surface.<br /><br />If you care even just about this style of music, this is the best tutorial on how it's created from the ground up. No reason to hesitate. Absolutely worth the extra cash.ay have come up with these ideas. We've all read those, right? This is Springsteen himself telling you how it was. Spine tingling!

B0025UHKNS|1.0|I got it in late April, and it started having batter issues a few months later. It's advertised to have 8 hr work out time. I would usually get low battery warning after ~4-5 hours, and the unit will turn off. This last weekend I fully charged it, ran for 3.5 hrs on Sat, then ran for 1 mile on Mon evening, and it's dead. At this point I'm not confident I can use it for a full marathon. Edit: it got worse, this past weekend I ran for 8.6 miles, rested a day, kep the GPS off, then went for another run, the battery showed 67% before I started, but it died 2 miles into the run.    I've tried suggestion from Garmin online forum, hard reset the unit, completely drain the battery then charge to 100%, nothing solved this issue. Many users on Garmin's forum had this issue, and all Garmin does is to ask you to contact support, which then requires you to pay to ship the unit back to get it fixed/replaced. It's unacceptable for such a wide-spread issue that is not caused by any user mis-use. If it's a software issue, fix it. If it's bad hardware, do a recall. I've been a happy Garmin Forerunner user with 2 previous usits (301 and 205), but really disappointed with the 405CX.    I will for sure not purchase another Garmin GPS from Amazon since Amazon's return policy will run out before you run into these issues.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|Everyone knows what the show is about. A plane crashes on a strange island. Over 40 survivors, who struggle to stay alive and understand the mysterious events occurring. Is it an accident that they survived and met, or is it fate? Who are the strange Others who were there first? What is the Monster lurking in the jungle? As the series progressed through 6 seasons, many plots were resolved, but others were left open to interpretation or bogged down in inconsistencies. The producers admit they prioritized the character over plot resolution.  The scenery is gorgeous, the soundtrack is amazing. The acting is mostly of a high standard. The final season was a bit of a mess, so I'd give it 8.5/10 because of that.     I chose to buy the USA set as opposed to the UK set because it just looks so much better. The UK set is just individual seasons stuck together. This set is a work of art. The outer box looks like a memorial to the plane crash victims. Within is the main box, which is textured to feel like the Egyptian stone it looks like. Within the dvds are in lovely card wallets, and there are several extra goodies to find. Each season has lots of extra documentaries and comments from directors and actors. Set is 9.5/10. Not 10/10 because it is a bit big and awkward to open and handle.
B003NWS5AO|1.0|Robert Plant made his millions and amassed fans via Led Zeppelin. He was a musical genius.  Then he abandoned his fan base and decided to make foo foo music.   Now he wants to peddle a Glee CD. Glee music is any music that has people singing someone else s songs.  You certainly don't see Paul McCartney turning his back on his fans.  He has continued to have issues with the other Zep band members that have kept them from touring. John's son is ready to play drums, Jimmie is ready to play guitar and John Paul is ready on base, but where is Robert? Oh yeah, he drifts along selling ticky tacky music.  Robert: You have turned your back on your fan base. Shame on you.   You have become a hippy Perry Como...
B004BSAPRK|5.0|I have been waiting for this album to come out for quite some time now and it was worth the wait. There are so many different styles on this album and so many great songs with single potential. Of course there are a few I don't like as much as others but overall I love this album. Rihanna is always changing no album is like the past and thats why I love her.
B000TENKV8|5.0|Just got this and \\"She Hangs Brightly.\\" Can't believe I waited this long to check this band out.  Every track is excellent and warrants repeat listening. A very chill album.

He was an armed robber and a heroin addict, when he escaped from prison in the early 80's, with his fake passport in hand. Shantaram, is the Hindu name given to the narrator; it means \\"Man of God's peace\\".  Throughout the novel, the narrator is also called Lin or Linbaba, a name given to him by a street guide who took a liking to him. Traveling through New Zealand, the narrator ends up in Bombay, and this novel incorporates the story of his life, and the ten years he spent in hiding in India. In Bombay he lives in a slum, founded a medical clinic to treat the poor for free, he joined the local mafia headed by Abdel Khader Khan, who helps this man on the run. Although most of his time is spent in India, his time on the lam had him fighting with the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan, and he also found time to fall in love.<br /><br />The book is full of colorful characters: Prabaker, the Indian street guide who takes a liking to Lin.  Karla Saarenen, a Swiss-American woman who is running from a troubled past.  Other characters include Quasim Ali, head of the slum, and let me not forget, Johnny Cigar.  There was so much to love about this 933 page book (I also had the unabridged audio which was fantastic). This story has it all --intrigue, corruption, misery, humor, joy, pain and love. The writing is outstanding. As the narrator tells his story, he does so in such a way that  you find yourself stopping to think and reflect about the way he has expressed complex emotional issues. Some of  the scenes that took place in prison made me cringe, and yet they seem very realistic.  In the end I felt like I had a much better understanding of the complexities of society in India in the 1980's.  The ending was perfect, in my opinion. I could envision a sequel or a movie in the horizon.<br /><br />In real life, the author was recaptured and ordered to serve out the remainder of his nineteen year prison term. It was in prison that he wrote this novel. It took him thirteen years to write this as his first two drafts had been destroyed while he was serving his sentence.<br /><br />I selected a few favorite passages that really made an impact on me......<br /><br />  \\"Fate gives all of us three teachers, three friends, three enemies and three great loves in our lives. But these twelve are always disguised, and we can never know which one is which until we've loved them, left them, or fought them.\\"<br /><br />  \\"I clench my teeth against the stars. I closed my eyes. I surrendered to sleep. One of the reasons why we crave love, and seek it so desperately, is that love is the only cure for loneliness, and shame, and sorrow. But some feelings sink so deep into the heart that only loneliness can help you find them again. Some of the truths about yourself are so painful that only shame can help you live with them.

B00316DDUE|5.0|with little expectations about it, my father in law introduced me to the DVD version of this concert, and i was immediately blown away! it was so fun to watch it, the songs were a display of talent, where every musician had a solo time somewhere along the concert. The visuals and lasers and camera play are proof of a good design of the show, and the following edition of the footage for the dvd. The video is very high quality, but i wanted to wait for it to come out on Blu-ray to get it, so I did. The sound and picture was even better than the DVD. There is a couple of songs that are rather boring compared to the rest, but you will really enjoy this concert! You'll see what I mean!
B0041T4ML4|4.0|Some books make you think, imagine another world based on our own, and then spin a gripping yarn around it. This is such a book. Living as we do in the world of Expansion, I had to come to grips with the world of Contraction ... and how we got there. When the world is again manually powered and genetic engineering has sprung a leak, just getting by is a challenge in the heat of Thailand. Windup Girl was a great read but the extensive use of Thai was a challenge to plow through in the beginning. Over all, it's an easy book to recommend for anyone enjoying well written scifi about a future dystopia.

B003PPDBQ2|5.0|Lupton's sister is a deeply moving exploration of sisterly attachment. I think writing it as a mystery was just right and it was a fun read as well. I strongly disagree with the person who said the ending was a cop out. It is surprising and jarring and took me a bit to re-think things from a new perspective but as a study of sister psychology it was brilliant. Her observations about the tiny emotional pieces that make up one sisters connection to the other and the way she ties that in with the genetic theme of the book was stunning. A must read.
B002TZS5GU|4.0|Compared to 28 Days Later or I am Legion, Carriers is not much of a horror film. There isn't much gore, not a lot of scary monsters chasing people. Rather the monsters are those few people who are left after a virus with a 100% kill rate has raced through the world like wildfire. Among the survivors are 4 young people, whose only goal is to get to the beach, the place where they were happy as children. Along the way, they have to overcome the problems that would arise with a worldwide epidemic--no gas, no electricity, infected people who are not yet dead, and so forth.<br /><br />Where the film shines is in the relationships between the 4 kids, two brothers and their girlfriends. They are all well-drawn, complex characters with complex interactions. Their fear of being infected is matched by their fear that their moral sense has been distorted, that the will to survive has transformed them from good people into craven, immoral ghosts of their former selves. And this is very well done.<br /><br />If you're expecting a loud monster movie with lots of chases and zombies, this isn't it. If you want to see 4 heartwrenchingly normal young people trying to deal with mortality and what it takes to survive, this is a very satisfying, if haunting movie.

B003XWEQ1G|4.0|More an origin story that a traditional Robin Hood tale, Ridley Scott's version of the legend gives us Russell Crowe as an overtly-masculine Robin Hood, sans tights of course. No Errol Flynn or even Kevin Costner here; this Robin Hood is dark (sometimes bleak in fact), always serious, and rarely fun. Having said that, it's still a good film and worth the time investment.<br /><br />The story begins before the beginning, with 'Robin Longstride' fighting in Richard the Lionheart's army, and only towards the end of the film do we begin to recognize elements of the usual Robin Hood tale. Familiar characters appear (sometimes briefly), but the main story focuses on Robin's relationships with his men, and his future father-in-law (a superb Max Von Sydow). Cate Blanchett is Marian (the \\"maid\\" title has been dropped), her strength of character and earthiness a welcome change from 'Maid Marians' of past films.<br /><br />Ridley Scott's last couple of epic films haven't found large audiences like 2000's 'Gladiator', but this film deserves a wider audience and shows that there are still directors interested in making thoughtful, intelligent large-scale films. Kudos to Russell Crowe for sharing the spotlight with an excellent ensemble cast, and for showing us another, deeper side of this legendary hero.

1439153663|1.0|What an absolutely horrendous waste of ink and paper. The writing is risibly bad, the characters absurd, the dialect insulting, the plot so thin and obvious as to be nonexistent. The first chapter wouldn't make it past the MOST amateur writing group. Show not tell, maybe? As a very small start. Pages and pages of dense, bad, painful, non-scenes. Actually astonishing.    An absolute embarrassment. Most disturbing is that S&S published this crap, when many very good writers scratch at the door. Who on earth did this woman blow?    Utterly, unbearably AWFUL. (INFURIATINGLY AWFUL. Throw it from a very high place awful. If you can get high enough.)
B0043A0PXU|2.0|I have to agree with Christmas Gal's review. After listening to her cd I actually did a web search to see if something had happened to Annie's voice. It sounds shrill, grating and forced. And don't get me wrong, I love Annie Lennox's voice...or at least used to. What were once smooth and calming vocals now sound harsh. Her forced vibrato is especially annoying.     I would have much preferred her voice from classics like Into the West, Why, No More I Love You's, etc.     Either her voice is gone or this is some of the worst production values ever done on an Annie Lennox release.
0439023513|3.0|If your teenager is reading this book, please, read this review.    It's difficult to write a review without spoilers but I wish I had read something to prepare me for this ending.     This book is much darker than the other two.  Although, they all deal with violent material to be discussed with your teenager.  In this final book, I believe that Ms. Collins intentions are fully realized, to make you feel the complete damage that war can do  to a soldier.   The hopelessness that a person can be left with.  Having said that, I know veterans that have come back from war and have made  successful, happy lives.  Many soldiers are able to find happiness again and are able to heal.  This book is not a testimony to that kind of process.  This book takes you on a horrific journey to feel our beloved Mockingjay become a hollow version of herself, climaxing without her ever really growing into a hero with any passion for a cause for freedom,  and then it cuts you off from any kind of a journey of healing.  Mockingjay really feels like a commentary about those soldiers drafted into war by hate, anger, or fear and  that are so damaged  they barely learn to live again, and will never feel joy or peace.  I'm not sure Ms. Collins was trying to make political statements about war, as some have said, but for a teenager to read this without having a balanced discussion about war, could be very easily construed as propaganda.  I recommend you read this book with your child, or in the very least, discuss it with them.  Whatever your views on war, it is an opportunity to have a serious discussion about it.

B003IVDPC8|5.0|If it's possible for two master singer/song-writers and friends of 40 years to make sweeter music they ever before, James Taylor and Carole King hit that high note in \\"Live at the Troubadour.\\"  When I downloaded the tracks to \\"Live @\\" and had my 1st listen, it stopped me in my tracks.  I started hearing songs by two old friends who sang the soundtrack of my life. It was a reunion of sorts. While I'm too young to have been a period fan, the fact that I am a guitarist who plays many of JT's tunes makes a difference.  I gigged in DC and Boston to help pay for grad school.<br /><br />I started writing a letter to Matt-guy with whom I played in a duo long ago. After rereading the letter today-still makes me smile. As I listened, I started writing. Each tune has a place in our history. As I wrote-I realized I was-adding lyrics of these song the I sang we sang.<br /><br /> Simple gifts indeed from two good friends. As the Washington Post Reviewer said of their DC concert \\"not even DuPont could make better chemistry.\\"  An enduring performance from two of the best.
B003YNFYCO|3.0|Looks like the EMI group is at it again! The beatles have and always will be this greedy music group's meal ticket and the timing is just right to plunder these recorded treasures for the holiday season. There is no doubt that the beatles music is timeless but that does'nt mean you keep releasing the same sets many times over, especially if it has less to do with the music and more to do with clever engineers. The first time this set was released in 1973 beatle fans rejoiced because of the scars that was left behind of the band's breakup two years's prior,this along with the \\"blue\\" album became instant classics. Both sets  introduced the fab four to a whole new generation while reminding  original fans how brilliant the beatles were mistakes and all, original mono and stereo pressings furthur illustrated how the band and producer George martin skillfully used  what technology was avalible at the time. From the \\"split down the middle\\"  stereo recordings of the earlier music to the more adventurous soundscapes of the later years the beatles were always ahead of the game, keep in mind that all of this was accomplished during the analog age! If you already have this set(especially in record form) don't waste your money unless you just have to have everything or you're a tecnical scholar of some sort, i promise no remastered version outside of analog is gonna properly present this great music the way it was ment to be heard. With all of that said there are two 2 exceptions: LET IT BE NAKED and the remastered YELLOW SUBMARINE SOUNDTRACK. why? Because these are the only discs that add great sound quality while perserving the original feel of those recordings.
B00275EHJG|1.0|Had reasonable expectations for this movie and it was not worth the time it took to watch it. My 6 year old got scared and sad when the bear turned sinister.I couldn't quite get past the scary doll either. So we stopped the movie and explained that some people who write movies have their own issues and sad lives. We played and found something else that was happy. Somehow this one slipped past the people who know how to qualify movies for kids and it lost the entertainment value completely. Some writer needs to see a shrink. The only valuable part of this movie was with Bonnie at the end. This movie was very stressful to watch, even for me, when I skimmed the rest of it in another room. Kids don't want to be scared or stressed out. Their toys are supposed to be safe and fun, not morph into monsters when the lights go out. They blew it on this one!!!  Thank goodness we preview via redbox before we buy. Not for kids!!! (may have some value in a psychology class some day...)You know, the end does not justify the means.  Stick to the good stuff like \\"Incredibles, Up, How to train your dragon(our new favorite), Arthur, and Spirit!!!\\"
0374158460|4.0|Yes, I realize that this book was over-hyped, and is bound to leave some Readers disappointed. It is, however, for the most part an excellent read, very satisfying, more ambitious than \\"The Corrections\\" and tighter. It is consistently both entertaining and thought-provoking. Many, many parts of the book are finely observed & resonated personally with me, and I was in a rush to finish it. Definitely a major work of fiction by one of our finest authors. Highly recommended.<br /><br />The action is centered on an American family, Patty, her husband Walt, Walt's best friend Richard, Patty and Walt's son Joey, and their inevitable entanglements. As the title suggests, Franzen has some larger themes in mind as well, sexual freedom, artistic freedom, the freedom of the marketplace to dictate societal mores. He doesn't hammer away at any of these -- well, sex is a big area of concern to Patty who has never been very turned on by Walt -- it's not \\"The Brothers Karamazov,\\" but the burden (and luxury) of these freedoms all but break the backs of the main characters. It is not just a simple family saga, tackling these larger themes in a thoroughly engaging and entertaining way.<br /><br />What I would like to add that other reviewers neglected, especially to some who failed to enjoy the book as much as I did, that I think there is something going on here with \\"War and Peace,\\" which is mentioned at key points several times in the story. What I think distinguishes [[ASIN:0345472403 War and Peace (Modern Library Classics)]] from the Great American Novels is that the Russian characters in Tolstoy's epic experience fundamental, transformative changes in personality and outlook. This transformation occurs in Tolstoy under the influence of the extraordinary circumstances in which his characters find themselves. This sort of fundamental & personal transformation is largely absent from American literature, where, instead, the characters are often either redeemed in some fashion (Redemption is really our major theme) or tend to grow and ripen around some set of core of values, set in motion in the Land of Opportunity & under the influence of American social fluidity. I think what Patty and Walt endure is intended to be transformational in the way Pierre & Natasha are changed by the extraordinary series events they live through during the war with Napoleon, and we are to take that transformation of Walt and Patty in \\"Freedom\\" at face value, a la Tolstoy. (There is even a war going on, the one in Iraq, but these are events occurring in the background, which is fitting since, with one notable exeption, no one was wreaking destruction hereabouts on native territory during that unfortunate episode in our history.) The way the narrative structure in \\"Freedom\\" bounces back and forth among the major characters also echoes Tolstoy's technique in \\"War and Peace.\\" It is subtle, but I have the sense that Tolstoy is an important influence here.<br /><br />Transformation is quite an unusual literary statement from an American novelist, In contrast, Richard is ultimately redeemed from his nihilism in a much more conventional fashion - by the way, he is far and away the sharpest drawn character in book, the prose positively crackles whenever we are inside his head. And Patty's college-age son Joey similarly manages to survive his encounter with the contemporary culture of greed in the usual bildungsroman narrative arc. These are treated as minor episodes, compared to the cataclysmic changes that Patty and Walt undergo. And I am not sure Franzen is completely successful, either, but that flaw may be ours as readers, though, just as the coincidences that are used to stitch together the plots of great 19th century novels look artificial to modern eyes. Nevertheless, here is a book that weaves together some thoughtful and relevant ideas the author has about the human condition and the way we have \\"chosen\\" to live today.<br /><br />America as the \\"Land of Opportunity\\"is still featured in the works of recent arrivals to our shores (e.g., \\"The Namesake\\"), but for those of us who are several generations into the American experience, the frontier has long since been explored and the promise of \\"The Great Society\\" looks increasingly hollow againtst a self-indulgent age of consumerism that is our legacy to our children of affluence. The larger point I believe Franzen is making here is that here at the End of History and up against the Limits of Growth, there is an abundance of freedom, yet many of the choices we have the luxury of exercising lead away from fulfillment (both personal and societal) to personal tragedy, nihilism, or worse.of recent arrivals to our shores (e.g., \\"The Namesake\\"), but for those of us who are several generations into the American experience, the frontier has long since been explored and the promise of \\"The Great Society\\" looks increasingly hollow againtst a self-indulgent age of consumerism that is our legacy to our children of affluence.

B0040JHWKS|4.0|The average hardcore Springsteen fan has been waiting for the Darkness on the Edge of town anniversary box ever since the spectacular Born to Run release five years back. Speculations of what should or should not be included had many of them frothing at the mouth. Imagine the mess some made when the box included (almost) everything that was on their collective wish list (they're a hard to please lot). In all honesty, that box is how these things should be done. Take note Mick Jagger because this one really has the works, a re-master, outtakes, full documentaries and live shows from back in the day. In short no overpriced teasers like on the Exile on Mainstreet boxed set. In comparison the box comes for a very reasonable price to boot. Five stars and then some for the full package.     The problem with the Promise as a single release however is that it doesn't really work as a stand alone album as Springsteen promised it would. In the media blitz Springsteen has referred to the Promise as the album Darkness could have become, implying that the Promise is every bit as good as the classic album he released in '78. Unfortunately that promise fails to some extent. Mind you, the album has some great outtakes and a few very nice alternative versions to songs that made the album, but it doesn't make for a classic like Darkness undeniably is.    Two things prohibit it from being exactly what the promotional push promises. Firstly, while many of these songs are excellent, they are missing the angst and the desperate hope that made Darkness on the Edge off Town so compelling. Second, a lot of the tracks, that could have made this a worthy stand alone album, were released on later albums such as the River and Tracks. Many of whom were of high quality. Not everything on the Promise reaches that same high quality level. Most notably the alternate versions of Factory and Candy's Room, represented here as Come On (let's go tonight) and Candy's Boy. But a few other ballads just kindof drag along as well without ever really sticking. Mostly because they still feel somewhat unfinished. As a result the 21 tracks on the Promise make a somewhat uneven whole. It is a great collection of outtakes, simply not a unified album.     As a collection of outtakes however, there is much to enjoy. The stronger material on the Promise makes this a release that the casual fan could also very much enjoy. In that sense I think it is a commendable and smart move that the material is available outside of the pricier deluxe box. We finally have finished versions of Because the Night and Fire. While both enjoyed better versions by respectively Patti Smith or Robert Gordon you can't help but wonder how big of a hit they could have been for the Boss himself. Similarly with the excellent Talk to Me that went up on South Side Johnny's classic album. For years fans have yearned for Springsteen originals and they do not disappoint.     Among the unknown tracks there are more than a few that would have warranted an official by any other artist. If the album would have been condensed to one disc this would, with some of the earlier released songs such as Point Blank or Sherry Darling thrown in, this would have been a great album by any standard. Springsteen proves with this set of outtakes just how well he could write genre pieces. The British invasion passes briefly on the excellent Outside Looking In, but even more than that this record pays homage to the great American song writers such as Goffin and King, Leiber and Stoller and of course Phil Spector. They are represented in gorgeous ballads such as Someday (we'll be together), newly finished pieces like Save My Love or a rave up like Ain't Good Enough for you. Even though the promise never really becomes an actually album with a beginning and end (let alone A side or B side bookends) it certainly is a very enjoyable grab bag  of outtakes that most fans will enjoy.[[ASIN:B0040JHXTI The Promise: The Darkness On The EdgeOf Town Story (3 CD/3 DVD)]]
B003TVMIDO|5.0|The music is remastered. This collection sounds better and clearer than the earlier remixes. The remasters are not a loud as the previous remix collection, which is truer to Lennon's original tapes. The music sounds great. Listen to the remasters closely and you'll notice that the tinge of distortion that sits on top of remixes' sound is now gone. The dynamics are now punchier and more distinct, which is more satisfying to the ear whether you notice it or not. I appreciate Yoko releasing this collections all at once and not dragging out the releases dates over a period of months.<br />I will keep my remix collection but I will listen to the remasters.
B0038Z5T4Q|5.0|Stone has made a sequel to his modern classic film. Before watching the new one, I wanted to remind myself of the old one.<br /> It is as fresh as ever. Gordon Gekko is a treasure trove of wise statements on the nature of capitalism. His speech to the shareholder assembly where he attacks the thieving management is brilliant and I never heard a better version of combining satire and serious analysis.<br />We all know the famous quote `Greed is good', but there is much more in it. I have never heard, so far, any voice that claimed that Gekko is not speaking plain, if self-serving truth. He is the personified damnation of a whole `profession': the locust in human shape. While nobody in his right mind will deny that the financial sector as a whole has an important part to play in modern society, it is equally obvious that Gekko's special branch of the financial industry is entirely destructive. It does not contribute, it is not after `win-win' situations, and it is pure robbery and warfare. Its philosophy is solidly based on zero sums: what we gain is your loss. Be a man and live with it!<br /><br />The usual argument in defense of these predators is that they play a sanitary role in keeping economic evolution healthy, in the way lions keep antelope herds fit and healthy. Of course there is a grain of truth in that, one can't deny that investment bankers are able to scare the living daylight out of thieving managements. But more often than doing good, these two bunches of criminals will gang up and siphon the juice out of honest shareholders and the work force. Whatever happened to the sane if illusionary concept of stakeholder interest? At about the time of Wall Street, in the best Reagan years, it got totally bowled out of the arena by a deceptive version of shareholder interest, whereby the robber barons assume the speaker role for all shareholders, the majority of whom is not able to follow the process and gets shortchanged.<br /><br />Of course in comparison to their successors in the 3rd millennium, good old Gekko's world during the Reagan years was nearly idyllic.<br /><br />(this review refers only to the film, not to this specific DVD)3rd millennium, good old Gekko's world during the Reagan years was nearly idyllic.

0060920084|2.0|Why is it that so many travel writers pretend that travelling and writing is the last thing they want to do? and that everywhere they visit  they would prefer to be sitting at home, eating only familiar food and meeting only people they already know and understand well.<br />  I was told Bill Bryson was a gifted, lucid writer, but I am hoping this my first introduction to him was far from his best.  He keeps acting like someone is forcing him to travel through small-town America and endure the culture shock (he is from Iowa, but would very much prefer to be in England) and constantly complains of the small-town Americans as uncultured, overfed boors.  Now, I dont disagree entirely with his view of country folk - but that is how country folk are in nearly every country in the world, and Americans are actually friendlier and more open-minded than in many other countries I have visited.<br />  He also exaggerates his feeling out-of-place, suggesting that, for instance, unkempt Northerners like himself might get beaten up in the (prejudiced, obviously) South.  Since I - a dark-skinned Indian - have driven through remote parts of the South and Texas - about the same time as Bryson did , this seems especially silly.<br />  Where he might provide some insight into rural American life or culture, he chooses instead for shameless praise of Britain or Europe .  Sprinkled throughout, for apparent entertainment, are juvenile attempts at humor - usually references to bodily functions or stupid sexual jokes.<br />  The British - during the War - used to refer to Americans as 'Overfed, Oversexed, and Over here'.  Might they be referring to Bryson?

B001NFNFIK|2.0|I thought this film was, sadly, disappointing. I say this as a fan of James Lee Burke--and there's the rub: If you haven't read the Robicheaux books, you will be mystified by this film. The characters from the books are not introduced to the viewer; they simply appear--and you have no idea who they are or why they're significant to Robicheaux.    I also got very tired of Hollywood actors doing fake Louisiana accents (Tommy Lee Jones gets a pass). The requisite blues soundtrack is good. The cinematography captures the flavor of Cajun territory. But somehow it all ends up seeming contrived--like Hollywood's version of Louisiana.    Burke's books are complex, involving many, many characters and subplots, and the film tries to include everything. The end result is confusion. From one scene to the next, you're wondering exactly what is going on.     All films are obviously artificial, but good films make you forget the artifice, even those made from books (_No Country for Old Men_ comes to mind). In this film, the artifice is in your face.    Forget the movie and read the book.
B00454U1NS|4.0|I am a huge Pink fan and have all of her cds- but I'll be honest I took a different route for this cd, I bought her 2 new songs from the Amazon music store because I already owned the rest.  I am, however, very pleased with the song listing and thing she chose a fantastic mix of her songs!
B003XQRZ7E|5.0|If you like the work of Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple and Trapeze, you must have this album, with 11 amazing tracks from beginning to end, featuring the talents of five great musicians, who united the experiences of their careers in an album worthy of the best classic rock. Highlighting the impressive performances of Hughes and the amazing work of Bonamassa on guitar. The support of Bonham and Sherinian complement the team, placing Black Country Communion among the great world of classic rock.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I was not sure what to think about this album. It is a huge departure from the variety of classical and international sound of his previous albums. I was excited when he announced that he was realeasing a fourth album. The singles he released earlier, \\"Você Existe Em Mim\\", \\"Hidden Away\\", \\"L'Ora Dell'Addio\\", and \\"Higher Window\\" were all equally gorgeous, well-crafted and were among his best songs yet, especially \\"Você Existe Em Mim\\" in particular. I had a feeling that the rest of the album was going to be just as superb, unqiue, and full of variety. Imagine my suprise when I listened to all the songs and found it entirely unexpected and different.      Overall it it a first rate album with a very strong and almost formal sound. It definitely the most contemporary of his albums as well as his more personal as he wrote or co-produced most of the songs. I just don't like that almost all the songs sound the same and somewhat monotonous. The reason I loved his previous work was the variety of styles which ranged from classical to experiemental. My favorite aspect of his music is the way he brings out the beauty of the Italian language (\\"Canto Alla Vita\\", \\"Oceano\\",\\"Per Te\\", \\"Un Girono Per Noi\\", \\"Caruso\\", \\"Mi Mancherai\\" etc.), all of which are my favorite songs by Josh and the what first drew me to his music. I could always count on Josh to include and showcase international styles of music, such as  African and jazz with Ladysmith Black Mambazo, Vusi Mahlasela, and Herbie Hancock in Awake and his collaboration with experimental French band Deep Forest in \\"Never Let Go\\" on Closer.     I felt that this album was terrbily lacking that exploration and crossover of genres that he had become known for as this album seems has more a solely contemporary and more unified sound that is humdrum and dragging along at the same time.     It goes without saying that my favorite track obviously from this album was the Portugese \\"Você Existe Em Mim\\" which seems to be the only international song along with drums, a unqiue feature I have always looked forward to in Josh's work ever since I listened to \\"Canto Alla Vita\\" and his cover of Linkin Park's \\"My December\\".     My second favorite was \\"L'Ora Dell'Addio\\" which is majestic and soaring, but remains the sole staple of any Italian music on this album.     Everything else consisted of some fresh and new contemporary elements ranging from formal on the orchestral song \\"London Hymn\\", a lot of love songs (every other song), a self composed song in French called \\"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi\\", and covers of English/Irish artists such as Declan O'Rourke's \\"Galileo\\" and Nick Cave's \\"Straight to You.\\"     It is still a good album even though it is definitely different and far from what I have come to expect from Josh. I'm still glad that Josh is pursuing a more personal and different direction for his music. I just hope that he will not forget the previous elements of his previous music that first drew his fans to his music.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I received this CD to review from One2One network.  I've always liked Norah Jones, and this album did not disappoint!  It is a collection of her singing with various artists, and the genres very quite a bit, however I honestly liked all of them.  I think this would be great to play at parties because of the variety.  My favorite was definitely the duet with Willie Nelson singing Baby It's Cold Outside
0525951652|5.0|I thoroughly enjoyed this book and look forward to the follow on books.  Does anyone know when the next book will be released?  My biggest issue as a Kindle user is the cost of the books. Other than physically carrying the books I feel Kindle users are getting the royal hose on the pricing.  I guess its time to go to Costco and buy the books at a discount.  Sorry for getting off of topic.
0545123275|3.0|Let me preface this by saying that I will more than likely after giving this review order a copy of the next one, Linger. I will read it in the time before bed, like I did the first, and will like some things about it and not like others.  I must admit that I am a tough sell when it comes to books. If I dont like a book, I will not finish it, and that can include the first two chapters! Which is why I mostly prefer going to the bookstore so that I can read through the first chapter if I want to.    Why I picked it up - I liked the cover art, superficial thing that I am. I am also tired of the whole vampire genre, for now, and am a dog/wolf-lover. I did like the characters, and wanted to know more about them - even the peripheral characters were interesting. The descriptions were very poetic in a pretty-not-gritty way. You see what she saw, feel what she is feeling. Even down to the food preparation.    Why I didnt like it.  Reason #1. I think some of the dialog was sketchy - use of some of the slang was bad.   Reason #2. Not a lot of real action that was exciting. A few instances, here and there...  Reason #3. I wanted more of an explanation about why there was not much research done previous to Grace coming along, as to how to stop the \\"change\\" to wolf. So the \\"cure\\" aspect of it didnt appeal to me all that much.   Reason #4. I never was 100% clear whose perspective I was reading at any one time and had to keep checking the chapter. The character \\"voices\\" werent distinguished well enough between Sam and Grace. And it was mentally jarring for me at times. I am not a fan of changing perspectives between characters in this book.    Lastly,  Reason #5. I dont think I really liked the explanation that simple application of heat could stop the change. That didnt make any sense whatsoever to me.     All in all, though, I liked the book enough to entertain the possibility of reading the next one...

B003YWUTJI|4.0|I was lucky enough to receive an advance copy of this album.  In every song Norah is singing with or \\"over\\" another artist.  The songs range from Foo Fighters to Ray Charles across all genres of music and yet all manage to be brought together under Norah's ultimately mellow style.  No one song caught my attention more than the others enough to have me singing along...  which leads me to think that this would be ideal as background music at a party or even to listen to before going to sleep or while in the bathtub to relax.
B001BPQT8A|5.0|It is amazing how the experience changes with the resmasterization, and of course a Blu Ray player connected throught HDMI and a LED Screen!
B0044XV3QY|5.0|First off I'll address the people complaining about the absence of a 3-D version. Panasonic currently has an exclusive right to the 3-D version of 'Avatar' till February 2012. Cameron has stated that the standalone 3-D release is still one to two years out. The market simply isn't saturated enough with 3DTV's to justify at this time, and from a business standpoint this is actually smart. Early adopters of 3D technology shouldn't be surprised here, its nothing new to the electronics industry. In time it will happen, that goes for other films as well.<br /><br />The film is once again presented in its natively shot 1.78:1 ratio. Cameron has admitted to falling in love with the 16:9 version, and stated that he does not ever plan to release the 2.35:1 crop of it for home-release. Why anyone want to chop off the original frame on the top and bottom, then blow it up, is beyond me. I see a lot a comments about this and wanted to help clear that up as well.<br /><br />This movie has been cited as revolutionary to cinema for its technical breakthroughs. Some criticism has been placed on its story seeming too familiar but I think that is kinda what made it work. The new technology had a good old-fashioned story-arc to carry it, while at the same time giving us an entirely new universe and setting, and being one that could be accepted cross-culturally. This film broke box-office records in just about every country in the world, it was a gamble that paid off. Its now the top-selling Blu-ray of all time as well, so obviously the 3-D was a bonus, yet not so much a requirement to enjoy it. Its a great science-fiction film with traditional elements to drive it, exploration, a love-story, and Cameron's trademark action sequence directing. The third-act really shines in the aspect of the latter. That is my opinion for what its worth, nothing more, nothing less.<br /><br />This release gives you the film as originally cut and by utilizing seamless-branching, you can watch two more extended versions of it. After watching it now, I feel the extended version gives the viewer much more background on Jake's story-arc, the conflict between the Na'vi and the humans, and the character of Grace as well. I was very impressed with it. The Blu-ray video and audio transfer still shines as reference quality. Basically this is the movie where you can really push the potential of your home-theater. Clean, no artifacts, and very sharp. The added scenes also look clean, and just as crisp as the original scenes. WETA really did a great job on them considering they were just for a limited special-edition theatrical release.<br /><br />Audio is prefect. Excellent DTS-HD master audio and it could pass for the original studio-master. Clean, clear, and powerful when it needs to be. I never touched my system while leaving it at my usual volume and found it very comfortable throughout.<br /><br />I do not even know where to begin to talk about all of the special-features presented on this disc set. There is a mountain of them to go through, though as of this writing I still haven't been through them all, but I would have to say that a person who watches all of them could walk away knowing almost as much as Cameron does about the making of this film. Every aspect of the film's production is covered. You also get on the fly comparisons of the various stages of motion-capture, pre-render, and final-render..all at the push of a button real-time. This is great for someone who likes to see instantly how the scene evolved into the final product that we saw on the screen. Almost an hour of deleted scenes are there too, each one of them are unique and can provide insight on various scenes throughout the film. There were actually a few scenes which I pondered being cut to begin with, but I know they were trying to keep the pacing right. Documentaries, the original script and scriptment, the theatrical trailers, an extensive production artwork montage, exclusive BD-Live features, etc. The list just keeps going...fans of the film will love it all I'm sure. Disc 3 of the Blu-ray version has almost all of the CGI parts of the movie with the motion-capture footage picture in picture for viewing as a comparison. I really loved this, it even had the love-scene on it.<br /><br />Fox and Cameron both stated to the press before the first home release that this collector's version was coming in November. Your option to double-dip was on the table then and there. This release is the definitive version for fans of the film. I would even recommend it to non-fans because of the extended scenes and how they, in my opinion, improve upon the story in a subtle way.<br /><br />Overall, this film and this release, receives no less than 5-stars from me. Like any other blockbuster, it has had its share of praise and cultural-backlash, but I feel its an epic popcorn flick worthy of anyone's collection.the film will love it all I'm sure.

B002F6FQGK|5.0|Florence + the Machine are simply phenomenal. Please, if you haven't yet, listen to the samples that Amazon so kindly provides. Now, keep in mind that I did this very same thing myself, but still wasn't entirely convinced on this album. But with so many glowing reviews, how could so many people be off base? So I bought it on some partial listening and the faith of the masses. And I was not let down at all.    These songs are unique enough to stand out in today's crowded music scene. They are well crafted, blending powerful drum beats, melodious keyboards, and soothing harp chords (harps being in my opinion one of the most underutilized instruments out there today). And over it all, Florence has a set of lungs that can knock your socks off, which leaves no question in your mind as to where the name of the album came from. But above all else these songs can best be described as majestic, which is in part why the little snippets don't do it any justice. These songs are suited to big sound and an enveloping atmosphere.     Florence + the Machine is now the band to watch for me, and will certainly occupy a favorites spot for me on any playlist.
0316069884|3.0|Foer is doing the work of written activism, plain and clear, advocating, mostly, from a utilitarian perspective, a case for vegetarianism. It really is surprising that he doesn't mention Peter Singer since I would conceive of Foer's argument as utilitarian because he's concerned with the pain and suffering of animals forced, and born, into factory farms and his real struggle seems to be with not being able to say directly that eating animals is \\"wrong\\" while at the same time having complicated reactions to their death, even if they are not factory farmed. Re-direct me if I'm incorrect here, but Foer's book straddles the line between a utilitarian argument (Singer's, essentially) and a less-developed argument about the significance of remembering and forgetting:    - \\"To remember animals and my concern for their well-being, I may need to lose certain tastes and find other handles for the memories that they once helped me carry\\" (194)    - \\"...I simply cannot feel whole when so knowingly, so deliberately, forgetting\\" (198)    - Also, of note: \\"The meat industry has tried to paint people who take this two-fold stance as absolutist vegetarians hiding a radicalized agenda. But ranchers can be vegetarians, vegans can build slaughterhouses, and I can be a vegetarian who supports the best of animal agriculture\\"  (242)    Foer may be using pathos to elicit reader participation, but his argument, even if he does not acknowledge it overtly by mentioning Singer or other utilitarian philosophers, is utilitarian. It is based on increasing pleasure and reducing pain.    Foer goes through the motions: The factory farm model is exceptionally painful and violent; the small animal farm is exceptionally rare and an improvement in animal welfare but still brands and castrates its bulls and cows and is still involved in a constant, forced reproduction cycle of the (female) cows (in order to produce milk, which is meant for the calf), and who knows what happens to the calves (they may either be sold and tethered for veal, or kept on the farm to grow up into bulls or adolescents that too will eventually be slaughtered); and then there is always the slaughter, the end of living either in pain or pleasure or both.    It is obvious to a humane reader that the struggles Foer is grappling with are ones that are complicated, multi-faceted, layered, and I would argue inseparable from other systemic forms of violence and oppression, though Foer does not go there, which is a shame. He certainly makes use of facts, but he limits his interpretation of those facts.    So, for instance, I borrow from animal rights literature and feminist philosophy when I say that the quintessentially exploited farmed animal is female. We saw, as depicted in the book, the egregious treatment of (female) sows and (female) egg-laying hens. (We don't have the depiction of (female) \\"milk-producing\\" cows, which is also egregious.) In all of these instances, female reproductive systems are exploited to unfathomable reaches. Thus, the female animal bears the brunt (and, to be clever, the runt) of the systemic exploitation of animals. Without the female animal body, there would cease to be any more animal bodies, female or male, and yet, it is only through the forced seizure of the female animal body that exploitation becomes possible, and where it begins.    A well-known writer (I apologize that I forget his name now), when asked why he was vegetarian, said, \\"I do not eat anything with a mother.\\" This may sound cheesy or lovey-dovey at first read, but upon closer analysis it becomes obvious that it is the mother, or the female, that is first and foremost exploited. First, with the forced insemination, second with the painful process of reproduction or the giving birth coupled with the seizure of the newborn at a painfully tender age, and, finally, after years of such \\"labor,\\" the transport and slaughter of the female animal.    My criticism of the book is that it mostly recapitulates information about the violence of contemporary animal agriculture in the United States. Yet the book is doing important work by bringing the limelight on the \\"locked doors\\" of factory farms and I see this as an important project of the book.    Even more important than criticism though for an author and an invested reader dealing with a tremendous moral issue of our time is the fear of inaction. The fear that we will simply sigh and say, \\"People are done consuming this book. The process is over in a matter of minutes.\\"
B000002GYI|4.0|Computer World is an album that focuses on simplicity and repetitive beats.  Normally this is enough to discourage me away from it like a virus, however...    This album is actually pretty good.    Every single track is melodic enough to keep me interested, and let's not forget the overall influential electronic *sound* of the album that's considered fairly groundbreaking by early 80's standards.  When the 70's pretty much featured MOST of the originators- here comes Kraftwerk's Computer World indicating once again that the well hasn't run dry just yet.    Even though I'm hearing the album for the first time right now, this kind of music DOES take me back to the early 80's because it has that familiar dance vibe reminiscent of popular bands like Duran Duran and the Talking Heads.  In fact this album was released six weeks before I was born so the vibes are quite strong for me personally.    Plus it's interesting to hear a bands interpretation of what the computer world was like (or *could* have been) back in the early 80's.  No ladies and gentlemen- the world of computers wasn't exactly focused around the internet and fast speed connections back then, haha.      Anyway, Kraftwerk never really won me over when listening to their fairly aimless early 70's albums, but this one... is good.
B0043GAZYS|2.0|I was so excited to watch this movie I couldn't bear it. I sat down with my wife, sister, and future brother-in-law. When I heard the familiar video game music in the beginning I got so excited and couldn't wait for more. Then I realized that this movie is WAY different than the previews. I don't want to spoil it for others but this was definitely not for me and I feel I'm pretty open to different types of movies.

0374290024|5.0|Ian Morris demonstrates with much conviction that neither the surmised superiority of Western thought (\\"long-term lock-in\\" theories) nor the temporary, largely accidental leadership of the West after 1800 CE (\\"short-term accident\\" theories) offers a satisfactory explanation of why the West currently rules (pp. 13-14; 17-18; 73; 166-167; 226; 260; 474; 521; 564; 572; 575; 619-620).  As Mr. Morris points out correctly, the partisans of these theories largely ignore thousands of years during which the West did not move along a straight line to its eventual dominance of the world (pp. 169-170).  Famine, disease, migration, state collapse, and climate change played at times a key role in shaping social development, which measures a community's ability to get things done (pp. 144; 560; 598).<br /><br />Mr. Morris explores two key themes in the book under review:<br />1) Although biology and sociology explain the global similarities, geography explains the regional differences;<br />2) While geography decides where development rises or falls fastest, social development also determines what geography means (pp. 30; 592).<br /><br />To make his case, Mr. Morris invites his readers to embark on an epic journey to explore what happened between 14000 BCE and today mainly in Eurasia (pp. 130; 166; 558; 640-641).  The globe's most developed societies have always been ones that found their genesis in either the original Western or the original Eastern core (p. 32).<br /><br />Mr. Morris finds out that the West has ruled the world for the last sixteen millennia with the exception of a major parenthesis between about 550 and 1775 CE when the Eastern regions of Eurasia took over from their Western counterparts (pp. 25; 129-133; 223; 332; 337; 395-396; 422; 429; 476; 564).  The examination of this time range allows Mr. Morris to clearly demonstrate that \\"short-term accident\\" theories of why the West rules for now do not make sense at all. Geography has been the key to driving social development in the favor of the West for most of the last sixteen millennia.  However, geography does not exist in a vacuum.  Social development also defines what geography represents (pp. 30-31; 41; 82; 117-118; 144; 271; 427; 557; 561; 565; 572; 592; 619-620; 643).  Mr. Morris observes that the higher social development rises, the faster it can continue rising.  Each innovation builds on earlier ones and contributes to later ones (pp. 194-195).  To come to these conclusions, Mr. Morris develops an original human development index to measure the evolution of social development during this period.  Urbanism, energy capture, information processing, and capacity to make war are the key metrics that Mr. Morris uses to measure the ups and downs of social development over time (pp. 143-171; 623-640).  The most that any great men and \\"bungling idiots\\" could do until 1945 CE was to speed up or slow down processes that were already under way (pp. 316; 416-417; 429; 449; 479; 565-568; 616).<br /><br />Mr. Morris convincingly shows that the great transformations of social development, i.e., the origins of agriculture, the rise of cities and states, the creation of different kinds of empires, and the industrial revolution were each the result of desperate times calling for desperate measures (pp. 559-560).  Human core societies have repeatedly seen their further social development blocked, what Mr. Morris calls their hard ceilings (pp. 34; 560; 563-565; 598; 607).  Rising social development results into bigger populations, more elaborate lifestyles, and greater wealth and military power (pp. 225; 561).  These changes unleash forces, i.e., famine, disease, migration, and state collapse, which undermine social development, especially if they occur at the time of climate change (p. 560).  At the same time, bigger, more complex societies tend to have more sophisticated ways to respond to the bigger, more threatening disruptions that they generate (pp. 225; 404; 418-420; 533; 598).Mr. Morris calls this seemingly contradictory phenomenon the paradox of development (pp. 28; 34; 225; 329-330; 504; 530; 560-562; 601).  This paradox is the main reason why \\"long-term lock-in\\" theories are unsatisfactory in explaining why the West rules for now (p. 195).<br /><br />Mr. Morris forecasts that the East will catch up again with the West by exploiting the advantages of backwardness.  The East is expected to bypass the West by the beginning of the twenty-second century if their respective human development indexes continue to increase at their current speed (pp. 582-583; 619).  Furthermore, Mr. Morris predicts that in the twenty-first century, social development will go up so high that geography will become meaningless (p. 619).<br /><br />However, Mr. Morris has reservations about his own predictions.  The paradox of development mentioned above could wreak these predictions due to the currently perceived limits in the expected growth rates of urbanism, energy capture, information processing, and capacity to make war (pp. 590-598; 608-613).  In addition, Mr. Morris reminds his audience that geography will remain unfair in the twenty-first century, which will eventually allow the West to keep its lead over the rest of the world (pp. 601-602).  Finally, Mr. Morris reminds his audience that with the continuous rise in (nuclear) military capacity, great men and \\"bungling idiots\\" with access to these weapons have had the ability to change history since 1945 CE.<br /><br />In summary, Mr. Morris hopes that humanity will learn not only from archeology and the media, but also from history to save itself from its unmatched capacity for auto-destruction (pp. 621-622).y contradictory phenomenon the paradox of development (pp. 28; 34; 225; 329-330; 504; 530; 560-562; 601).

B0043URV8M|4.0|Most movie franchises fall flat well before their seventh outing. The Harry Potter series has not, probably for two main reasons: there's always been some sense (even before all the books were released) of where the franchise was headed, and there's been continued participation of key cast and crew members (including the main trio of the series, most of the adult cast, producer David Heyman, and writer Steve Kloves). So it's easy to see why the scores for the Harry Potter movies have quavered in quality much more than the movies for which they were written: they have no sense of direction and there have now been four composers for the last five films.    Desplat is no different than Doyle and Hooper in the way he treats Williams's original themes for the first few movies. Like those two before him, Desplat takes the the first few bars of Williams's \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", inserts it into a few tracks, and  ignores the rest of Williams's material. At this point, it shouldn't be expected to hear a reprisal of Williams themes like Diagon Alley, Quidditch, or Window to the Past. Those themes were written topically and it's doubtful even Williams himself would have found it important to use them (he abandoned most of his own themes in his score for Prisoner of Azkaban, after all). The least Desplat could have done, however, was made a full reference to Hedwig's Theme, as it really is the iconic musical track of the series. Particularly noticeable is the theme's absence from the album's opening tracks--it's first fragmented appearance is in the third track of the album, \\"Polyjuice Potion\\" . Hopefully, the theme will be played at the beginning of the score in the movie itself, as it has been with each of the last six movies.    But there are more important things. Taking up a scoring assignment so late in the series makes the lack of direction in the series more conspicuous for Desplat than it was for either Doyle or Hooper. Ultimately, though, Desplat didn't do Williams any less justice than his two predecessors, and the music he did write is pretty impressive.     The main theme of the 2009 fantasy movie he scored, \\"The Twilight Saga: New Moon\\" was the titular track \\"New Moon.\\" The opening track of this Deathly Hallows score, \\"The Oblivation\\", blows \\"New Moon\\" away in its soaring melodic phrases and more interesting orchestral development. The two tracks are actually constructed very similarly, a fairly simple theme being played over a low string ostinato and gradually developed. The Oblivation is not the main theme of the soundtrack (although it introduces one of the major new themes), but seems to me rather more like an overture to the score.    Arguably the major new theme of the soundtrack is introduced at the beginning of \\"Polyjuice Potion\\". Based on a three-note octave figure, it's played first by violins and horn and is quickly taken over in a minor form by trumpet and then English horn. It sounds almost pastoral, and easily could represent Harry's feelings towards the Burrow (which is the Weasley's place of residence, for all of you non-Potterheads). Instead, Desplast seems to contort the theme throughout the film to match changing moods, for example at 2:56 in \\"Sky Battle\\". Most characteristically, he arranges a tragic version of the theme for piano in \\"Harry and Ginny\\", appropriately conveying Harry and Ginny's longing to be together but the necessity that they stay apart. This approach works, but I almost wish Depslat had taken inspiration from the \\"Romeo and Juliet\\" track from the New Moon soundtrack. A proper theme for their conflicted relationship would have been most effective.     Finally, something I really like--a theme for the Death Eaters. The series has needed one ever since Goblet of Fire when they were first introduced, but Doyle and Hooper both failed to write one. First introduced in \\"Snape to Malfoy Manor\\" and then reprised in \\"Death Eaters\\", the theme adequately portrays the Death Eaters and should play well inthe film.    A third theme is a very simple one first introduced in \\"The Oblivation\\" and then played at the outset of \\"Death Eaters\\", by solo cello in \\"Ron Leaves\\", and again by high violins in \\"Ron's Speech\\". Due to this random assortment I can't tell what the theme is supposed to represent exactly, but it's perhaps the best-developed identifiable theme on the album.    After having nothing but Hooper Harry Potter scores for the last 5 years, listening to this soundtrack is like taking a first breath after minutes of holding it in. Finally, a full brass section is heard in all its glory. There's satisfyingly complex action music, interesting modulations, and a rich palette of orchestral colors.  This album earns a better rating than either of Hooper's with its opening track alone.     Let's instead compare this soundtrack to those of Williams and Doyle. The music Williams established for the franchise is highly effective and, even six soundtracks later, could still inspire new music for the franchise. Desplat's approach to the score is somewhat similar to Williams. There are no concert suites to be found on the album but the way he develops cues for individual scenes is very like Williams. \\"Sky Battle\\" recalls \\"Quidditch, Third Year\\" and \\"Destroying the Locket\\" recalls \\"Dementors Converge\\". He handles the cues for Dobby and Xenophilius Lovegood like how you would expect Williams to (although the actual theme Williams wrote for Dobby is not heard here).     You can just tell the score will be effective in the film from listening to the soundtrack. It's too competently made for it not to. But, although the music is effective, and Desplat certainly earned his paycheck, it could seldom be described as magical. If you listen to Williams's scores, he infuses magical wonder into nearly every cue, from the iconic \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" to the breathtaking \\"Buckbeak's Flight\\" to the darkest moments of his scores, like in \\"The Face of Voldemort.\\" All of his cues simply sound likeHarry Potter. A lot of the music on this DH1 soundtrack sounds like it could have been interchanged with cues from \\"The Last Airbender\\".     As for Doyle--like Desplat, he ignored Williams's music except for a few uses of Hedwig's Theme, but the music he wrote to replace Williams's had a strong sense of identity and moreover had an incredible sense of storytelling. You can see the movie play in your head when you listen to the track \\"The Goblet of Fire\\" or \\"Harry Sees Dragons.\\" Desplat's soundtrack in contrast starts to lag during the middle and many minutes of music accumulate that contribute nothing to the score overall.     There are standout moments that rank with the best of Harry Potter music, including the two Ron tracks, \\"Hermione's Parents\\", \\"The Elder Wand\\", and, my personal favorite, \\"Fireplaces Escape.\\" But then there are tracks like \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\" and \\"Bathilda Bagshot\\" that are mostly written according to strict conventions. Since Williams and Doyle both wrote homerun soundtracks, it's only fair to expect the absolute best from Desplat. Instead, he's given us good, and occasionally very good.     John Williams started off the franchise as a composer with already 42 years of experience and 5 Oscars. Desplat is only 49 years of age himself. It is no longer the expectation that Williams's themes be developed for the late movies in the franchise; if Doyle didn't and Hooper didn't, it's certainly not Desplat's duty to. But, frankly, even when Williams abandoned most of his own themes for his score in Prisoner of Azkaban, his vast experience allowed him to write beautiful music for the film that worked perfectly as a score and on soundtrack. Maybe Alexandre Desplat will be able to write music like that when he's 70. For now, though, it's possible that no Harry Potter score can truly live up to Williams's first three, simply because they were not written by Williams. The piano music in \\"Harry and Ginny\\" is a first for the franchise. Desplat really stuck to his style for this score, and the resulting music is probably the best fantasy score he's done (surpassing \\"The Golden Compass\\" and \\"New Moon\\"). While he isn't Williams, this music was written with conviction, and it shows.    I'd probably rank this soundtrack above the two Hooper scores, below Sorcerer's Stone, Prisoner of Azkaban, and Goblet of Fire, and perhaps tied with Chamber of Secrets. Desplast was recently announced to be the composer for Deathly Hallows: part 2, and it'll be interesting to see where he takes the music for the finale. That project will demand grand action music, dark prose, touching character moments, and something poignant to wrap everything up. I'm just glad he's the one composing and I'm the one reviewing.    I'll be updating this review with my thoughts on how the score plays in the movie, as well as the 6 bonus tracks that were not included in the album.
B0043M4HFA|1.0|The price of this stripped down Kindle edition is more than twice as expensive as a printed copy. What an epic fail and an utter ripoff.
B000T02OJQ|4.0|Their early work was a little too new wave for my tastes, but when Sports came out in '83, I think they really came into their own, commercially and artistically. The whole album has a clear, crisp sound, and a new sheen of consummate professionalism that really gives the songs a big boost. He's been compared to Elvis Costello, but I think Huey has a far much more bitter, cynical sense of humor.  In '87, Huey released this, Fore, their most accomplished album. I think their undisputed masterpiece is \\"Hip to be Square\\", a song so catchy, most people probably don't listen to the lyrics. But they should, because it's not just about the pleasures of conformity, and the importance of trends, it's also a personal statement about the band itself.
B0009ML238|4.0|While Circus Maximus isn't exactly genre-busting or pushing progressive metal to new places, what they do, they do very well and sometimes that's more than enough. This album, like their other album Isolate, is not one that blew me away the first spin or two, but over time I've really come to appreciate the musicianship, quality of song writing/lyrics and even though they don't really take the genre anywhere new, it's a great album.<br /><br />I would say that this album isn't quite on par with Isolate, but has a few real gems on the album like \\"Why am I here\\", \\"1st chapter\\", and \\"Glory of the Empire\\". While it's true they aren't pushing boundaries like Suspyre on \\"When Time Fades\\" or Frost on \\"Experiments\\", they have no weaknesses either.<br /><br />Basically any fan of Dream Theater, Kamelot, Redepemtion or similar bands will find a lot to like here and this disc should end up earning a spot in your rotation after a few spins.

B002N5N5M0|4.0|So, let me begin by stating that if I'm rating this show in relation to most of the nonsense and \\"reality\\" shows on TV right now this show would get the full 5 stars, not the 4 I rated it. That being said, the Season begins with a pretty graphic and slightly disturbing scene with Lithgow's character killing his victim in the tub and making her watch herself die.....and this ends up being foreshadowing for what is to come in a very creepy and fascinating study of human nature.<br /><br />Lithgow is very strong in this season and creates a pretty complex, nuanced character that really showcases some of his abilities. I'm sure as an actor he was pretty grateful to be afforded the opportunity to work with such strong material. Bringing Carradine's character back for the Trinity killer arc was nice and set up some pretty interesting TV, though one begins to wonder if Debra is going to make it through a season without finding 2-3 people to sleep with. Not that I'm opposed to women who like to spread the love, or anything like that, just that season after season it gets a little one note. Also very interesting was Dexter's fascination with Arthur and even more so when the truth about Arthur and his family starts to emerge. All in all, the main arc was very satisfying.<br /><br />The rest of arc involving Rita in the kids was hit and miss for me. I loved the relationship and the complexities that came with Dexter having to face what it takes to be in a relationship and watching Dexter grow just a little bit and learn to embrace a bit more of his humanity was interesting. It also sets up the surprise ending that really hits both Dexter and the audience right between the eyes so all in all, very well planned.<br /><br />The Angel/Bautista romance I could have done without. The police detective suspecting Dexter thing has already been there done that with Doakes....why repeat it exactly with Quinn? The astor storyline was a bit tedious. However, even with those less than interesting arcs, I found the season as a whole to be very strong and would recommend it anyone, after they watched the first 3 seasons of course. ;)the season as a whole to be very strong and would recommend it anyone, after they watched the first 3 seasons of course. ;)
B0042EJD8A|5.0|In 2001 Dick Cheney and the most powerful figures in the gas and oil industries hid behind closed doors to devise an energy policy that made hazards to health and the environment legal.  Today filmmaker Josh Fox, out in the open with just a video recorder, responds with the documentary GASLAND, a trek across 24 United States where natural gas drilling makes tap water flammable - and makes an inordinately high percentage of locals sick.<br /><br />I had never thought twice about natural gas - it's been an energy source since before I was born.  As GASLAND explains, what's upped the ante is the secret Cheney meeting's approval of the secretive process of hydraulic fracturing - nicknamed fracking - a mix of dangerous chemicals and large amounts of public drinking water to extract gas from the ground that devastates the environment.<br /><br />Will GASLAND prove the stone with which David-like Josh Fox fells the Goliath that is Big Energy?  As I write this in November 2010, Pennsylvania has just elected natural gas industry-friendly Tom \\"Pennsylvania is open for business\\" Corbett.

0345479092|5.0|We received this book from a friend and read it with no preconceived ideas.  Overall this book was very helpful for us as first time parents.<br /><br />The Good:<br />It talks about making a routine for your baby EASY is what she calls it.  E-eat, S-sleep, A-awake time, Y-you time.  We adopted the EASY routine and it has worked great.  Our son is 8 months old and is healthy and happy.  With this routine their is less crying (from the baby because they get fed before they get cranky and from the mom because she actually gets some time to herself:>) She also talks about figuring out why your baby is crying before you just shove a bottle or breast in their mouth.  She also takes about the different schools of thought on crying it out verse not.<br /><br />The Bad:<br />I found some of the things she said about your babies understanding you from birth a little weird.  She also doesn't believe in nipple confusion and has some other off views about breastfeeding.<br /><br />Overall:<br />I think it was a great book, it really helped us as first time parents.  Getting our son on a schedule was a great thing and it helped him start to sleep through the night at 5 weeks!  However it is like anything else, take it all with a grain of salt and remember you are the parents, so you do what you think it best no matter what the books say!!
0375842209|5.0|While I try to read at least one book a week, this is the best book I ever read.  (I read this about four years ago, just getting around to doing a review)I saw Charlie Gibson interview Marcus and he was so thankful and gracious when the screen went blank and the sound was still on, I thought, hmmm.  This guy seems like a nice person, Charlie said it will be a classic, so I thought, I will get it!  Well the first 30 pages were so different I thought, Charlie never read this what a bunch of bunk, but by page 31 I could not put it down.  It was amazing, while I have read a lot of history it gave me a perspective I had not thought about before.  I found the unique perspective of the story, (from \\"DEATH\\"); an amazing way for someone to write a book.  During WWII in Germany, Death was busy so what an outstanding idea.  I have purchased several of these books and handed them out, I have never talked to anyone who did not think it was one of the best books they ever read.  A co-worker who I gave a copy to called me up at 10:30PM one night crying telling me she had to read a part of the book to me another friend said this book is good to the last drop.  When I finished it, I can still remember sitting up in bed saying, \\"Oh my, Oh my, what a book, what a book, amazing.\\"
142311339X|5.0|Rick Riordan returns to the world of Camp Half-Blood with a new series, The Heroes of Olympus. Beginning with The Lost Hero, Riordan launches readers into an exciting new adventure with new and old friends out to explore unknown facets of a lush, mysterious world shrouded in myth, action and witty humor.    Jason wakes up on a bus holding hands with a girl named Piper and next to a boy named Leo. The bus is on the way to a The Grand Canyon, and Jason doesn't know why he's on it. Not only that, but he doesn't remember who he is, what he's doing there and who Piper, who claims to be his girlfriend, and Leo are. After being attacked by evil wind spirits, Jason, Piper and Leo are whisked away to Camp Half-Blood by Annabeth. When they arrive at Camp, they find that the demigods are in disarray. Their leader, Percy Jackson, is missing, and the gods have been silent for too long. It doesn't help when Hera, known for hating the demigods, calls upon Jason to go on a quest (a very Percy Jackson-like quest) to rescue her and discover why the gods have gone silent. Luckily, Jason brings Piper, who is revealed to be a daughter of Aphrodite, and Leo, a son of Hephastus to help -plus they have this really cool bronze dragon to help them get around. Of course, it doesn't help that Jason speaks fluent Latin, uses the Roman names for the gods and just happens to be the son of Zeus. As the adventure unravels, more secrets about the gods of Olympus are revealed.    I have absolutely nothing bad to say here: The Lost Hero is freaking awesome. I was riveted from the first page and couldn't put the book down until the end. Riordan's writing has matured here, and reaches new heights of epic adventure, humor and awesome. The world of Percy Jackson has never been so vibrant, the character never so much fun...and one of my personal favorites, the dialog. The witty, fun banter between characters that never got old. There's plenty of twists and turns to keep readers interested, and the balanceof new to old characters is firmly weighted toward the new characters, which pumps new life into the series.     Fans of Percy Jackson won't be disappointed. The Lost Hero is a must-read.
B00000JPH6|5.0|When this work first came out my children were young and I as their father, watched nearly everything with them.  This story catches your eye and you go with it and watch the effect on the children.  The overall effect is in their connection to the little characters of the adventure, Jim Henson and Frank Oz and all the creators of these many elements in the story have a very good line on the story.
B0031OCY2E|4.0|Ever in the mood for some decidedly offbeat entertainment?  Sure; we all are, from time to time.  How many shoot-'em-ups and car chases and rom-coms can we take to begin with?  For an eccentric changeup I recommend the quirky THE INFORMANT!, a (slightly) dark comedy about an \\"Aw shucks\\" nerd who helps bring down an international price-fixing cabal (on food derivatives, for cryin' out loud).  Based on a true story, this movie quietly entertains while giving the viewer a sound dose of corn pone (pun intended).<br /><br />THE INFORMANT! is carried delightfully on the pudgy shoulders of Matt Damon, playing ADM junior exec Mark Whitacre.  Good ol' Mark looks like someone you would rub elbows with at an ice cream social, and his sophomoric view of the corporate world is matched only by his cluelessness.  Cooperating with the FBI (he gets wired) he gathers evidence to put his coworkers away. . .then expects his employer to reward him for his efforts.  And Damon does all of this with a quirky, \\"gee willickers!\\" delivery that had me in stitches; as the movie grows even darker--with Whitacre growing ever more delusional--the jaw-dropping, disbelieving looks of his FBI cohorts (Scott Bakula and Joel McHale) are priceless.  Four stars instead of five, due to needless meandering; THE INFORMANT! indeed proves that quirky can be good for you.<br />--D. Mikels, Author, The Reckoning
B00402FGE4|5.0|Stargate Universe (SGU) is definitely a different twist on the common theme from the previous two Stargate television shows and the two Stargate movies. It is much \\"darker\\" and filled with more drama in the beginning, but once you get a little more than half way through with the first season, you'll find that the writers did a good job of taking their time to create great character interaction and development. The excitement really starts to build and I can say that the cliff hanger ending for Season 1 leaves you really wanting more and you're hooked and need to purchase Season 2. 5-stars!

1401323952|5.0|I always enjoy Nigella's cookbooks, even though I often do some necessary tweaking  with the  oven temperature and usually adding or subtracting   certain ingredients which I feel usually makes a huge difference , but  I do like Nigella books  a lot including this one.  We enjoyed the  Sweet and Sour Chicken, although I used fresh  bean sprouts and not canned and I used more fresh  vegetables including Bok Choy, but it was tasty. My husband and I enjoyed it, as we do with all of  Nigella's recipes from her  various books . Nigella tends to want to do things very fast, often using canned products, whereas I use  as much fresh stuff  as possible, and I'll usually try to cook things slower to let the flavors blend better, but  I do find that she's got very good recipes and she's  very inventive much of the time.  I really  like Nigella's cookbooks, and this latest one was very enjoyable, and worth having.
0307739961|5.0|This Larsson trilogy was nail biting to the very end.  I enjoyed every enticing moment.

1439177783|5.0|This was not what I was expecting. Yet, I couldn't put it down. The story is heart wrenching. The writing very accessible, keeps you turning the page. I read it in two nights. While it's an astounding inside look at an eating disorder, one can't help but think how many times across Hollywood every day is this story being acted out by actresses we admire. And this book will likley not change a thing there. But it may help young women elsewhere and I think also provides some clarity to people who may not have an eating disorder but do yo-yo dieting.<br /><br />As another reviewer mentioned this is not a recovery book. Something about de Rossi's ability to suddenly change on her own (okay, a relationship seemed to help her) seemed - I want to be careful not to criticize here - seemed a bit out of the ordinary given all she had been through. How many people are really capable of getting healthy on their own? I would think very few.<br /><br />I would be hesitant to give this book to someone with an eating disorder, it almost seems like a road map of how to successfully reach 82 lbs.<br /><br />Because this was so well written (and seemingly without the help of a ghost writer?) and because de Rossi is a creative person with imaginary tales in her head which she documents in the book, I hope she gives a shot at fiction writing. She might have found herself a new career and not one that will be based on what size dress she must fit into.

0812548094|4.0|This book is a behemoth at nearly 1,000 pages and Goodkinds deliver another fantastic adventure that picks following the events of the first book, Wizards first Rule. I really love the Mud People and having Richard and Kahlan spent so much time in the Mud village was a nice respite for the couple.    As they started to slowly process the stunning news of Richard's origins and become accustomed to their astonishing new powers, insurmountable problems ensue to send Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd on three diverging paths.     The middle portion of the book splits off into three separate quests: Richard's, Zedd's, and Kahlan's. Of the three storylines, Kahlan's is the most complex and adrenalin-fueled, her is actions are most pivotal in driving the action forward. When she took up the charge to lead that army of young Galeans, it was a heart-rendering and spectacular moment.    The Sisters of Light never connected, they were insincere and manipulative in their motvations and their involvement with Richard just fell flat for me.     I ended up loving the dragon Scarlet and the scarily adorable Gar, Gratch, more than I did the Sisters. Even the semi-reformed, danderous Mord-Sith were more likeable than the sorceresses.     Following Wizards First Rule I knew I had to brace for even more violence, torture, and rape scenes so I pretty much skimmed those passages. The author seems to have a propensity for depicting graphic sexual violence but lacks in creating intimacy, which deflated some of my reading enjoyment of this adventurous sequel. Also, I felt like the ending was too rushed to wrap up the story.      Now, this consistent comparison to Tolkien, Jordan, or George R.R. Martin is tiresome and nitpicking. Tolkien was the first and set the standard for this genre but no one author holds an exclusive patent for this genre nor does an author need permission to create their own fantasy world. Literary fantasy is open for the addition of new worlds to be built from various author's imaginations. Tolkien, Jordan, Martin had their vision and this is Goodkind's. SOT should stand on its own merit and the criticism should be based on whether or not a reader appreciated what the author has created, not that he dared touch some sacred cow.     Overall, Stone of Tears is a compelling sequel and good, if exhaustive read. I need to take a breather before tackling the third book, Blood of the Fold, but I am semi-hooked into the world of Richard, Kahlan, and Zedd.

Many reviewers have said much of what I've wanted to write about confinement, abuse, etc., so I won't be redundant. What the book did highlight through the eyes of Jack was a view of the real world and the highly-sensory, confusing messages that adults give each other and children. Many held beliefs from \\"Ma's\\" family were a bit disconcerting; the old adage that this is the way it is, etc. How would this boy even comprehend? That's what will stay with me. A definite must read.
B002ODEJYE|5.0|If you would have asked me to rate Pink about a year ago I would have said she's a decent singer, not a big deal. But in the last year I've heard a few more of her songs and I got to see this on Palladia and was blown away. So I had to get the BD. The sound on the BD is very clean and detailed. On some songs my surround system brings my room alive like I'm right there. I'm just very impressed by Pink and this concert.  Note also - watch the extended cuts after the concert. Theres a lot of cool stuff. Pink is one of those people who is talented and can do a lot of things but she also works her butt off too.

If you do not like Jamiroqui then you should start to.

Some reviewers hate on him and call him mediocre, but they couldn't be further from the truth. Look how many people collaborate with him- artists who have made their mark and have nothing left to prove are delighted to work with him. In my opinion, he hits a Home Run with this CD.

B004259BMM|2.0|As far as Keith Urban goes there is nothing wrong with the material on this disc. Pretty much what you would expect. Catchy tunes with great hooks and a couple smooth ballads. But only 8 songs?!! Come on Keith, you could not write a few more tracks or find a few song writers to round out the album to a respectable amount of tunes? If you want people to buy discs then you should make sure they are getting their moneys worth. I go with 2 stars not because of the music quality but the lack of effort and the obvious cash grab this project is.
0307001466|2.0|Crunch, crunch, crunch, editors had the book for lunch. I was so happy to find this book, I didn't scroll down and read the customer reviews. Wish I had, because I was very disappointed to find it abridged. Its not that long a book to begin with, so who would think pages would be left out? Only reason could be to keep the cost of the book down. I would have been happy to pay more to have the whole book.

B002BZZ63S|5.0|My friend first showed me a clip from this movie and told me it reminded him of us.  The two main characters, one was cautious and the other was very gung-ho or 'don't worry be happy'.  I did a little more research on it and found it was in German, but that didn't really affect my decision to purchase.  We watched it on a projector and the subtitles were about 5 feet across.  I was surprised at how easy it was for me to both follow the conversations and watch the movie.  I didn't want to spoil the movie so I didn't read too much into it.  By the end I was completely shocked and almost disturbed.  This was a great movie.  I would definitely recommend this movie even with the subtitles.  The scenery is great, and at very least you will get out of it is pumped for the coming climbing season.
0316098337|4.0|Donoghue's Room is certainly timely, if often uncomfortably eerie in its explorations of life in confinement and adjustment to the outside world salted with unexpected dangers. A young woman has been confined for seven years by her wily kidnapper in a securely locked 11' x 11' room. At only nineteen, it is impossible to comprehend the psychological impact of her imprisonment, perhaps the only saving grace the birth of her son, Jack, who is now five and the narrative voice of the novel. Donoghue, of course, is brilliant, whether writing historical fiction or contemporary novels, her perspective skewed to the idiosyncrasies that usually go unnoticed in human behavior. But in Room, everything is important, from Bed, where Ma and Jack sleep, to Rug, stained by Jack's entry into Room and his deliverance from it, even Tooth, a remnant of Ma's painful decay that Jack carries as a totem into the next phase of his life.<br /><br />The implications of such confinement are horrific, but Donoghue forces us into intimacy with circumstances beyond the shock value of the crime, the day to day challenges of a symbiotic relationship between mother and son, Jack unable to comprehend the separateness of Ma-and-Me. A tale of isolation becomes one of accommodation to \\"Outside\\" and the many obstacles awaiting a boy who has defined himself in relation to a tiny room, where inanimate objects are friends and the television images of people are fantasy. Accommodation to Outside is painful and shocking, a dog's bite, navigating stairs for the first time, orange juice with pulp (germs) and people who have no capacity for the infinite patience required to match child to a new reality. The author plumbs the dark places, Ma's unerring instinct to protect her son from \\"Old Nick\\", her own fragile mental state and the love of a mother for the child who saves her from despair.<br /><br />The healing of such a travesty is arduous work, the public easily distracted by the next breaking drama long before mother and child have begun to adjust to circumstances and the myriad times Jack is vulnerable to scrutiny. At times I felt as trapped as Ma, inside or outside Room, exhausted by Jack's litany of questions and his need for assurance. This is Donoghue's genius: to make her reader complicit in the demands and context of an emotional rollercoaster.

B000002MTU|5.0|From The Cradle sets an absolute standard for outstanding traditional blues! It is that good. If you want to buy one cd that conveys the power and extremely compelling attraction of traditional blues music, buy From The Cradle. Stevie Ray Vaughn is terrific, but he does not play and sing traditional blues like Eric Clapton does on From The Cradle. From The Cradle and Blues Breakers are the Eric Clapton recordings that I enjoy and appreciate the most. Eric Clapton's great reputation as an outstanding \\"bluesman\\" and guitar player are firmly and forever confirmed and anchored in From The Cradle and Blues Breakers. Anyone who does not give From The Cradle a five star rating does not appreciate outstanding BLUES music. Eric Clapton's guitar playing and his blues singing are both outstanding on From The Cradle. From The Cradle is a \\"MUST BUY\\" for every blues lover! Every song on this cd is outstanding blues.    John
0812548094|3.0|This is, unfortunately, a typical sophmore kind of effort from a new writer.  Wizard's First Rule was clearly a labor of love that went through countless edits before it finally found its way into book stores.  Thanks to its success, the sequel likely had very little editing, and was written in a much shorter period of time - and it shows.    I am guessing that the writing process went something like this: The author drafted a roughly 200 page outline of the story, then went back to the beginning and started adding detail.  A LOT of detail.  The first 75 pages of his outline swelled to about 500 pages.  Some of the detail needed adding, but there are also some 5-page-long speeches in there that could and should have been whittled down to a page at most.  My guess is that his editor gave him a free hand, and maybe was looking to do a lot of the editing once the book was complete.  This gives the first half of the book a plodding feel.  Goodkind's determination to make all his villains as wicked as possible doesn't help the mood, either.  Some of the extra detail in the book is used to detail graphically the gruesome aftermath of the sack of a city, and a dark ceremony with lovingly detailed bestiality - I see there's some concern on this site that that particular scene is not fit for teens.  My opinion is that it's not fit for adults either.  I wish there was a way to scrub that scene from my mind.      Suddenly, at about page 500, there is a shift in the level of detail, and the author spills all the secrets that he has lovingly saved up to surprise us with in one big gush.  You can almost feel the book deadline looming as his writing becomes sparse and frantic, with only occasional details, and little character development.  The last 75 pages of the book are probably taken verbatim from his original outline, with no further editing or additions.  The climax is ridiculously easy for our hero, who conveniently has the kind of magic that you don't actually need to learn how to use because it works instinctively.  So, with the world hanging in the balance 50 pages from the end, and several insurmaoutable problems, he basically waves his hand and the problems all go away.  It is a ridiculously simple and unsatisfying ending to a very dark and troubled book.  The worst is the way he is reconciled to Kahlan by a coincidental prayer to the \\"good spirits\\" at the end, which conveniently also solves Adie's problem as well.      The book, overall, is a disappointment, given the quality of Goodkind's first effort. It's clearly hampered by his newfound success, and subsequent deadline.  Goodkind needed to take the time to expand the whole of his outline, and then edit it back down to a reasonable level of detail - instead, we get a book that is too verbose at the start and too terse at the finish, with no happy medium in between.
0316077054|5.0|I'm so excited about this review I can hardly stand it. My fingers are nervous with excitement as I type. This book was everything I'd hoped for and much, much more. Kami and Margaret write with such passion and intensity that every time I cracked the book opened I felt like some kind of Caster spell was put on me, for I felt like I was in another world, in a trance. The very same way Beautiful Creatures would make me feel. It's really a great way to ignore the loud children and hungry husband. I can't express how good the writing is. It will take you places you could only imagine in your wildest dreams.<br /><br />Ethan... OH, Ethan. Since my husband does not read my reviews, I can say without hurting his feelings... ETHAN is tha' man. I have dreamt about him, for some reason my husband usually shows up and challenges Ethan to a dual, like in the days of Zorro. ( The mask really adds something ) I don't know where that came from???<br /><br />OK, back to serious. Ethan's love for Lena is so strong and intoxicating. I think that his love for her was the backbone to this entire Caster/Mortal love story. Everything centers around What wouldn't Ethan do for Lena? Ethan goes to the ends of the earth and back for a girl that when he holds her hand, he feels the numbing shock of the cold or when he kisses her he feels literally on fire. Ethan doesn't care about any of that. Risking his life is not even a question when it comes to the love he cherishes most. Believe me Risking his life is an understatement!!! He loves Lena so much it was almost a drug to me when I was reading about it. I know what your thinking... This stay-at-home-mom has completely lost it!!!<br /><br /> Beautiful Darkness took me on a journey that I was not expecting. The Castor tunnels, the forest and the caves were all so well described and painted on paper, I felt like I could read the maps that Liv ( You'll meet her soon enough ) would hold and smooth out on the palms of her hand. Link was such a great best friend, Always there for Ethan and of course was funnier than ever. And Amma, made me miss my grandmother. She was the perfect mix of stubborn, protective and Don't-Even-Roll-Your-Eyes-at-Me-or-I'ma-Gonna-Beat-You-With-a-Stick type of love. You don't know whether to cry because your scared Amma really has a stick or smile because deep down she knows what's best.<br /><br />Overall, I would have to say this book was pretty much perfection. I only have one tiny, negative, sad thing to say about this book and that would be, I wish Lena and Ethan were together more like in the BC. Since Lena doesn't want to cause Ethan any harm or put him in any type of danger she tries to keep a safe distance from him. Let me just say, Ethan Wate would have none of that nonsense...<br /><br />There are so many other things I want to say about this book and about the characters that I loved so much, but spoilers would be involved and I can't do that!lways there for Ethan and of course was funnier than ever.

B002ZG98FU|5.0|This was a great movie, just watched it a couple of hours ago and not only my husband and I thought it was great...everyone else did too!  Good acting from everyone and the movie moved right along.  It's great to go watch a movie and just be throroughly entertained and to leave the theatre with a smile on your face.  This is good enough that we're adding it to our movie library as soon as it becomes available and we don't buy a lot of movies.

B002ZG99CM|4.0|If you expect to see a word by word redo of the old classic, you won't like it. But then, if you want to see the original, you can just go see that. On its very own, the movie is alright. The love story side is hard to believe because the kid is so young. But is cute enough as a background to the main bullies-vs-kid story. I think Jackie Chan does a great role, and there is an interesting twist on his emotional pain.
B00447G2MK|3.0|Title says it all. They are more Pop influenced on this cd. Although, there lyrics are more optimistic rather than the f*** you attitude. Some songs are brutal, some songs could be compared to any Pop Punk band out there (All Time Low, We the Kings, etc) The songs that are Pop Punk, they are REALLY Pop Punk(go listen to It's Complicated and you'll see what I mean.) One of the major problems I have with this CD is that Jeremy's screams sound heavily produced compared to there passed releases..Almost sounding fake. Jeremy definitely focused more on his singing on this CD. You can tell A Day To Remember put work into this CD, and they should get credit for it. Give it a listen.
0767840135|5.0|I liked it since 1999 when I saw by tv. Later I purchased the DVD movie, and every time I watch it I enjoyed it as the first time. What  wonderful must be to see it by Blu-ray with better resolution. My first dvd was damaged owing to continued use so I had to buy a new one. The show is very beautiful. It shows us the adult people many times we forget about our children. We leave alone and scared our children. It is an emotional way to see the mistakes of adult people with their sons. Jhon Gilkey's playing is really spectacular. Music is very very nice. You cannot lost the opportunity to watch this spectacular circus show.
B0030Y11XS|5.0|Michael Moore poses the question : Why are capitalism and democracy so intertwined that mentioning one without the other is heresy and that even fiddling with or fine tuning capitalism is un-American . The answer seems to be that the very wealthy want it that way . The hard work ethic is a nice little piece of Americana  ,but the fact is people who work the hardest make the least amount of money . Hard work doesn't make money ....money makes money . The American dream .. life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness seems to have been high jacked by banks and corporations .<br />This movie is an equal opportunity offender . Both dems and the GOP get ripped to shreds . Christopher Dodd is made mince meat of . Reagan is presented as a corporate spokesperson  , Pelosi is portrayed as an aider and abettor and Bush is quite accurately portrayed as a moron . The people that get hit hardest are bankers - Schkeevatsos like Goldman Sachs CEO Hank Paulson  ...in fact the only person that comes out looking good in all of this is good old FDR .<br />It's a fun look at our economic system and how we accept ideologies and principles we've had drummed into our heads from the time we're 5 years old .<br />The best scene in the movie :<br />A scene from Franco Zeffirelli's Jesus Of Nazareth .<br />Cripple : I am a cripple , I have been like this for 20 years<br />Jesus : I can not heal your preexisting condition .<br />hysterical ..until you realize that that is how corporate America views us peasants .
B00428ZRFE|5.0|It's been 5 years since Rihanna came on to the scene with Music of the Sun. I was just a senior in high school. She has come along way since then. It went by so fast as I see Rihanna change, grow, and evolve into a beautiful, confident artist.Loud follows the traditions of popstars going from darkness to lightness. Janet (The Velvet Rope-All For You), Madonna (Erotica-Bedtime Stories), Christina (Stripped-Back To Basics), and Britney (Blackout-Circus). After listening to Loud and Rated R, it's definitely her best since GGGB but I enjoyed listening to Loud more than I did with Rated R. Don't get me wrong. I love the whole dark theme on Rated R, but Rated R started out really good but then it got weaker with songs such as Cold Case Love, Photographs, and The Last Song I enjoyed listening to the ballads on Loud more than I did with Rated R. I would have enjoyed it more if it was more consistent. I feel that Loud has the better ballads, but some of it's lyrics fall short. Rated R had some of the best experimental best sounds. It's really frustrating for me as a listener, but I would still prefer Loud over Rated R with the ballads and would consider it her best album.  It's getting to be as good as Good Girl Gone Bad. I think Loud is fitting for a title...everything is colorful and vibrant including her red hair! In my opinion, her vocals sounded the best on this album. There is only one song on this album that I didn't really cared for as opposed to the 4 songs on Rated R. I'm glad to see my RiRi recovered from what happened to her last year and she's doing extremely well. I'm really proud of her and this album.<br /><br />1. S&M (4.5/5)- it's a good dance track, but I'm not feeling the sleaziness right now. i prefer Rude Boy. Plus, it's all been done before. The whole bondage thing (*see Erotica and Discipline). The lyrics sounded weak as well.<br /><br />2. What's My Name (5/5)- it's a bit overplayed to the point I would hear it everywhere I go...in class, on the bus, on the radio, at the hair salon, etc. Still it's a very catchy, flirty song to sing along to.<br /><br />3. Cheers (Drink To That) (5/5)- this song is such a positive song. Don't let the bastards get you down. I love how she includes Avril Lavigne's sample in it. The song itself is very Alanis Morrissette.<br /><br />4. Fading (5/5)- very urban. nyc and dance-themed movies come to mind. has a nice touch to it.<br /><br />5. Only Girl (In the World) (5/5)- this song takes me back to her good girl gone bad days. this song is so sexy. i'm sure every girl out there wants their special person to make them feel like the \\"only girl in the world\\".<br /><br />6. California King Bed (5/5)- it's a beautiful song. best ballad on the album and one of her best she has put out! it's such a nice change from what you hear on the music charts right now. it's certified to be a hit. good job, rihanna!<br /><br />7. Man Down (5/5)- it's very old school reggae. i like to think of it as her own version of \\"i shot the sheriff\\". i enjoyed her \\"rum pum pum..rum pum pum\\"<br /><br />8. Raining Men (5/5)- it's a nice throwback to Beyonce's diva. although it does not bring anything new to the table, it's fun and catchy.<br /><br />9. Complicated (5/5)- i was really amazed how rihanna sounded so well on this track. i can relate to some of what the lyrics are saying.<br /><br />10. Skin (5/5)- i wasn't so fond with it at first, but it eventually grew on. it has plenty of sex appeal. it makes a nice striptease song.<br /><br />11. Love the Way You Lie (Part II) (2.5/5)- i got easily bored listening to this song. i don't think that this is eminem's best song. it just doesn't top his other song \\"stan\\"on the radio, at the hair salon, etc. Still it's a very catchy, flirty song to sing along to.<br /><br />3.

B00428ZRFY|3.0|`Quiet' would have been a far more appropriate title, since aside from the highly misleading first single, Rihanna's fifth album is filled with ballads and mid-tempo jams. This is not the first time in recent years that this type of bizarre irony has appeared in the music industry; Pink's last album also had a raucous lead single and boisterous title, neither of which had anything to do with the slow, somber remainder of its tracklist.     It's confusing why artists are suddenly choosing to promote and title their album based solely on the lead single, particularly when the single is loudly divergent from past work. It generally gets fans hyped up for a specific sort of theme or style, so needless to say certain expectations can be built up. `Loud' fails to meet any expectations fans likely had after hearing the extremely upbeat electro-pop of single \\"Only Girl (In The World)\\" and leaked track \\"Who's That Chick,\\" the latter of which is tragically absent on the album. In fact, `Loud' doesn't differ spectacularly from album four, `Rated R,' although ironically it has even fewer upbeat songs, and is expectedly less moody in tone.     Sex seems to be the elephant in the `Loud' room, with several of the 11 tracks being dedicated fully or partially to the act and its many variants. \\"Disturbia\\" retread \\"S&M\\" finds Rihanna snarling \\"I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it, sex in the air, I don't care, I like the smell of it\\" as she celebrates the joys of sadomasochism, while the slow-burner \\"Skin\\" pretty much speaks for itself. Second single \\"What's My Name?,\\" produced by Stargate and also about sex, features Drake and mostly serves its purpose with its syrupy smooth chorus and honeyed vocal come-ons; it's one of the album's few major standouts.     \\"Cheers (Drink To That)\\" makes unexpected use of an Avril Lavigne sample to decent effect; in spite of its lyrics being celebratory of partying and the weekend, however, the song isn't particularly upbeat and is much more ofa slow-groove jam than its title and topic would suggest. Things slow down even more with \\"Fading,\\" arguably one of the most successful ballads here, which is shockingly reminiscent of an Enya track at its beginning.     By the time \\"Only Girl (In The World)\\" makes its way into the tracklisting it sounds jarringly out of place, sandwiched between two ballads and the only song of its type on the entire album. It also happens to be, by far, the brightest and most exciting offering on `Loud,' and leaves listeners wondering what could have been if Rihanna had dug at least a little deeper into these hard dance beats and soaring vocals. The track that follows, \\"California King Bed\\" is, in spite of its strong vocals, limp, mopey and a total buzzkill.      \\"Man Down,\\" a wonky reggae romp that makes use of very \\"Unfaithful\\"-ish metaphors, isn't much better, but finds Rihanna heavily rediscovering her Bajan accent. \\"Raining Men\\" is extremely typical hip-hop fare featuring Nicki Minaj and continues the album's steady decline in quality. Thankfully things perk up a bit with \\"Complicated,\\" an emotive power ballad with a unique mid-tempo electronic beat.     \\"Love The Way You Lie (Part II)\\" may or may not have been entirely necessary, considering how overwhelmingly omnipresent the original song was all summer, but it retains its strong hook and appeal in this new version, although it doesn't particularly outdo the original. It also further muddies the assumed theme and message of the original, which will undeniably and needlessly fan the controversy's flames even further. On an off-note, however, it is a nice alternative for non-rap fans who enjoyed the original song's chorus, particularly the piano version featuring just Rihanna, which is a bonus track on certain editions.     `Loud' is definitely not what it could have been or was expected to be, offering a dishearteningly small number of strong additions to the chanteuse's catalogue. It may, however, be a necessary placeholder between the moody darkness of `Rated R' and the Rihanna of the future-hopefully we haven't seen the last of that supremely genuine smile and upbeat tone of the \\"Who's That Chick\\" video.
0800141849|4.0|I placed the order, got the movie shortly thereafter, end of story.  Used DVD was in good condition as promised.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|True collectors and people who appreciate this movie will purchase it however many times they may need to to get the version or media that they want.  I have the original DVD version and will buy the extended version as well (blu-ray).  Whenever the option to buy it digitally comes around, I will get it then too.  For those who are disappointed with their versions, sell them and just wait for the version you like.  Another good idea is from another reviewer who said to rent it for the scenes you want.  There is a reason for product descriptions and that is so you don't get what you don't want.  If the product says nothing about a digital copy then don't get it.<br /><br />This is a good movie, despite what others may say.  Sure it may have a lot of previously seen plot points but then again what movies nowadays doesn't.  I have Ferngully and while there are similarities I still believe Avatar to be the best.  It is like saying that any movie that came before Gladiator is better at the Rome setting and Colossium visuals. (This is another movie I have multiple copies of in different media.) Sure Spartacus is good but I love Gladiator better. There have been many before Gladiator, dealing with the whole sand and sandals theme but none come close.<br /><br />All in all, if you saw Avatar in the theaters and was struck with the notion that you had to get the movie A.S.A.P. like I did, then get this move but if you feel like waiting for a version that has a digital copy and all the bells and whistles then wait.  The choice  is yours.
B004B2P20Q|5.0|Bruce Springsteen and his amazing E Street Band heard in all of their 70's glory on the best batch of 'throw away' songs ever to be left off of an album! This is an amazing set of songs that stand on their own. It is like walking into the record store on a crisp autumn morning in 1978 and picking up the new double LP from the best band on the planet. The song 'The Promise' is in my opinion one of the Boss' 10 best singles. It is hard to believe that it didn't make the cut back in 78. We get treated to a massive collection of songs that speak to middle to lower class America and embrace us in our shared rollercoaster ride of life. No matter how personally wealthy these guys have gotten from their music careers, they play and sing for everyman. As I listened to these songs, I felt so many variant emotions. One minute my heart is racing and in the next moment my heart is breaking. Bruce has always made me feel as if it wouldn't be weird at all to just meet him down at the pub and talk and laugh and debate and argue and agree just like any two working class stiffs would do. He and the E Street boys are in the business of making magic for the everyman. They make me remember when but at the same time help me to glimpse into the future never quite sure of where and what but baby with these guys by my side, am I ever going to enjoy the ride. Please do yourself a favor today and purchase this 'new' classic from America's greatest rock band! Fall in love with these songs like I have by letting down your guard, putting your problems aside and let them sink into your soul and into your heart. Hail Hail to The Boss and his E Street Band!!!
B00454U1NS|5.0|I love me some Pink so when I first heard that she was coming out with a Greatest Hits cd I became super excited, but when I saw the track listing I soon became sort of disappointed. Why you may ask. Because of her exclusion to some of her hit songs from her first album \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" (yes people, before her album \\"Missundaztood\\" which had songs like Get This Party Started, Don't Let Me Get Me, and Just Like a Pill she had another cd). If you haven't heard her album \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" go and listen to it and I'm sure you will love it. On that cd she had hits like \\"There You Go\\", \\"Most Girls\\", and \\"You Make Me Sick.\\" Even though the song \\"There You Go\\" is included on her Greatest Hits cd the other two are not. That cd (\\"Can't Take Me Home\\") is a little different from all her other cds. It has a more R&B feel to it whereas her other cds are mostly pop and punk rock. Even though the R&B style isn't her (Pink reference to that on her song \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" when she says, \\"LA told me you'll be a pop star all you have to change is everything you are) I felt like she simply abandon that on this Greatest Hits cd. It's not like people didn't like that R&B style (her album \\"Can't Take Me Home sold more than 2 million copies). Some people became instant fans of hers because of her first album and not by her second cd which was Missundaztood. Even though those songs were omitted from the cd, it still is a great Greatest Hits album nonetheless. I love Pink. Always have, always will!

1401227821|4.0|This is a recopilation of several covers made by Adam Hughes at DC Comics.  The book mainly include covers of his works in DC in the series: Justice League of America (80s), Wonder Woman and Catwoman (my favorite covers from the book).  It's a great coffe table book with a few words from Adam and mostly covers (like you may expected).
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I love RiRi, as she is affectionately called around the way, this album reminds you of the growth and formula created by her team that captured us five years ago but catupulted her to stardum with \\"GGGB\\".  The sound of \\"LOUD\\" is great but that is simplfying the work that Rihanna has put into this album. She is the image of a pop star with the ability to have you buy into her sound. Her voice is not strong but her look and appeal is different than the average pop star psuedo/rock chick who sings relentlessly about broken hearts, cheating and revenge. Loud is about nothing and everything.  Her lyrics don't push you far but they make you happy to dance for hours and become reflective of what is acceptable for female pop artist.  Its lets about being taken advantage of like Miley or bubble gum like Katy P or Taylor S or strange like Lady G. Her sound is not replicated by her pop counterparts.  Each song has its own theme that runs with a similar cord created by Rihanna's own special quality that is unique in her voice.  Her island twang is enduring over heavily laden tracks.  Whether you believe her sound was studio produced or created in some music boardroom you cannot deny her attractive quality of balance between vocal mediocracy and imagery a pop icon (i.e Madonna, Cher, Cindey Lauper etc)called Rihanna is born. Loud doesn't stretch her vocally but like Pop stars before her, Rihanna's sound resonates with young women, to stand and be seen in songs like \\"What's My Name\\", dance with \\"Raining Men\\" featuring the nut Nicki Minja and fall in love with \\"Im the Only Girl in the World\\", be naughty with \\"S&M\\" or seductive and heavy like \\"Skin\\", reflective with ballads like \\"California King Bed\\", \\"Love the Way You Lie\\", or \\"Complicated\\".  She also ensures that her island reggae roots are infused into her albums which draws love from those back home and fans that have an affinity for reggae, like in the song \\"Man Down\\". Say what you want Rihanna makes it known she is going to be around for a while and make you see \\"LOUD\\" and clear she is NOT a bubble gum pop artist.  Her voice will be heard through this album.
B0045DO8NI|4.0|I like this album because it allows me to have the Pink songs off her second and third albums, which I wasn't a fan of besides the radio singles.  The only song missing here is \\"You Make Me Sick\\" off \\"Can't Take Me Home\\" and the \\"Save the Last Dance\\" soundtrack.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|Darkness On The Edge Of Town was Bruce Springsteen's \\"comeback\\" record.  Put into exile for almost three years after his leap into superstardom with Born To Run over legal hassles, Mr. Springsteen emerged with what he refers to in to the deluxe editions notes as his samurai album.  Feeling the influences of the punk scene, he dispatched with Wall of Sound inspired production of Born To Run and went for a more leaner sonic landscape. In the original album, Mr. Springsteen's characters are no longer looking to escape their problems, they've giving up escape a long time ago. They are searching for answers to the situations they find themselves in. Optimism has been replaced by despair and cynism. \\"Badlands\\" is an angry anthem about never being satisfied with where you are in life. \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\" is about the struggles between a father and his angry son and \\"Factory\\" is about the drudgery of everyday life. Songs like \\"Something In The Night\\", \\"The Promised Land\\" and \\"Racing In The Streets\\" are about chasing a dream that one will probably never find. \\"Candy's Room\\", \\"Streets Of Fire\\" & \\"Prove It All Night\\" are about putting everything on the line for someone and having to constantly prove their devotion. The title song best sums up the album. People are looking for answers to the same questions, willing to pay the cost, but never find them. No matter how much time they search into the Darkness On The Edge Of Town, they end up in the same place.  The remastered version of the album cleans up the sound of the original cd and allows you to experience a more richer sound.  The unreleased tracks (also being issued separately as The Promise) show what a prolific and diverse songwriter he really is.  As he notes in the excellent documentary included here, many of these songs were left off because they didn't fit the mood of the album that he was trying to create.  It's amazing that an artist struggling to remain relevant at that point in his career would leave off sure fire hits like \\"Because The Night\\", \\"Fire\\" & \\"Rendezvous\\" to keep the integrity of his vision.  That type of move would almost be unheard in this day and age.  The three dvd's are worth multiple viewing especially the stellar bootleg concert from 1978.  This set is a definite luxury for any Bruce fan and not really for the casual one.re hits like \\"Because The Night\\", \\"Fire\\" & \\"Rendezvous\\" to keep the integrity of his vision.

B003ZDZ1WG|5.0|No matter what, on every album, it seems there's always at least one song that you instantly hit \\"SKIP\\" when it comes on. It's rare to find a CD where you absolutely love every track. The Band Perry's self-titled debut is that album.    \\"The Band Perry\\" is a promising start of a multi-talented group. They have solid lyrics and surprising melodies. My only regret is that the 11 tracks on the album are over too soon. I can't wait to see what comes out of these country crooners in the future.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|This is it? This is the album all of us Josh Groban fans have been waiting for for such a long time? There is no other way to say it --- I'm just really disappointed.    When I started out listening to this new album I was really excited in anticipation of Josh's great voice and lots of beautiful new songs. Well, that excitement and anticipation didn't last very long. It became clear after listening to just the first few songs that this album would be very, very different from his previous albums \\"Closer\\" and \\"Awake\\". Now, change doesn't necessarily have to be bad, but in this case it really is!    Half the songs sound like they were taken from a bad Andrew Lloyd Webber musical, the other half sounds ... I'm not even sure how best to put it --- too classical, maybe? Not classical in the same sense as some of the songs on \\"Closer\\" or \\"Awake\\" were (those albums boasted some really wonderful classical-sounding songs), but classical in the sense of \\"so boring I'm about too fall asleep\\". There is nothing that stands out about any of the songs on this album --- they are completely bland and interchangeable!    By now I have listened to this entire album several times, for the simple reason that I know that sometimes you have to hear a song (or album) more than once before you start liking it. In this case, however, I'm sorry to say that the songs do not improve with age, so to speak. In fact, there is not a single song on the entire CD that I really like, and that is something I never  thought I would EVER say about a Josh Groban CD!!!    I love, love, LOVE all of Josh's previous CDs, but where \\"Illuminations\\" is concerned I simply can't believe I actually paid money for this album ... :o(    Two stars for Josh's still-fantastic voice and the few halfway decent songs on the album, but that's all I can give here ...
B003WTE886|4.0|It's near impossible to hate Taylor Swift; that's like hating puppies and rainbows and unicorns.    As with her first two albums, Swift's latest, \\"Speak Now,\\" is filled with bouncy pop songs, that you can't help singing along to, about boys, first loves, and revenge.    Swift knows what she's doing and with \\"Speak Now\\" demonstrates that she is clearly a talented songwriter and will be around for a while.    And to all those out there who roll their eyes at the mere mention of her name I say, \\"Stop hatin'.\\" Though they aren't the most meaningful of songs, Taylor Swift is cute, bubbly, and fun, and the high-school girl in me will continue to bop her head and sing along with the pop princess as long as she continues to make bad dating decisions and write about them.

0061997811|5.0|Yule Ball Programs. Hogwarts Acceptance Letters. Potion Labels. Educational Degrees. The Marauder's Map.    These are some of the things you get in this book, that is almost an encyclopedia about the movies. The book cover itself is embossed with pictures of some characters in the Harry Potter franchise. The first page makes it look like a Hogwarts student's book with a place for you to write your name, class and year. Probably enjoyable to younger readers.     The book is filled with high quality photos of the cast, props, movie stills and other behind the scenes pictures. There are four introductions, one each by the three main cast members- Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint, and one by the produce, David Heyman.     The book is divided up by movies. Each section starts with a callsheet of the movie and if you look closely, you might be able to recognize what scene it is for. Whether these are real or fake, it still is a nice addition. Accompanying the callsheet is a note from the production designer, Stuart Craig's notebook, and the producer, Heyman's diary.     With some pages that fold out and all the novelty prop replicas like the Marauder's Map, Educational Degrees, etc. it makes the book an interesting read. Don't be intimidated by the amount of text. It's written with simplicity and if you really like Harry Potter, you would be able to read through the text while enjoying the large pictures.     The amount of information contained in this book is immense, and it will most likely take some time to really go through every detail of this book and to become a Harry Potter film geek.     I would recommend this book to any Harry Potter fan, as it is extremely informing and fun to read. And it has some novelty to it.
B001FB55L2|5.0|This 2009 film, with two Golden Globe nominations, addresses a current US problem, with proper sensitivity and excellent acting. In 2007, Captain Sam Cahill is preparing to leave for his fourth tour of duty with the marines in Afghanistan. His brother has just been released from jail for committing rape. The two brothers are very close, but their father, an ex-marine sergeant, a veteran of Vietnam, considers Sam a hero and his bother Tommy a failure.<br /><br /> While in Afghanistan, Sam's plane is shot down, the military assumes that he is killed, and informs his wife and two daughters that he is dead. However, he is not killed. He and a private are captured by Taliban soldiers and tossed and held for months into a dismal hole. Sam does all he can to persuade the private not to give in to the Taliban. He is firm for months. But the two are tortured repeatedly and horribly and Sam is forced by the Taliban to kill the private.<br /><br /> Back at home, his brother Tommy, well-meaning, changes his wasteful personality and does all he can to help Sam's wife. He remodels her kitchen and other parts of her house. He helps her, encourages her, and makes her and her daughters laugh. He goes to the woman he assaulted and begs her pardon. Sam's wife is impressed. After smoking dope together and having a drink, she kisses him. One kiss.<br /><br /> After months, Sam is rescued. He can hardly talk when the marines take him from his hole. When he comes home, it is clear that he is traumatized. He asks his brother about his wife: \\"Did you f**k her? Tell me. I understand. I forgive you.\\" He also blows up at his wife saying that she has been sleeping with Tommy. He yells at his kids. He tells his colonel that his family does not understand him.<br /><br /> What will happen between Sam's wife and his brother? Can Sam be helped? Can he improve his relationship with his wife, Tommy, his two daughters, and his father? What will be the relationship between him and the wife of the private that he killed? Was he a hero? What is a hero?te that he killed? Was he a hero? What is a hero?
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|Season One of \\"Sons of Anarchy\\" had me on board with episode one. I was thrilled when they were renewed for Season Two. Season Two had me speechless and captivated at the same time. Jemma's ordeal at the hands of enemies of the Sons was heartbreaking. It was the last episode, however, that I watched several times over the summer in anticipation of Season Three. I still hear Jax screaming as a boat speeds off in the distance...
B003YWUTJI|5.0|This CD is a delightful collection of songs. I especially love the duet with Willie Nelson singing the classic, \\"Baby It's Cold Outside\\". I can't forget to mention the song she does with Ray Charles & Dolly Parton. She has such an enchanting voice no matter who she sings with. I highly recommend this CD for anyone who loves Nora Jones.
B001QOGYBI|5.0|I would never have heard about this movie if it hadn't been mentioned in a tongue in cheek fashion in the book \\"True Prep\\" by Lisa Birnbach.  Intriqued at how an animated character could possibly be preppy, I watched the movie.  Boy, am I ever glad that I did.  This is really a stunny piece of work.  Wonderful story and the stop-motion animation is really quite something.  The details come through after you've watched it at least four times or so!  Certainly not just a movie for children.  You won't be disappointed.
B001E45XT4|4.0|I got these to replace a set of cheap Logitech headphones. In that regard, these are a big step up.    The sound quality is great for gaming, probably not as much for music. They get a bit tight after a few hours wearing them, even though they fit over the ear well. I find that I fiddle with the head band adjustment as the night goes on to move it off of pressure points. I think this is likely a problem with any headset that weighs anything. And it isn't any worse than other headsets I've had that are heavy. All in all, at the sale price they are really hard to beat. I think if the comfort was improved just a tad, they would be great! I really like that I can tuck away the Mic. for safety -- I have small kids 3 and 6 who are always handling the headphones and so far that feature has worked like a charm.
0312600844|5.0|You have to go back to 80s Updike for something this good.  It is literature that is actually enjoyable to read.
0446563048|5.0|Let me start by saying that after reading [[ASIN:0743291263 The Halo Effect: ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers]], I always approach business books very skeptically. I was delightfully surprised to read the very appealing story (more like a thriller full of drama and suspense) of Tony Hsieh and of Zappos.com. Tony Hsieh is very honest and real in describing his life events, and how a mixture of coincidence, luck, values, principles, faith, hard work and entrepreneurship ultimately lead Tony and his company to great success and happiness. I particularly enjoyed the Happiness Frameworks section at the end of the book, since I can really relate to them. Highly inspirational and highly recommended.
B000063147|4.0|Avenged Sevenfold did pretty good with this one, although i can not say it is my favorite album of theirs. That goes to \\"City of Evil\\", but it's a really great aslbum that has much louder vocals than the before mentioned album.
B003EYVXTG|5.0|This is an interesting film about an American subculture with a strict code of loyalty.  It showcases the importance of family, and how far the community is willing to go to protect their freedom.  The quality of acting is excellent.  The film vaguely, has the feel of a medieval culture, with its' emphasis on family loyalty, violence, retribution, and the courage of the heroine.  And this young woman, who seems to take her personal qualities for granted, is truly a heroine.  And the downhome music is outstanding and 100% American.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|I really do love this movie and the Blu-Ray pack was a great value. There were tons of extra features. I especially loved the \\"Black Sheep\\" music video. I personally don't even own a Blu-ray player but bought the pack anyway and I'm not sorry. When I finally do decide to pick up a PS3, I think Scott Pilgrim will be the first movie I pop in!    This is the perfect gift for anyone (guy or lady) who grew up in the 90's and isn't afraid to use his or her imagination. And for those who hate Michael Cera... don't worry, he's not really just \\"playing himself\\" in this movie. Truth be told, the secondary character played by Kieran Culkin steals the show! Enjoy.
B001HN694K|5.0|I have watched this movie several times now.  I really enjoy it.  I am fascinated by Tim Burton's work.  Johnny Depp is superb.  The Red Queen is awesome as is Alice and the White Queen.  I am 57 and don't know if this would be good for or enjoyed by your child.   I highly recommend it.

B00447G2MK|5.0|This is honestly one of the best rock CDs I've listened to in a while. Very few albums from this genre pull me in and keep me listening to the entire CD over and over again. This is the first one since Silverstein's \\"Arrivals & Departures\\" that has done that.(which is ironic because I first discovered A Day To Remember when they opened for Silverstein at a concert I attended a couple of years ago.)  Fans of ADTR since they first came out may not like the \\"mainstream\\" type of sound to some of the songs, but I love it. Every song is a great listen.     1. Sticks & Bricks - 4/5  2. All I Want - 5/5  3. It's Complicated - 4/5  4. This Is The House That Doubt Built - 5/5  5. 2nd Sucks - 3/5  6. Better Off This Way - 5/5  7. All Signs Point To Lauderdale - 5/5 (Personal favorite song on the CD)  8. You Be Tails, I'll Be Sonic - 4/5  9. Out of Time - 5/5  10. If I Leave - 5/5    If you're a fan of ADTR, Silverstein, Hawthorne Heights' first 2 CDs, Senses Fail, or any band similar to those, you must buy this CD. Outstanding CD all the way through!
0393061310|5.0|This book covers a broad view of human history and evolution of the human societies. As such, it opens one's mind in thinking broadly about all humans as a whole rather than having a narrow minded view and a clan based mentality. It makes you more compassionate and more understanding of other civilizations, and it makes a solid foundation for a lifetime of learning in this subject. In summary, it makes the reader a more well rounded and a better person as a whole. That is why I think it should be a required reading in every high school curriculum.
0205313426|5.0|Have you ever experienced a book that left you feeling gangly?<br /><br />I have read many technical books and prefer content to be concise and complete.  Typical content consequently often involves boredom and loss of interest.  Wording that adds to the subject but maintains attention is a fantastic find.  The unfortunate reality is often content fluff that adds nothing more than entertainment or reads like medical transcriptions.<br /><br />Content loaded with fluff leaves me feeling as if I have learned the subject's core but have been stretched thin on fully understanding anything outside the core.<br /><br />Imagine a doll made of rubber.  Content loaded with fluff expands the doll, but it is much like stretching its limbs instead of building the doll into a well rounded robust figure.  You are left with a doll that has worn its elasticity and covers more area, but it is hardly improved.<br /><br />The Elements of Style is a condensed set of rules and examples diagnosing tendencies in modern writing and how to cut them down to size.  Cutting content down isn't about removing all sense of individualism but rather respecting the reader's time providing them with what they want to know without fluff.<br /><br />Style is a different concept entirely.  There is no set of rules stating writing has to be boring, dull, or condensed soup.  This guide provides a good set of principles that allow you to convey your meaning and sound human.<br /><br />Respect your readers.  Write concisely with a great degree of accuracy and have fun with it.  Get this book and learn how you can deliver all of these things and be loved for it.
B003Y3MYWW|5.0|This is another in Decca's ongoing \\"bargain-priced\\" reissue program and it's an absolute stunner. Zoltan Kocsis's Bartok recordings, which originally appeared on Philips, received great reviews when they were released, and it's not hard to see why. The music is fascinating, and the playing by Kocsis is idiomatic, sharply etched and beautifully recorded. Beginning with the Bagatelles (disc one), many of which have a Debussyian cast to them, and closing with the op. 1 Rhapsody on the eighth and last disc of this set, the entire universe of Bartok unfolds for the willing listener. I was transfixed by many of the pieces, most of which I had rarely listened to or had never heard, despite my having a couple of Gyorgy Sandor's Vox LP's from decades before. There is an almost mystical pulse to much of this music; one thinks of Scriabin, but it's entirely different: formless but approachable. There are also things like the six Romanian Folk Dances, brilliantly programmed by Kocsis to appear after the mysterious Bagatelles, and the 27 short pieces entitled \\"For Children\\" which occupy an entire disc and while composed for learners are filled with charming surprises.    No wonder the previous incarnation of this box set ([[ASIN:B0009A41VA Zoltán Kocsis plays Bartók [Box Set]]]) received raves from piano critics like Jed Distler (10/10 on classicstoday) and from the Penguin Guide.    Brilliant!
B003L20IHE|3.0|Ben Sherwood's Novel THE DEATH AND LIFE OF CHARLIE ST. CLOUD pretty much describes this Hallmarky love and spiritualism showcase for teen idol Zac Efron. Craig Pearce and Lewis Colick adapted the book for the screen and director Burr Sherwood (known for his other films that are of this genre) stirs the whipped cream.  It is a pretty story with pretty people filmed in a pretty location (British Columbia) and the results are pretty predictable, yet when compared to the types of stories on film that flood the theaters at least this film has gentle heart and a lack of terror and horror and for that we should be pleased.<br /><br />Charlie St. Cloud (Zac Efron, who holds in own in this rather implausible role) is a highly regarded young sailor who is wins a sailing scholarship to Stanford upon graduation from high school. He is devoted to his younger brother Sam (Charlie Tahan) and his single mother nurse Claire (Kim Basinger - don't blink or you'll miss her very brief appearance in the film).  One night while Claire is on extra shift at the hospital Charlie and Sam are in an auto accident: Sam dies, but Charlie is resuscitated by paramedic  Florio Ferrente (Ray Liotta, in another very brief cameo).  Charlie is devastated over Sam's death and gives up his chances for a life by taking a custodian job in the town cemetery so he can be near a certain spot where he 'sees' and communicates with Sam every sunset - a life long promise to never leave his little brother.  Five years pass and Charlie's friend Alistair (Augustus Prew) - his only other friend Sully (Dave Franco, brother of actor James Franco) has gone into the military - tries to encourage Charlie to date, but Charlie's eyes fall on Tess (Amanda Crew), a fellow sailor from the past, and love begins.  Tess decides to take a long solo voyage in her boat and disappears.  Charlie meets the now cancer-ridden and dying Florio who gives him his St Jude medal and encourages Charlie to embrace life.  Charlie strikes out on a mission to find the missing Tess and the rest is pretty obvious.<br /><br />Though the story is heavy on the saccharine edge and strains credibility, the team of actors is very fine - especially Zac Efron, whose presence is on the screen in practically every frame - so the film ends up being endearing.  The cinematography by Enrique Chediak is gorgeous and the musical score by Rolfe Kent leans heavily on sad love songs. It is not a profound film though it does dip gently into the ideas of 'the beyond', but there is something about the honesty of it all that makes it s a satisfying evening of entertainment.

1439181780|5.0|The Power stands alone. You do not need to see THE SECRET or read the book that followed the movie. This book can be understood by any person ready for it's message. Rhonda shares the same messages that have been shared by many in the past. Her way of translating these messages helps the reader to see how anything is possible if you really want it. Her \\"Points of Power\\" at the end of every chapter gives you good tools to work with. She basically has written the notes for you. The book is easy to read and includes stories from or about those who have used these teachings to make wonderful differences in their lives. Rhonda has included quotes from the many teachers she has learned from and it's their messages she shares with us. This book is a keeper. Think of it as a reference to go back to over and over again.

B0044LK8J4|5.0|This is a unique Christmas album from a lovely band that does everything from 60's lounge to 90's jazz and writes their own lyrics in several languages. The lead singer has a very beautiful voice. But I digress. This album has some real gems, like \\"Do You Hear What I Hear?\\" originally on last year's Starbucks Christmas album. This is one of my favorite Christmas songs of all time now.    \\"A Snow Globe Christmas\\" has an island feel to it and \\"White Christmas: Part 1\\" is a beautiful, slow rendition that brings the singer's voice to the surface. They do lively versions of Santa Baby and Auld Lang Syne. I definitely recommend if you like jazzy Christmas music.

Beauty in one of its purest forms, if you ask me. Since this was the first album I ever bought of Concha and it touched me so hard from the very first minute, I dare to state that I never felt so connected to an artist from the start; Jeff Buckley being the former artist to hold this \\"personal trophee\\" ;-)
1400032717|4.0|This book provided an interesting view point that most of us don't consider. The story line was unique as well.  In my professional life I've worked with many individual with autism, and I could relate bits and pieces of the main character to real life people.  If this book were any longer I may of had trouble sustaining my attention, because I enjoy a book that flows and paints a picture without a lot of reasoning and explanation.
B000UZQI0Q|3.0|First, let me say that I loved Mistborn; it was one of the best fantasy novels I've read in years, and I went to buy Well of Ascension immediately after finishing it.  It was creative, fast-paced, had a lot of likable characters, and its plot was nicely self-contained despite obviously being part of a larger series.<br /><br />Well of Ascension was still enjoyable, but I felt like it fell far short of the original.  For one, it's much slower paced and there's a lot of filler material; it feels like the author only had enough ideas for a two-book series but wanted to make a trilogy, so the second book got stretched into two.  The result is several hundred pages of ultimately pointless political bickering, and Elend and Vin spend way too much time angsting over their relationship.  The author also repeatedly reiterates things he's said several times before, which I can only assume is to pad out space.  The pace finally picks up near the end of the book, and then we're treated to a very predictable ending that you've probably been expecting since sometime in the middle of the first book.<br /><br />Don't get me wrong, there are still a lot of enjoyable parts to the book.  Vin and OreSeur's interactions are always interesting, as are Vin and Zane's, but sometimes those just feel like treats that are inserted between blocks of Elend talking about political philosophy.  We also learn quite a bit more about how allomancy works and how the world is designed, but it's obvious that all of the big twists are being saved for the last book.<br /><br />One thing that I can't blame on the author, though, is the numerous errors that appear in the Kindle edition of the book.  It feels like a print copy of the original novel was scanned and run through OCR software, then only given a cursory once-over by a copy editor.  The book is filled with numerous glaring spelling errors; some of the more obvious ones include a few instances of \\"Ham\\" to \\"Flam\\" and \\"We'll\\" to \\"Weil\\", and there was even one instance of the titular object of the book being spelled as \\"Moll of Ascension.\\"  \\"Nervous\\" was so badly misspelled at one point that I can't even remember how the letters were arranged.  That all seems rather embarrassing for a big publisher, especially one that's bold enough to charge as much for the Kindle edition of the book as a new copy of the paperback.he titular object of the book being spelled as \\"Moll of Ascension.\\"  \\"Nervous\\" was so badly misspelled at one point that I can't even remember how the letters were arranged.

0765326353|3.0|The Way of Kings is both the introduction to a new world, the world of the series that Tor is doing everything they can to push forward as the next epic fantasy flagship, and the story of several men who are at the center of the rising storm. At the first of those, The Way of Kings succeeds admirably. What it fails to do, however, is to also excel in the tale that it tells; everything about The Way of Kings is a prologue, and that feeling is hard to ever lose.    Mind you, The Way of Kings does display quite a few of Sanderson's great strengths. Though I would not yet place Sanderson with masters like VanderMeer or Martin when it comes to either the feel or detail of his world, Sanderson's skills as a world builder are exemplary. Roshar, like his other creations, is not your generic medieval world, and what is so enjoyable about Sanderson's settings is that he actually tries to think through the implications of his decisions and then implements the results into every aspect of the book, from plot twists to diction.     At times, this can lead to a slight awkwardness - such as the curse Storm you! that is used a thousand times in the text and, while making perfect sense for the world, feels simply odd to read - the vast majority of Sanderson's decisions in the area are a great success. His ability to draw you into the world and then twist you about once you are there leads to several of his greatest moments, twists that are (in his own words, from Writing Excuses) surprising yet inevitable within the framework that he has constructed.    To give a small example, a king is killed in the prologue, and the assassin who kills him hears his dying words. The assassin regrets the killing and wants to pass the words on, so he writes them down next to the king's corpse. This makes perfect sense to both to the reader and the assassin, coming from outside the Alethi culture that the king is a member of. Alethi men, however, are not meant to be able to read, a fact that is brought up in separate circumstances several times. Later, a character brings up the puzzle of how and why the king learned to read.    So Sanderson's world building is great, and it's very enjoyable when he shows it off, especially in the one off interlude viewpoints that are scattered around the map. Unfortunately, the world building's integration into the main storyline is far from flawless. There are several info dumps within the narrative, and, though they are rarely long enough to be a problem on their own, they occasionally clutter action scenes or hinder the pacing as a whole:     \\"[Szeth] hit the ground in the midst of the soldiers. Completely surrounded, but holding a Shardblade.    According to legend, the Shardblades were first carried by the Knights Radiant uncounted ages ago. Gifts of their god, granted to allow them to fight horrors of rock and flame, dozens of feet tall, foes whose eyes burned with hatred. The voidbringers. When your foe had skin as hard as stone itself, steel was useless. Something supernatural was required.    Szeth rose from his crouch, loose white clothes rippling, jaw clenched against his sins...\\" (p. 28)    Sanderson is known for his magic systems and, in that respect, The Way of Kings does not disappoint. Though the magic is not as front and center as it is in, say, Mistborn, its impact is felt throughout the world and throughout the story. The quest for shards and plates - both of which, at first, appeared to me as something like Masterchief's armor and a Covenant Energy Sword, but I got over that impression soon enough - is both convincing and interesting, and Sanderson ingrains us with enough of the culture's morals and desires that when the relics come into question towards the end of the book the reader can feel the weight of the decision alongside the characters.     Sanderson's prose in The Way of Kings is nothing exemplary, but it's not trying to be, the ultimate goal more in line with a camera lense than a stained glass window. The action scenes are clear, flowing, and cinematic, and the atmosphere comes through strong at several moments, many of them when the highstorms are at their height and dust is swirling just past the windows. At the same time, Sanderson will occasionally repeat himself, leading to certain worldbuilding aspects (spren come to mind, in particular) being reiterated in almost the same words time and time again.     Of the three characters, Kaladin is the one with the most screen time. His story is well told and enjoyable, but it's crippled by the simple fact that every single beat of it is obvious from before the word go. Kaladin is the reluctant hero to the last detail, the man with newfound powers who's afraid of the responsibility they bring, the just and good leader faced with the deaths of his men. It's all well written, and the bridge scenes that pepper his narrative are excellent, but it's hard to get too wrapped up in the tale when every obstacle is so obviously only the most minor of setbacks.     Sanderson has said that each book in The Stormlight Archives will have one \\"main\\" character who will have flashbacks to their past throughout the book, and Kaladin's the man with the past here. The flashbacks are, like much of Way of Kings, interesting but ultimately inconsequential. There are a few very good scenes in his childhood, don't get me wrong, but none of it is unexpected, certainly not the kind of thing that you'd be lost around if you hadn't been given a blow by blow tour beforehand. So, in the end, it's something that's not unenjoyable but also not necessary - fine on its own, but, when placed in a book so filled with excess, one of the traits that conspire to slow the glorious march of Sanderson's world to a more stately crawl.    Dalinar is, like Kaladin, a familiar character. He is the noble lord, the man who will do what is right even if it kills him. What sets Dalinar apart from his fellow Noble Lords is the visions that take him with every highstorm, throwing him into a past place and time and instructing him of what to do in the present. Dalinar acts on what they tell him, but can never get over the fear that he is mad for doing so. Compounding the problem is his son, Alodin, who is convinced that their father is running their house into the ground. The tension between the two is the highlight of the arc, though some of the drama is dampened by the sheer amount of time spent on it. The dilemma is interesting, but Dalinar spends what feels like entire novels worth of text debating his sanity, flip flopping back and forth and announcing grand decisions only to renege on them, then perhaps renege on the reneging, then perhaps... well, you get the idea. Furthermore, the visions are never really resolved, they simply grow in scale, leaving us to try and guess their meaning and importance until the next thousand page opus.    The final main character is Shallan, and her chapters hold some of my favorite and least favorite aspects of The Way of Kings as a whole. Shallan is attempting to become the ward of world renowned scholar Jasnah, the king's sister, and, as such, her chapters involve more studying and contemplation than slashing power swords through breastplates. The change of pace helps the story keep from growing stale, and Shallan's character comes through perhaps the best of the three. Her storyline lacks the major upheavals of, say, Dalinar's, but the information uncovered is interesting and the relationships that develop feel natural and conflicted. Best of all are Sanderson's descriptions of her art, which colors her chapters beautifully and makes her immensely likeable, at least from my perspective.     Of course, it's also interesting to see that the person facing the far, far more minor decisions than our beloved Noble Lord also makes her decision in a bare fraction of the page's that he does - perhaps a novella rather than his seven volume saga. Still, a novella's worth of buildup is hardly rapid, and how much you enjoy Shallan's plotline will, in large part, depend on how much you are willing to tolerate character's debating over imaginary topics. Those sections are broken up by Shallan's wit, which is, to put it lightly, a mixed bag. Most of what she says is decently clever, but it's the kind of clever where you smirk for about a second, not the kind where everyone in the room starts guffawing - which, of course, everyone does. Every time. That's not to imply that there's nothing of real interest going on, though; Shallan's plotline has one of the novel's absolute coolest scenes about halfway through it, and the slow build leads to an excellent climax.     The final recurring viewpoint character appears only in interludes and shadows, which is a shame because it's in Szeth's storyline that Sanderson really plays to his strengths. Szeth's is a fast moving tale filled with obscured meanings and motivations, all made great by clever action and an ability to think through consequences in a way both understandable and unpredictable:    \\"Szeth-son-son-Vallano, Truthless of Shinovar, wore white on the day he was to kill a king. The white clothing was a Parshendi tradition, foreign to him. but he did as his masters required and did not ask for an explanation.\\" (p. 21)    Shallan's climax isn't the only great one. It's only at the end of the book that Sanderson really steps it up, but, when he does, it's impossible to miss the fireworks. The Way of Kings ends with a barrage of confrontations and twists that propelled everything that came before to new heights, validated some of the long waits, didn't quite validate some others, and was generally a more subdued version of the explosion of twists at the end of Mistborn, with the difference here being that the foundation Sanderson was building off of was even greater.     It's probably telling, though, that I said, for all three major plotlines, that the buildup was too long. It is, for each and every one of them.There are no truly wasted scenes in The Way of Kings, no six chapter sub plot that feels like a pure digression upon completion, but there is still far, far, far too much stuff hanging out in that gray area where, yes, it does give us a bit more insight to the character, but it takes up twenty pages, and when you do it again and again for this guy, and again and again for that guy, you've got a book that doesn't so much strut as stagger. The set pieces are all good - great, even - and the characters are generally good, the atmosphere's engrossing, all of that's where it should be, but there's simply too much book here. The world building was needed to establish the epic feel that Sanderson was going for, and it's the best part of the book, but it's hard to deny that the world building got tired, sat down, and smothered the main plot under its many, many, gratuitous layers of fat.     In short, I'm not saying that Way of Kings is a bad book. It's not. I'm not saying that Way of Kings is the best series opener since A Game of Thrones, because it's not. What it is, is a good, enjoyable book that's got some flaws, but also has plenty to love for fans of Epic Fantasy. Will Sanderson make The Stormlight Archive more than that? I suppose we'll have to wait and see.

I don't see how anyone can't watch this series and not be blown away... moved... mesmerized by how astounding this world truly is.  There's so much we don't see living in our giant concrete and glass monkey hives.  This DVD set lets us glimpse the beauty of areas where people haven't done damage yet.  It makes you want to be an environmentalist, if just to keep these regions pristine.  The footage of animals and how they live is... words really don't describe it.<br /><br />Mr. Attenborough is the man.  His narrative of this series is perfect and appropriate.  His voice brings the sense of father time taking you through the awesomeness of our world.  Can't think of anyone better.<br /><br />Pick up this series immediately.

So it appears that the price just means Dave gets WAY more money than he used to from each sale.  I am..er, I mean, was a Baldacci fan...but this is like paying someone to slap me in the face and convince me I like it,   If this is the way the Ebook world is going then I'm OK to write ebooks off as a failed experiment.

B001IBIHQ4|5.0|Before beginning to watch this mini-series I was sketical due to some of the negative reviews I had read. I strongly disagree with those reviews after viewing the entire series.    Simply put I believe this should be reviewed by anybody concerned with the sacrifices our men and women in the serice have made in the past and currently. This movie is a record of the grim realities of war and the price that is paid for freedom. This movie illustrates not only the physical sacrifies made by the men and women in the military but also the psychological and emotional sacrifies and wounds endured.  The truth of it is the images and the reality of the film are not pleasant but they express in an incredibly vivid way how honored our country is and has been to have men and women willing to make the ulitmate sacrifice.    Thank you to everyone who has served in the past and is serving today!

B00005JK8K|4.0|I thought this was a good movie, Nicholas Cage is a very very talented actor.  That's probably the only reason why I wanted to watch this movie.  He does the part very well.  As far as the scenes go, it's nothing new from your old WWII movie.  There are better ones out there with better storylines, but it does well enough.  It's like Saving Private Ryan but with Nicolas Cage.  I think if Saving Private Ryan starred Cage, instead of Hanks, it would have made a way better movie.  Not saying it's bad, but Cage does his part better than Hanks did.  All in all, I would say it's worth watching.

B003SWNRU2|5.0|This is the best album I have bought in a couple of years! The music is amazing, the lyrics are full of emotion and what can I say about Frank Tornillo's voice besides, WOW!  I haven't heard anything this spot on for heavy metal in a long time.  I'm old school and I like to hear the words. No problem here, these guys keep you on edge and wanting more throughout the album. Outstanding album, I hope they get several Grammy's for it, because they damn well deserve it!
B0040JHWKS|4.0|While, undoubtedly, this album is touted as what would have been, I just can't buy into that theory.  Yes, some great tunes here back in his prime (although he has re-done several of them here for this release either because of being unfinished and / or lacking vocals).  But, this is no 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' to be sure.  These are the songs that Bruce decided not to put on the album at the end of the day.  I'm still glad he chose the songs he did for that album because it's a killer album and, for me, rivals any of his other work out there.  I love 'Born to Run', but I also love 'Darkness on the Edge of Town'.  If any of the songs from 'The Promise' had been the songs to make it to the final cut you really have to wonder where his career path would have taken him.  You can't go back.  You can always second guess yourself and in hindsight 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' is a great stand alone album and deserves the attention it gets.  For all Bruce fans out there you will not be disappointed with this release since it's Bruce singing or re-singing these left behind tracks.  I can't say that there isn't anything not noteworthy on this album so everyone should be pleased with the end result. Whether or not, all the songs are in the order that they should be in order to flow together or not is a matter of personal opinion.  I just consider it another solid release for the most part from Bruce, one that probably should have followed on the heels of 'Darkness on the Edge of Town' instead of having to wait 22 years.  But then again???
B002HFJ77S|5.0|This book is just Laugh-out-loud hilarious! I strongly advice not reading it in public that is if you don't mind bursting out in laughter all by yourself. This book will definitely brighten a bad day at school or work. Lara makes a fun-loving comical character and with her ghost aunt Sadie they're perfect. As typical with Kinsella's books the main character faces reality and has to change her ways in order to find happiness. This, to the delight of the reader, doesn't occur without hilarious and awkward situations in which many can relate. As with Kinsella's characters Lara and Sadie have traits which anyone can have making for a more enjoyable read. To my delight I found this book to have a bit more substance than \\"Remember me?\\" or \\"Can You Keep a Secret?\\" making \\"Twenties girl\\" my all time favorite from Kinsella's books. Overall this book will definitely brighten your day making it a great present for anyone including yourself.

B0018RWD6I|5.0|John Coltrane, is one of the true masters of jazz, he is as Dr. Earl Ofari Hutchinson and many others would say an ICON. He puts together a blend of music that can only be described as phenomenal. When you sit down and listen, you are mesmerized.    The album only has four tracs, however isn't quantity, it's quality. This is an album to listen with somebody, perhaps your significant other. It will definitely put you in the mood.    Like Sgt. Pepper, What's Going On, and Bitches Brew, this album ranks up there with the others as some of the greatest recorded works ever produced.    John Coltrane made his transition on July 17, 1967. Like the maker's of the other albums mentioned here, Coltrane was a genius.

0156027321|2.0|Don't believe the hype on this one!    Unless you are looking for a philosphical or spritual awakening this is not the novel to read.  It is incorrectly marketed as an adventure in the Robert Louis Stevenson or \\"Old Man and the Sea\\" tradition.  Supposedly, the adventure involves an 8-year-old Indian boy trapped on the lifeboat from a downed ship where the only inhabitants are himself, an orangutang, zebra, hyena and a tiger.  Pretty soon, there is only the boy and tiger remaining.    What should have been the premise for a highly unique high-seas adventure qucikly devolves into a spirtiual parable where the story the boy tells upon rescue may not even be the truth but a mere symbolic retelling of his search for God.  The boat sinking doesn't even take place until 120 pages into the novel.    Well written -but dull and ending abrubptly and in a quite unsatisfying manner.

B003UERZ88|5.0|The Metal God returns with the latest album from his self named solo band entitled Made Of Metal (cracker of a name that too!).  Here is another album that I was really looking forward to getting my hands on this year, albeit with some degree of reservation after what I consider to be a pretty average album in his last (metal) one Crucible.  Whilst that album did have some tracks on it that I like I feel that it fell far short of the standard normally expected from Halford.  It went in a direction that I was not pleased about at all with its chugging, plodding, heavier but ultimately boring riffs and screaming just for the sake of sounding aggressive rather than to vocally enhance the songs.  Early snippets of Made Of Metal that I got from Youtube and poor Amazon reviews did little to inspire me to rush out and get this album either.  Plus with the title song Made Of Metal having lyrics that made even me question its credibility - Nascar racing?  What is he thinking? Then the second song I heard entitled The Mower had the persistent screams, heaviness and chugging nature typical of stuff from Crucible, so I wasn't expecting much from the album at all, but being a Halford album I still bought it.<br /><br />I still had some reservations too upon hearing the lyrics of the opening track Undisputed with its boxing theme - what's with another song about sport?  But I soon found what a pleasant surprise this album has turned out to be!  This album will no doubt be somewhat of a disappointment for anyone looking for another Crucible,  those who want nothing but heaviness, speed and aggression from Halford.  But for the likes of me who grew up with Judas Priest in the 1980's this album is a welcome return to the kind of music that I loved so much but feared I would never hear again from Judas Priest or Halford.  Simply put it is heaven to my ears.<br />There is a mixed bag of styles on this album with the songs sounding like they could have fitted on The Halford album Resurrection (which I love) and also several Priest albums from 1978's Stained Class to 1988's Ram It Down.  However what these songs all have in common is what was at the core of Priest's appeal to me over two decades ago now. i.e. hard music, a great rhythm and beat, one of THE best vocalists ever, but underpinning it all was the melody.  Priest seemed to be one of the best at perfectly capturing the right balance of that mix, and Halford has done it again here.<br /><br />Sure this is not as heavy as a lot of music today, and it doesn't have the fast complex riffs, but music like this was considered heavy 25 years ago it still sounds tough enough for me today.  There are some simple but great riffs on offer here and good solos which are done to enhance the song rather than show how clever the guitarists are.  In essence it still packs a fair punch.<br /><br />Production on this album is pretty much flawless, much better than the mushed up wall of noise that was Crucible.  Each instrument is clean and easily distinguishable in the mix, but most importantly Halford himself is right out there so you can hear him clearly.  So often I gripe about the vocalist being too far back in the mix these days, but not here.  This is heavy metal music produced as it should be.  So hats off to Roy Z.<br /><br />With an album like this I could go on about individual songs, how good they are and why I like them, but I've gone on enough already so I'll just say that despite the sporting references Undisputed has grown on me so I now like it a lot, and so has the title track to the degree that I now rate it an absolute killer.  Then there's Speed Of Sound, the catchy We Own The Night, Hell Razor, Twenty-Five Years, Matador, and my ultimate favorite from this album Heartless.  Even the others not mentioned are by no means bad songs, I like them a lot too.  But the closer The Mower still remains the least appealing to me.  I'm a huge fan of Halfords high-pitched vocals, the likes of which sound great on Priest songs such as Victim Of Changes, The Sentinel, Devils Child, Painkiller and many more, but he overdoes it on The Mower and it sounds forced.  The album could have done without The Mower, but it is only one song, so this is still an album that really does it for me.Victim Of Changes, The Sentinel, Devils Child, Painkiller and many more, but he overdoes it on The Mower and it sounds forced.

B00003CXFV|5.0|Strong, emotional, at times pathetic, this film will let you enjoy a real case in its Hollywood rendering. The theme is not new, especially in the US where these disputes about the pollution created by industrial businesses end up all the time in front of a judge. The active woman who is going to fight for that case has three kids, has been married twice and she got divorced twice too. She is fighting for her independence and a motivation in her life in general and professional life in particular. The case is simple: an industrial factory pollutes the soil of a whole residential zone, knows it and hides it to the residents and even lies to them. That Erin Brokovich is doing the only work that can win a case like that: she canvasses all the people who have a reason to claim some damage. She gets them all to sign the document to go in front of a judge. In spite of not liking the procedure chosen by the new experienced associate of the firm she goes along with it and even finds a direct witness of the misbehavior of the business and of its concealing methods. That witness has even stolen some documents that he was supposed to destroy. That will bring an unexpectedly high result and Erin will get a nice check in the end. But Julia Roberts is excellent because she embodies a pugnacious lady that is both stubborn and effective, charming at times and uncompromising when necessary. She manages to win the heart of her son over, though he is young, the understanding and support of her third boyfriend who is going to be the third husband one day, and of course the case more than anything else. There is no real suspense in the film but the impersonation of Erin Brokovich by Julia Roberts is the real charm of the story.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID

B004BRP7R4|5.0|Josh Groban has always been a great singer.  What is really amazing is that after years of voice lessons he is noticeably better.  How could he improve what was already so great?  He managed.  Everything is clearer, purer, richer, better executed.  His lowest notes used to be his downfall & he sometimes struggled with them, but no more.  His higher range notes sound more relaxed, more powerful, clearer.  Unbelievable.  The one oddity, for a near-operatic baritone, is that he relies a great deal on falsetto, which sometimes works well, but not always.<br /><br />The sound on this album is just crystal clear, clean, awesome.  I've never heard anything sound so clean.<br /><br />Josh wrote 11 of the songs on this album, mostly with collaborators.  This is more than he's written before.  The songs include quite a bit of variety, with some sounding distinctly classical, others sounding more like folk ballads, and one (\\"The War At Home\\") sounding just a little bit country-ish.  The lyrics and sound are generally moving and thought provoking.<br /><br />The album is missing some of the more avante-guarde elements of some of his earlier albums -- and generally comes off as more traditional -- and yet not traditional.  His melodies always take unexpected twists.  His voice makes unexpected shifts in timbre.  Just as you think you're in familiar territory musically, suddenly you're not.  But the stuff he did with Mouquet and Heap in the past were more experimental, which is the one thing I really miss on this album, though \\"Voce Existe in Mim\\" has a bit of the quality of those prior works of Josh's.<br /><br />In the past, I saw him as part of an international community of fusionists who were working to fuse elements of all sorts of music together to form new sounds.  I saw him as the first mainstream new music composer; but this album isn't like that so much.  Its newness is more subtle.  It does not really sound like anything else that's been out there before, while not using any exotic elements.<br /><br />Josh is profoundly creative, one of the most revolutionary forces in music today, a real genius -- one who picks up the torch of classical music and moves it in new directions.  And, yet, there is that hypnotic singability of some of the choruses.<br /><br />Josh considers this to be essentially a \\"live\\" album.  Many songs were \\"one take.\\"  And, yet, you don't notice.  It is all apparently flawless.<br /><br />Instruments: predominantly piano and strings<br /><br />Comments about some individual songs -- all having a rich and soaring sound, BTW:<br /><br />Wandering kind: an instrumental piece composed by Josh when he was 12, with added musicians.

As a scientist, I find this offensive, as it seems to imply that scientists are not naturally human and that it's odd for us to be just like everyone else.<br /><br />L'Ora Dell'Adio: the most operatic of these pieces.  It really show cases the maximum magnificence of Josh's voice.  Lyrics in Italian.<br /><br />Hidden Away: the first released single of which there is an official music video featuring Miss Kentucky 2009.  This starts out with a very sweet, pop-like tone, but deteriorates into a sequence with many rough transitions between baritone and falsetto.  This is not my favorite one of the songs musically, but it's starting to grow on me.  It has a very nice message about trying to be positive and loving, rather than keeping warmth inside.<br /><br />Au Jardin de sans pourquoi:  I find this one particularly beautiful, though he does have a tendency to go back and forth over the same interval a lot.  Lyrics in French.  one of the few where Josh wrote the music alone, though it's considered a \\"cover\\" of another piece, presumably because of the words)<br /><br />Higher Window:  a very beautiful, but sad love song about a man who may have missed his chance after initially rejecting a woman.<br /><br />If I Walk Away:  This is a love song with a very catchy & singable chorus.  A fun one.<br /><br />Love Only Knows: Another one with a very catchy and singable chorus -- very hard to get out of my head, but leaving me with a feeling that this guy is ultimately going to get hurt.<br /><br />Voce Existe in Mim:  This is my personal favorite.  It has a huge sound with very unusual sequences, where the voice is not so dominant and the instrumentals are very strong.  This is probably the most experimental sounding one, and features a large all female drumming group.  Lyrics in Portuguese.<br /><br />War at Home: This one has a slight hint of country sound.  It's about soldiers who have suffered in war.  Josh wrote this after a visit to Walter Reed Hospital.  It's very, very moving -- very hard to get out of my head.  I predict that this is going to be the most popular out of this album.<br /><br />London Hymn: This is heavy on the instrumentals, with Josh blending in, very orchestral and choral. In Latin.<br /><br />Straight to You: a cover of a rock song by Nick Cave.  Well, if you're a rock fan, you won't like it.  If you're a pop/classical fan, you wouldn't like the original and will like this one much better.<br /><br />---------------------<br /><br />Addendum<br /><br />After listening to this at least five more times now, I am struck by a pervasive sadness about the thing.  It sounds like Josh's love life hasn't been going very well.  There is a sense of yearning in all the songs -- of pain, really.

B002N5N5LG|5.0|This is just a great show. The price was a bargain and the videos were so much fun to watch again. I watched all of them with the commentary \\"on\\" and it was pretty funny. The cast and crew were very entertaining in the commentaries and the big stars actually showed up for the commentary (as opposed to some OTHER commentaries... AHEM, I'm talking to you, \\"The Office\\"!). This show is fresh, funny, and creative. I actually enjoy the show more now that I've listened to the commentaries and know some of the rationale behind Dan Harmon's brilliant choices.    I watched 'em all and then shared the discs with friends. It's like my Firefly DVDs-- they're evangelization tools! I really recommend this funny and creative show that still has the excitement that comes from being hungry for success!
B004B4JGHE|3.0|Another good Keith Urban album, but 8 songs is not enough. When I first saw how short the track list was, I had hoped he was getting back into extended outro's again, but I was wrong. It seems 30 minutes is the mark to hit these days with new albums. An indication of the music industry's condition. Support the artists by seeing them live.
B0044XV3QY|2.0|*** Be advised, Abrahamic themes discussed here ***    Technicals aside, Avatar appears to be Cameron's take on how the biblical Book of Joshua might play out allegorically but reversed and depicted as science fiction. Imagine a fantasy where the alien, \\"pagan\\" enemies of some futuristic, space-faring \\"Israel\\" instead have the righteousness and might of the \\"true\\" deity on their side. In his cinematic brilliance, Cameron shows just how this futuristic, figurative \\"Israel\\" is brought to its knees by its would-be alien (figurative biblical pagan) targets. The humans are snarkily depicted as claiming the superior means and values, yet in this fantasy they are THE god-forsaken, rapacious foreigners - in the eyes of the pagans.    The blue Na'vi in the movie appear to represent a fantastic version of the ancient, partly-human Anakite giants (Anakite: long-neck) of the biblical land of Canaan, metaphorically represented here by Pandora. Since the movie is from the human traitor Jake Sully's (alternate biblical Caleb) and his alien allies' POV (Sully: \\"Excuse me, this is my video log here!\\"), there is of course no attribution to any kind of divine hand behind this metaphorical Israelite army. OTOH, it is a force which does possess a thematic proxy for the power of the human (biblical Israel's) deity, in the form of unimaginable - in the eyes of the pagans - advantages in armaments, high technology, and organization. Not coincidentally, the human (biblical Israeli) army is depicted transiting the wilderness of space from a blighted Earth (biblical Egypt) while subsisting on in-flight rations (biblical manna), bent on an overarching mission to seek their nation's survival and prosperity by winning the rights to the promised rock (biblical land) of Pandora (biblical Canaan). The idea of \\"Israel\\" as the divinely favored people is figured in the movie as a powerful human civilization aspiring to \\"Unobtanium\\", a \\"Rock\\" no less, which in the end proves to be unobtainable due to alien enemy action. Which is precisely Cameron's point, and likely motivation.    After being forced to take a swim (biblical Jordan) by the nasty wildlife (biblical \\"land swallows up people and things\\"), ex-Marine (Israelite warrior) Jake meets Na'vi princess Neytiri, a figurative stand-in for the ravishingly beautiful biblical Rahab. In this tale, Rahab's biblical character as fearful prostitute is uplifted into a stalwart and loyal Na'vi (biblical Canaanite) princess. Rahab's biblical role as the Israeli sympathizer who hid the two Israeli spies scouting Jericho is smartly reversed into that of a die-hard noble pagan defender and seducer. This version of Rahab also plays a secondary role as that infamous Moabite princess who carried out the orders of biblical Canaanite king Balak (paralleling the biblical advice of the pagan sorcerer Balaam not to confront Israel indirectly) to seduce an enemy Israeli warrior into betraying his own nation. Instead of getting speared in the act with said enemy (biblical Phinehas/Zimri incident) as in the original story, this revised Rahab-cum-sex-princess does get to turn the tables by spearing the enemy Colonel, who appears to stand for biblical Joshua due to his age and character (Yes, yes, I know that the original production code-name for the Jake Sully character is \\"Joshua\\"). The Neytiri (biblical Rahab) character ends up as a fantastic re-imagining of the ancient pagan war-goddess Neith/Anat - she of nakedly aggressive beauty and skill with bow and arrow. A sneaky reversal of an Old Testament story marvelously retold from the Canaanite point of view.     Among other things, Pandora/Canaan's magical floating mountains are metaphors for those ancient mountaintops from where biblical King Balak and Sorcerer Balaam tried to hex their Israelite enemies. It's a bit of a thematic stretch, but these can also represent the high places where Israelis would not only practice worship, but more importantly also seal holy covenants, or marriages between entities. On the other hand, the offsite Avatar link couch assigned to Sully is revealingly named \\"Beulah\\" (Dr. Augustine: \\"You'll be in the link at the end. Unit one. Beulah...\\"), which means \\"Israel\\" and/or \\"married\\" in Hebrew. Hebrew prophets were always warning Israelites against marrying irredeemable aliens. The prophets particularly condemned syncretic corruption involving divinity marriages between the Hebrew God YHWH and pagan goddesses such as Asherah, whose domain was trees and was symbolized by the presence of wooden poles, carved wooden figures, and trees. Of which stuff the figurative pagans have more than a little of. So in this reversal, an \\"Israelite\\" turns against his nation and people when he marries into a rival enemy \\"alien religion\\". Cameron must have been chortling as he thought this one up.    The age of the elder chief scientist Dr. Augustine and and her expertise in botany marks her character as figurative of the first failed biblical spy team which was tasked by Moses to scout biblical Canaan's agriculture. Sully is buddied in a paired spy-team just as in the original story. We have a fantastical re-creation of the biblical Canaanite mother goddess Asherah, associated with the living tree of fertility and child-sacrifice rites and enemy-god to the biblical Israelites. Not to mention sex in the pagan commons under a tree - are no private quarters available to the aliens? The merging-of-braids-and-minds depicted in the Collector's edition follows the sex-religion aspects of the ancient Asherah pagan cult, which saw public sexual union in the grove as more of a spiritual rather than physical consumnation. And like the biblical OT pagans, these fantasy aliens do practice sexual rites at those high sacred places. It was predictable, and predicted.     Other reverses/parallels abound. The treasonous human science team almost directly parallels the ten faithless spies of biblical Moses's 12-man spy team, of whom only biblical Joshua(figured as an older Joshua by RDA Colonel Quaritch here) and Caleb proved strong and faithful (Colonel Quaritch to initially-zealous Sully: \\"I wish I had ten more like you\\"). Then there are the 12 RDA sectors which figuratively correspond to the biblical distribution of land among ancient Israel's twelve tribes. And there's marine (biblical Israelite) warrior Jake Sully as a traitorous refiguring of the biblical Caleb, except that Caleb's character is recast in the form a traitorous brother. It is yet another OT parallel from Deuteronomy, for the enemies of biblical Israel are sometimes described as \\"undercut\\" with crippled legs. Jake Sully's role as crippled traitor-to-be is strongly predictive of this, for in this reversed parallel fantasy, he gets to meet pagan Princess Neytiri (biblical Rahab) at Hometree (biblical Jericho), which eventually falls to the circling human army (biblical Walls and Trumpets assault).     In other details, alien wildlife are seen communicating with the indigenes (Balaam's biblically hilarious donkey). And oh, up there during the climactic battle is a naked and feathered Jake Sully with a crown of thorns sailing the sky on the back of a serpent-tailed red dragonbeast, holding at times a serpentine twist of hair-fiber and looking for all the world like your typical illustration of the biblical Canaanite gods Astaroth/Ashtoreth. Neopagans everywhere, rejoice!     As for the biblical Ark which brought down Jericho's walls on the seventh run after circling the city 6 times, figuratively substitute Shuttle 1-6 and its humongous daisycutter bomb as proxy for the presence and power of the biblical Hebrew deity (biblical YHWH-on-the-Ark). Watch as Cameron delightfully orchestrates the onscreen failure of the daisycutter/Ark to deliver the final providential blow, while the supposedly unaligned Eywa-mother-earth (Neytiri: \\"Our Great Mother does not take sides Jake\\") finally does the Abrahamic God Divine Intervention routine. It's pagan catnip,I tell you.    Cameron's counter-biblical SF fable even has some mocking humor. Go over the movie segment where high executive Parker (biblical high priest Eleazar) is looking down at imagery of Pandoran (biblical Canaan) sector 12 on the holotable. Yes, that's Twelve, which is metaphorical for the OT tribe of Benjamin from which the future hebrew messiah would descend. Parker then revealingly/mockingly comments, \\"Stop... Where .. Stop. Jesus... ...I mean, look at all that cheddar...\\" (Google hint: Cheesus). Marvelously allegorical mocking word-play! For the many post-modern/ post-Western/ post-Christian/ cryptomystics out there this is as good as it gets.    Avatar is full of parallels and strong metaphors, some not obvious yet others blindingly so given the narrative order and context. How to explain all that Cameron wrought, and why? Well, we know that Cameron has this thing about disputing biblical stories. We also know what he did say about his 2006 biblical-sort-of documentary The Exodus Decoded: \\"...Exodus is a story we all know. We were all raised with a biblical view of the world, which still has a resounding influence on Western culture...\\" \\"...Here, we've found evidence that may set the Exodus clock back 200 years. We can shove this film in the experts' faces and start a dialogue. History is often told by the victors. It is edited by subsequent rulers, who chisel away at it to show themselves in a better light. History is a moving target, and we should not be afraid to be provocative about it...\\" Tellingly, this contentious Discovery Channel whodunnit was his last major project prior to Avatar.    If today's neopagans could somehow revise the original OT story into a fantastical triumph for those old Canaanites in place of their historical defeat and conquest by the biblical Israelites, this movie is their gift. It seems Cameron is Speaker-for-the-Dead of all vanquished pagans, voicing ghostly wishes from beyond the grave for what could have been, but never was.    Excellent movie-making, though.
B002C6A6FY|5.0|Pretty much you can't!  Or at least that is how I feel.  Casablanca is one of my all time favorite Bogart films so I decided it was time to add it to my collection and I want not disappointed!
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|This story really is different in a lot of ways.  Once you accept that, it is really an enjoyable film.  And it fulfills what a movie is to me:  entertainment.
B0024RID6U|4.0|I had this LP when they toured the US in 1980 & saw 'em kick off the NE tour in my home town. Side 1 trots out the hit singles, Start Me Up, Little T&A, Hang Fire, Neighbors, & has some cool session work by Ernie Watts burning sax on Slave. Side 2 has some cool items outside of the \\"tired\\" hits that we were bludgeoned with like \\"Worried About You\\" \\"Tops\\" & \\"No Use\\" are nice soul numbers in the style of Don Covay which also feature Mick Taylor. In my opinion, its the soul #s that rescue this from being just an average Stones LP. The Stones work after Some Girls was spotty but there were some very good tracks burried on the 80s & 90's LPs....just too few & far away.
B001TH16DI|5.0|I've own multiple versions of Star Trek movies, from VHS to DVD, and this set the first week it came out. As Star Trek fan especially of the motion pictures, I watched multiple times for each of the media. The blu-ray has a lot of \\"cleaner\\" scenes (less grainy or none all-together) on a 1080p HDTV over DVD versions up converted. I wasn't able to hear the sound difference but then again I viewed them on a 5.1 room-size speakers.    It's definitely worthwhile to collect or to replace old media.
B001992NW4|5.0|The movie is very good. However, I was a little diasappointed in the clarity of the Blu-Ray. I thought it would be muche clearer.
B001V7YJMG|4.0|Very unique take on vampires and adolescent love. Kind of like a young \\"tweeny\\" version of HBO's \\"True Blood\\" meets Shakespeare's \\"Romeo & Juliet.\\" Definitely not the kind of vampires from the \\"Twilight\\" series. Ignore previous reviews - this version on Amazon has the correct English subtitles that were included with the theatrical release. Thought provoking, inspired acting and writing, and solid performances all around. I have also seen the American remake \\"Let Me In,\\" and if you are a fan of the original, you will not be disappointed with the remake, and vice versa.
B001PB3RU8|5.0|I depend greatly on reviews before deciding which albums to preview. When I see an album that has 30 or more reviews and 80+% are 5 stars, I take the 5-6 minutes to preview the songs.    It was time well spent for \\"Lungs\\". There are 13 unique, driving songs with excellent arrangements and a lead singer with a powerful voice. \\"Dog Days are Over\\" and \\"Drumming Song\\" are the two outstanding songs for me, but they are all good. Where else will you hear lyrics like \\"Kiss with a Fist\\"?    I downloaded the album earlier this year and am buying several CD's for Christmas gifts.    I can't tell what you will like, but you may want to consider previewing the album.     Enjoy
B004CD7OCI|5.0|I had thought the zombie genre was overdone, but this show proves there's plenty of life in it yet! Cast and production are flawless. The story is intriguing, tension filled, and very well written.
0762434260|1.0|The first package sent to me was defective. Nubs and srew ends were either broken off or stuck in the attachment hole and broken off, rendering it useless. The seller Brooks Books, made it right by sending some parts to other kits, which arrived today 11/29 and I was able to piecee together one wand from them.    However, I don't think I would recommend the product itself because, although the assembly idea is good the cheap plastic parts apparantly break easily.    At best, using it as a decoration is the only use, because it is so delicate.
B001UV4XFG|2.0|I enjoyed Eclipse, the book, but was not expecting a whole lot considering the first two movies. My first bone to pick is with the hair and makeup department. I did miss Rachelle as Victoria, but I like Bryce D Howard as an actress and she was good here, but who on earth put her in the hideous wig? Her real hair is much prettier. She looked like the love child of Bozo and Raggedy Ann. Jackson/Jasper's wig was better in this one than New Moon at least. Edward's hair has not been bronze (his trademark in the book) since the first movie. It's sad when Hardwicke, with virtually no budget, gets the hair and makeup the best out of the three. Rosalie/Nikki's wig was the best of the wigged cast. Bella/Kristen's wig looked like the one Jacob/Taylor wore in the first movie and Carlisle/Peter's wig looks like a hairspray helmet. These things bug me because they are easy to get right. Emmett/Kellan looked like he showed up at the wrong set and meant to play Spock.     Taylor shines as usual. Loved Jasper's story and Jackson's chemistry with Ashley Greene (Alice). I wish we got more of Rosalie's history. It's one of the more interesting parts of the book, IMO. Although playing adversaries, Taylor and Rob have wonderful chemistry. Unfortunately, the only person Kristen seems to have chemistry with is Taylor. She acts apathetic during the make-out scene on the bed and during the proposal, but that's normal for her. I watched the first Twilight with an open mind, but I now can predict how she plays pretty much any role: gape, deep intake of air, run hands through hair, stutter, blink, repeat. She did the same thing in Into The Wild and Adventureland. (Sorry, I think she's over rated.) Since she's the main character, she should mostly carry the film, but she drags it down. I also think that Melissa Rosenberg must have been cheap because I can think of no other reason they keep her after all this time. I know movies are rarely as good as the book, but MelRose skewers the script.
B00004VEPS|5.0|I have to confess relative ignorance of Fricsay until somewhat recently. While he is one of the lesser known figures from the period typically recognized as the golden age of conductors--never achieving the status of say, a Furtwangler or a Klemperer--this neglect is more due to the brevity of his career than any comparative assessments. Rest assured, Fricsay's reading of the Dvorak no. 9 is weighty and substantial without being plodding or dense. He maintains precise control, never sacrificing urgency in the process. You will likely have other readings of this work. That said, this is one exhilarating New World from the Old World.
B004132HZS|5.0|What a fantastic update on the Sherlock Holmes story!  I generally do not like modern adaptations of older stories.  I also have always considered Sherlock Holmes and Dr. Watson to be products of their times- very Victorian in outlook and very British colonial in their approaches to life.  I also never thought Sherlock would do well in the modern world of criminology.    How wrong I was!  This adaptation brings both Holmes and Watson brilliantly to life, in our times.  Holmes uses text messages, scours the internet, and knows his way around a lab.  But he's still the same Sherlock- he has an addiction to nicotine patches, has very few social skills, makes very cutting remarks, and doesn't think there are many people in the world as smart as he is.  I have never before heard of the actor who plays Holmes, but he plays him so, so well.  He's complex and ambiguous and fantastic.  And the rest of the casting is pretty spectacular as well.    As to the stories, there are three presented in this mini-series, all of which have been updated just enough to give Holmes work to do.  He still rushes from the train to cabs, still knows every inch of London, still has his gang of informers in the underworld.  It's just... all taking place in 2010.    Highly recommended for Holmes fans of all stripes, and for anyone who enjoys witty repartee, compelling storylines and quality acting.
0062515608|5.0|The author, through a superficial story, describes the steps to perfect your body, brain and soul. The author understands human frailties and recognizes that the strategies he proposes will not be adhered to immediately but teaches the reader how to learn new good habits so that a happier, more productive and healthier life becomes inevitable. This book should  be read through  and then re-read one chapter at a time and practiced.
B003VS0CX8|1.0|i have 3 sound of music dvds and i purchased a new blue ray dvd i think they did a terrible job not much different than the old ones the only difference is the faces are sharper but the scenery and the beautiful mountains and back ground is no different than a vhs or the old dvd its sad such a great movie and they could t do any better
B003HYSSZK|5.0|This is a whole different look at the Doctor.<br />  >>>>SPOILER ALERT!!!&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;&lt;<br />Does he have feelings for his companions?  What does he really want from his life?  How do his enemies see him?  These questions, and more, are answered in this season of Doctor Who.  You want romance?  Long-term plans?  Do you want to know what goes on in that head of his?  You'll know all this and more after viewing this season.<br /><br />David Tennant, Matt Smith are terrific as the Doctor.  You'll meet Captain Jack, con artist.  Rose's fate isn't what you expected when she was sucked into another universe.....wait'll you see the twist that allows dreams to come true.  Rain Song is back, secrets revealed, the Universe gets a reboot, and the Doctor is shown through the eyes of his worst enemies to be the dangerous man that he is.  It can be a bit confusing because the timeline is all over the place.  (A great reason to buy the Season!)  Impossibilities are no problem, romance becomes an option, and more.  I've watched the  show since the 1970s, and this is my favorite season so far!<br /><br />Satisfaction....twists.....surprises.......you'll love it or hate it.  There's very little middle ground.  Amy Pond becomes tedious after a while, with the anger simmering below her surface and her tendency to treat people like minions......her chronic impatience.......and her inability to shut up, though she tells everyone else to shut up all the time!<br /><br />I loved nearly every episode, except the one with all the farting fat people who turn out to be aliens who look just like pigs, and the kid in a gas mask who constantly cries \\"Mommmmyyyyyy....\\"  However, many questions are answered satisfactorily (IMO), and Amy Pond is't overly annoying.  (I wanted to club her, but you might find her spunky.  (I found her disagreeable and bratty, but she's necessary to the story.  Oh, well.
B004BC7MRM|1.0|agreed..... i understand that artists want to move onto  other things, but in my opinion, its not as great as what made them famous in the first place.  let me say that first of all, im a big hip-hop and rap guy... but i'll also listen to really anything ( hip-hop, rap, rock, classical at times, alternative, even country... i even watch GAC at times when i bored.. why? b/c i like music in general.. if it sounds good.. i will listen)  I just think that this album, and any country work he does is OK. its not great. i personally think artists need to stick to what made them famous and great ( its called. 'niche').  sure, you can grow and let your music grow and change, but dont EVER forget what made you hot in the first place.  i havent bought a kid rock cd since Devil.. and i probably never will if he puts out stuff like this...
1400049628|2.0|The seller/item itself are great. The book itself is boring, highly contradictory and all together not deserving of reviews and media attention I've seen it receive. Sorry Max, you fail; first to die in a Zombie Outbreak for sure.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|My first Springsteen show was in Houston on the E Street Shuffle tour. I saw a show on every tour through Born in the USA after that. By far, my favorite tour was the Darkness tour in '78. I saw the San Antonio and Austin shows and the one from Houston captures The Boss the way I remember him then - happy, energetic, sincere and animated. Stunning, really. This set is worth that DVD alone.     On top of that, everything else is a bonus - and what a bonus! Darkness remastered is superior to previous versions, the documentary is fascinating, The Promise is the great lost Bruce record and a welcome respite from the weight and seriousness of his current work. I was highly intrigued by the live video of the Darkness album. The tone was as somber as the thematic material of the album and reflects the 32 years of maturity the band has experienced since the initial release. I enjoyed it, but I prefer the younger, lighter Bruce from the Houston show. The packaging is second to none - a Springsteen fan's dream.     In summary, buy this, ask someone to buy it for you or borrow a friend's - you HAVE to experience it.
B001GQSY5K|4.0|I thought maybe because this story was created & approved by George Lucas that it would maintain the same quality and character as, say, the Motion Picture Films.  Well, I was wrong.  It is obviously geared towards a younger crowd, and I thought the story was very weak.<br /><br />It's ok that this movie is targeting 10-14 yr olds, I don't have a real problem with that.  But I was expecting it to contain loads of back-story and a nice filler between Episodes II and III, primarily focusing on the Clone Wars on a large scale.  It did not deliver in this regard.  Instead, some stupid alien padawan-learner girl was the main focal point, and she was not entertaining.<br /><br />She did, however, hold her lightsaber backwards (like the dude from The Force Unleashed game) which I thought was pretty bad-ass.  And the dude that did the Obi-wan voice for this movie did a good job.  He sounded like Ewan McGregor which helped ease the pain of the corny dialogue and childish references.  Graphics were good too.<br /><br />But everything else sucked, and I am an UBER Star Wars fan.  So please don't get your hopes up.  Sorry.<br /><br />Mike
B00428ZRFY|4.0|I am a HUGE fan of Rihanna, and expected so much from this album, and although it is not a flop, I did set my hopes too high. In my opinion, \\"Rated R\\" was and is her best album to me. I can listen to every song on that album. But \\"LOUD\\", that is another story. There are probably, out of 11 tracks, 5 that I will listen to more than once. Rihanna, you know I love ya, and will always be a true fan. But I must admit, this album could have been a lot better, but what can you expect when it took less than a year to compile this. But the songs that I like, are solid. Good attempt!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|If you're a Bruce fan, you've been waiting for this release for a long time.  The Born to Run remaster was well done, but this is just off the charts.  His BEST album is now remastered and represented in a way I don't think any other album will be treated.  The spiral notebook gives you a peak into his creativity.  The sound is just amazing.  The DVD's are incredible.  The whole package is beyond anything we could have imagined as fans.

B000YKE87W|1.0|How these people claim to \\"love\\" Kaufmann is beyond me unless they have no taste or musicality, just parrotting what others write. He doesn't sing, he either belts it out (a true \\"can belto\\") with no taste, style, or musicality or he croons to beat Vickers. There is no individuality or color to the voice nor sensitivity. If you want to hear a REAL tenor, get these arias sung by Mario del Monaco or Carlo Bergonzi. Don't waste your money here.

B003XKPPOU|5.0|It's come to a pretty awful pass with regard to Hollywood movies these days, when the most sharply humorous, creative and character-driven escapade is an animated feature about children's toys  . . .  and the latest (and most probably final chapter) of three. Disney-Pixar just owns the family-friendly movie franchise by sheer force of creativity. (Well, and that practically every other studio of note seems to have abandoned the family movie-watching demographic anyway. Even if they hadn't, Disney-Pixar would still stand head and shoulders above the competition.)<br /><br />If Toy Story One explored sibling rivalry and Two wove a story of family loyalties - Three explores the bittersweet question of what happens when a child grows up and puts away childish things. What happens then, to those loyal toys of long standing when their owner Andy heads off to college? Is a box in the attic the best that can be hoped for - or as one character observes, \\"Let's see what we're going for on E-Bay.\\" Through the machinations of the plot, all the toys but Woody - Buzz, the Potatoheads, Jessie, Ham, Barbie and the rest - wind up being donated to a day-care center. What could be a better situation, they all think happily; to be played with constantly by children? They make new friends among the toys there; the cuddly purple stuffed bear, Lotso, for one, and Barbie - who knew she was a strict Constitutionalist? - meets Ken, whom we always suspected was just an accessory. And Buzz Lightyear reveals his inner Lothario, too.  But all is not well inside the walls of the day-care center, and suffice to say that the cuddly purple bear is not at all genial - or well-disposed to Andy's old toys. (It must be a specialty of the Disney-Pixar house to have initially bluff, hearty, friendly characters metamorphose into menacing and manipulative ones.) It becomes imperative that the toys escape, and thereby hangs the rest of the exciting and ultimately poignant story.

142311339X|4.0|I read the Percy Jackson series because my nephew was reading them, and I got hooked! I thought they were fun and imaginative, lighthearted and well written. I know lots of people loved Harry Potter, but I never did because I thought they were too dark and pessimistic. The Percy Jackson series was less scary, more hopeful, and more fun to read, and I think, more suitable for young readers.     I was excited when Rick Riordan came out with a new book, but I was also skeptical because he had already wrapped up the whole story and the loose ends in \\"The Last Olympian\\". I was a little afraid that he was trying to spin out the franchise and would run out of good ideas, churning out more of the same. Instead, Riordan creates three new appealing characters, and puts a really unexpected spin on the whole Olympian world that caught me by surprise! I won't say more here because it would spoil the book, but I was suitably impressed that Riordan had the imagination to come up with such a cool idea. It gave me a new world to discover, instead of rehashing the same old. Good job Rick Riordan!    This time around, the characters are older (15-16 years old) and there is a sweet little romance going on between two of them; the original Percy Jackson books started with Percy being 12 years old, and there was no sappy stuff till almost the last book. I think young readers might like the original series better because Percy starts off closer to their age. I was also a little tired of the \\"The world is going to end!\\" theme. The original series started off with the lesser adventures of Percy Jackson and culminated with an apocalyptic war at the end--this book throws you right into yet another apocalyptic war. I was left wondering, \\"How many times does the world have to almost end?\\" Although I liked the new twist in the story, my husband did find the story lines repetitive and too similar to the original series. Younger readers may not be so picky.    I highly recommend this series to allreaders from young to adult. I'd read the entire series before reading \\"The Lost Hero\\" though, as it wouldn't make sense otherwise. I also think young readers would enjoy starting with the early Percy Jackson books first, as Percy is closer to their age.

0307463745|4.0|It's a quick read at only 260 pages and every 2nd/3rd page is a picture. That doesn't mean you don't get value for money. But it is a quick page turner. I got through it in a few days on the train.<br /><br />The authors give you guidance and some strategy on the approach of running a business as a starter (not a startup). It's based on experience with some references, but it is not a theoretical book.<br /><br />They deliberately defy all the stereotypical actions associated with startups, and for good reason. Drawing on their own successful experiences, they want you to actually give it a go.<br /><br />I would recommend it as a light read for people running as a Micro-ISV software business, and a how to avoid the classic mistakes. Alot of classic mistakes new starters will make. There is no single way to run the business nor get started. And this is what they explain.<br /><br />The authors cover all the major aspects of running a micro-ISV, from thinking about your product, to having meetings, making decisions, to getting more people. All of it is quite sensible and very practical. I wouldn't say it's revolutionary, but I found it re-assuring to read and then compare to the way I am doing things, basically helped motivate me to keep going.<br /><br />The only drawback is that it is a little too anecdotal and don't find that it's gonna turn me into the next Jeff Bezo's, it's more in the lines of operational advice. It's all about execution not trying to find a good idea.<br /><br />So, in summary, it's a good book to help overcome any mental roadblocks you may have created for yourself in the anxiety about whether to invest time and sweat in starting a small business. I recommend it as a buy.
B0038M2AZA|5.0|I'm very happy.    I highly recommend this film.    A fantastic story beautifully acted and executed.
B004BC7MRM|2.0|Rick Rubin always makes most musicians sound better than they did before. Maybe it's the material this time. With the exception of the Sheryl Crow duet, this sounds like the same song with different lyrics. It probably doesn't help that I never was a fan of Kid Rock. Maybe I was asking to much of Rubin too. Rubin producing gave me hope that Kid's music might have improved. What was it my mother said? You can't turn a sows ear into gathering no moss? Something like that. Maybe you will like this CD if you're a Kid Rock fan. Repetition isn't the way I want a CD to sound though.
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|This CD should surprise those who have been accustomed to the style of the last several cds,and I doubt this will disappoint.  It is lovely, with her lilting voice, equally capable with the sorrowful tunes and the peaceful ones.  These songs are quieter than those on Alhambra, and since her voice does not have to compete with the drums (hardly any drums in these songs at all) you can really enjoy the purity of her voice.  What a pleasure to sit back and listen to, and be jealous of;)<br /><br />The songs are traditional celtic pieces that Loreena has arranged and she accompanies 4 of them on harp.  I think this instrument displays her skill as a musician best and it is not drowned out by loud accoustics.<br /><br />One of the songs is a tune that she has on her Christmas CD.  Here she has used entirely new words, so it is no longer a \\"Christmas\\" song.  It is pretty - just surprising to have such a radically different story!<br /><br />She is joined by some of the best musicians and they contribute to making this an enjoyable CD - perfect for relaxing or even listening while you work.  Hugh Marsh is again on violin, and I love this man's skill.  It would be terrific to see a \\"Devil Went Down to Georgia\\" type competition with Itzhac Perlman, another favorite violinist of mine.  I don't suppose someone could arrange it?  And Caroline Lavelle makes the cello absolutely buttery smooth.<br /><br />Digressing a bit, I hope that Peter Jackson, now filming the Hobbit, will listen to this music and and realize that Loreena McKennitt is actually part Elvish, and give her a cameo appearance (with music) in the House of Elrond.  There is great music and story telling in that great hall, and Loreena should be a shoe-in.  While he is at it, he could get Benjamin Bagby, of Sequentia, with his ancient harp, and he could be a storyteller in the style of his \\"Beowulf\\" performance.  If he can speak ancient anglo saxon like that, the Elvin tongues should be nothing for him to learn, andit would be amazing to see the talents of McKennit and Bagby combined.<br /><br />Thank you, Loreena for another excellent cd.  Thank you for your contribution to making the world more beautiful!

0316017922|1.0|This product was in no-way as advertised. The book was in a overall poor condition. Several stains on the outside and broken corners of book. I recieved the book on the very last day of shipment terms. Basically the company quarantined my financial deposit for a period of 15 plus days without any communication of the item being shipped. All one could do is sit and wait for the mail to show up. Poor communication during shipping process. Very poor business practices. Not recommended.
B004BC7MRM|4.0|I've been a fan of Bob since his harder-edged days in \\"The History of Rock\\", but his last several albums have been more classic rock than hip hop.  It's a change that I have grown to love.  And call me crazy, but the title track and the Sheryl Crow duet on this album are some of his best work to date.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|The alarm has been sent out in Grobania for his fans to come here and boost the rating of this CD so I thought I'd add my review as well. Thank you snow white for pointing me here.  If these same songs had been sprinkled in small doses within other more traditional Josh Groban songs sung in traditional rich baritone as he did on Closer and even to the degree of Awake they would go down easier but a whole CD of them. UGH.   Josh Groban is a fantastic singer!!! Stripped down or Fosterized (which can also get tiresome) makes no difference. Josh Groban's taste in writing, however,  is too outside my taste in listening. I think he did capture in his lyrics the angst of looking for love but the musical presentations of those lyrics is all over he place and very lacking in melodious flow. I think I might like the CD, even if it is full of \\"diary confessional\\" songs, if the presentations was better. Unlike others, knowing his heart is not a thrill for me. I'm looking to buy music that I, the consumer, enjoy. I have loved his acoustic covers of other people's writing (America, Arms of an Angel, Play Me - check for this on youtube) because the melodies were good so my not liking this CD is not because I am pining for the bombastic as some insist? No. I'm pining for well written and well delivered songs.  Am I looking for his rich baritone?  You betcha!  Enough with the falsetto! Others can do falsetto but only Josh Groban can deliver the warm, rich, hot fudge baritone that made him the star that he now is. I think Josh Groban strayed and STAYED too far out of his lane on this one. Hopefully, next CD will be a better balance and he will include more songs in the style that made him stand out from the crowd in the first place.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|When I first listened to Josh's new CD, I sorta went \\"huh\\"?  It had such a different quality electronically; it is not as \\"slick\\" or produced a sound as I have become used to hearing.  It is much more live and honest quality, which I think is what Josh and Rick Rubin were shooting for.    I find the opening instrumental \\"Wandering Kind\\" fun!  Not grand, just plain fun!    Songs that have become my favorites: the classical sound of L'ora Dell'Addio, the driving beat of Voce Existe Em Mim with the superb drum corp, the patriotic homage in War At Home (this one makes me tear up) and Hidden Away (although I've heard the radio mix and like it a bit better.  I like Higher Window a lot and enjoy the folksy feel to If I Walk Away.  Since I have done a lot of choral singing in Latin, I appreciate London Hymn for what it is, but it's not really my very favorites.  I think the jury is still out with me on Galileo (although the lyrics are intriguing) and the cover of Straight To You.    Just like most of his albums, there are those songs that grab you immediately and some that grow on you after further listening and studying.  Maybe this album requires more study that his earlier ones.  But I truly like this album and appreciate the direction to which Josh detoured.  How boring would it be if all of his songs sounded like Your Raise Me Up?    Thanks for the new work, Josh!
B002ZG974M|5.0|I don't normally watch documentaries, but this was one that I looked forward to for months. It was entertaining, adorable, and, at times, shocking. The differences in raising a child are astounding. All the kids are beautiful and I was able to form my own opinion without having a voice-over give me ideas on what I should be feeling. If it didn't have the nursing babies, I would show this to my class immediately.
0812550706|5.0|I don't know why I didn't discover and read this book earlier in my life. I've been an avid reader since I learned how to read and have devoured quite a few novels. I recall hearing mention of this series a handful of times in the past couple years, and finally a couple of weeks ago I decided to give it a shot. WOW! I was hooked in rather quickly and really touched by Ender's story. It soon became one of those I-can't-put-it-down type of books that left me pondering the ideas and themes whenever I wasn't reading and craving more as soon as I finished it. The primary reason I decided to read this in the first place was that many people whose book opinions I respect highly recommended and praised it, and now I know why. I really enjoyed the writer's style and feel that he did a wonderful job of leading the reader to care deeply for Ender and have some serious thoughts about the crazy things that go on in his futuristic world. The ending definitely left me wanting more, and I just recently finished the sequel Speaker for the Dead (which is quite different, but also awesome, check it out). I look forward to reading all the other Ender-related books out there (am currently reading First Meetings in the Enderverse (related short stories) while I wait to get my hands on Xenocide (book 3). If you like science fiction - or even if you don't, but you like books that are thrilling and really make you think about the deeper things that are going on beyond the actual action in the story - you will love Ender's Game.
031603438X|5.0|Great book . At times you felt like you were reading a combination of Angela's Ashes and Fear and Loathing.   It's written as if he is sitting there verbally reading the book to you . A bit stream of thought perhaps. It's interesting prose, though I was lost at times w/ some of the Brit slang.  It's pretty raw, you get the feeling that he held nothing back, and told it as he remembered (or what others remembered - he frequently defers to witnesses to explain a story from their point of view).  At the same time, I got the feeling he held some sort of grudge w/ Mick. I think he spends too much time on Mick and harps on the same topic about how he got a big head in the 80's. I'm sure he did, but he was the lead singer of the greatest band ever, that kept it together for many years, without complaint, while Keith was on smack. I'm sure Mick could write a book and pick out all the pet peeves about Keith as well.   Overall - I really enjoyed it. You keep having to remind yourself how much great music he created. I highly recommend the book - it's an easy read - entertaining, insightful, and I even appreciated the recipes at the end and went out and bought a bottle of HP (must be a UK thing - tastes like steak sauce).
0812550757|5.0|I just skimmed a few of the other 5-star reviews here, and I pretty much agree with them all so there is not much else to say. I read Ender's Game a couple weeks ago and loved it, so I couldn't wait to get my hands on the next book in this series. As others have pointed out, it was a bit of a rough transition when I first started reading Speaker. It's quite unlike Ender's Game which in the beginning can be disappointing. But, as others have also said, once I got into it (within the first couple of chapters), I became more and more interested and engrossed in the story and the characters and couldn't put it down. The themes of this story are deep and very thought-provoking. I'm glad in a way that I didn't get into this series until now (I'm 32) even though it's found in the \\"teen\\" section at my local library. I'm sure I got a lot more out of it now that I'm older and more mature and can grasp some of the deeper issues that this book tackles. I became attached to all the characters (which is saying something, because at first I was a bit overwhelmed at the sheer number of new characters we are introduced to) and I am very eager to read the remaining books in this series. OSC is obviously a truly great and talented writer and I plan to read every Ender-related book there is and then also perhaps check out some of his other works.

0670020478|2.0|I'm a raving Kindle fanatic, so when I read the sample on my Kindle, I bought this book at once.  I expected the frieght train, which had just left the station by the end of the sample, to really keep rolling.  But after a few more chapters, not only did it lose steam, it got completely derailed!  This book could have been a work of genius if a) the author hadn't pushed so desperately hard to fill up his (contractual obligation of) 60,000+ words that he was soon grasping at thin air to stuff in any old thing and b) if he'd stuck to what he's good at and not tried to write the general compendium on the topic.<br /><br />I've rarely been so let down by a book for which I had such initial passion.  I read literally hundreds of books before, during and after publication every year. (I'm a literary agent).  I hoped for so much from this book, but I did not find the content met the promises offered in the first chapter.  He gets too buried in pet theories and academic tangents, and loses his content's focus repeatedly.  I'm guessing this writer Aronica, whose work is typically strong, did the best he could, but this was just a weak execution of a brilliant concept. I couldn't even finish it - chose to delete it from my Kindle.<br /><br />I hardly ever write a negative review of a published book, but then again, I'm rarely this disappointed.
B0040T7B2W|4.0|I was recently discussing with one of my friends about this album, and apparently everyone she knows thinks it's terrible, and she didn't like it either. But I really disagree... I actually really really like it. I actually like it better than \\"The Life Pursuit\\" (which my friend could NOT believe). I think we expect too much from them. I don't think there can be another \\"If You're Feeling Sinister\\" because it was just THAT amazing. That was a once in a lifetime kind of good that most bands can only hope to achieve once, if at all. It's just unreasonable to expect more than that. Anyway, I don't think this album was bad by any means. Upon first listen, I had my doubts, but it really improves with time, like most good albums. I was really skeptical about the Norah Jones collaboration, but it's absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the high points of the album. My favorite song here is \\"Come On Sister\\". I like that they're going for a faster pace here, but it's still undeniably their signature sound. I also LOVE the synths. I think it's a perfect compliment to the music, but it really adds something, instead of just being arbitrary. One of my other favorites is \\"I Can See Your Future\\". I love the horn and string arrangements. I wish they would have ended with this song instead of \\"Sunday's Pretty Icons\\". I'm never really crazy about Stevie's songs, but \\"I'm Not Living in the Real World\\" isn't too bad. It's really a pretty solid album. I already love singing along to it.
B002R0F3Q2|4.0|Alicia has done it again. She has come up with another good CD. She's not putting out random stuff like certain artists these days are. This is good music. Yes, as you can tell from the different intro to this CD from her other CD's, this is different. There's no piano intro but a voice over from Alicia Keys talking about the Element Of Freedom. The CD begins with \\"Love Is Blind\\", a song that sounds inspired by Kanye West's 808s & Heartbreak days. It has a wonderful groove to it. You then have the lush \\"Doesn't Mean Anything\\", which is a very good track, but not her best. Then you get into the amazing \\"Try Sleeping With A Broken Heart\\", with it's thumping bass beat behind it and Alicia's voice oozing sensuality on top of it. It's sooo good.     The next song, \\"Wait til you see my smile\\" is an album standout, along with \\"That's how Strong my love is\\" and \\"Un-thinkable (I'm Ready). These 3 songs are tops on the album. The first two show Alicia's new direction musically. No, it's not straight R&B like her 1st CD, but it's surely there just with a new pop overtone. For those that aren't used to that, give it a chance. You may like it. \\"Un-thinkable\\" has to be the album standout. With lyrics and background vocals by rapper Drake, this song is just tooooo sexy. Her voice is gorgeous on this. The beat is low keep and lush and puts you into a smooth mood. I love that song too much LOL.     The album isn't perfect, though. The next two songs are an example of it. \\"Love is my Disease\\" and \\"Like the Sea\\" are OK, nothing more. Alicia is also showing her artistic growth on these songs, but they just aren't her best. Her up-tempo club banger with Beyonce, \\"Put it in a Love Song\\" is a catchy tune with a nice beat to it, but honestly, with those two big name, talented divas, it's just an OK effort. I still love me some Alicia and Beyonce though! The album then gets back to the hits with \\"This Bed\\" where Alicia pays some tribute to Prince. It sounds like a Prince song with it's uptempo funky beat. Good track. The album ends with some good songs, nice and positive. \\"Distance and Time\\", \\"How It Feels To Fly\\" and \\"Empire State Of Mind (Part II)\\" are all nice and smooth. Listen to her words on these songs. Piano is there. The positivty is there. They are all good ways to end the album. Overall, this album isn't her best but it is the best in overall flow. Good CD and a must have for Alicia Keys fans. Also a good place for non-fans to start. Go and get it!!!!!
B003UBTX7C|1.0|I bought the Kindle DX to save money and space in the long run.  But this pricing will force me to just put the hardcover version in my wish list.

0143144766|5.0|Listening to Ron McLarty read Pynchon's \\"Inherent Vice\\" may be an even richer experience than reading it.

B0043GAZYS|5.0|I hadn't been this excited for a home release since the extended Lord of the Rings releases.<br /><br />This is a love story for the kids who grew up with video games, flashing lights and short attention spans. The 80's and 90's never died, they just crept away into Bryan Lee O'Malley's head. Great acting, great special effects (that don't detract from the experience), great music. Michael Cera brings it down to 10/10 when it could have been an 11.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|Being a Kid Rock fan since way back when, I was already prepared and pre-warned that what was going to be on this album was not the hip-hop or metal stuff, but a more classic feel. Now, after hearing the album, I can say I'm not overly disappointed, but I feel there was a little too much focus on production rather then making a hit song. Kid Rock stated he wanted to make more songs like \\"Picture\\" & \\"Only God Knows Why\\" but I honestly don't think anything on this album comes close to being as memorable. I'm not saying the album is bad at all, it's just I think Rick Rubin may have focused on the wrong aspects of the production of this album rather then what really mattered. I first heard Rick Rubin's work back in 1995 when he produced AC/DC's \\"Ballbreaker\\" album, and despite what others may have to say about it, I think he did a great job of it. On this album, I'm not sure why Rubin wanted to replace Kid Rock's band \\"The Twisted Brown Truckers\\" with other musicians. As someone has already stated in their review too, \\"why? There is nothing special about the musical aspect of this album\\" which I couldn't agree more with. Tho I could hear a difference between how what the TBT and this band would have done it, it's not that noticeable a difference, and i'm sure Rick Rubin could have gotten the exact same sound out of them.    \\"Born Free\\" is a decent track, starting off sounding country then progressing into somewhere between classic rock and southern blues with a pop element mixed into it.     \\"Slow My Roll\\" sounds a bit like a Creedence Clearwater Revival song, then rolling into a ZZ-Top goes countryish. Not bad, but could easily be forgettable.    \\"Care\\" - This track I felt didn't belong on the album, the whole hip-hop/rap lyric thing mixed into a country song just didn't work here, at least not in my opinion. I thought i'd heard this song before, and sounded kinda cheap.    \\"Purple Sky\\" - Kicks off with a country/blues upbeat, then rolls into something that reminds meof \\"All Summer Long\\" re-written into this tune. It's a decent track tho.    \\"When It Rains\\", starts off a little slow, but is one of the best tracks of this album to me. I guess we'd all like to forget what we have learned and live back when we didn't know what we know now, so anyone can relate to this song.    \\"God Bless Saturday\\" - Kicking off with a low dirty southern guitar riff, then into something that reminds me of \\"Takin' Care of Business\\" with more Creedence Clearwater Revival lyrics over it. Not a bad song either.    \\"Collide\\" - I know a lot of you love Sheryl Crow, and even Bob Seger, but I do not know what is so special about this song? I think too many people are aware of Sheryl & Kid doing \\"Picture\\" so they have skipped to this song for that reason, but I still say, it's no \\"Picture\\", it doesn't come close.    \\"Flyin' High\\" - Kid Rock stated that this album would not be him screaming out his own name anymore, but quite frankly, I am pretty sick of hearing about his love of Detroit now. It almost seems to be a bit of a rehash of the song he and Uncle Kracker did called \\"Heaven\\" which was a lot better.    \\"Times Like These\\" - easily forgettable.    \\"Rock On\\" - At first I wondered if this was a cover of the classic song of the same title, but it's not. at this point i was also tired of hearing the \\"1,2,3\\" intro. I couldn't help but feel this slow, almost balled was just the same song I had been hearing all through this album. Kid wrote on his last album \\"It's the same old song spinnin' but the same songs always the same\\" which is evident here. Again, easily forgettable.    \\"Rock Bottom Blues\\" - It's still a low down country sound, but with the harmonicas and more upbeat drums, things begin to pick up again. Some parts of this song remind me of previous Kid Rock songs he has done, in particular \\"Rock N Roll Paintrain\\" but it's still one of the better numbers on this album.    \\"For the First Time In a Long Time\\" - Ok, by now, we get it, OK? Kid Rock's clouds have lifted and he enjoys life. However, this doesn't even sound like Kid Rock. Singing in a rather high key, if someone played this to you, and you had no idea who it was, you probably would not guess it's Kid. But then when the backing vocals of the chorus kick in, you'd probably think it does. It's not a bad song, but not one i'd say is a favorite.    Overall; I just don't hear the stand out tracks, if this was meant to be more \\"Picture\\", \\"Only God Knows Why\\", \\"Blues Jeans & A Rosery\\" then I'm afraid I just did not hear anything on this album that matched up against those classics. There is some decent stuff to be heard here, but I think all the hype I was hearing about this album has just left me feeling a little let down. It's a much better album then a lot of artists 2010 releases i've heard, but I don't think you will find that smash hit by Kid Rock emerge from this album, or hear that this is another Grammy/CMA award winning album.
B003UYUR0G|1.0|I so want the time back I wasted watching this drivel! Granted, I am not a huge fan of video games, and the fantasy genre in movies is the equivalent to nails on chalkboard for me (hubby picked this movie), but movie was simply bad, bad, bad! I understand it's Disney, so therefore it's whitewashed. But the \\"hero\\" in the movie jumps higher, runs faster, fights better, in fact has no faults whatsoever, and that is just annoying to me. I so wanted him to die a thousand terrible deaths.    And the \\"princess?\\" Another major annoyance. One thing I absolutely hate - both in movies and novels - is when a character portrays some one from the modern day in a period piece. It's fake and artificial. This \\"princess\\" was some one from 2010 and put into an ancient Persian setting. It just made me want to scratch my eyeballs out.     I suppose young, immature, pre-pubescent males will appreciate this, this...whatever one might want to call it. After all, it's the only audience I can think it might even be remotely intended for.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I received this CD to review for OnetoOne Network and I have to say I did not enjoy it as much as her first CD.  She has a beautiful soulful voice and that certainly comes through on these recordings but the song choices and collaborations just sounded all wrong.  I am still a big fan though!
B003L20ICE|5.0|Hollywood has been all a buzz with \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" a new film out by director Lisa Cholodenko. This is the first major Hollywood film about a fairly common family, with one exception. The parents are both women.      \\"The Kids Are All Right,\\" stars female heavyweight actors Julianne Moore and Annette Bening as lesbian parents of two children whom have come to be curious about their natural father (only known as a sperm donor). The insertion of this character, played by Mark Ruffalo, causes the balance of the family to go askew, and perhaps damages it beyond repair.      But the story line is not what has all the movie reviewers worked up and excited. The performances so artfully crafted by Julianne Moore and Annette Bening are ones that will be studied by students of the craft. Lisa Cholodenko takes the characters and delicately peels away the layers of suburban convention and eco-pretentiousness to reveal the broken-hearted awareness of passion missing from a relationship. Moore and Bening are at their best, portraying long-loved partners that time, rearing children and careers have drained them of the love that once brought them together.      Bening especially shines as a woman with heavy responsibilities and fears that her manicured family unit may be changed forever. In one scene Bening sings the words from Joni Mitchell's \\"Blue\\" and we see a middle-aged woman with a heart exposed and for just a moment completely relinquishing the walls the protected her so well before.      Julianne Moore's performance is one more subtle and quiet. Yet, within this character that always put others before her own desires, it's apparent that a yearning to be seen and heard may break her away from a life that has been comfortable and easy.      The children played by Mia Wasikowska and Josh Hutcherson are well casted and the supporting role by beautiful Yaya DaCosta adds necessary zest to the story.      Obviously this film is not going to please many due to the lesbianstory line, but in the end it is a film more about families and love than it is about sexual orientation. See this film when you get the chance to, it's a promise that it will be in the mix around award season and you will want to know for yourself that \\"The Kids Are All Right.\\"    \\"The Kids Are All Right\\" is rated R for sexually explicit scenes and has a run time of 1 hr. and 46 minutes    For more film reviews and news from Kay Shackleton see: [...]    Kay Shackleton is a film historian with special focus on Silent Films, you can see her work at: [...]
B004222UCS|4.0|Seventh Star is an excellent 80's style Tony Iommi solo metal album. Calling it Black Sabbath backfired as a sales incentive, angering many Black Sabbath fans who would have been more open minded to the records different styles if it had been labeled ONLY as a Tony Iommi solo project. And it would still be long forgotten without the excellent soulful vocals of Glenn Hughes, \\"The Voice Of Rock\\". He makes the average songs good, and the good ones incredible! Heart Like A Wheel, Danger Zone, Angry Heart and In Memory are standout tracks because they DON\\"T sound like Black Sabbath. A unique record in the 'Sabbath timeline.  It's the bonus live tracks that dissapointed me so badly. Glenn was sick/in a fight and got his nose broken/having drug issues (or all of the above) just before the Seventh Star tour, and was in no shape vocally to perform. Glenn stuck it out anyway and sang on March 21, 1986 in Cleveland. It was rough in parts, but the show went over well. After that, Glen fell apart more each performance, and was replaced by Ray Gillen within days.  The live bonus tracks feature Ray instead of Glenn on vocals, and that's where things go wrong. Whether you're a Ray Gillen fan or not,these live versions are nothing like the Seventh Star studio tracks! The first (and best) live show that Glenn Hughes performed with Black Sabbath (Cleveland 3/21/86) should have been remastered and added as the bonus tracks... they are the only ones that compliment the Seventh Star release and would have truly let you hear and judge this unique \\"Black Sabbath\\" lineup live before it's brief time was up.
0316098337|1.0|I read this book half way through and couldn't take it anymore.  Trying to read and understand the supposed five year old language (more like a three year old) plus get past the depressing tone was way too much.  Also, the fact that the five year old was always asking to be breast fed over and over got really sickening.  There are too many good reads to waste your time on this one.
B003XWEQ1G|5.0|Received item just as stated in product discription. Item came in a timely manner.    The movie is a great gift for your gentlemen friends or loved ones.  Great man movie!!  I have not uploaded the version for my Ipod as of yet, but looking forward to getting that completed.  Being able to watch in many different ways is the reason that I bought this version.
B0028R3NCU|4.0|I have had no significant problems with this.  The paint wore off, so no it is silver, but it still works great.  The only issue is that if someone else uses it, they usually stick it into the USB port upside down, and wonder why it isn't showing up.  My old phone used micro sd cards, so I kept this attached to it, but I'm on to a new phone now, and this is USB adapter is on my key ring.

B003ZK58WM|2.0|After reading all of Mr. Follett's books I was looking forward to Fall of Giants.  I really tried to like it but got a bit tired of all the history.  The characters were interesting and promising but there's no opportunity to get to really know them.  Everytime I'd get engrossed in an event in a character's life the book would switch back to what was going on with the war - happened too often.  If you're a fan of WWII history you'll probably find this book fascinating but if you're looking for a good book along the lines of Pillars or World you might be disappointed.  All in all, not really worth the Kindle price.
B0040JHXT8|5.0|I got the vinyl pressing of The Promise today.     It is dead quiet and absolutely flat. Very good sound quality - not great sonics, won't become your system test or show off record, but very good. And that is absolutely wonderful considering the track record for Springsteen on vinyl. It's a joy for me to be able to say that this sounds good.    And in terms of the music, no one (not even D.J.!) will be surprised at it's greatness. This is from the same well as Darkness. It isn't more Darkness, but its from the same waters.      There are a lot of great new 2010 albums, some even brilliant; but this is in a league of its own.     No one has done it before. Releasing a 21 song album that matches the most legendary work of their career and is literally from the era of that work. For me it's as incredible as if the Beatles had released more from the Abbey Road sessions, Dylan more Highway 61 or Bringin it All Back Home period recordings, Miles more of Kind of Blue. (Or even more Alvin and the Chipmunks \\"Chipmunk Punk)! This is the stuff of my dreams.    Yup, I said it matches. By that I did not intend to imply that it was more of the same...that it was \\"Darkness Part Two\\".  These songs and others were left off Darkness because Springsteen was aiming to create exactly what he released... the material was not left off on the whole because he felt it was of \\"lessor\\" quality, but because it did not fit the work he was aiming to create. In fact other members of the band balked at his dropping many of these songs because they felt they were just as good. Springsteen has never said that they weren't as good, only that they did not belong on \\"Darkness on the Edge of Town\\".      That does not mean that they are as powerful, or as dark, or even as poignant, although some of them are. It means that the musicians who played them felt they were also great Bruce Springsteen songs. As do I. If you don't hear them as such because they are not more Darkness On the Edge of Town per se,then you are missing on some great Springsteen music circa 1977. You are missing some of the REST of what he was thinking/creating at the time. I maintain my opinion that this is as exciting as the Beatles releasing more from the Abbey Road sessions would be.     The Promise is my unequivocal pick as vinyl release of the decade.
B003IY47JK|5.0|COMING FROM A CLASSICAL MUSIC BACKGROUND, I HAVE TO SAY THAT THIS IS THE MOST PERFECT AND ORIGINAL MUSIC I HAVE HEARD FOR A LONG TIME. IF YOU LISTEN IT HAS ALL THE ELEMENTS OF CLASSICAL MUSIC, BEAUTIFUL HARMONIES, CORD CHANGES, AND THE MUSIC ENHANCES THE STORY BEHIND THE LYRICS. THERE ARE SONGS ON THIS ALBUM THAT BRINGS TEARS TO MY EYES WITH THE INTENSE EMOTION THEY DELIVER. THE \\"BEAUTY AND THE BEAST\\" CONTRAST OF THE \\"GROWLING\\" VOCALS VS THE ETHERAL VOICES IS SOMETIMES LOST ON OTHERS WITHOUT A BROAD MUSIC BACKGROUND. THANK YOU DELAIN, I EXPECT GREAT THINGS FROM YOU!
0307454541|2.0|I almost stopped reading this book after the first few graphic, sexually violent scenes. I thought they were completely disgusting and the amount of detail was unnecessary to advance the story. I stuck with the book, though, partly because it was the only book I'd taken on a long plane ride to California and partly because I always like to give books the benefit of the doubt.<br /><br />It took forever for the story to get started. There were a lot of secondary characters that got way too much attention. Most of the book lacked emotion. I know one of the main characters was emotionally devoid on purpose, but I never felt emotionally attached to any of the characters; I never felt any of their pain or worry, and there was a lot of both in the story.<br /><br />After the horrific climax, the story drags on too long again with a lot of detail and little action. I will admit that I did not have the whole story figured out in advance, though, and there were some discoveries that took me by surprise.<br /><br />I'm awfully worried to find out what the movie for this book would be like. The only scenes that weren't boring were the awful scenes that made me cringe and feel scared for every woman I've ever known.
0316069884|5.0|Fortunately Jonathan Safran Foer has the words. For the animals who suffer. For the dangerous secrets of factory farming and the cost of cheap meat. I knew before reading this book that I would be persuaded to have to sacrifice certain things (eating meat) with the acquisition of knowledge. But I am happy to make that scarifice which is relatively so small for such a considerable result. If you care at all about animal suffering, biodiversity, and human health, you will benefit from reading this provocative book that has finally quieted the gnawing cognitive dissonance that once used to haunt my thoughts on the matter.
B00428ZRFE|3.0|Rihanna is one of pop music's most recognizable figures.  Rihanna has released five albums in an incredibly short span of time where most artists take years between successive albums. Keeping up with her fast pace and desire to stay `relevant,'  Rihanna follows her moderately successful [[ASIN:B002UXRH10 Rated R]] with a tamer, less flashy effort [[ASIN:B00428ZRFE Loud]]. 'LOUD' is by no means a `bomb,' but nor is it the unrequited triumph of her best effort [[ASIN:B0018S6YO4 Good Girl Gone Bad: Reloaded]] or her rebellious, captivating 'Rated R.'  This album is more on par with efforts [[ASIN:B0009XFJ0O Music of the Sun]] (2005) or [[ASIN:B000EQ4G5K A Girl Like Me]] (2006);  those albums had notable hits, but were easily eclipsed by 'Good Girl Gone Bad' and 'Rated R.'  'LOUD' is not absent of hits - that would be an overstatement considering that the exceptional \\"Only Girl (In the World)\\" has ascended to the top of the pop charts much quicker than \\"Russian Roulette\\" or \\"Hard\\" could ever hope to.  That said, there is no \\"Rude Boy\\" or \\"Umbrella\\" to truly make this a well rounded, Rihanna effort; it is a mixed-bag.<br /><br />\\"S&M\\" opens the album strongly with its euro-pop driven production work.  While the trend is growing a bit old at this point (no offense to David Guetta), this cut works for Rihanna.  It is, less captivating than the incredible \\"Wait Your Turn\\" from Rated R.  That said, the songwriting is catchy and the production work solid.  The track is overt (\\"Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it/sex in the air, I don't care, I like the smell of it...\\"), if in a subtler way than say \\"Rude Boy.\\" \\"What's My Name\\" featuring ubiquitous rapper/singer Drake works well (it is now another #1 hit for Rihanna), though it does not dare eclipse Rihanna's finer material.  Drake's appearance is good here, but it doesn't stand out - maybe it is because his guest spot is at the beginning of the track and so brief.  The track grows the slightest bit repetitive given all the gimmicky and continuous production loop, but again it is not a bad listen.<br /><br />\\"Cheers Drink To That\\" is an oddity, finding Rihanna exploiting the lower range of her voice.  The vocal performance turns out to be somewhat monotone until the hook, where Rihanna sings: \\"cheers to the freak-n weekend, I drink to that...\\"  The most interesting moment may be the breakdown section, where the production is stripped and contrasts a rather repetitive cut.  \\"Fading\\" is a better cut, using piano within the production and making the dance-pop artist more vocally-viable here.  \\"Only Girl In the World\\" is the valedictory performance, placing the pop artist against an overt dance-friendly beat.  The songwriting stands out (Well as far as being catchy): \\"Want you to make me feel like I'm the only girl in the world, like I'm the only one that you'll ever love, like I'm the only one who knows your heart...\\"<br /><br />\\"California King Bed\\" is somewhat a miss and ill-fitting, but does provide a change of pace from typical Rihanna fare.  Here, Rihanna's bare vocals shine initially given the stripped production work.  Somewhat reminiscent of the fine \\"Firebomb\\" from Rated R,  the track fails in comparison to that cut and ends up being a bit `too manic' and `melodramatic.'  \\"Man Down\\" is even worse, finding Rihanna rehashing her tropical roots with this sub-par cut.  It might be a different affair if \\"Man Down\\" felt like top-notch, first-rate Rihanna, but it suffers from being a bore to listen to and frankly all over the place.  \\"Raining Men\\" featuring ubiquitous female rapper Nicki Minaj helps to redirect the falling momentum of the album with a more hip-hop driven cut that would have been perfectly at home on a Beyonc&eacute; effort.  It isn't perfect (and a bit busy), but it is superior to former cuts \\"California King Bed\\" and \\"Man Down.\\"<br /><br />\\"Complicated\\" features captivating production work, finding the track building up gradually.  \\"Skin\\" is the sole track that feels completely different from past Rihanna cuts, though it ends up lasting the slightest bit too long in duration.  That said, it is one of the better cuts at the `tail-end' of the album.  \\"Love the Way You Lie, Pt. II\\" featuring Eminem serves to the same effect as Alicia Keys' \\"Empire State of Mind (Broken Down)\\" from 'The Element of Freedom' - a path already tread by its parent artist.<br /><br />Essentially, many had guessed that 'LOUD' would be more of an `anachronism' than a forward-thinking effort from its muse.  I am not surprised given first two singles \\"Only Girl in the World\\" and \\"What's My Name\\" are tamer than recent singles and not nearly as innovative.  This is a `fans' album, not a crossover effort that will win new fans to the singer.  Maybe it will return fans who felt Rihanna's darker side (Rated R) was `too big' a step for the singer who mostly appealed to a tween audience.past Rihanna cuts, though it ends up lasting the slightest bit too long in duration.

B0042AEOG0|5.0|I really like listening to this CD straight through.  There's only one song that I don't care for and that's \\"Santa Claus Is Coming To Town\\".  It's too urban for my taste but all the others are quite enjoyable.  \\"Christmastime Is In The Air Again\\" is a beautiful song.  \\"Charlie Brown Christmas\\" is very nice.      I like that Mariah does some good old fashioned \\"belting\\" on this CD, something that's been missing from her latest music.  She turns it loose on \\"O Come All Ye Faithful\\".  I think that since she's quit drinking due to her pregnancy her voice has improved and it's evident on this CD.  Very nice follow up to her first CD.  You could play them back to back and they would flow together nicely.
B00275EHJG|4.0|This one is easily the best of the 3 Toy Story movies - I'm an adult, and I cried several times, and loved it.  It's a bit scary, though, if you have a sensitive kid, you may want to preview it before buying . . .
B002ZG99A4|1.0|They really didn't have to do much to make this movie entertaining, but they used Jet Li completely wrong.  It was awkward and made the movie painful to watch.  I recommend that you do not even be curious about this movie.  Just avoid it.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|Just like Kid Rock has always been, free from musical genre baricades. He's done Detroit Rock mixed with some Rap & Hip-Hop, Heavy Metal, Southern Rock, along with Country Music & Pure Motown Soul, and this album is a true testament of his \\"free-form\\", musical style. The musicians and instruments vary from song to song on this album, but you do get some great background vocals on most songs.    As some of the other reviewers have stated, this album reflects a more mature, Kid Rock. Plus, The Rolling Stone magazine review of this album (Nov.25,2010 #1118), states \\"it has the Skynyrd guitar attack, the Leon Russell-style gospel backup singers, and some fire down-below boogie from Detroit's Bob Seger\\". I agree with their assessment. However, what makes it different, is that the Kid is free from genre barriers, like those 70's songs, and it incorporates some Country, Soul, Blues, Rap, and also a little Gospel, along with the 70's style Rock.    The song \\"Born Free\\" is a statement of the Freedom he has found in life and in music. The song \\"Care\\", with \\"Country Queen\\", Martina McBride & \\"Atlanta Rapper\\" T.I., is a perfect example of how the \\"Kid\\", can mix genres, and make it work. \\"Care\\" sings about things that you can't do, but at least you can \\"Care\\" ...\\"it's what you can do...\\", so Raps T.I. Martina really pours her country soul into this one also. It's a fantastic song, and it even includes a bit of Gospel.     \\"Collide\\" contains a great duet with his singing partner Sheryl Crow, plus it has his Detroit hero, Bob Seger on piano. Kid & Sheryl had the big hit \\"Picture\\", from a few years back. They sing good together. \\"Collide\\" is a great song about taking chances (and being free). \\"Flyin' High\\" is a great \\"feel good\\" song, featuring Zac Brown, from Atlanta. Kid was on Zac's \\"Pass the Jar\\" CD/DVD. If you like Kid Rock, you would really enjoy his performance of some Southern Rock on \\"Pass the Jar\\". The rest of the songs are good solid \\"sing along\\" songs, reflecting the economic times we are in, such as \\"When It Rains\\", and \\"Times Like These\\". \\"Rock Bottom Blues\\" is a bluesy one, but it is also a statement, about how you can still have good times anyway...\\"it feels good to me...\\" sings Kid Rock. It contains some great harmonia music. It's suppose to have Trace Adkins singing background vocals, but I can't hear him. \\"For the First Time in a Long Time\\", it's kinda like a song of reflections on where the Kid's come from and the success he has achieved. \\"For the first time, in a long time\\", he's feeling good about himself.    The CD has a hidden 13th track, of a remix of \\"Care\\". It contains some very, very, Soulful vocals, and T.I. contributes some great Gospel, Soulful, Rap. It makes you want to \\"Care\\". Again, this is a terrific song, with mixed genres.    Overall, this is a good solid album, and I think it will go down in history as one of Kid's best. Thanks!!!
0553805371|3.0|Although I havent completed reading the book, it is in very straight forward, largely non-technical language so that those not versed in science and cosmology can understand it.  Because it is so simple language wise, I found it a bit dumbed down and didnt hold my interest as I had anticipated, but that may be a premature judgement.  I read 4 to 6 books a week in several fields and have done so for years, so it may be that they wrote the book to appeal to a general audience.  But something gets lost in translation in doing that.  I speculate as dont know for sure, but that is my best guess.  the subject matter is fascinating however, but.....as stated above.

B001U0HBPG|1.0|CGI, Computer Generated Imagery, has become the real Frankenstein Monster of the last decade or two. Not since the butchering of the original Star Wars Trilogy with a superfluous mob of cartoonish creatures has there been a more gratuitous waist of talent and resources.<br />  An ill-consieved story, tedious and unwatchable, the drippy sentimentality was supposed to mask the fact that there was no plot,ethics, nor any real reason to stay with it except to watch Brad's face change.<br />  What ever goofy Zen message was buried under all that glitsey prattle was obviously waisted on me. I don't think I am alone in my disdain, or the resale value of this Oscar winning New Age Classic would at least equal the cost of the postage it takes to order it.<br />  As with so many vacuous new multi-million dollar spectacles, every one was asking how they would do it, or what they would do. But no body ever seems to ask if they should do it at all. Kind of like setting off the first nuke.<br />  There was concern about whether or not they might just set fire to Earth's atmosphere and sterilize the whole ball. That would have ended WW2,I suppose. Nobody knew what a nuke would do. Now I am not saying that a Hollywood bomb is as bad as a nuke in your neighborhood. But a film like Ben Button is just about as welcome.<br />  Maybe it's me.<br />  'nuff said.
0525951652|5.0|Hi everyone!  I am amazed at the number of bad reviews.  I have read several of Ken Follett's books and found this one extremly entertaining.  At first I was a little intimidated by the size of the book (big enough to use as a door stop), but I found I could not put it down.    I especially enjoyed seeing what life was like in Russia pre revolution and how the movement there should not have been called Communism, but actually Bolshvickism due to them extreme ruthlessness that leaders of the latter movement employed.    Anyway, I loved the novel, and would highly recommend it, especially if you enjoy historical fiction.
B0006B29Z2|5.0|This will be a great addition to your Maiden collection. It is jam-packed with tons of material including both Di'Anno and Dickinson era footage. The Documentary is very entertaining, informative, and complete. This release could have easily been made into 4 or more separate dvd's. For the price you are getting a hell of a deal. This is definitely a must-have for any Iron Maiden fan.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I consider myself a huge Kid Rock fan.  I have his early albums, the ones before Devil Without a Cause, have seen him perfom three times, and generally revere the man.  With that established, I must say I am sorely dissapointed with this album.     Simply put, I miss the old Kid Rock.  Even at his most cocky, with arrogant, self-praising lyrics, I always felt Kid Rock was poking a little fun at himself.  Yes, he was brash, but you knew he did not take himself too seriously.  I always felt his songs were good at pointing out hypocrisy in a sly manner.    On this album, the lyrics are very simple, inane even.  The songs just say the same words over and over again, and I am sick of every song when it has about 30 seconds left.  I find myself skipping forward just to end the monotony.  Kid Rock's previous songs had clever lyrics that made me want to listen closely, and they often told a story.  The songs on this album all sound like a good time beer commercial.  I know Kid has his own brand of beer.  They will not have to look far for background songs for the commercials showing the people of different races and professions having a great time together.  The whole album is just too Brady Bunch, goody-two-shoes.    I miss the old Kid Rock that stuck it to the man, made me look at myself in a different light, and mostly made me laugh.
B003HFFVDQ|4.0|I first discovered the Chemical Brothers with \\"Exit Planet Dust.\\" I followed it up with \\"Dig Your Own Hole.\\" These albums had some really great stuff, but not all was well. A problem I have with Chemical Brothers CDs is that they tend to be uneven. Perhaps it's just me. I just love some of the songs and would rather skip over others. I suppose I should just collect the best of the songs from each of the CDs and then make a Chemical Brothers disc that satisfies my own personal tastes. The problem is, it then doesn't flow well as a well-thought-out CD should. In my opinion, the \\"Surrender\\" CD is the best the Brothers have turned out and I stopped being a serious listener at about that point or shortly thereafter. Well, now the \\"Further\\" CD is out and I just couldn't resist. It's a good CD and is well done. It has a nice collection of songs, but none stands out in my mind. I'm certain a lot of people think it's great stuff. I have no complaints. I think that my tastes have just drifted away from Chemical Brothers music and now lean more toward Matthew Dear, Daft Punk and Deadmau5. Adios, Brothers. I've really enjoyed your music over the last decade.<br /><br />Gary Peterson
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Needless to say it was perfection in every sense of the word. It was also simple and different than any Josh song I've heard yet. I mean, every song of his has its own uniqueness, but these are very...deep. Very personal. I was near tears listening to War At Home. I wonder what inspired Josh to write such a beautiful song. Who did he meet on that journey? I have to say my favorites are Bells of New York City, London Hymn and Straight To You. I keep listening to London Hymn and Straight To You on repeat.     By the way, I've never heard Josh do a song like London Hymn before. It gave me the chills - it was downright beautiful. Josh's voice and spirit are growing. Let's come along on this ride with him.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Long-time fan but this album is awful. I've never had a Kid Rock album put me to sleep...until now.  I can appreciate the changing sound over the years, but this album is completely out of place in what has been a great career.  This album lacks a soul and after hearing that Twisted Brown Trucker was not featured, I understood why.  Kenny Olsen got out at the right time...this ship has been sinking ever since.    The lyrics on this CD are redundant and boring and you've heard them all before by Kid Rock, except they were accompanied by much better music.  I found myself pushing 'Next' on almost each and every track and didn't find one song on the album worth putting on the mp3 player.  On the last few tracks Bob tries a high-pitched singing voice that is terrible; you can almost hear him losing his manhood right there.    Don't buy it.  Don't waste your money on it.  Joe C. is turning over as we speak.  R.I.P. RJ Ritchie the EMSP
B001UV4XFQ|1.0|The atrocious atmosphere that people have to look forward to thanks to reality tv series and consumerism comes to a head in this tale of nonsense that any hetrosexual male will shudder at.  These movies are part of the problem of society today,... shiny vampires and werewolves with inferiority complexes? Really guys?  Stop watching Jersey Shore and Real World reruns and get out and make something worthwhile that'll actually help children be creative and make something of themselves so they can in turn do the same for those who come after them.  I applaud the success of the author, but the commercialism that this monster has fed is just too much.  What is american society coming to?  Im ashamed to call myself american when my fellow countrymates can call this sham of entertainment a \\"great\\" movie.  This thing was horrible from beginning to end, with the only joy coming from the unbelieveably corny dialogue and even more unbelieveably corny kissing and staring scenes between the actors.  I laughed out loud in the theatre a few times only to be shushed by the female unit I accompanied who finds this type of movie enthralling for its cheeseball-ness.<br /><br />Spare your mortal soul from damnation, and your heterosexual male counterpart the torture of sitting through this rubbish by not purchasing it.... like there's any chance of that happening when women are involved...
B003VS0CX8|5.0|This release has been given the warmest response, particularly as to the Blu-ray remaster, the world over.  Might I respectfully suggest to those who are having trouble with the reproduction, as the one below comparing the new release to VHS, that they seriously have a professional agent visit their home and explain what is wrong with their equipment!
0517548232|5.0|What C.S. Lewis's \\"Mere Christianity\\" is to Christendom this book is to the world of economics. Why does the Post Office lose billions each year when FedEx and UPS make billions? Why does AmTrak always lose money when every other railroad in America make money? Why do government bailouts always end up failing? Read this book and you'll know the answers.<br /><br />It's not boring nor pedantic and you'll really come to an understanding of the folly and fecklessness of government intervention into the free market. A must read.
B004CJDSTA|5.0|Castle Season is very funny, romantic and action packed.  I particularly liked episode 9, \\"Close Encounters of the Murderous Kind\\" as Castle made reference to his former character on the shows Serenity and Firefly.  Becket asks why he knows Chinese and he says it's from a show he learned it from a show he use to like. If you are not familiar with his previous work it won't be funny.  I love the interaction between Becket and Castle.  This is an excellent show.  Can you have a light hearted murder?  Absolutely!  I enjoy the interaction between Castle and his mother and daughter as well.  Castle's mother wears great clothing and jewelry.  If you like fashion this show is for you as it's also very stylish.
0811876373|3.0|I love the idea of the cake pops and they look like they'll be fun to make, but my book is faulty.  20 pages in the middle of my book are upside down and backwards.  Makes it difficult to follow the recipe when they aren't in order and you have to flip the book upside down in the middle of a step.
0618918248|5.0|This is the one, the ultimate book to have for any atheist/agnostic/freethinker. Renowned scientist Richard Dawkins uses reason, logic and scientific evidence to debunk the notion that any deity exists: whether personal or impersonal. He also highlights the overwhelming lack of supernatural evidence for said deities. Add to all that the dangers associated with blind faith (slavery, 'holy wars', racism, sexism, etc...) and Dawkins effectively argues in favor of abandoning superstition in favor of sound reason, thus making this book essentially the \\"Freethinker's Bible\\". The only problem one might find with \\"The God Delusion\\" is the ruthless style with which Dawkins writes. I could see how such a stubborn stance by an atheist might turn off an equally stubborn fundamentalist believer who might otherwise be convinced to open his or her mind based on the evidence provided. Other than that, however, this book is a breath of fresh air (and reason) in a world suffocated by radical and irrational dogma. Overall, well worth the price.
B002JVWRAO|5.0|The Apocalypse has begun and there's just no stopping it... But Sam and Dean will try like Hell anyway.  This season does a good job of progressing the story along while still stopping to poke fun at the fans every once in a while just to keep them awake.    The return of Adam is a treat to anyone who enjoyed \\"Jump the Shark\\" from a previous season.  And the last few episodes are classically Kripke- captivating and very shocking.    A must have for any fan of the series.
B00275EHJQ|5.0|Pixar has done it again - they consistently blow away their competition.  The attention to detail in this film is phenomenal, and the plot and character development are very well done.  What an excellent follow-up to Toy Story and Toy Story 2.  Although parts of this film are a bit scary for very young children, it is a great family movie.  Highly recommended!
B000BB1MIC|1.0|I was buying this DVD as a birthday gift and didn't receive it even after the estimated delivery date. Because the USPS lost it during transit, the company couldn't do anything about it so they gave me a full refund of my money and I was out of a birthday gift. So now I have to take time and look for it again somewhere else. Although they did respond quickly about my problem.

1442337966|3.0|I think The Secret was better.  The 1st part of the CD talks about LOVE being the Power and she seems to repeat herself alot.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|Overall a pretty solid CD, with some great new hits on it. The new producer seems to have paid off, with some songs that are different for Josh Groban the new sound is great. Best songs Include \\"Hidden Away\\", \\"War at Home\\", \\"Voce Existe Em mim\\", and \\"Bells of New York City\\".

B000WS4QJG|5.0|I was impressed with some of the new versions of the songs he re-recorded, I especially loved P.Y.T.  and the best one, For all Time. I wish this was released back in 85, it's such a nice plushy sound. Michael never ceases to amaze me, Job well done. RIP Beautiful Boy. XX kitn
B003WKOLQO|4.0|A solid effort and consistent with the rest of their stuff.  I think it's great that Volbeat is not afraid to experiment and then make it work.    Am I the only one who can't understand what Mark \\"Barney\\" Greenway is saying?  Or is that the point?  I never got into Napalm Death for that reason.  I love the guitar riff in the beginning of Evelyn, but I am disappointed that I can't understand most of the words.
B0014VQGX4|2.0|We purchased the Bruder JCB Midi CX Loader Backhoe for our grandson's 3rd birthday. He loved it.  Sadly, only 2 months later and the front end loader is broken  where it attaches to the arm lifts.  The toy looks realistic but is not as sturdy as one would hope.  My recommendation, look elsewhere for this type of toy. It is not worth the money because it lacks durability.
0802136834|5.0|I loved this book! It's well researched and written in an accessible style that kept me gripped, even though I know the story well and have read many biographies on the subject. I'd definitely recommend it to anyone.
B003YWUTKM|5.0|Very interesting music from the Orb and David Gilmour.  I am certainly glad I got it. David is awesome like always and still remians the best.       Jim Constand
B0042JTDXK|4.0|I love all but one of the songs (the one after Hidden Away...it is WAY too heavy for this album, it would have been fine on one of the previous albums).  But it is clear that the songs on this album were selected more to fit Josh's heart and less his voice.  So the songs on this album, as with most artists, were selected to communicate rather than exemplify; that is what other artists get to do, so why not Josh? As fans, we have gotten used to songs that highlight Josh' voice, but apparently not songs that communicates what Josh wanted to say.  A few songs, Higher Window, Follow Me, the War at Home, are INCREDIBLY powerful, you can't help but listen to them over and over and over.  The emotion that comes through is stunning.  So I say...YOU GO JOSH!    I do have one criticism.  The orchestra almost overpowers Josh in some of the songs, which is a shame.  In the other albums, his voice was out front and center and the orchestra was definitely backup.  In a couple songs, there is a time or two when you almost can't hear what Josh is singing!  I'm really surprised they let that through.
B001U887WE|5.0|My Crocs arrived quickly and exactly as described. They fit great, but you can't wear too thick of a sock with it. I wouldn't want to though since they're so warm and cozy! They are pretty stiff right now, but that's to be expected with it being a new shoe. Plus, it's nice to know they've got some thickness to them for holding up over different terrain, since I wear these constantly through the winter. I would definitely recommend these shoes!
0756665949|5.0|Fabulous and thorough book that includes every aspect of the six years of Lost, including the actors and even obscure props.  A great memento for all LOST fans.
B003NX6ZDC|5.0|This release took me by surprise, I'm not a huge fan of <<the killers>> although I do have a few of their CDs.  Brandon Flowers does a great Las Vegas themed concept album here. I love Daniel Lanois production and  Flowers' writing. Emmylou Harris' backup vocal on \\"Hard Enough\\" are just icing on the cake.  The album gets better on repeated listens, always the sign of a good classic recording.  Flowers is heavily influenced by British rock, so much so, that I always assumed he *was* British.  He's actually an American Mormon who lived in Las Vegas, such a nice irony......  this ironic twist shows up in this album & especially the first track \\"Welcome to Fabulous Las Vegas\\"  The music is fun and really stands up!
B001K3JF7K|5.0|This album is Diane's best. She sounds a lot like Peggy Lee. Her new soft sound is very sexy. She has finally learned the best for her type of voice.
B002ZG99A4|4.0|Those going into The Expendables should know what they're getting beforehand: a knock-down, over the top 80s throwback action blast that represents some of the best qualities of the 80s action flicks that star/director Sylvester Stallone made famous.  Stallone stars as Barney, leader of a team of mercenaries (which also includes Jason Statham, Jet Li, Terry Crews, Randy Couture, and Dolph Lundgren) that gets way in over their heads when employed to overthrow a South American dictator (Dexter's David Zayas) and the beyond bad crew (Eric Roberts and Steve Austin) pulling the strings behind the scenes.  Story and dialogue take second place to the action sequences, which are wonderfully orchestrated and filmed, yet nowhere near as graphic or gut-churning as what Stallone managed to pump out with 2008s Rambo.  Not to mention the fact that there are more than a few moments where the film takes itself too seriously, which does detract from the overall notion that this is a bona-fide guilty pleasure kind of action movie that boasts the best throwback action cast, well, maybe ever.  Like I said, if the aforementioned cast members aren't enough for you, how about Mickey Rourke, Gary Daniels, and unbilled cameos from Bruce Willis and Arnold Schwarzenegger?  Or ample eye-candy in the form of Giselle Itie and Charisma Carpenter?  There's just so many feel-good aspects about The Expendables that it soon becomes easy to overlook its flaws, and that in itself is nothing less than an achievement.  All in all, if you don't get any amount of enjoyment out of The Expendables, you should check your pulse at the very least.
044654146X|5.0|Innovation and venture capital are the main engines for creating individual and national wealth. Take Israel, for example, say authors Dan Senor and Saul Singer, who portray the nation as a blueprint for how to launch innovative ventures. They profile the cultural, military and economic characteristics that make it the world's most entrepreneurial nation. This uplifting, inspiring business story explains how Israeli entrepreneurs overcame significant challenges and analyzes how a country's culture influences its business climate. getAbstract finds that this well-informed text offers solid lessons about maintaining national competitiveness in the 21st century.

0307266303|5.0|Brilliantly written with lovely old school storylike sketches strewn in. Stories that would remind you of a warm fire, grandpa and his pipe with wide eyed kids all lying around, some scared and some smiling with excitement. A romantic portrayal for story telling, myth, folk and legend.. McDougall bags it all. Capturing beautifully the characters, scenes and excitment. It pulls you deep into the mystical world of the strange or indeed not so strange tarahumara people and the man who's running away from something. Something that you just can't put your finger on, precisely enough to satisfy your wonderment..caballo.

B00454U1NS|4.0|Pink was not only the unlikeliest of pop stars to grab the reins of success in the 2000s, but she outdid her similarly marketed contemporaries, scoring an impressive succession of hit singles. Even when she hit bumps in the road she bounced back, adding different elements to her sound without changing its core. She is one of the few who hit the mainstream circa 1999 who maintains staying power, and \\"Greatest Hits...So Far!!!\\" proves why.<br /><br />There are a few hits missing - the attitudinal \\"You Make Me Sick\\" from her debut album and \\"Feel Good Time,\\" a delightful collaboration with William Orbit from the \\"Charlies Angels: Full Throttle\\" soundtrack, are among them - but \\"Greatest Hits...So Far!!!\\" is also an overstuffed disc with over a dozen hits and new material as well to round out the package.<br /><br />The tracks are sequenced well. It is no surprise to see the major hits from her career-changing \\"Missundaztood\\" album frontload this compilation. It has been a long while since that album's release, and the casual fan a hits collection like this one is aimed would be easily won over by their inclusion. It is no surprise that the witty, sarcastic, self-deprecating \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" scored her major success and that the hook-laden confessional \\"Just Like a Pill\\" continued it.<br /><br />This is before considering the major crossover success of \\"Get the Party Started,\\" which showcased her brash personality while broadening her fan base and the thoughtful, pensive, lyrically incisive \\"Family Portrait.\\"<br /><br />The hits continued, even though \\"Trouble\\" was the only major one she scored from 2003's \\"Try This.\\" When it crashed into the Hot 100 the irrepressibly catchy, mightily intelligent \\"Stupid Girls\\" became one of her biggest hits immediately - and it remains one of the most impressive pop singles of the 2000s. \\"So What\\" gave her a new career milestone, becoming her first solo #1 hit.<br /><br />Other tracks included are smaller hits than some not included - the highly imaginative \\"Glitter In the Air\\" was really only a novelty hit following her show-stopping performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards, hitting #18 the following week and then descending the charts - but they still round out the disc nicely.<br /><br />The new material included does not live up to the cache and punch of the majority of the hits. \\"Raise Your Glass\\" is festive and fun, but \\"[...] Perfect\\" and \\"Heartbreak Down\\" sound like rejects not deemed not strong enough for conclusion. They are inspired, demonstrating Pink's artistic drive, but are not particularly memorable.<br /><br />International versions of the album include the raw, impressive \\"Whataya Want from Me.\\" The song, which she wrote for her \\"Funhouse\\" album - was unwisely cut from that CD and given to Adam Lambert, who scored his first major hit with it last year.ed - the highly imaginative \\"Glitter In the Air\\" was really only a novelty hit following her show-stopping performance at the 2010 Grammy Awards, hitting #18 the following week and then descending the charts - but they still round out the disc nicely.<br /><br />The new material included does not live up to the cache and punch of the majority of the hits. \\"Raise Your Glass\\" is festive and fun, but \\"[...] Perfect\\" and \\"Heartbreak Down\\" sound like rejects not deemed not strong enough for conclusion.

But, sometimes information is not enough to help us change our ways.  And that is what I love about this and all of Kris Carr's books.  Her love and wit and excitement and well, sexiness, entice you to join in.  Face it, living vegan means leaving a lot that we hold dear and forging a new identity.

B002VKE1K2|4.0|I wathced this a 2nd time after watching the sequel and all I can say is this was much more creepy than the 2nd one. The 2nd one was slow and boring until the end. It used loub booms and bangs to try and scare you, lame.<br />This movie did not take long to get into the good stuff happening. Better effects and more evil sounding noises. I am not sure why the critics said the 2nd one is better than the first because I find it to be the opposite but everyone is different.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have read highly polarized reviews of this album. Some raved about the beauty, others were very critical of the changes.  As usual Mr. Groban's work is hard to categorize or classify.  This collection is different than his previous albums. It is more personal in content and presentation. The simplified production reminds me of a wandering troubador. If a person tries to judge the album analytically they will perhaps find things to complain about. However, when we the listeners \\"lose ourselves tonight\\" in the lyrical flow of the music we can be transported and enthralled by the story told in each song.

For those who did not watch it week after week on TV, this dvd pack is worth it. You do not have to wait a whole week to find out what happened in the next 40 minutes. The presentation style of 24 is unique with real time feel to it. I recommend this to anyone who like action thriller.

Keith came through on this cd. Still listening to the music. I see that in Australia they have 11 songs listed for their cd. Well worth the purchase if you love Keith music at Target!
B001R0XNSI|5.0|I ordered this on a whim but I am quite happy with it.    When I received it the first thing I thought was wow this thing is huge, it's like one of those giant markers that sit in the back of a draw and you never use until you move house or something, but then I took the cap off and the tip is a lot smaller than you would imagine for a pen this size, it's actually a fine tip sharpie and works very well with the jumbo grip.    It's very light so I now carry it in my laptop case everywhere I go.    It's very thick walls and overall size make it a very capable striking instrument, I let loose on a chunk of old drywall in the garage and it did some real damage, you can put some weight behind it and it wont break, very good to know if you're ever attacked by drywall, you can focus a lot of energy into a very small point.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|if you're a fan of christmas or annie lennox or both, this cd is amazing!  knowing what a charitable person she is is just all the more reason to love it ... some of the songs are on none of my other christmas collections and the arrangements for the most familiar of them are original but 'respectful'.... couldn't wait for it to come out today and have been listening to it over and over and over.
B003Y58CKS|4.0|I don't have much to offer that the 3 previous reviewers haven't covered. The additional praise must be for the marvelous costumes in the opening scene.                                                                                    As for the negative; if someone hasn't already done so, please tell Florez that when he is being recorded in a live performance to stop closing his eyes in the middle of an aria . Stay in character and stop acting as if you're singing to yourself in the shower. Yes, Pavarotti did it regularly but at the end and not during an aria. It is really distracting to this viewer, almost as bad as some singers glancing at the conductor or prompter. Stay in character when being recorded live.
B000SM7QUC|5.0|I did read the book \\"The Heroin Diaries\\" before I ever listened to this CD, but honestly, I think you can enjoy the CD without ever reading the book (I recommend reading the book though, it was PHENOMENAL)!<br /><br />That said, I have to say, my favorite part of this CD is the vocals - wow!  Even on pretty standard rock songs, the vocals stand out, they are the perfect complement to the music.  The last minute or so of the song \\"Van Nuys\\" has some of the strongest vocals on the album, as does the song \\"The Girl With Golden Eyes\\".  The guitar riffs are catchy, and I really love the spoken-word parts where Nikki overlays him reading his diary entries over the music.<br /><br />There is a lot of piano/keyboard in this CD as well, which I personally LOVE!  One of my favorite bands from way back is Savatage, and they do a lot of piano/guitar stuff, which has always been my main attraction to their music, so to see that blend here in Sixx A.M. was awesome!  I hate when people say that piano and keyboards make music too \\"wimpy\\" - as this CD shows, you can have piano in your songs and still rock out.<br /><br />The whole CD just comes across as very well-orchestrated, the mix/production on it is outstanding, and it's in heavy rotation in my CD player (yes, I'm old school, I still listen to CD's as opposed to iPods/digital media!).  Actually, I'm surprised more songs weren't released as singles.<br /><br />On a side note - lyrically, I love this album even more - heh, \\"album\\", yes, I supposed once again, I'm showing how outdated I am, though I'm only 33 years old!  Anyway, I will say I am a recovering addict myself - albeit, for a different D.O.C. - but still, it touched home for me in so many ways, and I can really relate to the messages on here.  I will also say, I don't think you have to be an addict, or recovering one, to find the message in the lyrics inspirational at times :)<br /><br />For anyone who thinks Motley solo projects suck based on the utter boredom that was Vince Neil's \\"Tattoos & Tequila\\" undertaking, please give this a listen and think again! :)undertaking, please give this a listen and think again! :)
B004259BMM|5.0|A great album from Keith Urban for a value price. Each song is beautifully crafted with excellent vocals and instrumental work by Keith. A variety of music from the rocking Put You in A Song, to the gorgeous ballad All For You. Add some great fun with sing a long classics like You Gonna Fly and Long Hot Summer. Then sit back and enjoy Keith at his best with Georgia Woods and Right on Back to You. Listen to the hearfelt emotion of Without You and empathize with a couple realizing it's just better to Shut Out The Lights and look at things again in the morning. Another hit that will translate to a blazing hot new tour.
B0043GAZYS|5.0|This movie looked really stupid from the previews and just the basic premise, but I saw it on a whim and LOVED it.  The film has such a great cast of characters, has some very clever comedy, great cinematography, and a very unique visual style.  Director Edgar Wright really proves himself as a very talented director with this film.  Even if you're not a fan of video games, comics, or not part of the demographic that this film was going for, I'd recommend checking it out.
B004259BMM|5.0|Keith has definitely done it again!  Can't decide on a favorite song as of yet - usually takes me a bit, and I change my mind numerous times!  I would probably say that, if I had to choose a song I would \\"skip\\", it would be the opening single, \\"Put You In A Song\\".  Not bad, and I'm starting to like it a bit more, but the rest of the songs are much better!    Take a chance - buy the CD!!
0307454541|4.0|There are already plenty of plot summaries, so I'll try to keep this short:<br /><br />It took me a while to get into this book but it became tough to put down after the first hundred or so pages.  There are a lot of characters, but Larsson does a nice job creating a pretty clear image of each one, so it is fairly easy to keep them all straight.  He provides a chart of characters at the beginning that I thought was a nice touch.<br /><br />The story comes together well, and I found myself quite satisfied with the outcome.  I also enjoyed the minor differences in Swedish versus American culture, most notably around the Swedes liberal attitude toward sex.  A lot of American pop fiction writers use heavy, almost awkward sexual scenes in their work, whereas Larsson sprinkles sex lightly about with no more meaning than having a cup of coffee. It was actually quite refreshing.<br /><br />A review is less useful without some criticism, so here goes:  As the complex mystery and associated crime began to unfold, I felt like Larsson went over the top and made what was a believe story (sort-of) into a very far fetched one.  To me, it was already a great mystery; he could have toned it down and still had the desired effect.  I am being vague intentionally for those who haven't read the book yet.<br /><br />All in all, I can enthusiastically recommend The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo; just be prepared to suspend your disbelief in a few sections.
B004ASVS0E|5.0|This woman ROCKS!  I just can't get enough.  This will be my best Christmas ever.  Heck I'll probably go and get a Christmas Tree for the first time in 20 years because of this album.

B00275EHJQ|5.0|All Toy Story movies have been great, but this one is by far the best. The story is great, is funny and sad, and it has new characters that are really great.<br />The animations of course are awesome as everything that Pixar does.<br />I even cried at the end of the movie like a little girl! Loved the movie and my toddler has watched it over 20 times already since we got it.<br />He gets home and asks for more Toy Story!
0760703329|5.0|As the owner of a number of rare leather books I was a bit skeptical about the Barnes and Noble Leatherbound Classics.  However, I have purchased two of them, the first being The Complete Works of Shakespeare and I am very pleased.  It does not have the same quality elements as say an Easton Press book, but for the price I think it is great.<br /><br />On the outside this book is very nice looking.  The decorations are attractive and it has four raised hubs on the spine.  To me it has a nice feel and seems durable.  It does not at all give the sense of being cheaply constructed which is what I at first expected for the price.<br /><br />On the inside I enjoy the contents and the lay out.  There are however a couple of possible concerns.  First is that the paper is fairly thin and somewhat transparent.  You can definately see through a page to the writing on the other side.  If this bothers you it may not be the version you want.  Second is that the type is a bit small.  If you do not have good reading eyes, again this may not be the copy for you.  It is a bit reminiscent of a standard bible on the inside.  There are also some places in which the type is slightly faded or has various imperfections.  I dont find it to be particularly bad considering this is a value buy.  I think these are simply a result of the massive amount of content in the book.  The complete works of shakespeare coming to nearly 1300 pages.<br /><br />All in all I think this book looks great on the shelf, has a very large amount of content for the price, and seems to me like it will last fairly well.  The only concern I have is the readability of the print for some people.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I am currently on my third listen of this album since I bought it this afternoon, and I have to say that, while different than his other four, it is still simply amazing. Josh is such a talented singer and pianist, and I think this album showcases that superbly, as always. In addition to that, it shows just how much he has grown as an artist, even since \\"Awake\\": he also wrote/cowrote most of the songs, which i think it astounding, because you don't often see that. Favorite songs include: \\"The Wandering Kind\\" (I thought it was neat that Josh included a purely instrumental piece on his album; we haven't seen that yet from him!); \\"Bells of New York City\\" (this is second only to \\"Hidden Away\\" as my favorite on this album; it's beautiful!); \\"L'Ora Dell'Addio\\"; \\"Hidden Away,\\" of course (I have loved this since he released it on his site); \\"Higher Window\\"; \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\"; and \\"London Hymn\\" (though I thought it was almost too short, I really liked the cathedral-feel of this song). I have been waiting since \\"Awake\\" was released for another album, and counting down to November 15th since he announced the release date, and I am definitely not disappointed!
0812550706|5.0|Simply the best science fiction novel.    Three reasons:  1. Unquestionably one of the easiest books for an introduction to Science Fiction.  2. Mystery, suspense, tons of action, and a very gray ending. They sum up to a powerful story leaving the reader craving more!  3. It is a unique universe and story that, while it draws on some ideas from books like \\"Starship Troopers\\", paints a space marine saga in a very original light.    It's concise. It takes sharp turns. There is a hero you will love. I cannot recommend this book enough.    Robert Kenneth Perlstein
B003YUC2FE|3.0|I was also so excited to get all three in a gift set.  However, when I received, it was a cheap looking cardboard box holding the dvds.  It would have been a much better collector's item if the box was at least tin.
B002AOWXQ8|5.0|I can't express how original and good this CD is.  And their shows outrageous.  This is the best live show I have seen in a long long time.  I would say in my top 5 of all times.  I saw them at Coachella and Outsidelands, and more recently at a taping of Jimmy Kimmel.  If you can see these guys at a small venue, don't pass up the chance.  Alex, seems like one of the most down to earth, comfortable in his own skin person I have ever seen performing.  King Khan and the Shrines was up there as well.  I took a group of Brazilians to Jimmy Kimmel who had never heard this band before and they absolutely loved the music and the show.  Edward Sharpe and the Magnetic zeros are a great band, with great music, and great people.  They are what is right in the music industry.  Lyrical content is solid, positive, and they bring tons of energy and good vibes through in their music.  My favorite line from my favorite song Up From Below on the album \\"Drugs, drugs, drug me down.  Killing light, killing sound.\\"  This song is just an anthem that is oozing with revelation.  They build it up so well live too.    I have read some of the negetive comments here and I disagree, obviously because of the 5 star rating.  I think the sound is perfect for this album, it doesn't sound like cheap overdub after overdub too prevalant in most albums released today.  I can somewhat understand about one commenter about the first few songs are good but the end of the album is filler.  Although I don't agree I can understand this point of view.  My advice to you is that you haven't listen carefully enough.  The first few songs are definately the catchiest of the bunch, but the whole album is just a gem.  But I can see the turning point in the album on Desert Song, it is an intense song that shifts the albums feel.  It is placed quite nicely in the middle of the album.  Om Nashi Me is perfect closing song for the album and they seem to play this song last every time I have seen them.  Believe me, you willbe singing this song all the way to your car in the parking lot.  This album is amazing, do yourself a favor and purchase, download it, whatever.  If not you will be missing out on the next best thing.  Also, see them live.  I first discovered this band just before Coachella, and the show was not that crowded.  Then Home and Janglin were songs on car commercials.  5 months later at Outsidelands the show was packed.  I was so far back it was unbelievable.  It didn't hurt that these guys are pretty popular in San Francisco.  But check them out now before they blow up and you are sitting in the nose bleeds at Wrigley field pissed of that you are so far back, someone spilt beer on your shoes and you didn't listen to my advice sooner.
B002ZG999U|1.0|Wow was this film a disappointment.  There was barely a single coherent thing that went on.  Look, I don't expect top-notch quality stuff from action films, but I do expect a little charisma, which this utterly lacked.  See Red (and a better Bruce Willis) for examples on how to competently do that.  Anyway, the absolute crappiest thing about this movie was the editing/cutting of scenes.  The film itself may have not been half bad, but Sylvester Stallone needs to take film/cinematography 101 over again.  WAY too many close-ups, way too many jump cuts and just way too much ADD with the camera.  I'd like to actually see what was going on thank-you-very-much! Oh wait, but then maybe I'd realize how truly idiotic the whole thing is.  2010 is the worst year for films in quite some time, and this stands out among them at the top of the dump.

B001GJOL22|5.0|Having had the common dvd already and knowing the sound of Blu-ray, I got this dvd. The picture is fine and the sound is a speaker punching, wall shaking riot. Not to say that it is not as clear as a bell. Just listen to the cymbals come thru the mix.  If RUSH is your thing-- get this dvd.
B00447G2MK|2.0|Let's get this out on the table first: if you like harder \\"pop-rock\\" then this cd is definitely going to be for you. ADTR will always make good music because they are extremely talented, have great vocals and play their instruments better than most bands out there right now. The songs are catchy, there are some decent hooks, etc. If you blindly stuck your hand into a bin full of this kind of music and this is what you found, you would rave to your friends at the gem you discovered.    However...if you are a fan of ADTR and have their back catalog then this cd sorely disappoints. This was easily my most anticipated album of 2010 and I sat with my mouth agape at how far they jumped the shark to mainstream. Sure, Sticks and Bricks is great and is about as close as they come to the Treason/Homesick sound, but the rest of it is local rock station radio music that gets lost with the other bands who all sound the same. ADTR was so appealing because they did what very few bands of their genre could: they appealed to a wider audience because they played real, well-written, deep music. Even if you didn't like the screams you appreciated how they fit into the songs and even if you didn't appreciate the catchy-ness of the hooks you knew they worked. With this album, they went with the money and didn't stay true to themselves, and it shows.    I gave it a couple good listens and just can't get behind it. I'll keep a few of the tracks and go on with my life searching for another band that can replace them in my life.
B002QKZLZ6|4.0|So you've invested some money into buying one of the best bluetooth headsets on the market, now what? You want to carry it on you in a fashionable, practical and secure manner! Sticking it in your pocket, purse, or car's gloves compartment is just not adequate because: 1) you may damage your not-so-cheap gadget, 2) higher chance of loosing it permanently or temporarily, when you need it the most! Believe me, it happened with me!!<br /><br />Now back to our favorable Plantronics Leather Carrying Case: the design is so simple & sleek; it has a nice leather feel to it;  strong belt clip; secure magnetic flap closure; soft interior; snag fit.<br /><br />On the down side: some reviewers have rightfully stated you may need to push down on your headset as you put it back in the case, but with all honesty : no biggie!!<br /><br />Bottom line: After having it for well over a month, its a must-buy companion to your plantronics Pro Headset.

B001MYIXAC|5.0|Bram Stoker would be shaking in his coffin if he were to see how vampires are being portrayed today on TV and in Movies.  Movies like \\"Twilight\\" and TV shows like \\"Vampire Diaries\\" are bringing Vampires out in the daytime, having them in intimate relationships dealing with \\"high school\\" drama.  Thankfully directors such as Neil Jordan (\\"Interview with The Vampire\\") and Tomas Alfredson stayed true to the legend of the Vampire.<br /><br />\\"Let The Right One In\\", starring Kåre Hedebrant as \\"Oskar\\" and Lina Leandersson as \\"Eli\\" brings the classic vampire tale back with a unique twist.  The film is based on the book by the same name from Swedish author John Ajvide Lindqvist.  \\"Let The Right One In\\" begins with a man out in the woods collecting blood from a recently killed person.  Little do we know this collection is for a 12 year old vampire who has been living for hundreds of years.  It is a fresh take on the classic vampire dilemma: finding food and staying out of site and sun.<br /><br />One of the many things this film got right was the atmosphere.  This is a Swedish film and was shot entirely in Sweden.  This was the perfect setting for a film like this.  The constant snow fall and dreary look of the town really added to the realism of the movie.  Unlike \\"Interview with The Vampire\\", I could relate more to this modern setting.  The director chose exactly the right times for the music score to come in.  He didn't saturate every moment like a lot of horror directors tend to do.<br /><br />This story is a lot more than just a vampire girl trying to survive.  It is also a story of love and redemption.  Oskar is constantly being bullied by the local kids and he is always so retreated and alone.  Eli brings a sense of wonder to his life.  He finds in her an oddness that brings him out of his shell.  He builds a relationship with her carefully and slowly. She teaches him how to stand up for himself and gives him confidence.  It is an interesting back and forth between the two as their relationship builds.  A testament to the director and the actors.<br /><br />This is a wonderful film that has single-handedly brought a genre out of the \\"sparkly\\" hole vampire films have been in for the last few years.<br /><br />[...]hip builds.

B0042JTDXK|2.0|This CD is HUGELY disappointing.  Over all it's a 2 out of 5.  Josh's voice sounds great, he tries to go for a few too many high notes which is new for him but the most upsetting thing about the CD is that the songs are so cliché and trite.  It seems like he pushed this CD out because he felt he had to not because his heart was in it or that he wanted to.  There is no powerful \\"You Raise Me Up\\" or \\"You Are Loved\\" on this CD.  Over all the CD lacks the passion and depth of his previous music.  I would recommend you really listen to the music's samples before you buy this entire CD.  I would pick and choose the songs you like and buy them as MP3 rather than the entire CD.

B003XRDYX2|4.0|Bob Dylan is the king of bootlegs. Even before he started officially releasing his catalog, his fans were collecting and trading his unreleased out-takes and concerts.<br /><br />The latest release of The Original Mono Recordings is largely a waste of time, unless you don't already own these CDs or albums.<br /><br />Collectors and completists will want the whole package and may find this review offensive.<br /><br />There is nothing new here when compared with with earlier official bootlegs such as  Tell Tale Signs, Basement Tapes or The Bootleg Series, Vols. 1-3 : Rare And Unreleased, 1961-1991.<br /><br />I'm probably the only reviewer who listened to all nine CDs, the original vinyl and the SACD releases to compare the differences, which is why it took 3 weeks to prepare the review.<br /><br />You only only listen to so much Dylan in a given day. I've played this set over and over to figure out what was of value.<br /><br />What you get in the package: Bob Dylan The Original Mono Recording, cute packaging with tiny print; the release of Bob Dylan's first 8 LPs includes: 9 CDs, a free digital download, booklet by Greil Marcus, bonus CD of  Dylan's 1963 Brandeis University concert, in a hardboard slip case.<br /><br />The cases are miniature versions of the original LP covers. That's cute but you can't hold them in your hand and read the liner notes so what's the point?<br /><br />On the SACD release, the covers are three folds that allow the liner notes to be legibly printed or include a booklet.<br /><br />Compared with holding the original albums in your hand while listening, this set is low on creating 60s nostalgia.<br /><br />The booklet with pictures and notes by Greil Marcus is another exercise on miniaturization and perhaps the only reason to purchase the The Original Mono Recordings (Vinyl) at a whopping $205.<br /><br />The digital download in high quality 320 Kpbs mp3 format was a bonus if the set was ordered directly from Sony. I didn't expect to get this from Amazon.com.<br /><br />The download comes compressed in an 890 MB file which easily extracted in one sub-directory. It was simple work to make 8 sub-directories for each LP and move the files.<br /><br />In reality, Windows Media Player or a variety of programs can make mp3s or WAV rips of the CDs once you own them, which is  legal in Canada.<br /><br />So what's the big deal about \\"Original Mono\\" versions? Are they better, more like the original?<br /><br />Greil Marcus waxes eloquent about listening to Bob Dylan through one speaker up in our bedrooms back in the 1960s, in the accompanying booklet to this package.<br /><br />It is true that most people heard Bob Dylan in mono back in the 1960s. However, some of us had stereo and the difference is not worth spending $100 to hear.<br /><br />It's like the overblown production of The Beatles Mono last year. Everyone raved about them in reviews and we all listened to the stereo versions if we wanted to hear the music. Is this a gimmick we will have to endure each fall as the greats of rock and roll re-issue their catalogs in mono?<br /><br />In reality, from Bob Dylan to Another Side of Bob Dylan are mono - the man and his guitar.<br /><br />From Bringing it All Back Home - the break out rock and roll album - to John Wesley Harding the CDs should be listened to in stereo. The Mono versions squeeze the instruments into one speaker which destroys definition.<br /><br />When people rave on about the great sound that was recorded in the 1960s get them to give their heads a collective shake.  The recording back then was primitive with tape noise, lack of detail and distortion.<br /><br />The Original Mono recordings can't make a silk purse out of a sow's ear. If you listen closely to Bringing It All Back Home there is plenty of 1960s distortion.<br /><br />The Original Mono are not as clear as the SACD Bob Dylan - Limited Edition Catalog Box Set. Like most modern CDs, the bass is pumped up at the expense of detail. On the original vinyl LPs, the bass sounds real with actual notes, dynamics and overtones. On the Original Mono it's more like a louder \\"thump, thump, thump\\".<br /><br />Bob Dylan's first 8 albums<br /><br />There are millions of Dylan fans who don't have the originals for whom this collection will be a revelation. Since I've been following Dylan since he hit the folk scene 1961, these albums are old friends.<br /><br />From Bob Dylan to John Wesley Harding is a span of  5 years in which Bob Dylan changed folk music and rock and roll with the prodigious output of 83 songs composed and recorded.  Most of the songs are classics such as \\"Blowin in the Wind\\", \\"Like A Rolling Stone\\", \\"All Along The Watchtower,\\" Don't Think Twice It's All Right. These are songs that have been covered by everyone and become part of our lives.<br /><br />Bob Dylan songs were meant to be sung by everyone, and everyone has obliged Dylan. They are songs of protest, of love, love gone wrong, get even songs and have a good time songs. They are simple and complex, weird lyrics that spin off into infinity and lyrics grounded in the feeling of seeing someone you love coming along the beach.<br /><br />After Bob Dylan, singers had to get busy and write their own songs. Many tried to follow his lead but few made the transition from corny tin-pan-alley to the hip world. John Prine is one who emulated Dylan and succeeded.first 8 albums    There are millions of Dylan fans who don't have the originals for whom this collection will be a revelation.

B003YWUTJI|3.0|This cd has a few songs that I personally like.  'Bull Rider', 'Loretta', and 'Creepin' In' are all great songs if you enjoy older country.  I'm a fan of her duets, but when she sings in general on a few of these songs, it's lacking individuality. They all start to mash together and it sounds too familiar.  I also really liked that she changed it up and recorded songs with a few hip hop artists.  'Take off your Cool' and 'Life is Better' are both surprisingly good. Her voice sounds more soulful backing the hip hop tracks.  There are some songs on here I thought I would like considering I'm a fan of the artist, but they fell short for me.
B003XMUFGQ|5.0|I think even people who are not fans of Eric Clapton would enjoy this album. It is filled with terrific blues numbers - standards and new material. The sound's production as well as the other musicians are of the highest quality. Eric plays straight blues here and there are no surprises. He is still in good form and his playing has become even more an integral part of the music, instead of becoming the focus of the music. His rendition of the old classic 'Autumn Leaves' is beautiful and it's a side of him that we've hardly seen before. Some may be disappointed that there aren't blistering solos and that the album has a relaxed quality but I believe the intention was there to create the sound, voicings and quality that was achieved.

I was glad to have gone early, because I wasn't alone and when I left the store, there were only a few copies left.    The book has five pop ups, which are of Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, Magical Creatures, Magical Games and sports and the Dark Arts and they're accompanied by little side pop ups and interactive features.  I'm amazed at how much stuff they put into the book.  I feel like every time I open it, there is something I hadn't seen before.     I think all the pop ups are great, but where are Ron and Hermione?  They are nowhere in this book.  I would have liked to see them in at least one pop up.  Even though there is no supporting cast, I still think this book is a must have for all Potter fans.

B001F7MSFM|5.0|I just wanted to say to amazon and hastings I'm really happy with my purchase. I just ordered hell boy II this sunday I got it today 11/17/10. The cases are good and the dvds are not scratched up. This is pretty much why I keep ordering from hastings so much. From the bottom of my heart, thank you...
0307454541|3.0|Lisbeth Salander is the greatest character in modern fiction.  I am in AWE of her intellect, and feel both physical attraction and sympathy for her.  Those emotions normally aren't linked in story, but Larrson is masterful in writing this complex character.  It is the primary reason this series is so immensely popular.<br /><br />So, why do I only give the series 3 stars?<br /><br />The first book tells an interesting story AROUND Lisbeth.  Blomkvist is a reporter introduced to a compelling mystery while his world is crumbling.  Salander is an investigator who works her way onto the case as we learn more about her.  The story was good, but Lisbeth made the book difficult to put down.<br /><br />In 2 books that followed, she was ALL that I cared about.  Larsson delivers tolerable reads, but only the sections with Lisbeth were gripping.  I glossed over sections without her and was still able to follow the story.<br /><br />He oversaturates the books with bit characters. Larrson devotes great detail to people and moments that don't require the attention.  Shortening each book by 100 pages would have improved this series.<br /><br />My advice would be to read the entire first book and, in reading the next 2 books, skip ahead to the sections about Lisbeth.  That sounds crazy, but you'll thank me.

B001L5Q5O8|1.0|I really wanted to download a legal copy of this EP tonight, but I can't. It's not available for download ANYWHERE. Not legally, anyway. So, my only option if I want to have this right now is to download it illegally from a file sharing service. Sorry, Big Machine Records, and Taylor (if you would have gotten a royalty from the sale). I sit before my computer, wallet open, saying \\"Here is my money, please take it!\\" to which BMR replies \\"No. We don't want your money. Go ---- yourself, consumer.\\"
B001CTUI8M|4.0|Heard this group on Pandora.  After viewing on Youtube I had to order this dvd.  I was not disappointed!

0626078474|5.0|I was supposed to have read this book in Mrs. Braswell's tenth-grade American literature class sometime in my 1989-90 sophomore year.  Instead, I was imbibing fantasy novels by Raymond Feist and daydreaming about what life would be like with a driver's license.  Now, twenty years later, I'm fairly pleased with myself for putting off such great writing until my early-middle years when I'm far more capable of appreciating its quality and the depth of the moral tale Harper Lee has bestowed upon the world from her humble memories of childhood in Alabama.    As Scout Finch puts it, I'm a \\"person of no background\\" (i.e., born and raised in north Alabama), but that doesn't mean I don't recognize the very common human elements faced by the small-town folks in Lee's novel.  The struggles are universal and, unfortunately, some are not eroded by time.    I enjoyed the tale-spinning of the novel, it sucked me in.  The themes are still relevant.  I whole-heartedly recommend it to any audience.  There's a reason the classics survive.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|GROW UP!! Don't rate the movie one star just because you lack the self-control to wait for the release that you really want. Pretty much all film makers do this stuff. On a film like Avatar, which cost SO much to make, they have to pull these marketing ploys to make their money back and earn a profit. Keep in mind that these profits go to help fund other movies sometimes! Film companies put out dozens of movies, most of them flop or barely make their money back-- when they get a hit they have to cash in. It's just reality.     Anyway, back to the main point of a review. The movie is awesome. Buy it! That is, unless you want the 3D version, in which case you should exercise some self control and wait for the next release. Most people don't have 3d tvs and aren't going to get one probably for years, so this version is just fine for most.
159562015X|3.0|Required for class. Too Psycho babbly for me. Came as promised. No complaints. Inexpensive. I'll sell it. Maybe someone can use it on their coffee table or in waiting room.
B002M2T1UO|5.0|I really can't recommend this enough. I got this when it was a gold box deal for 60 bucks, WHAT A STEAL! Even for 110 or whatever it is now it's an awesome deal.     The Wire and The Shield are THE two cop shows you NEED! Don't miss out!
B003XQRZ7E|3.0|I've waited for weeks and listened to this cd several times. I couldn't wait for its arrival, but I'm really not that impressed. I have almost all of Glen Hughes music, I like Joe, Jason, & Derek, but this is only and honestly a 3 good song cd. I wanted more, Glen is a great vocalist & bass player,,but the songs are the problem. I'm sorry, I wish I was wrong but I'm not.
B004CD7OCI|5.0|I'd just like to say this is one of the freshest series on TV I've seen to date. It may be a zombie apocalypse story, but it's unlike anything you've ever seen or imagined before. The characters are believable. The story-lines are taught and well-written. Acting is great. Like the other reviews, the zombie effects are scarily real. It's as if this actually happened and now you're allowed a look into the survivor's lives. All I can say is to watch Sundays on AMC. I'm hooked.
B0040JHWKS|3.0|Are you trying to tell me no one notices that he recently re-recorded many of the songs on The Promise? These are not all old recordings. Some had parts added and some were completely recorded recently. For myself and many oldtime fans, this kind of taints the whole idea of lost recordings. The older recordings are much better than the newer ones. Without the new recordings, I would have given it 5 stars.
0385338724|4.0|I adored this book and the main character, Lexi.  I loved her wit and charm.  I laughed out loud a few times and I even cried a tear or two.  I could really feel her frustration trying to navigate this new world.  It was sort of like a mystery, suspense trying to unravel those lost years and what would happen to change someone so drastically.  I didn't want it to end and would really enjoy a sequel to see how it all plays out.
B00447G29S|5.0|Just received this new 3D title and was very happy with the product.  I already owned the DVD copy, but this 3D version brought the video to a new level.  Well worth the cost, and a great product.  The 3D effects were excellent and the audio excellent.  This 3D film has set the 'bar' for 3D expectations and this film was a convert 2D to 3D vice native 3D.  I expect we will see even better 3D effects if native 3D    This is a must buy 3D film-very happy I bought it as one of my first 3Ds.
B002LC2DQ4|4.0|Just as the description stated. The xD card fits the bill for my purposes and found to be very reliable over many, many rewrites.
B001P3SA94|5.0|A very good movie. I love the music in it and I also Love the fact that the actors actually did there own singing. I recommend this movie for anyone that loves music and is into based on true story movies.
142311339X|5.0|I loved this book.  I cannot wait for the next one to be released.  If you were a fan of the Percy Jackson series this is definately a must for your collection.

B003UTUQ3E|5.0|There are several reasons to pick this up if you're a Bowie fan. For starts, the remaster of \\"Station To Station\\" has never sounded better. The chugging train of the title track literally bursts from the speakers like it hasn't before. The drums are crisp and sharp. And Bowie himself was exploring funk and German rock with delightful results, just before taking up with Eno for the Berlin trilogy.<br /><br />The second and best reason is the Nassau Concert recorded on the tour and broadcast on King Biscuit. Bowie and his band are tight and the sound is impeccable. Guitarist Carlos Alomar in particular is riveting. Bowie is obviously enjoying the tour (even cracking up and blowing the intro on \\"Changes\\").<br /><br />The whole package comes with two cardboard slip sleeves (bleh) and a set of post cards. Cameron Crowe adds a good essay about the album's creation in the enclosed booklet. That's the sizzle. The steak remains the album itself. As a transition from Bowie's soulman \\"Young Americans\\" persona to the Cocaine Robotics of \\"Heroes,\\" \\"Station To Station\\" is a perfect bridge.
B000E41MRC|5.0|This is the one to get, not the older special edition, since it not just full screen and is touted as digitally remastered other than the other synapse release fro 2001.....<br />Well, after receiving it, indeed after watching it, it seems in fairly okay condition, but there are areas that show the age and damage to the original film, definitely not a \\"restored\\" version, and I believe when they use the word \\"remastered\\", they might mean the sound, which is of course good, they could have remastered that sound for sure to eliminate record hiss or scratches/etc, but that isn't perfect either.<br />The commentary by that doctor somebody, he referred to it being the year 2000, when this release was released as remastered in 2006, meaning the whole film is just a redub of the 2001 release, whether or not there is a difference between the two, I don't know, but I suspect that the early 2001 release if bought cheap is exactly the same, no difference whatever.  I kind of wish I would have bought a used copy that, since there were several under thirty dollars used, well under twenty used, actually at the time I decided to opt for this newer transfer and there weren't any cheap ones used, so I did pay a premium for this \\"remastered\\".<br />This film is very educational on the national socialist mindset, what attracted the populous, there was even a translation of that national socialist national anthem I would have never realized, extolling the fight against some sort of red front and reactionaries, whatever reactionaries were.  I sometimes wonder what kind of history there would have been if there hadn't been a communist takeover of russia, ole hitler and his cronies might have had to come up with something else to gripe about to come to power, and as it is, the film enlightened me on the commentary that Hitler has a purge of the SA leaders at the behest of big industry and the military, even the church believe it or not, cause they feared a communist like SA military organizaiton take over of the country which would have maybe left the big wigs in the military out of a job, and big industry maybe nationalized and took over, and one can only wonder what role the german church organizations were wanting, like maybe they also fostered alot of anti semitism, cause it seems the national socialist movement took alot of their orders from those controlling them, something I sometimes wonder happens all too much in this country.<br />I got this film to get to be able to quote from history, and it has done just that, I mean, I read books from time to time, but film is history too.  I am waiting on another Reifenstahl film, \\"Olympia\\", a european transfer from a company in Korea, hopefully it will be somewhat remastered other than what is available generally here in america.e over of the country which would have maybe left the big wigs in the military out of a job, and big industry maybe nationalized and took over, and one can only wonder what role the german church organizations were wanting, like maybe they also fostered alot of anti semitism, cause it seems the national socialist movement took alot of their orders from those controlling them, something I sometimes wonder happens all too much in this country.

B0049P0A0W|5.0|This song is the greatest thing created by an unknown artist. With a easy dance beats and hard hitting, dubstep inspired break beats, this album is the best thing Skrillex has ever written. My favorites of the all them are Kill Everyone, which is just sweet because of the lyrics, and Scary Monsters And Nice Sprite (Noisia Remix), which is crazier, phater, and harder than the original.  This is one of the best albums of 2010.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Just had to weigh in on the comments. Everyone always has something to complain about. Remember when the bare bones edition came out? Everyone whining about the lack of special features. Now you get three versions of this movie and full of special features...guess what? We are still not satisfied? What is up with you people? The three hour extended version is alone worth the double-dipping! Loved the new beginning on Earth (really gives us an insight to the attitude of our lead character) and all the other added scenes. Cannot wait to triple dip when the 3D version comes out, so I will have a reason to get a 3D TV! This week alone, several titles came out in 3D with 2D blu-rays included. I have already started my collection. It is a smart move for studios to release the two versions together instead of having us to re-buy the movie (which most aren't worth it...only Avatar's worth that) to get the newer format.<br />This three disc set of Avatar is a materpiece of a blu ray! It is sad to read all the people still holding onto DVD. DVD is a dying format people...blu ray is awesome when done right! There is so much detail you are missing on DVD. Let this Avatar box be a reason to jump on the blu-ray bandwagon, because movies like Avatar were meant for blu-ray!<br />You will never look at video the same again!!
B003VANOFY|4.0|Very happy with the G930 Gaming Headset. A real pleasure to listen to the controlled surround sound of this headset even compared to my external 5.1 system.  Games and movies sound great and makes using a headset a pleasure and not a hindrance.  I would have gave it 5 stars if I could figure out how to make the headset not take over the external speaker system and still have it plugged in to the USB for charging. There is probably a way but I haven't dug deep enough into it yet.
B000002OAZ|5.0|First off i love the song red rooster they did a great job on that song i also  like sittin on top of the world even though i like creams version better i also love that howlin wolf eric clapton steve winwood from traffic bill wyman and charlie watts from the rolling stones and ringo starr are on the album that makes this a super group album and what a great session from all the bands i love i appreciate these musicians and they really influence me i love that these musicians are also true to the blues and i love that this album is rare
B000JIHP88|3.0|This crib mobile definitely attracts our baby's attention and helps him relax and sleep often.   Pros:   - Decent value for the money.   - colorful and attractive  - Easy assembly and installation  Cons:   - Not loud enough in the rainforest mode  - All tunes are dull and sleep inducing. At least one of them could have been a bit peppy  - Requires 3 D Type batteries. That's way too much. (At least it hasn't required replacement so far)   - The lights are not visible unless the room is completely dark  - It will play for 18 minutes and then stop. It's neither continuous nor customizable  - Our baby stopped watching it after 2 months. May not be useful after 4 months     Given a choice, I'd give 3.5 stars. Sells at a premium because of the brand and new parents' anxiety.   Planning to sell it on amazon marketplace or ebay, since it was used only for 2 months
B00000AOUD|5.0|This album has a major impact and influence to me its that good its only 1 song two sides and this album and the musicians are very talented i would put this album being my third best album of all time listen to this album through headphones to hear everything i rate this masterpiece 101 stars
B000001FYL|5.0|The timeless writing of Brother John Bongiovi combined with symphonic overtunes of the wild west . . . A real, melodic, shoot-from-the-hip encapsulation of one man's struggle to survive in a world that is cold and unforgiving.
B002KSPKRS|5.0|I purchased this with a little bit of trepidation having never had gaming headphones before.... I haven't been disappointed.  It has been easy to set up with the new xbox 360 and everything has worked as promised.  What has been the highlight and in fact a revelation is the surround sound...just superb.  It makes you feel much closer to the action and immersed in the game.  Based on 4 weeks with this product I would certainly recommend it highly.
B0041CGP02|5.0|Should rapidly acheive the highest sales for any \\"Greatest Hits\\" compilation assembled of any band, any genre. BON JOVI is nothing less than the world's greatest rock band and will never be surpassed.    ~BL~*
B003VSVWA0|5.0|I am an admirer of Leonard Cohen and have purchased some of his CD's before, however, \\"Songs from the Road\\" CD/DVD is absolutely the best of them. Every song is to perfection and \\"Bird from a Wire's\\" instrumental  background and solo is the best I have heard. What an inspiration from this man whose soul is so open and expressive. Wonderful!!
0316098337|2.0|I was really looking forward to reading this critically acclaimed book. What an interesting premise... the story of a mother and her child trapped, then escaping from, years of forced imprisonment in a small room. Even more fascintating is the fact that the sole narrator of the story is a 5 year old boy. According to  critics, the author's depiction of the story as experienced through the eyes and mind of a young child was pitch-perfect -- a rare feat, indeed!    The problem is, have you ever been regaled with the endless musings of a small child? Frankly, it's cute for about 5 minutes, then it becomes tedious.  Such was the case in Room, especially in the first third of the book.  After a couple of chapters of living day to day life in this claustrophobic prison from Jack's perspective -- eating with the meltedy spoon, having some (the left one, creamy, yum!), doing phys ed, and watching Dora, I was ready to move on and see some action, but the repetitive days went on and on for chapters.      Then Ma hatches her escape plan and I was, for a time, riveted.  At this point in the book, the plot turns and Jack's POV melded beautifully.  After the rescue, however, Jack's perspective began to morph into that of a baby-talking philospher and poet; the astute musings and the complex metaphors were beyond that of even a highly intellgent child.  Plus, after a short period of being confused and unable to comprehend the outside world, he seemed to adapt all too easily, especially when he was separated from Ma for the first time ever and left in the unempathic hands of his grandmother.  I agree with many other reviewers that the book flagged and fizzled after the rescue. Because we were still stuck with only Jack's perspective, there was little insight into Ma's experiences and choices.  While her subtle heroism and dedication to Jack were apparent while they were trapped in the room, once they were free, she became a somewhat boring enigma. Why she did what she did (I won'tspoil any plot turns here) was left unexplained; her own trauma was not dealt with clearly.      Is the enthralling experience of the escape and rescue that occurs over a few chapters worth reading the entire book?  I am not sure.  I have to admit that I stayed up way past my bedtime reading that through that section.  But what leads up to and follows this section is disappointing.
0553386816|4.0|I equate it to a hillbilly version of Canterbury Tales.  Good read - easy read.  I definitely recommend it.
B00000612P|5.0|Don't ask me why I remember this, but I recall some critic back in the day describing the music of  Rod Stewart by citing two \\"untranslatable\\" terms from other languages.  One was the Spanish \\"macho,\\" which has longsince become part of our own language and probably needs no further commentary--except maybe to note that, in Stewart's case, the machismo (if that's what it is) is certainly an ironic and self-effacing brand of same.  The other term the reviewer mentioned was the German word \\"gemuetlich\\" (or maybe it was the noun form, \\"Gemuetlichkeit,\\" hard to say).  I was only beginning my study of German at the time and I remember being delighted to see a German \\"concept\\" somehow linked to good ol' rock'n'roll, but if my knowledge of the language had been better then, I might have questioned the use of the term (roughly translatable as \\"cozy\\" or \\"comfy\\" or BOTH)to describe MUSIC or (even more specious) the person MAKING the music.    But then again...music is all about \\"atmosphere,\\" and at its best, it carves a psychically habitable \\"space\\" out of sound, so maybe \\"gemuetlich\\" isn't such an inapt term after all.  If the soundscape created here were literal space, well, hey, I'd consider renting a room in it.  It really would be as comfy cozy and downright \\"gemuetlich\\" an abode as you could ever hope for really.      EVERY PICTURE TELLS A STORY may be THE textbook example of how a collection of an almost ragtag mix of greater and lesser tracks coming together to form a perfect whole.  Yes, \\"Maggie May\\" is the centerpiece, with \\"Mandolin Wind\\" and the title track right up there as the tunes fans remember whistfully (and/or still play obsessively) some forty years on.  But they fit better here than on any of the subsequent \\"best of\\" repackagings that have cropped up over the years.  There is an overarching SOUND to the entire album--and it really IS an album in the old sense of the word--that's compelling in an uniquely ambling shambling kind of way.  The band sounds likea bunch of merry pranksters with no qualms about cribbing from every conceivable genre and succeed in coming up with something new  and yet very familiar.  They make it look and sound easy, but you know it's not.    You can't really say that every track was actually inspired.  Stewart and Co. admittedly put their own distinctive mark on a classic bit of Americana like \\"That's All Right, Mama\\" or a Motown staple like \\"(I Know) I'm Losing You,\\"  but the former still sounds like a bit of a throwaway and the the latter more like a \\"something/anything\\" excuse to rock out a bit on an otherwise low key album.  But so what?  In the larger context, they work pretty well and achieve a flow that may well be a kind of happy accident, ultimately, but it's there. It all really does all hang together.      Probably, the only track I really take issue with to this day is the snippet of \\"Amazing Grace\\" that serves as a kind of interlude between \\"That's All Right, Mama\\" and Rod's take on the early Dylan tune \\"Tomorrow's A Long Time.\\"  I mean, why bother?  I want to hear the whole song or nothing at all.  Sounds to me like he's just getting warmed up and it's over.  Not a song you want to goof around with.  Such interludes became something of hallmark of Rod Stewart albums in the 70s, by the way, with the little Baroque intro to \\"Maggie Mae\\" (NOT included on the single) as another--more successful--example.    I did a little Googling around to see if I couldn't actually locate the \\"macho/gemuetlich\\" review somewhere online.  I had thought it might be on the Rolling Stone site, but no.  There were a number of gushing reviews of all of Rod the Mod's early albums (before the great fall from grace of the disco era Rod) by critics whose names I remember from my misspent youth reading rock rags.  What a hoot to read the raves from writers like John Mendelsohn, Langdon Winner (GREAT name) and Greil Marcus.  Expectations were sure high back then--with Mendelsohn writing, for instance, that Rod Stewart was \\"capable of saving souls.\\"  That genteman  must have chafed mightily six or eight years later when confronted with the likes of \\"Da Ya Think I'm Sexy.\\"  Moreover, for good or ill, I don't think that either contemporary critics OR fans think in such ultimate terms nowadays.     Maybe we should.  Or at least, we should maybe be trying to get a little more of that Gemuetlichkeit thing going on.
B002ZG98Z0|5.0|I loved the series and was so glad it continued into a movie and now the sequel.  I really enjoyed seeing the girls again but I have to say that it should end here.  The characters have done as much as they can do and now we have great memories stemming back to 1998 when it all began. If you're a fan of any of these women or the series,  I highly recommend this movie!

B0017HMF6W|5.0|The blu-ray copy of North By Northwest allows us to view this movie in a manner that we might never have been able to before.  The print is beyond compare and the work performed in transferring this to blu-ray format is a true work of art. The scenery just comes to life and the imagery is so vivid and the colors, etc. are like nothing i've seen before while watching this film.  Kudos to all who brought us this anniversary edition.  A most welcome addition to my collection.
B0041CGP02|5.0|i love this album! The 4 new songs are great, they have all the great hits in one album! Cant please every fan, but its totally worth the price!<br />Very happy with it :)
B0031RAOVY|5.0|a must hve movie for dog lovers .  it arrived very fast and in perfect conditions.  a good store to buy dvd´s
B00377V6J2|5.0|The assumption here is that together these make one complete show.  You can never be sure since they released the CD with songs that are not on the DVD and vice-versa.  Why do they do this?  It would be nice to view the entire show on one DVD.  Instead what you get is a partial DVD to what was really played. If I rated this package based on this it would be one star.  However they are great and it's better to have this than not have it at all.
B003ZHQVJO|5.0|This album got the reviews i expected no better than 3 stars.Just like Kiss They can have a good album but theres such a strong opinion you get the bashers out there that trash them!If you like rap u wont like this.Thank god kid rock has gotten over that!He used that w his personality to make a name for himself but fortunately now hes back to his rock roots!Rap requires NO musical talent and only appeals to people who can relate to the lyrics(black people  livin hard times and as much as i despise the music i understand the  rawness and honesty of it)and ignorant white people who are ignorant musically!Thank god hes matured and grown up!My only small complaint is y waste Bob Seger on piano?Is he such a great pianist that anyone can tell?His voice wouldve been better seved on here than the overrated Cheryl Crow but thats nitpicking!White people who rap are a joke!listen to the album and hes talkin about Detroit and where hes from an no place represents the countrys hard times better than Detroit.Hes doesnt need to pander to the rap fans to do that!Hopefully talented artists like him will kill this rap popularity once and for all!Its all commercial crap anyway!You want real black music listen to old blues and if you want talent listen to Stevie Wonder and people w talent not the garbgage thats out there now riding the popularity wave!Buy this album NOW!!!!!!!!!!!
0061537969|4.0|The Art of Racing in the Rain pulls you into a believable and engaging world right from the first page, and that's no easy feat given the story is told from the perspective of a dog. Granted, he's a very smart dog.<br /><br />Enzo, the dog, and his master, Denny, are both car racing enthusiasts. Enzo acquired his own appreciation of the sport from listening to Denny and from the countless hours of TV watching he's grown accustomed to. When tragedy after life tragedy befalls Denny's world, he must find within himself the courage to keep fighting for the values that have shaped his life. Enzo can't help his master much as a dog, or maybe he can more than either of them realize.<br /><br />The custody battle in the latter half of the book showcases an exceptionally dark side of humanity that almost derails the story's believability. Almost, but not quite. Denny and Enzo's relationship and the spot-on racing metaphors sprinkled throughout make this a worthwhile read.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I recieved Nora Jones new cd Featuring and was pleasantly suprised.  The album has quite an ecletic range of songs.  From country duets with Willie Nelson and Dolly Parton, songs with the wonderful ray charles, to the fu fighters and outcast to name a few.  There is something for everyone blues, country, pop to rap.  It was an amazing album.  I am looking forward to trying Norah's other cds.
B003FSTN6Q|3.0|The final installment.  Well what can I say...but I`m a little disapointed.  Here`s why;  I was expecting hewitt and friends to go all out this season but I do not think they did so. They did not give the ansers to the big questions and the final episode was mid range.    Don`t get me wrong, I`m glad I`ve seen the fifth season but I was expecting more.  If you are a fan then I recomend you see it but, keep an open mind.
B0041YI4ZO|1.0|This is a cheap bootleg. The video looks like it came from an internet download. Avoid at all costs... The movie itself is good. Its not like the first two IP MAN movies with Donnie Yen, but the story is essential for people interested in Ip's life
B003L77GGK|4.0|So verry close indeed.  I`m a major fan of the boys and I expected so mutch from this season.  The season was verry good and awsome, but they let me down when it came to Lucifer.  Being a Satan worshiper myself, I was expecting more from him. And by that I mean more power on display and alot creepier. He is the coolest gye ever after all.  They did not do him justice.  Beside that, a verry cool season.
B004132I4S|5.0|While not usual Sufjan fare, this is far and above my expectations. Having missed the NPR preview and I blindly ordered it, because really, it's Sufjan Stevens... it can't be THAT wrong. And oh how it wasn't. This tight album is packed with all the fantastic vocals, engaging instrumentation and lyric meals that fans have come to expect from him. If this is your first look at Sufjan or if it is your latest aquisition I most heartily reccomend it.

B002E01LL6|4.0|This movie's story is a little confusing at first, but as you watch it through you will be like oh...so thats why hes fighting. I have to note out of nowhere Harvey says \\"Do you like to fight?\\" Ok just a little bit like other people say this movie's title seems like it replaced another one. In the story with the character Zulay, Shawn apparently kept his head that direction until he finds out a little secret. I really thought he would see her again. The unrated version now only adds an extra 3 minutes to the movie. I didn't see much new things to it. Instead I thought it should be called the extended version not unrated. There were 5 fights including the little intro. Like I said there could be more fighting to earn that title. Now let me say the acting is great. I really like Terrence Howard being in the film. He plays a great role as a scam artist. Channing and Zulay also have good roles. The comedy mostly came from some of Harvey's friends and Zulay's mom, or grandma I think it is. The soundtrack also kept me interested into it and even though I have a weird feeling like something is missing I really do think its an awesome movie. It kinda reminds of movies like 8 mile, you got serve, and stomp the yard (I really don't know why). There should be a sequel and with more fighting.
B003ZJ0ZX0|4.0|Let me first start by saying that I've never heard of this man before until I heard, \\"Just the Way You are\\" from my sister's playlist and I was surprised to hear his voice. He could actually SING. Then I heard \\"Grenade\\" on the radio and he completely sold me. I bought the CD and was not disappointed at all. He definitely has talent, his voice, his music variety, and best of all his lyrics! He reminds me a lot of Ne-yo in a good way.     What I was disappointed by was, not all of the tracks that he did were not put on this album. I actually looked them up and here they are if anyone is interested: Who Is, Dream Taker, Dance In The Mirror (AWESOME SONG), His version of Brandy's Long Distance which he wrote, Today My life begins, Her World Goes On, and Move On.     My favorite tracks are: Grenade, Just The Way You Are, Talking to the Moon, Count On Me and The Lazy Song.    Cant wait to see what he puts out next!
B0040JHXTI|5.0|In this review, I'll cover just the remastered original Darkness On The Edge of Town album itself.  Other reviewers have covered the extra content.  Also, this isn't an \\"album review\\".  I'll assume that if you are considering dropping $80+ on this set, you know this is a classic.<br /><br />The overall sound quality is significantly improved by this remaster.  Recall that the original CD issue of Darkness really was just a transfer of the original master to CD format.  No \\"re\\" mastering was done at the time.  As a result, the original CD lacked low end definition, suffered greatly from audible tape hiss, and was generally \\"muddy\\".<br /><br />All of those issues have been resolved in this excellent remaster.  You notice from the opening drum fill of \\"Badlands\\" that the low end now is much tighter and well-defined.  Gary Tallent's bass lines can now be felt as much as heard, which is how good rock bass should be.<br /><br />Tape hiss is now reduced significantly; you'll notice this especially on the intros to \\"Something in the Night\\" and \\"Racing In The Street\\".  Tape hiss is still present on those tracks, so don't expect it to disappear completely, but it is much less distracting.<br /><br />One improvement I didn't expect was the increased presence and clarity of the electric guitars.  While Bruce's guitar parts were prominent in the original release, they now have greater presence and a little more \\"bite\\", meaning high frequency volume.  But even more importantly, Steve Van Zandt's guitar work has gone from almost inaudible in the original release to very easy to hear in the remaster.  This is most noticeable on \\"Adam Raised A Cain\\".  If you have the [[ASIN:B000002AJO Live: 1975-85 (3CD)]] album, you know that Steve's guitar work is very prominent, especially on the pre-chorus (\\"Daddy worked his whole life for nothin' but the pain. . \\").  As it turns out, this guitar part was present all along on the studio version of \\"Adam\\"; it just needed a thorough cleaning in order to be heard (and appreciated).  If you are a guitar geek like me, the remaster makes it very easy to hear which channel contains Bruce's [[ASIN:B000GAP09K 50s Esquire Electric Guitar]] and which is Steve's [[ASIN:B00186DK48 Fender American Standard Stratocaster Electric Guitar, 3-Tone Sunburst Rosewood Fretboard]].<br /><br />All in all, an excellent job was done with the remaster.  Will you be able to tell the difference?  A good yardstick might be comparing this to the [[ASIN:B000BJS4OY Born To Run: 30th Anniversary 3-Disc Set (CD/2DVD)]] remaster issued a few years ago.  If you picked that up and appreciated the improvements, then you will certainly enjoy the Darkness remaster.  If you couldn't tell the difference, then you won't want to spend $80+ on this set just for the improvements in audio fidelity.).

B0044XV3QY|4.0|This movie is great.  I loved the extra content in this edition.  It is loaded with features.  The one I find most useful is the family audio track.  The case looks great.  It all comes together very nicely.  The only complaint with the case is the actual disc holders.  They are made of cardboard sleeves.<br /><br />The movie was made in 3D. I think a 'collectors edition' should include it regardless of the current number of 3D TV sets.  Regardless if you own a 3D TV or not. That's why I dropped it 1 star.  I think if the next 'edition' includes it this one may not be needed.
B000YABYLA|1.0|Unbearable! Juno is a smart-alecky little brat. After 15 minutes I stopped the movie, put the dvd back into it's case, and returned it to the library.  I would have been really mad if I had bought it. Worst movie ever.
B000W4D94I|5.0|I am happy to report this is a great version of one of my favorite movies.  Plenty of extras and great quality overall!
B0043ZDU1E|5.0|loreena touches the soul. her voice takes music to the level of art as no other in the business can. this, i think, is because to her music is art and business is a byproduct. do not disect or analize what you are hearing, just listen and let it take you. the celtic roots run deep, as does the artistry. one of loreenas' strong points is that she surrounds herself with some of the best musicians in the business. brian hughes, hugh marsh, caroline lavelle et all are specatular. this recording is a most welcome addition to the soundtrack of my life and will add a richness and beauty to yours as well. listen, absorbe, enjoy!
1416583432|4.0|People that love dogs think of them as four legged people. We talk to them and they, in essence, communicate in return. They understand us and we understand them. This book allows the reader to get closer to understanding the way dogs communicate to us. We can gain a better understanding and insight as to why a dog does what it does. And more importantly, we can learn how to make our special friends and companions happier. After reading this, when you take your dog on a \\"smell walk\\", you will understand how very important this is to the dog.
0783240236|5.0|\\"The Birds\\" is a movie that seems to have really stood the test of time. Even though this film has no background music at all it is a definitive masterpiece from the Master of Suspense, Alfred Hitchcock.    Blonde beauty 'Tippi' Hedren makes her movie debut playing the sassy Melanie Daniels. The movie begins with Melanie shopping at a pet store in San Francisco. Right as she enters the store Alfred Hitchcock has a brief cameo walking out of the store with his dogs. Melanie is later abruptly attacked by a sea gull after she has driven to Bodega Bay. The dialogue between Melanie and a lawyer, Mitch Brenner (played by Rod Taylor), his younger sister Catherine (Veronica Cartwright) and Jessica Tandy (who is Mitch and Catherine's mother in the film) was well written and occasionally humorous.    A relationship slowly develops between Melanie and Mitch, but is interrupted by a bird attack at Catherine's birthday party. The attacks escalate as the birds inexplicably wreak havoc. Melanie is badly wounded from a violent attack near the end of the film, as it slowly leads up to an unforgettable closing scene.    In summary, this is an excellent movie. Even the special effects are good, considering this was made long before digital technology/CGI was possible. Highly recommended!
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I have long been in love with the vocal stylings of Norah Jones.  When I got this album, I was so excited.  I was expecting songs I already knew with people doing duets with her.  I was pleasantly surprised however to find that most of the songs I didn't know.  I was able to get to know some new artists as well.    I am not a fan of rap music, so there are 3 songs on the album I don't love.  But, with 18 songs, I don't feel like I am cheated out at all and I will just remove those 3 from my playlist.    This is a definite must have for anyone who likes Norah Jones.  Great Holiday gift!!!
B0040JHWKS|5.0|It is well known that during one of the early springsteen performances viewed by jon landau, he proclaimed springsteen the future of rock and roll.  This was a much more prophetic and sensible prediction than the \\"new dylan\\" tag that was also bandied around.   It is indisputable that springsteen delivered and continues to deliver some of the most prolific music by any one artist.  I differ from some critics who submit that the older albums were that much better than his more recent cd's.  What does confirm spingsteen's place in the history of music as an all time pillar of rock(as if he required any confirmation),(similar to neil young and his bobness),is an album such as this.  An album of old material that was not originally released,but not because it lacked quality.  This is already referred to as the masterpiece  that could fit comfortably bewteen born to run and darkness on the edge of town.  The songs here are not merely remastered versions of the songs on darkness on the edge of town.  The songs on the \\"lost album\\" part although some may be familiar(\\"fire\\" etc),are a true testament of what honest music should sound like,music, although a few decades old, that belie its age.  This is not a throw away album.  This is the sound of rock then and now.  Long may it run.
B0036EH3WU|5.0|My wife and I came to LOST only after the 6 seasons had already aired. I had assumed for years that it would be a long Survivor episode - only fake. I was wrong. It is certainly one of the best television series ever. You care about the characters and believe everything that happens because they believe it. The series stumbles in the 4th season, but the characters also stumble. A few characters can be annoying and whiny, but most of those get what they deserve sooner than later. Over 6 seasons long term characters actually develop and learn life lessons. The imagination level is a ten out of ten. We actually bought the complete series because after watching the whole shebang on Netflix, we wanted to watch it all over again. I own very few DVDS. I only buy things worth rewatching more than twice - The Sixth Sense, The Matrix, A History Of Violence, Memento, Stop Making Sense, ... LOST is such a thing.
B003TXSF5C|2.0|A startling subject poorly handled. The writing style is so off-hand it reads like it was written by someone in a hurry. It and Professor Hawkin deserve better treatment than this.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|I have always been a huge kid rock supporter i have all his cds seen him in concert a few times and was always blown away. (till now) I could not wait for this cd to drop after i herd born free and boy was i dissapointed. He went from kid rock to oldman country. If you can keep your eyes open long enough to hear the whole thing you will realize that this guy has lost everything he ever had. This isn't even a good country cd. Don't pay $10 for a drink coaster born free is the only decent song on here and you've already heard it a thousand times. Even the songs with the word rock in the title don't rock Jason Aldean and Zac Brown rock harder than this has been.
B0006J28MI|5.0|This was a great movie to sit and watch with the kids.  It had comedy, action and a few life lessons.
B000HEWEJO|5.0|This is what the Christmas Holiday should be about. I watch it every year to remind myself that it is the time of year we should celabrate Christian values, family and friends, and not the almighty dollar. If Christmas is all about spending money in the mall, why do so many of the Holiday shoppers look angry and sad? Get this movie, make some coco and snuggle up with your family to watch and learn.
0812973992|4.0|Several short stories are set against the backdrop of Philipe Petite, the man who did a tightrope walk between the World Trade Center Towers.  The protagonists of McCann's stories seemed to teeter totter and mostly fall, as Petite gracefully accomplished his mission.<br />McCann is a skillful writer who makes you care deeply about people who live on the fringes of society.  However, I would have preferred less vignettes and more depth.
B000U0F7RG|5.0|Great collection, I love Gilmore Girls. Had never seen the series when it was on air, borrowed the first few seasons and became hooked.  Packaging and discs in a cute little case.  Nice space saver for anyone interested in owning the series.
B0043URV8M|2.0|Let me first say that I actually like Alexandre Desplat as a composer.  I really enjoyed his work on \\"Twilight Saga:  New Moon\\".  That score contained some wonderful themes.  So when I learned he would compose the score for \\"Harry Potter & Deathly Hallows Part One\\", I was immediately excited.  Unfortunately, after listening to the score, my excitement has turned to disappointment.  Unlike \\"New Moon\\" which opens with a hauntingly beautiful full theme and contains several well-constructed pieces of music such as \\"Bella Dreams\\" and \\"Dreamcatcher\\"; \\"HP Deathly Hallows\\" for the most parts is atmospheric music without strong identifiable themes.  The album opens with \\"Obliviate\\" which abandons the tradition of the opening \\"Hedwig's Theme\\" and provides us some moody music that never really goes anywhere.  \\"Sky Battle\\" is somewhat exciting.  The piano work in \\"Harry and Ginny\\" is nice but the track feels as if it was cut short without a satisfying ending.  \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\" starts out promising with nice keyboard work but doesn't develop into much.  The music peters out with an anticlimactic \\"The Elder Wand\\" and there are no end credits.  Overall I feel that the album fails to establish its own identity.  Most of the tracks are about two minutes or less and you feel as if you are listening to fragments of music that never really have time to develop.  The music may work well in the background of the film but without any full themes, concert pieces or memorable tracks; the listening experience on CD leaves something to be desired.
B002ZCY7TG|5.0|From season One to the last season Eight I loved it so very much. This is the best character developed TV series ever in every season, Alias,CSI,MI-5, none of it did what 24 brought us with their characters. I salute them for that.  It is so sad that FOX decided to stop it. I have all the seasons and looks like I will have to get the Blu-ray version too and hoping I could  post the DVD's on Amazon. Thank you K.Sutherland for the unforgettable 24.
B001OQCV2O|1.0|\\"Oh my goodness were headed to Africa...hmmmm I always wanted to go to Africa.

B003ZVJFFM|5.0|First of all this review is for the 2 disc Blu-ray/DVD release. I saw this first in theaters, I was amazed at not only the story and digital effect, but the 3D. Disney's A Christmas Carol is by far has the best 3D effects I ever have seen. I wondered if the thrill would transfer to 2D. It did, although there is certain scenes that look a bit off obviously added just for the 3D effect. I was supprised at the bonus features. They were about all a fan of this film could expect or want they follow:  Picture in Picture: by far the best special feature on the disc. It shows the actors as they filmed the movie, black dot's and all.    Commentary:         This is meant to go along with the PIP, but it is optional. Zemeckis' commentary is a little borning but still worth the lisen.    Countdown to Christmas:A frustrating advent calender.    Capturing Dickens:  A short documenty(hosted by a VERY annoying woman) it's informative but a little too short.    On set with Sammi: a featurette were one of the cast members tell us about motion capture    Deleted Scenes: Deleted scenes obviously. They are good and a little fun to watch    Overall I would say that the special features are rather good. The only bad thing I can say is they obsess over Motion Capture too much(We get it's Motion Capture Robert)    Good Movie, although I would think twice before letting little children view it,It's probably the scariest version of A Christmas Carol ever filmed.
B0015D3YX6|4.0|Puede resultar un t&oacute;pico, pero este disco SI es un cl&aacute;sico. Se ha escrito mucho sobre Love, sobre Arthur Lee, sobre las circunstancias que rodearon la grabaci&oacute;n, las comparaciones con los Doors, etc. S&oacute;lo voy a a&ntilde;adir que esta edicci&oacute;n SI es de lujo. Contiene en el primer cd el disco remaesterizado, buen sonido, y en el segundo otra mezcla del disco y esos temas recuperados de maquetas, singles, etc. Buen documento sonoro. En ocasiones, ciertas edicciones supuestamente \\"de lujo\\" contienen un cd con un sonido muy similar al de la serie media y el segundo cd es un concierto o cualquier grabaci&oacute;n que lleva navegando meses por la red. En este caso, afortunadamente, no es as&iacute;. Como en el BOX SET de The Doors, el libreto tambi&eacute;n merece la pena.
B0010X8NF0|5.0|While this got very mixed reviews from the critical establishment, I found I really enjoyed it.  Wes Anderson's style is consistent with his earlier films;  the same great use of pop music, great tracking shots, low key, oddball humor and  detailed performances.  But here, in the story of three brothers trying to re-connect on a trip to India, there's once again a human, emotional core under the absurdity.  Not perfect, but better than 98% of what's getting made.<br /><br />The Criterion Blu-Ray is really gorgeous, but I gotta say the regular DVD, non-Criterion release still has quite a nice image.  Go for the Criterion if you can, but if cost is a big factor better to get the plain old DVD than not get the film at all.
0767903862|4.0|Bill Bryson combines the perfect quantities of curiosity, self-enrichment, cynicism, humor and personal vice to his written journeys. Good travel writing needs to be cynical - drowned by tourists, fearful of environmental extremes, surprised at the coldness of hotel clerks - but it also needs to be curious and open-minded. Bryson, compared to someone like Paul Theroux, is a very intelligent man who is also a genuinely good person. He is no misanthrope led from one sight to the next exhausted by human encounters. Bryson makes you genuinely interested in the places, people, and circumstances that shape his narrative.<br /><br />This is a really, really good travelogue. I have traveled to Australia before (only Brisbane, though) and wasn't too taken with it. But after reading this book, I'd love to trace his footsteps up and down, over and across, within and without. The Great Barrier Reef, Uluru, the Great Southern Rail. All are described in vivid detail, with the journey itself taking center stage. Bryson describes a landscape defined by wonder and obscurity. A vast, sprawling emptiness waiting to be discovered. Of particular poignancy is his visit to the gurgling stromatolites in Western Australia which leaves the reader with a sense of Australia as an old, wise, and underestimated place.
B00003XACV|1.0|I am rather taken aback by the reams of positive reviews for what is very mediocre music. By all means, listen for yourself (indeed, I would say it's mandatory in this case), but this score sounds like something a musically competent 13 yr-old would have put together on discovering a glockenspiel in the house.    Uninspired, repetitive. Truly, there's little as subjective as personal musical taste...
B0044XV3R8|1.0|What genius at 20th Century Fox thought it was a good idea to have the first half of each version of the movie on disc 1 and continue the movie on disc 2?  It would have been nice to watch any of the newer versions WITHOUT having to insert another disc. Very poor planning on the part of someone at 20th Century Fox! oh, wait! A future box set will be released with each version on a separate disc.  Maybe it wasn't poor planning on the part of the studio.  I've already sold this version and hopefully someone will get it right the next time! Shame on you 20th Century Fox
B002VWNID6|1.0|We have enjoyed the movie for years on VHS. We received the first DVD and had a special night set up. It quit playing and went to the start up screen near the end of the movie. No way to FF or skip since it was in the last section. Amazon replaced it. The second one did the same thing at the exact spot. Amazon refunded our money this time. Very dissapointed!
B002N5N5QQ|5.0|This show is so awesome and powerful, my husband and I are glued to the tv every SOA show night. We've been big fans since season 1!! buy this dvd if you ever had a different opinion of outlaws and motorcycles. Kurt Sutter did an awesome job with his imagination on the tv show.
B0042JTDXK|3.0|IF:   It is the goal of a producer and record company to turn a profit.   A profit is generated by the acceptance of the general public by:   1) Purchasing the Music  2) Played air time    THEN:   The producer steers the \\"artist\\" in a direction the majority of fans approve.      My opinion-  Josh worked with a really talented Producer  David Foster, who  fit his genre & fans; then worked with a really talented Producer Rick Rubin, who didn't fit his genre or his fans.    It is not surprising to see  1-3 star reviews for this album.    We're answering the wrong questions.       It's not ....  DO WE LIKE JOSH?      More rather..... Do we like Rick Rubin's Josh OR David Foster's Josh?       My answer is both!    However, the real judge is the amount sold of his NEXT album.    BECAUSE the amount sold of this album is riding on the coat tail success of his last.

B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Well the way I see it Kid Rock owes me 15 dollars. I have always been a Kid Rock fan. On the later albums I always appreciated the way he managed to incorporate his more mature music with the music that has brought him all this way. Rock and Roll Jesus was a shining example of this, he has always had a way of making his whole fan base happy. Until now, this album has totally alienated every fan that enjoyed the rock side of Kid \\"Rock\\". I have always enjoyed country music but even trying to look at the country side of this album it is still not good. I remember very vividly when Aerosmith released Just Push Play, I listened to and stopped at the next garbage can and threw it away. I will at least listen to the new Kid Rock a couple of times, but I am afraid it will face the same fate as the Aerosmith CD.     It sounds so great when artists say that they are maturing and its just a natural progression for the music to also mature, when really what this means is they want to make themselves available to a broader audience and make more money and country is definitely the hot ticket to do that right now, I understand and this and that's fine, he is in the business to make money, that is his job. This Album surely is not up to par with his latest releases. Okay the people that enjoy this album will probably say that the people who do not like this album are living in the past, and maybe we are, but all we really want are some songs on the albums that rock make you feel good and forget the problems of the day, by having these songs then at least we know that under the music corporations ruling hand Kid Rock can still manage to release some quality Rock And Roll.     Judging by the majority of the reviews I have already read here Kid Rock has definitely \\"flown his middle finger in the air\\" at the loyal fan base he once had and has embraced a whole new and hopefully profitable style of music. In the end as long as he and the music corporation are happy I guess that is all that really matters. Okay I feel better now and on to the next Kid Rock album hopefully he has gotten this out of his system.

B001PCOSVY|4.0|This is what many believe was the last true Metal outing for this Swedish outfit before they sold out to the MTV Glam image (that would also be the reasoning behind Norum's departure during their next album's World Tour). 'Wings Of Tommorrow' is pure unpolished Heavy Rock with the same production feel as their self-titled debut a year earlier. The writing ability of each track has matured & the musicianship seems alot tighter & cleaner too. Tempest had even admitted this is his favourite Europe album he's recorded, & it's not hard to hear his understanding from the opening track to the closer. For any fan of Euro/Swedish Metal, or just Europe in general, this album is a must have to your collection. The only reason for not gaining a 5 star rating, is the production sound just still isn't as top notch as future recordings to come.

B002WY65VU|5.0|Zombieland is right up there with \\"Return of the Living Dead\\" and \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" as one of the best zombie horror comedies ever. Tha actors Jesse Eisenberg, Woody Harrelson, Emma Stone, and Abigail Breslin all give great performances and have good chemistry with one another. The plotline is a simple zombie survival storyline(Using Eisenberg's character's zombie survival rules).<br />Columbus (Jesse Eisenberg) is a college loner that is trying to make it home across a zombie wasteland to his family in Columbus, Ohio.  On his way he hitches a ride with the fearless twinky loving character of Tallahassee (Woody Harrelson). While searching through a grocery store they encounter Witchita (Emma Stone) and Little Rock (Abigail Breslin), two sisters that trick them into handing over their guns and car keys. Columbus and Tallahassee end up finding another vehicle filled with guns and ammunition but are later once again tricked by the sisters. However this time they stay together and head towards their destination of Pacific Playland. The group later come across Bill Murray who makes a funny and memorable cameo appearance as himself.<br />This film does have some gore and violence but relatively minimal compared to other more hardcore zombie films. This movie is light-hearted in tone and will appeal to both horror and comedy fans alike. Zombieland is pretty much the American version of \\"Shaun of the Dead\\" and is very similar in overall feel with similar zombie comedy elements. This movie is highly recommended for any fans of horror films and is a must see and own for fans of zombie films and horror-comedies.
B004BRP7R4|5.0|This is a beautiful album altogether.  It's a different sound from Josh's last albums, but with the same amazing voice and music.  You will love it!  I fell in love all over again.
B004BC7MRM|2.0|Kid Rock is one of my favorite artist ever but I have to say this album is his worst.If you are looking for some classic Kid Rock don't buy this.I keep playing it over and over looking for something to stick but it just puts me to sleep.Don't get me wrong I love his other country style songs but these are bad.I was waiting so long for this what a disappointment.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|This amazing box set is worth it for the full live concert from Houston '78 alone...an absolutely amazing performance showing Bruce & The E Street Band at the height of their powers. Totally scorching. Add in the remastered original album, 2 CDs of unreleased material, the behind-the-scenes documentary, more live/rehearsal footage and the beautiful packaging giving a glimpse into Springsteen's songwriting notebooks and this is a BARGAIN at $80. An absolute must-have for any Springsteen fan.
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Been wanting the box set for some time now.  For $129.99, it's a no brainer.  Might have dropped the price because of iTunes availability of the Beatles catalog.
B004ASVS0E|4.0|When I saw that Annie Lennox had come out with a (gulp!) Christmas album, and it was called \\"A Christmas Cornucopia,\\" my first reaction was . . . what?! Annie Lennox is one of my all-time favorite artists, and she takes her time between albums, to put it mildly, so why did this new collection have to be of Christmas songs?<br /><br />Three things that made me take the plunge and buy this album: 1.) Annie Lennox was born on Christmas. If that isn't a great excuse for gravitating towards a Christmas album, I don't know what is. 2.) Last year, Tori Amos came out with a brilliant holiday/winter season cd. So it is possible that this could be good. And 3.) It's Annie Lennox! I couldn't resist.<br /><br />Well, Annie Lennox is a legend for a reason. She overcame my skepticism and put out a really fantastic collection of songs. However, I must say I don't like her use of auto-tune on God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen one bit. It's a terrible nod to the current horrible trend and detracts greatly from the other outstanding vocal performances she delivers, both as the lead vocalist and as her own choir of backing vocals.<br /><br />The production and arrangements on the album are excellent, and Lennox sounds as good as ever. Of course, it's an album that will only get listened to during the holiday season, but that time comes around every year, and this is better than any of the drivel you hear in department stores and supermarkets in November and December.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|I waited for this set all year.  I have a 60\\" Sony 1080P HDTV and PS3 BluRay player, but no 3D capability.  So, this was the version I have been waiting for.  I had the wisdom and patience to NOT buy the earlier versions, knowing this version would come out at some time.  I am very happy with this set.    For those of you that bought the DVD version and found that the movie is split over two disc, realize there is only so much capacity on the DVD format.  With this being a 3 hour move with multiple versions and awesome video/sound quality, it was necessary to use two discs for the DVD version.    Know that the BluRay version does not have to make this sacrifice and all three versions of Avatar are on 1 disc.  BluRay has much more storage capacity than DVD.  So, there is your reason to upgrade to BluRay!
B000JRYOPG|5.0|Great movie!!! I can not complain. I was very suprise with Kymani Marley and Spragga Benz. The both did a great job working together.
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I will leave it to others to heap glowing praise on the documentary footage, remixed original, and out-of-the vault selections.  I have no further superlatives to add.  But, yes, they are all correct.    What blew me away was the reproduction of Bruce's notebook.  In these days of easy and undeserved celebrity, it is indeed something to be reminded of the joys of human achievement earned through honest, passionate, and dedicated labor. Leafing through the density of materials in this one composition book, I was mesmerized by this oddly intimate glimpse into his creative process.  How affirming and uplifting to be reminded of the value of that which is justly earned.  Gives you back a little faith in a world gone cold.
B004BRP7R4|2.0|when artists leave the producers that get them where they are. i was listening to this and its sounded so cheesy, alternating between christian-folk music and showtunes, bad ones at that. i get that he is trying to grow as a songwriter, but you can't ask fans to support something that is so different from what they've come to expect. a concert with these songs as the \\"meat\\" of the show will be as about as exciting as watching moss grow. awake was different to a degree from his previous albums, yet it was still an excellent collection of music. this is just yuck. i was looking forward to this and was seriously disappointed.
B00005JL0I|5.0|Casino Royale, (the remake) does not and cannot match the old original in my opinion.  I will still keep it and enjoy it along with my copy of the original.  But only because its BOND !  Alan .........
0887431461|5.0|My daughter just thrived on this book.  She was so driven to finish each page that she prefered to do it than anything else.  We had to pry her away from her to get her to eat.  I will take that.  I think it gave her a leg up in class as well.
B000UBMWG4|5.0|If you haven't seen this or have only seen the Hollywood version with the deadpan narration then you owe it to yourself to watch the Final Cut.    Acting, sound track, dialog, story line, sets, costumes, special effects, lighting, it's all here and all superbly done. The Final Cut is the film we all knew Blade Runner could be.    This edge of your seat gruesome look into free for all capitalism is more relevant than the day it was made. Can you say 'genetically modified organism'? Don't kid yourself the issues addressed in this film are real and becoming more urgent of attention every day.    After almost 30 years this movie looks as if it could have been made today. After nearly 20 years since seeing the directors cut and getting an idea of the potential in the film I expected it to come across as dated. But to my surprise and delight it holds up as well as it ever did. The final cut gets rid of all the annoying narration that ruined the original release and also gets rid of the typical 'boy get's girl they live happily ever after' ending that is so incongruous to rest of the movie. Finally you can see this the way it was meant to be seen.
B001C08RHA|5.0|I have not opened this movie yet because it is a christmas gift, (and it came in mail in excellent condtion) and I have not had any bad experiences with Amazon and the companies that ship me my purchases I've made, so I will recommend Amazon to everyone that is interested in saving a few dollars. Keep up the good work and thank you Amazon and the company that sent me my item.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've just recently become familiar with Josh's music, and I must say I absolutely love this album.  It is quite different from his other work, which I'm sure some people won't like, but I think it's incredible.  The lyrics are honest and Josh's voice is the best it's ever been.  \\"Hidden Away\\" and \\"Voce Existe Em Mim\\" are definitely the standouts of the album, but \\"Au Jardin Des Sans-Pourquoi\\" and \\"Love Only Knows\\" are currently my favorites.  Even if you haven't been a Josh Groban fan in the past, it's definitely worth a listen!
B003UYV08E|5.0|Ok what I mean by so far so good is I recieved the movie, and it came in excellent shape. I just have not opened it yet to watch it, because it is a christmas gift, but since I have had great experience with Amazon in the past, thats why I said that comment above, I will definetly recommend Amazon to everyone or anyone interested in saving a few bucks. I found my new shopping place! Thank you Amazon and the company that sent me the movie! I'm sure all will be fine and if not believe me you will hear back from me! lol
B00275EHJG|5.0|This was a great DVD, my son is only two and he doesn't seem to like it that much. My daughter does though, she's older. I think it's a good movie but not the best out of the Toy Story series.
B003UTUQ3E|5.0|Good reissue (i don't know why the '80's RCA cd version is 'trending' now, i hope it sounds better than the other '80's RCA CD reissues i have heard,  but this new analog remaster sounds perfect). And the 'bonus' two discs are the real reason to buy this. Fantastic show! I never heard this as a boot, and i really don't care for bootleg sound 'quality' anyway. This sounds great, and it's a great concert.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|I went into this album thinking I'd really like it. Love Kid Rock both his rock/rap and his country side but this album seems just a little weak. I bought Rock n Roll Jesus and listened to that non stop for a month even though there were a few songs on it that really didnt do it for me. As far as I can tell on \\"Born Free\\" is that there are maybe 3 songs that have replay value to me. Born Free, Flyin High and Care. I love Zach Brown and Flyin High is the best song on the album. There are a couple other tracks that are OK(God Bless Saturday, Rock Bottom Blues), but the rest is just forgettable. I know Rock is getting older and he doesnt want to scream his name the whole album, but this is a little too \\"easy listening\\" for me. I think his best overall album is \\"Cocky\\". Its a great mix of the slow and the fast. Got me over a nasty break-up. I guess alot of the songs on \\"Born Free\\" just dont talk to me as much. I'm a 33 year old guy whos slowing down myself so I thought I'd identify with it more thats all. Wish Amazon had a 3.5 star rating. Probably my least favorite album and I'm one of the biggest Kid Rock fans out there. Oh well, you cant hit a home run with everyone every time.
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|Fantastic and logical book. So much so interesting I read it in one stretch. It encouraged me to write my latest book \\" Self - A Delusion?\\" that I was contemplating writing for a long time - Shelton Ranasinghe
B0001MDQ6W|3.0|Too slick, too over-produced, not enough grit. This probably worked for the MTV crowd (displayed song titles? I'd be lost without them!), but fell way short of being a must-have for this Dylanphile.
B004AQR29C|5.0|I have watched and own seasons one through ten of Law and Order SVU and I was anxious to get No. 11 but why oh why is season 11 so expensive.<br /><br />I have purchased a lot of dvd's from China which are half the price of series one or the whole series (of many tv shows old and new) but there is no guarantee you're going to get good copies.  I take my chances because the prices at Amazon and other websites are outrageous.<br /><br />Please let me buy American and LOWER THE D..N PRICES~!!<br /><br />If I were to order all the new seasons of all the shows I have up to now it would cost me five times what it would cost elsewhere...SO GET THE MESSAGE--WE KNOW EACH DVD COSTS YOU ABOUT A PENNY--GET THESE PRICES LOWERED AND I'LL BE A HAPPY CUSTOMER--AND THAT STANDS FOR ALL THE LATEST SEASONS OF ALL THE SHOWS LIKE DEXTER, MEDIUM, ENTOURAGE, AND ETC.<br />A MOVIE-TV-ADDICT!<br />Sherrie H.
B001GCUO5W|5.0|after seeing previews for shutter island... i decided i would wait for the blu-ray... once i saw it, i definitely wished i would have seen it on the big screen... an AMAZING movie with AMAZING twists and turns... I have watched it 3 times and I still don't get it... is he crazy or not?  i personally dont think he is but each viewing still has me wondering...  picture quality is top notch... other reviewers said it wasn't very good but I thought it looked stunning... especially with how well it was shot...  this movie will mess with your mind and keep you up all night just thinking about what you just saw...  if watched in a group it will definitely spark debate... overall great movie, great picture, great acting, great shooting, just overall amazing.  a MUST-HAVE for any blu-ray collection!!!!
B00428ZRFY|4.0|Despite dropping an album around this time last year, Rihanna decided to release Loud as a balm to the many, many people who complained about Rated R's darkness (I think it's her best album; moody and sensual). Needless to say, this is a shiny and perky album, save her take of Love the Way You Lie (Part II), and largely succeeds in capturing the fun pop people loved in Good Girl Gone Bad. Unfortunately, unlike GGGB, Loud lacks a certain cohesiveness, a certain purpose. The songs are catchy and rock-solid, but feel, at the same time, like imitations of her previous monster hits. Plus, the album isn't Loud at all, comprising mostly of slinky electro-pop tunes, acoustic ballads, and reggae-inflected pop/r&b. However, Loud is extremely radio-friendly, which may be its saving grace.<br /><br />Top 5 tracks:<br /><br />1. Fading<br />2. S&M<br />3. Man Down<br />4. Only Girl (In the World)<br />5. Cheers (Drink to That)
B0043GAZYS|5.0|i really did not care to see this movie until a few friends went to see it and recommended it to me... so the other day i rented it VOD and to my surprise it was a very fun, visually pleasing movie.  so i bought it on blu-ray and it looks amazing! especially in the high-action scenes.  this is michael ceras best role to date... this is just a completely original movie that you can watch over and over and not get sick of.<br />picture quality: 4/5 - not the best ive seen but still VERY good<br />story: 5/5 - based off the comic books and still a completely badass story<br />acting:  4/5 - very good acting (for the most part)<br />blu-ray: 5/5 - comes with dvd and digital copy... just the one blu-ray disk is packed with extras!<br />overall: 5/5 - very pleased with my purchase! overall GREAT movie and GREAT blu-ray!
0714843377|5.0|The other day we were clearing out books to donate to the library and I found this book.   Though I worked in advertising a long time ago, this is one book that I think applies to ALL aspects of life.   Life should be according to YOUR design, life should be about thinking beyond the box,and this book helps remind you to do just that.   I think it would make a great graduation present, or as a gift to someone just starting out in a business of his/her own.   It's a book I'll never part with and find value in each time I read it.
B004BC7MRM|5.0|One thing a musician will always have is the saying you're damned if you do or you're damned if you don't, keep on the path and put out the same music and people will start to get bored and hate the music, however put out something different and it usually is a god damn you right off the bat as see in the other reviews. There's nothing wrong with what Kid did here, in fact he seems more in place with this type of sound, rather then the hit and miss of his past. The more boisterous and immature he'd get, the dumber the song would be, yet when he got down to business he would come off as a true musician rather then a cheep gimmick. This album is more down to earth and mature, it is a four to five start album.
B002VWNIAY|5.0|what is not to love - this is a classic   this is what is known as acting in the true sense
1599218011|5.0|Kris Carr is life changing. Her unbeatable attitude and wealth of knowledge combine perfectly in this masterful manifesto of wellness. Combining top-rate nutrition information from esteemed experts, guidance for every possible aspect of living well, and her signature sass, Carr has created a book that's as enjoyable and illuminating to read as it is inspiring. Even as someone who's been a healthy vegan for more than 10 years, reading this book made me evaluate my daily habits. It also made me want to get up early to start my day with a run and green juice rather than sleeping until the last possible second and slurping down coffee all day long. You can't help but want to try whatever she recommends, as she champions positive changes so effectively. This book should be required reading--for everyone.
B003YWUTJI|4.0|This album is quite different than I anticipated, but honestly, in a good way.  It's got a new flair about it that I really liked and I found it interesting to hear Norah sing with a variety of different artists.  It's not an album that I'll listen to day in and day out like some, but it's still a really good one that I don't mind adding into my music rotation.
B00386EZJU|5.0|This really is a fantastic soundtrack. My 2 1/2 year old is obsessed--he calls it his \\"Dragon Music.\\" He has a copy at home and at daycare. The daycare uses it for naps and with a 70 minute running time it works really well.
B003IB38UM|4.0|Excelente grabacion y buen video del viaje a Suiza, que antes solo tenia en version betamax, lo unico es la falta de incorporacion de las canciones \\"chiquitita\\" y \\"I have a dream\\" en español, buen folleto explicativo de las vivicitudes para grabar dicho disco. Son ediciones deluxe que han sacado con buena calidad en su presentacion y grabacion...... incorporacion de la cancion \\"summer noght city\\" version completa y \\"dream world\\"
B000AJIF4E|5.0|I am a musician and hobbyist audio dabbler. I used these for 4 years as a professional in the audio and video industry, and they are indeed the industry standard.<br /><br />They are very comfortable, sound good, and relatively durable. The price does not reflect the quality--I would easily pay $50-$100 more for the same headphones (but fortunately for me I don't have to!)<br /><br />I have had my personal pair for 4 year. They withstood 4 years of being shoved into my backback, only recently receiving a minor break in the left earphone bezel (was able to buy a replacement part from Sony)<br /><br />I had a more expensive ($160) pair from Sennheiser before these, and found them very uncomfortable. These were much better.
B002ZG993Q|5.0|The American' is a quietly powerful story and badly marketed by Focus Features. This is a slow burn character study that is ultimately very close to a remake of Jean-Pierre Melville's film 'Le Samourai'.    Director Anton Corbijn and scribe Rowan Joffe have taken Martin Booth's novel and crafted a real masterpiece here.  George Clooney gives a top 5 performance as an assassin with a moral crisis of sorts, and those who stick with this film are rewarded.     BUT: It's definitely not for everyone. Those who are game for it are likely to become big fans.  The film likely won't do much damage in the Oscar race, but that doesn't mean it isn't deserving of attention, because it definitely is. Jack (Clooney) is an assassin hiding out in a small Italian village.  While there, he's supposed to keep a low profile and just wait for his next assignment.  According to his boss (Johan Leysen) it's supposed to be simple, he'll just be making a custom rifle for another assassin (Thekla Reuten), not evening firing it.  His lack of connection to the world gets to him however, and he soon finds himself seeing a local prostitute (Violante Placido) and befriending the town's priest (Paolo Bonacelli).  Occasionally, someone will try to kill Jack, but that's almost beside the point in this film.  The focus is far more on the potential romance with the prostitute and the possibly redemption of Jack's soul.    George Clooney is excellent here, taking risks again as an actor and stripped of all of his charm.  He's rarely been better than he is here.  The film lives and dies by his performance, and he's more than up to the challenge.  The movie would suffer if a lesser actor was in the role.  He's supported by an almost exclusively foreign cast, and they accent Clooney well, while not stealing the spotlight.  Leysen is mostly seen talking to Clooney on the phone, but he's suitably menacing.  Reuten comes off as both sexy and deadly, which is essentially for her scenes with Clooney.  As for his two non-violent companions, his chemistry with Placido is very strong (and sexual...she's not afraid of nudity in the least), while it's more of a father-son thing with Bonacelli.  No one here is bad, but it's the Clooney show through and through in this flick. Corbijn is a visual stylist while not being flashy, in the vein of the directors of the 1970's.  Here he lingers on shots of Italy, making the village almost a character unto itself.  Some might fault his extraordinarily slow pacing, but I found it more deliberate than \\"slow\\", per say.  The script by Joffe is good, but wouldn't be what it is without Corbijn directing it and Clooney acting in it.  Of the three major players, Corbijn is most deserving of awards attention, but ironically is the least likely to receive it. On the Oscar front, the film is good enough to be mentioned in the Best Picture, Best Director, Best Actor, Best Adapted Screenplay, and Best Cinematography fronts, but if any will happen, it'll be Cinematography of Martin Ruhe getting recognized.  The flick is just too \\"indie\\" for a mainstream release (creating a lot of disgruntled viewers, like the one below) AND rated R for nudity, so it'll divide audiences and voters rather than uniting them.  That's not a recipe for success, but it takes nothing away from the quality of the movie. 'The American' is one of the better releases of 2010.  It won't satisfy those looking for a shoot-em-up, clean cut storytelling, or a neat denouement, but if you're in the mood for something different, this is a real treat.
B001DP7S7Y|5.0|Not sure what reviewer Jenkins is talking about.  My copy of this Blu Ray looks great, has English language menus and all the special features play just fine on my US PS3.
B0000261TE|5.0|Great tunes from a very accomplished musician.  Far from the days of being lead guitar with Journey, he has developed a style that shows his individual talent and leaves the listener wanting more.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|After reading the reviews where some were having issues with the disks, I went down to the bottom of the page and read the threads there.  Subsequently, I ordered this from Amazon UK at a savings of just over $30.00. Yes--$30.00.  It came in under 2 weeks and our newer Sony BDV has played them beautifully.  No region issues.  I have no idea why we are being ripped off here in the US and it makes me angry and sad.  Anyway---the Blue-Ray is worth it!
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|Let me start off by saying I am a HUGE Kid Rock fan, been a fan since MTV first aired his live performance on Spring Break show from FL in 2000 I think.    Anyway, I understand he is changing, I like that a bit, but there is little gut, or real feel to this cd. This is NOT a Kid Rock cd. He did not produce this recording. I feel that was a huge mistake. All the edge, gut, feeling, and real attitude is missing on this cd. Sounds weak, and sounds like he tried to hard to please everyone but himself. Sounds like a cd a record company wanted. That is NEVER a good thing.    Sorry Kid but I'll skip this tour!    Maybe cya in another four years....    TRUELY DISAPPOINTED ABOUT THIS RECORDING.
0316098337|5.0|Room is one of the most incredible books I have ever read... I could barely put it down. Every time I had to put it down for one reason or another, I could barely wait to pick it up and start reading it again. The story is amazing. I am viewing the world differently now, and I think that is what a good story does for us... causes us to change our perspective on life after allowing us to live inside the character's mind for awhile. The author's use of language and point of view as JACK is so descriptive and thorough that I felt as if I WERE Jack, I could see the Room around me and became part of his life. An incredible story... something I think everyone needs to read. You won't be the same after you finish this book.
B004222UC8|5.0|This is one of the most slept on metal albums ever. 1986 and 1987 were bad, bad years for Tony Iommi. No Ozzy? No Dio? No Geezer? No Ian Gillan? No problem. No combination of bad luck and bad business decisions could keep Iommi from coming up with the best riffs in the business. This album will not appeal much to people who only like the Ozzy years, but it will knock the socks off Sabbath fans and metal enthusiasts of every other variety. Don't overlook this one, it's not just for completists.
B00005JKG9|5.0|\\"Glendarry Glen Ross\\" movie is outstanding acting show which could probably be shown for acting students to learn the profession. It would probably go without notice but its acting made a difference. Al Pacino and Alec Baldwin lines are amazing to watch. They play so realistically. Not to mention other actors who are also great.  I watched this movie number of years ago but I am going to buy the dvd to own it and entertain myself from time to time.  I only had a hard time understanding the term which is revolving in the movie all the time. I am not sure if I am spelling it correctly. The characters talk about \\"leeds\\" or \\"weeds\\". Since English is not my native language I would appreciate if anyone could explain to me what it means? I could not find the right description in dictionary. It is the key word they are using in this movie. I would appreciate any explanantion from Amazon reviewers of this term. My email is: jarekmalinowski@hotmail.com  I highly recommend this movie for anyone who appreciates great acting.
B003DZX44I|5.0|I loved how you can play the movie many different ways. My favorite was the original with lyrics for each of the songs.My niece loves to try and sing with the the words.
B0042JTDXK|4.0|This is a rather great 'departure/explorative CD' release by the talented Josh Groban, titled \\"Illuminations\\". This great CD is produced by the legendary Rick Rubin (Neil Diamond, Metallica, etc) & mixed by Allen Sides & Scheps : perhaps an indication for the 'departure/exploration' in this new album. The album opens with a great instrumental, \\"The Wandering Kind(Prelude)\\" : great violin & guitar combination song. The next 3 tracks, \\"Bells Of New York City\\", \\"Galileo(Someone Like You)\\" & \\"L'ora Dell'addio\\" are great 'classical music' tracks. \\"Hidden Away\\" is great track with great vocals by Josh Groban (JG) & beautiful melody. \\"Au Jardin De Sans - Pourquoi\\" is another great 'classical music' track. \\"Higher Window\\" is a great track : great acouistic guitar & amazing vocals by JG. \\"If I Walk Away\\" is a great track : great Spanish guitar & great vocals by JG. \\"Love Only Knows\\" is another great track with great guitar & vocals. \\"Voce' Existe Em Mim\\" is a solid track/gem : great drum & violin combination with great 'racy' vocals. \\"Wait At Home\\" is a great, slow orchestral track with great vocal 'entrance' at the start of the song. \\"London Hymn\\" is a okay orchestral/choir song, The closing track, \\"Straight To You\\" is a solid track/gem : beautiful music & great vocals. This is my favourite track from this rather 'departure album' by Josh Groban & hence the title of my review, \\"Straight To You\\". Josh Groban may be 'exploring new territory' but his talent still shines through in this new CD release \\"Illuminations\\". It's a great CD release effort, worth listening to carefully, it does 'grow' on you.
B002OB9KPE|5.0|Transatlantic will knock your socks off in a Whrilwind! For many, Pink Floyd's The Wall is considered one of the best concept projects.  Wrong.  Yes, you heard correctly, WRONG.  Transatlantic's Whirlwind wins hands down.  This concept is more uplifting and musical talent is superb.  If one truly takes the time to sit and listen to this 79 minute song in its entirety, one will find that you will be listening over and over.  The second disc of cover songs is ok, but the main disc is worth the investment in money and listening time.  Transatlantic also released a live (London) CD that covers the Whirlwind song along with many others.  Once you have drenched yourself in the Whrilwind studio CD, you will want to listen to this live version.  As a kid, it would be comparative to receiving two prizes in a box of cereal.  Totally cool!  Highly recommend.  MAD
B00454U1NS|4.0|This is a great CD release by the talented lady rocker P!nk (Alecia Beth Moore), titled \\"Greatest Hits ... So Far\\". As with many hits/greatest compilations, not every fans would be 100% satisfied with the CD release as some fan's favourite songs may have been overlooked/omitted for one reason or another. This great CD opens with \\"Get The Party Started\\" : a great rocking track with great vocals & harmonies. The tracks, \\"There You Go\\" & \\"Family Portrait\\" are great pop rock tracks by P!nk. \\"Don't Let Me Get Me\\" is a solid rock track/gem with great guitar chords & beautiful melody. \\"Just Like A Pill\\" is another solid hard rock track/gem with great (guitar, melody & harmonies). \\"Trouble\\" is a rather 'noisy' okay rock track. \\"Stupid Girls\\" is a great rock track. \\"Who Knew\\" is a solid track/gem with great vocals. \\"U + UR Hand\\" is a great hard rock with P!nk on high pitched/range vocals. \\"Dear Mr. President\\" is a solid 'social statement' track/gem : great acoustic guitar, beautiful clear vocals & features the band, Indigo Girls. This is my favourite track from this great CD. \\"So What\\" is a great loud rock track. \\"Sober\\" is another great track : great rhythm guitar with P!nk showing off her beautiful high vocal range. \\"Please Don't Leave Me\\" is a solid P!nk classic track/gem : great melody & harmonies. The song was written during her strained relationship with Carey Hart (their relationship luckily/happily went back on track)! \\"Raise Your Glass\\" is a great rocking track with high pitched/range vocals. It's a rather 'unusual sounding' track when compared to most of her tracks, especially those included here (showing variability in her songs) [Her fantastic live performance of this great track on American Music Awards on 11/21/10 was one of the best of the night!] \\"******' Perfect\\" is a solid laid-back track/gem : great vocals/harmony & great violin in the background. A great closing track remembering that P!nk has just announced (a day after this CD release) she is a few months pregnant now with husband Carey Hart's child. On overall, this is a great CD release by the talented rocker P!nk that will please most of her loyal fans & hopefully find many new ones as well in the process, a highly recommended listening.
B003IMERWY|5.0|There is an excellent review by \\"Bob\\" from L.A. that discusses different audio versions of this disc.  I don't have the HDCD or SHM-CD versions of this disc to compare to. That would be the ideal, no doubt. So with that limitation, I will say that this new MFSL gold is an excellent audiophile release of my favorite Yes disc.  The Yes Album really was the first presentation of Classic Yes and the songs remain my favorites by a long shot. Steve Howe makes a stunning debut with the band on guitar. Like Steve Hackett of Genesis, he was the key guitar addition to an existing band that elevated them immediately.  I really like Tony Kaye's effective keyboards and while not the virtuoso that Rick Wakeman was, this Yes Album lineup really gels.  Once Wakeman joined, Yes became big with 'Fragile' and then progressively more complex with each release, in some ways too much so for their own good. They imploded after 'Tales' and the revolving door of members became commonplace. But on The Yes Album, they were focused and wrote true classics such as \\"Yours Is No Disgrace\\", \\"I've Seen All Good People/Your Move\\", \\"Perpetual Change\\" and \\"Starship Trooper\\".  But as this was my first Yes album, I am biased and much of that is emotional. I am sure people who bought 'Close To The Edge' as their first Yes album would feel the same.    I am not a big fan of the newest batch of Mobile Fidelity discs.  Some are excellent, incorporating SACD as well as gold quality (eg. \\"Everybody's In Showbiz\\" by the Kinks).  Others, such as the new release of Abraxas by Santana and Yes' Fragile leave me wanting more sonically.  So it is a mixed bag now where I used to hear consistently higher quality from Mobile Fidelity.  I am happy to write that this MFSL release of The Yes Album is the best that I have heard of the newbies.  Not boxy, not too bright.  Nor did they impose a loudness boost that can ruin some remastering.    When I listen to a new release of an album that I know well but new things are heard, I know something special has happened. Such is the case with the new Mobile Fidelity gold of The Yes Album.  Unless you go vinyl, this is as good as I can imagine hearing digitally. I have a number of different formats of cd's - SACD, SHM-CD, HDCD, HQ, Blu-Spec and gold discs such as Mobile Fidelity and DCC/Audio Fidelity. The most consistent for me are the older MFSL gold discs and SACD.  I am happy to add this gold cd to one of my better sounding ones. As Bob also said, it is too bad that reviews of different cd releases get lumped in together sometimes on Amazon.  So I will be specific once more and say that this new MFSL gold release of The Yes Album is highly recommended.

B002ZG98Z0|1.0|Who was the genius who decided to make this second movie about the long running series? The first movie was very long in getting to theatres, and somewhat worth it (although I did wait for the DVD to rent). This one? Where do I start?<br />The gay wedding was ridiclous. Carrie is starting to look just like a WITCH, who has flown through a wind tunnel while getting a bad perm, even with the mole removed. SJP needs to gain some weight. At her age, being that skinny just makes her look older, and what's worse, hard. I remember when she could wear JUST about anything and it looked great. Now? Not so much.<br />And leaving New York with her four friends and going to a Muslim country? I mean, I knew they went, I just couldn't believe how horrible it was. And her reason for leaving? No \\"sparkle\\" with Big? WHAT? She wanted JEWLERY for their anniversary. How much STUFF does even Carrie NEED?<br />Has Samantha uttered any words that aren't sexual double entendres lately? Like in the past 8 years? A man can't even ask her to dinner without her saying something like \\"It depends on what will be in my MOUTH\\" or something like that. It makes me wince, and her voice is now like a parody of the voice she used to have.<br />I know, I know, suspend disbelief. TO A POINT. In a Muslim country, they make it clear how women are supposed to dress, and behave. Of course I expected Samantha to buck everything. But she basically acted like a desperate old Cougar. And, may I ask, why did all the women in the hotel have MANSERVANTS? That would NEVER HAPPEN. They would have women to wait on them. Any man who took a job like that in that country would be..I don't know, but it would not be pleasant I am sure.<br />THE CLOTHES WERE HORRIBLE. Samatha looked like she was going to compete to lead the John Philip Sousa marching band, and anyone within four feet of her on either side would have been knocked senseless with those shouler pads she wore all the time. She had shoulder pads IN HER BATHROBE. She also seems to attract any attractive male within 100 miles who has a great body and is about thirty. Could she attract such men occasionally? Of course! ALL THE TIME? No way. And I think that Samantha has said \\"buh bye\\" to menopause a while ago, so that seemed ridiculous. And didn't she have breast cancer? Using all those products; not a good idea.<br />When Carrie runs into Aiden in the street, I had a super \\"OH I AM SO SURE\\" moment, but I gave it time, and it was ridiculous. Then, she calls Big and tells him she kissed Aiden. It's called \\"Don't tell\\", or \\"wait until you get home\\".<br />Lastly, the Charlotte not being a good mother thing, and that ridiculous Nanny she had hired who never wore a bra. The one who was young, gorgeous, busty, did cartwheels without a bra, jumping jacks without a bra, got sprayed on the front of her Tee Shirt without a bra on...Please. And she confesses \\"Sometimes, I just don't want to be around the kids\\". REALLY? How shocking!<br />No wonder it was in the theatres for like, a minute. It was horrible. And I could not get into any of it, but it's great to watch with your friends, after having a couple of glasses of wine or whatever. The funny comments to make...there are so many. It's sort of like \\"Sex in the City/Plan Nine From Outer Space\\". Horrible, but you can't turn away. Also, funny and embarrassing. Only not on purpose. FAIL. They need to stop......now. Actually, they needed to stop after the first movie.ract any attractive male within 100 miles who has a great body and is about thirty. Could she attract such men occasionally? Of course!

B003ZHQVJO|3.0|This cd is nothing exciting... Kid Rock has lost his way... sold out!  I'm a huge fan of Kid Rock but this cd was pretty disappointing to me, I'm getting sick of all his songs sounding the same and sending the same message.  Where is the old Kid Rock? I was really hoping he would do more stuff like he used to, more rock!  Everything on this album is more or less... LAME.  Don't waste your money.
B004259BMM|4.0|I've enjoyed Keith Urban's music for a long time now.  His guitar playing is like no other. I do a lot of road travel, driving long distances. He and a few other artists are at the top of my play list when I'm stuck in a car for long periods.  I'm definitely looking forward to adding Get Closer to my collection next time I'm driving.  My favorites from this CD are Georgia Woods and Without You. Both are good representations of his strengths as a balladeer and guitarist. I'm not someone who picks a CD apart to determine which sound matches which ever past albums.  In my mind, musicians experiment with their craft...it's how they grow in their profession.  However, in Get Closer, Urban seems to have reached into what he's already discovered musically and fused it all together. Some songs give reminders of his earlier works, but there are enough differences to think he's still stretching and growing musically.  But, next time around, I'd love to see him reach outside of the box lyrically.  He is definitely an iconic balladeer of love songs, both the uplifting and down right depressing ones. That said,I hope someday he'll look at life events and emotions other than those of a couple in love and feel compelled enought to write and sing about them too. I know he's capable...two of my favorite songs of his are Song for Dad and You're Not My God. All in all though, I really like this CD and I agree with the others....see him in concert!  It's an amazing musical experience!
073937771X|5.0|The series of 3 books are excellent and it's really a shame that there will  never be any more.
B004BC7MRM|1.0|Totally disappointing \\"CROP\\", i.e. crappy (country) pop, from the one time rap-rocker who put out some memorable music back in the day. He's clearly sold out to today's generation of folks that thrive on the same old sound that many of the new artists are producing. In today's \\"herd mentality\\" society, KR realized his new sound will sell, so he decided to shout out \\"Show Me The Money\\", as if he didn't already have enough. In my opinion, as a member of the classic rock generation who has grown to love modern rock as well, this album has NO redeeeming value, but will surely appeal to those who believe you must love \\"CROP\\" to be a truly patriotic American. How sad that our society has gone in this direction, where we can't think for ourselves and stand up for the truly talented artists that deserve our support. Kid Rock is no longer on that list. Stick a fork in it, Bro! :(

Although the Camel Club members are not as prominent in this book the reader always has a sense they are poised ready to save the day. Oliver is fighting for his country, his president, and his life but at each step of his investigation he is learning he can not trust anyone but his new ally, or can he?    Is the theme of this book so far from what's really going on in our present day world?

B0018PJEYY|5.0|You'll notice that I said the least interesting, but yet I still gave it five stars.  Why?  Well, it is because the main seven Moody Blues albums are all legendary classics.  The Moody Blues were way ahead of their time, and even though they were playing all the way through the nineties, their main seven are the songs people want to hear when they are in concert.  I have their \\"Live at Red Rocks\\" DVD and it's probably their best live performance although I wish there were more video material of their progressive rock era.<br /><br />I've listened to this album all my life so it's easy to forget that only one song from this album was actually a charted hit.  The song \\"Question\\" charted as high as #21 in 1970.  This track was just as odd to hear on pop radio as Led Zeppelin's \\"Whole Lotta Love.\\"  It's amazing how diverse pop radio was back in the early seventies.  The Jackson Five, Neil Diamond, Carpenters, CCR, and then The Moody Blues and others?  Everyone in music was so wonderfully different from each other back then.<br /><br />When I hear the Brothers Four playing \\"Greenfields\\" from back in 1960, I can't help but to compare it to the Moody Blues' \\"And The Tide Rushes In.\\"  My favorite songs from \\"A Question of Balance\\" is (well practically every track on side two, but anyway), \\"Minstrel's Song\\", and \\"Melancholy Man.\\" These few really do stand out as my favorites.<br /><br />From \\"Days of Future Passed\\" to \\"Seventh Sojourn\\", the Moody Blues play a very important part of the Progressive Rock era, along side of Emerson, Lake, and Palmer, King Crimson, Yes, Genesis, Pink Floyd, Strawbs, Aphrodite's Child, Eloy, and Triumvirat and many others.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Listen, if you love this movie, you are going to really enjoy this version on blu-ray. A lot of people on here are complaining and whining about the fact that they've already purchased the original version and don't want to shell out more money. The simple fact is that we all knew that the original release was a bare bones version released to coincide with Earth Day. I skipped the original release and patiently waiting for the extended edition release. It's a definite buy for those who did not purchase the Earth Day version. Is it worth purchasing again if you did buy the original? That's up for you to decide. I was really interested in seeing how James Camermon brought the world of Pandora to life. Also, the deleted and extended scenes are really cool, with lots of new creatures and a new beginning to the film with Jake Sully on earth. I really enjoyed it, but if you are one the many that already bought the original version, buy it if you're a big fan, wait until next years black friday to get it dirt cheap.
030758660X|5.0|I must say I was a little wary ... I've never done well with patterns before but recently got, shall I say, reinvigorated, with my knitting so decided to take on some patterns again.  I chose this book out of the many many others here at Amazon because 1. I love vampires (-_-), and 2. these look really cute and unique.<br /><br />I am SO absolutely thrilled with this book~!!  Not only are the patterns really well written and easy to understand, and fully illustrated so you can see exactly what it's supposed to look like, but also, for beginners or almost-beginners who aren't quite intermediate yet (like me!) there's a handy reference section in the back that will teach you every stitch you need to know!<br /><br />The icing on the cake here is that the photos are incredibly gorgeous.  Every single item is photographed so beautifully that it makes me want to sit down and knit every. single. one. RIGHT NOW!!  AHhhhh so many beautiful things so little space for yarn!  XD<br /><br />I highly recommend this.  Even if you're not a fan of vamps, there are enough cute patterns in this book to keep you satisfied ~ short cloak like capes, shrugs, hand warmers, mittens, and hats... oh my!  Simply wonderful.  :3
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I really enjoy this new album from Josh Groban. I appreciate that he is trying to experiment with song writing and venture out from the \\"pop-era\\" label that the general public had given him. I think that there's a realization that people don't always want crystal clear vocals and over-produced sounds. That's why groups such as Radiohead are successful, or artists like Bob Dylan and Paul Simon. While I love Josh Groban's previous albums, I prefer Rick Rubin's approach to producing rather than David Foster's. I have great respect for David Foster, but I prefer Rick Rubin's approach to Illuminations. I think he did a wonderful job helping Josh Groban expand his skills as an artist. I think that if Josh Groban continues to go down  this path, that he will gain more success and also gain new fans who may have not liked his material before. Favorites of mine from the album include: Higher Window (I don't think I could tire of listening to this song), If I Walk Away, Love Only Knows. The only song I felt kind of mediocre about was Galileo. I don't necessarily dislike the song, but I don't find myself enjoying it as much as the others on the album. I think this album is definitely worth looking into!
B003F3NE1Q|5.0|Arguably the best medical drama in many years.  Focus tends to be equally shared between relationships and medical emergencies.  There are a lot of new cast members but don't worry about keeping track of them.  A shooter in the finale does some of them in and everyone has to deal with that trauma in the next season.  BTW, early on George's character story comes to a close (no spoilers).  Yes, it's melodrama but it's goooood melodrama!  WHEN WATCHED: 2009; MY GRADE: A minus to A.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|Kid Rock tried way too hard to \\"sound mature\\" on this CD.  Case in point ...    My parents (who are 62 years old) went to go see Kid Rock in concert.  Not really knowing his music, they thought that it would all be very much like \\"Picture\\".  They hated the show and thought it was \\"horrible & loud\\".  I, by the way, was at the same concert and I thought it was AWESOME!     Fast forward to the release of \\"Born Free\\" ...    I can't stand it.  It's way too mellow and adult contemporary for me.  I gave it to my parents and they LOVE every song.  Who would have thought that Kid Rock would put out an album that parents like more than their adult kids?      Ugh.  BIG DISAPPOINTMENT.  Unless you like your \\"Rock\\" to be mellow & lame.  Kid Rock is now Kid Lame.  There is nothing that even resembles rock on this album.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|The songs on this CD are different and yet still beautiful coming from the throat of Josh Groban. I love the beautiful Galileo, Bells of New York City and Higher Window. This CD is a must have if you like Josh Groban. Buy it even if you don't, he'll grow on you.
B00428ZRFY|4.0|Rihanna is back with her 5th studio album; 'Loud'. After the 2009 release of the much underrated (no pun intended) 'Rated R', Rihanna decides to take us back to a more pop/dance vibe on 'Loud'.<br />Rihanna is not really known for being a great singer with a phenomenal voice, but she is known to deliver catchy, radio-friendly songs and that's what you get on her latest effort.<br /><br />The CD kicks off with the very up-tempo and club-ready \\"S&M\\"; one of the highlights of the CD. This song pulls you in with its infectious hook and heavy beats. The CD then goes into her current smash that she collaborated  with Drake on; \\"What's My Name\\". \\"What's My Name\\" is tailor made for the radio with a very catchy hook and repetitive chorus. \\"Cheers (Drink To That)\\" finds Rihanna toasting to the weekend over a sampled element from one of Avril Lavigne's first hits: \\"I'm With You\\". The song tends to get a bit repetitive, but I'm sure will find success on the radio. \\"Fading\\" is a nice mid-tempo ballad that speaks about a guy that has changed and is in turn fading away. \\"Only Girl\\" was the first single released from 'Loud' and made it as high as #3 on the Billboard Hot 100. Much like \\"S&M\\", \\"Only Girl\\" is a club thumping song that makes you just want to get up and move to. When this song comes on, it's hard to deny the infectious beats and lyrics. \\"California King Bed\\" is another ballad that is set over heavy electric guitar. The vocals are good, but at times reminds me a lot of the 80's hair band anthems down to the guitar solo included on this song. The next few songs is where I feel the CD gets very weak. \\"Man Down\\" (Co-written by Shontelle) is a very island influenced song that is reminiscent of very early Rhanna songs. I really do not care for this song and skip over it. I had really high hopes for \\"Raining Men\\" which features one of the hottest acts our right now: Nicki Minaj. Even Nicki cannot save this lackluster song. I found the song to be very overproduced with so many things going on at once that it ends up just sounding like a lot of noise.  Rihanna quickly picks up the weakness of the CD on \\"Complicated\\". Not a huge stand-out track, but it's fun and has a good beat to it. \\"Skin\\" is just a song that is there, in my opinion, not good and not bad. It's a bit bland for my liking. The last song is the follow up to Eminem's and Rihanna's #1 song \\"Love The Way You Lie\\" appropriately titled \\"Love The Way You Lie Part II\\". This song is phenomenal.

B004BLJQOK|4.0|The last thing I wanted to see was a vampire movie with kids; I was a huge vampire fan in the '70's but I'm 50 now and after \\"Buffy\\" I realized there was nowhere to go with monster/horror except space, the final frontier. Of all the movies playing at our 13-plex one got a good review- \\"Let Me In\\". I wasn't aware of any other version, as I stopped following film business in the '90's, and found myself very satisfied with the relationship of a bullied 12 or 13 year old boy and a girl in the snow with no shoes or jacket. (In fact I can't recall ever seeing barefoot vampire girls in the snow. Lugosi's girls may have been barefoot, but they were always in the cellar of the castle wandering around the coffins.) The relationship between the girl and her caretaker ( way to go, Mr. Jenkins!) was interesting and I'm sure started out similar to the two teen leads. We seldom go to films but this was one very satisfying especially since the story of a teen vamp and company can be appealing to my demographic. Did I want to BE a vampire when I was 13?

8498676029|4.0|This is a very strange book. Two U.S. Marshals arrive on a ferry from the mainland at an island given over to an institution for the criminally insane. They specialize in the most dangerous of the dangerous, and one of their prisoners has escaped. U.S. Marshal Teddy Daniels (with his new partner, Chuck, in tow) figures it can't be that hard to find her again. It's an island: Where can she go? As Teddy interviews the staff and the other patients, and as he and Chuck explore the island, he gradually learns that very unpleasant things are going on at Shutter Island. Human experimentation of the sort outlawed at Nuremburg. If he can get back to Boston and report his discoveries, the operation will be shut down and its personnel will be looking at criminal charges themselves. But things just aren't quite right. And for the sake of those who haven't read the book (or seen the movie), that's all I'm prepared to say -- except that this gripping story is a pretty fast read, so find a quiet place next Sunday and settle in. It's also rather nerve-wracking and a bit scary, especially if you're inclined to believe in the existence of government black ops projects. And the last couple of chapters are amazing, because everything you thought you had figured out is probably wrong. One small comment, though: I really don't think they were telling light bulb jokes in 1954.
B0000507QH|5.0|If you enjoy the raw and pure storylines of French filmmaking, this one's for you.  Only the French know how to take a simple subject matter and turn it into a riveting drama.  The casting is perfect with Charles Benning and Sophie Guillemin.  You would think they were lovers in real life (maybe they are).  And the music is a perfect background for this erotic adventure.  A must.  All 5 stars!
B003YK42LQ|5.0|All of KOL's efforts have been worth owning and this is Another great album by KOL.  If you appreciate great musicality and a KOL listener, you will need to get this album NOW.  Every song on this disc is great.   It's inspiring to hear a band in this day and age produce some authentic, interesting, \\"real\\"kickin rock-n-roll music. Caleb's vocals are AMAZING and truly original in delivery and enunciation.   The band just keeps getting better and better. The bonus edition has a really cool version of Closer.   ROCK lives thanks to KOL!!!!!  Thank's guys!  Keep em coming!
B00064WSNW|5.0|Easily the best album they've released with Belew in the line-up, this album features some incredible pieces with each player really getting a chance to shine. Bruford is still with the group at this point and lays down some great stuff, especially on Indiscipline. This album has the ubiquitous Tony Levin on it as well who provides some great riffs, particularly on Thela Hun Gingeet.<br /><br />There are no weak tracks and every song is a great piece all by itself. Together, this is easily one of the best albums King Crimson has put out and some would argue is in the top 25 or 50 prog albums of all time. I really can't recommend this one enough and even now, decades later the music is still fresh, relevant and hasn't dated at all. If you're a fan of 70's prog/prog-rock, fusion, or just great music this is a must from any prog lover to own.
B00454U1NS|4.0|Pink will do just that: get the party started!!!  Pink has been a force to be reckoned with in the music industry for the past 10+ years. A lot of people these days release a premature greatest hits CD, but Pink is more than deserving to have all her hits showcased on one CD and she has plenty of them.<br />All the songs remind me of different times in my life, both good and bad. It's a good listen to some good classics plus you get 2 new songs.<br /><br />Here's my gripe - Pink started out with more of an R&B sound with 'Can't Take Me Home' and the hits from that \\"era\\" were almost completely ignored here. Included is \\"There You Go' and \\"Family Portrait\\". Where are \\"Most Girls\\" and \\"You Make Me Sick\\"?? They were both big hits in their own right and much bigger hits than \\"Family Portrait\\" and a few other songs included on this set.<br />\\"Feel Good Time\\" is another song that was completely left off this package and that was a hit as well.<br /><br />That's the bad and frankly something I am completely confused over.<br /><br />The 2 new tracks included here: \\"Raise Your Glass\\" and \\"F**** Perfect\\" are both instant Pink classics. They both have the potential to be included in a greatest hits package in another 10 years.<br /><br />All in all, I am glad that Pink released a greatest hits set, but I wish some of her hits would have made the cut in place of some of the lesser known songs that ended up being included.
0316069485|3.0|The idea here is an interesting one -- Mickey Haller, hardcore defense attorney and protagonist of _The Lincoln Lawyer,_ is invited by the DA to sign on as a special prosecutor in the re-trial of a convicted murderer sprung from San Quentin after twenty-four years by genetic evidence that didn't match. Haller has misgivings but it's a challenge he finds he can't resist -- as long as he's allowed to have his ex-wife as second chair (the first one, a real prosecutor; his second ex-wife works for Mickey as his office manager) and his half-brother, Harry Bosch, as chief investigator. The plot is pretty straightforward, following the prosecution team as they build a case without making any mention of the previous trial (that's a no-no), watching Haller predict from his own experience what the defendant's grand-standing defense lawyer will do next, and following Harry in alternate chapters as he struggles to locate witnesses and others from the original investigation a quarter of a century ago. And that's about it. There's a neat bit of courtroom strategy involving a \\"silent witness\\" which the reader assumes will lead into a greater dramatic scene -- but that never happens. Instead, the author goes off the rails completely and destroys the entire progression of the plot. It's like Connelly couldn't think of a good way to end what had become a thoroughly telegraphed climax and just pitched a hand grenade into the middle of things instead. After his previous book, _Nine Dragons,_ I have to wonder if Connelly has simply used himself up.
B0043URV8M|5.0|The conclusion of the Harry Potter saga is as much of a cinematic event as it was a literary one when J.K. Rowling's eagerly-awaited seventh book, Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, was released in July 2007 and broke a myriad of records for book sales. The success of the Harry Potter franchise is quite astonishing: it is reportedly responsible for almost single-handedly revitalizing the children's literature market, brought fantasy fiction out of geekdom and into the mainstream, and of course made Rowling herself a gazillionaire, thanks not only to the book sales but also to the spin off merchandise, theme park rides, and of course the movies and soundtracks based on her work.    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows, the seventh film in the series, is again directed by David Yates, and features Daniel Radcliffe, Emma Watson and Rupert Grint as Harry, Hermione and Ron, the three protagonists of the saga. Picking up from the immediate aftermath of Dumbledore's death and Voldemort's rise to power at the end of the sixth film, Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince, Deathly Hallows sees Harry, Hermione and Ron leaving Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry to search for and destroy the remaining horcruxes: pieces of Voldemort's soul which were hidden inside everyday objects in an attempt to make himself immortal. With Voldemort having taken over Hogwarts and rekindled his reign of terror in the wizarding world, Harry and his friends essentially become fugitives, desperately trying to evade capture by Voldemort's agents. Eventually Harry learns of the existence of the `deathly hallows' of the title, a trio of exceptionally powerful magical objects which he believes will help swing the balance of power in his favor, and eventually defeat Voldemort once and for all. The film has been split into two parts, with Part II coming to theaters in the summer of 2011.    Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows boasts possibly the most impressive cast of British actors in any film in recent memory: alongside regulars Michael Gambon, Alan Rickman, Maggie Smith, Robbie Coltrane, Ralph Fiennes, Jason Isaacs, Helena Bonham-Carter, John Hurt, Brendan Gleeson, Jim Broadbent, Emma Thompson, Gary Oldman and David Thewlis, the new cast also manages to add such luminaries as Rhys Ifans, Jamie Campbell-Bower, Ciaran Hinds and Bill Nighy. Impressive indeed. One person not returning, however, is composer Nicholas Hooper, who decided to not to take the opportunity to score the finale. His place at the podium is taken by French composer Alexandre Desplat, whose status as one of the most in-demand composers working in the film industry today has now been well and truly cemented.    First things's first: like Nick Hooper before him, and like Patrick Doyle before him, Desplat's score does not make any obvious references to thematic material from the previous scores, with the exception of some brief lip service to John Williams' famous theme, \\"Hedwig's Theme\\", paid in a couple of the album's cues. This will drive Williams fans insane, especially those who clamored for Williams to return to score the finale, but the point I made in my review of Hooper's score for Harry Potter and the Half-Blood Prince last summer is still relevant here: the Harry Potter of Book 7 is not the Harry Potter of Book 1. He isn't the wide eyed-innocent child at large in a new and fantastical world. He is a deeply troubled young adult, plagued by his past, surrounded by the death of his family and friends, weighed down by the pressures of an ancient prophecy, who must fight to the death to save the world which has embraced him as its savior. As such, it makes perfect sense that the flighty, whimsical nature of the first few scores has necessarily been supplanted by darker, more mature music. Owls, Quidditch games, and schoolyard rivalries are no longer Harry's mains concerns, and so the music Williams wrote to accompany these things is naturally less important to the story. This isa story - and a score - about danger, anguish, regret, and sacrifice, and Desplat's music inevitably reflects these things.    Desplat's music is fully orchestral and choral, performed with gusto by the London Symphony Orchestra and various choirs, alongside various specialist solo instruments ranging from the common (guitars, recorders) to the slightly unusual (a mandolin, a shakuhachi bamboo flute) to the downright peculiar, most notably a theorbo, which is a kind of a baroque long-necked lute. One thing I love about the score is that it is, in every way, a Desplat score: it features many of his personal stylistic trademarks, from the use of woodwinds as percussion, to the interpolation of a synth pulse to add more bass to certain sequences, the use of precise timpani rhythms, and specific phrasings in the string and brass writing which will be immediately recognizable to anyone who has followed Desplat's career. I am very pleased that he has not been forced to supplant his musical identity in order to fit the needs of the film, and has instead tweaked it in the right direction of his own accord, adding only the necessary amounts of magic to the mix.    The opening cue, \\"Obliviate\\", gradually builds out of a see-sawing string motif to present a noble new theme for strings and solo cello, before entering the first of several high-drama sequences in which the orchestra stretches its legs: \\"Snape to Malfoy Manor\\", despite clocking in at just under 2 minutes, presents a wonderful sense of darkness, foreboding and breathless energy. Different sections of the orchestra play off each other in bubbling counterpoint, underpinned by hooting bass clarinets, fluttering flutes, harp glissandi, almost subliminal gasps on the breathy shakuhachi, choral vocalizations, and a thrusting brass ostinato. It's all quite wonderful.    The film has a cool half-dozen knockout action sequences, beginning with the amazing \\"Sky Battle\\", and running through later cues such as the tumultuous \\"Death Eaters\\", the raucous \\"Fireplaces Escape\\", and the cacophonous \\"Destroying the Locket\\". Anyone familiar with Desplat's action music from scores such as Firewall, The Golden Compass and The Ghost Writer from earlier this year will be thrilled by the dynamite string runs which leap up and down scales with boundless energy, which this time around are accompanied by all manner of orchestral mayhem and choral accents. \\"Sky Battle\\" features a wonderful string phrase underneath the action which sounds like a deconstructed, slightly off-kilter version of Hedwig's theme, but which is quickly usurped by the vivacious, attention-grabbing orchestral performances that surround it. This cue, more than any other, should finally dispel the ludicrous myth that Desplat can only do pretty waltzes and can't write more forceful material.    \\"Ministry of Magic\\", \\"Detonators\\" and \\"The Locket\\" are a clever trio of pieces which underscore Harry's infiltration of the ministry to recover Regulus Black's missing locket from Dolores Umbridge. \\"Ministry of Magic\\" is all brusque business, a busy and self-important sounding piece which razzle-dazzles with blustery marches and percussion runs, but which masks a darker inner core. The hooting woodwinds in \\"Detonators\\" seem to have the same sense of twinkling tomfoolery that any self-respecting Weasley product would have, although the thunderous timpani hits and subsequent string-led lament hint at the inherent danger of the situation. \\"The Locket\\" itself revisits the slightly saccharine sound Hooper gave the Umbridge character in The Order of the Phoenix, although this time her true nature is subtly revealed by making her motif snaky, slithery, and more than a little deceitful.    The music for the sequence in which Harry and Hermione visit his childhood home in Godric's Hollow, which includes \\"The Exodus\\", \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\" and \\"Bathilda Bagshot\\", is the closet the Potter music has come to all-out horror. \\"The Exodus\\" is a tormentedpiece for a detuned violin, ominous clarinet accents, and portentous string chords, emphasizing the danger about to overwhelm the friends. \\"Godric's Hollow Graveyard\\" is filled with a palpable sense of sadness as Harry finally visits his parents' grave: the solo cello motif and the mandolin accents combined with the warm, bittersweet string theme gives the whole sequence an attractive-yet-melancholy tone, while the piano echoes give the scene a cold, wintry overtone. Things come to a head in \\"Bathilda Bagshot\\", which layers tension upon tension upon tension, exacerbated by anxious blasts on the shakuhachi wood flute (one of James Horner's favorite colors), before exploding into a powerful sequence of tremendous orchestral savagery at the cue's end.    \\"Captured and Tortured\\" features some stark, unnerving synth elements and thunderous percussion writing, which pounds and pummels away before turning into another dark lament for brooding strings and wailing woodwinds. It eventually explodes into the score's final action sequence, \\"Rescuing Hermione\\", which is replete with more rapid-fire string runs and effortless energy.    At the other end of the scale, a warm and noble new brass theme for the Order of the Phoenix opens \\"Polyjuice Potion\\", before heading off into a series of light and whimsical sequences featuring prominent woodwinds and glittering chimes which retain a brief semblance of the magic and mischief of previous scores. It's the last time there will be any magic or mischief for a while. The only cue which comes close to returning to that style is \\"Lovegood\\", the cue for Harry's encounter with the duplicitous Xenophilius Lovegood, whose revelations about the nature of the Hallows set Harry on his quest. Lovegood's music is slightly peculiar and a little exotic, mixing all manner of shaking and rattling percussion, ragged bass flutes, and an uptempo main theme to illustrate an important, if a little deranged, character. It's slightly reminiscent of the music Desplat wrote for the equally offbeat Gyptians in The Golden Compass, but without their sense of fun and raucousness.    Of the other cues of note, \\"The Will\\" is a textural piece full of mystery and uncertainty which features an ethereal choir offset by warm guitar chords and nervously trilling flutes, fondly remembering Dumbledore's kindness, but tempering it with an unexpected sense of menace. Later, \\"Dobby\\" has his own little motif, a playful dance for mandolins, the aforementioned theorbo, and light percussion gongs which encapsulate his impish nature, and which builds up a surprising head of steam as it develops.    There are also several moments of great emotional pathos. \\"At the Burrow\\" has a beautiful sense of longing, especially in the moments when a solo horn takes center stage, and maintains a defiantly tragic feeling as the cue progresses, even when you think the strings are going to erupt into a large-scale romantic theme. The theme for \\"Harry and Ginny\\" is in no way straightforwardly romantic, touching instead on the sense of separation the pair feels when forced apart. Desplat's piano performances in this cue reinforce this notion by remaining slightly unresolved and out of step; pretty, but in no way happy.    The solo cello returns in the beautiful yet devastating \\"Ron Leaves\\", which is about as dark and emotionally powerful as Harry Potter music ever gets. Later, \\"Ron's Speech\\" revisits similar thematic material, but with a warmer, gentler aspect that speaks of fraternal friendship and resolve. The conclusive \\"Farewell to Dobby\\", with its sorrowfully tender cello performance, makes me salivate at the prospect of the music Desplat may write for the overwhelming and harrowing finale of Part II.    Possibly the only negative thing about Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows is the lack of a single, identifying theme for the film in itself. Whereas Sorcerer's Stone had a multitude of themes, Chamber of Secrets had \\"Fawkes the Phoenix\\", Prisoner of Azkaban had \\"Window to the Past\\", Goblet of Fire had \\"Harry in Winter\\", and so on and so on, Deathly Hallows is a little on the anonymous side in terms of thematic memorability. Even Hedwig's Theme, the singular defining musical motif of the entire series, features briefly in just three cues: \\"Polyjuice Potion\\", \\"Sky Battle\\" and \\"The Will\\", despite Desplat's claim that he tried to incorporate the theme at regular intervals. Desplat's musical ideas are all excellent, but none of them ever rise to the fore in the way one might have expected: this is a score of very good underscore, but you're not going to hear it as a concert suite, and cinema-goers aren't going to leave the theater whistling the main theme.    This review of the soundtrack for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I is of the regular release, which features 26 cues and runs for a generous 73 minutes. In addition to this, there are two additional releases: a limited edition bonus disc box set which includes six additional music cues (\\"Voldemort\\", \\"Grimmauld Place\\", \\"The Dumbledores\\", \\"The Tale of the Three Brothers\\", \\"Bellatrix\\" and \\"My Love Is Always Here\\"), and a deluxe digital album of the soundtrack which will include three more tracks outside of the 26 original, although it is currently unclear whether these are three of the six from the collector's set.    So, I've given yet another Alexandre Desplat score a five-star review, which I have no doubt will lead some readers to accuse me of bias, or predictability, or whatever other derogatory term crosses their mind. I make no secret of the fact that I honestly believe Desplat to be the most exciting musical voice to emerge in film music since the turn of the millennium, and for me Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part I just reinforces that view. Irrespective of any complaints about thematic consistency with other films in the series, or the lack of a prominent main theme in this score, I honestly feel that this score is one of Desplat's greatest achievements, and highlights everything I love about his work; the orchestral textures, the intricate use of unexpected instruments in unexpected settings, the crystal clarity of his orchestrations. But what this score has over others in his canon is emotion: unashamed, heart-on-sleeve emotion, which embraces the darkness of the story and runs with it, thrilling the listener with powerful action and forcing the listener to feel Harry's pain with equal skill. For me, this is unquestionably one of the best scores of 2010, and I hope beyond hope that Desplat's services are retained for Harry Potter and the Deathly Hallows Part II next summer.

B003VON1S0|5.0|This was my first introduction to Blind Guardian and quite frankly I am very impressed. I guess I should state that I do have the Demons and Wizards album \\"Touched by the Crimson King\\" that I purchased \\"blind\\" after finishing King's Dark Tower series and was chomping at the bit for anything Tower related. That album was good, but not great and didn't have nearly the depth or maturity or diversity this one does. They open the album with a very strong classically influenced piece with a very nice symphonic introduction that segues very nicely into the opening song. Apparently this is a song used on a video game but this was my first exposure to it and I liked it quite a bit.<br /><br />From there the album incorporates elements from heavy double bass drum power metal type music to bard's tale/irish pub type anthem's to some proggish-type metal and everything in between. The classical/symphonic influences are abundant on the album and used to good effect and the song writing and melodic content is especially strong for a group that has a lot of heavy/power metal going on. Vocals are great and augment the music nicely and I really appreciated the diversity on the this album.<br /><br />As for the rating, I'd probably give it a 4.5 or so because there were a few lulls on the album in places where it didn't quite keep me plugged in, but that's true of most albums. All in all I thought this was an excellent album and is definitely a great reason for me to look into purchasing more Blind Guardian albums.

B004BC7MRM|2.0|Kid rock to me was always know as the american badass. And this just makes me want to cry. I used to use kid rock's music to pump me and now it sounds like something that my grandpa listens to. I would have to say that the song i only enjoy on this album is rock on. But i want the old Kid Rock back. I want the man that made devil without a cause, and where you at rock. Simply i want an album that takes kid rock back to his roots the things that made him popular. I love it when he raps and his beats he used and incorporated rock music into them those songs were the best. I want an album that has Kid rock rocking like he used to not one that my grandpa would sit on his porch in his rocking chair and just watch cars pass by. Give me some rock
B001VNB54A|5.0|I just finished watching this 10 part miniseries. This is a very eye-opening & touching retelling of the pacific war. I have read other reviews from people who are comparing this series to band of brothers and they are marking this series down for the wrong reasons. Band of brothers was a great story, but so is this one. If you enjoyed watching Band of Brothers, then you will enjoy this story too. Do yourself a favor and don't get caught up in the reviews from people who want to sit in their homes and talk about how its not as good as band of brothers. After watching this series you will have learned about a dozen or so hero's that made great sacrifices to make this country what it is today,\\"free\\". I can only hope Steven Speilberg and Tom Hanks team up for more great re-tellings of war hero's. This series deserves 5 stars just for the fact that it lets people like us know what others have done to protect our freedom. The story does jump around a tiny bit but its because this series follows a group of men who knew each other but were not together through the majority of the war. The story follows three main characters, John Basalone who was the marines first recipient of the medal of honor, Robert Leckie and Eugene Sledge, who both wrote books about their accounts in the Pacific. I will admit I was a little discouraged about the quality of this series after reading some bad reviews, but after watching it, Im glad I didnt choose not to watch it. Awesome story!!!
B003VANOFY|5.0|Now I know why I like Logitech products so much!  Although I do have a 5.1 speaker system, this headset provides ALL THE SOUND in some of my favorite games.  Full, mind blowing, knock you out of your chair surround sound!  Now I can hear ALL of the combat around me - and know WHERE the action is, just by the direction in the surround sound!    The quality of the materials and construction are superb!  I feel like the \\"priceyness\\" (although not really high, considering what you get) is more than justified.  I feel that I got every penny's worth for my money.  I have been a gamer for over 30 years, going back to the TRS 80, with 16k of memory, and this headset has upped my enjoyment of my games to another level!    The headset is comfortable to wear for extended periods and the range is great.  Gotta take a break from the action?  No problem, you can still talk to your buds even if you go to another floor in the house!    Bottom line:  If you want GREAT 7.1 surround sound for your gaming, a fantastic listening experience for movies and/or music, GET THIS HEADSET!  You won't regret it!
B0041X90ZS|5.0|I'm not typically one who enjoys listening to the live versions of music because most of the time the levels or the mix or sound quality just isn't right and that can seriously detract from my enjoyment of the album. However, I have really enjoyed the last couple of Transatlantic concerts and of course being the huge Neal, Mike and Roine fan that I went ahead and took the plunge for this set.<br /><br />This album was definitely worth the purchase. To not only get the entire Whirlwind performed live, but their best of from the previous two albums was an awesome experience. The sound quality was excellent and you definitely get a sense of what it might have been like to be there (without having to go deaf in the process).<br /><br />For those who have mentioned that the 5.1 sound and low end wasn't captured as effectively as they would have liked, I didn't notice that personally as much but I will admit that as a guitarist, that's generally not where my focus is at when listening. To my ears though, this is some of the best prog talent in the world, all on stage together creating masterpiece after masterpiece and it really just doesn't get much better than that in my book.<br /><br />I'd highly recommend this album, especially if you don't already own one or more of Transatlantic's previous concert releases.
B001E95KVA|3.0|Mr Polak presents us with some strategies to fight poverty as well as proof in the form of one story in particular of a poor Nepalese family who uses low-cost irrigation to increase their income by farming in the dry winter season.  This book could be distilled down to a good TED talk, however, as Mr Polak repeats himself frequently, often without expounding his ideas in any meaningful way.  The points made are sound, however, and as such this book outlines a good ideological platform for those interested in developing world enterprise and design.    To those who argue that Polak is anti-charity, or that he believes the free market will solve anything: you didn't read the book carefully as there no fewer than three places where the author admits that government and charity are necessary in the fight against poverty. This book is titled \\"when traditional approaches fail\\" - not \\" traditional approaches should be completely abandoned.\\" Sure, Polak can get pretty cavalier when characterizing his opponents, and it's a weakness of the book, but it doesn't detract from the validity if his argument, nor does he spend the book trashing NGOs and the like.    Read this if you have the time and are genuinely interested in design for the developing world. Reading about treadle pumps and drip irrigation is really boring if you're not concerned with the repercussions.    One of the big unanswered questions - how to achieve the scalability needed to eradicate poverty - is only touched on briefly in the final pages when Polak dismisses detractors that say off-season growing by larger numbers will bring down prices by countering that the demand will increase as income increases among the poor. But if the only new people who have money to create the demand are growing the vegetables, why would they buy them? I would love to read an economist's critique of Polak's ideas.    Regardless of whether the book is amazing or not, everyone should at least go and find out about Paul Polak, hisideas, his work, and his detractors.
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|Oh my!  What has happened to Kid Rock, the Rock N Roll Jesus?  Born Free is nothing but a pop country/rock album.  There is nothing edgy, attitude fueled, sarcastic or anything!  Just a boring safe top 40 formula style snooze-a-thon.  I know he is about to turn 40 but by the sounds of this album his fans are going to wonder if he's actually turning 70!    Very disappointed.
B0044XV3QY|5.0|Avatar fans rejoyce, this is the ultimate set that is manditory for any Blu-Ray collection. Avatar the highest grossing film of all time was amazing in my opinion, some people do not like the concept or felt it was stupid, I am not going to argue just state that I along with millions others loved Avatar, I thought it was plain amazing and changed the media world. Now they have released a longer extended cut of the film with 16 extra minutes, that are worth it. Some do not think that the extra footage would warrant buying it after buying the bare bones edition, well I bought the bare bones and I traded it in to buy this, It is worth buying this but not just because of the 16 extra minutes but the hours of bonus features, they are actually very immersive and worth watching, 45 minutes of Deleted Scenes and I whish the deleted scenes were finished in editing because I found the deleted scenes to further the story more than the additional footage, anyways the movie was amazing and its still amazing and its made even more amazing with this extended footage. Get the set you wont be disappointed. Stop complaining about not having it in 3D.
1439181780|5.0|I have read \\"The Secret\\" multiple times, and would begin to try and apply the principles to my life, but I always felt like there was something blocking my ability to fully apply it, and the most important part-BELIEVE it! \\"The Power\\" has provided that! It provides a new perspective on the same things that \\"The Secret\\" teaches, but shows it in a new light-by giving LOVE. Just by giving love, I have already found amazing opportunities and happiness just flowing into my life! At first, I was shocked at how quickly it was working...but now it just provides me with even more belief that everything in the universe is based on love. Another thing I found that was very beneficial in this book, was how Rhonda Byrne brought up the idea to stop trying to ignore or force negativity away, as that only multiplies it. This was my biggest obstacle, and now I have overcome it. I was able to do so based on the one simple idea to just let the negativity go, and not to let it bother me. Her example about the \\"bad feelings horse\\" was such a great visual for me! I would completely, 100% recommend this book to anyone who is looking for something benficial in addition to the reading of \\"The Secret\\"!  Thank you for reading, Hope you love the book as much as I do!
B001AXKXBW|5.0|Not only does this album represent Dream Theater's finest album to date (and likely ever with Portnoy having departed the band) but this album is easily one of the finest prog albums to be released since prog's heyday back in the 70s. Most fans of prog, especially prog-metal, view Dream Theater as one of the top 2-3 bands on the scene and they are obviously one of the most commercially successful bands as well. However, I've got a few friends (and I've read a few reviews on this board) who are not as big a fan of them because they feel like DT can get too focused on the licks and runs and the technical stuff and not so much focused on the songwriting and nuances that can make music great.<br /><br />This album goes a long way to proving those criticisms wrong and establishing DT as a force to be reckoned with beyond just their ability to shred. What was originally just a follow up to a single song from their Images and Words album ends up being a masterpiece that has it all. It's a concept album that tells a story. It's a cohesive album with an overture (arguably dream theater's finest instrumental song ever), movements and recurring themes throughout the album. Not only do they bring their trademark shredding and technical prowess, but the song writing is top notch and very powerful and the vocals have never been better. For any prog-metal fan, it just doesn't get much better than this album. Quite frankly, any fan of prog or prog-metal who hasn't heard this yet is missing out on what is essentially Dream Theaters equivalent to Close to Edge for Yes.
B003UHYSIK|5.0|Had never seen this before, and I'm quite glad it was transferred over to DVD. It does retain the original 4:3 aspect ration, but I'm fine with that for the cheap price. Great set, and you get to Slayer perform a few old songs off of Hell Awaits and such. Good video, wonderful reminiscent 90's crappy video effects (love it!), and Slayer is obviously a bit younger and more energetic in this performance. A must have for any real Slayer fan!
0321687299|5.0|This book was a refreshing change from the typical run of the mill technical books.<br /><br />Each section focused on a piece of HTML5 (or related) technology, discussed how it came about, what each browsers support level was and how to use it effectively.  The lighthearted examples and humor go a long way to making this a fun read cover to cover.<br /><br />I've followed Remy Sharp (@rem on Twitter) for ages as he discusses all aspects of web design and mobile computing and this book sums up his and Bruce Lawson's (@brucel on Twitter) combined subject expertise perfectly.<br /><br />Overall great book - I expect to use as a reference many, many times.
B003EV6DBM|3.0|This is about the packaging of the DVDs, not the actual series/episodes/extras. I am a VERY big Dr. Who fan ever since I was 5. So, of course I pre-ordered my copy of the Series 5 DVD as soon as it was available. I had already bought the episodes on iTunes as the season progressed, so I didn't need this DVD for the episodes.  I really bought it to have the extras and continue my collection of Dr. Who DVDs. Every (newer) series in the past has had very interesting and fun packaging to display the DVDs and there's nothing more exciting than opening it up and seeing the whole season waiting for you to watch. When I opened Series 5, however, I immediately noticed packaging damage from shipping. I had paid for the two day shipping so I could get the DVDs the day it was released, but there was a definite puncture mark all the way through the side - more damage than any other of my DVD box sets has received and some are 5 years old! Also, upon opening the series DVD, there is a cover (as always) and the inside folds out like a book. This has kept with Steven Moffat's portrayal of Dr. Who as a dark fairy tale, and I thought it tied in nicely. However, each DVD is held in a hard plastic \\"page\\" and you flip through them like pages of a book. It's a cool idea, and something I've never seen before, but these hard plastic \\"pages\\" are only held together and to the DVD body by ONE piece of tape. SERIOUSLY? One piece of tape? This single piece of tape became dislodged upon the third time I flipped through them to get to an episode. The THIRD time! And it's not like I'm being rough with it - it just came off in my hands. I can only imagine what would happen if people were rough with it ... maybe they should have used duct tape. What a poor design. Cool concept, poor poor execution.    As to the shipping damages from Amazon packages, I could have bought Series 5 of Dr. Who from ANYWHERE but I chose Amazon because I have never had a problem with their shipping. Now I would have paid the extra $10 and got it from BBCAmericaShop, because then maybe it wouldn't be damaged before I get it.    As for the damages after the third time you open it, good luck keeping it together.
B0019X3ZZY|5.0|First and foremost this movie to me is about the awesomeness of Amazon.com and having access to a public forum that encourages reviews. I had never heard of this movie until Amazon.com, and through searching out horror flicks to watch came across it on multiple peoples 'lists' of all-time scary. So, I decided to watch it, me being a bit of a horror 'fan'. I must say also, that alot of the reviews here on this movie, the break-down of this movie, are well thoughtout and added much to the experience of the film, so appreciated.<br /><br />Now let me say that this is definetly not a horror movie, and that it's not at all for the squeemish. If your idea of 'horror-tary' (horror with political/social commentary) falls in the lines of Cannibal Holocaust or I Spit on Your Grave you may like this movie- but, unlike those two, in my opinion, which were more exploitative than thought-provoking, Salo is really a much more deep-rooted mind-affecting movie. Rather than going in detail on the plot, I will just give one of the many layered textured snippets from the movie: Namely the infamous 'chocolate-eating' scene with the blonde.<br /><br />[*Somewhat of a spoiler*]<br />Now, what makes this scene, and the whole movies so intense, not from a horror or image standpoint, is from the layers that are implied and perfectly fitted together in the film. With the blonde, as she is eating the 'chocolate' on the floor, completely naked, with one of the Four Men shouting 'MANGI! MANGI'- the allegory of what's going on is so succinctly demonstrated. First we saw at the beginning of the film this young girl being put on display, with the tale of capture to the delight of her soon-to-be captives. Then this scene, along with the others, and later in the film, when one of the other girls at the table says to 'Eat up, and offer one for Madonna'- symbolizing all the captives basic acquiescence to their plight and their belief that, if they just put up with enough of this, she and the rest of them will get through it. Then at the end, we see her alongside the others, being tortured- that to me is what this movie is all about, in spades, and every way possible: The utter hopelessness and hypocrisy of the human condition. Because, even with all the degredation, even with eating 'chocolate', she is still doomed. The layers of this, for instance, being forced to eat each others 'chocolate', whatever that may be- insults, power, abuse, however minor in society, from bosses, the government, friends, etc, we put up with it. And there is no guarantee that it will lead us to anything, anything at all. That's why this movie is so great, because it is so completely layered, with so many allegories. It reminds me of two other works that I think are masterpieces and that also deal with this 'hopelessness of the condition' genre, Eugene O'Neils, the Iceman Cometh and Alan Moore's Watchmen; two other exercises of futility.<br /><br />What's more, Salo also turns all of whats going on in the movie, back around on the viewer, asking you why you wanted to see the movie. Were you like me, looking for horror? Or were you looking to be disgusted, to be tested to your limits? Were you looking to see the 'grossest movie' ever made? Like the 4 Men at the end, did you like watching people being tortured? Or was it too 'real', too 'disgusting' for you? Was the fake violence too much for you? These are questions the movie asks, powerfully. For the next couple days after watching this, I truly looked at the world differently, and a great sadness, bringing me to tears a couple times on thinking back to the film and then looking at what I saw just in day to day things around me; made me think, alot. All in all, a great film. 5 stars. This is what Art is supposed to do to you.it.

B0040JHXTS|5.0|This is an update:<br />First off, so far I have only bounced around a good chunk of the Houston \\"BOOTLEG\\" disc, a 1080/60p 1:66:1 2.0 PCM Stereo transfer from a 32 year old videotape. And the smile still hasn't left my face. When this tour hit Los Angeles, I had a first row behind the sound board seat at the Fabulous Forum, but didn't make it. I still have the ticket, in a frame.<br />But now I have something that is a rollicking good substitute. Sure, the picture is wanting, and the sound drifts, but this is an E Street Band with joy joy joy down in their hearts. 26 songs, loads of banter, and approxiamately 178 minutes, you really couldn't ask for more.<br />Probably not for the casual, I still don't know the lyrics to BORN IN THE USA fan of the \\"Boss\\", but longtime diehards are going to eat this up.<br />And to think, I still have two discs of video and three cd's of music, not to mention a great bit of packaging \\"folder\\" to peruse, to go.<br />I can't wait!<br /><br />Next up:<br />Bruce and The E Street Band<br />Darkness On The Edge Of Town<br />Live Paramount Theatre 2009<br /><br />No Nils (who wasn't on the original), no Danny (RIP), with Charlie on Organ. This is an E Street Band with the past 32 years on their faces. Shot to reflect the mood, as stark and beautiful as the music being played. One of the finest sets of music committed to film in a long time. I got lost in this!<br />Turn it up...<br /><br />I've only listened to the Darkness remaster once, just to get a feel for it. The initial listen gave my system a nice warm run. I will sit down to critique it later.<br /><br />I'm now on the second disc of The Promise, same thing. I'm just giving it a run through to get a feel for it. So far so good. Different workouts of familiar melodies. Alternate lyrics give it a very different feel. Not sure how it would have gone over 32 years ago, but is a real treat now.<br /><br />I still need to sit down and watch the doc.<br /><br />Haven't gone through the \\"notebook\\" yet, except a cursory glance when looking for the discs. But here is a little hint. If your copy of The Promise came in the folder facing right side up and not quite fitting in it's slot, just turn it 90 degrees and it should slide right in.<br /><br />More later!little hint. If your copy of The Promise came in the folder facing right side up and not quite fitting in it's slot, just turn it 90 degrees and it should slide right in.     More later!
B0032JTV6U|5.0|I pre-ordered this item and had a time line of when i needed to receive it by and it came just on time as expected. Good shopping experience.
B004259BMM|5.0|Yes this new CD is shorter than usual, but the price makes it a great value! But there is the deluxe version with more songs available exclusively at Target.  Even on the shorter CD the songs will not disappoint.  I can't pick a favorite yet (it usually takes me a little bit) but I really like Put You in a Song, You Gonna Fly and Long Hot Summer.  Keith is amazing on the guitar in Georgia Woods.

0439023513|4.0|Overall feeling of the Trilogy... exhausting. Do not begin this if you are not prepared for a story that does not have a happy ending. Action packed for sure and never boring, but sad and unsastisfying. I do beleive that is the point and think the ending is as it should be. Still a great read, but be prepared.

B00428ZRFY|2.0|Barbados native Rihanna has always been the type of (gulp) singer whose fame has constantly exceeded her actual talent and capabilities as an artist. She's the prime example of how good looks and the right amount of sex appeal can get you guaranteed radio play and a contract.     Yes, her music is catchy and infectous, but it doesn't outreach to anything more than that. and with \\"Loud\\" she only just reaffirms it even more. The whole album feels like they threw some generic lyrics on some dance beats and called it a day.     There's nothing here that's going to impact the face of pop music, or would ever leave a mark on pop culture and be remembered years to come. \\"Loud\\" is just a normal fun pop cd you'll wanna listen to while you're out in the club, driving, or just doing some cleaning around the house. It's the type of album you dispose of 5 months later since there's nothing really here with enough UMPH to make you wanna keep coming back and still be listening to it far off into the future.     My guess is that this album is just going to fade into obscurity after a couple months. It's too generic & too bland to have any type of instant catapult that would make it a sure fire trail blazer with staying power.     I think what she should do is just stop getting writers to write songs for her according to whatever fashion mood she's in that month, cause the only outcome we're all left with is a very uncreative and uninspiring end result.     At this point i think i'm actually prefering angry and psychotic Rihanna. We get more out of her that way, Cause now it seems she's crossing over to Katy Perry bubble gum territory,not that she's a stranger to that, but i thought she had got rid of that and found her own sound with \\"Rated R\\"    There really isn't any surprise that this turned out to be a very uninspiring piece of work. She's released 5 consecutive albums every year besides '08 since her debut in 2005. I think maybe what she needs to do is get away for a while, give herself some time to miss the art of being a singer and maybe get a chance to get inspired by other things other than her current hair style.     All in all \\"Loud\\" gets \\"Rated G\\"     For Generic

B002MUAJ2A|5.0|I really liked this book.  It doesn't take long to read cover-to-cover and it's packed with great advice for anyone working in all types of business environments.<br /><br />You might not agree with everything in this book, that's OK.  All of the topics in this book may not apply to you, that's OK too.  The key here, is that out of the many things this book covers there is a really good chance that one or more applies to your situation.  This is where the book is really worth the money.  It will force you to think about things you normally wouldn't and suggest new and innovative ways to deal with the issues you are having in the workplace.<br /><br />I really liked the advice about making decisions quickly, under-doing the competition (and not apologizing for it), and the advice against being a workaholic.<br /><br />This book is build for people who want to make a difference in the workplace and suggests straightforward and interesting ways to handle almost any situation.<br /><br />I'm glad I bought this book and will read it more than once.

B001SO69IY|5.0|I absolutely positively loved it. Its the second BO2 that I purchased because the cd was so tight that I let somebody borrowed it, and never got it back. But I couldnt have Blackout without having Blackout 2. BO2 has the same dank chamber music sound as it predecesor, it's just an extention. Their is no new flavor that anybody adds to the mix. But if you are already a Mef&Red fan, this is perfect for you because you get exactly what you expected. Both of their wordplay is quick-witted,clever, sharp as the WUTANG sword! Fellow Clansmen Ghostface Killah, and Streetlife returns for the sequel. Raekwon the Chefis also featured.Eric Sermon,and Keith Murray from the Def Squad also make guest appearances. Also Bun B from UGK appeares on \\"City lights\\" an ode to the late great Pimp C.GillaHouse emcee Ready Roc is also featured on the album.If you loved Blackout Then I highly recommend Blackout 2. Wutang fans will love this cd trust and believe it's one of my favorite Mef cds.

B002N5N5M0|2.0|*Contains Spoilers*    After waiting with baited breath for each season of Dexter, season 4 was a disappointment.    The great strength in this show was in the writing and the character development. The writer's ability for us to have some empathy and understanding for the serial killer Dexter was what kept me watching. It felt wrong that we should have some sympathy for a heartless killer but we should not be too judgmental of Dexter because we all seem to have our flaws and perhaps even as suggested by the series - the devil inside.    I felt that the core tenet of our view of the Dexter character as someone with redeeming features, his rigid adherence to Harry's Code, was destroyed in this series. Dexter is always so precise and methodical in the stalk and kill, establishing conclusively his victim's guilt. However, Dexter takes little time in determining the photographer as a murderer and the writers did not give his detective colleagues the opportunity to investigate (and fail) before Dexter and the code are called into action. I think in the context of the series and Dexter's placement in Miami PD homicide the investigation of the eventual murderer should have been known to Dexter, but this information is only given by the writer's (the DNA and confession) after Dexter has killed the photographer.     The death of Dexter's previous \\"innocent\\" Oscar Prado in season 3 could be explained away by the don't get caught aspect of the code but the writer's spend so little time on Dexter's investigation into the photographer that we know priorities have changed. He loses any real purpose for those in the community around him. He is no longer a lonely killer on the margins of society killing for what he bizarrely believes is the public good; he is simply a lonely killer on the margins of society. It may be the writer's intention that Dexter would want to learn something from Trinity and \\"grow\\" as his relationship with himself and others changes, but the viewers relationship with him changes as well once we know that the code is not essential to the central character of Dexter and that destroys his credibility in the viewers eyes - I lost interest in him.    Likewise for the other characters, previously the flaws and foibles of the other characters have been explored and they impact upon the main plotline. Not so in my view in this season. Quinn seems to be a poor man's Doakes. There is some friction with Dexter, he views him as an outsider and even starts monitoring his movements and knows he is not who he says he is, but that plotline does not go any further. The money he takes from the crime scene is also not fully explored. Dexter uses is as leverage to attempt to have him back off from himself and Deb, but we never really know why the character made the decision to take the money and become \\"dirty\\". The character of Christine is another example. Like Dexter and Trinity she is a killer and with a series so focused on the why - why the killers act how they do and do what they do, her genesis as a killer is never explained by the writers. We know she is Trinity's daughter, that she shot Deb and Lundy to protect the father, but we never get to know her dark passenger as we do with all the other main characters that kill in this series. The relationship of Batista and LaGuerta also seems inconsequential to the main plotline.    All the episodes seem set up pointing to the final climax between Dexter and Trinity. Dexter's journey towards the climax is an empty one and seems rushed and confused. He's vulnerable and makes mistakes, because he wants to live outside of Harry's code.    The final bath scene with Rita is genuinely shocking from the horrible visual impact. We can assume that Trinity killed Rita but this does not fit within the context of the series as this does not accord with Trinity's own code (remember Trinity is horrified Christine killed Lundy), nor is it for preservation, as Trinity already had a plan to disappear and believed Dexter would be silent. We are left to speculate on the why. Justification or explanation for a death in this series, particularly of an \\"innocent\\" is not given.    Overall maybe the series has run its natural course. I think that there is only so much content for a series about a serial killer preying on killers before it becomes stale or strays beyond the already narrow boundaries of public acceptability. No doubt producers and the rest will want to milk this cash cow for all it's worth, but I think the writing can only degenerate from here on in.

B0040JHXTI|5.0|I've been a Springsteen fan from way back.  Didn't have the good fortune of seeing him on tour prior to the Darkness tour, but growing up in Tucson, I saw the Phoenix and Tucson 1978 shows from this tour, and saw shows on every tour since then (except Tunnel of Love, he didn't come to AZ on that one, dang it).    I've loved every show I saw, but the Darkness shows were simply something special.  The DVD performances alone make this set worth the price of admission.  Having the Houston show, which was just a night or two prior to the Tucson show, in its entirety?  That's just ridiculously cool, and the sound and video are both really good (for what it is).  We are blessed to have the energy of this time captured permanently.      And then the new band performances of Darkness?  Wow.  The energy, the beauty and ferocity of the performances.      This set is a treasure. Get it and enjoy it.
B001NLKT60|5.0|I'll keep it simple:  if you liked the first book this one is an obvious no brainer, as its better in every way.  If the first book left you on the fence, take the plunge with this one, and you wont regret it.  If you didnt like the first book at all, well, why are you reading this review?<br /><br />There is no boring recitation of financial fraud, as in the first book, and there is a single unified plot, rather than two separate plots as in the first book.  It thus requires a lot less boring backstory, and the action, mystery, suspense, whatever you liked from the first book, picks up right away and keeps going.  The main characters from Girl with the Dragon Tatoo are here, and if you liked them there, you'll surely like them here.<br /><br />Last I checked, the first one had 4 stars, and this one had 4.5 stars over thousands of reviews.  I myself think the difference is even bigger than that, but there isnt much point in discussing it in detail.  If you liked the first book, just stop reading reviews and buy the second.

B002N5N5QQ|5.0|I got hooked on Sons of Anarchy with Season 1, and have throughly enjoyed Season 2 as well. I was especially drawn in Season 2 to the emergence of the characters Gemma (played exceedingly well by Katey Sagal) and Tara (played by Maggie Siff). They become more prominent and essential to the storyline, and their evolving relationship is well written and well acted.<br /><br />While many will like this show for the action and bikes, it has a surprisingly good level of character development. I've introduced several people to the show who initially wrote it off (without seeing it) as a trivial biker-gang romp. But, after a few episodes, they become fans.<br /><br />Can't wait for Season 3 to come out!<br /><br />One question for fans. There was an event at Caracara in Season 2 (I won't go into details since I don't want to spoil things) that involved Chucky and Darby. Chucky continues on in the storyline in later episodes. I can't, however, seem to figure out what happened to Darby - he doesn't seem to be mentioned again at all. Did I miss something? If anyone can give me some details on what happened to Darby, please post a comment. I'd appreciate it.
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|On June 22nd, 2010 Cyndi Lauper released in the USA her 11th studio album Memphis Blues, a cover blues album she co-produced with Scott Bomar  and recorded in march 2010 at Electraphonic Studios in Memphis (Tennessee). An album Cyndi had been wanting for eight years and she could finally make, giving her very personal and refined touch to one of the most loved and complex musical genres of all times. Memphis Blues (Naïve-Downtown Records), featuring blues legends as B.B. King, Anne Peebles, Allen Toussaint, Charlie Musselwhite and Johnny Lang, was released in Italy on September 27th, 2010.   The feeling of Memphis Blues is gritty and full of life: \\"This is the album I've wanted to make for years\\" - says Cyndi - who has been choosing with extreme care the beautiful songs of big artists she has been admiring for a lifetime and who taught her how to sing, as Cyndi herself says. It was difficult to pick up only a dozen songs to work on for the album, due to the multiple suggestions from friends and colleagues and the several influences and inspirations she has been evaluating during her musical trip. A trip Cyndi  has also been sharing with her fans via podcasts, twitter and blogging.  The songs choice for this record is pure genius. Cyndi was listening to Memphis Minnie, specifically to \\"You ain't done nothing to me\\", in her hotel room in Memphis all the while she made the album, also driven by Etta James' passion in her \\"I would rather go blind , which is \\"A song with so much feeling and which stopped my heart\\"- says Cyndi. Among the other personalities she chose Ma Rayney's and her \\"Prove that on me, because I thought it took so much courage to come out with that song in a time when women weren't always able to be independent and make their own way in the world, let alone be open about their sexuality. Besides, Ma Rayney's did not invent the blues but she popularized it. Among the others, Big Mama Thornton is another singer Cyndi sang with in her room for years andyears: \\"An innovator who had a sense of rhythm that led a generation of women in rock\\"- Cyndi continues. After Big Mama Thornton, Cyndi was greatly influenced by Charlie Musselwhite and his \\"Fell on my knees\\", an early recording.    In Memphis Blues Cyndi is not on her distinctive lyrical soprano key. She is in a new dimension and in a very personal atmosphere, so deep into this music that while listening to the record we can easily imagine her singing it live in some blues bar in Memphis. And blues really fits her. With her voice she gives this music such an original and personal touch, transforming that - as she herself states - into an uplifting, soothing and encouraging musical expression.  The opening number `Just Your Fool' sets a promising tone with a wonderful interplay that is at times harmonious and at others a battle between Musselwhite's fantastic harmonica work and Cyndi Lauper's distinctive vocals. Other highlights include Toussaint's perfect blues piano on Lauper's cheerful version of `Early in the Morning', originally by Louis Jordan. Here it's just like being in a movie: Cyndi is telling a story and is creating somewhat again the atmosphere of her first videos, like the one for her beloved \\"Girls just wanna have fun\\".  \\"From the moment Allen Toussaint hit the keys in \\"Shattered dreams\\" I knew that we were creating something really special\\"- says Cyndi.   Listen to the involving \\"Romance in the dark\\" and what this song can communicate, even visually: \\"I closed my eyes and I saw Big Maybel in my head smiling and I started to really sing\\". Cyndi definitely learnt and uses Janis Joplin's teaching: \\"It's not the word you have to sing, it's the feeling\\".   Twisting, funny and truly uplifting is \\"Don't cry no more\\", originally from Bobby Blue Bland, one of the major of the modern soul sound.   In \\"Rollin' and Tumblin\\" country blues, a must listen of this album, Cyndi duets with a true Memphis Blues legend, Ann Peebles. Peebles' strong and throaty deep altois serving as the perfect foil for Lauper's trill.  Very refined is \\"Down so low\\", where Cyndi manages several key changes in a multitude of tones and semitones. Other highlights include \\"How blue can you get\\" and \\"Crossroads\\" from Robert Johnson, when Lauper sticks with the traditional guitar based Memphis Blues' sound.  The last track of the CD European version \\"Wild women don't get the blues\\" is a great conclusion for a record answering the question: \\"Is Cyndi Lauper enjoying and fitting with the blues\\"? with a definite yes. A sophisticated rich album to listen to again and again, definitely uplifting!
B002ZG98ZA|5.0|I love , love, love sex in the city, the story line was kind of a no brainer (you knew what was going to happen.) But i have to say the fashion in the movie was fabulous!!!! If your a fan of sex in the city, you must check out the movie, to get your fashion fix, and hot men (Samantha's new guy is ohhh sooo hot) !
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|WTF.  Worse and worse as the years go by.  I can understand wanting to write and cover the whole spectrum of music but don't forget your roots and what made you the star you have become.  I am upset that I purchased this one...(From a fellow Detroiter)  \\"Sorry\\"
B003UBTX72|5.0|I've gained new appreciation for Keith Richards after reading this book.  My previous opinion of the man was limited to the caricature one generally associates with Keith: drugged out, incomprehensible, costumed, 2nd man of The Stones.  No longer.  Seems he is the musical heart of The Stones, and his obsessive passion for music is my main take-away from this book.  Yes, the stories from The Stones' early years are highly entertaining and WAY over the top- he does not disappoint- but the portrait that emerges is of a true artist still infatuated with the guitar after more than 40 years.  It's a revelation and well worth the read.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I don't often leave reviews for movies but this one I really enjoyed when I saw it with my husband last year right before Christmas. I was very impressed with the animation, you can practically see Jim Carrey's eyes starring out from Scrooge's face! I mean talk about very expressive animation! And I've always loved A Christmas Carol for the story, such a wonderful redemption story.     I have to say though that I was very surprised at some parts of this movie. Considering that it was rated PG I wasn't expecting some of the things to be in there that were in there. It had some very disturbing scenes in there that I would not recommend for small children. And while I've added this to our Christmas collection for when we do have kids I'm going to wait for my kids to be a bit older to see this one. But I still enjoyed it very much. Jim Carrey definitely delivered another amazing performance.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Although we are familiar with this story/movie, you must pick up this copy. The graphics are great, and the movie is fun to watch with your kids!
B000MRAAJM|5.0|Love it.    Beautifully photographed!  Beautifully crafted!  Beautifully executed!  Superb!    Now, I'm waiting for \\"Life\\" on blu-ray!!
0316096199|4.0|Just finished this book... found it to be be very good & engaging. Although some here have complained that the author seems to have \\"learned nothing\\" i think those that say that are expecting a lot.  First off, she was just a teen when it happened; second off, after a traumatic event healing is not instant -- it is a long long road. By the end she had gained some insight.  I appreciated the author's subtle humor despite the intense subject matter. Since this does happen to many many women (& men) this is an important subject & I find Sebold to write in a manner that can draw readers of all walks of life in & sustain interest. Well done!
B000IAZPKM|5.0|QUALITY is the name of the game!! In this DVD, it's everywhere: in the music, the staging, the sound, filming... really in about everything!! This is definitely a \\"must have\\" - I already do!!!
076790592X|5.0|This book was a well written. Albom made it an enjoyable read, telling the story of his professor/close friend Morris Schwartz. To me while reading it made you sit back and think about the life lessons Morrie was teaching him, but also teaching others. If the world had more people like Morris Schwartz as a teacher, and Mitch Albom as a student, that take in their lessons on life, this world would be a better place. i recommend this book to anyone who wants to learn to view life outside the box rather than in as society would have it.
B003XKPPOU|5.0|I have seen every Pixar movie and this was the Best one yet. It was funny and sad which makes it great.  My 2 year old Daughter loves it.  I think her favorite character is as she calls him the \\"mean\\" monkey.  As some reviewers have said that it is too scary for their kids.  My daughter is not scared at all.  Not sure what there is to be scared of. Yes there is some Toys being beaten up by kids but what kid does not throw a toy or two.  I think I have watched it with her about 10 times and my wife many more than that as this is now my daughters favorite.  Each time I watch it is gets better.  The jokes are great as well as all the characters.      The end is sad but it is the perfect ending as now the Toys have a new life again and will be played with for years to come by a kid, Bonnie, who loves her Toys as much as Andy did.    Would recommend this movie to all Pixar fans.

B001YYQ9SS|5.0|I absolutely love this Blu Ray disc. I play it on my Playstation 3 and the graphic are amazing. Final Fantasy VII Advent Children Complete adds 30 minutes of new scenes. If you have never watched the blu-ray version, and no matter how many times you have watch the first movie, this blu-ray movie will make you feel as if you are watching it for the first time. I can easily say this is one of, if not the best, purchases I will make all year. If you are a real Final Fantasy VII fan, this should be in your shopping cart.
1439177783|5.0|Portia De Rossi's story of her battle with anorexia was so raw and honest that I could not put it down.  The book begins with Portia getting a role on Ally McBeal and details how her desire to be thin enough for the role spiraled into an out-of-control descent into a dark disease.  Numerous times throughout the book I found myself cringing as she described her self-loathing, her manic exercise routines and her calculated eating habits.    Her story is definitely one that reminds us that no matter how good a person may seem to have it on the outside (fame, money, beauty), we never know what is going on with that person on the inside.  I admire Portia for being brave enough to put her story in writing and to let the world know more about the struggles she faced in her life.
B0036EH3XE|5.0|We love this series so much.
B000002J0B|5.0|Good price, good deal, happy customer!!!
B0034G4P7G|5.0|Not a word or a moment wasted in the entire film. Beautifully and thoughtfully created. Inspiring in ways that I did not expect. Excellent score by Reznor, who is a national treasure. This movie is bigger than the Oscars so it doesn't matter what sort of recognition it receives.    I can understand the misogynistic theme floating around in reviews but I felt like the film is ultimately about the pursuit of a woman, however mislead. The lead character does not know how to relate or cultivate personal feelings. He is young, growing up is a difficult process and the modern world of romance is far away from fairytales and dragon slaying.     Modern love is competitive, intimidating, complex, overpopulated and overwhelming. This is a story about wanting to be man who is desired by women and not knowing exactly how to do it. Facebook and being a billionaire are side effects of the natural loneliness of being a human who wants so desperately to connect yet has no instruction on how to do so.     In the case of MZ he has no problem learning mind bogglingly complex programming languages and algorithms but communicating proficiently with a woman proves much more difficult. The characters dedication to making something of himself seems to be an act of rebellion against his profound ignorance for and anger about his incompetence with intimate communication.    It is interesting to consider that the actual content of facebook, with its virtual screen between who we are and how we want people to see us is arguably a result of the lead character leaping into the unknown armed with an unmatched intelligence and deep fear of intimacy.    Sure facebook is a billion dollar business, but this cinematic masterpiece reveals that it also might just be the 21st century's most powerful work of art.    What brought it into existence? Like so many other things, the world of the woman and the innate desire of man to attract its attention.     Some people are more successful at this than others.     As to whether this is a unique portrayal of MZ's actual life is totally irrelevant. This story has been been happening throughout history and will likely remain on repeat until we find another core reason for self actualization than the pursuit of meaningful relationships.    I only have sympathy for the lead character and I hope that the real person it is based on has come to personally know the value of intimacy through the amazing and trying adventure that is his life.     There is one thing for certain, anyone who sees this should receive the gift of inspiration to do a little less questioning and a lot more of making their ideas happen without looking back.    If MZ has one thing down besides programming its that he does not give any indication that he needs permission from anyone outside of himself to go about his day and neither should you.
B003YWUTJI|5.0|I have been a Norah Jones fan from the beginning, but even for someone who's never heard of her music this is a great CD to check out.  The collection of artists is so varied that I'm sure anyone can find something to suit their tastes.  As always, Norah's voice is beautiful and full of soul.  It's almost haunting.  I highly recommend this along with any of her other albums.<br /><br />I received a free copy of this CD from One2One Network in exchange for my honest opinion.
B003UBTX7C|1.0|Boycott books that cost more than $9.99!!    I love Baldacci, but will get the book from the library, like the old days.    Refuse to buy from these greedy publishers/authors.  It's the only way to be heard.
044654759X|5.0|[[ASIN:044654759X Safe Haven]]    Safe Haven by Nicholas Sparks is a fantastic book.  Nicholas Sparks writings are extremely good.  This is just another of his wonderful stories.
B002SEW5WW|5.0|I heard two songs from their first album: Apologize and Stop and Stare.  They were good songs but two don't make them a good band.  Then I heard All the Right Moves which got me interested.  At least they weren't a \\"two hits wonder\\".  Then I heard Secrets on the radio.  I looked up the album on Amazon and read a few reviews.  I decided to try them out and I'm so glad I did.  I was so impressed with Waking Up, I tried the entire first album: Dreaming Out Loud.  These guys are great.  I placed both albums on repeat and I've been listening to them all week.  Not at all tired of them yet and I think I like every song (my player is also set to random so I wasn't keeping track).
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I've waited for what seems like forever for this album to come out, and with the new producer, I expected something different and exciting for this new piece. Now that I have Josh's album and I'm not disappointed. I listened to the entire album straight through, and like most other Josh Groban fans, I expected a piece that just blew me away, but none did. Puzzled, I listened to the album for most of the day today, and my eyes really began to open.  Sit back, and listen to the lyrics, and the pitches of Groban's voice. Close your eyes and take it all in, for once is not enough for this album.  There are no over lavished pieces, but each piece brings something unique and meaningful to this album.      The best part about this album is that it's practically written by Josh Groban himself. Most of the English songs are written by Josh, and with that, one can tell he put all his effort and passion into each of his songs. This album stripped off all the fluff of the previous albums and fans are just left with Josh, and a light orchestra in the background. His most powerful pieces include Hidden Away, the War at Home, and Higher Window. His foreign pieces are great as well, but Josh's English songs truly shine in this album.    Illuminations is a great piece that doesn't deviate too far away from the Josh Groban we all know and love. One might not be used to the bliss peices right away, but replay them, and soon one will realize the brilliance in each one. Enjoy the album because this album is Josh Groban, and if one is really a fan, they'll love it.
B004259BMM|5.0|This CD is a very good release from Keith Urban. Could be his best since Be Here. My favorite songs on this album are You Gonna Fly and Shut out the Lights. I love how he gets back in touch with the sounds from Be Here. Good job Keith.
0451191153|5.0|Why I loved this book:    -Roark is the ideal human, but is not out of reach to the reader; he is pure of thought and action, meaning he does not use others or steal other's ideas-- everything he does comes from his own creativity and intelligence  -The passionate and sexy relationship between Roark and the woman he loves, Dominique. Dominique is his equal, but she seems to struggle with the fear of others who prey on the rawness of the person who puts their SELF/ideas/creative work out there.  She hides her true self but knows she is good; Roark does not hide and he does deal with more adversity, but he also attains greatness and loved himself even through the dark times.  -All the characters are relateable and interesting.  (Note: this is where Atlas failed me-- the characters were too cold and fake)  -Challenged me to respect my self more, to not be ashamed or think my own ideas suck.    -Challenged me to bring out and strive towards the best I can possibly be.  -Challenged me to not look to others for direction and acceptance, but to find these things within myself and trust my own judgement.
B003V5PPZG|5.0|Wow!  Before this album, I've only known a few good, well known, common songs played on the radio.  After experiencing this album, I looked into their past work and found them to be equally impressive.  The lyrics are great.  The tunes are great.  There are slow songs and there are fast songs.  There are rock your head off your shoulder songs and there are songs that can probably be considered \\"techno\\".  These guys know what they're doing and they're not afraid to try new things.  They are true artists.  They are not here to talk about love and accompany it with some catchy sound just so they can make a few bucks.  I've listened to their music over and over again since A Thousand Suns came out.  They've become one of my favorite bands.
6305013578|5.0|If you are interested in silent movies and science fiction, this is one to own. A hidden gem until I viewed it on TMC, I had to find out how to own a copy!
B0034G4OVS|4.0|This is a \\"disaster\\" flick in that it starts out bad, and then, things get so much worse!  I thought the dialogue, characterization, and acting was above par for an indie flick.  The cinematography was also well done.  This is a great, yet grim, terror ride and if you have a weak stomach you will have a difficult time with some of the realism depicted.  Highly recommend this one!!!
B004259BMM|5.0|The reason this album has only 8 songs is because the industry is trying to figure out buying patterns of the public & the best way to improve sales. Less songs means a cheaper price so hopefully more people will go out & buy the product. Keith recently did an interview on GAC & explained why they released a regular & deluxe version. He just wants to give new & current fans more than one option to buy his music. Either way you won't be disappointed. He always creates amazing work & I highly recommend seeing him live!
B003BKF696|4.0|I love this disc, but it frustrates me that these guys have released an expaned edition of this disc so soon after its initial release. If they had this stuff ready before High Violet's release, why not release the expanded edition then? This is the kind of thing that alienates had core fans.
1442337966|5.0|I found this audio book to be outstanding. It takes the previous book \\"The Secret\\" to a whole new level. I am grateful that Rhona Byrne shared her knowledge of the power. It is definitely worth the cost. I keep the audio book in my car and listen to it regularly, and have found the information contained in the book to be extremely beneficial in providing the knowledge or the road map that leads to living the wonderful life that we all deserve. Being grateful and living in a state of Gratitude is key.

1607050072|5.0|Firstly, this is a lovely book to look through -- filled with sweet illustrations and gorgeous photographs of the projects in use, in addition to the clear diagrams and instructions for making them. Each page is colourful and inviting, and clearly the book has been very thoughtfully and lovingly put together. The book is broken into five sections: the four seasons, and a special section just for Christmas. This works really well.    The projects themselves are also a joy. Some artists find one thing they are good at and never venture any further, but Kajsa has a whole range of skills up her sleeve. You'll find quilting, applique, and all the little stuffed friends you could hope for. Though probably most famous for her wonderful multi-coloured birds, Kajsa also proves she can design great houses, angels, fish, and those special little tomte (Christmas elves) who are lined up by my sewing machine right now. Her take on a baby quilt was beautiful and unusual... no chicks or bunnies here, but a little fox that would be the pride of any nursery. There are definitely things for a beginning sewer to make, such as the stuffed houses and birds, but her quilted baskets would definitely inspire a more experienced sewer, too.     Really, a pleasure to read. Twenty-one projects, and I plan to make them all.
0061714372|4.0|Megadeth recently toured the world with ex bandmates Metallica and colleagues Slayer & Anthrax as the Big Four. A few months earlier before starting touring the world, Mustaine publishes his autobiography. The Highlights are in the way he describes his fight against drug addiction and the frustration of being fired form Metallica - a wound that clearly isn't healed yet-. The dissapointing chapter here is the one that about the Black Magic stint, suppossed to be one of the attractions of this book. Mustaine owe me some money ¡¡¡
B0044XV3QY|4.0|The extended parts really worth it.  It is still a bit too long on the war/assault section and should have been shorten down at many times but overall the new adding are actually beneficial for the story line.  The opening finally makes sense and the addition are backing up part of the background characters.    Extras are great, especially if you interested in the development process of the movie.  I feel sorry for those who bought the previous releases, I had the chance to buy that one first and it is a real treat.    James Cameron master piece without a doubt.
0230706169|5.0|I began reading Baldacci over the summer.  First, Absolute Power, a stand alone novel.  Then I picked up The Camel Club and flew through the series.  Just amazing characters and plots.  You can't help but jump on board with this rag-tag group.  Anyway, I read through The Camel Club, The Collectors, Stone Cold, Divine Justice, and now just finished Hell's Corner. My opinion is that this book is great, deserving of 5 stars, but it has the task of trying to live up to the prior works and Baldacci set the bar high.  I would rate this right in the middle of the pack as far as the series goes but that's still saying a lot.  Definitely would recommend this book.  I can't wait for the next book in the series and it's dissapointing to think that it is probably 2-3 years off in time.  Oh well.
B0032JTV6U|4.0|So, like most people, when I originally heard about Glee, I was skeptical.  I mean, a musical tv show??  I didn't watch a single episode of the first season when they were originally aired.<br />But, I came across a great deal via Amazon to pick up season 1 on dvd and I had some gift cards burning a hole in my pocket, so I picked it up.  I've watched the entire season FIVE times in a row.  I LOVE it.  My husband, who hates all things musical related, has even started watching it...<br />I think it's absolutely hilarious.  I don't recommend it for kids or even tweens due to some of the subject matter... but for anyone old enough to remember who \\"Marky Mark and the funky bunch\\" is...  pick it up.
B00371QQ0M|3.0|I originally saw \\"Dune\\" many years ago, in the late 1980s, as a network television broadcast.  I understand that this is the Alan Smithee version which was not approved by David Lynch.  Nonetheless, the \\"extended version\\" as shown on TV included some important scenes not seen in the 137 minute DVD & Blu-Ray editions.  Chief among these is the knife fight between Paul Atreides and Jamis (the Fremen).  It's a critical look into Fremen society and the martial rules of honor that guide them.  Fans of the book will also recognize it as a key step in the psychological and social development of the character Paul Atreides.  Otherwise this version of the film is very good.  Any limitations in the image quality of the Blu-Ray I would attribute to the age of the source material.  I do have some criticisms of the the scenes during the Harkonnen attack on Arrakis (at the beginning of the film) and the Fremen assault on the Emperor's frigate (at the end of the film).  The action is a bit a choppy.  It seems obvious that some portions were cut out (without finesse).  So there are a few scenes that just don't flow smoothly together.  It's probably not a problem for fans who have not seen the extended TV version.    The \\"Deleted Scenes\\" bonus feature is quite welcome.  Raffaella De Laurentiis explains that the raw footage encompassed about four hours of video.  Of course, this is simply too much for a movie feature.  Even a raw glimpse into the deleted scenes will show us that the film tried to remain true to the novel upon which it was based.  Fans of the book will recognize all of the deleted scenes.  It's a pity that an uncut version was never produced.  Given the flexibility of the Blu-Ray format, it would have been nice to see multiple versions of the film (even if it required a multi-disc release; I would have paid extra).    R.I.P. Dino De Laurentiis
B0043A0PXU|5.0|Annie Lennox - such an icon - and she does not disappoint.    This album is a fantastic addition to the mundane and overplayed Christmas music currently played on music stations. Ms. Lennox offers a new perspective on traditional tunes that is both refreshing and invigorating. Her powerful vocals are clear, gorgeous and distinctive. She could not have chosen more perfectly suited songs for both her voice and style.    I am playing this album over and over and have yet to find anything to be disappointed with. She is an angel on earth with an amazing voice!
B0038M2AZA|5.0|Crossing the Atlantic and clicking on to this movie at 41,000 feet was a gift . It made me see through so many passages of my life from the time I can remember.   I had little comfort as a youth trying to get through school.It was very difficult for me to sit down and focus on writing exams. I thought too quickly and couldn't put my thoughts into words. I could talk about everything I studied but I couldn't write about it. it was frustrating and embarassing and humiliating. I did get through it all though and graduated from University with a degree in Finance.    I admire the director for his ability to make me understand more about autism. i never understood it until now . Thank you. The main protagonist Temple deserves an award for her talent and courage in performing the way she did with such love in wanting to carry forth the message of this story. I am a great hugger by the way and I know how positive it is to be that way, even though I have been too often called an octopus.  I hope to feel as good as I do since I watched the movie for a long time. I am going to help the cause of autism because I watched this movie.  Thank you .    Albert
B00428ZRFE|5.0|I really like Rihanna's new album Loud. She keeps getting stronger, and better with each release. I'm surprised she already has a new album out, because Rated R was released a year ago, time sure goes by. It's a good thing that she came out with a new album this year, instead of waiting 2 years. You may have thought Rated R could of only been her stunning maturing sound, but it's not. She turns it up louder on Loud. As of now she is one of my favorite singers. This album is going to be a big seller, which she always has been. This is one of my favorite albums of 2010. My favorite songs on Loud are:<br />1. What's my Name Feat. Drake<br />2. Fading<br />3. Raining Men Feat. Nicki Minaj Play this song really loud in your car.<br />4. Skin<br />5. Love The Way You Lie Part 2 Feat. Eminem
B003HTPHSQ|5.0|I am not a big Cyndi Lauper fan but this is a fantastic cd.  I heard snippets of it and decided to take the chance and order it.  I am glad I did.  I never expected this genre of music from her and she is great.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|I took my daughter to see this movie in the theater last year. I was so pleasently surprised that Disney actually stuck to the original story with this film. It held all the humor AND the darkness of the book. Be aware that as this does follow the book, it may not be appropriate for small children. Dickens can be very dark, and scary for young ones.
B003Y7L5W8|5.0|I must admit I was more than a little worried when I heard that OMD were going to release a new album. I was quite happy when the miracle of the band reforming took place and they toured successfully playing their old stuff....safe ground, but a new album? OMD, the band of my youth, the band I grew up loving, OMD, the first concert I took my wife-to-be to, OMD, the band that I loved to listen to, even on the 90's when they had gone out of fashion. OMD, the band who's lead singer Andy McCluskey I had based my 80's haircut on. I am sure you get the idea, no, what I was nervous about the most was a new album dashing all of those fabulous memories of my formative years by being a shadow of their former selves........need I have worried so much? NOT ON YOUR LIFE, the album is a fantastic reflection on the early years.....no it's more than that, it is simply an EXTENSION of the early years with a modern twist, I love it!!
B002ZG981E|5.0|On the surface Inception seems to be a crime caper, complete with master of disguise Eames (Tom Hardy), planner Aridane (Ellen Page), point man Arthur (Joseph Gordon-Levitt), and master thief Cobb (Leonardo DiCaprio). But it's so much more than that, taking place in dreams within dreams within dreams.<br /><br />Inception, like Total Recall and The Matrix, is about perception.  The audience is never sure what reality is because the protagonist isn't sure what's real. There are clues providing evidence for the real/not real theories, but the best movies of this type don't come down on one side or another.  Total Recall ultimately had enough clues indicating the \\"right\\" way.  The Matrix stumbled after it made it clear that reality was fiction, thereby losing an audience who enjoyed the tantalizing mystery.  Like so many mysteries, once the truth was revealed it wasn't quite as exciting as we all hoped. Inception wisely avoids providing answers.<br /><br />Inception is also a thought experiment.  The central conceit of Inception is that once you put a thought in someone's head it's like a virus, incapable of being removed.  In fact, attempting to not think about the idea causes the mind to just focus on it more.  This concept, a key tenet of neuro-linguistic programming (NLP), is part of how our brains are wired.  Director Chris Nolan knows exactly what he's doing when the characters explain the premise.  It is the key argument between Cobb and his wife Mal (Marion Cotillard): is this life just a dream?<br /><br />Once you get it into your head as to which of them is right, Inception burrows into your psyche and you see all the evidence you need to reinforce the idea.  There are enough discrepancies to suspect that Cobb's stuck in a dream, but there are enough rules defining reality that indicate otherwise.  Unless, of course, you believe that Cobb is fooling himself by making up said rules to convince himself he's not in a dream when he actually is.  If that sounds confusing, Inception's done its job.<br /><br />Inception is a little too long in places, testing the viewer's patience as it delves four levels deep into the subconscious, each with different timeframes, settings, and plots. Part of the fun is watching the movie again to look for clues that reinforce what we secretly thought we knew all along.<br /><br />Me?  I'm convinced I know the truth.  But then maybe Inception put that idea in my head.done its job.

1594481717|1.0|I was expecting a little depth of the Subconcious mind and what it can do to benefit you... This book is basically telling you that we have a Subconcious Mind that is creative and imaginative... ya think?      Trust me... go read Psycho-Cybernetics or Think and Grow Rich and save yourself the trouble.      This book is now a colorful coaster for me, and its not even good at that!
B003L20ICE|3.0|Interesting to read all the reviews not only here on this space but in the media across the country raving about this film as being one of the best comedies of the year. After waiting until it came out on DVD, expecting something spectacular, this viewer found the film disappointing. Writer/Director Lisa Cholodenko and writer Stuart Blumberg did not use the book by the same name as their source for the story, but rather turned to Cholodenko's personal experience with the topic at hand and though it was many years in 'gestation', the movie was shot in an unprecedented 23 days. So much for background.<br /><br />Nic (Annette Bening) is a hard working obsessive compulsive physician partnered with Jules (Julianne Moore), a free-floating, indecisive, career-frustrated landscape designer. The have two children - Joni (Mia Wasikowska) birthed by Nic and Laser (John Hutchenson) birthed by Jules - by the same sperm donor, Paul (Mark Ruffalo). There are the usual family tensions but the quartet seems fine until Joni and Laser decide they want to know their father. They uncover Paul who is into organic food delivery service and relate to him and he to them. When Nic and Jules discover the mission their kids have been on they feel their family has been disrupted. Further developments occur that drive the wedge between the moms close to dissolution but of course that is overcome by the coming together of Joni's leaving for college.<br /><br />All this could be OK, but for this viewer the prejudices about same sex marriage are not championed but instead are placed in a negative light. Infidelity is just that and the problems don't stop there: offensive racial slurs occur when the embarrassed Jules fires gardener Luis (Joaqu&iacute;n Garrido) for no reason and Paul's idea of a family man excludes the possibility of marrying the very beautiful African American Tanya (Yaya DaCosta), etc. The crisis of the story should not be shared as it is the only quasi-surprise in the film - and even that seems like a put down to the position of women. Bening and Moore look old, tired and crotchety but give good performances to the characters as they are written. Ruffalo is being touted as an Oscar nominee for his role, but the role is a mirror of all his other work. If there are winners here they are Wasikowski and Hutchenson - fresh and credible. Great expectations, minimal return. Grady Harp, November 10a put down to the position of women.

B0016OMFPW|5.0|I listen to this album so often that I wake with the tunes in my head. All the songs are great except the last track (bring it home). which I have removed from my plalist. Rarely do I find an album that I find so many of the tracks so pleasing.<br /><br />Balanced: It is not all striving solos, which tend to excite one's nervous system with adrenaline, like you might find with McCoy Tyner's \\"Inner Voices\\" or \\"Horizon.\\" Nor is it all mellow but a nice balance. It is also a nice balance of pushing forward the cutting edge of jazz, as in pioneering new note combinations and chord progressions, and the familiar. It is challenging, but not too challenging. The tunes are arranged well on the disc; it chills you down, then brings you up, again keeping a nice balance.<br /><br />This is a great album for playing during creativity, writing, at work productivity etc.<br /><br />Jazz For Massage: A few of the tunes would work on a \\"jazz for massage\\" playlist, which you can find by listening to the samples above. Other great jazz tunes for massage would be, \\"naima\\" by John Coltrane, \\"Norwegian Wood\\" by Herbie Hancock's version on The New Standard, \\"Chamber Jazz\\" the album by Paquito D' Rivera, and \\"Tell Me A Bedtime Story\\" not the one on Herbie Hancock's Fat Albert album but the version on the album \\"Fingerpainting.\\"<br /><br />Which brings me to another recommendation. \\"Fingerpainting,\\" is another brilliant album that Roy Hargrove plays on. I am fascinated by how much the trio does without drums, which is called Chamber Jazz. Christian McBride and Mark Whitfield make up the trio with Roy Hargrove.<br /><br />If you like the striving, cutting edge but still pleasant sort of Jazz, Earfood offers a few tracks and I would also recommend everything by Dave Holland, David Gilmore, Terence Blanchard's album Bounce, Horace Silver's Hardbop Grandpop, Ellis Marsails' album Whistle Stop, Art Blakey's \\"Album Of The Year\\" which featured a young Wynton and Branford Marsalis.
0374158460|2.0|I generally would not keep reading a book that I didn't like -- but in this case my book club was going to discuss it so I kept slogging through.  I am completely bewildered by the glowing reviews \\"best novel in 30 years\\", etc. etc.  What have these people been reading?  The characters in this book are a shallow bunch of very unlikeable people -- there wasn't one I cared about even a tiny bit.  And what was funny?  I can't remember laughing out loud at anything in the book.  The one thing that did make me laugh out loud was from someone who said that 300 pages into the book he really wanted to \\"leave it on the bus.\\"  And like that same reviewer, I'm terribly relieved to be finished with \\"Freedom.\\"
B0040QYROA|5.0|On 7 November 2010, Turner Classic Movies had a preview showing of the new 2010 restoration of the movie \\"Metropolis,\\" along with a showing of the documentary of the discovery of the Argentine print in 2008. I unfortunately missed the first 20 minutes, and came in around the scene at Joh Fredersen's office at the New Tower of Babel. Also, from owning the 2002 version, there did not appear to be any major lost footage there (and if there was, they did not place the text boxes describing it). From this point on, however...<br /><br />WHAT A HUGE DIFFERENCE!<br /><br />The film actually makes sense! There are little shots interspersed here and there that explain confusing scenes (for example, Josaphat's story in Part III actually has a proper resolution) and the editing is much easier to follow than the 2002 version since you don't have to stop and imagine what is happening, and especially an old Macaday Video release I have which makes no sense, and weird re-editing of scenes creates terrible juxtapositions and headache inducing plot holes, not to mention the fact that the manipulated newsreel footage from \\"Citizen Kane,\\" which infuriated everyone who saw the movie in 1942, looks much better than that transfer.<br /><br />No real explanation of the plot of the film needs to be given, as it has been reiterated many times over on Amazon reviews, and assumptions made by historians about the pace and plot of the original 153 minute version of \\"Metropolis\\" are astoundingly correct, even down to the editing of lost scenes, which matches the 2002 text boxes almost exactly with the additional correction. Certain aspects are clarified a bit more. Examples of this clarification include the sermon scenes in the Cathedral and Freder's bed which show an illustration of the Whore of Babylon depicted as the Machine-Man is on the back of the dragon, and also we see exactly how the Seven Deadly Sins enter the nightclub,.<br /><br />Among the major new scenes are the introduction of Hel at Rotwang's house, 11811 at Yoshiwara, the Thin Man tailing 11811 and kidnapping him, Freder and the Thin Man at Josaphat's apartment, the destruction of the M-Machine, Freder's delusion in its entirety, the destruction of the Workers' City, expanded chase sequences at the end, and a plethora of new establishing and motif shots.<br /><br />At least two scenes are missing, due to degraded film quality from improper storage causing them to be destroyed; these are Rotwang and Joh Fredersen's fight leading to Maria's escape, and the sermon scene in the Cathedral in Part II, although a still of the Bible page explaining the Whore of Babylon is kept. The new version is about 147 minutes, meaning that even with these two small scenes gone, the film is essentially complete.<br /><br />The quality of the film varies wildly, and while in the 2002 version you can somewhat tell if one section was transfered from a higher or lower quality stock, and all of this footage is kept as well, but the new footage is easily discernable. The quality, to say the least, is deplorable. A layer of scratches covers it so much that no restoration could possibly remove it. It also has a lower contrast and can appear a bit fuzzy. Also, since it was found on a 16mm reduction of the original 35mm negative, some of the edges are cropped off a bit, and this is easily noticeable as black boxes surround the footage since it is not the same area as the already restored footage. I greatly applaud the F.W. Murnau Stiftung for their attempts to restore this footage to a level that is viewable, and thankfully although you have to adjust to the lower quality, it is surprisingly clean if you compare it to the unrestored footage as seen in the documentary.<br /><br />I wish to make a correction from my original review:<br /><br />The documentary I originally discussed was a TCM exclusive, and NOT the one featured on the DVD release. I have not yet seen then DVD documentary (about the complete history of themovie up until this release), but I find it a crying shame that the documentary about its rediscovery was not included as it provides many insights into the entire process. An interview with the director of the Museo del Cine, Buenos Aires is included, and she discusses the details of the history of the Argentine print, which is is nice though.<br /><br />As with the 2002 version, the original Gottfried Huppertz score is retained in its entirety, but astute viewers can tell that the orchestration is completely different as it was completed by someone other than Berndt Heller (the orchestrator and conductor for the 2002 version) and although I prefer his version, it is nice to hear the score with all the missing sections kept in. I personally consider this score to be the greatest of all silent film scores, even better than Carl Davis's restored scores, all of which I consider to be fantastic.<br /><br />Any fan of Metropolis DEFINITELY HAS TO GET THIS VERSION, as it is the ONLY possible version of the film worth owning now (owners of the 2002 version should still keep it, as I do not know if its special features are retained here), and all can rest easily knowing that the original version can be seen in its (almost) entirety with little worry about how confusing it is.

B003ZHQVJO|2.0|Gotta be honest, I bought this album hoping for more of the angry Kid Rock I saw in Rock N Roll Jesus...  Sadly, this album lacks anything close to the aggression I loved about his last album.  This album is a blues filled romp through middle America without any of the a$$ kicking that I look for from Kid Rock.  I appreciate his maturing and exploring more musical styles, but I need him to have another terrible break-up to inspire songs like So Hott, Sugar, and Half Your Age...  Get rid of this blues crooner and bring back the Rock n Roll Jesus!!!
B003PIUBZS|5.0|This was an excellent DVD set of one of the best new shows on TV. The layout is very professional and the quality of the materials used to put it together show that it was built to last many years of shelfwear. Big thank you to the DVD designers for not going spartan on the materials.
B003NFM3JU|5.0|Awsome 3D effects,great clarity/bright,sound is exellent. Can't wait for Avitar which in my opinion was blurry and dark in 3D at the theater,but still good. 1080p will be much better.
B0034G4OVS|4.0|Film: ****<br />DVD Extras *****<br /><br />I thought this was going to be your average B-movie, and I love B-movies. Although at times it felt like a feature-length very special episode of \\"I Shouldn't Be Alive,\\" I admired the filmmakers' premise and their determination to make a (literally) chilling movie. The three young leads, especially Parker, acted their parts credibly and with realism. There was quite a bit of existential dialogue and relationship discussions, but when you're freezing to death on top of a ski lift and death is all around, life gets reduced to its essentials. Survival, connection, love. Dan, his girlfriend Parker and \\"third wheel\\" buddy Joe lynch are the unlikely trio that must survive being stranded on a chair lift after the entire ski mountain shuts down for the weekend. It's \\"Wind chill\\" on a ski lift, with ominous atmospheric music, creaking ski equipment and a treatise on the perils of smoking.<br /><br />And, of course, there are wolves.<br /><br />I did find an \\"Easter Egg\\" in one of the DVD menus, and enjoyed the commentaries as well as a real-life \\"ghost story\\" on set.
B001P3SA94|5.0|I'm still surprised at how sexy not-your-typical-leading-man Adrian Brody is.  I would actually push George Clooney aside to meet Adrian!  So Cadillac Records was a yummy sensual feast, plus being a really good movie and representation of an era of rock-n-roll's heyday.  If you like rock-n-roll history, you'll enjoy it. If you lust Adrian...you'll LOVE it!
B0041CGOZS|5.0|The product was in mint condition as stated. Received in a timely manner. Thanks again. Saw Bon Jovi In April 2010 Ft lauderdale Fl and we head to the RDU concert in Feb 2011.

B0041OOJNU|5.0|Shakira's albums are always a wonderful surprise. She recreates herself every time! Sale el sol brings old and new influences, going from a \\"¿Dónde están los ladrones?\\" style to a new, much more latin and creative side. I love Shakira, and I love this album!
0920668364|5.0|This is by far the most touching, endearing, heart-felt children's book ever. I remember reading it as a child and my mother recently bought a copy for me - and boy did I cry while reading it. Very powerful and emotional, it is a true and delicate take on the cycle of life that only a brilliant writer like Munsch could pull off. Perhaps some may find it harsh, but it's not. The bond between mother and son, child and parent, is expressed with beauty and passion. If you have not shared this book with your child, don't wait. Do yourself and your child a big favor and don't hesitate to feel the incredible talent that is Munsch. This book will mean something to you and your child, and like it did with me, I will bet it stays in your hearts forever.
1439163146|5.0|James Franco can write. Some really good short stories in this book, and some really really really good ones. Beware though, this isn't bunny rabbits and rainbows, this is Bukowski, this is Kerouac, this is Thompson, this is some great stuff. Enjoy this book with a nice warm spliff and some whiskey.
B0043A0PXU|4.0|I watched a really fantastic video of Annie's \\"God Rest Ye Merry Gentlemen\\" from an AOL link. That's how I learned of this CD and it's what spurned me to buy it. I was hoping that video would be included, especially since the CD cover is taken directly from it but NO! The video complements the CD perfectly. It's really good in a strange hypnotic, surrealistic way. I've noticed these days some artists will include one if they have it. The Stones, Johnny Cash, Chris Issak, etc have one. How bout it, Annie?
B001OQCV6K|5.0|I like \\"Sherlock Holmes\\" and I'm waiting for the next one to come out. Yes, they took liberty with the character but I've seen worse in the past. I bought this in Blue-ray which gave a great picture. Robert Downey Jr did a great job playing Holmes.
B0042JTDXK|5.0|I have listened to the album just a few times. Sometimes I need to hear a new song a few times before I really appreciate how talented this guy is. Each time you hear that clear voice and the magical lyrics he sings, the albums gets better and better. Can't wait to see him get the recognition he deserves. Love the new album.
B0019CSXAM|5.0|Season 3 doesn't fail to deliver. Just as funny as ever! This show is the most clever comedy on television. Love it!
B004BC7MRM|5.0|This album goes into southern rock and leaves the rap/hip-hop behind. I have always been a fan of Kid and this seems to be his new style. Don't get me wrong I love the new album but sometimes I wish he would go back to that Devil Without a Cause flavor. Keep the music going Kid!
B003TML0VO|5.0|Great CD, the music Is great. Santana does it again. Was not happy with the dealer I purchased it from. The jewel case was cracked and it took for ever to get. Will use someone else next time.
0312360258|5.0|This series will keep your head reeling with questions I am dieing for the 8th one to come out so I may continue the story. I conciser this series a must read for anyone who likes vampires or adventure or even magic. This series is not without its wacky point as each story has but when reading remember that a mother and her daughter wrote this together as a team and I would never say the things in this book to my mother. They are a good team there is just enough teen stuff for you to believe the setting and cast are in fact high school students. Remember there is magic and danger in these stories I would not recommend these books to anyone who is unaware of sex or related activities. I hope these stories with captivate you as they have done to my entire house. The plot is good and I was not big into reading till this series now I can't stop. They opened me to a new world that exists with my own mind. I hope you enjoy these books as much as me
B003ZK58WM|3.0|This was a slow read but he is a master of character development which is what holds my interest. However, I cannot understand why he feels the need to insert such unrealistic and graphic sex into his novels. I'm no prude but he seems almost preoccupied with the subject. It almost keeps me from reading another one of his books.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|This album is not out for one Kid Rock Fan, but instead for all the rest of the music world( Britney Spears lovers I m talking to you). Yes that is how bad this album is, there is a Kid singing but No Rock at all. This has got to be one of the worst things to actually witness with your ears, hearing track after track that Kid Rock... that one artist you never thought would sellout actually gives his career away. Now with that said here is my review, From the first track (born free) all the way through to the last track (for the first time in a long time), Bob just loses you. You never really get the feel for what the hell he is actually going for. Instead sounds like he has the industry whispering in his ears to make it more this way or that. The old Kid Rock flow is finally completely lost with this new release and if this is any sign of the future.. so will the name Kid Rock!     This album goes under the country genre and should be labeled under the name Bob Ritchie. If your deciding what to get your grand parents for there Birthday or Christmas look no further. Give it a couple weeks and you will have people you never in your life expected to talk about Kid Rock doing just that. From track to track you just cannot get into this album I have listened to it in its entirety three times, and now I find myself skipping all the way through the album just looking for one song that has a memorable feel to it. Its not there just the same song over and over again. So for all you True Kid Rock fans out there the ones like me that own every album to date, I say this please do not buy this. Let him know that the faithful will not just buy it because it says Kid Rock, no one said it better the Kid himself(If it looks good, youll see it. If it sounds good, you'll hear it. IF ITS MARKETED RIGHT, YOU'LL BUY IT!) Thats exactly what they are hoping for with this release.     ONE MORE TIME DO NOT BUY! Wait for it to show up in the multiple bargain bins period!     Oh yeah let me know when this gets over 5 decibals lol.
0375805613|3.0|This book was about 1/16th the size I expected it to be. It's very much a baby-sized handheld book. I've seen this (much bigger) in stores and that's what I expected when I ordered.<br /><br />Size aside, this is a cute story.
B0043A0PXU|5.0|The amazing, ever-artistic Annie Lennox presents us with a whole new take on traditional Christmas songs. Unique harmonies, strikingly evocative production, and a musical homage to both Merry Olde England and to the pagan roots of Yuletide. Aside from the use of pre-Christianity instruments that harken back to winter solstice festivals, the song selection is unapologetically Christ-related. There's not a snow man,a pumpkin pie, or a gift-wrapped present in sight. Yet, being the abstract, right-brained artist that she is, Christ comes across as a glorious, non-religious idea for humanity, a concept that everyone can strive for. It's all tied-up nicely with \\"Universal Child\\". \\"Cornucopia\\" is different. Perhaps not everyone's cup of grog, but I love it! Annie's vocals venture out to the classical/operatic side for this material, but she's also surrounded by the ethereal, pristine soprano counter-melodies we've come to expect from her.<br /><br />This review is not just the accolade of a fan. Nor am I religious nor remotely a fan of the \\"holiday season\\". I crawl to the happy day when December 26th arrives. But good music helps. If I hadn't totally fallen for \\"Cornucopia\\", I would say so, or not write anything at all. I'm loathe now to admit I was even tempted to forgo purchasing it altogether. It's my humble opinion that one and two-star reviews for \\"A Christmas Cornucopia\\" are either written by listeners whose hearing is going, have terrible sound equiptment, or have only listened to samples on their PC's.
B003ZHQVJO|1.0|If there's ever a time Kid Rock has truly sold out , it is right now. The old Kid Rock is dead and gone. There's not one hard rock song on this album and it is one of the blandest albums of the year to be honest.    The once heavy metal funk rap rocker has no rapping, no funk, and nothing hardcore here. Ballads are fine but he can't even pull a good one off on this album except for the track \\"Care' which is the only keeper on this album. Other wise this a sappy ballad album that trys to appeal to pop country fans. And he thinks Aerosmith is a sellout, what a joke.    I own all the albums to this point, but I won't be buying this album it is truly terrible. Go back to the old sound.
0312370849|2.0|The book wasn't horrible, but it wasn't really anything special either. The relationships weren't developed enough, the writing style is pretty choppy and you have a hard time relating to the characters.
B004B4JGHE|5.0|As I logged in this morning and hit the buy now buttons to get immediate gratification (and immediate download of this album) I noticed some other comments that expressed displeasure with the quantity of music in/on this album.  At just over 30 minutes, I would acknowledge that it's a scant collection, or at least that in having just 8 tunes it's not a lot of quantity, but I think it's more important to have good quality over having a collection that is padded with a bunch of filler.  My daughter and I were discussing just that yesterday, as I tried to remind myself to go online last night (at the end of a log day) which I failed to do (because of that long day) to buy the album.  She and I both agreed that we would rather have the higher quality, even if it left us wanting more music to come out soon.<br /><br />It seems that the current trend is one where artists (such as Blake Shelton with [[ASIN:B003TTZT5K All About Tonight]]) release shorter albums with fewer cuts/tracks on them and then get back to work on getting the next album ready for release in a relatively short time span.  Doing so allows the artists to keep themselves current and fresh in the public's mind, and also gives them multiple opportunities to dip into customer's pockets to get paid for their work.  That's part of the beauty of the system we have, and I actually appreciate that.  Again, as long as the work is of sufficient quality, I'll happily buy the smaller collection (assuming it was priced fairly) and be ready to buy more later.<br /><br />Just to drive the point home one more time, it's the songs, and the songs in this album are very good.  The current radio rotation (at the time I write this) tune Put You in a Song is one that is just plain fun to listen to, and really the rest of the collection is just as good.<br /><br />One item of note - if you are a user of the i-type products you should be aware that the \\"+Digital Booklet\\" will not appear in your music collection, instead, if you buy the version here you'll have an e-book added to your library and will need to look there (assuming you select it to sync to your device) for the digital booklet.  I wish that the intregration was better in this area, but the pricing was better for this version as opposed to places where one might obtain other tunes, so living with that constraint isn't that tough.<br /><br />As I've tended to say lately, sample the tracks and see for yourself what you think of this album.  Worst case, you can buy the individual tracks that you like, best case you get 8 tracks at what most people would acknowledge is a pretty fair price.'ll have an e-book added to your library and will need to look there (assuming you select it to sync to your device) for the digital booklet.

B003YWUTJI|5.0|Norah did a great job collaborating with various voice talents for this album! You still get her soulful voice, but she pairs with the likes of celebs like Dolly Parton, Herbie Hancock, and the Foo Fighters that seems to up the ante just a bit! The songs are recognizable too! So even if you don't know Norah on a personal level (yet), you can at least be able to sing and dance to the songs you know by heart! My only regret is that there are only 18 songs - I wish it'd go on forever!
B002BSHXJA|5.0|Those who paid 100 more $ for this LIMITED edition of an outstanding artistic and sonic acomplishment I asume have embraced comunism by now... There are also some who looked for a bargain and were given chinese for japanese, and they complained and were replied: \\"Man, you get what you pay for\\". So I conclude the Beatles are worth one half in 2010 than they were in 2009... Time forgives nobody.
B001UV4XWY|5.0|THE BOX is a masterpiece of ethical and moral dilemma masquerading as an ominous sci-fi suspense thriller. It may seem obscure and incomprehensible, but it's essentially just a story about the Golden Rule: What we do to others we do to ourselves.  The story is taken form an ironic little gem of a story by Richard Matheson (of TWILIGHT ZONE fame) called \\"Button, Button.\\" The movie expands it into a Gordian Knot of obscure, seemingly unrelated events that inevitably, well... you'll see.  The central theme is altruism, which is basically the practical application of the Golden Rule (you know, do unto others as you would have them do unto you). The basic equation is that if enough people choose selfishness, eventually no one will be left. Yet I'm amazed by all the diverse interpretations and reviews, especially since the substance of the story is clearly stated at one point as the \\"altruism coefficient,\\" that is, unless people learn to be altruistic they will either destroy each other or be destroyed by the mysterious extraterrestrials. A not uncommon sci-fi theme, but presented here as a brilliantly enigmatic and ominous fable that is never boring, but rather, perplexing and mesmerizing. It may have been more popular as a dark comedy, but then it would have lost much of its impact.   Unfortunately however, when a story is presented as enigmatically as this, people tend to see what they want to see, like the reviewer who totally misinterpreted it as a \\"scathing attack on altruism,\\" quoting Ayn Rand's absurd, distorted definition of it. (Ayn Rand, the master of rationalization of the selfish and self-serving, nursed a lifelong disdain of altruism and empathy. Her books rationalize and justify selfishness, opportunism and exploitation, and still inspire those who exalt such traits.) But this movie is in fact a scathing indictment of selfishness.   Self-sacrifice and selflessness have been the most powerful themes in all of literature and art, including the ultimate storyof self-sacrifice, that of Christ (though you'd hardly guess it judging by today's Christians).  Selfishness, on the other hand, is the primary characteristic of evil.   The quote by John Paul Sartre near the end of the movie sums it up beautifully.

1439196834|5.0|I bought this book because I love Barney Stinson from How I Met Your Mother and I couldn't believe that they published the book he so often referred to in the show. Everything that hes ever mentioned is actually in there and its HILARIOUS. I love it.
B000XO2R22|5.0|My step-dad has been one of my biggest musical influences as long as I have known him. He not only helped me flesh out my interest in things like jazz, classic rock, and some of the 80's indie stuff I missed out on, but he and I bounce new stuff off each other all the time. There are lots and lots of misses, but at rate of about 1 in 10 we blow each other away. Sea Change was one of those.    He gave this to me as a Christmas gift soon after it was released. I hadn't heard about this one yet, and my step-dad told me it wasn't like most of Beck's work, but I couldn't understand just how different until I listened to it. I think he compared it to the whole Dylan going electric or Dylan going country type changes. The record opens with an acoustic chord progression and basically never leaves that vibe.    The record is solid and cohesive the entire way through. It is very emotional and takes the highs and lows that I think mark a great record. I tend to listen to records, not songs or artists. And to me the best are ones that almost take the shape of a good story. Establish a feel, drag you up and down a bit to the climax, then close. It can be done a ton of ways, and Beck does it here.    Beck is in my opinion one of the most genius musicians in the history of recorded music. With Sea Change we get to see the application of that genius in a totally different way.

B0000009XP|5.0|Buddy Guy's best album imo ...The title song ,I Smell A Rat ,<br />the Hendrix flavored You've Been Gone Too Long , the blues/rock ditty She's Out There Somewhere , Buddy's take on the old Louis Jordon classic Outskirts of Town , the bluesy Are You Losing Your Mind and When I Left Home...all killer . Six songs in total of some of the best blues tracks ever laid down . If you like raw gritty blues this is one of the best of it's genre .
0345494997|2.0|Despite fear of irking the wrath of several readers, I will be bold and state that for me, this book was akin to watching paint dry.<br />It is a different matter altogether that I did not like the main characters, but perhaps this would not have been an issue if I could have liked the (slow) style of the book.<br />FLW was known for his egocentricity and clearly was an altogether not nice guy, but he still was smart enough to be able to go back and forth between his families, to some extent. Whatever inspired Mamah to desert her secure home and family life to move in with him? Was she enthralled by his brilliance? I could not see anything else.<br />The book was a tedious read for me, though I did plod through to the end. The only positive thing I can say, is that it opened my curiosity to find out more about this master architect's work, and fawn at his magnificent works. Yes! Once again, a triumph for FLW and not the woman who left her life for him.
0143116738|4.0|It is a great book. It makes me thing that there is not another option than being passionate with work and life, wich at the end should be same.

B00479SVBU|5.0|I've owned several FM transmitters that include popular name brands, and the Satechi SoundFly Aux is the best.  Ever been frustrated with static on an available FM station? I have too, but not with this little wonder.  The audio is crisp and clear even in a metro area.  The SD card slot plays my MP3 audio books and music perfectly.  The remote control allows for hands free operation.  The auxiliary input allows any audio device with a standard earphone jack to play music as well.  I love it!  I would buy again.  I don't usually write reviews, but this one deserves 5 stars.
B00405DUYO|4.0|What appeal to me the most to watch this movie is Ewan McGregor/Phillip Morris...He is so adorable and I thought he did really good job in this movie. I'm not a fan of J.Carey but I think he suitable potraying the con man. There a few thing impress me in this movie: Good story line (Oh, they are so lucky everything going well for them despite the fact that they living their live in prison); good script and cinematography and; Ewan & Jim did a very good job in this movie.

B001FB4VXU|4.0|Great product, I love the show.  When reviewing a television season on DVD, it doesn't always make sense to say \\"I hate this show, so I'm giving it 1 star\\" or \\"I love this show, 5 stars all the way!\\"  You should already know if you love or hate a show before buying the complete second season on DVD.    Therefore, I'm giving it 4 stars because the last episode of the season wouldn't play for me.  I didn't see any noticeable scratches, but it would just \\"hiccup\\" partway through the episode and through various attempts, various DVD players, various cleanings, it never made it more than a few minutes in.    For a NEW DVD package, it sucks to have something like that happen, especially for the season finale.
B000H6SXMY|5.0|As soon as I received this I had a marathon of Friends! This set is amazing and comes with a handy episode guide. So worth the money spent to have this in my collection!
B0041YI4ZO|3.0|A slight disappointment. Wasn't as good as IP 1 or IP2. The DVD was watchable, but not very good quality.
0312600844|1.0|The characters in this book are boring and annoying.  The story is not compelling or even interesting.  I'm at a complete loss to explain such positive reviews.  I enjoyed The Corrections, and would say I read a fair amount of what is termed contemporary fiction, this did nothing for me. If you must read this because like me, you read lots of great reviews, wait until it's in paperback, or go to the library.

0385504225|2.0|This was my first Dan Brown book and it will be my last.  I should have known this was not going to be good, but the book club said I had to read it and I'm a team player, so...  This book dragged on and on and on.  The story started out pretty good and I even took a minute to look up noetic science.  I soon lost interest, though, with all of the technology and explaining of this term and that one, and the freemasonry theme.  It was a real struggle to finish.  I thought the actions of the characters in the last few chapters was rather unbelievable and the pay-off was lacking. No more of this author for me.
B0042JTDXK|2.0|I've always loved Josh's singing and still do.  However, the songs on this cd just don't belong together. It's all over the place.  I had a tough time listening to the 1st two-thirds.  That's never happened to me with one of his cd's.  The mix of pop/show tune opera didn't flow well.  I'm not saying all of the songs are bad, they just don't belong together.  The best part is the last 2 to 3 songs which blend absolutely beautiful but are way out there.   I know Josh wants to show his hip young side,too.  That's o.k. if he experimented with that on a separate c.d.  But, he also needs to be realistic about where his talent really belongs.    Rick Rubin didn't do anything for Josh.  He's not educated enough for Josh's genre. I think that's why he let Josh have so much control.  Josh is still in the learning stages of producing and needed the guidance of someone like David Foster.  Yes, Foster is overkill and Josh wants more independence. But, I think he could have demanded that of Foster like Michael Buble did.  Some of these songs are too philosophical, sometimes a bit corney, and the lyrics are sometimes hard to follow even after reading the words.      I wanted so much to see Josh in concert this time around. But, I couldn't bear to sit thru a concert of this c.d.  It just isn't a Grammy winner.  Like the cliche says, \\"if it's not broke don't fix it.\\"  Can't tell if he wants to go broadway or pop.   Just sad after the long wait.
B003R0MF1W|5.0|We had the cable for the TV disconnected about five years ago.  A friend told us about The Mentalist DVD's and we are very pleased with the shows.  Our family enjoys watching them more than once, and when purchasing the whole season, (or a couple/few seasons!) it's nice to watch over and over.  We definitely \\"got our money's worth\\"...<br />Quality is very good- stories are fun, detective mystery, etc. Love the cast of this show...and we can't wait for the next season!
0399156577|4.0|I think I might have read a Nora Roberts along time ago but someone recommended this and it's fabulous!  I've been reading mostly light easy fun fiction but thought I'd stir things up and add some mystery in, and I'm glad I've been doing that!      Fiona Bristow leads a canine search and rescue group and is a very likeable character.  Simon Doyle brings his dog to Fiona, in the hopes she can train him and despite their intentions not to get involved....  Throw a serial killer into the story and you've got an entertaining novel!  I would have given it 5, but it was a long read (for me). Lately I've been gravitating towards more fast paced reads (shorter novels).

030745455X|5.0|The Girl who played with Fire suffered from the same blunt prose that plagued the series starter, The Girl with the Dragon Tattoo. It still dragged along at inconvenient moments when one wished the plot picked up speed, but went on instead with mind-numbing expositions about what, series heroine, Lisbeth Salander, did during her modest holiday of sorts around the world. As we recalled from the previous book, Lisbeth did get some coin onto her breadbasket after a shrewd siphoning of Hans-Erik Wennerstrom's corrupt funds, but it seemed it was just the beginning.<br /><br />Nothing that Stieg has produced from his pen can be termed as simple.<br /><br />Just the pure fact these books were posthumous publications, were translations from the Swedish language, adds to the intrigue of the plot surrounding wholly disparate characters that seemed to be caricatures of real figures from Stieg's own life as an active journalist. He knew these people and wrote them into existence. If there were any questions to the characters ` reality, the quality of the character development, even with the peripheral ones, pushed them away with a silk-gloved hand. And Lisbeth stands as the exception, the only one that could be convincingly categorized as a character with almost no real-life counterparts. But even she has appealing elements in her that suggested Stieg's over-discussed intolerance to subservient violence.<br /><br />Which is to point out overtly to how Stieg recognized the human condition on such a deep level, that he produced such a plot device as an ambiguity factor to get Lisbeth into a bad light based on her contentious trimmings and her dysfunctions. A naïve perspective underlies much of the narrative, bordering on obsessive. Engineered to put as much emphasis on detail as possible seemed to be Stieg's approach, a perhaps antiquated discipline of writing that harkens back to Tolstoy or Dickens, when existential and trivial minutiae were in free flow. Achieving that with the direct language Stieg employed, even remarkable, and everything seemed to have a specific thematic or plot-related purpose that the winding prose doesn't indicate at first glance.<br /><br />As a continuation of the story or not, the overall arc has a grand scale (viewed as a standalone and as an entry of a series, both), winding down a literary road trodden a dozen times over but still leading somewhere never before seen, a terrifying peep into how Stieg's world view, his cynical and hardened perspective of how Crime functions in all its forms and layers. Lisbeth and the other characters were just forces driving that vision.<br /><br />Moreover, he pushed up his game by improving on the technical aspects of the writing and the prose, as if he saw fit to improve upon what already worked for him. He never lost it, going into this second book, even with the series' intrinsic flaws taken into full consideration. It was as if he couldn't help it.eg employed, even remarkable, and everything seemed to have a specific thematic or plot-related purpose that the winding prose doesn't indicate at first glance.

Of course in the very first episode of this series you find out who actually dies where the season before leaves off.  Is it going to be George or Izzy who doesn't make it?  Brings tears to your eyes, but really what episode on Grey's doesn't?  It is worth the purchase in more ways than one!  Jenn
B004259BMM|5.0|This CD is great!!!  11 songs + live tracks from concerts.  Keith's guitar solos are fantastic.  Without You is my favorite.  Well, You Gonna Fly is pretty amazing too.  I think I like this CD more than the last one.  Go out and buy it now.  You won't regret it.    Wow, just an update.  I absolutely love this CD even more than the first time I reviewed it.  Without You is an amazing song and on its way to the top.  If you haven't gotten this cd yet get it now - even just for this song - it is so worth it!!!!

B000AMJG4Y|5.0|This movie is great for fans of final fantasy. The animations are wonderful. I find myself watching this movie over and over, even in the Japanese dubbed. I personally love the characters, especially Cloud. The fight scenes are really epic and over dramatic like many Japanese movies/shows, but that is why I love them.
B002ZG99CC|5.0|If you are looking for this movie to be \\"just like\\" the old Karate Kid it was not. I am so glad! It was taken from the concept but it wasn't just like the old one. I don't want to say too much to give away the movie but I did enjoy watching this as a family movie. Jackie Chan, Jaden Smith and Taraji p. Henson were so great but the other characters were good too. Our family decided to wait until this came out on DVD and it was well worth the wait! Great Movie!
B002ZTIIXK|3.0|After having heard KD's live 2005 Winnipeg performance of Hallelujah on YouTube, I ordered this set just for that particular song, plus one other of her CD's.  While this set says it has the \\"New\\" Hallelujah, I should have researched it further because it is NOT the live performance which is a total knockout.  Other tunes are okay (and I am a KD fan), but nothing worth raving about.  I purchased a brand new set from Amazon and on the first play in my car had some problems with skipping...hope it's the car cd player and not the actual disc.  Guess it's time to break down and buy an iPod.  :-(
B00003CXRP|2.0|This movie is about a south pacific islander hermit that goes to the USA to track down two women for various reasons. I disliked that the gentlemen had so much monologue with himself and a soccer ball on the island.

0143035711|4.0|Robert Mason flew choppers in Vietnam from 1965 - 1966. His book is a testament to the bravery of the chopper pilots who served.<br /><br />The Prologue has Mason listing things he didn't know about Vietnam prior to his deployment to Vietnam, Things like the USA once supported Ho Chi Minh against the Japs in WWII. He didn't know that Britain handed Vietnam back to the French after WWII. He didn't know that Vietnam threw the French out after a 9 year war culminating in Dien Bien Phu in 1954. There's more he didn't know but one thing he knew for sure, he wanted to fly. Fly helicopters more than anything.<br /><br />The chapters starts with Mason recalling how, as a child, he dreamed of levitating. He takes us through basic, advanced infantry and then flight school training prior to being shipped off to Vietnam.<br /><br />Landing in Vietnam he recalls how he felt about leaving his wife and young child back home and facing the prospect of a year away from them. Mason is all keyed up as he starts his one year tour. Flying with the Air-cav he goes into one hot LZ after another. One of these LZ's is X-ray the subject of the book and subsequent movie \\"We were Soldiers\\".<br /><br />The guts these fliers had to have to survive is staggering. Once you hit the ground you are basically sitting there until the unit you are resupplying, dropping off, picking up etc tells you to leave. He recalls seeing muzzle flashes from all sides including the front. He tells us how the old salts taught him to fly in formation by picking out reference points on the chopper in front of you.<br /><br />During the book Mason starts to tell us how he felt he was losing his mind and how he'd wake up from the same nightmare sweating profusely time and time again. Despite his love for his wife and child, he still succumbed to the trappings of a war zone and engaged in sex with prostitutes. For me, this didn't take anything away from his character as, in a place where any day could be your last, what else do you have? At least he admits it to the world.<br /><br />As the book moves along, the irony inherent to so many soldiers starts to kick in. The reasoning behind the war comes into question. Are we the good guys as we level villages and kill and relocate the South Vietnamese. Why won't the ARVN fight? Why aren't we holding captured real estate? all the questions have no answers but the job still has to be done.<br /><br />The Epilogue is a condensed narrative of Mason's life after Vietnam up until 1981 or so. It reads like a trail of bad luck and devastation as he deals with PTSD and nervous paranoia. So sad given his service to his country.<br /><br />I thoroughly enjoyed the book. One of the better ones I've read in the Vietnam none-fiction category as it's well written, doesn't focus TOO hard on individual battles but more provokes thought from the reader as to the whole episode of Vietnam and it's worthiness.to the world.

B004259BMM|5.0|Love this CD - Keith Urban does it again!  Catchy lyrics and music, with more depth to his voice than previous albums.  I really enjoy his work, and loved hearing all of the new songs.  \\"Georgia Woods\\" and \\"Long Hot Summer\\" will be my favorites I'm guessing.  For all of the reviewers complaining about 8 songs - the price is lower than other newly released CDs, and reasonable. I agree that the Target version is worth purchasing.  I pre-ordered with Amazon, but bought the Target CD earlier today.  My Amazon copy will be a gift for a lucky friend!<br /><br />Great job Keith!!!!
031603438X|5.0|Read this book if:<br />  You are a musician.  First and foremost Keith Richards is a musician.  There is nothing else in his life that matters as much.  Except -- because he barely mentions them -- his wife and last two daughters.  He spends a lot of ink on the ways to approach music, moving to a five string guitar configuration, finding the combination of chords that meets the music he hears in his head.  Any musician would love his discussions of how he reached out to the music and it became his salvation and the single thing that distinguishes him from everyone else.  The technical discussions and his (unique) creative process are the signposts to the essential Richards.<br /><br />  IF you love the Stones.  Any detail adds to the lore.  Many of the stories are here (and some of the myth busters).<br /><br />  If you think all doped out pop gods are stupid:  Richards is a lot of things, but stupid he is not.<br /><br />  If you don't trust The Man.  Richards doubts the sincerity and motives of society's gatekeepers (cops, The System) and gives lots of cogent reasons why he is right.  I suspect he would prefer a gentle anarchy.<br /><br />Don't read this book if:<br /><br />  You think that stories, anecdotes and legal trials (literally and figuratively) are stories with a beginning, middle, end and concluding summation. His stories are often just impressions (which are what most of carry with us, before we add the patina of review and drawing personal conclusions).<br /><br />  If characterization matters.  Keith strikes the reader as a man of feelings, not analytics.  There are some portraits that end up reasonably well fleshed out (Chuck Berry--a musical genius but perhaps less than the best of men) but most discussions glance over the characters or dimensions of individuals.  (Bobby Keys is his best friend, but I never quite figured out why.)  Richards seems to assess others entirely on their relationship with himself, and with no other requirement than loyalty and a willingness to watch his back or, in a separate category, if they are his musical gods. You are not going to learn a lot about the famous and not very famous names that dot the text other than whether they are good to Keith.<br /><br />  Don't go here if you think you are going to learn something new in celebrity news or insights into the Rich and Famous.<br /><br />  Don't pick it up if you don't approve of drugs.

I came away with the impression that Richards is a Musician (capital \\"M\\")-- and entirely self absorbed.

0802798225|5.0|I finished this book really quickly. I enjoyed the mis-matched romance aspect and the look behind the facade of some character stereotypes. I plan on reading the sequel and other books by the author.
0812550706|3.0|[[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]    \\"Nature can't evolve a species that hasn't a will to survive.\\" (P. 278)    \\"Ender's Game\\" was published while I was in college.  I had never heard of it before last year, but, more recently, I have seen it mentioned several times in blogs and such.  It's said to be very popular among our troops serving in Afghanistan and Iraq, so it piqued my curiosity.      Even though I'm not a big Sci Fi fan, I bought the book and began reading.  As I read the book, I kept thinking how similar it was to Heinlein's \\"Starship Trooper\\", which is one of the few Sci Fi books I did read and enjoy as a teenager.  It is also similar to \\"The Giver\\" by Lois Lowry in that it is about a boy with a special talent who receives a special education to meet society's needs, but Ender doesn't run away from his responsibility.  He's not really given the chance.  I finished \\"Ender's Game\\" yesterday.      I feel the book starts off slowly, but not so slowly that I wanted to put the book aside.  Plus, the first part of the book is justified by the book's conclusion.  Having said that, I was more than half way through the book (pp. 231-32 of 357) before I found something really remarkable.  My diligence found its reward in the final chapter, \\"Speaker for the Dead\\", which made the book a truly worthwhile read (I won't reveal why).  After finishing the book, I then read some of the reviews posted by other readers here at Amazon.com.  One reviewer suggested it would have been better if Card had made Ender, et al, teenagers, and I agree.  I too was uncomfortable with the main characters being children.       I never identified with Ender personally, perhaps because I have never felt alienated or socially marginalized by my peers.  I also did not recognize the military indoctrination process Card describes.  My experience with military training is extensive, and to me military training was always about \\"team building\\" and not about ostracizing the individual in order to create a sense of paranoia that might reveal character flaws.     My conclusion is that this book's target audience is teenage boys, and those years are far behind me.  That is probably why I did not find this book quite as satisfying as others who rated this book higher.   It is also my opinion that many of the reviewers who rated this book very negatively did not understand the final chapter.  [[ASIN:0812550706 Ender's Game (Ender, Book 1)]]

B002UJIY7A|5.0|For once this is a thriller that acutally thrills and keeps you guessing with several twists.  Almost as good as Agatha Christie.
B003IPC5SO|4.0|\\"Aphrodite\\" is the album you may have well been waiting for if you miss great pop albums that work as a whole these days, with the notable exception of Lady GaGa, whose \\"Fame (Monster)\\" come close. Yes, Kylie Minogue, in her early 40's now and past breast cancer (among other setbacks threatening to end her career), is as alive and kicking as ever. The 2010 summer album is at least up to par with anything she has put out so far. Track for track, it is arguably even better than the acclaimed \\"Fever\\" and \\"Body Language\\". No duds here. The smooth opener \\"All The Lovers\\" gets out of the way for the belter \\"Get Outta My Way\\" - a joyful celebration of anything that pop music and disco means. Great hooks continue to abound, from \\"Put Your Hands Up\\" to the closer \\"Can't Beat the Feeling\\". Highlights include the hypnotic but quite short \\"Closer\\" and \\"Better Than Today\\", co-penned by Jake Shears of Scissor Sisters. OK, don't expect any deep messages. If you want any, go to U2 or Joni Mitchell. This slant here is pure pop, guilty pleasure maybe, but reminding of good old times and at the same time very new. Songs and rhythm.

I got hooked on the first book I read (Excavation) and now I've completed four and got my son and friends hooked as well passing on the books I read.  They are a definite roller coaster of action and books you just don't want to put down filled with intrigue, action, and surprises.  I'd love to see any of them put into movies!!

B00447G2MK|1.0|this is the worst adtr cd yet, almost everything about them that was good is gone, the screams are almost non existent except for a few songs, and it seems like its not as catchy as before..i don't get why they don't just get rid of the screaming already since it seems every cd there fine with cutting a huge chunk of it out and using it less and less, don't waste your money on this cd, heck its not even worth downloading for free off the internet
B00428ZRFY|2.0|DO NOT BUY THE DELUXE EDITION IF YOU WANT ALL THE LYRICS. Not worth the dvd to get a cd made for children. Why would you ever bleep a CD that is sung by the same person that made Rated R!!! That CD had so much swearing in it. COME ON PEOPLE.
1608870081|4.0|Harry Potter: A Pop-Up Book is a good book. But only for true Potter fans. And probably small children.    There are only a few pop ups in the book, which include Diagon Alley, Hogwarts, the Forbidden Forest/Hagrid's Hut (basically Hogwarts Grounds), the graveyard and the Dragon task for the Triwizard tournament. It is very well made, and I feel that a lot of effort has gone into making this.    The actual information in this book is satisfactory, but makes you want to know more. You can't expect too much from a pop up book like this. It isn't made for any casual reader. Only some Harry Potter fans would actually be able to appreciate it, and small children would enjoy the pop ups. Each page has a few smaller thing that pops up too.     The first part includes a letter from Dumbledore's office, a poster of the book's cover art and an Undesirable No. 1 Poster. You are greeted with a pop up howler (which you have to actually open yourself) which also talks about how the howlers are put into the movies.    Overall, this gets only 4 stars because of the very specific audience that would probably enjoy this. (Also, I preordered this and Amazon shipped it to me so that I received it a day in advance, so kudos to Amazon too).
B0029XFN9O|5.0|This DVD is terrific! Quality of the picture is great, delivery was very fast. All in all I am very pleased with this purchase!
B003YWUTJI|3.0|I have always been a big fan of Norah Jones and her hauntingly beautiful voice.  While you can tell how her voice matures over the almost ten years that went into recording this album, I have to admit, it was not what I expected.  There are songs on there that made me smile, like her duet with Willie Nelson on Baby It's Cold Outside.  But for the most part, I was disappointed that the Norah I've come to love was lost in the harmonies of many of the songs.
B001EJYOBM|5.0|This series needs to continue in one form or another.  Side stories were great, but before I knew it I had watched it all and the fun was over.  More please!
0385504225|5.0|I read all off Dan Brown's other books.  This is as good as the others, but reads more like The Da Vinci Code than Deception point. I would highly recommend this book if you are a Dan Brown Fan.
B003ZHQVJO|2.0|I anxiously awaited the release of the Kid's new album and I didn't expect him to top Rock 'n Roll Jesus but this album doesn't have even one memorable song.  It's all the same country sound throughout.  It's a sleeper.  The last track has great lyrics but Kid is singing in such an odd high tone it's just weird.  Still a Kid Rock fan but I'm truly disappointed.
B003UYV08E|5.0|Iron Man 2 is hilarious!!!   The witty humor and superb action sequences make this a better movie than the first one, IMO.   Comics fans may prefer a more serious superhero treatment but I really enjoyed what the filmmakers have devised here.   The action sequence with Scarlett Johansson as the Black Widow made my jaw drop.
B004259BMM|5.0|Oh my goodness, I picked up the new Deluxe Ablum today at Target, and awaiting the orignal from Amazon.... this ALBUM IS SO SO FANTASTIC... great guitar, vocals and massive variety of instruments on different songs... and lyric's to hit you straight in the heart!!!  very touching love songs, and happy carefree songs, about love, life and all that it entails!!  Great job on this album Keith, I sincerely LOVE it!!!  beautiful!!!   A must have if you love good honest music!!!
B00028HBKM|5.0|The price was right, the movie definitely right! The movie was in good condition and it came in a fast manner!
B003O86FMW|1.0|Ok so I loved the first book it was really really good, but in the second it became a soap oprah of retarded lovetriangles and teen angst bs. In the second book this amazing series turned into another boring teen-love drama. If you liked the first book DO NOT READ THIS BOOK, remember it as a good book and deny the existence of this one.
0307454541|1.0|I don't understand the rave reviews or hype over this book.  The writing is adequate, the characters mildly interesting, but overall the plot was dull and bloated.  This book will not be handed down to posterity as good literature.  Like so many other Dan Brown-ish pulps, even those people who gave it 5 stars might look back in a few years and scratch their heads.<br /><br />How many psychopaths does it take to make this plot plod along? 3<br />Unnecessary sexualization of rape?  Yes<br />How many gratuitous sexual partners does each main character need to have? 2+<br />Is Blomqvist a manwhore?  Yes.<br />Is Salander an inaccurate representation of someone with Aspergers?  Yes.<br /><br />I feel that Steig merely used Asperger's Syndrome to cover up his inability to write a realistic female character.  While I appreciate AS being brought into  public awareness, Salander's contrived abilities do not accurately reflect the reality of AS.<br /><br />The only lingering question for me is how many STI/STD positive results come back on Blomqvist's next medical exam.  I won't be reading Book 2 or 3 to find out.
0307592839|5.0|I'm a formerly voracious reader that goes through phases of disenchantment with the state of the novel today. But this book just takes off in a direction that just makes me believe again in limitless human creativity. As a book it defies genre, weaving together a series of short stories. At the beginning, it seems a little shallow, as characters are seemingly left behind just as they appear to be coming into their own. But Ms. Egan keeps picking the key ones up, and by the end of the book you have characters that have grown and endeared themselves as much as in any novel you love. This one will stay with me a long time...unfortunately it sets a high bar for the next one on my list.

1442300051|5.0|Michael Lewis does a great job of humanizing a handful of the players involved in the sub prime \\"industry,\\" and in doing so gives a real feel for how things developed, how incentives were horribly misaligned and much of what went wrong at a very micro level.  Regulators are basically not mentioned at all, which is a bit of a shortcoming of the book, but, in the end its a great story and its hard to criticize it for not including things that weren't a part of that story.
0316236535|5.0|A very fun, powerful book for little ones.  It gives them the opportunity to tell the monster to go away bit by bit. Example:Go away white sharp teeth, and then the teeth dissapear until the monster is all gone. This was a favorite in my preschool class, and now is a favorite with my grandson. It's also fun to create your own monster out of construction paper, and discuss how monsters are just pretend, etc...
B003YWUTJI|4.0|I heard this CD for the first time today and I loved it. I listened to it while working in the office. It's been a crazy day and this was a great way to hide the hustle and bustle. Nice, calming music. Would be perfect dinner music or just relaxing with a nice glass of wine in hand.
0340896965|1.0|The summary really attracted me, I had read so many good reviews, I wanted to love it....but I hated it. It felt so slow paced, was never funny, not even in a dark witty way, I had to skip lines to be able to get going (I have never done this not even with the worst books I've read) and it never brought me to the emotions that the author was trying to.     The one good thing, the only I liked was the reality of it, but I feel it was badly written. It never made me feel any emotion, I never felt any sympathy for the character nor did I find them likeable. I don't think one has to love a character in a book but somehow one must feel some sort of connection to them. I never even felt sad at the tragic twist in the end. It had the potential to be climatic just as the part when they finally get together, in turn I felt saying to myself \\"what? does it?\\" these two parts where so important in the whole scheme of things, instead the author chose not to delevelop these scenes at all taking more time to describe boring, non-relevant parts in great detail. I felt completely disatisfied because the story line had so much potential, and it never reaches it.
B003ZHQVJO|3.0|It doesn't appear that this record is going to get much RAVES.  It shouldn't either, it's actually just ok.  I think KR is going to fully cross over to country.  His last 2 efforts lead one to beleive this is the case.  Iwill put him in the category of a Zac Brown Band.  Great sound/band with the ability to play a country and rock hybrid of music.  I'm not saying this is bad, but for KR fans, if you haven't figured this out by now, don't buy this record.  Het don't fret musicians sometime wonder from their original roots, and end up going back (usually to late from a career standpoint).  It's safe to say KR is no longer Rock.  Let's hope he wins a CMA (wouldn't that be funny). Oh well, thankfully he had some early good Rock, thanks for the memories!
0307266303|5.0|I found this book slow to start, but once it gripped you I couldn't put it down. Great insight into the Ultra-Marathon world. Recommended.
B0045DO8NI|3.0|Ok, so I bought the Deluxe version (w/DVD) and as sit here (and type) all the video's are 'sware' edited...Um (WTF is up w/that P!nk, Ms. Exec. Producer)  Very Disappointing!  What's the purpose of having an \\"Explicit\\" label on this if it's NOT Explicit?  Seems alittle misleading.  Either P!nk wasn't the exectuive producer here, or she's fallin' to her label, either way it's weak to release these video's edited like this.  As for the content, sure it's a good collector/fan item.  P!nk is very much a creative musician and she stands up for what she believes, but she was sitting on the editing of the video segment.  This was a perfect time for her to shine, I'll say she's only glowing.  But, who am I to say, I'm just a fan critising a label.  Live up to what you believe and stand bye it. If you have no need for video's and don't own all her records, then this is a perfect Hits record (the none deluxe record that is.)  Thanks for reading.
B000003TAB|4.0|This is a good album. But it is not as polished as the bigger albums such as Nevermind or In Utero. It is not nearly as pop like as the others but It has some things to offer. If you are an off and on fan then you may not care for it much. It is much closer to the the sound that was coming out in the beginning days of \\"grunge\\"
B00428CPUY|5.0|Clapton's 2010 version of CGF is excellent just based on the number and wide variety of artists that perform. For less than $20, where else are you going to get Robert Cray w/ Hubert Sumlin, Buddy Guy w/ Ron Wood & Johnny Lang, Derek Trucks & Warren Haymes, Albert Lee & Vince Gil w/ James Burton, Clapton & Winwood, Clapton & Beck, ZZ Top, etc. etc. etc.     If you e njoy screaming guitars, well worth the price of admission.
B004BC7MRM|1.0|Let me preface this by saying that I am a huge fan, as many before me have also noted.  What happened to the American Badass Kid ROCK?  I couldn't make it through the samples on Amazon for this one...zzzzz.  I bought Rock n Roll Jesus after I heard So Hott, thinking the whole record might rock like that, which of course it did not.  It was like the prequel to Born Free.  The vocal on the title track Born Free is painful to listen to, let alone watch in the video. This should be called something like The Bob Ritchie Band.  Bob Rock has apparently lost his magic touch as well.  Dance with the girl ya brought man...we like our Devil/History/Cocky/ROCK/and thank GOD for LIVE TRUCKER.  I like my Kid Mf-in Rock from the old school.

B0042JTDXK|5.0|\\"Illuminations\\" is undoubtedly Groban's strongest effort to date. I have been a long time Groban fan and this album is very different than his previous work. It has a different feel, a different emotion and sound. A good change from the predictable and safe Foster produced albums. Producer Rick Rubin has definitely achieved a whole new exciting sound and direction for Groban. The collaboration works and I don't sense an ounce of gimmick. It is a more raw and pure sound. Groban's voice and talent truly shines in this album.  I highly recommended. Every song is great and you will not be disappointed. Go get it now!
0811875555|5.0|As artbooks go, this offering was a great compilation of production stills, storyboard work, layouts and most importantly Glen Keane sketches. The book is separated into the history, the characters, the layout designs and story.    I love how most of the book gives each section a lot of emphasis on the pre-production work, the renderings, the character drawings and models. There wasn't as much 3D stills even though this movie is technically the first Disney fairy tale in that format. However, what makes this book such a nice addition to my artbook set is that it focused more on the pre-production hand drawn/painted artwork that is the hallmark of many Disney animated movies.
B0040JHWKS|5.0|Buy it now. Seriously. Honestly having a hard time understanding why this has not been released before. Forget all these morons talking about how some songs had to be finished before they were released. I HATE Springsteen's new stuff, and honestly went into this with low expectations. I gotta say, I was totally wrong. Most of these songs could easily have been on Darkness.
B003EYVY04|4.0|This isn't my favorite of the HP movies, but I do think the documentary included in this special edition about how the creatures of the series have been made is fascinating. Disappointed that there is no extended version, though.
B003IY48PS|1.0|Yes,they advertised the 2 disc version but on 2 seperate occasions sent the one disc version.  So that's my review.
B0040JHXTS|5.0|Where do I begin? Darkness was released just after my 18th birthday as I was finishing up high school, and then a week before heading out for college I saw my first Bruce show in Charlotte, NC. The album has always represented to me the best part of what Bruce's music is about - there is pain and suffering and disappointment, but mainly there is hope and redemption. Whereas Born to Run was about finding freedom from the shackles of life, Darkness was about the realization that no matter how far you go there will always be something in your way and learning to live with that. The hope of BTR is in the running away; in Darkness the hope is in truly living even in the midst of the despair.     This box set is one of those rare things that you drop $100 on and don't mind, because what it returns to you is priceless. I popped The Promise CD in my car's deck the minute I walked out the store and was immediately sucked in the Racing in the Street (78). The harmonica, the tempo, it was perfect. There are so many gems here, but I don't want to comment as I have not had the time to really sort through them. I was intrigued by Candy's Boy though - a stark contrast to the finished product.    When I got home, I watched the '78 Houston show first. There is always that measure of disappointment when you pop a blu-ray in and you come to realize that 32 year old footage is going to have that VCR quality to it. This was no exception. Framed in 4:3 and containing more than a fair amount of interference, it does not do much as far as eye candy is concerned. However, once you settle in and see a 28 year old Bruce commanding the stage, it does not matter. The set-list is spot on and contains the usual suspects along with some rare goodies. But what is does best is capture the essence of a Darkness show, and despite not singing \\"Growin' Up\\" (my favorite moment at the '78 show I attended) it brought me back to a very familiar place. As usual, the camera follows Bruce 95% of the time, so the camera time for Steve, Roy, Gary, Max and Danny is limited. In addition there are times where the stages lights are so dim it virtually impossible to see anything. I found that a little frustrating. Overall? I am extremely pleased with this and am grateful for its inclusion.    The 2009 footage is beautiful. After seeing the band in '78 the switch to 2009 was a little dose of reality. Man these guys have aged! (Gracefully I might add). The overall tone is somewhat somber, but I have not completely watched it all. I did miss seeing Danny at the keyboards though, but such is life.    The 1976-1978 footage is fantastic. Again, I have not seen it all, but what I did watch was mesmerizing. Those guys were so YOUNG and so hopeful and so talented. I can't wait to dig deeper into this.    I have not seen the documentary so I cannot comment on it yet.    Lastly, I listed to the remastered Darkness CD on my way to work today. All I can say is BRILLIANT. The sound is full and rich and deep and sounds so much better than my old CD. From the opening anthem of \\"Badlands\\" to the closing notes of \\"Darkness\\" I was 15 minutes late for work, but in a much better mood when I arrived. The album is one of the best and now it sounds like it should. Oh how I hope they do the same for The River.    So - sell a kidney, eat bologna, forego the movies for a few months, but by all means don't miss this opportunity. Blu-ray vs. DVD? I only paid $10 more for the blu-ray, but if it is $20 or more, my guess is that the DVD would suffice.    Oh yeah - I almost forgot the notebook. I guess it is best described as the pièce de résistance.
0316069485|4.0|Much to his credit, Michael Connelly has never been content to rest on his laurels and just pump out more Harry Bosch novels. In \\"The Reversal\\" he has attempted something very ambitious: a pure courtroom drama in which his plucky and experienced defence lawyer Mickey Haller is persuaded to become a prosecutor for just one case. Moreover, Haller finds himself working with Harry Bosch as his assigned investigator. Such is his stature that each new Connelly is eagerly anticipated, and some reviewers have even been suggesting that John Grisham's position as the leading American \\"legal thriller\\" writer is in danger. Well, yes and no. This is an excellent and absorbing book, with no obvious flaws. The question that I ask myself, though, is whether Connelly bit off a little more than he could chew. While juggling the complex legal manoeuvres and politics of the case, keeping Bosch and Haller (and Haller's ex-wife Maggie McPherson, who joins the prosecution team) in hand, and maintaining the tension with all sorts of potential angles and scares - could he just have dropped the ball when it comes to the actual plot, which of course is the most important thing of all? The book runs to just under 400 pages (of fairly large type), and I think that to do real justice to the possibilities Connelly conjures up would have taken more like 700-800 pages.<br /><br />Connelly was a crime reporter before he began writing novels, and it has always showed. When it comes to police procedure, how policemen and lawyers think, and especially the specifics of crime and justice in Los Angeles, Connelly rules supreme. His main oeuvre has been the long series of excellent detective books starring Harry Bosch (together with a large and colourful cast of other characters). But he has also written several books about defence attorney Mickey Haller, and a few others starting with \\"The Poet\\". One thing that has always struck me about Connelly is that he is a no-nonsense writer in the tradition of Raymond Chandler, Mickey Spillane and other hard-boiled thriller authors: he is strongest when following a dramatic chain of events, but not so good at (or, perhaps, interested in) characterisation. His people act and talk, but one rarely gets a very strong feeling of who they are, so to speak; in my experience, Bosch is the only one of his characters with whom I ever feel any empathy at all. Perhaps for similar reasons, I have never found Connelly's villains particularly terrifying. He has depicted murderers aplenty, and some - such as the Poet - are certainly cruel, ingenious, and merciless. Yet they never seem quite as scary as Hannibal Lecter - or Thomas Harris' even more frightening (because more human) creation Francis Dolarhyde.dler, Mickey Spillane and other hard-boiled thriller authors: he is strongest when following a dramatic chain of events, but not so good at (or, perhaps, interested in) characterisation.

B0021L8V1Q|3.0|I just actually watched the first Iron Man for the first time this year, mainly because i thought the second one actually looked pretty good. I just really didn't even pay attention when the first was released because comic book films just really aren't my thing. The first was good, not stellar, but great effects a decent story, the very cocky Tony Stark whom you can't help but like, and good action. The second film starts out rather slowly, with a few action sequences here and there, and Mickey Rourke playing the bad man as usual. Rourke is fantastic in most films i've seen him in, this one is an exception as he has little to no dialogue because he is Russian. I wanted to see him a bit more verbal, and also doing more than just working on robots.    Don Cheadle is a nice addition this time around, and definitely a better actor than the previous guy. Where the films falls flat is its pace, its very back and forth with moments of boredom and other moments where you sit up and take notice. The funny moments really aren't funny, and the sarcasm really isn't nearly as good as in the first film. Stark's cockiness really gets pretty annoying in the beginning of the film, but then takes a back seat for an apparent reason about half way through the film. As far as a story, well there's were it hits rock bottom, there is none. There is only one new revelation to be revealed in the film to make you go ohhh ok cool, thats about it. Other than that its just the basic good guy against bad guy, good guy thinks bad guy is dead, he's not, then back for one last round. That being said the biggest part of the action is only in the last 33 minutes or so of the film, and its just not really that interesting.    The last battle sequence was also very short and disappointing as well, leaving you wanting more. Most films go over the top with it's drawn out endings but i thought this film needed it after an hour and a half of mediocrity. So this was a semi-blockbuster, but not nearly as much as the first, not to keep bring up that point but it was a lot more original. I also watched The Incredible Hulk(2008) and thought it was about 10 times better than this film. Also at the end of it Stark(Robert Downey Jr.) makes an appearance at the end making it like he will take care of the Incredible Hulk(problem) right at the end of the film. I've seen nothing in the works, but that would be quite a match-up, or a good nemesis. So lets hope there is not an Iron Man 3, but perhaps a vs type deal in the future. While the acting is good and its got all the elements to be a good film the Iron Man suit feels a little rusty this time around. As i said, good but lacking.    Also on one last note, why they do this i have no clue. Many films today show parts in previews that are NOT in the film. The part of the preview where Gweneth Paltrow is talking to R.D Jr., she gets annoyed and throws his helmet out of the plane, he says \\"you complete me\\" then jumps out. Its not in the film at all, at least not the one i watched. Strange.
B004259BMM|5.0|Just as other musicians are doing, Keith is offering a shorter disc of new music for a lower price,<br />so more people can afford to buy an album, not just one song.<br />I think 6.99 is a pretty good price for an album.<br />Also, many albums by tons of artists only have 9 or 10 songs.  Most of Keith's other albums have 13 songs.<br />The 14 song extra version at one particular store is a great purchase too.<br />You can read more from Keith about this new song packaging format here: [...]<br /><br />I love these new songs with the variety of instruments.<br />All of Keith's music always has great melody.  A lot of pop music is just all bass and thrashing guitar.<br />Melody is 75% of a song, for me.<br />I like the more acoustic, little more earthly country sound of this album.
B003TVMIDO|5.0|The discs are the original mixes, are not saturated in its sound, and clarity in each of the tracks. In the song \\"How do you sleep?, You may notice that your instruments and vocals are at the center, is a kind of hybrid between stereo and mono.

B002ZG99TA|5.0|This movie was very tense and suspenseful. It's literally like a roller-coaster ride. The unstoppable train almost seems like a character itself, like a fast monster. Washington and Pine star as Frank Barnes and Will Colson. Will is a rookie conductor and works with senior conductor Frank. The 777 train is being moved, but the air brakes are not hooked and it's set on the highest speed. The train yardmaster, Connie tries to figure out how to stop it, but it's going too fast and to make matters worse, the train is unmanned and carrying hazardous material. Soon, it's up to Will and Frank to stop the train before it reaches a highly populated area. I highly recommend UNSTOPPABLE!!!

I can understand he didn't want to be with her anymore but his child. I think this was just awful. Would never ever recommend the movie.
B00328R21C|5.0|These Legos are great!  Fun and relatively easy to put together.  My son was a little disappointed at the size of the item once it was built.  The size of the box and the cost of the toy lead you to believe that the finished product would be bigger, but overall it's a great Lego toy for a Star Wars fan.  Item was received quickly and in perfect condition by the seller.
0061876747|1.0|I did not buy Adam Kindred's decision to go underground.  A well-educated, logical person like him would have gone to the police and worked the situation out.  There is no way he would have signed into Wang's building if he was going to murder him.  This is a flimsy story that lost me within the first 15 pages.  I am a huge Boyd fan, and I have read all his previous novels.  What a disppointment!

B00408AN5A|5.0|After reading the book, The Compound Effect, I am more aware of my time and am programming myself to eliminate waste.  Darren impacted every area of my life, discipline, relationships, getting started, staying on track, and so much more.    The book is small and right to the point.  It's not filled with fluff, that other writers use to fill pages and bulk up the bindings.  People are busy and don't have time to spend wading through unnecessary dialog.  Darren gets right to the point and doesn't waste words to make his point.  He gives wonderful examples for better understanding.    There are model worksheets in the back which you can modify to your circumstances.  I feel this was a book of innovation -- a new way of marketing and a new way to look at life.    I'll be reading this book over and over.  I appreciate the book and Success Magazine.
B004259BMM|5.0|Being a long time fan of Keith Urban I was disappointed by the news that this CD would only include 8 songs. However, after seeing the price and listening once I'm completely happy. I feel this is album is one of Keith's best and in my opinion this CD holds hit after hit that will stand the test of time. I'm not understanding how anyone could think this CD is dull...but if it is dull.... I'll take dull any day! For those of you who can't swallow the fact that this only holds 8 songs there's a deluxe album being sold at Target with 3 more songs and a few live tracks, but in my opinion this is a great deal at less than $1.00 a song
B003NFM3JK|1.0|I had high hopes for this movie. I expect when I watch an animated movie from Disney with my children about Christmas I do not need to screen it ahead of time. I was appaled at how scary they made this movie. Did they really need to have Marley's jaw come unhinged and flop around..and his face rearrange. This movie scared the hell out of my 7 and 5 year old children. They said it should be called a Halloween Carol. To me it was just boring. I was so disappointed and ultimately a little angry that I had to spend the night up with my children who had nightmares over it.   I would not recommend this to children under 10 at all. From now on I will make sure I either watch it first or clear it with a friend that it is ok. It is a shame I have to do that with a cartoon. I was expected something warm and uplifting, like the Polar Express. This was the opposite of that. I HATED it.

1400082773|4.0|Dreams from My Father chronicles Barack Obama's journey as he struggles to find an equitable balance in multiple facets of his life.  Barack, the product of a white mother and a Kenyan father, attempts to define his racial identity, his faith and his calling.  What is also missing in his life is his father, Barack Sr.  During the formidable years of maturation when a father figure is integral, Barack relies on his maternal grandfather to fill that void.  Barack Sr. dies when Barack is 21 years old, leaving him with just one memory of ever meeting his father.<br /><br />The book is segmented into three parts: Origins, Chicago, and Kenya.  In Origins, after having spent several years in Indonesia with his mother, his mother's second husband and his half-sister, Barack returns to Hawaii and is raised by his maternal grandparents.  At one critical juncture, Barack decides to turn to reading and absorbing literature from noted African-American authors such as James Baldwin, W.E.B. Du Bois, Malcolm X (autobiography of), Ralph Ellison, Langston Hughes and Richard Wright.  In Chicago, we watch Barack as a community organizer navigate the ills of the South Side of Chicago.  Here, we also find Barack resolve his issues around faith, joining Rev. Jeremiah Wright's Trinity United Church of Christ.  In the final segment, Kenya, Barack ends his quest with a pilgrimage to the birthplace of his father.  Through the historical context provided by his Kenyan family, Barack is able to achieve closure and finally add a dose of reality to the Dream, the man, his father.

B001E45XT4|4.0|Pros:Great Price       Great Mic       Good sound quality       Comfortable but hurt when you eat wearing them       Awesome Padding       Mic can be hidden       strong build quality       Decent Durability (drop and step on many times)    Cons:low bass (what I expected from a headset less than 50)       Goes into Mono in low volumes       Padding is a dust magnet       Adjusting the size of headset is flimsy       Gigantic , don't plan no taking this outside or traveling   with it    All in all, best headset I used so far. The pros far outweigh its cons and the price is the deal closer. 9.5/10!
B001ECE6C6|5.0|Not sure what to expect when I ordered this. Went on Pat's reputation and the written word. However, I was not at all disappointed. This is one of the most beautiful collection of works I've heard. Pat's work is flawless, as usual. Anna, is nothing short of wonderful, an excellent collaboration. Line up, even though I hadn't heard of them, is fantastic. I had to give this one 5 stars!

020530902X|5.0|This small classic book tells us what every literate person should know about writing well. It consists of guidelines about punctuation, word choice, and grammar, for example, and is written with clarity and wit. It's greatest virtue is its humor.
B0044XV3R8|5.0|I just have to say to everyone who complains that the movie studios are taking advantage of us with all these new and different special editions.........    Who cares!!!  I LOVE this movie!!!!  If they crank out a new version every few months with 15 minutes each time I'll buy it.  I gave away my other version because you get all 3 versions here (4 counting the Family friendly Audio feature).  I will take that trip back to Pandora everytime I can, I watched the original 6 times the first weekend I went and I never get tired of watching.  I truely can not wait for the sequels, so for all you people out there who want a new and different trip to Pandora pick up a copy and join the journey.  For those of you with little ones who want to keep them from the strong language well here's your chance to let your little ones take that journey too.  What the box does not tell you to switch between the different versions you have to go into Set Up or you will automatically go straight into the theatrical version.  Once in set up you can choose between the different versions, other than that no problems or complaints from me.
B0036EH3WK|3.0|One corner of the box was already ripped before I first opened it. The part you take apart to get to the secret disc won't go back together because the cardboard is now frayed. Several discs refuse to play on my blu-ray player for some reason; all others are fine.    All in all, it's still a great box of goodies for an avid Lost fan. There are too many goodies not to get it, but the workmanship is not the greatest I've seen and the fact that several of the discs don't even work makes it a bit useless.
B002K0WBXW|4.0|You will find it funny, but in no way deep in any sense. Funny because it makes fun of the immigration service that is picking on silly details in the marriage between an American man and a Canadian woman who is being expelled because of an expired visa. And we are speaking of top executives in a publishing house. It is also funny because most of the film takes place in Alaska and the poor Canadian from Toronto does not exactly know how to react to eagles, waterways, family traditions and some other more exotic traditions. But apart from that it is schmaltzy to the extreme. It's a shame because they had a beautiful subject and the man like the woman, or the boy like the girl were good looking and we could have appreciated a little more skin contact. But it is fun for an evening when nothing is pressing in the oven or the washing machine.<br /><br />Dr Jacques COULARDEAU, University Paris 1 Pantheon Sorbonne, University Paris 8 Saint Denis, University Paris 12 Cr&eacute;teil, CEGID
0316066524|4.0|I won't lie.  I found this book too long, too big, too messy and occasionally too hard to follow.  Sometimes I even felt like I was being manipulated and messed with by the author.  But the good parts were funny, effortlessly clever and fun to read.  (Like the large section about things a person learns when he finds himself in a recovery facility.)  The footnotes were ridiculous, and not in a good way.  They didn't add to my experience as a reader.  If anything, they detracted from it.  Despite all that, I really like this book.  Though it's hard to say why.

0375507256|5.0|This book starts off strange.  if you've never read any of David Mitchell's work, you probably stand a chance of putting it down and forgetting about it.  However, once you make it through to the third chapter the throughline becomes evident and you'll find yourself barreling through the book desperate to see what happens next.    It's truly one of the best books I've ever read, right up there with Murakami's \\"Wind-up Bird\\" and Robbins' \\"Skinny Legs and All.\\"
B002XTBE6K|5.0|I love Jane Austen books and movies.  But when I saw this Emma on PBS I was very impressed!  I finally ordered the DVDs recently and it's just as good as I remembered.  I love that the longer screen time in a mini-series means that they can work in little details that a two hour movie just can't fit in.  Lovely!  If you like Jane Austen films, you won't regret this one!  It's really on par with the classic Pride and Predjudice mini-series!  :)

0446195529|5.0|I love the Camel Club books.  I would have liked a little more involvement of the full \\"club\\" in this book.  I would normally give it 4 stars, but I'm giving it an extra star for the Kindle pricing.    I wish the Kindle versions were more expensive than the hardcover version.  They're worth more to me because we avoid cutting down trees, the energy cost of making paper, the dioxins created in the bleaching process, the printing and transportation energy costs, the cost of fuel to ship the book to me, and finally I don't have to find a place to store the book.  If you're creative you can even share the book with family or close friends.    The lower carbon footprint and convenience of being able to carry a whole library with me are fantastic.      Amazon, please raise the price of the Kindle books!    Thanks,    Basil

B004BC7MRM|1.0|Needs to change his name from kid rock to kid country.  Always thought that Kid didn't get credit for all of his talent in the early years because of the type of music he sang.  That said I was a fan because of the type of music he sang!  Think this is probably good if you like this kind of music.  I don't, I liked the fist pumping, make no excuses, take no prisoners anthems of old.  His choice to make a transition from good to this...my choice to stop wasting my time anticipating his next album.  Last one was unacceptable...this one untolerable.
B001IBIHQ4|1.0|As a huge fan of Band of Brothers and virtually all of Tom Hanks's works, but I found \\"Pacific\\" to be filled with EXTREMELY anti-American scenes. If I wasn't familiar with the US role in WWII, I would come away from this movie thinking how evil the Americans were and very sympathetic to our enemies. Hanks even made mention of this when the series was in production.     As far as realistic, forget it. The series is centered on characters of no significance that add NOTHING to the series. Apparently, they thought it would make it more \\"female\\" friendly than Band of Brothers. The story line is stupid and it also shows Americans in a bad light. They skip Iwo Jima completely and Guadalcanal and Peleliu appear to be years apart. Don't expect to gain any historical perspective from this.       If Tom Hanks wanted to show how much he hates America, this is a great start. I advise any WWII vets to have your meds nearby before you watch this trash. This is another America bashing war movie along the lines of \\"Casualties of War\\". I would sell it to get my money back, but I cannot in good conscience be a part of someone else watching this garbage. Where is the ZERO stars option because this series needs it.
0470449748|5.0|There's not much to say about this.  The book covers all the topics thoroughly, and provided a good review prior to taking the GMAT.  I recommend this resource to anyone who is planning on taking the GMAT.

0316098337|5.0|Room / 978-0-31612-911-4<br /><br />I'd never heard of Emma Donoghue before this book was picked for a monthly book club meeting I was invited to. From all the 'mystery' surrounding the book going in, I wasn't sure what to expect, but it was easy to pick up on the premise immediately in the first couple of pages, after having read a biography about the infamous [[ASIN:0007300565 Josef Fritzl]] earlier in the year. What really makes this novel fascinating and horrifying is that the whole point of view is told from the child who has never seen or heard of anything outside of \\"Room\\", rather than, say, from the mother's point of view, as in the also excellent [[ASIN:0312595670 Still Missing]].<br /><br />I have to say that I'm tremendously impressed with the writing style in \\"Room\\"; Donoghue seems almost instinctively aware how to not beat about the bush, and provides just enough horrifying and heart-breaking details before swiftly moving the reader along. Indeed, at approximately 250 pages, a fast reader can finish \\"Room\\" on a long afternoon - and probably will, because they will find the book impossible to put down. The characters are well-handled and thoroughly realistic - although Jack and his mother might have come off as frustrating in another author's hands, they are always deeply sympathetic throughout the novel as they struggle to come to grips with a world that is bigger and more different than they had expected.<br /><br />I would recommend \\"Room\\" strongly to anyone with an interest in psychology, captivity, and/or \\"true crime\\" novelizations. It's a sad but true fact that Donoghue mentions passingly through her characters: Jack's story is not unique. But in \\"Room\\", his story is well told and a heart-breaking reminder of all the things we readers are so lucky to take for granted.<br /><br />~ Ana Mardoll
B0042JTDXK|1.0|This album sucks!  I could blather on about how great Josh's voice is, how heartfelt and profound his compositions are, the angst of finding love and still could not come up with a decent enough excuse for this turd of a CD.   The Grobanites posting the orgasmic reviews of this CD are either doing so out of misguided love and loyalty for their curly haired cutie pie or they are simply deaf.       I'm not one to expect any artist to sing the same old stuff album after album.  Josh definitely stretched his singing chops with the work he did with Lady Blacksmith Mambazo and the cool, hip, jazz piece \\"Machine\\" all from Closer.  Now that was cool.  It wasn't the same old Power Ballads that made him famous or the Foster Sugar Schlock.  But Illuminations makes it difficult to believe that Josh spent five years slaving over musical compositions and arrangements and the best he could come up with was this piece of crap.  What's even more ballsy is the price of the \\"Internet Edition\\" he's selling on his exclusive fan club.  $39.99 for this plus two additional digital downloads.  And why not?  The four to five star reviews posted just here proves that he can clear his throat and his devoted Grobanites will applaud him.    What this album sounds like is that Josh goofed off for five years and told his fans he was slaving over the bestest-ever-in-the-world-CD-just-for-them and he knows they're stupid enough to believe him.  At the last minute, he moves to New York, putters about and then pukes up some whining, whinging, angst-ridden, lonely-in-New-York-looking-for-love pabulum that only Grobanites find palatable.    Groban is better than this.
0811876373|5.0|These a harder to make than expected.  I guess I need practice.  I tried making the pumokins and the orange melts were difficult to work with and the wilton color pens did not work.
B002HJ9PTO|4.0|I have to say it seems like a lot of people didn't know what they were getting when they purchased this microphone.  This mic will not instantly make your recording better and may not fit your needs.  Its a decent, inexpensive microphone (just checked my levels on Final Cut Express, right in the yellow like they should be).  I like the cable is generously long (to put it mildly), it allows either you or subject a lot of freedom in where you place your camera and freedom of movement for the subject.  Obviously its not the most durable mic, but again you're paying almost a tenth the cost of a pro lav.  If you get one that doesn't perform right out of the box, just return it for a refund.<br />I bought this to make simple presentations with my pentax k7 and my macbook.  I am more than satisfied with this inexpensive solution.
0439023483|5.0|I was late in the game with these books having just finished all three about 2 weeks ago. I must say that I was completely blown away by them.    The first in the series introduces you to Katniss Everdeen. She volunteers to take her sister's place in the Hunger Games and her life forever changes. It takes you on her journey from District 12 to the Capitol and back. I don't want to spoil anything if you haven't read them yet so I'll just say that it was an amazing ride. There was so much raw emotion, sadness, fear and yet a sense of hope. I felt like I lived in the world of Panem right along with them. I was completely in love and refused to put this book down.    Suffice it to say that this is a must read.
B001R0KH3W|4.0|Strongly recommended for those who like Stevie Wonder´s songs. Great images and sounds, it's like you are in the stage with the band. If it had subtitles and extras, I would rank it with five stars.
B003NFM3JK|5.0|I think the movie is fabulous, however the DVD is not. I found three skips in the disc before the opening credits were completed, and brought it back to WalMart for a replacement. The replacement does the same thing, but I sat through it and logged 9 glitches altogether, not counting a screen freeze that required ejecting the disc and restarting it. WalMart will only replace this defective disc with another defective disc so I guess I'll have to go to Disney with a complaint.  For those interested in comparing notes on this... the glitches (short freeze ups) are located at:    4:32  7:25  !6:58  25:49  44:54  45:36  107:33  107:35  110:18

B002VPE1WK|4.0|I know Amazon SELLS great products, but I was a little skeptical purchasing a product MADE by Amazon. However, I've been pleasantly surprised.<br /><br />I initially purchased the bag thinking that I was going to \\"fill it up\\" with my Nikon D300 and 4 lenses. Boy was I wrong! Not only was I able to get my camera and 4 lenses in the bag, but I was also able to fit: an iPad (+ two cases), a pair of Bose Headphones, an iPad dock, an iPhone dock, an iPad charger, an iPhone charger, 4 extra camera batteries, a nikon battery charger, plus an assortment of other cables and adapters. With all of this, there was STILL room for maybe one or two more lenses!<br /><br />The bag is very well padded and securely attaches to you using two straps that clip around your chest and waist. While using it for the first time, it felt so securely attached to me that I felt comfortable enough sprint a few times with it on my back. This leads to the only complaint I have about the bag. The padded dividers are held in place by velcro, but the weight of the camera and lenses (coupled with my sprinting) was enough to cause the velcro to come undone. When I eventually opened the bag, the camera and lenses had all shifted into a \\"pile\\" in the bottom of the bag (though nothing was damaged). I realize that it was my own fault for sprinting with $3000 of camera equipment on my back, but I figure I'd warn others about what could happen. :-)
B0040JHXTI|5.0|My 23 year old son just left.  Earlier he called and said he \\"had something for me\\"....when I opened the box and saw this collection I could only go over it in wonderment. My favorite Bruce album remastered with new gems never heard before.  The six pocket notebook full of handwritten lyrics.... photos and glimpses of what brought this masterpiece of an album all together for the masses to soak up.  The Live performances that are priceless!    While I am still digesting it all, I can only say I have seen Bruce perform with my son and love that his music continues to reach over generations....A gift for generations. Some things truly can only be found in the darkness on the edge of town.

0596806027|4.0|HTML5: Up and Running by Mark Pilgrim  Summary:    This book gives a good introduction to HTML5, how it evolved and where it is heading with respect to adoption by different by various browsers available in the market. The author takes a humorous path in explaining how different the current browsers are and the pain the developers have to go through to make the code compatible in all the browsers. You need to have a good understanding of HTML before you can read this book. It is an easy read and helps you grasp several important technologies adopted by HTML5.  My Reactions:   Chapter 1 talks about how HTML evolved over time and how various standard committees governing HTML were formed. It gives a good foundation on what's happening in HTML world. Chapter 2 is entirely dedicated to detecting HTML5 features. Mark makes a good point of how each feature is different and needs its own detecting methodology.    This book gives good introduction to canvas element and suggests links for further reading. It delves into different video technologies available in the market and how to create videos in these different formats. I enjoyed reading the chapter which talks about the new input types available in HTML5 for form tag. It talks about how geolocation and internal storage is done in HTML5.   Overall the book is an easy read and helps you understand how different features of HTML5 work.  [...]
0321334876|5.0|This book concentrates on the whys and hows of designing classes, and using C++'s syntactic features to express the way a class is intended to be used. As such, it is an insightful guide into the part of C++ that is most unique to the language among modern OO languages.    I highly recommend this book to intermediate-level C++ engineers who are seeking to grow toward expertise, as well as engineers who want to develop their class design skills.    The material in this book (and its sequel, to a lesser extent) is the crux of the difference between \\"an OO programmer who knows C++\\" and \\"A C++ expert\\".

006112429X|2.0|Shriver's writing is beautiful.  She can poignantly describe a mundane encounter and infuse meaning into what are otherwise simple situations.  The question of what brings a child to assasinate his fellow students and teachers is one worth exploring.  But the narrator of this story is his mother, an egocentric woman who muses for 470 pages about wanting and not wanting a child, having a difficult child, hating her child, hating her husband, both loving and hating her job. It's tedious.  I stopped reading after 150 pages and skipped ahead to see where the book goes, but it was just a continuation of the same depressing diatribe.  The characters don't change, grow, or provide insight into life. It's a shame that such talented writing was wasted on the composition of this book.
159102594X|3.0|The Blade Itself is more or less what I expect from fantasy novels these days with one notable exception: Inquisitor Glokta.  If ever there was a book made entirely by one character it is this one.  An unusual, almost out of place character reminiscent of some of George R.R. Martin's more unusual cast members, the Inquisitor stands out amidst an otherwise unremarkable cast of recognizably cliched characters.<br /><br />Aside from Glokta, this book is a 2-3 star book that I wouldn't necessarily recommend.  The main reasons for this are as follows:<br /><br />1. Some of the characters aren't exactly believable and few inspired any kind of response from me at all (hate, concern, etc).  Most could have been replaced by silent cattle lurking in the background and I wouldn't have even noticed.<br /><br />2. While his world is intriguing, it is ultimately underdeveloped.  Worse still, there were elements of the plot that just seemed thrown together to fill pages.  \\"We need to travel to the end of the world?  Why?\\"  \\"Why not?  We have two more books to go in this series.\\"<br /><br />Overall a mediocre book except that Glokta largely saves the day.  He proves unique, insightful, and proof that Abercrombie has promise despite a cast of mostly unimpressive forgettable characters doing unimpressive things.  I found myself impatiently waiting to get through all the filler between one Glokta chapter and the next.  For him alone, this book is worth recommending.<br /><br />As a note: the ending was painfully obvious and falls flat despite the supposed \\"twist\\" it was no doubt supposed to be.  Abercrombie shows good instinct but hasn't fully realized it yet.
B003EYVXXW|5.0|This is an outstanding movie, unfortunately in order to appreciate it one should be enthusiastic about history, power politics, mass movements, the classical history of science, and have some knowledge of mathematical astronomy, otherwise it could be taken as anti-Christian propaganda.  Because of these perquisites its audience is probably going to be very, very small, probably in the dozens.  That said, if historical drama and intellectual stimulation is your cup of tea, this movie is for you.  Be forewarned, this movie is a tragedy unless religious repression and violence is also your cup of tea.    One thing, although I am confident the movie makers did a reasonable portrayal of the power politics of the time, I question whether anyone can be certain of the fate of Hypathia.  History is at best a lie agreed upon.  I read another interpretation Hypathia's death that has her dying at an old age.      That said I going to buy the DVD, and I am not one of those people whose buys DVDs of movies.
B00475BUVM|1.0|So with the limited number of 3-D movies out there and wanting to make a purchase other than another animated half-rate movie available on 3-D format, I was hoping to put my expensive investment to something more adult like.  With hopes, I purchased \\"Clash of the Titans\\" Blu Ray in 3-D.  I was really looking forward to the film and being amazed because the two animated movies I have, \\"Monsters vs Aliens\\" and \\"Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs\\" are quite enjoyable in 3-D.     As soon as I put \\"Clash\\" into the Blu Ray player, I wondered if there was something wrong with my glasses.  I changed the batteries on my glasses, tried different pairs of glasses, and even checked to make sure I had the correct disc in the drive.  Everything seemed to be working.  I even replaced the disc with one \\"Monsters vs...\\" just to make sure my TV had not broken down.  The result is this: I do not believe that \\"Clash of the Titans\\" was even made into a 3-D version.  If you are hoping to be amazed with your TV's 3-D display capabilities, you better buy something else.  All \\"Clash\\" is, is simply a blurred background with no, AND I MEAN NO, 3-D imagery.  In fact, I am so disappointed, I plan on returning it (I hope) tomorrow.    Don't get me wrong.  I think \\"Clash..\\" is a fairly decent movie for entertainment.  But if you are looking for 3-D graphics, spend your hard earned cash elsewhere.

B00368Q3UY|5.0|This is an incredible device that amazes everyone who sees, hears, and touches it. This is by far the best small portable speaker in the world and thats without even mentioning that its also an mp3 player! Its very fun to toss around and play with while listening to music or by just setting it on a table. The great thing about it is no cords (although you can plug your mp3 player/ipod into it) are required and it is definitely the most portable and powerful bang for your buck speaker you can buy. You would be foolish to buy any other small speaker. You will be wowed the first time you hear it. Very impressive product, cant stress this enough!

031603438X|5.0|A fascinating revelation about Keef's amazing and colorful life and in particular his tough childhood in Dartford, getting his first guitar and early influences on his musical style. A very conversational read as if he's chatting with you in person, the kind of book you don't want to put down, \\"oh maybe just another few pages\\", and before you know it you've gone through 20 more. Amazing anecdotes about the early days and meeting the other Stones, playing with other contemporary musicians and blues greats, plus the key influences of meeting Ian Stewart and then Andrew Loog Oldham who helped them turn the corner from being just messengers spreading the word of rhythm and blues to the path of fame and fortune. There are even excerpts from Keef's diary when they first got going detailing how much money they got paid for each gig and how they managed when they needed amps, instruments, transport and often had to choose between that and eating! Then came steady gigs, record contracts, tours and money and the stories just get wilder and crazier and more fascinating. A thoughtful and insightful narrative that satisfies one's curiosity about Keef and the Stones as they are as people then and now, what their roots were and how they got to where they are today, what a long strange trip it's been, and, luckily for us, continues to be. It's only rock and roll but I like it!
159562015X|5.0|This book is necessary to take and understand the StrengthsFinders 2.0 assessment test. The key to the online testing is included in the back of the book; every test must have a key to be processed which means a book has to be purchased for everyone in your family who wants to take the test. At first I found that irritating, why not discount the key with proof of purchase of one book and let multiple family members take the test? But as I used this book over and over to contemplate my own test results and those of my friends, I realized that everyone does need their own copy for notes and musings. Clearly set up to cover the results of the test, I found it enjoyable just to read all of the 'themes' and suggested actions Gallup has created to work at your best level of satisfaction and help others work to their highest, enjoyable potential.
0374531269|5.0|I bought this as a required read for my son's English class.  I thought I would start it before he had to use it in class.  It is a very good story.  I keep asking if he is done with it in class so I can finish.  I highly recommend this book.
B004132HZS|5.0|Whether you watched the series on PBS, or are a fan of the original Conan Doyle stories, buy this DVD!  It's a terrific new portrayal and the cast is perfect.  There are lots of \\"through-puts\\" and references to the original texts as well as tips of the hat to previous media versions.  I highly recommend that you access the special features (after viewing the shows first of course as there are spoilers) which include commentaries by the creator/producing team and the two leads.  Plus there is the 60 minute version of \\"A Study in Pink,\\" which when viewed back to back, I think give an absolutely fascinating peek at the creative process.  You see, with the retelling in the 90 minute version, what was kept, changed or thrown out.  The commentaries may require a bit of concentration due to the rapid pace, but they are just as commentaries on DVDs should be, a kind of insider behind the scenes tour of the production.  And quite frankly Benedict Cumberbatch's dead-on impression of Alan Rickman made me laugh out loud.  Don't be put off by the fact that the stories are set in the 21st century, after all in reading the books, you quickly realize that Sir Arthur was writing about men who were very much slightly ahead of their own times.  The choice to include Watson's back story as an Afghanistan veteran, which is straight out of the original A Study in Scarlet, was perfect.  It not only establishes the characters in both today, while recognizing the history and emphasizes that the more things change the more they stay the same!  I also agree with the co-creators only obliquely referring to Holmes previous drug use, but stating clearly that Holmes has no use for his body other than as transporting his brain from crime to solution as efficiently as possible.  This clear asexual mind-set, in our post modern high-sexualized culture, makes Holmes in Sherlock as intriguing and exotic as he must have been to the Victorians when he was introduced in 1887!  I can't wait for the next round!!

0061703257|5.0|This great novel by Dennis Lehane starts out as a locked room mystery, but quickly shifts to something more.  There are lots of twists throughout the story.  If I hadn't seen the movie trailer before reading the book, I probably wouldn't have expected the ending (I haven't seen the movie yet, but the trailer gives pretty much everything away).  I highly recommend the book.  I also recommend you skip the movie/movie trailer before you read it, so as not to spoil the surprises.

If u call urself a Chili Pepper fan and havn't seen this, you might as well give up on LIFE! Ok, but in all seriousness, this is the best concert i'v ever seen in my entire life
B000PKG7I4|5.0|Great Amy Winehouse album! I first heard Back to Black, loved that album, then bought this album, and love this album even more! I love Amy's vocals. Each song is different, each has a different tone, which is refreshing. Some are slow, fast, R&B-like, pop-like - excellent album!
B004B4RCDE|4.0|Although, I don't think Loud grabs my attention as Rated R did, but, wow, another fantastic album.  I just love everything about Rihanna.  Her style, she is so beautiful, her voice sounds almost angelic.  I recommend anyone who is a fan, get it.  I had hoped that Rihanna would stay on the dark side like she flirted with on Rated R, but it's clear she is in a much better place in her life so we really can't expect her to continue that theme.  Great album, I really love that song with Drake, track favorites are track 2 3 9 10.  I just put these on repeat & let them play over & over again.
B0042816YK|3.0|once again, as in all her films, you can't get past the fact that it's Julia Roberts playing Julia Roberts and not the character.   The book was so darn good and the movie itself is a great filming experience and all the other actors did a fine job.  If only the audience could forget and not see all of Julia's expressions and mannerisms, the huge mouth and laugh, it would be rated excellent by me.  The Julia cackle has come into every single part she has ever played and when that happens, the viewer is brought out of the film and back to Julia.  We know she has a huge laugh and bigger than normal smile but other actors have an English accent or whatever and they change that for a film and make their characters be the characters.   Julia can't do that or maybe she can and just doesn't.   Every person she plays can't have a cackle in their character, can they???   Other than that, the film is just fine..the story, of course, knowing the book, is enjoyable.
B002VPE1XE|5.0|This basic little camera case is sturdy and takes abuse without falling apart.  The zippers and seams have held together admirably, and the fabric and lining look brand new even after months of use. The case is well padded, which protected my camera during numerous tumbles and falls.     The main compartment closes with a velcro flap, and it holds well.  The velcro flap has never failed or let my camera fall out.    I like the extra little zipper pocket on the front for carrying small items like picture memory cards, and the carry strap is useful and strong.  I haven't used the belt loop, but it is of very strong webbing and velcro, looks like it would hold up well too.      The case is not outfitted with a vast array of features, but with the price Amazon is selling this case for, I'd definitely rank it as a best buy.
0553805371|4.0|Stephen Hawking and Leonard Mlodinow present a thought-provoking look at a subject that is hard for the layman to grasp.
B003UERZ88|4.0|\\"Made of metal\\" is the third all original studio album by the Metal God Rob Halford eight years past his last original album \\"Crucible\\". The line up features original \\"Halford\\" members guitarist Mike Chlasciak and drummer Bobby Jarzombeck alongside guitarist/producer Roy Z and bass player Mike Davis.<br /><br />In terms of direction \\"Made of Metal\\" takes a considerable turn from the heavy/speed metal approach of the preceding two albums. Most would agree that his highly acclaimed solo debut, \\"Resurrection\\" was made under the example of the iconic \\"Painkiller\\" record; in contrast \\"Made of metal\\" recaptures the essence of his early-mid 80s Priest works, very much in line with \\"Screaming for vengeance\\", \\"Defenders of the Faith\\" and a bit of \\"Point of Entry\\".<br /><br />Subsequently one should expect standard to mid tempo songs for the biggest part of the album, while the high pitched vocal parts are substantially reduced with Halford utilizing mostly his mid and bass vocal range. Therefore one could claim that \\"Made of Metal' is essentially a melodic metal album. I would also like to stand on the contribution of Roy Z; playing guitar, co writing and producing the album, Roy has a huge effect on the development of \\"Made of metal\\". While the vocals and lyrics are undisputedly Priest, the instrumental melodies, choruses and solos are too reminiscent of Roy's previous works including \\"Driver\\" and Rob Rock's solo work. Favorite tracks include, \\"Fire and ice\\", \\"Speed of sound», «Like there's no tomorrow\\" and \\"We own the night\\".<br /><br />Above all what the album may lack in terms of speed and aggression, more than makes up in melody and dramatic performaces by Halford and company. \\"Made of metal\\" definitely sounds fresh and differentiated from the Metal God's previous solo works therefore avoiding repetition while still referencing his \\"Priest side\\".
B0040JHXTI|5.0|I've been waiting impatiently for this one.  Talk about worth the wait!  Let's start with the remastered Darkness on the Edge of Town cd.  This album, originally released in 1978, stands as one of Springsteen's most powerful artistic statements.  Many elements of Darkness benefit from the remastering, such as Roy Bittan's piano (especially his Floyd Cramer-esque playing on \\"Factory\\"), Garry Tallent's bass work, and Springsteen's blistering, howling guitar solos on \\"Adam Raised a Cain\\" and \\"Streets of Fire.\\"  The title track may be The Boss's defining moment on record, and this may be his defining album -- exuberant, angry, desperate, and triumphant.    The two cds of Darkness outtakes, called The Promise, are most welcome.  Springsteen added some vocals and instrumentation to some of the tracks.  I will admit that, personally, I would rather have them in their original forms, but I'm just glad to have these songs in remastered, clean versions.  \\"The Promise\\" is one of Springsteen's finest songs; it should have been released decades ago (I am not counting the rerecorded version on 18 Tracks).  Other highlights for me are \\"Outside Looking In\\" and \\"Wrong Side of the Street.\\"  There's not a bad track to be found on The Promise.    The dvds are a fine addition.  I'm a sucker for music documentaries, so I am very happy to have \\"The Promise: The Making of Darkness on the Edge of Town.\\"  The dvds of live performances and in-studio performances are very good; I especially enjoy the New York '78 version of \\"The Promise.\\"  It overflows with passion and commitment.  No wonder he's called The Boss.    Everything about this set, from the packaging to the material, is a textbook example of what a great box set should be.  It is beyond amazing.  It is some of the finest rock and roll ever realized.  Get it.
