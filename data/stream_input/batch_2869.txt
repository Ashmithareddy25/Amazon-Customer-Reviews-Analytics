B002RI97IY|5.0|Tolle's book 'A New Earth' is an incredibly powerful book for those who are ready to look within and become the people they are meant to be. His wisdom captivates the heart to change. Opportunities to reflect on how to implement these changes within ourselves are offered in a way that one cannot refuse if you have reached that moment in your life when you know there is no other option but TO CHANGE! Incredibly enlighting. You will not be the same once you've read it.
B001JYEMOQ|4.0|This movie is very drama related from one situation to another. The ending of the movie is kind of weird but maybe there will be another movie to continue it.
0345803507|3.0|Wow, I have to admit that I am so glad this series is finally over and there will never, ever be any more of Christian or Ana to read about in the future.<br />In my opinion, this story dragged on for far too long and this was only because of a truck-load of repetition that was starting to make me angry about reading it.<br />Truthfully, I was totally over Ana's constant immaturity and supposed asserting of her independence, Christian's constant insecurity and dominating nature and the sex scenes were getting to the point of being ridiculous, especially since there was one at almost every fifth page or so.<br />If I ever hear anyone exclaim 'Oh My!' or talk about their Inner Goddess again, I will most likely turn and walk the other way.<br />The only reason I ended up finishing this series was because I already had this book at home and wanted to just get it over and done with.<br />At least now I can say I have read them and can move on with my life. I feel so free!
B00CTSDDVO|1.0|I was going to buy this for myself because I enjoyed the movie. But then I heard that the \\"extra's\\" on this set are minimal. There are additional features depending if you buy the DVD from Best Buy or Target. (And what they offer is different than the other.)<br /><br />The worse offense is that the commentary is only accessible if you buy it off of iTunes!?<br /><br />This is just an insult to the consumer. I won't be buying this DVD.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I love hidden object games but this has far too much dialogue. Enjoy the different games until got to level 16 and stalled on me. Just keeps loading and the clock counting down. Overall could be better but ok.
B00E5Q1LTY|5.0|This movie is pretty darn good. I can't stop watching it. Definitely worth buying. One of the better movies that has come out recently. Good to know that JJ Abrams will be doing the new Star Wars.
B0001AP13A|1.0|i recieved this item and i opened it brand new and it was warped, it skips because it is warped so bad,<br /> I was very disapointed.<br />this is my favorite Kanye album and when i saw it was on vinyl i had to get it.<br />now i cant even listen to it on my record player its just an expensive wall record.
B009UAO1ZG|3.0|The author's prose style is excellent, which makes this a compelling read, and  very easy to understand.  Although I realize many people in the United States believed in eugenics, and many empathized with Germany's handling of their \\"Jewish Problem\\" it is hard to dismiss Lindbergh's underlying acceptence of those attitudes as the norm for his time considerng how much influence Lindbergh had in America.  I haven't finished the book yet, but suspect that my attiude towards the book is not going to change.<br />It is understandable after the kidnapping that Lindbergh would have searched for order, yet understanding, and excusing are two different concepts. Itis difficult for me to accept the author's basic premise, and I did not notice the scholarship to convince me to change my mind.
6305511055|5.0|Intrigue at its best. A really good story not needing pages of dialogue.  Good casting with plenty of action and surprises.
159463176X|4.0|Hosseini is such a talented  writer. I enjoyed his last two pieces and even taught Kite Runner in the classroom some years ago.
B000SZK41M|5.0|Close too perfection in a action movie as you can get. Never gets old. Who else is bad ass enough to run barefoot on glass!
B005XQLBU4|5.0|And i'm realy bored. All you do is shoot missiles that explode in color when upgraded. Not really worth it.
B0044KI79S|5.0|This series is a very interesting and come back for more series. Seasin Six is as great as the rest...now onto Season Seven.
B0008ENHTE|5.0|A classic. Never goes out of style. No matter how often it is viewed there is always something new to notice.
B004V6MWFU|2.0|I Luv all kinds of music but this did not do a thing for me I thought it would be a little more rock and roll!!!
B00992CF6W|1.0|It has so many bugs in 0.7.4, like the fact that the tools always look like a pick axe, and they sort of fan out when ever you scroll over a certain block or item. I won't play minecraft again until you fix that. &gt;:(
B00BEXB18M|3.0|For a band who tried to go back to their roots with this album seemed to have failed at doing so. Each track seems sluggish and muddy. Mustaine also seems to have gone lazy on the vocals sounding like he is just slurring the words and barely does any screaming. This album is definitely not their best work but lets hope that the next album will have more improvements.
B0064X7FVE|4.0|Works well.  Would like more options.  A weather map view would be nice. Would like to see barometric pressure, and high and low temperatures for the day.
B009XIXVU6|2.0|After Kite Runner, I expected a book that would capture my imagination and take me to a world that is completely different than ours.  This book failed to do that.
B007Y36K46|5.0|OK...If you have a closed mind this movie is not for you...But..If you believe almost anything is possible then this movie might resonate with you as being something close to a true reality....Of course the movie is not an exacting truth but has many of symbolic like plays off of deeper truths...Because if man can think it God already did to an even higher level...SO...A little bit of sci-fi...A little bit of action...No drugs or swearing or uncouth things...A little old America not really accurate...But a tale of the good team beating the bad guys in the end...I thoroughly enjoyed this movie and rank it as one of my favorite all time...
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Very nice app.  Does what it's supposed to do.  Themes are nice.  Very good autocorrect leads to very fast error free texting.
B00BQ1D7X4|5.0|This album certainly brings me back to the \\"Jar of Flies\\" \\"Dirt\\" days. This album certainly has quite a number of hits on this album such as \\"Stone\\" \\"Hollow\\" and \\"Voices\\". Despite not having Layne Staley on Lead Vocals anymore (his second album absent) William Duval still does a good job, especially on the harmonies with Jerry Cantrell.
B009UX2YAC|4.0|It is very good get it Lolo go get it now lol whattup dawgs Celtic are the best actress Milan barca and ajax
B009XIXVU6|5.0|I have read each of Mr. Hosseini's books; they are all remarkable.  Each story within the book was engaging. I regret that  I did not make a diagram of the relationships between the characters.  The author writes great clarity and the characters are well developed and engaging.
B00D6CPTMS|4.0|very nice the package and congratulations for the time of receiving, I considere this product a limited one production then I'am very proud to got it and I thank you so much
B00AAX68HG|3.0|I didn't think this would be very fun but, ZeptoLab did it again. The game is very fun. You slide pudding to make them into one.<br />It would of got a 5 star, but the adds are so annoying. They constantly pop up. Otherwise a fun game.
B0083ZRAJS|4.0|Never loses its mastery of metaphors in life.<br />Always worth another read.<br />And yes, it is better than watching a movie!
B005ZMUXDC|5.0|My daughter LOVES this movie and sings along with all the little musicals! Very cute little girl movie! 2 year old and mommy approved!
B00C061HZY|5.0|I know people normally want a giant review that goes into detail, and to be honest, anything I can say has already been said here.  Daft Punk produces near perfection, and this is no different.  The music is second to none, and to let it go over that edge this is an incredible vinyl!  The packaging itself is a work of art, and you also get a code for the digital version.  This is worth every penny, and even if you are only a slight fan of Daft Punk, you cannot go wrong with this for the price.  I am not exaggerating when I say that I would have spend double the amount on this, and it would have been worth it.
B0097EWK3A|5.0|The game is difficult and challenging, but that is what makes it exciting.  The game is mysterious and fun. It is absolutely the best game I have played this year.
B0058VW36U|4.0|It's a great app.  Also, if you want to play with no adds, just disable the wifi.  It works.  Try it.
B00CXQL828|5.0|Amazing,Melodic,Hard Rock Masterpiece! I love this genre of music and these three guys are the best at what they do! I'm really excited as many fans are about this band. This is the music are youth should be listening to!!!
B00BHUB11Y|5.0|My daughter has watched this movie at least 20 times and loves it! Perfect road trip movie for the little ones.
193700788X|4.0|This is the final novel in the SOOKIE STACKHOUSE series.  Those who only know this series from HBO's TRUE BLOOD and/or have not read the earlier books in this series should not begin with this one.  There is a very strong story arc to the series, so the novels really do need to be read in order.  The TV series, while based on the early novels, diverges quite markedly from the books so watching the series is not a substitute for reading the books.<br /><br />The action picks up shortly after the events described in DEADLOCKED.  Sookie now has to face the consequences of her choices and, once again, attempt to get on with her life.  The trouble is that once again it seems as though somebody is trying to end it.  Just who is it that was framed Sookie for murder?  Could the two mysterious strangers that have been spotted around town have something to do with it?  As Sookie, aided by an amazing group of allies, sorts out the confusion she finds out some things that surprise even her.<br /><br />This has been a very long running series, one with an extremely large and varied cast of characters.  As with any such series readers have developed strong opinions about how the plot lines should be resolved, some of them totally disagreeing with the vision Harris held for the series.  In the end though this is Harris' work, and she alone gets to decide how it all ends.  We readers can only be happy for the wonderful stories she has shared with us.<br /><br />There will be a follow up book, one that has been called a 'c-o-d-a' (I have to spell it that way since auto correct keeps changing it) that will be a sort of 'where are they now?' type of book which should tie up any remaining loose ends.
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|Do not take it seriously. Just sit back and enjoy the mayhem. A movie to make an escape from reality
B003FSTN5C|5.0|So it got here in great time and it looks perfect! I could not be more happy! Thanks for a great product for a great price!!
0345529057|5.0|Love the series. Interesting and exciting to read, keeps you enthralled. I'm watching the series as I complete the books. Love the shows and the books, but of course the books have more details. It's definitely worth reading them first and then watching!!
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|While the second book is better than the first for sure, I felt like the third book was a little rushed. Still very enjoyable.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I never caught this program when it began and after some years on the air, I was able to<br />watch it on Amazon Instant Video and I'm happy I have.<br />Great cast, and good story lines.
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|I like the descriptions of personalities and the way that different people experienced the same event. I like it as much as &#34;Pride and Prejudice&#34; and &#34;Sense and Sensibility&#34;.
6305428050|5.0|An awesome old-fashioned movie, great for the family. No sex,nudity, blood, guts or language. Just old-fashioned, innocent fun...<br />Brand-new VHS tape still in the package
B000002B1M|5.0|Nas is ine of the greatest for a reason, he's a lyricist and I'm 19 there's nothing like Good Hip Hop Music people who are talking about things.
B00BVYNSLC|5.0|I read a review of this show somewhere (where escapes me) but thought I should give it a try, so bought it from Amazon.<br />This is truly an original show.  At first it starts out like just a mystery, but the deeper you get into it, you realize that it is really well written and acted science fiction.  The actors are great, they are very believable, which is paramount to making good sci-fi movies or television.<br />Most sci-fi that falls flat is because of either a: totally bizarre writing (so far outside the realm of believability that you just can't stay with it), or b: acting that leaves you cold and uncaring, or c: a combination of the two.<br />This is once sci-fi show that is extremely well written and expertly acted.  Highly recommend this show to anyone that likes great sci-fi mysteries.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|This has been a standard on my bookshelf for ever.  The publishers keep up with the times.<br />As the language changes, they have kept abreast of the added meanings.
B008476HBM|4.0|This is an amusing book with very nice, detailed descriptions of characters and events. An excellent classic that must be read.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|Works just fine on my kindle Fire. Wish it didn't take cash to play. The game breeds to give more cards for free.
B000J103X4|5.0|Classic ass Album.  The Game is one of my Favorites I'm going to continue to support him. All of his CDs are Classic no doubt.
B00D7JGL36|5.0|This CD is VERY good if you appreciate more traditional country music.  It is clear that Vince Gill is at a point in his career that he is making music that he enjoys.  He does not take the lead vocal role on each track but that is ok as long as you can hear him play guitar.
B00B8WXFWE|5.0|This is their best CD to date. Dont forget to keep listening to the very last track after Survive you is done there is a bonus track that is HOT.
B0063GORYU|4.0|I have always liked Spider, and enjoy playing it on my new Kindle.  Am looking forward to playing more than just the one deck.
B007VUCAVO|5.0|I love it!!  It helps me keep track of the percentage of battery power I have left.  It is a visual reminder which is perfect since I am a visual learner.  Highly recommended!
B00B4Z5J92|4.0|Great movie. A lot of great music recorded at that place, by a lot of great bands. Sound City is a piece of history.
141694737X|5.0|This book is fun and entertaining for small children, and is a subtle way to teach them adjectives.  It was one of my son's favorites when he was little, and remains a hit with my small students.  Like Arnold Lobel, and Raffi, Rod Campbell manages to always hit the right note.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|Beautifully written.  It reminded me of The Housekeeper and The Professor as it related to care givers.<br />It laid out the argument for the disabled to choose how to live their lives.<br />In this case of course how to end it.
B00B99KJR0|5.0|Luv this game, get it almost as good as Atlantis. I never pay for games, I pay for these. So good!
1419705849|5.0|My son loves these books, reads through cover to cover in a day or 2 and the amazon price is a lot better than the local book stores
B00CWY76CC|4.0|This is a pretty fun game. I can not wait until there are more rooms to unlock. It is entertaining.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|Lyrical gorgeous writing but ultimately too many characters and too many threads to follow.  I kept wanting to go back to the characters I became invested in and was frustrated and bored when it didn't happen.  As many here have stated, the ending is oddly flat and uncompelling.  The book just runs of out steam.  That said, he's a wonderful writer.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|I couldn't put the book down. It was so easy to get lost in the book. I watched the movie which inspired me to read the books and I'm glad I did. The author is very good with words and you feel as if you are there in the story. She keeps you guessing through out the book.
B00DRPVE3M|5.0|I love uno it is exactly the same way I played as a kid. It's so enjoyable I can play for hours
B00E8B1P9M|3.0|Not a good movie, the plot is weak and the rock really tries to over act his part to save the whole cast and film
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|This is an example of great TV programming. People that say that TV cannot be culteral are wrong.<br />The writing, acting and costumes are superb
B0029LCJJS|5.0|It's great! I really enjoy the show.  Watch it whenever possible.  But you really have to pay attention to it..
B00CHSPB8Y|5.0|Just finished playing this game. This is a pretty good game I am totally giving to play this every day.
B000OPPBEQ|5.0|I'm reviewing this based solely on the packaging and films; I have not watched any of the extras. Based on those two things alone, this is a great set.
140006922X|5.0|The author does a great job of showing the context of Jesus' life: the history of Jewish rebels and healers in the decades before and after his life, the Roman occupation, the roles of Herod, the Sanhedrin, scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees and how the New Testament was written in the decades after his death. The viewpoint is that of a neutral historian: as an objective observer of the events, and leaving the question of divinity up to the reader and other authors. I have referred to it several times in discussions, and will keep it a a reference work.
B004J1DBJI|3.0|The engine behind the app itself is great, but the keyboard is very lacking. The keys are puny.  Also the voice to text feature does not seem to work on my Android device.  User interface needs tweaking.
140006922X|4.0|This book will be troublesome for many, as it runs contradictory to the mainline story of Jesus the &#34;Christ&#34; depicted in the traditional gospels and the other books of the accepted new testament, particularly the teachings and acts of the Apostle Paul.  It examines, with a direct nod to the history of the area, the peoples and governments of the time, just what a man like Jesus the &#34;Nazarene&#34; would have been, and how he would have been perceived by both his followers and the powers of the local and Roman governments.  I found it fascinating.  A very good and moving read.  I really appreciate insights offered by the extensive notes that follow the main body of the work.
B00992CF6W|5.0|Downloaded it the other night and my 6 and 7 year old sons can't stop playing it.  Great game and great picture
0385523394|4.0|I volunteer at a men's prison, and found that many aspects of prison life were similar: the social groups, counts, arbitrariness of rules  and other. Kerman does a great job of reflecting the tedium, the humor, and the humanity of her fellow inmates. I highly recommend it.
B00BTLSURE|5.0|I have enjoyed listening to OneRepublic since Dreaming Out Loud and have been impressed with their new style of music. This album is their best in my opinion and I highly recommend it.
B00A0MJA1I|1.0|I sent it back that is how much I liked it. The blue ray was broke and it look like it was sitting in the bottom of a lake for a couple of days.
B006BGZJJ4|5.0|This cable for my Kindle was well-priced and delivered to me quicker than I even expected. I can finally read my Kindle, as I lost my other cord somewhere while on vacation.<br /><br />Thanks for the excellent service, merchandise, and meeting my needs quickly.
B00CT2P6VA|5.0|I like this game it was challenging at times, frustrating but also fun. Nice sense of accomplishment when you solved it in the right amount of moves and even more gratifying when done better than the game wizards who invented it. The ending is rather anticlimactic though. I think there should be some sort of payoff when you complete it and it's perfect. A surprise level or something.
B0073RSVMC|5.0|My husband bought several of these toys for a gift to his nephew. As far as we have heard, at age five, he loves these dinosaurs. The quality is great and the shipping was timely. Overall this seems to have been a good purchase for us to his nephew. We will buy again if given the opportunity.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|A winner from Google.  Simple set up via an Android App or on your Chromebook [or PC with Chrome Browser].  Excellent instructions spanning all of THREE steps. On screen and on phone/Chromebook info takes you from there.  Simple to cast from the Chromebook. Casting from Android limited to Netflix, YouTube, Google Play AT THIS TIME.  Google will bring out more, to be sure.  Beautifully boxed, with an HDMI extender [about 4 inches long], a USB power cord, USB/AC plug.
159413586X|5.0|I am a huge fan, of this series, and really hated to see it end.  However, it's a perfect ending and once you've read it you'll understand.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|I know it might not be for everyone but as far as Sci-fi goes, I thought it was pretty good.  A cool story and way better than I read from the reviews.
B000CEAGH6|5.0|My husband bought this item along with several other like toys. As far as we are aware, his five year-old nephew loved it. It is age appropriate and the shipping was on par. We will buy again if the opportunity arises.
B00ABKGG0C|5.0|All I can say is read this book.  It was a referral by my fellow Goodreads readers and boy am I sure glad I read this book.  It is now one of my all time favorites and it really should be made into a movie.  I will say just get past the first chapter as it's a bit confusing but after that it will suck you in and not let go until the finish.  Do not start this on a work night or you will be calling in sick or going in very very tired.
B00466HM28|4.0|Pros: Super light, works with logic, does what it says<br />Cons: akai software is absolutely stupid, knobs dont work with logic, it glitches from time to time (with logic)
B0078X2LKY|5.0|Great book! I remember it from when I was a child & I loved it as well! Can't go wrong with Grover!
1878424319|5.0|Wonderful book with great insights.  It's a nice size to tuck in your purse or bedside table for daily review.
B0011TNVLY|5.0|Great movie - I really liked the movie and it will be great to show the children at the Church Christmas Party.
B0063M22QO|3.0|Not terribly challenging, but a decent buy for a buck. Good for killing time, easy to play, not a bad deal.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I REALLY like the app. It was soooo much fun and has easier controls than I thought. I only wish I could change my skin but I dont know how. Besides that it's a wonderful game!
0446615625|4.0|Just starting to read The Camel Club series which it appears does not have the best ratings.  I understand why with this one anyway.  The first half of the book was rather tedious.  It left me feeling lost in a huge mansion full of rooms covered with very very busy wallpaper.  Phew, what a chore, but it was the intro after all.  Just too much detail.  However the last half did pick up and kept me reading where we learn a lot about the backgrounds of the members of the club as the result of the story.  And I understand one character was just trying to make a point and I can accept that in fiction (or was it?).  I'll continue with the series as I have time, but may skip the lowest rated ones.  Just hate to miss anything that happens we should know about in the future as I'm not sure each book is a must read in the series after one book.  We shall see.  So far his books have been very good and enjoyable mysteries.
B002CMQS1O|5.0|I hadn't watched this in decades- funny as hell!  Total parody of Rock and Roll :)  A must see A+
B009UX2YAC|5.0|My grandkids love this game so much that they had to show me how to play so we could play together.
B00AKEMHCA|4.0|My brother was playing it on the computer and I asked can I play he yeah so I did I loved it so I looked it up on my kindle and it was there I got it IT WAS BEAUTIFUL
B007VUCAVO|5.0|This really is a helpful app that I refer to often. The interface is easy to use and pleasing to the eye.  I recommend this utility app very highly.
B00DW39B2K|3.0|Enjoy both Travolta and De Niro tremendously. However the roles here did not fit them.<br />Travolta is a former Serbian death squad member who has a bone to pick with De Niro,  Seems De Niro was a US Army colonel who fought 10 years prior in the Kosovo campaign and he crossed paths with Travolta. The subsequent flashback scenes that set up the premise seem off the mark as both men look way too old to have participated in the Kosovo action. FYI, De Niro is 70 years old and no amount of makeup or fuzzy lighting makes him appear realistic playing a 37 - 40 year old in the flashbacks.<br />Plot line is straightforward and most readers will guess the outcome an hour before the movie ends.  Found my mind wandering ... was De Niro's cabin available for short term vacation rental?  Didn't it look a little cluttered? What moron director thought a man could run at near full speed shortly after an arrow went completely through the femur bone?<br />Travolta actually was by far the more impressive here; he's a tremendously under-appreciated talent.
B00AIUUXHC|4.0|This is a fun game, albeit a little gory maybe for young kids.  Graphics are good and the game is pretty responsive.
140006922X|5.0|Aslan is gifted in making history come alive and here, the forces at work within the Jewish community and put on it from outside show the struggles and challenges that faced Jesus the man and then the nascent Christian community. The overall effort at placing Jesus' life in context of the crumbling hierarchies in Judea at the time can help readers understand the disciples reported uncertainties. Knowing the perils affecting the Jews at the time, would we be like Judas and be a traitor, or like Peter and deny Christ, or like Thomas and doubt, or would we have the courage and steadfastness of Mary Magdalene? Would we even stop to listen and much less recognize the powerful teachings that Jesus was giving to people? In being transported to the era, the choices were clearly life threatening. Understanding the context of that era increases appreciation for the unfoldment of Christianity.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|This game is a great way to play Bingo!  Many different ways to play and easy! Like to play when I don't want to think to much...be kinda xtra lazy : )
B00CWY76CC|4.0|I enjoyed this app. Hurry and add more levels! I am now hooked but may soon forget I like the game.
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This movie is very slow. It is ok but not my favorite move. I like the actors and actresses but it was very slow. I am glad i didn't see this in theaters. But the 1.32 from red box was worth the price. I glad i saw it but i will not see it again
B00DYOOGYK|4.0|I love this game, when I say that, I play it whenever I'm bored of playing normal console games. I think this game would be as close to console games. The problem is, is that the Kindle Fire HD version is outdated. As in they had updates and items that are hidden in the game but they haven't released them yet. If you look at other mobile devices, they are far ahead than the Kindle Fire. I also hate the fact that the campaign was so short. I mean, I love all types of stories, no matter what. But this story disappointed me. Just as I began to know and get used to the characters, and be in love with them (Metaphorically). (&quot;Spoilers&quot;) Sorry about this part, but they would just end up killing a character just to try to get a close to the game. Even past that, I like the game. I just hope that they update the Kindle Fire HD version or add more story missions somehow. I also hope they read the reviews and find this one.<br /><br />4.9/5
6304936362|5.0|When released the Blu-Ray of this wonderful movie? This dvd has more than 15 years and the quality is not great...
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Started reading one tie and put it down after 30 pages.  Six months later I started reading it again and could not put it down.  One of my top 10 favorite books.
B00ESLTNR8|5.0|I am 10 and I love classics.<br />This book is the best!<br />I am the person who is Beth in the movie so I know all about it!!
B007NVI1LY|3.0|Movie is much too dragged out and includes unnecessary parts that just make it too long. Graphic with sexual scenes and abortion scene. Other than that I love the way it shows his spirit disoriented through his travel in the after life. It changed my view on how I feel about death and makes me curious on life and  reincarnation. I thought it was a good movie overall other than the graphic/disturbing parts.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Totally addictive! Funnier and more satisfying than temple run and great even if you are not a fan of despicable me.
1616614609|5.0|First off, just know that there is a fairly steep learning curve inherent in this game. This should not dissuade you, however, as I am of the belief that depth of this nature can add substantial longevity to a game. The element that really stands out with this game is the flexibility you have in planning your strategy. No two games are ever the same. Once you get the mechanics down, things really begin to open up and the fun factor increases dramatically. The back and forth between the corp and runner(hacker) promotes a mental battle, and the cards played adhere to the thematic concept. Dig into the game and you will be hooked, just don't get scared off if you struggle with the mechanics early on. This game is definitely worth your time.
0141345659|5.0|I have not read this book yet but I am really looking forward to and and also the upcoming movie
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Not being a fan of the original Self Portrait, but loving the all the previous \\"Bootleg Series\\" releases I was very torn about buying this.  Buy it I did, and what a surprise, I loved it, from the first listen.  It'll definitely be in high rotation for the next few months.  Highly recommended to any serious Dylan fan.
B00DPY95D6|5.0|I didn't really know what to expect with Cult of Mirrors, but I was pleasantly surprised by what seemed like yet another courtroom drama, but turned out to be a great book with plenty of character and oomph. Cult of Mirrors has a lot of detail, so it's easy to put yourself into the shoes of the main character. I can almost understand why people would find that a bit droning, but I personally love when a writer can take the time to really develop a character and what their lives are like. I actually loved the courtroom scenes. I definitely recommend this title for those that like thrillers and courtroom dramas.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|This game is really fun I beat all the monkeys I love this game<br /><br />This game is really cool<br />The first time I beat up the monkeys
B00B7Y0206|5.0|I was glad to find the App,so I could watch video's and listen to music! Glad it's available for Kindle!
B00BVYLBP2|5.0|Tatiana Maslany is excellent as Sarah/Alison/Beth/Helena/Cassima. Dr. Leekey should be named Dr. Creepy. And Proclone looks to be really evil. I can't wait for Season 2!
B004X6PRO6|5.0|The Orphan Master's Son is one of those books written so well that it is a pleasure to read--by that I mean the words, grammar and writing themselves.  The story is riveting.  The backdrop requires one to give serious thought to history and cultural differences outside of our own country.  Certainly deserving of the Pulitzer.
B007FJFDXS|5.0|I love this game I have beaten it and it's so fun that I always play the levels again<br />I think this game is amazing and i give it a five stars
0316286850|5.0|There is nothing in this book that I didn't like. It is exactly what i was looking for. I have been wanting to get more into make-up and this is the perfect tool for me to use.
B00992CF6W|4.0|Hi mojang, I want to say this is a really great game. It's fun and extremely addicting. For anyone who is new to minecraft, this is a great choice. I was playing on my survival world, and everything was going fine until the recent update. That's when it started to get blotchy, and when I tried to play it today, I heard a sizzling noise and all my chests were turned black. I don't mod, or hack, or do anything like that, and my tablet is virus free. I'm not sure what it is, does anyone else have this problem? If so do you know how to solve it?
0767821629|1.0|Besides enjoying seeing Craig Bierko this movie was incredibly weird. It made absolutely no sense.  Not really my type of movie
140006922X|5.0|I can't stop talking about this book. So many questions answered. Since I can't find anyone one else here that has read it, I will read it again.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a must read for sci fi fans. The author does a fantastic job at delivering a story line following how a child can be bullied and overcome it, albeit that isn't the point of the story but on top of the interesting nature of the story following a brilliant kid forced into combat training it goes together great! Do yourself a favor and enjoy this one!
B00957T6X6|3.0|My husvband is the one reading this and his taste  leans more toward war history that acutally has happened and not the fanciful.
B0010T3UUM|1.0|The size was right, but the comfort level was horrible. After each use the next day i couldn't get out of bed, the pain went up to my Achilles, that's when I decided to purchase the Keen Utility shoes. I am a chef 6'3, 240 lbs, with Plantar fasciitis and I work 10-15 hour shifts, the Keen made my shifts easier. The Keen's are pricey but worth it, I would stay away from the crocs.
1878424319|5.0|You must read it more than once. Taking notes is a must. Excellent book for a present to your adult children, close friends or family that you get along with, of course.
B007TNS6JI|4.0|it is really nice to play. cool game. well made. you should play. it's free. kill demons n stuff. fun to play
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|This is the same garbage, just in new packaging.<br /><br />I refuse to buy any more Star Wars releases until we are given the ORIGINAL theatrical versions of these movies in Blu-Ray format, restored to how they looked when they came out in 1977, 1980 and 1983.
B003M6OW4Y|5.0|I had never even heard of Dollhouse until my sister told me to watch it. And I am so glad she did! Just like the first season, season 2 of Dollhouse did not disappoint. Throughout the series, I've laughed, cried, and been really mad at characters. They each have their own personality and the development within them is HUMAN! You don't find that very often anymore in books, let alone TV shows.
B008AK8FHM|4.0|This is a very good and interesting book written by Neurosurgeon!  It kept my attention throughout the entire reading, so it was quickly read.
377571622X|5.0|I have loved Crewdson's photos ever since I first saw prints from his &#34;Beneath the Roses&#34; book. Studying one of his photos is like writing a novel in your mind.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|great series was able to catch up from the beginning-- hope they keep making them--- sort of like la law
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Now I'm already a pretty emotional person, but its been a long time since a book actually made me cry THIS much. I though TFiOS was terrific. I enjoyed the intelligence and wit from the two teens, yet how they were still portrayed as teens. Certain mannerisms or word used still kept them real. The parallels between the main character, Hazel Grace, and her favorite book were present and heartbreaking. I enjoyed how real this was, the ending was bittersweet. Not happy sunshine and rainbows. But bittersweet is how life is.
B00AHQNHSY|5.0|This is prefect for watching movies on kindle. Not only is the player great, but it supports just about any type of video file you may need. Plus, you can watch files on a small screen while using other apps. Great tool!
B000TEVKJC|5.0|I love this record , I have it on vinyl but not digital , I do now. If you&#34;re a Grand Funk fan it's a must have.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This book was awesome!  I loved it!  The characters are so very real.  I felt like I knew them. I'm sorry that it is over:)
0823003590|4.0|He should omit the Chapter 5 I think it was about drawing mixed portraits of people and animals<br />Too Gross!  Make me sick to see it.<br />The rest of the instruction is extremely good.
B007US9NA8|5.0|Arnold's encyclopedia has the most knowledge you can get without hiring someone. Take it from the champ! The books has everything you need from workouts, diet plans, routines, history, etc. It keeps you motivated and I always learn something new every time I read from it. I downloaded it on my Kindle and I take it to the gym with me all the time. This is a must have for anyone who loves lifting, going to the gym, losing weight, or who just wants to be healthy or stay in shape.
B00AALHW6Y|5.0|I have had this cd TRUE BELIEVERS for about 2 months now and I must tell you<br />it is soooo good. I think Darius Rucker is an awesome singer.
B00CRWJ5GO|1.0|I am definitely a movie lover, and I'm a big fan of Tom Hanks. But I have no clue what this movie was even about, and I couldn't get past about 30 minutes of it. There's no good explanation about the story line, and it's just really confusing.
B009NY43NY|2.0|This last book in the sookie stackhouse series has very little plot, not much depth and is basically the worst book I've ever bought for $12.
B00AHHODH2|4.0|I almost stopped reading this book, because it got bogged down in unnecessary detail in telling the background/activities of some of the characters.  But I stayed with it, and the plot twists were terrific.  The identity of the professional killer was obvious early on, but the various people all trying to take out a contract to have someone killed was ingenious.  I won't give away the really big twist at the end, but it was super.
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|its nice but needs more features. specifically being able to cast pictures from the phone or mirror the phone display.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|If you are planning on self-publishing on Amazon, don't do it without this book. It clearly explains the how's and the don'ts. Easy to follow and not so long that it will put you to sleep. A must have!
B00CW7KK9K|3.0|I was very excited when you buy the Pulse, but I really expected much better in term of quality and performance .. The works, but I'm sure you could do better ...
B00081U7HC|5.0|I've always loved this movie so when I found it on amazon for sale, I scooped it right up. This film never lets me down!
B0070ZLZ1G|4.0|I got this book as a gift. I thought this was another self-help type of a book and that it was going to help me with my kids. In fact i had hoped that it would give me some ideas on helping them with building non cognitive skills. Although the book did give me some of that, what i learned from this book is well beyond: why the socio economic barriers in our country are getting higher and stronger, what could possibly be done and that there may be hope...
B007HJ9LXE|5.0|What an excellent movie, I see it over and over......Great job Selma!  I used to owned it but I lend it to a Friend and she kept it.  Anyone who will get to see it is going to love it!
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is the best free game in the world. For people who like this I recommend jetpack joyride. That game is free too
B006MW3V6U|5.0|At night I turn on my Fire and watch the episodes over and over.  Can't wait til the new season starts
B007FH9GA6|5.0|Can not stop watching this movie.  Even in some instances change the theme but like how everything comes link to the Oder scenes.
B00E5Q1LTY|4.0|Following on the success of the Star Trek prequel, Star Trek Into Darkness is an action packed movie that is thoroughly enjoyable.  I liked that there is some decent character development of Kirk, McCoy, Scotty, Uhuru, and Spock with occasional overacting by some of the other characters notably Khan and Admiral Wallace.  Still an enjoyable way to spend the evening
140006922X|5.0|As a Christian reading this book, I reminded myself constantly that the writer was writing about a Jewish person, and the expectations of the Jewish people.  It gave me a very different perspective.  I think it should be required reading for
B004DLPXAO|5.0|I have enjoyed using this product. It is very easy to use and I can access a vast amount of books.
B008CX2A2I|1.0|Did not work with my 2013 HTS5500 HTIB Receiver. Given how easy it is to create drivers I am upset by Onkyo's decision to not allow their mid-tier systems to have Bluetooth capability. This is a losing business strategy in the long run.<br /><br />The seller and amazon were awesome: great shipping and awesome fuss-less return policy.
157421327X|3.0|It's a nice little starter book. The examples are elemental enough for any beginner. Certainly inspires one to investigate<br />the technique further.
B00CPTUNBK|3.0|It s good for the kids , not worth what paid for the movie. Not suggest to buy,  can watch
B000VK99Z6|5.0|Simon Pegg is superb. Alternating between tight a--ed cop demoted to the country side from lawless London, he makes friends, suffers their abuse, loosens up, and finally breaks open the biggest case of his career unexpectedly. It has the usual tight British repartee and humor, together with just enough sight gags. Try it, you'll like it!
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was a little slower than the others but still a great read. I can't believe it's not over so now I have to wait again to see where Eva and Gideon will go next. Still plenty of steamy sex and plenty of drama.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Like other reviewers I found the game challenging enough to be fun, but not difficult enough to be frustrating. It's a fun game. Wish there were more levels.
B0066WJLU6|5.0|It has a really bright beam and its a wonderful product, use it whenever I need an instant flashlight, when I am out shopping or looking for my cat..
B002MQYOFW|4.0|Really weird idea, geared toward an audience a little younger than me (50-60's) but I am a sucker for this genre. Movie was pretty good too!
B0099Y2YL6|5.0|The quality was great & I really loved watching Season 3 of Downton Abbey, now I'm ready for Season 4
B00BH0VSM6|4.0|Great way to see how Harry began.  Unique characters and a great way to describe Australia.  Harry is awesome and gets better in every book
B000SCHC0Q|5.0|Heartfelt and touching. This book entertains while also leaving you with a sense of how little we really understand about the impact of war. This story will forever haunt me.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|Loved it!!!! It is one of the best reads in a long time. It has great action that keeps you on the edge of your seat the whole time. I couldn't put the book down.
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|I love the walking dead books.. I watch the show and have now read the books they are similar in ways and very different in others but I love being able to read and see what goes on differently in the show.
B00821OX98|4.0|The first few episodes are a little slow, but it picks up momentum around episodes 4-5 and is very well done.
B008OOYALE|5.0|Great game I really enjoyed it is lots of fun and my brother likes to play it a lot too
B00CDT41RY|5.0|Following the tradition of all Tarantino Films, Django is an outstanding movie, with great casting and superb visuals.  Without any spoilers, Jamie Foxx and Leonardo DiCaprio are excellent in this movie.  The plot line has certain twists and funny scenes which helps release tension from certain moments during the film.  I especially love the relationship between the German doctor and Django.  The treatment of the brutality of slavery was done in a tasteful way, without going overboard.  I watched it twice, because you really can't appreciate the details of the movie with just one viewing.  Also, if you're a Tarantino fan, this movie ranks (IMHO) right by the Kill Bill movies.  A great movie for mature audiences.
B00EPL4PBK|5.0|Ever since the album leaked around the 20th I have been listening to the album over and over again.  And when I bought the album 3 minutes after it's release I have been addicted just listening to the album over and over again you cannot get tired of it
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|An excellent read filled with suspense, twists and turns, and ends with a bunch of \\"what-ifs?\\"  Highly recommended. Happy reading!
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|Quite fun very very addictive not very complicated simple to solve yet changing a must have app slight glitches but nothing major that ruins gameplay
B003LQ3YXU|5.0|What can you say about the Doctor and Rose?  They are GREAT!  This season introduces you to all the bad guys and 2 Doctors.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|Wellllll sometimes I don't get alley spaces or the hint put the letter in the wrong place but oh well
B003UESJH4|5.0|I had this on my DVR but it crashed so I lost it.  I watch it every time it is on TV but one of these days it will be with commercials & probably cut some so I bought it to watch in its true form.
B005K17RU0|5.0|I have only used it a short time. But it is helpful, especially when thunderstorms were forecast. I was able to see where the storm was located.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|It's been a few decades since I read the Ender series.  And I am glad I'm rereading them again now.  It's amazing how good these are second  time around!
B0064X7FVE|1.0|The last update was terrible!! Why did you wreck a good thing? I want the old version back soon or I'm dumping this crappy app!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It tends to take me long to read books. I get easily distracted. This book kept my attention and I couldn't wait to get back to it.
B0063M22QO|4.0|I enjoy the game and being challenged and having the chance to complete the game with the shuffle part of the game
0374264260|5.0|I love this book, A troubled man that sometimes had more sense than others around him. He is loved by many people.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I live in the UK so was expecting a lengthy wait for this to arrive, so I was pleasantly surprised when this beauty turned up on the 31st of August, only 4 days after release, very impressed Amazon.com.<br />The pleasure soon turned to pain though when I tried to remove the tiny screw to insert the batteries, almost immediately the head stripped. For all those that are experiencing the same issue, stay calm and don't butcher it in a ham fisted, heavy handed rage, simply take a flat head screwdriver and gently manoeuvre it to create a new slot that will allow you to remove the screw, then when you fasten it back up only do it so far as to make it sit flush with the base. British ingenuity 1-0 Chinese incompetence.<br />The product itself is exactly what I expected and exactly as described, yes it may be plastic but the overall finish is of a high standard with the exception of the screw, what else would you expect? Wood, glass and metal? Not for that price. The attention to detail of each of the heads is very satisfying, particularly Michone's companions, who are perfect replicas, much like the Zombie head for the Season 2 collectors edition. The whole thing looks fantastic when it is switched on, it really is worth both the money and also the perseverance with that pesky screw!<br />The Blu-Ray set itself is very well presented, great artwork all round, also a nice catalogue filled with more walking dead eye candy to further reduce my bank balance. As for the content of the disks, if you're reading this then you already know how brilliant the episodes are, just add some special features to the mix and your family won't see you for days.<br />The set looks great next to my season 2 zombie head and I highly recommend investing in this top notch purchase.<br />100% satisfied.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|This was a great book. I actually felt the moment that the character was feeling. It was perfect. I love this book.
B00E9PMMPI|5.0|The original version of this film included a text slate that discussed scientific discoveries and how we would \\"someday\\" go to the moon.<br /><br />This slide was deleted for the DVD release, but it is a valid artifact of the time the film was originally released and I hope they restore it to this Blu-ray presentation.
B009D5VNLS|5.0|Such a funny and cute movie!!! Totally worth downloading! It's as good as How to Train Your Dragon! Will watch it many more times! :)
B001VTTRC6|5.0|I cannot understand how anyone could rate this movie as a one star. Maybe not enough special effects or alien visitations for some. What it does have is amazingly good performances by Sean Penn and Tim Robbins as the two leading characters. It has very good performances from Kevin Bacon, Marcia Gay Harden, and Laura Linney.  The Dennis Lehane story is well adapted to the screen and Clint Eastwood does a fine job of building suspense to the heart rending ending. Even if you have read the book (as I had) you have to see the fine acting of the lead characters. Outstanding!
B00AFROVQC|5.0|This book seems like something I would enjoy and I was SO not disappointed. I actually couldn't put it down and am writing this review between books #4 and #5. The only down side I saw was that they need far to soon and I seem to be reading them far to fast. Alas, this is what is to become of a bookstore, when they become enraptured with a new and EXCITING tale. Enjoy the book! As an adult I still enjoy stories of hero's, kings and lands imaginatively conceived. :)
B001U3Y5XE|5.0|This was the perfect gift for my 8-year-old grandson who, like other young kids,  thinks Legos are the best gift possible.
B00A44HRG2|4.0|It's alright...doesn't work that well though. I've used it twice. Google earth is better I think k. Not really worth the time
B005LAIH2M|5.0|I thought that this movie was pretty wicked. I think they did a good twist to the classic story. I thought that Jeremy and gemma did a great job as hansel and gretle. and I thought that the lady who played the main witch was also good. the story is kind of liner but that's ok if you want just a good action/horror film than this is it. this movie did have some funny parts in. one thing I did like about it that they did not make hansel and gretle to much of badass and they got their buts kicked it was realistically. and I also liked how they made them sort of like superheroes that was cool. but all in all this is a good movie you will be entertained and the special effects and makeup art was excellent. if you have not seen this movie then I recommend you do
B003G4W49C|5.0|I was in a hurry to read Ender's Game before the movie came to the big screen in the autumn of 2013. Now that I finished the book, I am certain that a movie, however well made, cannot relay the story, because such a big part of it happens in the head of the protagonist.<br /><br />The book is beautifully written and easy to read; besides having an interesting plot, it teaches a lot about interpersonal relationship in a hierarchical structure. A manager in a company will learn a lot about leading and managing people by reading about Ender Wiggin's experience in the military academy.<br /><br />For every fan of sci-fi, there are a certain number of classical novels and short stories that he or she must read. Ender's Game is now in my own list, sitting next to Joe Haldeman's The Forever War. Have you liked either one of these books, you will undoubtedly like the other just as well.<br /><br />I read somewhere that Ender's Game is on the suggested read list of various military organizations, and now I understand why. That makes two groups of people (besides sci-fi fans of course) who will benefit from reading this book: army commanders and anybody who has to manage people in an organization and wants to become a better leader.<br /><br />I hope readers will enjoy Ender's Game as much as I did. Highly recommended,
B004XDYJRU|5.0|I'm using this on my Fire 8.9 and have been very pleased with its performance. The user interface is very simple to navigate regardless if I'm browsing at random or know a specific station or podcast I want to listen to. Overall speed of performance is also very good on the Fire. I've been using it for a couple of weeks and it has yet to hang up or require a restart.<br /><br />I purchased this to use up my Amazon coins, and am very glad I did. It's far more capable than the free version of TuneIn I have, and I've discovered several great radio stations while browsing about. Well worth the price charged.<br /><br />Highly recommend!
B005UDD1R6|5.0|Neat if I could figure out how to actually use it! I'm not tech-savy so  I have no clue. But great idea anyway
B00C7O8MJ8|5.0|When I got it in the mail it was not Damaged.<br />I would recommend this to anyone.<br />I like it.
B001AITH50|5.0|Always love this movie. Very good. They don't make good movies like this anymore. Wish they had done a better job with the other Anne Rice books to film transfers.
B001O37WTY|5.0|this is a film that defies description - it is so clever and sly and witty and whimsical and weird...  I hadn't seen it since it came out and we are introducing our older teen son to great movies that are new to him.  He loved it too.  It hasn't dated at all, it's as sharp and relevant and funny today was it was when it was made.  Also delightful to see the very attractive John Cusack and Cameron Diaz make themselves so plain for these characters.  And I just love John Malkovich even more.  Has some really funny cameos - Charlie Sheen and the tiniest glimpse of Brad Pitt - wonderful! Every detail is just works.  It's a wonderful film,  a true classic.  Makes me happy that such a quirky, thought provoking odd film exists...
B000QRIGJY|4.0|Engaging plot for readers who like mystery with a touch of intrigue. The characters were familiar and I thought I was reading about old friends
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Practical exercises to teach something that, on the outside, looks very impractical.<br />Changing you entire world by the process of proper thinking.<br />You have energy in your mind, body, and soul - here is how to learn to make it work for you.<br />In the first few exercises I managed to &#34;create&#34; situations in which I received well over $300.<br />It works!
B009AY04A8|4.0|Just like the different cakes and cupcakes you get from an easy bake oven, not great, but edible, and they basically all taste the same.  This is your basic cookie cutter H.O. game that you get from Nevosoft.  Always enjoyable but very predictable. If you like hidden object games, then you will like this one
B00AYB0TOW|5.0|This directors interpretation was far superior.  This is not a remake, this is another chapter of the Dredd chronicle.  As well as having a far superior plot and acting pool!!
B0064X7FVE|5.0|I love this app it lets me know the forecast so I can prepare my children for the week ,great app totally recommend it !
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I like the graphics and convenience of information<br />I like the information how concise and easy to read I like it
B004KA9VGA|5.0|I loved this book for its different slant on witches and vampires etc. wonderful character development, lots of surprises and story lines. What a brilliant series, bring on the rest. I am hooked.
B00EOO55GW|2.0|AM I the only one have a hard time trying to like this album ? they took \\"years of writing\\" to make this? Come on...what little lyrics there all are just dumb,lame whatever you want to call it. Most of the songs are for lack of a better word \\"boring\\" aka overly drug out and could have been cut 45-70 seconds off of each to add a little less dullness to them or at least speed up the pace. What happened to the good old days when they were coming out with stuff with a little more energy in it like Scream, Afterlife, Bat country, Nightmare etc.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|You should get this I really enjoy this and its not to easy or not to hard its just right.
B0041D843M|1.0|I read the entire book. Patiently. I do believe in proteins, vitamins and supplementation of foods. Clearly gym is good. As the book recommends, but demonizing Selenium, Carotenes, CLA,  vitamins, is not right. Above all, we ain't chinese.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|Great game for kids which is fun to play. Teaches y o u how to look after a horse. Love it.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|So far this promises to be an entertaining game.  I took one star off because it asked for a review within the first few minutes.  Definitely a pet peeve of mine.
B004SBQGHS|1.0|Today, 8/30/2013, Amazon is giving away Angry Birds(Ad-Free) away for free. For Ad-free and free, it was a sure download. Once loaded up however, I noticed that I was getting pop-ups alot, including the ones that slide down from the sides and top out of no where. This game is riddled with ads and is definitely not Ad-Free. What a load of crap.
B0054R6BFM|5.0|This book made me think of everything I didn't pay attention to threw out high school. No one committed suicide when I.was in school but how many were close? How many ppl have thought the sAme as Hannah has? Too many!! I'm going to make my 12 yr old brother read this book. And my children when they r old enough.
1582701903|4.0|This is wonderful view that will certainly help you succeed . Is a great daily coaching tool to continue  enhancing your mind
B0044WSF5M|5.0|This movie takes you back 60 years when teenagers were having more innocent? fun than what lot of the kids now have.
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|Kind of like The Matrix and Deep Impact but still a good story and CGI.<br /><br />Overall, good movie and story.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is really fun to play. The graphics are pretty good, and I like the variety of horses you can buy. Its a good way to pass the time.
B00005RDRO|4.0|Lots of great actors in this fun comedy murde mystery.  Always like watching it for great acting and comedy. Buy
B000GGSMB2|5.0|...geat acting....outanding story  Al Pacino is great.  the whole cast is great!  It is a Cubano gangster movie fot those who have never viewed it.  Money, power and political corruption.
B005544TRQ|5.0|We were surprised to be hooked after watching the first episode! Loved watching episode after episode. Now can't wait to watch each episode as it airs!
0316067938|3.0|OK, I only gave this book three stars because I was an English major in collage and studied great literature. So I'm always a little embarrassed to admit that I read the whole series and really enjoyed it. I mean, really, no one reads all the way through the series unless they're having a good time. So, if you enjoy reading books that combine undying love with vampires and werewolves, read on! I did.
0345803485|5.0|If your curious about the BDSM lifestyle, like living it or just want a good book to read then this one does work out.
B0089EHWQE|4.0|A moving story, more than a summer beach read. I need to write more words. I would prefer to just give the four stars

B001NA6096|3.0|Saw Before Midnight and just fell in love with it, but hadn't seen the two others in the trilogy!  Excited to see the film and learn about the characters as they developed their lifetime love relationship.<br /><br />I must admit, I was a little disappointed up until the last 1/4 of the film  The characters were rich and definitely reminded me of my youth and a life that could still be carefree and spontaneous!<br /><br />I would recommend it for sure, and am looking forward to viewing before sunset. I am anxiously waiting to see what will happen in 6 months.  enjoy

B0089EHWQE|5.0|It´s 4:30 am; I have been reading for a few hours, crying for the last bit of it, wondering at how I have been transported by the words and the people (certainly they ARE people, not characters) in this beautiful novel.  This book saunters slowly into your heart, into your being, and then suddenly the time races quickly away and by the end, you are Louisa, and you are in love.  I don't care for long reviews, and especially in this case, it would be unnecessary.  READ THIS BOOK. That's the bottom line.
B00000G3PA|5.0|very good movie , good conditions of the disk, plays perfectly on blu-ray and dvd so I am happy !:)

B0042X9L6A|5.0|I'm a dedicated amateur using a D600.  I wanted a flash that would operate at high sync speeds for outdoor use.  This will sync up to 1/4000 of a second using fancy technology.  I don't care how it works, only that it does work :)<br /><br />There's lots of detailed reviews on the net.  Read 'em if you need to.  But if you want a good flash and not have the weight and bulk and extra expense of the SB900, this one will suit you fine.

B004H4XI5O|5.0|I caught part of Josh Foer's TED talk on memory, and looked up his book. It's quite a good read. It touches on several issues surrounding what we know and don't know about memory. As others have likely mentioned, it is not specifically a self-help book on how to improve your memory. Mr. Foer has a pleasant, first person narrative writing style. If you are not sure about getting this book, look up his TED talk online.
B008K6HN8I|3.0|First let me say I absolutely love this app. I highly recommend to anyone that wants/needs to explore their files to use this. I've tried a few other apps and they just weren't as good as this one. Because of this I really want to give it five stars.<br /><br />So why am I giving this three stars you ask? When I opened the app I got a warning about the copy I'm using and that I have to download it from their site. So I uninstalled and downloaded from their site and it works fine. Not sure if they stopped making it available on Amazon or what the issue is.<br /><br />Highly recommended, but I had to give it a lower rating for that issue.

B000BKHL1K|3.0|Don't be fooled by the many reviewers who misleadingly claim that this product is easy to install.  If you are a generally quite handy person, you may have no difficulty.  But precision is required, given that this is a product designed to hold a lot of quite valuable weight on drywall.  After a fair amount of effort, I was able to install mine (making sure to drill into studs), though it doesn't feel quite as secure as I'd like to put my mind at ease.  The basic mechanics involved seem just a bit off, as there are no hooks--just screws and stainless steel cylinders that support the full weight of 8 bottles of wine.  The finished product looks nice on the wall, though if you have children or pets, take great care to make sure that they go nowhere near the wine rack.
B004U8VX2M|1.0|I found it antiquated and dull. Strange, because I love Antiques Roadshow. Maybe it was the old fashioned Brit accents.

B00CW665VI|5.0|Emma Chase, your debut novel had me from the first chapter!<br />Reading from Drew's point of view was fresh, honest, steamy, hilarious, addictive.......I need more adjectives! This was so different from other adult romance stories. I honestly felt like I was watching this happen as he told the story.<br />Drew had his life in order, and was pretty content with it. Super successful, world and women at his feet, until Kate comes along. She's beautiful, smart, competitive, and engaged.<br />I've never had a book be so thigh-clinching (think about it) and equally hilarious all in one. Seriously, the &#34;look mom, no hands&#34; line somewhere around 50% caught me off guard I laughed so hard I scared my little dog! And, the steamy scenes had my heart rate up I'm hoping I burned some calories.<br />Want an awesome romance story that will knock you off your feet?..... READ. THIS. BOOK!&#34;

B00CSYRHG6|5.0|Fans of Studio Ghibli won't have had much chance to see From Up on Poppy Hill. It enjoyed a brief limited release in theaters a few months ago, but the Blu-ray release on September 3rd will allow many other fans to check it out. I've seen it twice over the past two days and I urge Ghibli fans to buy the Blu-ray.<br /><br />From Up on Poppy Hill looks like a Studio Ghibli film, and packs quite an emotional punch, but don't expect to see the fantasy element present in most of the studio's classics. This is more like Whisper of the Heart than Spirited Away or My Neighbor Totoro. The film is populated by good people doing good things, and there's not a villain in sight. It will appeal to anyone who remembers their childhood, school, young love, and friendship. Like most Ghibli films, it's full of great messages for us and our children.<br /><br />Umi Matsuzaki (Sarah Bolger) is an eleventh-grader, living in 1963 Yokohama; she takes care of her family and a few boarders while her mother is away studying in the US. She cooks and cleans while trying to maintain her good grades, and is a responsible young woman. One day in school, she meets Shun Kazama (Anton Yelchin). He performs a daredevil stunt to try to gain support for his campaign to save a clubhouse used by him and his friends. Umi and Shun form a friendship that is the heart of the film, but the story isn't quite so simple. This is not just a tale of teen romance; it's the story of a group of young people pulling together to achieve a common goal. Some of the twists are unexpected, and considerably more complicated than those found in typical animated fare.<br /><br />One of Umi's habits is to raise flags on the pole on her balcony to signal to ships passing in the harbor. I had better not reveal the reason for that, but it's far from trivial and will help you to empathize with her situation. Umi's world is constantly changing. Her small town has a real community feel, and it's common for people to be friendly and help one another in their daily lives. The bigger picture shows Tokyo preparing for the 1964 Olympics, so there's constant pressure to join modern society and leave behind some of the antiquated life that Umi is used to.<br /><br />One of the high points is seeing how the students work together to renovate their dirty old clubhouse, and the daring way in which Shun, Umi, and a friend attempt to get their message heard by someone who is actually in a position to make a difference.<br /><br />Some of the themes in From Up on Poppy Hill are pretty serious. I know that I have probably failed to capture the interest of many readers, because this is another Studio Ghibli film without significant conflict. Instead of an evil villain, we are shown some of the problems young people might face while growing up. One twist is heartbreaking, and I won't dare reveal it here. However, I will say that by the end of the film, the mood is extremely positive. Like all good dramas, there must be some challenges and heartbreak in order for us to appreciate the good things in life. When the film ended, I was smiling. I wish my world could be as idyllic and charming.<br /><br />I'm sure some of you are wondering about Goro Miyazaki's direction, and whether the future of Studio Ghibli is in good hands with Hayao Miyazaki's (72) retirement announced, and Toshio Suzuki (65) probably approaching the end of his career. Goro Miyazaki received plenty of criticism for Tales of Earthsea (2006), and openly admitted that he played it safe and didn't try to extend himself. From Up on Poppy Hill is a much stronger effort, and I hope it enables him to produce works of similar quality in the future. Hayao Miyazaki wrote the screenplay with Keiko Niwa, and I'm sure that it helps make the film feel familiar, and as warm as other Studio Ghibli entries.<br /><br />Many of the established Ghibli traits are present. I love that the female characters are so strong; something that Pixar could learn from. The importance of family, friendship, and mutual respect is always on display. The young and the old both have a place in the world, and they care about one another. Notice also the scenes involving food. I can remember so many similar scenes from other Ghibli films. Perhaps they are present to remind us how good something as simple as a pleasant meal can be? There's also an umbrella; it's amazing how often they appear in Ghibli's other worlds.<br /><br />Before I close, I must mention the Blu-ray special edition. Unlike most US Ghibli releases, this one is released by GKids and Cinedigm. The picture quality is wonderful, and the audio features both US and Japanese DTS-HD Master Audio 5.0 mixes. I was startled a couple of times by the immersive output from the rear speakers. The package includes a DVD, so you can introduce a new fan to Ghibli, and a rather informative 16-page booklet. Hayao Miyazaki talks about how the project originated, and Goro talks about his work on the film. The special features total more than three hours, and include the film in storyboard form, plus interviews with Goro Miyazaki and Hayao Miyazaki. For those who like to watch the film in the original language, the subtitles are white and unobtrusive.<br /><br />Ghibli fans, or anyone who cares about life, people, and good storytelling, should not miss this release.<br /><br />Overall score 4.5/5portance of family, friendship, and mutual respect is always on display.

0385349947|5.0|When I shared with a female colleague of mine that I was writing a review of Sheryl Sandberg's Lean In:  Women, Work, And the Will to Lead, she asked a pointed question:  would it be difficult for me as a man to review without bias a book about women in the workplace?<br /><br />The question stayed with me as I began reading this book by the COO of Facebook that has been on the NY Times best-seller list for 20 weeks and counting.  What I found was that Sandberg quickly answered the question for me.  While the book is ostensibly about the lack of equality in the workplace, it's really about subconscious biases--by both men and women.<br /><br />While women became 50 % of college graduates in the U.S. in the early 1980s, only 21 of the Fortune 500 CEOs are women.  Women hold 14% of executive officer positions and constitute 18 % of our elected congressional officials.  Pay inequity is striking. In 1970, working women in America were paid 59 cents for every dollar their male counterparts made.  By 2010, that amount had been raised to only 77 cents for every dollar men made.<br /><br />While many Americans may attribute these facts to historical discrimination or a glass ceiling that has now been cracked in most industries, Sandberg argues that this is not the case.  In the past two decades, equity in the workforce has stalled.<br /><br />Sandberg digs for answers to this inequity by using two sets of tools:  professional and personal.  The book is packed with footnoted hard data and referenced studies.  But it is the personal anecdotes recalling Sandberg's own struggles in making choices regarding family and career that make the subject approachable and immediate.  In doing so, Sandberg makes herself vulnerable, and `just like us.'  This is a commendable stance (and ultimately a powerful one) for an individual who is ranked on Fortune's list of 50 Most Powerful Women in Business and TIME's 100 most Influential People in the World.<br /><br />Her personal anecdotes are enlightening.  For example, she shares the story that two years after joining Facebook as COO, she was in New York for a meeting with a private equity firm.  When the meeting broke, she asked the senior partner where the women's restroom was.  He had no idea.  It appeared that she was the only woman ever to have come for a meeting during the man's tenure.<br /><br />The conversations with her husband about sharing child care and other issues are similar to those taking place in most American homes with two working parents of small children.  Sandberg shares her struggles in her career advancement, particularly those related to raising a family.<br /><br />Sandberg presents a comprehensive review of why there is not equity in the workplace.  There are indeed historic gender biases that favor men (for example, Sandberg admits to never having had a female boss).  There are also many ways women limit themselves when making choices about careers.<br /><br />While we like to think that gender bias is part of the past, statistics show otherwise.  A 2012 study found when identical resumes for a manager position were submitted from a male student and a female student; scientists of both sexes gave better marks to the male applicant.  Though the applicants listed the same experience and qualifications, the female was judged less competent and offered a lower starting salary.<br /><br />Sandberg doesn't hesitate to point out that women often hold themselves and other women back.  \\"Often without realizing it, women internalize disparaging cultural attitudes and then echo them back,\\" she says.  \\"Women are not just victims of sexism, they can also be perpetrators.\\"<br /><br />Sandberg calls for women to \\"lean in\\" and to empower themselves and others.  She quotes former secretary of state Madeleine Albright who once said, \\"There's a special place in hell for women who don't help other women.\\"<br /><br />The book does more than highlight an often-overlooked problem and explore itsunderlying causes.  It is also filled with actual solutions and examples of how they have worked.  Businesses and industries are all kinds have become increasingly committed to making a difference in this area.  In addition, women are \\"leaning in\\" more and more to take on new roles.<br /><br />While the book acknowledges that women in the developed world are better off than ever, the goal of equality has not been reached.  To move forward, both men and women, have to understand our biases and agree to work through them.  \\"We are a new generation,\\" the author writes, \\"and we need a new approach.\\"  Sandberg's excellent book is a strong first step.underlying causes.

B000JMKQX0|3.0|I liked this book - and I didn't. I normally read books with a main character or two - a story with a build up and then a climax. Where you can be glad or sad - depending on the outcome. This book was so different - that is why I am unsure if I liked it or not. Lots of interesting facts about the war with the zombies. Just no central character for me to come to know - to root for or to hope he gets caught. No story line to keep my interest building. Still, it's not a bad book.

B000JRYOPG|5.0|This is my second time buying this movie because my first one decided to grow legs - regardless. Delivered pretty quick & was in great condition. :) top shottas for life.
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Great game. Easy to pick up. Easy, fun game to kill time with. I recommend both I s game to anyone that enjoys social games.
B00D9PUXQY|5.0|A victory lap with Coal Chamber behind him; DevilDriver frontman Dez Fafara has once again put to rest his nu-metal persona and gotten back to modern pursuits. \\"Winter Kills\\" finds Fafara and co. returning their gaze to all things groove, delivering a chunky, thick assault on the senses. One--which much like Lamb of God--proves yet again that rhythm can be just crucial as riffs.<br /><br />\\"Winter Kills\\" by no means lacks on shred however. But even with a dual axe attack, the constant tilling performed by the bands rhythm section is what dictates the pace. As such, the battery of scorching leads and chugging riffs alternate with their lowend compatriots for the lead. This unstable mixture enables a fluid instrumental democracy in a genre where guitars are often given free reign.<br /><br />A few ripping solos aside, a tenuously fair balance is struck with the group often working as one. Overtop of this molten ecology is Fafara`s relentless guttural screaming. Although limited in range, he more than capably belches out a stream of sandblasted larynx diatribes.<br /><br />DevilDriver are a band that know their strengths and fortify them. This is a divisive quality, as once they hit their stride, they rarely break it. Groove is king and aggression is law. Even the melodic strains that linger about slower tracks like \\"Curses And Epitaphs\\" aren't enough to stall the momentum in any substantial direction.<br /><br />That DevilDriver choose to work as a unit and routinely stay confined to their chosen medium is their double-edged sword. Aside from an oddball cover of AWOLNATION`s \\"Sail\\" that closes the album; this release stays bent on visceral destruction and bulldozes over everything else. Last but not least, the deluxe edition does give the fans a little more for their money, including 2 bonus tracks, \\"Shudder\\" and \\"Back Down To The Grave\\" along with a bonus concert DVD making Winter Kills a MUST HAVE for Devildriver fans.
B00D2DI342|5.0|The song Get Lucky is amazing!<br />IT gets you in a good mood and feeling! It reminds people of the disco age, the 70s! Theres no possible words to explain how amazing this song is! Daft Punk has improved and came back! The Radio edit VS the album version. I would have to say the album version is better but really the only difference is, is that the radio edit is 3 minutes shorter. The remix is 10 minutes long! All the songs are amazing and this is a must buy! Daft Punk's new album Random Access Memories is also a must buy!
B008JEJNDE|5.0|Can't get my husband to take them off! He loves them! They are his favorite shoes!! Thank you so much
B00DC7N9NS|4.0|Not an excellent movie but good. Good cast and acting, can be slow at times. Not a bad rental on date night.
B003G4W49C|5.0|I read this book from a recommendation and am grateful for it. This was one of those hard to put down and can't wait to start reading it again books. I highly recommended this  great read and just hope they don't ruin th  book with a bad movie.
B008Y2FRFO|3.0|This game is just like the ones in the carny midways - it's almost impossible to 'win'. It's fun, but probabaly better for folks younger than myself (75). The game has good graphics, and coin motion is realistic.
1250029465|5.0|I thought what a inspirational story. I can't say enough about the book!!!  Everyone should read that when people start feeling sorry for themselves.  I love cats and that made it that much more.  So happy for James and Bob.
B004HWYTP4|4.0|Love Bruce Willis, with all the well known people , they all click. Love the movie and watch it all the time.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|As basic calculators go, this is top of the line.  The ads are unobtrusive, the appearance is pleasant, and it is not glitchy.  True, it is not a scientific/graphing calculator, but it is a workable app.
B00DJFIMW6|3.0|My kids like this but it's not something they rave about. Just ok. I tried it as well and it's good they have different levels of difficulty.
B004SOR4H6|4.0|I CAN ACCESS MY ACCOUNT ON THE KINDLE FIRE HD WHICH MAKES IT MORE CONVENIENT TO ACCESS THIS SITE.  I CAN'T GET IT ON MY SMARTPHONE, THOUGH.  I DON'T KNOW WHAT THE PROBLEM IS THERE.
B008UCJ7KO|4.0|This book was really good it actually has a story line behind it!! Can't wait for another one! I like fifty shades of grey but this was a little better!
B009CGCJR0|5.0|Paul Newman plays master con artist Henry Gondorf. His pal in crime is Robert Redford (Johnny Hooker). Together, they avenge the murder of fellow grifter Luther Coleman (Robert Earl Jones). The two devise an elaborate scheme to take Doyle Lonnigan (Robert Shaw) for 1/2 million dollars. The plot keeps audiences guessing right up until the end of the film! This film won the \\"Best Picture\\" award and six other Oscars! Well worth viewing, and extremely entertaining--it should not be missed!
B00DLKXF3A|2.0|I would have thought A7X fans could recognize a dud when they heard it. The overall positive feedback on this album is incredible. I am a huge fan of this band, rating City of Evil as maybe my favorite album of all time of anyone, with Waking the Fallen just a hair behind... I could listen o those albums daily for years and not get tired of them and spotting new aspects of creativity with each listen. But this album... Even if it weren't darivative at ALL, I would still find myself falling asleep to the trite lyrics, riffs and chord progressions. I wanted to skip through songs on my FIRST listen, finding nothing interesting at all in most tracks. This band has gone from Classic to laughable... Kind of like the reviews on this page. I don't want to be That Guy who disses those who simply have a different opinion, but seriously. No wonder there is so much crap out there. If no one holds an artist to a higher standard they can just sit back, relax and crap albums like this out for the rest of their careers and retire fat and happy. I hoped for a lot more from theses guys...
B00COGZ8FU|4.0|This was an exciting movie. The twist and turns were exciting. I rather enjoyed this movie. I missed it the theaters but  glad I was able catch though Amazon's on demand selection.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I love these books even the sad part of them please write more! I love The Hunger Games :\\") -_-
B00DW5IM9Q|2.0|What's next?  A 2 CD set of Dylan's phone messages to Albert Grossman?  Columbia is really scraping the bottom of the barrel with this one.  Dylan has had a lot of very fertile periods, but he's also had some fallow periods.  These recordings fall into the latter category.  He was obviously flailing around in these sessions with no direction home.  There were some good songs on \\"New Morning\\" but the versions here add nothing to the Dylan legacy.  Sometimes what's in the vault should stay in the vault.
B006OE7XM4|5.0|This young man has a great long future in music.  He has a voice that can sing in any music genre placed before him.  Look out for Gregory Porter!
B00425S1H8|5.0|I've tried other serial adapters and this is the only brand I've had 100% success with. Using it with a MacBook Pro running Windows 7. Also used with Asus Vivo running Winfows 8.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|This series is unique, still fun to watch.  I wish they had been able to get financing to continue with more seasons!
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Very nice writing and a truly intriguing plot,what's not to love.  The characters  are well thought out and given real depth.  I found it to be a real page turner!
B003D5X3VM|5.0|Great!  Here is another superstar on the horizon.  I love his voice and the way he interprets a song and lyric.
B0098PX68G|5.0|Deeply moving and emotional, I didn't see the ending coming at all. Really impressed. Once again, Benedict Cumberbatch delivers an outstandingly well acted character. I absolutely love this performance.
B0040HO01Y|5.0|Watching on my IPad.  Great way to follow this series<br />Would recommend Amazon Videos.  Good quality and thy were free with Amazon Prime Membership.
B0064X7FVE|5.0|Great forecasts.  Can change cities FAST!  Good site to check current or future forecasts.  You can view small areas up close to see the weather in your local area.
B008J34466|5.0|Both my wife and daughter just love Pink. This CD has some great songs on it so I had to get it for them.
B00EQ0CKRQ|5.0|Asphalt 8 is way better then number 7 it's just soo amazing you should buy this it's totally worth $1!!!!!!!!
B00C061I1M|5.0|Having seen Valerie June live twice--once with The Wandering and once opening for Ryan Bingham--I really couldn't wait for this album to be released.  It fulfills all of my expectations and then some.<br /><br />Valerie June has a unique style that is hard to explain adequately.  Her influences range from traditional hill country music to Memphis soul to gutbucket blues.  But her voice is her own.  If you're new to her, be sure to check out her contributions--along with everyone else in the group--on the Luther Dickinson-led group The Wandering.  And then when you listen to this album you'll really understand the range of her talent.<br /><br />Workin' Woman Blues is a gem.  Be sure to check out the performance on David Letterman.  The Dan Auerbach produced songs clearly have his imprint, but the songs are all hers.  What I didn't expect was the masterfully performed soul songs.  They stand up to any of the classics.<br /><br />Do yourself a favor and get this album as soon as you can.
B007I2BZIE|5.0|One of the best Rush albums since Moving Pictures and Snake & Arrows! Very rich and full sound with the string ensemble! I loved it!
0062124293|1.0|I did not find this book to be &#34;empowering&#34; at all. Moran rails against a sexist patriarchal culture, but in doing so, proceeds to tell women what they should call their genitals (hint: it starts with a C), how they should trim or not trim their body hair (pubic hair should NOT be waxed), and how they should feel about porn (good). By telling women what to do, you are not progressing past a culture that has historically told women how to live their lives, you are simply telling them they should do something different. Shouldn't true feminism be about allowing women to make their own choices and do what is right for them in a world in which they finally have options? This book was frustrating and not empowering or inspiring as a woman.
B001F4UHGC|2.0|Very slow and dragged out.  Was great in its time. But not by today's standards.  would not recommend to anyone.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I think you should make the world endless and add big forests. Otherwise, it's great! Very detailed and fun to play with friends.
B001LIBRL6|5.0|Woody is at his best as a neurotic personality who overanalyzes everything and stumbles his way through life -truly funny.  And of course, Diane Keaton, is perfect as his counterpart.
B00005AQF7|1.0|Bought this cd and eveything looked right..I put in the disc and it was completely different music..The cd case and cd were right just wrong music on the disc
B000I9UA8U|5.0|I saw The Full Monty went it first came out and many many times thereafter. Its a feel good flick of the first order. The acting is covincing, the characters are engaging- the film continues to put a smile and each time I watch it I notice some perfect little detail in set or dialogue.
B0063M22QO|3.0|I may have downloaded the wrong one or need to investigate this one further, but it is really easy to play, I need a more challenging one.
B00170F0DE|5.0|I remember watching this movie when I was a child. Brought me back to many unforgettable memories. I love this movie!
B009NY43NY|4.0|I did not have high hopes for this book after all the negative reviews.  I did feel like I needed to finish out the series though.  I actually liked it.  It wasn't the all time best written book, but it was fun in the usual Sookie Stackhouse way.
B008B8DY2O|3.0|Some great writing spoilt by self-obsessid nature of the main character and repetitive passages on his views about love and life. The first 3rd of the book is worth a 4-5 star.
B009XIXVU6|4.0|The story kept my interest, but I thought that some of the characters would be more involved with the other characters by the end. Different characters evolve in separate plots, that eventually come together into one story. The beginning of the story delves deep into their lives and characters. By the end I did not feel the same intensity with some of them,like Marcos, or the two brothers. I just wish Hosseini would have pulled them in better at the end.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|I love how this book is set out. It makes you want to keep turing the pages! I got so caught up in this book! I finished it reasonably fast because I didnt ant to put it down! It ios so sad though! I love how there are always two or more perspectives in this book! I recommend this book very highly! THE BEST BOOK I HAVE EVER READ!!
B00DC7N9NS|5.0|A small-time magician is swept away to an enchanted land and is forced into a power struggle between three witches.
B00AGJ4HC2|4.0|It is only a 4 player game but it is easy to learn. There are not too many permutations and most of the people I have played it with now are easily able to figure out who has what card. There is still a small element of luck though. It's a small enough game to bring to a bar.
B003U4UPTE|5.0|So far the show has been great! Has a somewhat complex storyline that both me and my fiancé really enjoy.
B00A285OOW|4.0|Interesting both historically an as a work of fiction. After reading the white queen, which is now on cable, I wanted to continue reading and I had a number of options. I enjoy the heroines of this saga because they have as many faults to their character as admirable traits.
0062014536|5.0|great book i love dystopian books and this is my new fave! finished it very quickly . pick this up
B00026WU7I|4.0|A portrait of humanity. ENJOY! If you like Bob Dylan you will LOVE this!!!! A Must for your Dylan collection!
1608838137|5.0|It was the best show I have ever watched on television in my whole life.  The acting was superb. costumes were great. I can not wait for season 4.
B00163T7OA|5.0|This is probably the most beautiful CD Miss Sarah has done!!  I am definitely a<br />huge fan of her' s and have most of her wonderful music.  Her voice is Crystal<br />clear on this CD.  She really shows her sweet spirit in this one.  She is so God<br />blessed with her talents and is still just a down to earth girl!!!  Some of the<br />songs on this CD , I have never heard her sing anywhere else.  I am absolutely<br />thrilled with this CD.  I am looking forward to having the DVD that goes with<br />this CD.  I love Sarah Brightman's music and her sweet,sweet spirit.This CD<br />Is a must for any fan of our Angel of Music, Miss Sarah Brightman!!  Thank you,<br />Sarah, for sharing your beautiful voice with us!!!!
0765325950|5.0|But I will, soon.<br /><br />Love the series, I'm not gonna review this book, quite a few many have.<br />I just wanted the hardcover version of the finale of a series that gave me great joy reading.<br /><br />Great for the collection.
B00C8USQEM|5.0|I was skeptical after reading reviews about clearly pirated DVDs being sold, but the blu-ray bundle that arrived on my doorstep was 100% legitimate.  The only complaint I had was the laugh track was turned up in this iteration.
B00127RAJY|5.0|There is simply nothing negative to say about this DVD.  There are a lot of dieting/exercise plans that you can invest in (and some that I fell for) that promise quick results (after you spend a pretty penny), but they're not very sustainable.  I love that for under $10 (plus another $15 for some 5lb hand weights) I found something that I enjoy, is sustainable, and inexpensive.  I just finished my 14th day (nonstop) on this DVD.  Prior to this, I was running (something I HATE to do) to try to lose some weight.  I'm 5'1\\" and couldn't bring myself under 150 (I really should be closer to 115 for my height).  I had a gym membership, went to classes, spent money on B12 injections and saw a weight loss doctor (long story short... a hack who insisted that I needed to starve myself).  Money I'll never get back.  It was frustrating to feel like that money, time, and effort were for naught.  There was no change in the scale and no change in my body.<br /><br />Two weeks ago, I bought 30 Day Shred.  I've lost about 4 lbs (I think... the water weight flux is always confusing), but even without a single pound of weight loss considered, I've DRASTICALLY changed the way I look in the mirror.  My once-painfully tight clothing (I refused to shop for more fat clothes, part of my self-motivation), is now loose.  I can wear clothes that were shoved into the back of the closet more than a year ago.  Let me tell you, I'm PANTING during this workout.  I've never had more than a little bit of sweat beading on my face and chest.  I'm dripping sweat by the end of the workout and I usually wait about a half an hour for my body to cool down before showering (otherwise, I'll get out of the shower and still be sweating while I'm getting dressed-- eww.)<br /><br />What I love, is that yes, it's really hard, but it's also only 20 minutes.  By the time your brain and your muscles are telling you they can't handle it anymore, you're on your last set... and you can't let yourself stop when you can see the finish line.  I've really surprised myself and I can honestly say that I'm very proud of my results so far.  I can't wait to see where I'll be in another two weeks.<br /><br />I plan on buying the Ripped in 30 DVD after I finish the 30 Day Shred.  This is going to be my new 'go to' daily workout.  This is part of my routine now.  I allow myself some treats once in a while, but my primary food source comes from leafy greans and lean protein.  I'm saving money by buying less processed foods, and I'm finding that I'm also less tempted by the not-so-healthy options.  It simply doesn't fit with my lifestyle anymore... it's counterproductive to the work I've been doing.
B0017SWPXY|3.0|Auto racing is not my thing, so I did not fully appreciate some descriptions of the sport.  The story is told through a dog's voice. He was a loyal companion to his owner/keeper, but his insight into human relationships was not believable. Also incredible was his expectation to be reincarnated as a human. It held my attention throughout, however.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This is an amazing game I like it a lot its so so so much fun even if your an adult
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This is a good app for a bit of challenge without too much stress.  I am looking forward to more levels.
B0075MFS9Y|5.0|I love the story element in many of their songs. I love the imagery. It's fun, yet relaxing music especially for the road!
B003DCJA94|5.0|Having seen this film when it came out in 1966 when I was a highly impressionable 20 year old, I am undoubtably biased in its favor.<br />I have never forgotten the scenes of David Hemmings wandering through a lush, very green and very empty English park, taking random photographs as an artist, not &#34;just&#34; a fashion photographer. Of course the park isn't really empty; there's a beautiful woman (Vanessa Redgrave) and perhaps a dead body.<br />  Antonioni's film is a must see for film buffs and cultural historians with things to say about the 60's. Yes there was more going on in 1966, but Blowup correctly shows part of the period as some of us let our hair grow long and bought used Nikons.
B005MHI0QM|4.0|I read this when I was younger and I still enjoyed reading it in my 20's. Great book for all ages!
B00992CF6W|5.0|this is the beast better than Pc! it has every thing you can imagine it has butter and diamond and iron
B005UKK4Y2|2.0|Sorry, I only made it through about half the film, when I realized I hadn't laughed or even smiled once ans so shut it off Given the quality cast, I thought it would be funny, but I was just not even a little amused. The &#34;bosses&#34; were indeed horrible, but the &#34;good guys&#34; weren't much better.
B009IRVSVQ|5.0|I bought this CD about a month before I saw Bruno in concert in Houston this summer and it has been on constant repeat since.  I cannot listen to anything else right now.  The songs on this album go far and above the ones on Doo-Wops & Hooligans.  Each one showcases his songwriting talents in a unique way that I never get tired of.  All the songs are amazing and it's hard to pick a favorite but &#34;Gorilla&#34; is up there - extremely sexy lyrics and melody that definitely paint a picture!
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love Bingo Blitz highly recommended. The slots are as fun as the bingo play wish I earned more credits daily but still love it.
B009O07NMA|5.0|I bought this CD for one song only but I find the whole CD is delightful. Once again I do not need to write a review that has a certain number of words.
B000FCKPHG|2.0|I love the ideas presented and plan to use them in my classroom, but I found the same thing being repeated over and over.  I think I would have just as much takeaway if I had stopped after chapter 3.  I would have also liked to have had more tangible things to use in my classroom.
B008K9SG9K|5.0|I bought this for one song but like the whole CD.  Once again they say I have to say a certain number of words, so blah blah blah
140006922X|5.0|Being raised Catholic and attending Catholic schools all my educational years, I found it very fascinating about the life of Christ and how it was written and by whom.  Mr. Asian has done a remarkable job of providing a lot of information that over the years has been, at times, a little &#34;fuzzy&#34; in its interpretation.  I haven't finished the book yet, but am getting close and wish a book like this could've been available while I was attending school.  This book should be mandatory reading for students.
B0052YAKS6|5.0|I only purchased this for one song but the whole CD was good.  That's all I have to say I don't need to say it any the number of words you require.
B003VPWXRO|5.0|Beautiful written book, with a lot of weight, and recovery, love and knowlegde! Love reading this book, Portia deserves it.
B0009P5YXO|5.0|Number 10 was my Doctor and I love having this little replica to remember him. It is plastic, so it is a little flimsy, but I expected that because of the other reviews. The sounds are spot on and the overall look is perfect. I don't recommend for little kids because the pen tips are removable and rather small. Perfect for a grown up waiting for a mad man in a blue box to take them to the stars.
B00A7OIXW6|5.0|This movie was such a great movie, at first I didn't think it was going to be that good, then it even made me cry at the end because you get so caught up in each character.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Really really really good. I sobbed uncontrollably, and I loved it. I wish I had been that witty at 16, or even now.
B0084TWN9K|3.0|This book did not hold my interest and thought process, continuing to find a story  line - I found myself forcing to finish.
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Despicable Me is very funny. Family movie that can be enjoyed with the kids. Parents will enjoy the minions...they remind me if our I<br />3 kids in the back of the car.
B004J4WLB4|5.0|I found this book to be endouring, delightful and well written - the story line keeps your interest, with hopes for a wonderful ending
B009FZHYKU|5.0|Generally, I don't buy video online.  Since i already pay for Netflix I wait for it to come out there.  The Walking Dead is, however, such a fantastic series that I couldn't wait, and payed to see it early.
B004EPZ034|5.0|The grand kids loved it. Grandson ordered it and was very excited when it arrived. they all loved watching it.
B000IZA9NU|2.0|This movie reminds of the days when I would look forward to the new episode of Next Generation only to be disappointed by lackluster writing and cliche.
B00ESY77LO|2.0|The movie started out great with a lot of energy, intrigue and amazing visuals, so it looked like it was going to be as great as the previews.  But they should have made the whole thing 90 minutes instead of 2 1/2 hours long.  It's 2 1/2 hours long and half way through it all bogs down, is slow, and nothing exciting happens.  It was really a let down after the exciting beginning.  We were expecting exciting some plot twists or unexpected surprises, but it literally seemed like they changed directors half way through and let the dull director finish the movie.  I wouldn't recommend this because of the slow and uneventful second half of the movie.
B004XUMMFE|5.0|The best science fiction series of the last decade...  It is a must watch for any serious fan of space opera.
B00DU74U74|4.0|It was pretty much like the book.  It was well done.  But it wasn't really thrilling or exciting, easily forgotten.  It was okay.
B009NX61JY|5.0|Great movie how sometimes looking for a connection friendship love isn't always about being the most beautiful but finding that connection with someone like she said that really knows her
B004U8VWLE|3.0|For more than half an hr, the movie seduces us into believing that one will see some kind of supernatural thriller. Then it morphs into some kind of psych noir, and then ends with a dark poetic metaphor. It plays with the conflicts between unconscious and the conscious, repression and human desire to be free, conflict between our angel and our tormented, chained demon and how our realities can hold the valid and invalid in the same vision. The movie gets three stars for its unique technique of telling a story or a superb concept. Missed one or two more stars for not being a wholesome work. Overall acting was OK, especially the main female character was simply awesome. Honestly, she was the only act worth watching, everyone else was simply supporting scaffold in my book. The story itself, albeit strong in concept, weak in execution. The script could have better connections between scenes. Few other characters could have something more to do for a semaless experience for the audience. The ending is tragic but I don't think it had to be that way. Ultimately,the protagonist had to destroy a part of one's self to give birth to another. Why not carry them both the live them equally? For many in the audience, this movie may ring the tone of some kind of dark self-help message. Overall, worth watching. Vincent Cassel played his part, but it was quite peripheral, not a central part in relation to the whole movie.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great show, every episode is exciting. Can't wait for season four to air! Great characters, set, costume, and story line.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|There is so much bad television these days that a program like Downton Abbey is a welcome change.  Can't say enough about the quality of the acting.  The scenery is breathtaking.  And there is just enough humor to balance out the sadness.  I can't wait for it to start the next season!
B009PHQ9OA|5.0|I love their music. The first time I heard their music it was on The Vampire Diaries. I went looking to buy the song that was featured on that episodes but I couldn't find it. I went to Bastille website and then I found out that this album was coming out! I couldn't wait for it to come out, it felt like forever before it finally did come out! I love it more than I thought I would!
B0049P1ZZQ|5.0|Late to the party in watching this show, but glad I got started.  Disappointing that the season was only six episodes, but that just got me to season 2 quicker.
B005XR3K5M|5.0|These cards are awesome they feature items, equipment, and Characters from some of the best legend of zelda games.  I only wish there were more suits in card decks I would love to see a suit featuring legend of zelda twilight princess (hey I can dream can't I).
B008518MOW|4.0|While this movie didn't come 'out of nowhere' like the first one (anyone can be hero for a day), I found it interesting: consistent with all the Sci-fi-action-comedy of the series so far, and a quite satisfying plot--very pretty in 3D also.
0793563836|5.0|I just started playing again after 10 years and wanted to start from the beginning to hopefully elinate any bad habits.  No regrets going back to basics and glad I am doing so with this book!
B00ECUARO8|3.0|This seemed to be an overly long and ultimately boring movie in too many respects. Coming of age story for 2 young boys is highlight of film. Much of rest is disposable as it did not hold my interest. Witherspoon wasted in her poorly defined role, you just do not care about her. There's a story that's just OK, but it could have been better.
B008YW5RH2|5.0|At first glance I thought that this game would be hard to play. I was wrong. I also thought it would not be hard to beat. Again I was wrong. I enjoy this game.
B001AQO3QA|5.0|Nothing is better than the original.  Seems the producers of Prometheus strayed a little too far from this classic.  But having these in a Blu-ray set it unbelievably great to watch.
1932100660|5.0|Great data.  Crazy good information.  I just happen to be lucky enough to live in an area where the author speaks quite frequently at a health institute.  To me the information is clear and concise.  I love data and real people information - this has it all.
B009VMN3RA|5.0|Did not realize Shirley Mclain was such a be ouch.......glad to see Sachi is doing well on her own, it is amazing how our childhood lives as well as adult lives are so much in common....good book, did not want it to end...
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|This places Jesus in an utterly realistic and plausible political and imperial context.  A must read for everyone who takes Jesus and Christianity seriously.
B00AEFXKOO|4.0|No matter what, there's no denying how great this movie is  ... Just one of those films that you always enjoy.<br /><br />In my opinion, the conversion to blu ray format after the fact always raises the question &#34;could they have done this better?&#34; but it is a step up from the dvd.
B00881VLCE|4.0|I enjoy using this app after a long day.  It eases my mind and puts me in relaxation mode. Cool app.
B00164GDE6|3.0|I am a big fan of both the bad boys movies but really there was no effort spent on converting or upscaling the original movie to blu ray format. Probably why bad boys 2 has not yet been released on blu ray.<br />I bought par two on dvd, part one on blu ray and there's no difference to me. I'm not a video gurru but i can appreciate the general difference between blu ray and dvd formats  ... This is not a good example of bluray.<br />That being said it is still a great movie!
B004GUSG4M|2.0|I had been waiting a long time to read this book and it was terrible. I did not enjoy the plot and it was annoying because it was like the movie ground hogs day but a book. And I like that movie. I skimmed the last several chapters because it just became so stupid. Please don't read this book because it sucks!
030758836X|4.0|The first part of the novel dragged for me, but the second half from the crazy wife's perspective was a fast and interesting read
B000005EJL|3.0|I love Supertramp, even the Rick Davies/post Roger Hodgson brand and incarnation of the group.  As long as Davies' voice and piano/keyboard are there, it always sounds like 'Tramp.  Most of the songs are plodding but there are rare riffs and notes and vocals that harken back to the good old sounds of classic ST with Hodgson as a part of it (see &#34;You Win, I You Lose&#34;).  I wouldn't shun this recording but I wouldn't say it's entirely worthy of the rest of their catalogue, either.  Brother Where You Bound was the last near-classic Supertramp album (better than it was received in '85 because the loss of RH was so fresh).  If you're a diehard Tramp fan, buy it!  If you are not, pass on it.
B004LOMB2Q|5.0|I've used Onenote and tried other software but I find Evermore just works better.  Its easier to use and more intuitive than other similar products.  I'm using it even more now that many other apps integrate directly into Evermore.  The web clipping is good but with Chrome and Clearly I haven't found anything better to capture information from the Internet.  A solid 5 star application.
B007ZD17XO|5.0|Game is fun and you really have to focus. Sometimes you feel your eyes crossing...lol. it is fun and the graphics are good.
B007FEFLTO|5.0|My husband loved Ken Fillet books.  I wasn't a fan......or so I thought.After reading the first book of this trilogy, I was hooked........cannot wait until the third is published.
B00846REIS|5.0|It was a great book loved it even more than the 50 Shades of Grey and that was a good book.
B00CBKLO52|3.0|This is a great sim for RC flight training on the go, there are probably better ones out there but this one is great for what it is I like it and have not deleted it yet.
B003G4W49C|5.0|Orson Scott Card has put a bit of a different twist on the Sci-fi genre.  I am looking forward to reading the rest.  It will be interesting to see what the movie incorporates.
B005LAII80|5.0|Definitely one of the best action movies in years, and certainly one of the top films. I've never been a fan of comic books or Judge Dredd but this movie made me a believer. You certainly don't have to be a fan of the series to enjoy this movie. If I had to pick one movie to recommend it would be this one.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|Package is as described.  Arrived earlier than advertised.  Blemish free case and DVDs, with intact wrappers.<br /><br />The writing and acting are outstanding, and well deserves all the accolades I've heard it receive.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It really challenges you which I love, I'm so sad it is done at level 10. Definitely would've given it 5 stars of there had been more!
B0087GF8ZG|4.0|the light works well, motion sensor and light sensor are well tuned, on/off button works but looks like it could break anytime and is too small as well.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Awesome love it...........................................................................................................but really love games like this never thought it would be this good really you have got to play this game totally awesome
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|I just got to level 5 and got two more dinosaurs ! I just got to the aquatic and glacier level. Best game ever!!!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This is by far the greatest app I have ever downloaded. It's free there's so many things you can do. I would recommend downloading this app
B00E978FGQ|4.0|I really enjoyed this movie.  It's not going to win an Oscar for best picture, but that wasn't their intention.  I think this is a great movie to watch on date night or with your parents (or kids) because it has mass appeal.  It's funny and fun but with action and mystery, while not being too serious.  Enjoy!
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Very real,eye opening story,<br />Well laced with wit, humor ,abundant love and wisdom.  A book I shall not soon forget.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Not too hard, not too easy.  Fun way to pass the time and / or getting sleepy. I recommend the game.
B00CKJ2KK2|2.0|Why two? Well this game is awesome so fun but there is problems you only get two game modes, team death match only has two maps domination aka ctf has three maps really? Also connection problems... it's ridiculous I really wanna play this game trading how do you get disconnect from training and by disconnected I mean lose connection trading doesn't make sense I do good and get no stars.. don't waste your time on this
B009AY04A8|2.0|I normally love hidden object games and when I saw this game I thought it would be a good one to play. It had the potential to be fun, the different types of missions were okay but what made this one of the worst games I've ever played was the ridiculous amount of talking back and forth that couldn't be skipped. I've never wasted so much time just sitting and rapidly tapping my kindle screen.
B00B2V66VS|4.0|I am a novice gamer so this one really tests my skill. FUN and fast paced. Keeps me on my toes.
B004I8WD7S|3.0|Quite nice for the price but wish more clear plastic screen protectors were included as they seem to scratch some what easily
B009AY04A8|3.0|Nothing really standout great or bad about this game.  One star lost for the constant reminders to rate with no option to dismiss permanently. Another star lost for the ceaseless stupid dialog that must be clicked through one line at a time.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|To the scenes at a troll the troll the sky is kingchrisrocks to face of a scratch the troll brother of my little bit about it I really love
B00992CF6W|1.0|Why u take away the glitch??!!  And why didn't you put it on the phone? You are probably wondering why I'm complaining I just don't see why you did it
B00DDXJRJG|1.0|I see no difference what so ever. It is a total waste of good space.  Do not bother trying it!
B00ESY7QXI|3.0|Leo is such a wonderful actor that he made this film worth watching until the end.  The other actors were a bit boring and using Jay-Z's rap music for the soundtrack was just plain weird!!!! And it looked like the nightclub dancers were twerking at one point. I was hoping for a little cutting edge jazz music instead of \\"Dollar, dollar, bills!!!!\\" playing in the background.<br /><br />I hope they remake this film again with a period appropriate soundtrack and actors who can hold their own with Leo.
B00CWVG1Z8|3.0|If I hadn't read the book I would have liked it more, but so much good stuff was left out and changed that it could have been two different stories. I think the book was so much better. I didn't think they did a very good job with picking the actors with the parts either, some were nothing like described in the book which made it suck.
B00CA3C1N4|5.0|Nice game from an indy developer. Fun and additicting .<br />Stick with it and its a fun game worth the money
B00CH26TL8|1.0|Don't waste your time with this game, I found it to be very boring and a waste of time...pass on this one
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I didn't do a lot of homework before buying, my bad, but the Chromecast appears to be just another way to stream Netflix content to an already-netflix-enabled TV, and stream $ from your bank account to Netflix and Google. I expected a Ruku-killer, and instead got a Netflix-Google revenue producer.<br /><br />PLUSES? EZ to set up (note - you MUST use a wireless device to set it up with the CHROMECAST AP, not a wired one. Andriod phone works great. It give you a confusing Wi-Fi error message if you attempt to use a wired device).<br /><br />Also, nice and small- hides behind the TV. And even the USB cable is hidden if plugged into a TV USB port.<br /><br />MINUS? As NOT a Netflix subscriber, apparently the only content is TV reruns @ $2.99 (which I can get free on cable) or some old movies, also over priced. It says there is FREE content- all I asw was perhaps some old TV shows I never heard of.<br /><br />BIGGEST MINUS? I pay for AMAZON PRIME and have access to lots of content. Think Chromecast helps me stream that to a bigger-than-7\\" TV? Think again. No. Still stuck in 7-in-land.<br /><br />So far, the only thing I like about it is it's hidden, so as not to remind me that I just wasted $35.
B008RA3X5E|5.0|I've had th app for a while now and it's definitely a keeper. Dimming option, multiple alarm sets, local weather, and other nice features easily selected. Only thing I wish I could change is the color schemes.
B008ER9QKG|5.0|The extras were very informative. Watch \\"the making of\\" first for best viewing experience.  This is a terrific and memorable production, and I think the dvd gives the viewer an even better show than being there would have given because of the subtleties in lighting, props and staging.
B007TBZ63Y|5.0|Action in every chapter that keeps you hooked and coming back for more. It's almost impossible to put down. I can't wait for the next one to come out in October.
B00EEDJM2Q|5.0|This game is so addicting.  I love the simplicity of it yet it is still challenging. I recommend this to any hard worker looking to clear their brain at the end of your day.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|I use this app constantly.  Simple and easy to use. I tried a few other free apps and this was my keeper.

B00B0X4PIO|3.0|Was a little disappointed after reading his first two books. Th kite runner and A thousand splendid suns was hoping for more excitment
B001AEF6BI|4.0|Funny how my teenage wanted something I watched almost 30 years ago.  So, I got it,she loved it,watched in numerous times, and enjoye it.
B0017SWSCW|2.0|I was enjoying this book until about half way through, when it takes a absurdly unrealistic (given modern penal system operating procedures)and completely unbelievable twist. I had to read the twist twice to see if I had missed something or misunderstood something. I didn't.  I don't want to introduce a spoiler by describing the twist, but I will say it occurs shortly after one of the jail characters, \\"Nick\\", is granted parole. I couldn't continue reading after that.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|Storyline continues with several new twists along the way.  Each season has shown the changing social changes the world and especially England underwent during the early 1900's.
B0015RRNNE|4.0|Got this on a whim. Seems to be a colaboration between artists from completely different eras, backgrounds. It boasts complex musical arrangements that surprise and really work well.    At first listen, it will really make you sit up and take notice. This is really a unique collaboration, thus different from anything you have ever heard.    For me, a vinyl guy, this is a good purchase to have in my collection.
B008VIKLWA|5.0|What filmmaker can do is utterly amazing! Love this film from the beautiful cinematography to the exquisite depiction of the life of little Oscar! Watch it and appreciate it! It's a gift for mankind! Thank you Disney!
B009G8GRX6|5.0|I keep re-editing this review.  The more I hear the album, the more I love it.  Muse plays such beautifully complicated music, and their voices are magical. I wish they didn't use profanity (even though it's only one or two words.) Everyone does that and that's fine (I'm also a Greenday fan), but Muse never has and I'd prefer they keep it that way. Somehow, even that keeps Muse unique.  They stand on their music alone.  By the way, does the voice in Panic Station sound a little like Freddy Mercury to anyone?
B000TEPED0|4.0|I have enjoyed listening to this album for the most part it is pretty good like his voice would probably buy more of his music
B0082RHRHC|5.0|This book is a classic. How could you give it anything less than five stars. I love that I can read the classics for free with my Kindlefire.
B007V5XT1O|5.0|I love the whole album I have really enjoyed listening to the music one of my favorites to listen to
B00C7BZYRO|5.0|This is a theatrical review.  There may be spoilers.<br /><br />I think I will have to clear room on my Top Ten list for 2013 for this beautiful little film about two teenagers finding each other.  Director James Ponsoldt has affectionately taken Tim Tharp's novel and slowly allows the characters to fall in love while the audience watches.  I can't say enough about Miles Teller and Shailene Woodley's strong chemistry together which results in strong performances.  Nothing seems like dialog, just extemporaneous words flowing from their mouths.<br /><br />Sutter (Teller) is a high school senior who is perhaps best known as the class clown.  He's funny, easily approachable and fun to be around.  He's not a jock nor the smartest kid in school.  But he likes school.  His biggest problem is that he is drunk most of the time.  Sometimes just pleasantly drunk, sometimes very drunk.  One day after a party, he shows up on the lawn of a classmate he barely knows.  Aimee (Woodley) helps her mom deliver newspapers and her never-seen mom got in late, so Aimee scoops up Sutter and off they go delivering papers at 6 AM.<br /><br />The casting is perfect for this movie.  Both actors (and supporting actors as well) look and talk like high school seniors.  Neither are the traditional Hollywood studs and starlets you typically find in movies like this.  Shirts do come off, but the setting is right when they do.  While I suspect their looks were purposely dressed down, they look...well...average.  So does Sutter's ex-girlfriend and his best friend.  So does Aimee's friend.  How refreshing.<br /><br />As the shy Aimee and extroverted Sutter spend more time together, bad and good characteristics rub off on each other.  Each helps the other confront their mothers.  In Sutter's case, his mother (Jennifer Jason Leigh) won't tell him about his father's whereabouts.  It's been years since he's heard from him.  I expected the bomb to be dropped that dad is in prison or something.  You know, more Hollywood.  When he eventually gets the phone number from his married sister (Mary Elizabeth Winstead), he and Aimee make the 3 hour drive.  Unfortunately dad (Kyle Chandler) is a drunk womanizer, pretty much like his mother suggested.<br /><br />No matter how old we are, everyone can remember that first love.  It never leaves our memory.  I can promise that \\"The Spectacular Now\\" will give those memories a bit of a jolt.  This is an authentic film about young love.  Highly recommended.e Hollywood.

B00AYB1RGG|2.0|this was fairly awful, but it did amuse, in a painful way, sort of like the comic book, which is awful as well (and I have a ton of them).
B00EHAIHWM|4.0|I'm a little surprised at the lackluster reviews.  This is a solid album.  I think the mistake most people have made is in not buying the deluxe version of this album.  The deluxe version gives you a second disc of 13 songs live in the studio.  You get 8 songs from RTRWRA and 5 songs from the first three albums.  On this second disc is where the new songs shine.  Slightly different but still the same band we all know and love.  Spending a few extra bucks on the deluxe disc is the way to go.
B00EOO55GW|5.0|They ROCK! Can't get enough of them! Can't wait until they play a venue near where I live. Go go!!
B00EHF41QS|4.0|I'd give the deluxe edition 4.5 stars if I could. RTRWRA is a solid album, but I think the mistake most people have made is in not buying the deluxe version of this album.

B006ZAZ31U|5.0|This is truly an inspirational story. I firmly believe as a member of the military that we owe it to heroes like Adam Brown to learn about their stories.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|I am hooked big time.  I LIKE EVERY THING ABOUT THIS GAME.  I LIKE BEING ABLE TO IMPROVE MY SCORES.
B00EC7GRS6|2.0|At US$60, I expected this dock to at least include the AC adapter, which it did not.  It's just a cheap plastic base with a permanently attached USB cable.  I regret having purchased it, and I'll think twice before buying Sony products in the future.
B005CRQ4XI|2.0|I really did try to become interested in Cheryl, but this book is longer & more demanding than her hiking adventure which made no sense to me.  She seemed to be striving to resolve the loss of her mother although I just couldn't become sympathetic.
B00BEZTMQ8|5.0|but I should have waited to buy it until they came out with the second or third movie and bought the set,
B009ZQP42E|5.0|Great movie. Very funny. I would highly recommend this. Good for all ages. I enjoyed it as much as the play in NYC.
B0084IG7KC|3.0|glad I bought it on BR and didn't waste my time going to the show to see it. for me I should have just rented it, probably wont watch it again
B005SZNZAY|5.0|Chris Cornell really is amazing.  This cd is great because he plays all of his music and his version of Thank You (my wedding) song made me cry it's so beautiful!
B008JFUO4U|1.0|I wish blockbuster was still around because I have never wasted my money more until I bought this stupid fall asleep movie. it would have been a waste of money renting it from blockbuster but at least I wouldn't have to see that I wasted 20.00 every time I go to pick out a movie from my collection
0307887448|5.0|This book was recommended to me by one of my college Information Systems professors. He said that it was a fun read jjust for the references--he was right!
B000UJ48UO|5.0|one of the best war movies out there, if you like the real feeling of life in the service get this
B0097GVJWQ|3.0|Graphics are great. Game is interesting but like many other &quot;adventure&quot; games it isn't User intuitive. Wastes too much time guessing and going back and forth without reason.
B005544TRQ|5.0|It's like breaking bad but better. Law and order but more modern. It's well produced and has a exciting story-line.
B00AYB0TOW|4.0|I see why it did not do so good in the theaters. So so story, so so acting, so so action.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|Fun game for me; liked the graphics and the way the chips move when playing.  Only play as an indulgence; I feel like I am wasting time.<br /><br />Sincerely-<br />Mark
B005544TRQ|4.0|I think this show is very imaginative. The story lines are very unusual and that's great for an attorney show.
1781162646|5.0|I am a very big Stephen King fan and found this book to be really good.  Kept you guessing, as only King can, until the very end.  Would highly recommend.

B009NFHF0Q|5.0|Didn't know if I would like this book, but when I started to read it, I found that it took me in right from the beginning.  A great read.
B004I1AGTC|5.0|This movie is very different from the first movie, but I loved this one as much as the first. The plot was different than the first, and it definitely was not a repeat of IP Man. I recommend this movie!
B0063M22QO|5.0|I am so happy to have found this app.  I love the features and the graphics.  this is my new favorite app. good quality and fun!
B00640UICA|5.0|This game is cool and awesome!<br />It is great but not as great as MOVIE STAR PLANETS APP! I like computer games better but I l love my kindle fire too anything electronical!
B008FYZIVY|4.0|There is some tracking (?) issue on one disc. Not enough to return it . Great series to watch. Really enjoyed it.
B00EOO55GW|4.0|Good songs. The only reason I couldn't rate higher is compared to &#34;Nightmare&#34; it is not as good... Nightmare set the bar.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|I got this game for my granddaughter,<br />it s very funny, I like to play it too, very good!<br />Get it is fun
B00EOO55GW|5.0|A7X are amazing and this album is nothing short of brilliant!  A must buy!  It sounds a lot like Metallica.
B00499NHLC|5.0|I'm very pleased with this show. It is everything that was promised in all the reviews I read.<br />Word of warning if you are hard of hearing make sure you watch it on a device that supports closed captioning.
044024613X|5.0|My book club has chosen to read this book.  We usually meet and discuss when we are halfway through the book, then meet again to discuss the ending.  However, I can't stop reading, and I won't want to stop at halfway!  It's so tempting to go ahead and finish!  It's really a great read, and our book club will have much to discuss.
B006RZZ7HS|5.0|I saw this when I was 7 in the theaters. I watched it with my 7 year old and it was awesome. Definitely is dated in certain parts, but what a great movie.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|I COULDNT PUT IT DOWN! THIS BOOK IS VERY DESCRIPTIVE AND CAPTIVATING.  THERE WAS NEVER A DULL MOMENT. I HIGHLY RECOMMEND IT!
B00DFFI7K2|4.0|Enough already with the taking creative license keep the stories like the originals and stop killing off main characters.  If you keep to that formula then you could keep your audience, but with every change you lose the faithful fan of the animated show.  Just my humble opinion.  But the movie was worth a watch.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|Fun, cute game with awesome graphics! I love playing it and competing with friends. I wish there were more levels and ways to earn coins.
B00DP3IESY|5.0|Tom Cruise and Morgan Freeman, need I say more.  The story was fantasy with a dose of possibility so I enjoyed the action and the storyline. In fact I will watch it again.  So well worth a watch or even two or more (smiling). I do believe you will enjoy the movie.
B00881VLCE|3.0|The number and variety of their free puzzles makes it a tempting offer. The controls are very nice allowing you to select the difficulty and to separate edge pieces from the rest. The down side is that it seems to crash without warning. Make your moves slowly and that seems to help some.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|This is a great app and a must have for kindle fire. It is so amazing it will even ask you if you want to erase any remaining data from an app you just uninstalled.
B009LQKHIO|4.0|I enjoyed reading this book.  It had a good story line and the characters were likeable.  I would be interested in the next book in the serries to see where the story leads to.
B008Y73940|4.0|I enjoyed this one.  Good cast, good action.  I would recommend it to others.  Interesting story line.  Mathew Mc. does a great job as the bad guy turned good.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I love playing this game, it is a very addictive game. I wish that I could win a lot more often.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Anyone young or old(er) who is interested in or listens to Music MUST see this!  This studio was such a huge influence in launching the careers of so many artists going back to the 70's forward.  Dave Grohl was the obvious choice to direct and put this documentary together.  This will Rock you to the core!
B008Q0D32S|5.0|This movie has young Charles Bronson, Jason Robar, Henry Fonda and other familiar faces who round out the cast of characters in this Classic Great by none other than Spaghetti Western Master Sergio Leone.  Each character has his place and plays his/her role masterfully.  This is a must see, if you enjoy sarcasm, wonderful acting, duster wearing cowboys riding in gangs and the pursuit of conquering the West, when the railroad was being built.
B009KS4XRO|4.0|Love the game.  I play it daily,however recently the game has been freezing and when it restores the game is over.  It is quite annoying.  If it continues I might have to find a new bingo game.
B00B4Z5GDQ|5.0|Sound City is the place where Great Music was produced with the wonderful machine called ( I really forgot the name SVS,)  David from Nirvana, takes you on this wonderful history tour when music was music and not auto-tuned. Definately recommended.
B009AY04A8|2.0|I kept playing the 16 chapter story thinking it would get better. No such luck. Very repetitive with all people living in a mess , having to locate missing items. A few word puzzles and picture puzzles added to break up the boring story. The icing on the cake is the story doesn't end. Yes you need the next apt  to continue the next chapter.<br /> Since  I got this apt for free I won't give it a one but I have played more challenging and more<br />interesting stories. Not sure I will bother with the next book unless that one is free too.
B00DHKKN6Q|4.0|Very fun game my granddaughter has no problem playing and she is 4 years old good game for all ages
0064471837|5.0|I read Sabriel first in middle school and several times since, and I loved it every time. I prefer to remain vague about the premise, but the gist of it is two countries sharing a border, magic working in one, modern contraptions in the other. Sabriel grew up in the modern world, but must return to her native country to inherit her father's post of Abhorsen, tamer of the dead, protector of the living. The story moves from there into an original and sometimes extremely creepy world. I love the descriptions of the dead creatures that Sabriel must face, and I love the vivid locations she visits, and the people she meets on the way. I would recommend this book to anyone of any age, although the easily spooked should probably read in the daytime. It's so good, you'd be doing yourself a disservice if you don't at least give it a try.
B00CNGA1PS|5.0|The presenter's voice is so soothing.  These meditations are great for the ADD meditator who needs direction.  She guides you to wonderful relaxation.  Just what we all need after a crazy, busy day.
B000068QZK|4.0|No Rest For The Wicked is the first album to feature Zakk Wylde, and he does a good job with nice metal riffs that are very heavy-sounding and bold. However, most of the songs are for the most part just ordinary, and aren't up to the level of previous efforts. This album is straight up heavy metal, but with less substance. Songs like CRAZY BABIES and MIRACLE MAN aren't sophisticated, musically or lyrically. I do like, however, FIRE IN THE SKY, with its gloomy keyboard entry and generally dark tone and subject matter. I still give this album 4 stars, because it isn't bad at all; it's just inferior to other material that Ozzy has done in the past.
B005CRQ4XI|5.0|This is a great story of a journey that renewed the author's will and purpose.  Her life lost it's meaning after the death of her mother.  It was restored by an amazing accomplishment....more than 1,000 miles hiked on the Pacific Crest Trail.

B000XUDHBQ|3.0|This book was so highly rated and promised the drama of some great life-changing event occurring that my expectations were high. Instead I found this book to be very slow-moving and at no point was I gripped by the story. The event did occur but close to the end and . There was much descriptive prose that seemed a bit out of place in this book. I didn't feel I got to know any of the characters well or the relationships between them. I just felt events and actions were being related but didn't get any real emotions, apart perhaps from the relationship between the author and his parents. I wondered if I missed something along the way because I just didn't get as much from this book as everyone else seemed to.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|Best book I have read in ages, really touches the heart. Have recommended the book to friends and family. So good!
B008PQ8XZK|3.0|This story starts well with a dramatic event and we are then transported back in time to where it all started. However even when we go back in time we are also staring at the climax of something which has to be unravelled so it is easy to get confused with all the moving about. The story was good but all the things happening in 2011 were tedious and just kept interrupting the story that was occurring during the 1940s. The author could certainly get descriptive and go off on tangents about the most mundane things that I eventually started skimming through all the 2011 stuff. Laurel also managed to come to some conclusions that I thing it was impossible to do given the scant information she had about her mothers history. I almost gave up when at two thirds of the way through the book we started to discover more about the character of Vivien, this was far too late in a story to be introducing new and important characters. Also what we learned about Vivien and her husband all came from letters and reviews, just more lengthy stuff to wade through that just made it so difficult to enjoy the story which almost drowned in all the superfluous nonsense going on. There was a twist at the end which I did work out but not until close to the end. If the author had just told the story from start to finish this book would have been so much more enjoyable. I don't think I'll be bothering with Kate Morton again.
B002KF2HWM|4.0|I've seen it before and I'd see it again.<br /><br />First saw this when I was young when it came out. It was confusing and strange but I still found it entertaining.<br /><br />From then until now I've watched this movie 3-4 time and each time I seem to enjoy it in a new way. Sometimes it comes across as more comical. Sometimes the time travel aspect makes it a mind F for me.<br /><br />Either way though I'm sure to watch it again and it is most definitely worth a viewing if you have never seen it before
B006TF6WAM|3.0|I enjoyed the concept of this story, what Harold was about etc. I honestly do not think he would have survived this journey given his age, lack of preparation and how ill-equipped he was for it. So I was constantly being reminded of how unbelievable it all was and some of the characters that joined in on the way just made this even worse. However Harold is a very likeable character and that helped me persevere along the journey with him. He reviewed and assessed his life as he walked and we learned a lot about Harold, his wife, his son, Queenie and the complexities of their relationships. Everything was so different at the end than at the beginning of the book and it was beautifully done. Despite getting irritated with how far-fetched it was at times, the story came together at the end and really ended well.
B000FC2L1Y|5.0|This is the fourth book in the Outlander series, continuing Jamie and Claire's adventures. By now these are characters we have come to know and love and Diana Gabaldon knows how to write a mixture of historical fiction, adventure and romance that keeps the pages turning long into the wee hours of the night.
B002ROKQJM|4.0|This book really highlighted the vast difference between rich and poor in India and how little I knew about it. It was interesting seeing life through the eyes of the author as a child growing up in extreme poverty, how some people accepted this and how others strived for change. The wealth also was extreme and it was easy to understand why the chauffeur was prepared to go to extreme lengths to have part of that wealth especially in light of how his employers treated him. He was less than nothing in their eyes and I found myself on his side though normally I would not condone his actions. I really did not know how things would turn out until the very end.

B003XVYLDU|5.0|a masterpiece written in a groundbreaking fashion.  The narrative moves back and forth between reality and imagined in a beleivable way, portraying the damage suffered from Pilgrim's exposure to the bombing of Dresden.  A must read, even if it can be disturbing at times
B00B4VI8MQ|3.0|It's ok I tried it but thought it too simple and not challenging enough to enjoy it I think it needs a stronger story

B005P1YCNK|5.0|I loved Darren's book. It is very REAL and inspiring. This book is full of practical tools to become the best you. Simple application throughout the book and tools to get anyone on track or back on track for massive success.<br />I recommend this book to anyone who wants to execute greatness in their live. It does not matter where you are,  it will benefit you in a huge way. If you are already having great success read it and apply it. If you have been failing in lots of areas of your life and have been discouraged that you can't get ahead, read and apply. This is a reference book, not a one time read. Get the book, apply and change your life. - Lionel Wilson, Corvallis Oregon
B00BWBHIUG|5.0|Not only is this an addictive game it's very educational. My ten and eight year olds are learning all about ocean life while playing.
B005ZOBNOI|4.0|Where to start? Perhaps by the fact I thought I would hate this book with all my guts... It contains all the patterns of a book I would usually hate: cancer kids, struggling through life (which means the author kind of used this &#34;cheap escape route&#34; so he would get people to like the book, out of pity or such). I thought from the start one of the characters HAD to die (which is terrible in a book, because you're giving away one of the turning-points even before the reader finished the first chapter), unrealistic characters (it is very hard to find a teenager, let alone a bunch of them, with such an insightful perspective of life, though I could admit, may be one of the side-effects of dying) and I assumed I would find a desperate cry of hope of a life that clearly does not give a crap.<br /><br />However I found myself quite surprised as I went through the book and slowly started to appreciate the effort of the author. Although his writing would certainly appeal most female teenagers, as well as the physical description of the main male character, I could see the deepness of each of them as they developed. I found that the author was treating the subjects of death and how people deal with cancer with a sarcasm I didn't think I would find. As if he was making fun of his own work. He is surely then, aware of how people deal with sicknesses and this type of books. How people deal with that kind of pity that isn't really there because sickness isn't happening to them.<br /><br />So, I understood that it takes a lot of effort to write about such sickness with such insight. I thought it was easy to just spread that kind of shame around without much need of concentration. But this is a hard topic, it's hard to read about it, and it's hard to analyse it, let alone write about it.<br /><br />If you're worried about the cheesiness and perhaps what I mentioned above, don't. I could see how some people might get annoyed with it, however I'm asking you to give this booka chance. Leave aside the most apparent things in the book and look for the deep things in it. Maybe most people will only see the most unessential parts of it, don't be one of them. These &#34;flaws&#34; are present in the most superficial way possible, but the thoughts and the point of views, the experiences and the conclusions the characters reach, are up to you level of understanding what this book means. It makes you think. It makes you understands certain things, it makes you fall in love with the characters, it raises awareness and it's definitely thought-provoking.<br /><br />It leaves you with a tight knot tied up your throat, and to that I tell you, only the best books can give you that feeling.

B007WFTFG6|2.0|This app has tons of popup and definitely not all age-appropriate pop-ups.  I was reviewing it with my kid when I say an &#34;adult-type&#34; (not dirty, I think it was match.com or some something like that) ad.  I immediately uninstalled and found a different app.
B00A8ECU24|4.0|The game is great but charging real money to get main characters is ridiculous. It should also be tailored to what age is playing the game. The level of difficulty should be adjustable for whomever is playing.

0316228583|5.0|Ms Rowling has an amazing command of the English language.  SO well written, you can &#34;hear&#34; the characters speaking.  A wonderful book, incorporating and acknolwedging many aspects of typical English small town life previously not recognized in anything I have read.  Don't expect a precise plot or a definitive beginning, middle, end.  This book is about people, and life with all its turbulance and peculiarities.  A great read, especially if you have any experience of small town English living.  I hope there will be more like it to come.
B002LAM7PI|2.0|Great story and animation. However, not recommended for little kids as there are scenes that are very dark and may give them nightmares. Probably better for preteen and older given the themes and character development.

B009LDD54K|1.0|Some series lose their way; the 3rd season of BOARDWALK EMPIRE has successfully done that. The HBO series has some powerful names involved; Whalberg, VanPatten and Scorsese, but their names only lent money to the production and not quality. The props, costumes and filming are superb but the storyline is a disaster. You can almost tell where one of the producers said, \\"We need to add some black actors\\" and a scene using the contracted black actors is added. Characters from prior seasons appear out of nowhere and disappear as suddenly. If you haven't seen the first two seasons (even with the added 14 minute intro)you have no idea who they are and their place in the production. The part of the season that I found so absolutely insulting was the generous use of perverted sex scenes that were nothing more than the writers either living out their sexual fantasies or \\"sharing\\" with us their actual sexual practices. The scene where a small boy is exposed to adults engaged in sexual intercourse was absolutely unnecessary and added NOTHING to the storyline, which as I said, is wanting, fragmented and loses even the most dedicated fan. Hollywood writers assume viewers are ignorant and cannot see the obvious politically correct slants to their characters. All the blacks are \\"righteous\\" and \\"justified\\" in their anger at being held down by the whites--that highly exaggerated line has become very old.  The personal relationships are mostly based on adultery, betrayal and manipulation; we aren't even given a few decent love stories or decent human characters. The Hollywood writers contempt for Christianity is slipped (snuck) in with smug hidden little innuendos like the iron salesman who was a devoted Christian turning into a nut case.<br /><br />The storyline started out in season 1 with bootlegging, political corruption, gangsters etc.--and ended up with nothing more than gross perversions and absolutely no \\"heroes\\" (the good kind) for the viewer to identify with--sad at best.<br/><br />Great costumes--great props; horrible storyline. Season 3 proves money does NOT create quality productions.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|It was simply amazing,one of the best books I 've ever read. I love that action and the love story between the two star cross lovers.
B0064MGU98|5.0|I like the fact that the show combines a mystery with the background of several personal story lines....some that the reader has to figure out and some that only the characters need to figure out.  Extremely relevant plot premise considering all of the political scandals of the last decade.  Nice to know that the characters are portrayed as real people complete with flaws
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Full of surprises, the book is engrossing and satisfying. Worth taking on a long trip to read and enjoy. Liked it.

B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|Obviously the author has excellent sources.  At the beginning, I felt like I was reading &#34;The Jesus Dynasty.&#34;  Then I was on  a voyage of discovery.  The Church must hate this book.  Too bad we don't have genetic information from Jesus and his siblings.  That would put to rest the stories of &#34;virgin birth&#34; and &#34;only child&#34; that we are taught from childhood.  Looks like the Bible needs to be updated.
B003U4ZOQ8|4.0|I liked the first three seasons better but this isn't bad. A couple of interesting twists so far and I look forward to seeing the rest of the series.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I bought the book after watching the series.  Wanting to know the real story without the Hollywood spin.  Even though I enjoy the series, the book put the serious truth in perspective.<br />It was an eye opener into what a failed system is out there.  How unfair and unequal the sentences are doled out.<br />Thank you for sharing your experience.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|I absolutely love it! I look forward to coming home from work to watch this. I miss Downton Abby and was searching for a similar show to help fill that void.

0345528581|4.0|I'm going to be 58 in a month and I decided to give myself a fitter body for my birthday, so I bought all 3--the DVD, book and app. I'm in moderately good shape already--I walk regularly and lift weights (although I'm no body builder, by any means). I'm 5'9\\" and 162 lbs, BMI of 23.9 (at the top of the healthy range). My measurements are 40.5, 33, 41. According to my scale, I've got 24.3% body fat and 32.6% muscle.  Haven't yet tried the workouts, but can give feedback from having looked carefully at all three. Will edit this after my first 10 week cycle, to report the results.<br /><br />First, I thought the DVD was a video version of the book. It isn't. It draws from the set of exercises described and pictured in the book, but the workouts are not the same as the workouts in the book. They consist of different exercises and they recommend fewer sessions per week. The book, for example, recommends 4-5 20-30 minute sessions/week, while the video recommends 3 sessions/week. In the novice section, which I've watched but not yet tried, the workouts vary from 22-27 minutes/day. The book has 4 levels of fitness, while the DVD has 3.<br /><br />The strengths of the DVD over the book are: 1) It starts each exercise with an anatomical visual of Mark's body with the muscles that are being worked out highlighted. I think this will help me with proper form, because I'll know which muscle groups should be getting more tired. 2) The exercises are right there, being enacted in front of you, so you learn by watching and doing. Reading descriptions in a book just can't be as effective a way to learn. With the DVD, you don't have to page back and forth between the chart of program exercises and the description of the exercise and try to figure out how to do it. You just watch and do. 3) The DVD times your workout, so you can focus on learning proper form instead of timing.<br /><br />Second, while the DVD and book aren't just 2 different versions of the same thing, the book and app do seem to be just that. The 10 week programs are the same, but the app gives little video demonstrations of each exercise (if you remember to download the separate, free video add in). The app also has a timer, so you don't have to think about timing yourself.<br /><br />I think all 3 forms are valuable, for different points in the process of learning a new training program, and for people who have different learning styles. The video is great for the complete beginner, since it spells everything out and times you and takes you through the workouts. You don't have to page back and forth or time yourself, or mess with your phone, pushing on the next exercise. With only 3 workouts/week, it also allows for more recovery time during the period where your body is making the most adjustment to a new training system.<br /><br />The book/app has greater variety and allows someone who wants to to design their own program. I'd recommend it to people who have greater experience with this kind of training. If you want to keep the cost really low, the app seems to have most of the info you'd need to get going and see results. But the book has a lot of great info that's not in the app--detailed descriptions of the exercises, for example. I think they deliver the program best in combination--study the book and video portions of the app as you learn the exercises, and then use the app to guide you through individual workout sessions.<br /><br />To the folks who put these materials together, I'd recommend that you do the following:<br />1) The video needs more clear information about how to use it. It's set up in 5 sections: warm up, timed sets, ladder sets, circuit training, cool down. You don't say how to use these, so the viewer wonders, do I do all of these each of the 3 days? From having the book, I can figure that it makes sense to do the warm up and cool down and one of the other sections each day. But it's best to spell these kinds of things out.<br />2) Put an index of exercises in the book. When you're trying to learn a program, which are spelled out in a chapter after the exercise chapter, it's hard to find the specific exercise needed, because you have to go paging through the book. The app is much easier to find the exercises, but it doesn't describe, so the book should be easier to navigate.<br /><br />Okay, that's it. My morning coffee has settled in. It's time for me to hit my YAYOG gym! I'll report back after 10 weeks.<br /><br />October 20, 2013 update:  Still using the program and definitely feeling stronger.  Hit a snag, though. The app really doesn't work with the DVD.  I knew that the DVD programs weren't on the app, which has the book programs. But thought I could go into the \\"Workout Builder\\" and put in the DVD programs.  But you can't, because the types of set timing on the DVD are not on the app.<br /><br />For instance, the first day program is \\"Timed Sets.\\"  For each exercise, you do 4 sets consisting of working for 20 seconds, then resting for 20 seconds.  Unfortunately, there is no \\"timed sets\\" choice in the Workout Builder.  I looked at all the choices and none of them could be made to work in this manner.  Same thing for the other 2 programs from the DVD.<br /><br />Not a huge deal.  I'm going away and will have to take the DVD with me.  An inconvenience, but not a deal breaker.  However, the app producers might consider adding the DVD programs, or putting out another app for them, or at least putting the kinds of timing into the existing app.

1452000247|5.0|IMAGINATION AT WORK!<br /><br />Reading O'Brien's fairytale, I couldn't help thinking how wildly our imaginations throbbed before the arrival of television and the onset of electronic games.<br /><br />Of course, this story is not your ordinary, run of the mill fairytale. The word `Darkened' in the title is not there for mere decoration. In fact, I don't consider this a children's story--more like a wondrous escape for teens and adults. Even this squeamish grownup had to skip over some parts, yet William O'Brien managed to hold my interest to the very end, which is not a small feat--during the US Open, while Serena Williams is playing, and I could not tear myself away from the book.<br /><br />Why? Well, you encounter Mrs. Kipple, a warm hearted old lady, the owner of an antique shop where all sorts of keen, special objects glitter and sparkle for Peter to explore.<br /><br />Then there are many lessons you learn along the way, in the Jester's house, and on the journey to the fairy's grotto which mimics our own world, exposing many clever similarities:<br /><br />Seebright, the bird in a lavender vest with pink spectacles to see the world in a positive way. The mouse that needs Peter's help as he is too small to reach.<br /><br />Shylong who is so shy, he disappears into the background when people are present, but whose kindness gives him the measure to balance the power between evil and good, a form of our `rainy day people'. In fact, the whole adventure is about saving Shylong.<br /><br />The lifelongians who live long by not making waves and keeping the status quo, even becoming invisible.<br /><br />The path of information that gives Peter knowledge on anything he wants, a little like our own World Wide Web. As you wonder if he will ever get home, you read: \\"Doubt is unacceptable and should not enter you; it is merely evil trying to divert you and increase the difficulty of your task,\\" and you change a little. I highly recommend.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I hate this. Another company shoving extra garbage down your throat so they can make a buck. I don't even know what I'm looking at half the time and navigation is a nightmare. Disgrace. Even the weather has to be flashy? Bleagh. I have to give one star?
B006VFLIYK|5.0|The author introduces Will Robie , an assassin who is the ultimate solution to problems that certain Alphabet agencies need wiped off their \\"to do \\" lists. He will appear again in another stunning novel  THE HIT, but I recommend that you read this one first since the same characters are carried over into the second Will Robie book.<br /><br />Those of us who loved Vince Flynn will adapt easily to David Baldacci. This was my first Baldacci and I was driven to read THE HIT for more of the  same enjoyment. There are many similarities in the subject matter and writing styles of both authors. Admittedly Will Robie is not  Mitch Rapp but he is just as intriguing a character. On the surface he is cool,calculating,very observant, and a complete introvert. Good traits for an assassin. He is self reliant but has made reliable contacts that he can call on to provide confidential information and specialized equipment at the appropriate moment to pull himself out of hairy predicaments.<br /><br />In this case he softens his demeanor to save a 14 yr old girl recently orphaned by the same villains who seek to eliminate him.<br /><br />In the midst of all this chaos Robie and the girl are helped by a female FBI agent who finds evidence involving Robie in the murder of a woman and her baby as well as the  explosion of a bus full of people in which  Robie and the girl escaped unharmed.<br /><br />The author weaves a lot of edge of your seat moments in this \\"nail biter\\"'.  It is well worth the price of admission. It's a real 5 STAR attraction that will tempt you to go on to THE HIT to  continue the ride.<br />Rshepherd
B006IYG5HE|4.0|Another great Harry Hole tale. I enjoyed learning about Norway's role in World War two . Going back into the lives of the soldiers then and the repercussions today was very interesting. Mix in all the other murder intrigue and romance and you have a good story. On to the next No Nesbo! For those of you who haven't read the Harry Hole series I advice reading Redbreast first then Nemesis to understand the story better it's not an absolute must but I think it makes better reading.
B006AZZPCM|5.0|I love this app because my daughter sings allot in church and some times it's hard to find sound tracks at the store so we download sound track videos that are in YouTube throw this app  to mp3 format, also you can download live videos or whatever you want from YouTube.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Doesn't get boring I actually like this one but the hints take long to come back .<br />Hopefully it can b fixed&iquest; Thnx
B000YMM3CC|5.0|Wonderful two hours for a couple of old newly-weds!  The ending's a little twisted but non-the-less very enjoyable.  Breath taking scene in the swamp ... worth the wait.
B0002S94OS|5.0|A great album, good vocals, great riff work, in all areas and instruments. I would definitely recommend this album to Anyone who likes LOG, or most metal in general. Heavy, but not the heaviest, good for people newer to the heavier style music.
B00CATONCA|5.0|I really like the product but I found out its missing a severed head. Instead of five I got 4 heads. I received it that way. I miss package from the manufacture. Even more collectible.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|&#34;Lift Me Up&#34; is perhaps one of the best songs they have produced. Only problem is when I play this album while driving, I tend to play it entirely too loud and drive entirely too fast.
B0013527I4|5.0|perfect condition, great bargain!Wanted to get all of the Muppet Show in a collection but this was a better buy to purchase each season separately.
B0094BB4TW|3.0|It's fun to read all of it and see the pictures, but it does go on, and on.......can also be confusing to the older generation of non-tech readers.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|You can not understand anyone or any event without an understanding of the political and social environment at the time and this books paints a very clear picture of the time Jesus lived. He makes not judgement of Jesus as religious leader, but helps you understand the reaction of the society around him and the reasons for the evolution of Christianity from what was essentially a Jewish political movement. He also documents all of his statements and gives you a huge list of related reading material to further pursue the subject. What I am amazed at is the media frenzy about this book, Dr.Aslan lists dozens of other authors that have written on this subject, why did the media make such a buzz about his book? I think it was because he is a Muslim that they assumed that he could not write about Jesus and maintain a scholarly and factual based perspective. I think most of the objection to the book comes from the fact that it does not attack Jesus or Christianity but gives some interesting and well documented and supported facts about the evolution of the roots of  Christianity as we know it today.
1451695195|5.0|&#34;Proof of Heaven&#34; was published soon after my husband of 58 years died.  I bought a copy for myself and one for each of my three children.  I cannot tell you how much Dr. Eben Alexander's story meant to us all --- a comfort in our time of mourning, beautifully told, that buttressed our already strong faith.  I was fortunate to meet him at an authors' luncheon in Richmond, VA some time afterwards, and happy to tell him how we all felt about his book.
B0064MPXFA|5.0|Great series ... I did not watch it when it aired on TV and was surprised at how good it is. It is sharp, intelligent, suspenseful and the chemistry between the leading characters is palpable. I am now viewing the rest of the seasons. If you haven't watched and decide to do so ... you are in for a gem.
1594204217|5.0|Michael Pollan seeks to understand the four basics--meat over wood fire, slow cooking in pots, bread making and fermentation.  He compares these methods to the four ancient elements: fire, water, air, and earth.  He goes to the experts in each field and learns how to do each.

B00992CF6W|5.0|It's great so I made  this review. I looked at the pictures and I bought this app. It's not a waste of money. Buy this app if your a minecraft  fan
B005XQLBU4|5.0|I remember playing this game in the video arcades back in the 80's, when it was $.25 a play.  This version is even more fun.
B000LXQVA4|5.0|Bought this for a baby shower; it's really adorable.  Baby should love playing in this jumper!  This is a great baby gift.
B001F6ZIXC|4.0|I love this show! It is features some very lovable antiheroes who are good \\"deep, deep, down.\\" But I would want to warn any parents that this show is very violent, has vivid rape scenes (esp. in season 2), and is not at all okay for young teens.
B00CWY76CC|5.0|I was addicted to this game . do wish more levels come out soon. Got stuck a few times but managed to get through. Having  no instructions is part of the challenge.
1444737112|5.0|Wonderful, uplifting book. Should be helpful to many people who are battling their addictions.  Highly recommending this as a must read.
B00CATONCA|5.0|If you lose your instructions and wonder why the lights wont come on just push the 3 on season 3. Ha!!
B00AAQRNQ8|5.0|Arrived VERY quickly. Solid mouse. Great software perfect feel. good construction. People reviewed saying buttons are to easy to push I did not find this a problem. Not only that but the buttons sit out of reach when playing. Will recommend this mouse and this company (VERY VERY satisfied with their product and presentation). I am a solid Logitech consumer and stand by their products but this one is a must buy for the price and the features available on this peripheral
B00992CF6W|5.0|I like being able to make animals and glow stone and never reactive core.  A great game for all ages.
B00992CF6W|5.0|HOW DOES THIS GAME ONLY HAVE 4 AND A HALF STARS!!!! THIS GAME IS LEGENDARY! MINECRAFT POCKET EDITION IS ONLY 7 BUCKS! JUST TRUST ME AND BUY IT NOW. IT IS 30 BUCKS ON THE COMPUTER. THIS GAME IS A STEAL!--!!<br /><br />rock on freaked bros
B00AFROVQC|4.0|couldnt put it down from start to finish, it left you wanting more, a greeat read would recomend it to every one.
B007IXWL2C|4.0|I enjoyed the beginning of book 3 in the fifty shades trilogy, but a third of the way through I started to lose a little interest and then the excitement picked back up the last 1/3 or so. I love how e.l James ended the story, allowing me to use my imagination to finish a scene that was started. Then came the epilogue which was fairly long and very thorough with a fully satisfied; no questions asked type of finish. I liked that very much. It was a happily ever after finish that gave a peak into Christian and Ana a few years later; A well deserved ending.
B000LN7HUC|5.0|It's light, easy to use, brings 16 oz of water to a boil in about 8 minutes and appears to be almost indestructible. For less than forty dollars it's hard to beat.
B0029O0BLS|4.0|I'm very surprised this film tanked as bad as it did. It is rated the 48th worst flop of all-time. Sphere had a $80 million budget and got $37 million in domestic grosses. Sphere is a sci-fi thriller that is actually quite good with some excellent performances. It was based on the 1987 novel of the same name by Michael Crichton (who also wrote Jurassic Park). A spacecraft is discovered 1,000 feet below the surface of the Pacific Ocean. It features a great cast (Hoffman, Stone and Jackson are awesome) and the classic story makes this movie very enjoyable. Admittedly the ending isn't great, it is laugh out loud funny at times and the movie shamelessly rips off other films (somewhat successfully and humorously). It garnered a 12% fresh rating on Rotten Tomatoes but it is nowhere near as bad as that. It did manage to get a Blu-ray release with 15 minutes of extras and an audio commentary (the participants are recorded separately) while sporting very good picture and audio quality. *SPOILER* The alternate ending (sometimes shown spliced into the film on TV but not included in this release) does not feature the special effects of the sphere but only a helicopter flying off into the distance while the characters reach their own decision about what happened.<br /><br />Video Codec: VC-1/1080p   Aspect ratio: 2.40:1<br />Audio: English Dolby TrueHD 5.1, English Dolby Digital 5.1, French Dolby Digital 2.0<br />Subtitles: English SDH, French, Spanish<br />Special Features: Audio Commentary, Featurette (15 minutes) and Theatrical Trailer<br /><br />Buy this Blu-ray.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|I got bogged down a little with some of the history, but gives a different perspective of many Bible people.  I wasn't sure where the author was going sometimes, but pleased me in the end.  This book confirmed many of my beliefs.  Don't bother to read it if you're a person who takes the Bible literally and not willing to open your mind to other possibilites
B00005JKMQ|4.0|This is listed as the 45th worst flop of all time. After the theatrical version (157 min.) was released on DVD, Mann revisited his film, creating a new cut that ran for 165 minutes. Approximately 20 minutes of theatrical footage was removed, while 30 minutes of previously unseen footage was placed back in by Mann. If you like the boxer and were expecting Rocky action then you will be disappointed. This isn't exactly a linear story about Ali's life and rise to prominence. The focus is not on Ali's boxing matches but more about his personal life. I enjoyed it but found the narrative to be confusing at times. Those who don't know much about Ali will probably be lost for parts of it.
B00ECU2SGS|5.0|Good story, good actors, suitable for teen-agers, slight bit of violance.  This movie didn't get enough attention while in the theatres.
B00005JKLZ|4.0|The Time Machine is about a man who travels to the future in order to change the past. It doesn't look like there is a version available on Blu-ray for any adaptation of The Time Machine. This movie was based on the novel by H.G. Wells. It also had a 1960 film adaptation (which remains superior). This 2002 film is now out of print on DVD. That's amazing for such an iconic story. The remake has a great cast (Guy Pearce, Jeremy Irons, Samantha Mumba) but this film has many failings too. The score is memorable and wonderful. Some of the special effects shots work but not all. Pearce travels into the far future where humans (Eloi) are being used as food for a dominant species living underground (Morlocks). The story is fairly close to the original with a few exceptions (notably the visit to a library in the future and the ending).<br /><br />The main problems are casting Orlando Jones as a computerized librarian, Morlock attacks in the daytime and some badly edited sequences. As in all classic sci-fi tales the story comes across as old-fashioned to modern audiences but this version makes little attempt to push it to the next level anyway. Some have complained the relationship between Alexander and Mara doesn't come across since he just fell into the village and ends up sleeping platonically in her house. There are lots of little things that are problematic. The Eloi backstory isn't developed properly. Some of the special effects look great while others don't. One thing that always bugged me was Pearce running back into the time machine after being arrested in the future. The scene needlessly cuts to what looks like a stuntwoman in a red cape running along before Alexander jumps into the time machine and gets knocked unconscious. The ending has been changed and doesn't really tie up loose ends. Hopefully we get a deluxe Blu-ray with 4 hours of bonus content one day. Amazon reviewers rate it a lowly 3 stars.
B009NFHF0Q|4.0|A fantasy suitable for young readers and adults.  It would make a good movie.  This author has a great imagination
B00AYB1RGG|4.0|While I was not as happy  with the visual created in this movie initially, I was quite pleased with the storyline and overall movie
B00B5HQKNI|3.0|Was expecting a lot from this movie and it just didm;t quite deliver. Hoping for better from the next Bond film.
B000QRIGLC|5.0|I served during Vietnam, yet was brought to tears reading the account of Operation Redwing and the heroic battle and death these brave Seals endured. Liberals should hang their heads in shame. Thank you to all of our men and women in uniform.
B001DJLCRC|5.0|In my opinion, this is the best series ever on television.  It begins in Season One with gripping episodes- and then does nothing but get better and better throughout the next 4 seasons.  The acting is top notch, the plot lines are incredible and just about every episode leaves you saying \\"Wow!!\\"  Once you start watching, you won't stop.  The idea of basing a series around a couple guys making meth did not draw me in originally, but the transformation of Walter White from a timid school teacher to a drug lord is fascinating.  This is ground breaking, landmark television at its finest-  It's hard to believe that Bryan Cranston could go from Malcolm In the Middle to this series- and he pulls it off flawlessly.  I will miss this show when it ends, but it has set the bar very high for other shows in the future.
B00BD62X14|5.0|Carla Bruni has a great voice and musical talent. I have several of her CDs, and all are very good.
0143124544|5.0|This book is so well written, and I read it in just a few days: could not put it down, and it IS a PERFECT book for a Book Club.<br />But, just read it for yourself.<br />review by his wife
B009R6GN22|5.0|This book is well written and factual backed up by references and bibliography.  If you want to get to know the real Norma Jean or Marilyn Monroe this is the book for you.
B007VTVGAQ|5.0|Wow!  I had dismissed Fiona Apple years ago (after listening to Tidal) as a typical female singer-songwriter.  I was not excited by her first album, which I misinterpreted as yet another female singer in the vein of Sarah McLaughlin, Michelle Branch, and all those other 90s singer-songwriters.  I just wasn't excited by her first album.  Then people I respected kept raving about this album and I gave it a listen.  I am now a huge fan!  This album is unreal - experimental, challenging, moody and yet whimsical, jazzy and poppy, all at the same time!  Buy this album (and the preceding two albums)!<br /><br />This has my vote for the best album of 2012, even though I only discovered it in 2013.
B007XF4J70|5.0|Excellent movie.  The blu-ray edition is well worth the money for an older film.  I highly recommend it - you will enjoy it!
B008220C92|5.0|One of the scariest movies I have seen in a really long time and worth collecting. It's a \\"got to see\\"!
B0040HO01Y|5.0|This is a wonderful movie involving fascinating people who are such great actors and actresses. The events are interesting and I never get tired of watching the episodes. I was so sad to see that they weren't going to keep going with the lives of all these inhabitants of Lark Rise and Candleford. Mrs. Hamlin
B006N0YWGY|5.0|Lots of fun. I have spent too much time playing this silly game. Reminds me of friends I have from the southern states.
B000O8OTNC|5.0|I bought it for it's ease of use and portability and it is all of that.  It does the job for quick sharpens but it could definitely be better.
B004NELBPC|1.0|Doesnt work well with IPad since Video is often requiring Flash. App is also not stable and logs you often while readin and reentry to the app does not return you to where you left off. Also. Ery slow.
0307474275|1.0|This is the type of book that attracts me instantly. I love historical fiction or fiction involving history.<br /><br />But I know a hack when I see one.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code begins with a list of \\"facts.\\" It doesn't take long to figure out why this list is included: to give the ridiculous theories contained in the book some totally undeserved credibility.<br /><br />The Da Vinci Code supposedly reveals the \\"true\\" story of the life of Christ--which the evil, misogynistic Catholic Church has been trying to suppress for 1600 years. Of course, the \\"truth\\" turns out to be the age-old gnostic poppycock about a marriage of Jesus to St. Mary Magdalene, royal bloodlines, goddess worship, geriatric sex rituals, blah, blah blah. Some secret! Every tinfoil-hat conspiracy theorist worth their salt has heard this \\"secret\\" and even most of them dismiss it as ludicrous. Brown's notion that the Catholic Church has been suppressing the \\"divine feminine\\" since the 4th century is just as stupid. It is high comedy to a Catholic like myself who hears his Church attacked by those who think Catholics are *too* devoted to Mary, the Mother of Christ.<br /><br />But this is a work of fiction and Dan Brown's butchering of history would be tolerable if the book was at least a good read. Unfortunately, it is not. The writing is on a 9th grade level; the characters are paper cut-outs; the plot is contrived; and the \\"codes\\" are just lame. That the book is so dumbed-down just proves that The Da Vinci Code's primary audience is the terminally ignorant.<br /><br />All this Brownian baloney is thoroughly destroyed in a nice little book entitled [[ASIN:1586170341 The Da Vinci Hoax: Exposing the Errors in the Da Vinci Code]]. If you have read The Da Vinci Code and want to know the truth, read this book.
B0058VW36U|4.0|I got this game as a Free App of the Day on August 30, 2013, the second time that, according to prior reviews, it was given that aforementioned deal. In my honest opinion, I find this game a way to pass time whenever I feel bored, and I also like the capabilities of GameCircle. This game even has cute graphics, and even awesome music and sound effects! The only drawback, however, is the in-app purchasing. That's because if you want to buy something like superpowers to complete hard-to-clear stages. (This is why I am giving this review a four-star rating.)<br /><br />If you want something to pass time, or you want something challenging your whole family might enjoy, I recommend buying Cut The Rope because it is graphically eye candy, especially to small children or those who like cute monsters like Om Nom, the game's protagonist. And in conclusion, this game is a wonderful masterpiece with just one minor flaw - in-app purchasing.
B00908DDZM|5.0|what can I say that all the awards and recognitions haven't done for them and the goodwill stores in seattle?
B00COO2D6O|4.0|Excellent game keeps myself engaged. He keep wanting to play it and can't put it down. Only drawback like allof these games is the  in game purchasing.
B003BD236C|5.0|A good lesson on the ramifications of our actions. Well made with a slew of good actors. The third time I have bought it (first was VHS, second was DVD, this was MP3)!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I didn't know much about this book when I began reading it. I think that is best. This is a fabulous read. Beautifully written. I highly recommend it!
B000S56U42|5.0|I usually like that music that isn't played to death on the radio, and this fits that bill (for the U.S. market, at least - I hear it was played repetitively in Europe). Well worth the purchase price.
B00EI6E0QM|5.0|She's baaack!!! If the album is as good as this., it'll be the release of the year. Can't wait to hear the rest
1568363931|5.0|An invaluable source of knowledge for the basic bento enthusiast. I just started making bentos and this book got me going in the right direction.
0765325950|4.0|Disappointing end.  Saunderson not quite the writer Jordan was, but he die frightfully well.  It neither requires nor needs more words to describe it.  More Amazon overkill for extra unnecessary verbiage.  BZZZZ
B00622D3BS|5.0|Really good movie and great casting.  Highly recommend this comedy if  you are a Sreve Carrel fan. Emma Stone was also hilarious.
B007QJBHRS|5.0|This is a great classic movie staring Cary Grant.  It is one of the typical comedy/love stories he does so well.  They do not make movies like this anymore and it is our loss.
B005D9MUWY|4.0|This app is amazing. If I got close to the right letters, it knew the right word. Predicted the right words on the first day.<br />Rolling down the highway on the second day; got a call, and had to change directions. It wouldn't let me use the microphone to input my destination. Had to pull over to type it and get the sun off the keyboard. Uninstalled it.
B004G6009U|5.0|The box came perfectly, the image is great, the features in the bluray are great and my niece keeps watching it every day
B007I2BZIE|5.0|Essential for any RUSH fan, especially if you are more of a fan of their classic material.  I believe this album reflects their entire career to this point, and indicates their best may be yet to come.  Not a weak song on the record, and some of the best jamming in years.  I'd give it more stars if I could.
B00E3I3KDE|4.0|fans of ellie goulding who been waiting for this cd to come out. i think it is a good buy if you havent bought the first one. that she has out the halycon one.
B008Y73XTQ|5.0|This is an excellent, crystal clear movie in HD.  I didn't like that you had to constantly read the closed captioning.  I've seen this on TV in English.
B008XBCJ34|5.0|Unless you`re from another planet, you have likely seen this movie. I bought the 3D version as I was upgrading my big screen to a 65 inch plasma. It was like I was at the theater all over again. Well worth the price, and it was my first 3D movie for the sheer brilliancy of it!
B00004WEJZ|5.0|The last of Sean Connery Bond films is one I like very much, but it still isn't Dr. No or Goldfinger, it is still one I like very much. Yes! Sean Connery,  will always to me be best of all the James Bonds in The Bond Movies even today, with all new Bond Movies being still made. Like it said, &#34;Never Say Never Again&#34; to me, Mr. Bond.
B003E8P9G0|5.0|Lovely read. I enjoyed it from the beginning to end. You try the whole series. I can't wait for the next book
B0046B3QTG|3.0|Graphics great. Characters good and voices fit. Children steal the show and are bery cute. But the story line was just ok.
B00BEZTMQ8|4.0|I love everything about the book and the movie. I could have waited for the extended version but I really wanted to give this to my dad for his birthday. I would have given it a 4 1/2 star if I could but the reason I took off a star was the cover it came in was scrunched up at the top and the back had a hole in it. Everything else was fine.
B005D9MUWY|3.0|No custom dictionary?  And yet another app through Amazon that doesn't get the updates that come from ones in Google Play....that's a dealbreaker for me!
B0083ZBW2Y|5.0|I have read this book before and the ending is just so sad but it's still a really good and entertaining book
B00CRS5HII|5.0|Awesome! One of the best voices around. It's one of those albums that you just let play and enjoy every song.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I'm a 12 year old girl and I'm very mature for my age. Every one in my school, it felt like, was reading this book... even my teachers. I didn't want to read this because I thought it was gonna be super boring! I don't usually read children books. I read a lot of teen age books. I started reading this and I instantly fell in love with poor little Auggie and all the other characters! I recommend this book to anyone who is about my age and is very mature for there age, like me. Um..... If I spelt anything wrong, don't complain.... I'm only 12!!! ;)
B000IZAHB4|5.0|it was a wonderful movie that left me scared for my life and i loved it even more for that.
B004LOMB2Q|3.0|I can't use it and deleted from the kindle.  It is impossible to use with the kindle key board, which is too small for any kind of typing because the key board is too small.  It may import documents, but what good is that, except for reading them, when you cannot edit them with any efficiency?
B0066WJLU6|5.0|This is great.  try and you will like. if its to dark out when I get in the car I can turn my little light on and even when I'm in doors I use it<br />all the time.
B009KS4XRO|3.0|Love the game but find it frustrating not to be able to clear a level.  Is it intentional? Have moved on to other Bingo games that reward more frequently.
B00AL6SLQS|5.0|Having been a regular at Severance Hall since 1960, the Cleveland Orchestra under George Szell has set a special standard for me when it comes to clarity of sound and an uncompromising dedication to the score. In Leon Fleisher, Szell found a match of like mind that creates a definitive interpretation with unerring consistency. In particular, their recording of the Mozart is as good as any favorite that I could think of, and makes me wonder about what could have been. Listen and judge as I have since the original release on vinyl.
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|I love this game and now the game is even newer now you get a bus, a tractor,  a(n) dune buggy and lots more and the world's you get are amazing and so cool and you get an additional 2 more words since it has an upgrade on it now so yeah but this game it is so addicting I can't stop playing it at all literally.<br />Peace out
B00169N0BK|5.0|X-Rite has a more expensive product, but this meets all my needs. Monitor and printer are now profiled and give consistent results. Using the ColorMunki Photo to profile papers you use for printing will deliver much better results than using manufacturer profiles, because you are creating the profile under your environmental conditions. You can set up profiles for all your papers. Monitor calibration is essential whether you are using a very basic editing program or are a Photoshop maven. A calibrated monitor means you will edit with confidence, important if you want to go from your desktop printer to a lab for larger or specialty output. The system is easy to install and use, and you can set re-calibration intervals (do this). Combine this with their Passport product for calibrating your camera's sensor and you will have a consistent workflow.

B0092S4WLY|4.0|I really liked this one, hope they get more levels or another similar to this one. Played all levels, one every night until it was done. Good stress relief.
B00CM9JKQM|5.0|Queensryche were about dead after Dedicated To Chaos. I honestly think that it was the worst album I've ever listened to from front to back. After finding out that they split, I gave both the albums a chance since they couldn't be any worse than Dedicated To chaos. They were both released under the name of Queensryche, Frequency Unknown (with Geoff Tate) and Queensryche (with Tod La Torre). There was only one other difference, S/T Queensryche was a good album where as Frequency Unknown wasn't. Their new vocalist Todd La Torre isn't bad and sounds more like how Geoff Tate did in his early days. Musically it's a lot better than their last several albums, heavier and more progressive like their late '80s era. American Soldier was one of their best in a while and a an underrated album. I thought that it would be their last decent album for the rest of their career but I was wrong. Their new album is a step above American Soldier and the best they've done since '94s Promised Land.
B00133KFGW|5.0|One of the best movies ever made. So beautiful, touching, and inspirational! I could watch this movie over and over again
B0050DIWFC|5.0|Loved the courtroom scenes as well as the beautiful characters and their descriptive relationships. A bit more special to people living in the Boston area who will feel at home with the locale. Very enjoyable read.

B00DQAM5LI|3.0|The world today is a very strange place for METAL bands...That´s really not much things to do that haven´t already been done from past bands like METALLICA, MEGADETH, PANTERA or IRON MAIDEN....In the mainstream music world, the METAL style is almost dead....AVENGED tries really hard to bring some fresh air to the METAL world, but what i hear is almost COVERS from other bands with new lyrics...There´s some good songs like SHEPHERD OF FIRE, HERETIC, COMING HOME and DOING TIME....They sound like past songs from MEGADETH, METALLICA, IRON MAIDEN and GUNS N ROSES....I´m not saying that AVENGED is a bad band, but they sound like a POP version of old great bands!!!! Anyway, if the songs from HAIL TO THE KING play in the radio i will really enjoy, because these guys are the METAL mainstream of today....
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|If you enjoy costumed dramas this is well worth the investment of time to watch the series. The quality of the acting, the development of the characters, the story line and writing are all done in a manner that is engaging and at times riveting. Not to be missed if you are a fan of the genre.
B00004Y6NV|5.0|DIRE STRAITS is one of the greatest, coolest ROCK bands of all time.....I love all their albums, and ON EVERY STREET got great pearls like CALLING ELVIS, HEAVY FUEL, THE BUG and FADE TO BLACK!!!!! look, check all DIRE STRAITS stuff, it´s filled with the best ROCK you can find!!!!!!
B009AY04A8|4.0|I have played a few of nevro' s games and this one is on par of the others .  But there is the time limit and the 20 second penalty for missed guesses so that is a bit problematic,but all in all it is a good little game

B003XF1XOQ|4.0|Good end to the series if not a little predictable. Wish there were more books coming to the series but I'll happily take the movies. Viva Katniss Everdeen!
B0060V1WJ6|3.0|Good but slow. Nice story line with great actors. Nice way to spend a Friday night. Probably wouldn't watch twice.
B005MLOOJA|5.0|Started out a little like a soap opera however the writing improved and now it is a good, interesting story. I look forward to watching the episodes.
B00992CF6W|5.0|I can't place trap doors I saw it when I was making a tree house!<br />Please fix it so my finale part of my tree house
B004W1GCNC|3.0|Acting is typically British (good).  Story seems like a dead clone of Downton Abbey (which I saw first)  So now I know that Downton Abbey is a well done knockoff.  I liked D-A better than I'm finding U-D to be. Characters were more interesting. Hope it gets better.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|I would recommend this book to everyone. Possibly one of the best books I've ever read. So touching and heart warming and filled with love and emotion. Phenomenal book. Absolutely outstanding.
B003LQ3YXU|3.0|Seems like it could be entertaining. So far the first 2 have been OK enough to keep me going.  Certainly not something I will compulsively watch. Will need to be in the right mood.  Anyway, it has possibilities but isn't compelling.
B005CGI4EG|5.0|For the price, this is the best investment i could have done. Cd's don't come in separate cases but just in one stock, but who cares. it is so cheap, totally worth it.
0802798225|4.0|A tried and true (and therefore not incredibly original) combo of good girl/bad boy. This was an enjoyable read for me, and while there were plenty of clichés, a few twists kept it from being entirely predictable. Alex proved an interesting and likeable hero, and the backstories for both main characters made them believable. I didn't love a certain scene that involved some trickery, but I'll leave out any spoilers. Some of the dialog and inner thoughts rang true and some felt forced, so overall for me this was a 3.5, I liked it.
B0091REZMW|5.0|Cookbook addictive!!! Definitely a must have!!! Play everyday!!! Good for the eyes!! A luxury for the entire family. Saw my fiance playing and immediately downloaded it to my kindle HD n my phone.

B000V63C4Y|5.0|The vibes on this album are pristine. I am in love. Truely amazing. I have heard nothing like it, I want more music like this in my life.
B00785P2QC|4.0|Cool app. I just wish there weren't so many goals involving putting it on Facebook or Twitter and stuff like that.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|I'm not a fan of British dramas but found this interesting and witty!  The story line is a little contrived but Maggie Smith is awesome!
B00AB0Z88S|5.0|Love the Effects, and its sounds. The story is a bit so, so, but if you just wanted to see a real beautiful, well done effects in 3D, this is one of the movies highly recommended.
B00DLKXF3A|3.0|There is something very vanilla about this album.<br /><br />All upbeat \\"punk\\" elements from the previous albums are gone.  What is left essentially is Metallica with M. Shadows singing.  By AV7X's standards, the rhythm guitar parts are uninspired.  The drums are also simplistic.  I realize the Rev is not playing but some more fills and variations to the \\"boom tap boom tap\\" rhythm would be greatly appreciated.<br /><br />The lead guitars are done well but not particularly memorable.  I may give this a week or two in the CD player until I go back to City of Evil.
B005LAII80|5.0|Love the Effects, and its sounds. The story is a bit so, so, but if you just wanted to see a real beautiful, well done effects in 3D, this is one of the movies highly recommended.
B00E978FGQ|5.0|Great Movie!  There are so many twists and turns in this movie that you'll want to watch it a second time.  Loved all the surprises.  It's rare for a movie to catch me off guard, this was not a predictable one at all.
B004GUSG4M|4.0|A little repetitive but nontheless the story was strong and enjoyable. The end was a shocker, I didn't expect that.
B00EOFIYZA|5.0|Ellie High For This cover can be download for free on the Amoeba music website.<br />[...]<br /><br />I love the new song even though I could only buy 8 songs
B007ZXK08C|5.0|I would recommend this book to anyone in a relationship....it might prevent pitfalls. Or simply scare them out of it.<br /><br />Great as a supense story and very cleverly played out with masses of insight in human emotions.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|I saw the series first but like the book better<br />More details and I felt like I knew the characters already
B00CWY76CC|5.0|little bit harder than I thought it would be but still fun.  need lots more levels so that I can keep playing.
B00CQGU9GG|5.0|If you've never heard the First five ZZ top albums on London records on vinyl then you must get this box set.  Amazing! The blues rock Bible.  Billy F. Gibbons and Pearly Gates raw stripped down and analogue.  TONE, TONE,  TONE!  These are some of the sexiest mixes ever recorded for rock music.  If you play guitar you'll consider this box set essential listening no matter what style you're into.
B00AZMFK3K|5.0|best movie of the summer. greatest movie of all time imo great movie great great greta great great grat great
B00368CZN8|5.0|Though I do not own this movie, I have seen it online a few times and it is such an amazing movie. In my opinion, easily better than Cloud Atlas (A movie with a similar premise). I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who is interested in 'mind benders.'

B00DGNO3WE|3.0|This directorial debut from Dustin Hoffman is slight, but enjoyable.  My main problem with the movie: how to get past the implausibility that Maggie Smith - whose well-known voice seems bereft of any oomph and power - is somehow one of the world's best singers (albeit one past her prime)?  I wondered how Hoffman would finesse that at the film's payoff moment, when the four protagonists meet on stage: lip syncing? Smith's character turning tail? Ultimately, the director takes another path, but it's one that pays heed to this reality.<br /><br />On the other hand, the supporting players require no such artful dodging.  Hoffman filled out his cast from the UK's finest actors, singers and musicians from the 50s, 60s and 70s.  As he stated in any interview, these are people \\"whose phones stopped ringing years ago for no good reason.\\"  In that same interview, he noted their collective gratitude and willingness to work hard, age no matter.  That comes through on the screen.  Ultimately, what sticks with you is not the four main characters, but rather the small, sublime performances that the director lays in from these pros who still have their chops.  Of special note: \\"Are You Havin' Any Fun?\\" performed by David Ryall, Ronnie Fox and Trevor Peacock. It's a ditty that has stuck in my head since I saw it.<br /><br />And, it almost goes without saying that Michael Gambon's usual scene-stealing shtick is set on full power here and is well-worth the ride as always.
B001KDQ4KQ|5.0|This story about young love and the complexity of it kept me anxious for the next page. I'm onto the next Picolt book.
B003O86FMW|3.0|What more can I say that hasn't already been said? I felt this book was not as gripping and urgent as the others, but it was satisfying to experience the conclusion of this imaginative and riveting story.
B001NLKWLW|5.0|This book kept me reading, I made me fell as though I was there,sitting in the garden with Eliza and trying to help Cassandra figure out the past. My life stood still while reading this book. Can't wait to read more of Kate Morton's books.
B003XF1XOQ|4.0|What more can I say that hasn't already been said?  As someone who typically does not read YA, I found these books compelling. Couldn't put them down.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|This is a great read. The story is entertaining and draws out all types of emotions. The author's humorous, witty, and honest writing makes it possible to cry and laugh at the same time. By the end of the story the reader will be reflecting on their lives' secrets both told and kept and compare how things may been different.
B00CMQX84A|5.0|Since it was first shown on D. Channel my guys talked about this.<br />They had a very long car trip so I got it for them. was a huge thrill<br />for them and a good ride for everyone else.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|Well I tell you, now, after that many decades know why people &#34;abridged&#34; books. Victor has stuffed this book with so many dry and totally unrelated chapters that just blows. I asked a literature professor; what gives literate bro? He laughed and said Victor got paid by the words.
B00BMKDTNC|4.0|Well, after waiting YEARS to see how this story was going to end, I was happy enough with this final book.  It was good, BUT I didn't love the ending.  I won't say anything more, except that if you have read the other books in this series I don't understand how you could not HAVE to read this final one.
B00DW5IM9Q|1.0|I am a huge Dylan fan. Many of his newly (read several decades now) repackaged stuff is just plain atrocious. However, they are much much better than his concerts. I have gone to many of them just because 1) I am afraid he will die if I don't, and 2) I try to discern one, just one word he sings with that gravel-mouth of his with a (must be) feed tube stuck in there for good measure.<br />Oh, his complete CDs are coming and guess what?  I am buying them.<br /><br />By the way, I heard a recent interview with him, and, get ready.......he has a velvety smooth voice. Just doing this CD-skipping voice to peeve me:-(<br /><br />Love you Bob!  Loved you more oh...30 years ago.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Man, this book is really impressive.  I loved it.  I haven't been this choked up and worked over by a book in a while.  It was really impressive how the author maintained such a moving, serious, emotional tone throughout the entire novel.  I was really deeply immersed in this book; I will be recommending it to others for sure.
B008IGP8RI|1.0|Oh what can I say? It was a stupid buy for a CD full of really bad songs. I bought it for 1 song. I hear there is this thing called iTunes now.

B00BR4QNJ0|4.0|If I could give it a 4.5 I would.  My only problems:  Its extremely hard to win lvls further on without spending money.

B007SGM084|5.0|This book was hard to put down. It opened my eyes to my very own inner goddess. I'm also learning my husband's hard limits now. ;)
B00DB624GS|5.0|Finally!  \\"Then Play On\\" the way Peter Green wanted us to hear it.  \\"Under Way\\" falls right into \\"One Sunny Day.\\" The \\"ssh\\" at the end of \\"Although The Sun Is Shining\\" falls right into \\"Rattlesnake Shake.\\"  I have to admit that I grew up on the US November '69 release, and that one is a good, arguably better running order.  But this one is what Pete released.<br /><br />\\"Then Play On - Deluxe Edition\\" is the best audio version of this album to date. All of the drop outs on previous CD versions are gone.  This is particularly noticeable on \\"My Dream\\" which always sounded like an 8-track tape jostling against the tape head.  The CD artwork shows tape reels that look like master tapes but I question if this was taken from the masters.  There is no mention in the CD liner notes.  I had heard they were badly damaged or gone completely.  So you audiophiles may be disappointed. But I am quite pleased.  It sounds as good if not better than most of the other albums from that era.<br /><br />My concern going in was \\"Oh Well'\\" being included as bonus tracks in the form of the single, Part 1 & Part 2. However, unlike the Part 1 single version that appears on \\"25 Years - The Chain\\" boxed set, this one does not fade out.  It has a hard stop and then Part 2 falls right in.  The result is that it sounds like the Parts 1 & 2 version that Warner's cobbled together for the November '69 US release.  Again, the audio quality is the best yet.  I had hoped that someone would join both parts without the repeat, giving the actual running time of seven minutes.  But since it was never released that way, I won't complain.  It's easy enough to make your own edit now that both parts are released as separate tracks.<br /><br />The other two bonus tracks are Peter Green's last single with the group.  \\"The Green Manalishi\\" sounds slightly better than other releases.  But the disc ends on a fittingly weird high note.  \\"World In Harmony\\" is not the same version from \\"Show Biz Blues.\\" I assume it is the original single.  The lead guitars are mixed with a bit of reverb/echo that ultimately sounds like a symphony of guitars - in harmony.<br /><br />So in the end, buy this disc! Peter Green has provided an audio account of his feelings during that period of his life, however disjointed.  There are a range of emotions that appear in no particular order throughout the disc. The moods are powerful, funny, sad, scary and touching, amongst others.  They are all heartfelt.  In essence, this is what the blues is all about.  Congratulations Peter!  \\"Then Play On\\" is an aptly named genuine blues album that was and is like no other.the original single.  The lead guitars are mixed with a bit of reverb/echo that ultimately sounds like a symphony of guitars - in harmony.<br /><br />So in the end, buy this disc!

B0056FMNYA|5.0|This has got to be one of the coolest things I bought for my camera gear. When I got this it was a pretty unique item, now there are a few copycat products (which may or may not do a better job) but the Evo is perfect for me. Attach to belt or backpack, I keep thinking about buying a second, the price is just a little high vs me not having much need for two most of the time.

B0001I562I|5.0|Growing up I saw this movie, it was actually better than ET in my mind, which is kinda similar if you look at it from a overall perspective. I think it is a must watch for any 80s child and any current child.

B00C7JG0KG|3.0|It was OK for a wizard of Oz version movie. It did not have enough 3D effects for me. The story line was kind of boring. But, nothing can beat the original movie version of the Wizard of Oz. I do not think it was worth the thirty-seven bucks I paid for it.

B00571F26Y|5.0|I think people who are obese really need to read this, or people or can't lose a pound<br /><br />I think when you get the body into a fat burning state it can take/process the wheat, but you need to drop wheat to get to that state<br /><br />I have reduced my wheat a lot and it's shows, and fast.<br /><br />It's too bad that the wheat industry along with corn and soy are like tobacco and oil companies.  We need more local organic wheat, I would pay more for it without a hesitation

B007J4T2G8|4.0|The author gives you the ability to feel the exquisite sensations.  Live the erotic adventure through the eyes of Anastasia.
B0030N3O8Y|5.0|Action and plot twists come so fast that I'm constantly on the edge of my seat watching as many as 5 episodes in one sitting.  I'm always wondering, &#34;How are they going to get out of this?&#34;  Frequently, they are on the verge of closing a case, when a twist of plot sends them off on another crisis.  It just never stops.  So I have to stream the next episode to find out, and then the next episode, and the next.  It's violent, a bit over the top, and quite often politically incorrect.  No job could put so many people under that much pressure.  But it makes a great TV series.  In one way it's an escape from reality, but it's not what I would call relaxing.

B00DHHWY9I|2.0|The 1974 film adaptation of \\"The Great Gatsby\\" starring Mia Farrow and Robert Redford shines in comparison to this Baz Luhrmann interpretation.  That's not to say that Carey Mulligan and Leonardo DiCaprio as former flames Daisy and Gatsby (respectively) didn't do a very good job.  Tobey Maguire as Daisy's cousin, Nick (also the film's narrator) did especially excellent work attempting to add depth to a very shallow production. But overall, this movie is more spectacle than substance.  Seemingly taking for granted that everyone is familiar with the story of a \\"self-made\\" man trying to recapture the past and steal the woman he lost years ago away from her \\"old money\\" husband and lifestyle on Long Island, NY -- relationships and characters are not developed at all.  Instead, the movie focuses on frenetic visuals and relies on Nick's voice over to provide the narrative.<br /><br />I streamed the movie in HD and it is quite lush and beautiful; however, it is also obvious that it was shot to be viewed in 3-D and images frequently seemed to be coming at me from the TV.  In addition, the camera has a very limited atttention span for most of the movie, jumping from image to image, scene to scene at a frenzied pace.  This works kind of okay during high-energy party scenes (of which there are too many) or when cars are racing down the road, but the roller-coaster-ride-like editing significantly detracts from any actual story telling (of which there is too little).  The juxtaposition of Fitzgerald's ripe and serious words with over-the-top scenery, staging and cinematography makes the whole thing seem farcical.  Fitzgerald sometimes worked as a Hollywood screenwriter, but he meant for \\"The Great Gatsby\\" to be his great American novel; ultimatey, the pages of a book may just be the medium for which his story is best-suited.<br /><br />There are glimpses of the story's heart in the movie.  The best scene is when Gatsby reveals his relationship with Daisy to her husband in front of Daisy, Nick, and their friend, Jordan (played very entertainingly by Elizabeth Debicki). The camera finally takes a back seat and the actors are allowed to meaningfully interact with each other.  And again, Tobey Maguire is quite adept at conveying his point of view in every scene he's in, even if he has no lines and is being upstaged by grandiose sets or the 21st century soundtrack, which is so out of place.<br /><br />If you're familiar with the novel (and if you're not you may feel lost watching this movie), you'll notice that this screenplay takes quite a few liberties.  It is ironic that the movie ends with Nick reciting the last words of the book verbatim, which convey what the story is supposed to be about: the elusive American dream that we continue to believe in long after the possibility of realizing it has faded.  Fitzgerald made it clear that Gatsby's pursuit of Daisy is a metaphor for this. The problem is, the two hours plus of the movie that precede those final words need to support that, and they don't.  Instead, they convey that the 1920's were actually roaring.  Yes, the ambience of the movie does a good job of portraying the opulance and \\"anything goes\\" mentality of the Jazz Age.  But that ambience consumes everything, including any social/moral commentary because it's hard to take seriously anything that's so over-the-top.  Personally, this period in American history boasts my favorite architecture and fashion, but too much is too much!  The movie also would have been better served by keeping references to bootlegging and criminal activity as subdued as they were in the book; Gatsby comes off too much like a gangster here, making Nick's elevation of him odd.<br /><br />It would have been interesting, given that the themes of the story carry through to today, if Baz Luhrmann had updated the time period and not just the score, and explored what a 21st Century Gatsby would look like.  But the creativity in this Gatsby lies in the choice of upstaging the story with spectacle; if you choose to watch it, do so for that or you'll be disappointed.  I might have enjoyed it better if I'd seen it in a theatre.
B00DQBWLSO|5.0|I really like John Mayer's writing and guitar playing skills.  He has moved on to the level of his example, Eric Clapton.

B009AY04A8|4.0|played through the whole game. I never do that...and especially not with hidden object games. Skip the dialog tho...its pointless and smothered in lame sauce.
B00CDV6WDS|5.0|I really enjoy this game.  All the different shapes of the tiles is neat.  I have not even played all of them yet.  I have always enjoyed the Mahjong tile game for a long time.  The game has changed from the first one that used to play.  The new look of the tiles is neat and enjoy seeing different tiles.  Glad I downloaded the game.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|I was pleasantly surprised to read that many positive relationships were formed in prison. I guess I underestimated women and their capacity to care for each other. So glad to know this.
B009G41CG2|3.0|This game is a little harder than I am used to.  The older one would let you shuffle to get all the tiles and this one does not and I get so exasperated for I have not won that many games..  I still play with it just to see if I will win.
B00E8KLWB4|3.0|I enjoyed this game. It is basically a hidden objects game with many different rooms. the downside is that you search for the exact same items over and over in a room.  All in all it is an enjoyable way to pass the time.
B007X4ECMI|3.0|There are so many things this movie got right.  The pacing was strong, never slowed down, never effectively threw the camera down the stairs (I'm looking at you Michael Bay), or diverted my attention to cleaning my house.  The sets were cool, the computer animation up-to-date, and the casting was great.  This is a movie I'm glad Guy Pearce took a chance on.<br /><br />The big negative was the lack of any sort of quality bad guy.  Some other reviews have pointed out parallels to Escape From New York, which is very apt, but that movie had loads of great villains (even in some sense the main character).  Lockout essentially has an psychotic tool yelling and hitting everyone with a hammer.  It didn't fit with the rest of the movie, even falling into slasher flick territory.  I know they were trying to make things visceral or claustrophobic, or maybe give an edge to an otherwise loopy spacecraft plot, but it was (almost literally) ham-fisted.<br /><br />Still, as most of the other reviews point out, I enjoyed myself and I *definitely* recommend this to fight boredom or help get you through a cold.  Good fun.
B0064X7FVE|1.0|I loved the old Weather Channel app! It was accurate and easy to use. I was on it quite a bit. But with the update a couple of months ago, I find it challenging to switch between locations and it takes the radar even longer to load! Why would anyone care about unlocking achievements on a weather app??? Ridiculous and Dumb! I'm going to try out other weather apps and hopefully find one like this one before the &quot;upgrade&quot;.
B004XJRQUQ|5.0|My fave can't wait for the movies very good book though and the current movie helps a lot!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!<br />Yay me
B0046B8GEQ|5.0|Woot! It has Good guys, Bad guys, and MINIONS!!! A good family friendly movie that stands up to multiple viewings.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|John Green is the boss. TFiOS is beyond deep, beyond wonderful. If you don't cry with it, then you're not a human.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|such an amazing game and the minions are totally adorablllllle! and fluffy is awesomeeeeee its so fluffy im going to die!!!
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|It's so fun and some of the questions are hard and it keeps u entertained. I love this app so much!!
B00BOXZAG6|4.0|Well ,I just fell in love with a movie. In all my years ,I have never seen anything like it. This is one of the most creative ,visually spectacular , love stories to come along in many a year and in 3-D it's a must have. Is it perfect no, but it sure has enough in it to say I'm glad I added this one to my 3-D collection.
B0058VW36U|5.0|I love it omgeee I'm 8 so I know what I'm talkin about k so it's fun for 5 and older,<br />got to go GREAT GAME
B005GSZZ1A|4.0|Like most Americans I suppose, I had no idea of the inhumane treatment of many North Korean people.  This book described the life of a young man born in a work camp, destined to be a slave.  There he learned self preservation at any cost.  When he managed to escape adjustment to free life was difficult, much of the problem due to his inability to trust others who were helping him.  A good presentation of the problems of adjusting to freedom and of the problems presented to nearby free countries in assimilating and helping such persons
B005BRS8Z6|5.0|15 years ago, I was wandering in a Barnes and Noble and ran into this book - I thought I would scan through the table of contents and voil&agrave; - a shot of wisdom lite for me!<br />I had no idea one of the agreements 'Nothing people do is about you' would hit me on the head so hard. That one agreement echoed within me for days, helping me redefine my environment, my relationships, the way I took responsibility for, well, most everything.<br />I didn't buy the book that day, nor for years - very uncharacteristic of me - which allowed the thought to slowly sink within me and complete its graft.<br />Then I did buy the book (ha!) and let the rest do its work. The 4 thoughts are 'simple' yet very powerful - all the more so if you act upon them. Well, actually, powerful thoughts are always 'simple'... but they may come at a time in your life when you really need them and you're ready for them. Throughout the years, I've had an ongoing 'conversation' with the agreements, tailoring them - or reality - to make them fit each other. It's been very interesting and rewarding, in terms of inner peace! So get the book if you want to do a little rearranging of soul, heart or mind;0)
B00AG473IC|5.0|This has been on constant repeat in my car for two months now. I freaking love this album despite the fact that I'm 10 - 15 years on the farside of their target demographic. I love the energy of this album which is so hack and cliche to say, but it's a very cheeky kind of fun not an irritating sanitized poppy kind of fun. Their sound vaguely reminds me of The Pixies, Sonic Youth, and The Black Angels all mashed into one screaming, coked-out mass of pop/punk goodness.
B0031RS7MW|2.0|The book had an interesting potential, something strong, pagan, gypsy-ish, a whiff of the opposition that took place centuries ago in Europe between the old gods and the jealous new One...<br /><br />But on the one hand you have a not-wannabe witch protagonist who DOES want to be normal, even suggesting at some point that her truly wild woman of a mother kidnapped her from her (I was going to write 'Muggle') normal family; who 'has powers' but will not use them - what is it with witches who want to stay in the broom closet!? - and thusly leaves us in the dark as to her true capacities, and misses the Magical Realism genre boat altogether. The old Armande certainly has more insight, daring and power than she does. Also, Vianne claims no kinship with the gypsies, which bothers me because she's been in their boots exactly and now looks quite 'bourgeoise' and established.<br /><br />And on the other, the 'Bad Guy', if you will, is a priest, 'the Black Man', the embodiment of everything she and her mother feared, as women, as witches. That could have been quite a revolutionary and daring lead - if Joanne Harris had taken it. But the scary boogeyman is quite defanged; he monologues in every other chapter, describing 'Vianne Rocher' with positive superlatives (he isn't supposed to do that you know, he's supposed to see reality through his own prism, and therefore use derogatory words where someone else would use praise; same subject, different viewpoints), he's stuck up and deeply steeped in hubris... but honestly not very scary. Also he has a Secret - but who cares?<br />Ok, he will speak in the pulpit against the vice of gluttony - that does not pack a punch, and furthermore he stops as soon as he's feeling ridiculous. Then again, what did Vianne expect? If you settle in a small French village, you WILL get curious stares, not open arms, and sometimes downright hostility, especially as a foreign unconventional unmarried mother! And I'm not even going to mention Corsica! Of course you will get the bigots, the people who never traveled to the next county, the judgmental appraisals, the wafer-narrow-mindedness! That happened to my family and we're French!<br />The story develops slowly as there are not strong pushes toward climaxes and anti-climaxes, everything turns out well, even when Vianne tells Jos&eacute;phine to confront her violent, drunk, abusive husband. Who of course doesn't manage to hurt her anymore (hum, so much for wishful writing - he could have beaten her to a pulp, but of course he doesn't and considerately leaves town).<br />Joanne Harris delights in the description of pâtisseries, forgetting maybe that most of them are regional - but good for them if she can make them all. The whole country is rightfully proud of its culinary tradition - I doubt anyone, even a priest would condemn chocolate delicacies, especially in 1995. It is important to remember France is Catholic, not Protestant, and as such has always partaken in things that horrified our soberer neighbors - all that gilding, all those jewels in church, all our baroque and gothic splendors, food as gourmet art - oh no, the Catholic church renounced nothing!<br /><br />About the movie; it is tighter than the book, I love all the actors, but it is watered down even more by making the Mayor the antagonist, not the priest. By that point it loses all 'oomph', although setting the movie in the 50s does help with the general atmosphere of rigidity, and adds something to the transgression of consorting with gypsies. Johnny Depp can only be Juliette Binoche's love interest, not a secondary character's like Jos&eacute;phine, so it's cute and quaint and completely devoid of backbone.Of course you will get the bigots, the people who never traveled to the next county, the judgmental appraisals, the wafer-narrow-mindedness!

B008PCVGKI|5.0|This is scary stuff! I am a student of Naturopathy and we are used to having the mainstream medical profession pointing the finger at us, while they stand on their high moral ground and say that the Alternative/Complementary therapies are unscientific and have not been researched properly, while their treatments have been researched. Well folks, read this book! (Please see my review for &#34;Bad Science&#34; for a better &#34;sciencey&#34; evaluation). Let's hope that Dr Goldacre's books might spur the medical/scientific communities into a large wake-up call to realize that their high moral ground of research is suffering from a major landslip and something akin to the Emperor's New Clothes.
B00DU77QP2|4.0|After reading some cutting reviews about TMI...<br /><br />Well, I liked it.<br />It probably helps that I'd never heard of the writer, nor the books before.<br />It also helps that I was not constantly comparing this work to others - no one has dibs on hero dynamics, plot turns, family-related surprises, vampires-werewolves etc, betrayals, 'magic' etc etc... I find it much more rewarding to come to a book without too many expectations, and especially without a Genre Encyclopedia-chip on my shoulder. It becomes a conundrum for many readers; they love the genre (magic, fantasy, urban fantasy...), so they want to read more such books, and then obviously they complain because it reminds them of previous ones.<br />Guys, EVERYTHING has already been written. If you want to keep reading (or watching movies), you're going to have to suck it up.<br /><br />So.... off the top of my head, this book was MUCH better than the Percy Jacksons, or the Beautiful Creatures, or the Summon the Keeper (of which I only read one, so I may not be completely equanimous). Alright, so there was some awkward exposition, I still haven't figured out how that universe works (I wonder why I'm more interested in this than almost anything else when I read fantasy/uf...). Yes, the heroes are angst-ridden teenagers (you like YA? That's what you get), yes there is an awkward love triangle, no, I don't understand the appeal of the heroine... Alright.<br /><br />But overall, it was a pretty tight plot, things moved along, the dialogue was unexpectedly funny, there were some interesting twists, Jace is very enjoyably arrogant (I actually like arrogant characters), AND not everyone is good. The heroes' parents were not 'the good guys', they messed up quite spectacularly.<br />There are interesting references - finally no more 'talking down' to teenagers; Bosch, Diego Rivera, Blake... There are nice settings - the Downworld diner springs to mind.<br />Also some more subtle things; Clary keeps saying Isabelle is a bitch, but Isabelle never actually does anything bitchy to her - prejudice and insecurity from the main character, not the writer. Also, on the subject of prejudice, those kids are going to have to examine their own racism - which is perceived by other characters but not by them.<br />Characters' gestures and movements were consistent with their state of mind (a pet peeve of mine 'she glared at him, sighing' - impossible). Also, they grew. Also, domestic violence, abuse, homosexuality and again, racism are addressed in the book.<br /><br />Yep, I like it. On to number 2e is a bitch, but Isabelle never actually does anything bitchy to her - prejudice and insecurity from the main character, not the writer. Also, on the subject of prejudice, those kids are going to have to examine their own racism - which is perceived by other characters but not by them.<br />Characters' gestures and movements were consistent with their state of mind (a pet peeve of mine 'she glared at him, sighing' - impossible).

B002RI9ORI|5.0|An essential book for anyone, whether you're involved in medicine, science, any of the (so-called) alternative therapies, or a patient undergoing and/or considering undergoing treatment. I was taught that science was all about either proving that something works, or it doesn't (i.e. you demonstrate that the hypothesis is proven/disproven, then you produce a method that can be replicated by anyone else, and freely give your information to the world). The proving that something does not work (or has such bad side effects that its efficacy is not worthwhile) is just as important, for the advancement of scientific knowledge, as the proving that it does work. Ben Goldacre has produced an epic opus that clearly demonstrates numerous examples that all the medical/scientific community seems interested in is publishing a biased, lopsided array of &#34;good news&#34; studies, while the balanced (bad news) studies are ignored, much to the detriment of many lives lost because of lack of information being available. It's a very sad and scary situation, but thankfully Dr Goldacre's book (also &#34;Bad Pharma&#34;) may be a catalyst to spur the scientific community into changing their ways.
B00571F26Y|5.0|Great information, changed my family's diet and we feel so much better!  What originally was a healthy grain has been so modified over the centuries that it is no longer healthy.  Everyone should read this book!
B00D3V85FA|5.0|I love Black Sabbath old and new ! Ozzy still has it vocally and Geezer and Tony still jam like they are in their 20s....
B00D6B4PUG|5.0|Just right for my Kindle when I am on the go. Very easy to manipulate this app. Really love it
B009AY04A8|5.0|so fun kinda freaky but i like that its freaky it feels like you're really there! u should try it.
B000WTBMBK|5.0|I don't know if I can say anything new about this album.  It may be the best album I've heard in 10 years.  If there was a movie called \\"driving through a deserted city at night\\" this would be its soundtrack.<br /><br />I'm sad that a human created this.  I almost wish that this was outcome of the sound of urban decay.  The sound of a city getting older.<br /><br />Listen to this at night.  walk through alleys, or drive at 4 am when there are no cars, and flashing lights every block.  I don't know what else to say.  It won't make you feel good, but it still can be comforting.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|my family and I had great fun playing this game together. some of the puzzles were hard to figure out alone.
B003O86FMW|5.0|Interesting with many twist and turned  but kept me reading till it was over<br />The best book ever that I read
B009POCG2C|5.0|I enjoyed this movie that i pre-ordered. It has a good story line along with good actors. If you haven't seen it watch it.
B00E9PMMX0|1.0|I love Star Wars, but what's the point in releasing this? The folks who want the altered original trilogy have surely bought the blu-rays already, and the DVDs have been out for years. What we want are the theatrical versions of episodes IV-VI. I refuse to buy a Star Wars blu-ray until the theatrical versions are released.
B0083SBMBM|5.0|Fast shipping and great quality. this is one of my grandson's favorite movies! we have watched it numerous times and many more times to come.
B003ITZBVS|5.0|Even though its on netflix now,my kids got to enjoy this sooner thanlater. Ok eally it ws just for me but i used the kid asan excuse hehe
1609611543|5.0|Excellent, life saving information.  If you want a really good summary, there is a chapter summarizing information about wheat in another excellent, life saving book - \\"You're not fat, You're toxic\\". [[ASIN:0989589900 You're Not Fat You're Toxic, Your Permanent Weight Loss Program]]
B0048Y9TPG|3.0|i only got this for my wife, but she seemed to enjoy this a lot so i will give it a good 2 thumbs up.
B0090X4GLW|5.0|We loved the music from the movie so much we had to buy the CD.  If you loved the movie, buy the music too!
B0031RAOVY|5.0|very good copy.I like it. In comparison with the professional this copy is excellent.keep up the good work guys.thank you
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|BUY THIS immediately.<br /><br />As the title suggests... this is the best thing ever.  It is by FAR the best $35 I've spent in like... a decade.<br /><br />When I bought it, they gave a way 3 free months of Netflix (INCLUDING people who already have an account).<br /><br />The ability to stream from my phone/tablet/PC/laptop ... and for only $35?<br /><br />Not to mention Google is going to continue support and development of this amazing little device...
0307341577|4.0|A must read- Probably one of my favorite Gillian books. When is the next one coming out! I want more!!
B00AYB1TP0|5.0|I got the free version of this a few days ago, and promptly bought the paid version when it kept the kids entertained for longer than I expected.<br /><br />This app has some features that others don't, such as puzzles for each letter. The best part is there is no catchy kid's music, so it doesn't drive the adult in the room crazy. The animations are cute and the little crabs that cheer the kids on are adorable.<br /><br />I will absolutely be checking out the other apps by this company.
140006922X|5.0|I gave this book as a gift to a very good friend who happens to be a Catholic Sister and she loved it.  When she opened it she was overjoyed.  She said she saw it in the bookstore and started to read it, she really wanted that book - so when she got it, she was so happy.  She said the title was so appropriate - because truly what Jesus was preaching was radical, and the whole zealot movement of the time of Jesus is well articulated in the book.  When she's done, I get to read it.  This book will compliment both the secular and religious - more the &#34;thinking religious&#34; as opposed to the blind faith-types, from what I understand.  I can't wait to read it.
0307352153|5.0|Truly an insightful and inspiring book! If you have an introverted personality you must read this book! It will teach you so much about yourself!
B00BYM5I1O|5.0|Guy Clark is without a doubt as colorful of a person as his songs - his writing brings the 2 together and what you get are songs filled with very real emotion - with his health failing this recording is all the more special because he refuses to not put his soul into it. The most stirring and moving song on the CD is the title track. The back story is of a picture that he pinned above his workbench taken years ago of his wife, Susanna, after she came home to a house they were staying at and found Guy and Townes Van Zandt totally wasted. She stormed out of the house and someone snapped a picture of her. It's moving in part because it is a reflection on the woman he loved who was loosing her battle with cancer and of their life together as it was. This recording is released just over a year since her passing.<br /><br />This album get's high marks due to Guy Clark as we expect him, true to himself and true to his craft.
B009GIPDQS|4.0|John Grisham has returned to what he does best, legal thrillers.  This book takes the same format as The Pelican Brief fast paced, cleverly thought out plot with the good guys beating the bad guys at their own game. A welcome return to what he does best.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|I got this game for my 5 year old grandson to play in church so he would be quiet.  Guess what?  My 20 year old grandson also loves it!  It keeps them alert, quiet, and really works on hand-eye coordination.
B00CEQ1HOQ|5.0|It was exactly what I was looking for. My niece was so excited to get the doll because she's collecting them.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Really liked everything about the book until the final chapter where the author tied everything together in tidy bows.  I found the ending disappointing and it diminished my overall opinion of the book.
B00DTMCSO2|3.0|Could improve in many ways, picture quality was poor, controls were very limited, and the game was too easy.  Not very realistic.
B00ATDOVNK|5.0|It's another great game! The story lines are interesting, and the clues aren't to difficult to figure out! It's got great graphics and kept me hooked the whole way through! Love it!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|I have noticed several of you saying that even though the game is free, you have to pay $200 to complete the game.  This is a total lie.  While you can buy gems or bits with real money, this is not required.  Playing the game 5 days in a row gives you 2 gems.  You also get gems for leveling up and completing quests.  I have beaten the game with out spending a single penny.<br /><br />I am a very dedicated brony (a male of any age who is into MLP:FiM) and I don't agree with a lot of the choices made by Hasbro and Gameloft, such as putting Sunset Shimmer with the Mane 6 or making the prices for some ponies so high, but those who allow themselves to believe that the game requires hundreds of dollars are just impatient.  THE GAME ONLY TAKES 6 MONTHS TO COMPLETE!<br /><br />Also, dashie is awesome
B002HJ9PTO|1.0|Just got this mic in the mail, first, battery is so difficult to squeeze in and second, does not work, at all, ;( will never buy equipment from this maker. ;(
B007J4T2G8|2.0|So I finally broke down and read this book.  My husband and I were going to the beach for a week and I was loading my Kindle with \\"beach reads\\" and I thought \\"why not?\\"  I have to admit that while the book was a great catalyst for some sexy fun it was hard to get through it without laughing out loud at the writing! It was truly an easy read.  I think it's written on a third grade level!<br /><br />I can't give Shades 5 stars but I can thank it for a great couple of great days at the beach!
B00513F9Q6|5.0|As for every required summer reading book for any high school student, it's heard from previous readers that the books are dull and boring; the rumor for this book was no different. I found the book to indeed be a bit slow through the first half, but it quickly picked up pace as the end approached. Granted, this was a required reading, but I slowly found myself reading more of Cat's Eye and being able to relate to the events and characters as I got farther along.<br /><br />It's possible for everyone to find some part of the book to like, be it if you're a physicist, an artist (or, put it in better terms, \\"painter\\"), a school bully, or someone yearning for nostalgia of their childhood. Definitely one of the best summer reading books and one I will definitely read again when I get the chance.
B0044C5SCU|5.0|Good series although what you think and hope is going to happen happens.... Sorta! If you like the first and second series then you are already hooked and I don't have to tell you to watch this anyway ;)
B006BDHAX0|4.0|One of my favorite games. I can play for hours<br />I don't know why I have to type so much
B004FOA84A|3.0|Really liked it but got to a point where we couldn't get anymore items to move on in the manor.  Kind of stuck.  The items we have won't work any were in the house.  Helpful hints?
B00CATONCA|3.0|Packed with the heads individually wrapped with no instructions on how to place them to float...Also they advertise it to  light up failing to mention the fact you have to buy lights and bulbs. Overall I'm sure it will look nice once I can figure it out.. it I think instruction s for setup woulda been nice.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I<br />Is a great game but I do not like all the adds that pop up. Thank you every much
B00C1BV9Z6|1.0|HD my ass.....and for $3.99....no thanks. What a rip off. I'll stick with Netflix. The picture was all pixelated to the point that it was unwatchable.
B00005T7I1|5.0|very underrated and very underappreciated film.<br />best comic strip gangster flick I've seen in ages! =D<br />Al Pacino and Warren Beatty are great!
B0083Z3O8Y|4.0|This is the second time I have read this book and it never fails to please.  Love the language and can visualise the characters clearly.
B0089LOG02|5.0|This is a beautifully well-written story. It is sound and thorough. The characters are well-developed and inspiring. Such an experience it must have been to be a child on the orphan trains. You will be so glad you have read this book. Bravo, Ms. Kline!
B0012GTZC0|4.0|Eye of the Needle kept me on the edge of my chair - it truly was difficult to put down. There were a few spots that were difficult to swallow, but for the most part it stayed within the realm of reality.<br /><br />Ken Follett is an excellent author.
B000HKYOK0|5.0|Perennial classic and still the best of all of the Star Trek incarnations, although the newest films are pretty darn good too
B001AZFO14|5.0|Old but nice movie...it´s about soldiers abandoned for his country bureocrats!!!! Old but nice movie...it´s about soldiers abandoned for his country bureocrats!!!!
B00A8KJK7G|5.0|My nephew just received this for his birthday today it got there so fast I only ordered it 2 days ago and he got it the day after his birthday I was late on ordering it. But he was very happy my sister said he loved it!
B0017SWPXY|5.0|One of the best book I've ever read..I recommend it highly. If you love dogs,you well certainly enjoy this book...
B007PVHMCG|5.0|For our 8 year old, who is obsessed with Minecraft, this was a unique gift and allows him to lay down the IPAD for some traditional fun.  Little pricy, but worth it considering we could not find this locally.
B00BUCW54Q|4.0|I didn't expect much from it before viewing it. It surprised me that it is not the typical Cruise movie. It is more mature and more grounded. There are exaggerations like most action movies, but Cruise fits very well in the character, and Robert Duvall is good as usual. It's quite enjoyable.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This is a very entertaining game. Its a great way to relax and have fun with horses. I definitely recommend it.
B00DP3IGJ6|5.0|I have been a sci-fi fan since a child. But not many sci-fi movies succeed in both the plot concepts and the visual experience. Oblivion did a fairly good job in both. The plot is well constructed and quite intriguing, the visual effect is impressive. I would highly recommend it.
B005K0HDGE|4.0|King is not 'literature'. But his characters are much more three dimensional than other 'popular writers' such as Grisham or Dan Brown. Once I got past the time-travel premise,I was transported back to the early sixties. The portrait of Dallas of this era felt especially realistic. All in all a great summer read.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Don't judge a book by it's cover. You will like this show, even if you are a man. I promise.
B006DJ2JSI|4.0|Clicking a search dialog box brings up a key board. Start typing the word and a list of possibilities appear. You select your word and the definitions are displayed. The use was very intuitive. Much better than the dictionary which comes with the Kindle Fire .And the best of all, its free.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|This app is ok But when I first purchased this is was great. The app has changed and I do not like it. I would like to have the original app back.

3836538725|5.0|Not only an absolutely stunning collection of images, but the text in enclosed booklet really elevates this to much more than fabulous pictures; they reflect a man who cares deeply about our planet and our future on it. Thank you, Sebastiao Salgado, for making this book possible and at a price most people can afford.

B00992CF6W|5.0|This game there is nothing you can't do. It's a world made of blocks that has creatures called mobs that Rome the night. Some of those creatures are creeper, zombies, skeletons, and spiders!!! I'd recommend this game to people that like to build, explore, and mine in caves!!!!!!!!!!

B008602KQI|3.0|The Hunger Games is much like Solvent Green in today's time period.  However, more realistic was \\"Solvent Green\\".  The cast was excellent, as well as the Story it's self.  I do highly recommend this for 18 years to adult, below that age level it would be far too hard for the younger youth to comprehend what it truly was all about.  My congratulations to the following:<br /><br />Directed by<br />Gary Ross<br /><br />Writing credits<br />Gary Ross  (screenplay) and<br />Suzanne Collins  (screenplay) and<br />Billy Ray  (screenplay)<br /><br />Suzanne Collins  (novel)<br /><br />Cast (in credits order) verified as complete<br /><br />Stanley Tucci  ...

B000QRIGLC|4.0|Where would we be without brave men like these Seals? Fighting a war with no end in sight. Thank You for all that you do.<br /><br />JSM
141659521X|5.0|This was a gift for a avid Vince Flynn reader.  It came in very good condition as it was bought used.  Thanks.
B009MYAQK4|5.0|I enjoy any work by Paulo Coelho.  This work had many Biblical references much like other scrolls.  The format of posing a question and then the scroll &#34; answering&#34; was interesting.  I would highly recommend if you like Coelho's work.
B009IU6BIS|5.0|The Griswold's are back trying to celebrate the perfect Christmas but forces, as always, are against them...or perhaps Clark's expectations are just too high.<br /><br />The acting is appropriate and hilarious.  The characters are farcical and well acted.  Dialogue and situations are at times bizarre yet fitting for the Griswolds.<br /><br />Overall, a fun movie!
B004GUSG4M|4.0|This was an exciting novel from the beginning and ended with an unusual twist.  Christine was a likable character and her circumstances were quit believable.
B002JODUI4|5.0|This collection involves a blend of electronic, vocal, rock, and pop elements.<br /><br />Each tune merges masterfully into the next allowing the listener to merge with the music or just dance along.<br /><br />Overall, a fun ride!
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|A good movie to watch one time. I don't need to see it again but I'm glad I watched it
B007FKI9G0|4.0|A band, Spinal Tap, goes on the road trying to rekindle their past glory.<br /><br />From half baked rockers to overbearing girlfriends, the band tours the states trying to reclaim their past fame.<br /><br />Humor is present throughout this film.  While some content (clothing, hairstyles, etc) is dated, ultimately, it can either be seen as recycling in culture or just be found funny/bizarre.  The acting is superb.  Dialogue and character interactions are authentic.<br /><br />Overall, an entertaining ride.
B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|I never felt that Self Portrait was as horrible a listening experience as the reviewers usually spouted.  To me it was an album of someone playing the music he enjoyed listening to.  The outtakes and alternates add an extra dimension to what was an already decent adventure.  Excellent addition to anyone's Dylan collection.
B0055B7IPE|5.0|This film starts with the romance/life of Carl & Ellie.  After Ellie's passing, Carl lives alone in their house.  When he loses the house, he takes is to South America, and unwittingly, also takes Russell from the Wilderness Explorers with him.  In South America, they encounter adventures neither were expecting.<br /><br />The graphics are quite good.  The characters are well developed and continue to develop as life/the story progresses.  Humor is also interspersed throughout.<br /><br />Ultimately, this a growing experience for the characters in the story.  Life doesn't always turn out the way we plan.<br /><br />Overall, a heartwarming & humorous tale!
B004CFBMRY|5.0|Loved it from start to finish.<br /><br />Lots of story, but lots if real interesting facts about the body and running.
B00DC8O6T8|5.0|Primarily a collection of electronic and pop elements blended together.<br /><br />Between some tracks, there is a definite pause; however, this does not greatly detract from the listening experience.  It helps to signify the different musical elements used and simply each new track.<br /><br />The tracks are typically peppy, fun, and easy to dance about the room whilst playing.<br /><br />Overall, a fun and danceable ride!
B00A8ECU24|5.0|This game is great for any M.L.P. fan! It lets you bring ponies back into the town! Including the Mane Six. I say it's a great game.
B00C061I3K|5.0|On this collection, there are both electric and what some refer to as robotic tracks.  A couple include a nice blend of orchestral music and some with a jive flair for a bit of variety.<br /><br />The entire collection allows the listener to relax, chill and/or dance as he/she feels like.<br /><br />Overall, a superb experience.
0061726834|5.0|OH MY GOD.<br /><br />Seriously.<br /><br />I literally just finished DELIRIUM, and now I want to just explode. Halfway through this book, I ordered the second one, because I knew that I was going to want it. But it won't come in the mail for FIVE MORE DAYS... Just kill me now.<br /><br />Yes, it was that good. With a hell of an ending. OH. MY. GOD.<br /><br />So...there are a lot of mixed reviews for this book. Some people hated it, some people are obsessed with it, and some people were just \\"ehh.\\" For me, I don't know what it was, but I was hooked right from the very beginning. I absolutely loved the premise. So original! So awesome! I'm fangirl-ing all over the place right now! This was my first book by Lauren Oliver before, and now I just want IT ALL.<br /><br />DELIRIUM was just so crazy-freaking-good. I loved how the main character, Lena, wasn't a badass right from the very beginning. She wasn't Katniss, she wasn't Triss...she was commonplace, she was ordinary, she was just following the system because it was all she'd ever known. In the beginning, we get to see from her perspective why the idea behind this society -- \\"curing\\" people from the \\"disease\\" of love when they turn 18 and matching them with life partners -- is a \\"good\\" thing and why she is so excited to go through the procedure. When Lena learns that her friend, Hana, isn't as excited about getting cured as she is, Lena is upset and feels betrayed and confused.<br /><br />I really enjoyed getting to see Lena grow, be courageous, and take the initiative to learn about what has been going on behind the scenes, because she is truly worried about her best friend. And when Lena does see what is truly going on in her society, she realizes that everything she's ever been told is. a. lie.<br /><br />There were a few things about this novel that did bother me, although I was so into it that they didn't take away from my overall enjoyment of the novel too much. I was debating rating this a full-on 5 stars, but there were just too many discernible faults that I found throughout the story.<br /><br />Firstly, there is barely any world-building. We know kind of a lot about how the society works during the time that the novel is set, but we don't know anything about how it got to be that way, besides a few sentences that basically went: \\"People realized love was bad...now everybody gets cured.\\" Obviously that just isn't enough information. But I'm hoping that, since it's a series, we will learn more about that later. For me, as long as the world-building makes sense in the time that it is occurring, I'm okay with it, and it doesn't usually affect how much I like the novel. But it's still a flaw that it has.<br /><br />Secondly, I didn't really LOVE (ha.) the relationship between Alex and Lena. It wasn't totally \\"insta-love,\\" but it did move kind of fast for my tastes. Although, I do think that you can kind of justify that by thinking about how Lena has never been exposed to love or the kind of feelings she starts to have for Alex before. She's never experienced it, so I think that it's kind of natural, especially as a teenager, to get caught up in those brand-new-love emotions and get carried away, and end up moving fast. There was also a time issue at hand...they are sort of \\"making up for lost time\\" in a way, because Lena's curing date is coming up fast. It wasn't necessarily the fast-paced relationship that bothered me as much as that, because it was quick, I had a hard time liking them together as a couple. They didn't really seem to have anything in common or ever really even have conversations. There was a lot of Lena thinking about Alex and reminiscing about time spent with him, but not really a lot of scenes with them actually being together.<br /><br />So those were the two big flaws that I found in Delirium, but like I said, I still LOVED THIS BOOK. Like a lot. I can't wait to find out what happens in the next one! I have a huge to-read pile, but I don't think thatI'm going to be able to stop myself from jumping right into PANDEMONIUM once it arrives on Wednesday!I'm going to be able to stop myself from jumping right into PANDEMONIUM once it arrives on Wednesday!
B000Y90VO2|4.0|An American pop singer is recruited as an international spy with hilarious results.<br /><br />I am not including too much so as to not give away too much plot.<br /><br />This film I have found have multilevel gags so that additional humor or puns can be found upon additional watching(s).  However, this film is not for everyone as not everyone enjoys this type of humor and some will say a portion of the humor is too crass.<br /><br />A number of the gags are sight gags so attention to detail is necessary while attention to the dialogue is also necessary for that humor.<br /><br />Overall, an intricate humor.
6304711905|4.0|Great for guys.  Don't watch with young kids.  Some scenes a little violent.  Modern classic with an old western feel.
B00CWY76CC|4.0|Fun and moderately challenging but needs more levels.  Engaging and colorful pictures and puzzles.  Would definately recommend for relaxing entertainment.
B00164CM46|5.0|Again a guy ritchie flick. Brad Pitts &#34;pokey&#34; speak is actually something he made up himself because he was unable to nail down the  accent for this flick. I say it worked out pretty good
B00CWY76CC|4.0|fun game although I wish it had more levels... can't wait for new ones. hope it doesn't take forever, I'm not very patient.  :)
1589944607|5.0|This is an awesome game. I played it before I had seen the show and I loved it even then. Having seen the show I may appreciate it just a little bit more, but that is not a requirement by any means to enjoy this game. It is very well done and almost always ends in such a close race to see who will win. The distrust and subterfuge definitely add a lot to the fun. I highly recommend this game.
B00E1L9N8E|5.0|I love a great love story.  This move was entertaining and fun to watch.<br />DiCaprio brought his character to life and it was intense and crazy and wild!<br />Fabulous!
006212725X|1.0|Rubbish .Boring stories from a boring person.A waste of time.Did this ridiculous guy really write all<br />that great music?What a disappointment
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|Gosh, I've watched this film about 100 times!  The Hobbit is sweet and shy, yet brave and daring!  I LOVE this film!  Fantastic characters, the dwarves are funny and Gandalf is...well he's Gandalf.
B005ZMV2EQ|5.0|What's not to love!  Great story, wonderful animation, fabulous script (with humor the adults can relate to), and with the voices of Tom Hanks and Tim Allen this is a movie that will be enjoyed for generations.  Well Done Disney-Pixar!
B006LSZECO|5.0|Gillian Flynn has written a real page turner full of interesting characters...on of whom is so deceitfully psychotic, it's hard to even recognize it.  Flynn stays away from what could be a cliche story line and really brings you on a ride. A great read!
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This is a exciting fast paced game. You have to pay attention to the road and the tracks.Along the way you can collect coins and key to help with the game.
B00CXVX1OQ|4.0|Fun application, needs a few more moves like ducking & weaving. I like the ability to play it with others on your network.
B0018EO6R0|5.0|This is one of Nightwishes best albums, has a lot of great songs aside from the known singles. get it
B005J7K950|5.0|Pat Benatar, Freddie Mercury, Adam Ant, Bonnie Tyler, Billy Squier,and a host of others were asked by George Moroder to contribute to this classic 1926 silent film.The music is gorgeous. It transform this film into a whole new experience.<br />Watch this you won't be disapointed.
B005WLQQ4Q|5.0|My son loves this album and at such a great price.  I took him to meet these guys before for autographs and they are some really great, stand-up guys.
B000ID37KO|5.0|I'm only 32 and I enjoyed this film for the fact that there was no such thing as computer generated effects in 1962. In fact there were no computers. Disney contributed to the effects and it works. Nothing like an Alfred Hitchcock film.
0240815807|5.0|This book is full of very useful nuggets of information... For example, I always thought of Phase Cancellation as a bad thing... However, this book goes outside the box.... and talks about how you can use phase cancellation to your advantage... for techniques like &#34;Ducking&#34; and &#34;M/S&#34; processing... I would have never thought about using phase cancellation in that way... I can't wait to put these techniques into action on my next recordings... !<br /><br />Also, there is a section that talks about using distortion and parallel processing to add harmonics (that didn't originally exist) on instruments like the bass guitar... (which has always been a pain point for me... i.e. trying to EQ the bass so that it can be actually heard in the mix)
B001ANYDAO|3.0|Loved the concept but way, way, way too many anecdotal examples given. Good read, but skimmed a lot of the repetition.
B00CATSONE|2.0|I read the first few chapters which have nothing to do with Tesla. After skimming through the rest I deleted it.
B009RX7IX8|5.0|This is my must see show. From the writing to the acting to the behind the scenes crew, this show is the best. Drama, comedy, romance. I can't wait to see the bloopers and the deleted scenes and see which episodes have the commentary on the Season 5 DVD set!
B005U9QJY2|5.0|Jim Henson did an amazing job with The Dark Crystal! I am about to show my age but, I remember seeing it at the movies and the bad rat/buzzard looking guys with huge robes scared me. Especially, the one with high pitch moan and the old emperor. The story is kinda weak but, who cares....the beautiful puppetry is enough of a reason to watch it. A true classic!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazon has the 3 seasons of Downton Abby!  All of the shows stream great no interruptions.  I love my Amazon Prime
B00992CF6W|5.0|This is a great app and is faster than my computer. It is wonderful, but it does not have  night in creative and does not have the end or the nether<br />. But besides that it's great!
B00BTLOOAQ|5.0|I don't really have a favorite track yet I like the entire album.  I first listened to it on my subscription music service but this is one you have to own.
B008P1EWIM|5.0|I love this weather App, it is quick and easy to view the days weather. The backgrounds are beautiful and aesthetic I would recommend this App to everyone, and its a good price too.

B003L77G8I|5.0|What can I say? I love this show. The characters and scripts are well written and well defined. If you enjoyed the previous seasons of this show, there is no reason why you won't enjoy this one too.
B0063GORYU|5.0|Wish I could make the cards larger on the kindle but it is a great game.  I like the undo button so I can work on always completing the game.  Never get bored with it

B006RXSW5O|5.0|CLASSIC! One of the greatest films of the 90's! Defines the generation. A must for any film collection. MORE WORDS
B009AY04A8|1.0|It's Thought it might be appropriate for kids. Definitely not. So I didn't play it. The intro lost my attention.
1400095204|4.0|Great literature is a wonderful way to get a history lesson.  Especially when a book is as well-written as this one.  This book is about the short-lived history of Biafra. Biafra was an attempt by a small area in Nigeria to form their own country.  There were a lot of ethnic and cultural tensions in Nigeria in the mid-60's.  The tiny secessionist country was made up of mostly Igbo people, and the catalyst that really forced their hand to secede was a massacre of Igbo people by the Nigerians in 1966.  The tiny country of Biafra was formed.  The book covers this time frame as well as the entire Biafran war which ran from 1967 to 1970.  It is rather timely to read about a catastrophic civil war such as this one was.  There is so much civil unrest in the world today, and history has taught us that no one wins when countries take up arms against their own people.  The casualties are usually enormous and tensions run extremely high so it's like living on a powder keg.  Even those of us who live in relatively peaceful countries away from the maelstrom don't win.  The horrific stories and the atrocities reduce our capabilities of feeling compassion because civil unrest is so prevalent.  We think, \\"Oh, it's just another case of people fighting amongst themselves.\\"  This book utilizes a no-holds-barred approach to the Biafran war and we see the personal toll on the people who lived through it through the eyes of Ms. Adichie's characters.  So many people died in this three-year span.  Starvation was actually the cause of the most fatalities.  The suffering that these people went through is horrific, and to think it came from their own countrymen.  More than one million people died during this war.  Ms. Adichie's characters are wonderfully drawn.  The main three characters are an African university professor, his lady-love who comes from a priviliged Igbo family, and young thirteen year old Ugwu who is employed as houseboy by the professor.  It shows their life before the secession and their lives as they flee over and over again from the carnage.  It was a hard book to read because of the tragedy of this war, but there was hope here as well, portrayed so well by Ms. Adichie's wonderful characters.  This is a book that I'm glad that I read.  An important work that will be appreciated for many years I think.  Wonderful job.sion and their lives as they flee over and over again from the carnage.

B004XUMMFE|5.0|Be great to see it come back, won't happen, so enjoy this season. A nice representation of a number of genres, all meshing and giving the viewer a great experience.
B00910Y1OQ|5.0|I really enjoy this game. Has enough of a challenge to not be boring, but not enough to be frustrating.
B00364K6YW|5.0|I saw this mini series on A&E years ago.  I was completely captivated by the scenery and the cast.  It captures the sly wit of the book perfectly.  It was one of the first DVD movies I ever purchased.  It's long, but worth it if you love the book.  Be forewarned though, it will ruin every other movie version of Pride and Prejudice you see.
B00BFUUMO8|5.0|great game. build money makers like food spots and towers early to have a decent economy with a good time pace. don't commit. to evolving dinosaur without a lot of coin banked up
1558908382|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies.  I actually purchased this copy for a friend who had never seen it.  It's dark, witty humor that makes me laugh out loud every time I rewatch it.
B000FC0V3E|5.0|Don't know how I made it this long without having read Hemingway but I will continue.  This apparently is his first novel and his writing style is unusual to say the least.  He can describe something with no adjectives and yet paint the most vivid picture. He also went from almost agonizingly brief sentences to over- the- top descriptions, i.e. bull fights, Spanish landscapes.  I highly recommend it.
B005723JSQ|5.0|Sophie kinsella has been a favorite of mine for years. Glad she's come out with more humorous characters. Good read.

1250007208|5.0|I check out this book from the library and well had to return it even though I didn't want to. I don't think I can express just how much I am loving the Lunar Chronicles.  Cinder is just the first book in a 4 book series. I also had the pleasure of reading the second book  in the series, Scarlet. The last two books {Crest & Winter} however are still not out, but I will be running to read those as soon as they are released.<br /><br />Cinder is supposed to be a retelling of Cinderella in a futuristic New Beijing. Don't let that fool you though, this retelling of Cinderella is a story all it's own. The Lunar Chronicles ties in all the books and their heroines so even though Cinder's story is all Cinderella-esque her story is so much more than marrying a prince and living happily ever after. Which might I add is not how this book ends. Marissa Meyer does a beautiful job of telling this story. There is a lot of things going wrong in poor Cinder's life but she proves to be a strong and resilient young woman. Her evil step mother is the worse and one of her step sister's is equally as bad. Her second step sister turns out to be a sweetheart who adores Cinder as much as Cinder loves her. She also has a trusty android sidekick who you can't help but fall in love with, think one of Cinderella's mice only more opinionated and cool.<br /><br />In the midst of it all is a deathly plague and an evil lunar queen wanting to run the country of New Beijing. If you didn't guess it already from the cover Cinder is cyborg, which makes her part human part robot. She also happens to be a great mechanic which is how she ends of meeting the dreamy Kai. Did I mention he is the Emperor's son? A totally hottie with a title but there is more to this story than his dreamy good looks. He comes to Cinder for some help and well that's when the story really begins. For the sake of maintaining spoiler free I will just tell you that this book is full of surprises.<br /><br />While there is a thing ortwo you will figure out a long the way, it is not so bad that you would say the book was predictable. In fact, even though I kind of knew where the book was headed with a plot point or two, I found myself very please with being right. Marissa Meyer is a great writer and I would be honored to own any of her books. In fact I am definitely placing these babies on my Christmas list. If you are into Sci-fi with just a little romance and a lot of action this is the book for you. It is a young adult novel so the story is much more pure and unclouded with sex where I think many adult novels tend to go wrong. At the end of Cinder you might just have shed a tear or two but it would have all been worth it.<br /><br />I don't think I can put into words just how much I loved this book, even though as a write this is kind of a requirement. I do recommend it wholeheartedly to anyone who is looking for something a little bit different to read. At the end of this book you just are left in a whirlwind of emotion and I guarantee your won't wait a minute before running out to get Scarlet. So if you're thinking of  checking Cinder out of the library or buying it, I recommend you also get Scarlet. I will be working on the review for Scarlet next, just so you can get an idea of how amazing this series is.<br /><br />I cross posted this review from my blog. It can be found here:<br />[...]
B002MCJZHS|5.0|I think most people are familiar with The xx's song, &#34;Intro.&#34; I liked the song quite a bit and I decided I wanted to check out the entire album. I was not disappointed!
B009WUAK2M|5.0|The comedy aspect wasn't over the top. Chuck Norris coming out of the smoke wearing dark glasses was an instant classic spot.<br />Easily recognizable sequences to several other good action flicks was a nice way of honoring them.<br />Jean-Claude Van Damme did a great job as a real bad guy.<br />Looking forward to  seeing this again and again.
0525478817|4.0|I'll start by saying that this is not John Green's best work even though it's his best selling work. Paper Towns is still by far my most loved Green novel and for good reason. This book, being just over 300 pages, was a fairly quick read since it only took me a little under two days to finish. That right there is testament that this book was NOT boring like some other reviewers mentioned. I'm trying to stick away from plot in this review so if you're looking for a synopsis please look elsewhere, this is more like a reflection back on the book. *SPOILERS AHEAD, READERS BEWARE* From the start, I expected Hazel to die. I banked on it. I would have bet money on it. Once we find out how An Imperial Affliction ended, I was positive TFiOS would end in the exact same way. Even after Augustus died, I still thought the book would end like that. Being a Cancer book, I was expecting either a happy, miracle ending, or something totally morbid and the fact that we got neither of that kind of upset me. I cried a couple times throughout the story but not once after Gus died. The ending lacked impact. The characters were as rounded out as YA characters generally go. The book was good. I even caught some Paper Towns references; about how you perceive a person actually describes you. If I ever find myself bored and bookless, and have already read my favorites shelf a couple of times through, I would pick this up again, much faster than I'd pick up, say, An Abundance of Kathrines. If you're a John Green fan, read this. If you're just looking for a new book to read, get Paper Towns, then read this.
B007REV4T8|5.0|This is all I can say. Love the movie. Love the action. Love Daniel! Good DVD. This Bond is coming close to Sean Connery. If the first movies of Bond were more action they would be great. I realize it was the time. The products were better in the first movies. We need to see better gadgets.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|I think that this app is really awesome!  I love it.  It is a lot like taking care of a real horse!  I really recommend getting it!
B005K17RU0|5.0|A fine source for immediate weather updates without the hassle of commercials and other hoopla you get on television and radio.  A fine resource.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This is a very well written novel that keeps you interested and invested In the lives of the characters. I definitely cried, more than once.
B00CUWWLWG|4.0|Great game, did not see the movie but if it is half as fun as the game it must have been EPIC
B000VK99Z6|5.0|A must see if you're a fan of Shawn of the dead. This continues the thread of jokes that will be completed by the world's end.
B007IXWKUK|3.0|A little bit different take on the first one but over all an easy transition from the first to the last. A happy middle between the two.
B0058VW36U|1.0|This game does not work at all. This is the first time this has ever happened to me with an amazon app. Its not worth the wasted time to download. The thing totally froze.
B007J4T2G8|3.0|Not the best and not the worst I've read. James let the kink fly in this series but over all there are more well written 'Romance&#34; novels.
B00AA0U05A|5.0|I've only known Emmy Rossum as an actress. I saw her on a talk show talking about her CD and she sang a song. I love old songs and purchased this CD. I really enjoy it.
B001NLKZUA|5.0|This book picks up where City of Bones left off and pulls you in further into this world of Angles and Demons. Questions are both answered and raised in the second novel of Mortal Instruments.
B00AO2P3GA|5.0|This game is great!!! You guys gotta try it!!! I love this game. Reminds me of call of duty 4 and MW2
0307891372|5.0|The perfect companion to the Skyrim video game. I think that over all it offers most if not all the things you need in order to complete the game. I wish it had the DLC information but rarely does that happen with guides.
B009AMANBA|5.0|If you like anything to do with the Civil War, this movie is for you. It really brings it back for you. Better than in school
B002ITWSUQ|5.0|I absolutely LOVED this movie. I'm a big Christina Ricci fan and loved every bit of this movie. I hope to get it on BluRay soon.
B005LAIHSG|5.0|It had a lot of special effects, and the story played out really well. The ending was the best ever
B007IXWL2C|3.0|A lot less sex in this one but I enjoyed the twist and the way the ending played out between Anna and Christian.
B008QE9XD2|5.0|This movie is one of the best films he has done. It was funny and well played, all the actors were good.
0425263924|5.0|This is a great book. I could not put it down. It was just a good if not better than the other two.
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|This is a fun, entertaining hidden picture/puzzle game. The in-app purchases aren't required to advance as other reviewers have stated.
B009R659L8|4.0|Wonderful story teller. Like everything she writes<br />Good story little love plenty mystery keeps you going<br />Liked it a lot
B00004SVIK|5.0|A masterpiece<br /><br />I don't use this word very often.<br /><br />This disc set could be the best live recording I have ever heard.<br />Pristine sound and stellar performance of this Pink Floyd classic. (Important as well because it was Rick Wright's last tour with the band.)<br /><br />The packaging is probably the best I have ever seen as well. It even feels good to hold in your hands !<br /><br />I gave it five stars because that was all I was allowed to give.
B000WMFZMY|4.0|I'm old enough to remember when El Cid was first released. At that time Bronston had 2 major movies in distribution simultaneously: \\"King of Kings\\" and \\"El Cid\\".  For some reason I clearly remember the newspaper reviews of the two movies - almost verbatim. Something like this - \\"King of Kings; a crumb of a film about a pyramid of a man.  El Cid; a pyramid of a film about a crumb of a man.\\"<br />El Cid is a series of \\"spectacular\\" scenes, held together by a loose plot and a love interest. The reason the word \\"spectacular\\" is in quotes is because statistically they meet the requirements of spectacle, having the requisite no. of extras milling around, fighting each other, cheering, or each waving one regulation Bronston cabbage to show how much they love El Cid for giving them food. Bronston desperately wanted to thrill his audiences, and he always does (or did) come up with some thrilling moments.  But like Wagnerian opera, the thrills are short lived, and quickly decay into schmaltz or tedium.  He was terrific on opening shots. He (and Anthony Mann) would choose just the right light and just the right angles for the sweeping Technirama 70 format, and produce images that stirred the soul. The voiceover narration - quiet and dignified - would set the scene in broad Homeric blank verse (\\"... and there came a time when Ben Yussuf and his men ...\\") Miklos Rozsa would pump it up with a few \\"look out here it comes\\" opening bars ... and then ... then it all fell apart when the actors opened their mouths and spoke their cliched lines that sounded like they'd been taken from an end-of-term grade-school production.<br />Actually I could never understand why Bronston was so taken with Miklos Rozsa.  His scores are cloying and unimaginative.  Presumably his name on the credits was money in the bank.  If you turn off the picture and just listen to the music you have no idea if you're watching Quo Vadis, Ben Hur, or King of Kings. They are completely interchangeable.  He did manageto infuse the El Cid score with some Spanish and Moorish themes, but believe me, he is no Georges Bizet. They still sound like loud Rozsa schlock.  Dimitri Tiomkin would have been a far better choice.<br />Despite all my negativity I have a great sentimental attachment for El Cid, just because it is unique and outrageous, and because Bronston was such a character;  the nephew of Leon Trotsky, no less.  Far better men than I, including Marty Scorcese have professed their love for this flawed gem.<br /><br />D. Best.

0425263916|2.0|It was good.  Not too involved and you can follow the happening fairly easy.<br />Will get her other book also.
B0013TXA5Y|2.0|I really wanted this book to be good and fun to read...but it just didn't happen. I struggled with the writers style and thought the book was poorly written overall.  The fight scenes lack luster and many of the small story lines unfinished and not thought out. I will not be reading anymore of these books unless they are forced upon me. Major let down.<br />  Refund anyone?
B002PEP4SC|4.0|Just a good read and a great story like watching a Castle episode in my imagination.  Big fan of the series this was like an episode I haven't seen. Couldn't put it down. Thanks
B00CSR2J9I|5.0|Fun game to play. It gets addictive very quickly.  The tracks are challenging but the points add up quickly for vehicle upgrades and different scenes.
B006JPS1OM|2.0|But unfortunately when I got to chapter 9 it locked up and I can't go any further! I've tried numerous times and even restarted my kindle Fire to no avail. This is the first G5 game that I've had problems with so it's very disappointing. From now on guess I'll pay more attention to the reviews and not purchase those that are said to lock up. Guess I'll delete it and try it from the beginning again at a later date when I've forgotten it so it'll seem like a new game....  :-(
0763644765|5.0|Once again, Leslie has the perfect words to fit the title of the book and is fun to read. The artwork is cute.
B00B2V66VS|3.0|It is a great app and it was free.  It is addictive but I feel like I am literally running in circles with hardly any change in scenery.

B00DW5IM9Q|5.0|Listening to Self-Portrait on vinyl this morning as I write this review.  Self-Portrait is a lovely double album and it always takes me back to the summer of 1970 when I first bought it and played it a lot.  The 2 CD set Another Self-Portrait has some great outtakes, orphan tracks and gems .  If you're a Dylan fan you won't be disappointed.

B007ZGO7EM|4.0|The calculator plus was a great find for me because I always need a handy calculator when I can't find one. Which is a lot of the time. I liked how easy it is to use. The only thing that would make it better is if it was a scientific calculator. I guess we can't be too picky for something that is free. I would recommend this to anyone who is in school or just needs a handy calculator.
B000687M48|5.0|Awesome CD/DVD I'm a fan and i was missing this cd and don't disappointed recorder in Paris the music sound so good, if your are a fan buy it is most for you collection.
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great plot twists; hard as steel characters show vulnerabilities;  Good mix of beautiful (but smart people) and the ordinary looking Joes who are all rich as an ice cream sundae.  Fun to watch as a marathon and keep the continuity going.
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Nice and interesting but it would be better if you could keep playing without having to either pay it wait to get more crystals.  Still, it is fun and worth playing.
B00AVFO41K|5.0|I love this game.  It's addicting.  You don't want it to end. Getting 5 colors in a row sounds easy but when you move 1 color more colors pop up & may pop up in your row so you have to move that one & put the color you want in the row.  there are wild colors & arrows on some colors that are pointed up/down/across that when the row is complete the arrow shouts off in that direction & removes all colors in that row.  You won't be disappointed with this.
B00AREIAI8|5.0|This game is very fun and easy to play.The best part is that the whole game is free and there are no ads.
B003K15IF8|5.0|Stoner's author John Williams writes a luminous, moving novel that shows his characters with tenderness, ruthless honesty, so as a reader, one cannot help but identify with them. The novel was absolutely riveting, beautifully told with immense feeling.
B008QLXSG8|5.0|I bought this kindle book for my daughter and she is the one who is going to read it! I cannot rate it!
B00DQBWLSO|2.0|I listened to this album three times before coming to the conclusion that I don't care for it.  I own all of Mayer's previous studio albums and enjoyed the musical variety and style change present in each album.  In contrast, there wasn't a single hook on this album for me and nothing grew on me after several listens.<br /><br />This album seems a bit amateur and lazy to me.  It's primarily light-hearted folk music that lacks any kind of emotional depth or variety of sound.  Whereas previous albums had a wide range of backup singers and multiple musical instruments with depth in musical sound and fullness, this album is primarily focused on just acoustic guitar instruments and light drum accompaniment with Mayer as the dominant singer.  Its overall \\"sound\\" is the same from the first to the last track.<br /><br />It's definitely not the quality Mayer is capable of...even when there is plenty of allowance granted him for developing a different style.  You might want to borrow this album before purchasing your own copy.
B008673ZAQ|5.0|Love the series!!! Read them all twice. Can't wait for book 4.  Eva & Gideon are my new favorite couple.

B00DHSK3RM|1.0|There are only some levels here and they were of no help whatsoever. I don't have trouble with the few levels they have hints for, its several others that stump me....or keep me from progressing.

B001QWBM62|5.0|I bought the Zoom ZH4N recorder to record audio from external microphones to get better sound out of my Nikon D7000 DSLR camera. The onboard mic is awful, of course, and I wanted to be able to have a boom and/or lav mics all recording along with the camera's built-in audio. I setup the Zoom as a boom mic, and hook up to two lav mics into it. I end up with several tracks of audio, along with the built-in audio from the camera.<br /><br />I use Plural Eyes software to sync the audio, which does it in seconds. It's so easy it's scary. The Zoom records great quality, and has a ton of features I haven't even used yet. I've had it for over a year and haven't even scratched the surface of its features. Great little recorder with big, professional quality audio.

B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Very easy set up using IPad even before the (useless) chromecast app became avilable.<br />YouTube casting works great.<br />Netflix casting works great<br />Chrome, with extension, casting works from Mac and PC<br />No extension yet available for Chrome on IPad or Android so no casting from browser for IPad or android phone. I don't know if there is a good technical reason for this continuing omission.
B00ESY7QXI|4.0|This latest effort to bring F. Scott Fitzgerald's words to the big screen succeeded well enough. We are introduced to the narrator, Nick Carraway (played by Tobey Maguire), as having been committed to a sanitarium for alcoholics. His doctor asks him to put to paper his thoughts, as a form of therapy. As he writes, the words seemingly come to life and the story of his friend Gatsby unfolds. The movie resembles the director's other flashy spectacle, Moulin Rouge, using many of the same tracking crowd shots and crotch shots. Almost all of the film's scenery appears to be CGI, save for the close up interior shots. It seemed to have an animation quality to it that I found unsettling. Thankfully the acting was good, especially the part of Daisy played by Carey Mulligan, and the small part of Myrtle the mistress played by the capable Isla Fisher. Rounding out the ensemble is relative newcomer Elizabeth Debicki who just killed it as Daisy's gal pal, professional golfer Jordan Baker. Of course who would argue that Leo DiCaprio didn't make a great Gatsby. As one of my literary friends said \\"Who else could play a super rich guy better than a super rich actor?\\" To which I replied \\"A good actor can play rich or poor, regardless of their own wealth or upbringing.\\" It's interesting because Leo has played all levels of the social strata. And while some might say he was the perfect choice to play Gatsby, I tend to disagree. Yes, Gatsby was a poor boy who made it big, but his conspicuous consumption lifestyle was a means to an end. His huge parties, poppin' bottles & touchin' models, was all for the sole purpose of getting Daisy to come back into his life, now that he had made it. I felt that DiCaprio attempted to convey this desperate longing and hopefullness but it didn't quite strike me as convincing. Suave and debonair as he is, I don't think he is (even acting) as suave and debonair as the character of Jay Gatsby. Otherwise this is a very good movie and has a good soundtrack too.
B007ZXK08C|5.0|The author starts off slowly, and almost mundanely, with a narrator reading from her diary. Before you are even aware of it, you find yourself being drawn into a black hole of totally unexpected twists and turns, growing darker and more menacing throughout, until you realize it's a thriller you're reading, and you have no idea where it's going. You only know you must find out, and so you can't put the book down.<br /><br />Fabulous writing; author has total control of her subject matter and language (the intricate and complicated plot she contrived plot is dazzling).<br /><br />Only reservation is that I felt the ending was disappointing, didn't work for me at all. It just didn't follow, not logical. Still, totally worth reading.

B005KXU83G|1.0|Short and Sweet. I own an original copy of the LP, on which the final track, \\"Let It Rock\\", runs over 10 minutes, it is a Seger encore mainstay. When it was first published on CD the song was editted down to 6+ minutes, with a horribley noticable edit. Now, would you think all these years later when they are going to put out a 'REMASTERED EDITION', in a digital format, they could at least include a copy of the original version of the song. Nope, still the same crappy CD Version. I still have the album, I was hoping I wouldn't have to digitize it. This was one of the 5.00 albums. I should have checked first. Very very dissappointed
