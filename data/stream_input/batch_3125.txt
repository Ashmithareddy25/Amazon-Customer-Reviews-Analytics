B00B4804MQ|5.0|The fourth movie of the Fast and Furious movie is perhaps the best one since the its debut. The story sporadically connects back to that from the first movie. Fast & Furious evolves to an all-time law and crime movie much more violent compare with its predecessors besides the first movie.
B007RQ6WCA|1.0|don't use if your a novice...found it to be difficult and I switched to cloud and things got a whole lot easier
B00319ECGK|5.0|The Matrix set my mind free and showed me that &#34;reality&#34; is based on perception.  I like Trinity, cause she is an alpha female, and those types of women always intrigue me.  Strong and hard, as well as soft and feminine at the same  time!  A conundrum.  Great story line that makes you think!
B0081336FO|5.0|want more of the series...follows the books in a modern era very well...bring it back to TV and very soon
B004ZJZQ5G|5.0|Of course the blue-ray resolution and sound make this an excellent visual/auditory experience.  But I like the story line, and especially the cast.  They bring a particular time period to life before your very eyes, and the sexual tension and passion between the two main characters is &#34;inspiring&#34;!
B007W4OZ76|1.0|i started using cloud with amazon and it works a WHOLE lot simpler for my Kindle HD..if your a novice don't use it
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|LOVE this game! The app works as quickly & as well as the one on my iPad Mini. I was super excited to see that it was finally available on the Kindle.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I'd give it give stars if it had been rated R and head shots were shown. After all, this is the zombie apocolypse.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|This is the best series.  We watch a couple of episodes every night and are addicted!!!  Can't wait to get the 3rd season.
B004BC7MRM|2.0|I am a huge Kid Rock fan. Loved his last three albums a lot but I feel the songwriting really is diminished on this album with the exception of the title track(only song I really like on the album). Hope he goes back too his previous songwriting ways.
0307720748|5.0|As cliche as it sounds this book grabs you and keeps you at the edge of your seat from the first page. I highly recommend it for anyone interested in success, business, or just biographies in general. This biography is exciting, funny, and never fails to keep you entertained. Plus it gives you a detailed history of Virgin from its original conception until now. Branson's boat and balloon expeditions will make you wonder if he will make it to the end of the book. This book will make you want to go out and live life to the fullest and chase your dreams no matter how crazy they are.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|The book kept my interest and I did not want to put it down until I finished.  Grisham hit a home run with this one.  I think his best.  Love the characters...certainly enough open ended story lines to have another book with Jake and the Ford County citizens.
B001NHN7TU|5.0|Great classic movie I loved when I was a kid and I just watched it with my 10 year old and he loved it too!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I know everyone was really disappointed in this book, and to be completely honest I was a little bit too. It seemed like the themes and story lines were very similar to Insurgent, and while the last two books I devoured, this was a bit more difficult to get through. And then when you get through it to the ending, I legitimately wanted to find Veronica Roth and scream at her. I just want to know how after wwe all invested all this time and energy into these books, she decideded ending it the way she did was ok. I mean if you read the other two you have to read this one, I'm just really hoping they change the ending to the movie adaption of this, and keep Ms. Roth as far away from production as they can.
B00D8CSVLW|4.0|Great story line as usual... but gets a little too enamoured of legal procedure at times.  But  a great read , nonetheless...
B0053TMP24|5.0|Great book you should get it great for 12-15 year olds. If u like war get this book. Percy is Bomb
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Very well written.  The characters were real and believable. It held my interest from the first page to the last.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Great movie.  I am an old Star Trek fan dating back to the original TV series.  The camaraderie between characters in the orignal series is what made it great.  And here we have the same chemistry occuring with the new crop of actors playing the same roles.  A great movie.  I look forward to more in the series.
B00F7YHDWC|5.0|This game is so entertaining. It's funny, employs different skills and makes others want to play it to see why you're having such a good time.
B00A85EMVK|5.0|great movie, and excellent packaging, shipping. I would recommend to anybody else to buy a great movie. You feel like you are in the Tomcat. Great thrill
B001NLKZUA|4.0|Intriguing ... Fun... Romantic....a griping page turner for all ages. A world of  demons underworlders and shadow hunters amongst the human race
B0000026ND|5.0|Pink Floyd truly belong in a class all of their own.  This Live album from their Momentary Lapse of Reason tour Introduces the band to a new Generation of fans and reaffirms their stature for the faithful. Sure the Critics hated it but who are they? From the cool artwork to the impeccable playing This show would have been great(yes I know the performances are from several different dates) But hearing Learning to Fly, Sorrow, On the Turning Away and Money all in one setting is simply too cool to pass up. The Cassette and CD Version have one track not available on Vinyl and Different Sequences but all and all it's a great set. The sound is very good by the way as well.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Does it all work out how I wanted? No. Is it more realistic because it didn't? Yes. Did I enjoy it? Yes.<br /><br />I'm not going to say I loved this book, but that doesn't mean it was bad. It just means that sometimes a story and an author  have a different vision if how things play out than I do. Guess what though, that's why I read books by others. You get to see and hear their story the way they see it in the world they created. The book was interesting, emotional, and made me keep reading. All appropriate things for a good book to be. The book did seem a little less strong to me character wise, but honestly it gave me the impression that the characters were just tired and worn thin by their experiences. I know I would be in their situation. Does this book make me want to see the movies? Nope, not really now that I know how it ends, but lucky for me I have that choice. Maybe I'll just see the first two.
B00000I2PG|5.0|Simply an all around great New Romantic/New Wave album. ABC's Debut was like a Night on the Town for anyone who has been there or dreamed of their first all night run around. Clever Production From Trevor Horn and arguably the best set of Songs the group would ever produce make this album the standout of the Groups career. The Look Of Love and Poison Arrow were the U.S. Radio hits but Show Me, All of My Heart and Tears Are not Enough could have been big as well. They would knock their audience for a loop with their next release (Beauty Stab) and their 80's catalog is worth exploring, but to Truly appreciate the group you must first check out this release. Get It.
B000OYC7A8|5.0|I bought this to give to someone for their Christmas gift, I have it myself and love it so had no hesitation purchasing one for a friend.
B00F8GYC1Y|1.0|Save your money guys the free version is exactly the same and I should no because I completely completed each disappointed. So take my advice before u buy this
B00AF6MF9I|4.0|I like this game.  I could play for hours each and every day.  pretty challenging to defeat other top players.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is very challenging and is fun. I think everyone will get  additive to this game.  I tell all my friends about it.  I play it as much as I can
B00E8KLWB4|4.0|Fun game. Lots of challenges to beat so you can keep playing but not do the same thing over and over
B00CWY76CC|5.0|This game keeps busy and thinking, I could play for hours. I wish it would update a little more.that would be great
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Kept my attention, love the suspense, as it I did not guess what was really going on, Great follow up to a Time to Kill. Must read
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|I'm hooked!~  Got addicted after my son told me about it....Hey, what happened to 'Orange is the New Black?' I wanted to watch it after the ending I saw!
B003ODIZL6|1.0|It takes to long. It shouldn't be like an old-fashioned dictionary. It would be easier if we could type the word it it shows us choices. But that what I think. Please give a threat thumbs up. If you agree.
B0036BK6MW|5.0|One of the best movies ever--and ok for kids to watch! No cussing or weapons but many lessons to learn--respect, kindness, the importance of the family unit and an education--too many to list here. I've read that the depiction of the real Michael isn't accurate, but that does not take away from this film. I bought two copies and gave one to my best friend.<br />Camera shots in this movie are excellent--I can see why Sandra Bullock won an Oscar. I also bought the Tuohys' book &#34;In a Heartbeat&#34;, which gave addition movie info.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|I thought it was a great movie. It did a good job of making Clark more of a real person. He wasn't just some empty shell that always does the awesome thing. There was a real depth to the character and a little darkness, which was a refreshing view.
B008JFUN50|1.0|When the director of this film brought out District 9 a few years ago, I was quite enthusiastic. An imaginative, meaningful, powerful story filmed in new ways.<br />Now he gives us a crude, simplistic, violent and essentially boring scifi story. Main themes are a class struggle in space, not exactly original, and some kind of Affordable Care simplification.<br /><br />What a let down. Jody Foster in possibly her stupidest role ever. Matt Damon as a non actor, impersonating an action hero, or some kind of high tech Mad Max, with a substantial lack of madness. The only similarity to District 9 is the seediness of the earthly environment, as opposed to the Elysium, the residential planet for the better class people.<br />I have tried to find a reason to give more than one star, but couldn't find one.
B00G9U7NEQ|4.0|Very cute movie my kids loved it .....over and over and over again lol ! Love the ease of amazon rentals.
B004EWFV9K|5.0|The story is riveting but near the end of the book it froze my Kindle so now I don't know how it ends.  Will have to buy the hard copy to find out or get a new Kindle.  An older person can identify with some of the angst one sometimes feels like Kurt Wallender does all through the book.
B00B0LPYXG|5.0|The best movie I have ever seen.  I don't think any other movie has touched me like this one did.
B00DVPN0W6|5.0|great songs, great recording.  Amos at his best.  I especially like Johnson Blvd.  Chill in the air and Mountains of Sorry
0385504225|4.0|Dan Brown will have difficulty topping his first great mystery, The Da Vinci Code. The Lost Symbol falls short of that high mark but is still an intriguing and engaging book. There are so many myths about the Masons and the Masonic Lodge. Mr. Brown has used a goodly number of them in this book. It's a fast paced read and very enjoyable.
B005I6EVUG|5.0|Very pretty!  I love it.  It protects my Kindle Paperwhite perfectly.  The pocket puts less stress on my hand.  Would Reccomend!
B0043UB0EI|5.0|Amazing show. I loved it.  I have no idea how historically accurate it is but it's well worth watching.  Not for the squeamish or children.
1781162646|4.0|Not one of his best stories and I'm an avid fan of his work.  It was just ok for me.
1878424319|5.0|This is an excellent book and is very easy to read.  It is too the point and the message is clear.  I recommend it to anyone who is looking for personal growth and ways to live a happy and fulfilling life.
B00BJ9VBLI|3.0|I am still playing it, had to download the full version before I could continue.  The trial version got your desire to continue playing.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|If you love drama and British people, you'll love Downton Abbey. Also, it's an interesting time in history not often covered in movies and television.
B00F9A903O|5.0|Good game,  only thing I  would like is to have the feed mill work a little faster. I have a habit of forgetting that I<br />need to  make feed.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|One of the best books in the Divergent series. I really enjoyed them (which surprised me at first) and looking forward to the movie!
B0071XO8RA|5.0|Great description of a different world, strong well developed characters and a very well tangled story keep you wanting to read all night.  I can't wait to read the follow up!
B00AVTMCYW|5.0|I never read the book but since the author adapted and directed the movie I have to imagine it's true to the novel. Great music supervision. Great cast of young actors. Only objection is that Hermione wanted to go to to Penn State.
B005721W9O|4.0|I watched this on a recommendation from a friend and was pleasantly surprised and really enjoyed it!  The cast worked very well together and the story was great with a few &#34;I didn't expect that&#34; moments for sure.  This works as a comedy but even more so as a good SF movie.  The writing is great and very well played.  It's not often you get a comedy that also involves space travel, aliens, and Tim Allen.  For real though, this is a pretty fun movie and well deserved of 4 stars, check it out!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully written. Mostly believable dialogue as compared to other YA novels. Between this movie adaptation and Divergent, Shailene Woodley is going to be inescapable.<br /><br />And worth re-reading even if you know how it's going to end and how you're going to react.
B009IA3O2O|5.0|I am quite shocked/impressed with the Silverthorn album. I am a die-hard Roy Khan fan and was very hesitant to give Kamelot a shot after he left the band. I'm glad I decided to listen. Tommy is not Roy, but Tommy is extremely talented and has such a beautiful voice that is actually quite reminiscent of Roy.<br />Annette proved that Nightwish could still rock after Tarja, and Tommy is proving the same for Kamelot. I will always adore Roy Khan and feel a loyalty to him, but I must also give credit where it is due... Kamelot still rocks and Tommy does an amazing job filling those shoes.
B0052UZIFA|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B0099G7KDQ|5.0|Already heard lots of Mumford and Sons, but finally took the plunge to purchase.  Very much enjoying my new music.
B004SKHJF2|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B001ILFUDC|5.0|I was first thrown off by receiving this without the seal over the top like all Disney movies, however, it was shrink wrapped. I emailed the seller and they were very awesome in responding quickly. I ultimately did not return this movie since it played well and was obviously new. Price was wonderful and the seller was also amazing in customer service. I gave them a 5 star for wonderful product and wonderful customer service.
B00F880BWG|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great show! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a watch.
B005POK858|5.0|Fun little RPG that reminds me of the Nintendo and early PS years.  It's great to have a game like this on the go, it has helped me get through many plane flights (on original Kindle Fire).  I enjoy the storyline, and game mechanics.  I wish there were more mobile games like this one, without having to pay $20.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I love the divergent series!!!! I can't wait till the movies come out!!!! This last book gets confusing with the tris tobais chapters.
B004SBS8LA|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B004ZG5F28|5.0|One of my favorite movies of all time. A modern day Pride and Prejudice, it is absolutely entertaining and Bridget is a real woman with problems most of us ladies can relate too. Too bad they made a terrible sequel. Don't watch it!
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Great device streams my browser and phone with no lag in hd.  Recommended to anyone who watches movies on his computer and wants to watch it on his TV without the hassle of wires
B004MNO0BQ|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B00FAPF5U0|2.0|It is impossible to proceed past level 23 without buying anything.  You shouldn't HAVE to buy stuff to proceed in the game.  It would also help if there were directions available showing how to get the special candies and what exactly each one does.
B002HJ9PTO|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great product! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a chance.
B004H4XDBI|5.0|I loved it!..perfect way to pick up were the first book left off and a perfect way to end it.
B004ZH66XO|5.0|This is such an awesome and really great app! I love it! Definitely worth it to give it a download.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Pretty cool game. I like the scenery most of all. It can be a bit challenging, but I do like the mindless parts, too.
B004MC8CA2|5.0|Love having the Bible with me everywhere and in multiple versions for comparison.  Enjoy the audio Bible feature very much!!
B00AESN8XY|5.0|My kids love it. But the in app purchases can really add up and become expensive. Watch your spending on this game was
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Damn game. I need Candy Crush Anonymous.<br />I am.... and I'm addicted to Candy Crush.<br />Step 1 - complete!<br /><br />Need more words... blahh blahh blahh
B00ECU2RGY|3.0|Could have been released as a 3 part mini-series on TV. Tediously long and tiresome.  Some trailers make it out to be more than it was.  Gorgeous landscapes and futuristic hardware can't fill a movie without enough meat.  If I had to do it all over, I would have waited for this title to be available on Netflix.
B00G32QIEG|4.0|Very funny, loved the concept and the characters.  Did not keep me in stitches but was very funny through out the movie.  The cast was great
B00CHIMG6Y|3.0|Very emotional movie that will bring a tear or two.  Not one of those movies that someone would have to run out to the theater and watch.  Worth the money when sitting at home laying down.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|This app worked perfectly at first then, a black square started covering the videos, the videos stopped working. This app claims to be all that, at first you fall head over heels with it but after that span of five days this app starts not working. I will download this app once again (maybe) when they start to fix all the problems it has! DO NOT RECOMMEND FOR ANYONE WHO WANTS AN ENJOYABLE EXPERIENCE!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The other two books were much better. I read it as soon as it came out but waited to post a review until now...mainly to avoid yelling at the author on this one ;-) lol  This book she switches between two characters but the problem I had was there weren't enough differences in the way they spoke to really remember who you were with. Many times I went back to the beginning of the chapter to remember whose perspective I was reading. Sometimes it's really obvious, but it should be much easier to figure out between a guy's thoughts and a girl's thoughts and it wasn't. The supporting characters weren't really developed more in this book either and it felt like Four was just a scared little boy who didn't have enough love in his life instead of the strong Four we all grew to love. At least Tris stays true to her character, but there was no need in the way some things played out for her either...NO NEED at ALL...I will not read another series by Roth until her last book is written and I see what people are rating it!
B000JPRPAO|2.0|When I saw the star-studded list of actors, I thought I was going to witness the best movie of 2003. Instead what I saw was probably one of the worst movies of the decade.
B00AAI7B7W|1.0|Since the movie came out, I have never been able to get past a certain point. And now 40 years later I still can not watch this movie. When you make money from exploiting satan's work there will never be any rewards in doing so. This movie should have never been released and certainly a 14 year old actress should never been allowed to start her career with it. They say that when she was in just her make-up and with a blue screen behind her and nothing happening at all, Linda Blair just standing there, that many of the cast members and staff were visibly shaken and had to leave the room. What does this tell you?
B003YK42M0|5.0|Amazing quality vinyl.<br /><br />This album also speaks a lot of what it means to be men, and the bonds that are created through life and experience.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|As usual Steven King did a fantastic job!!! I have always loved his stories! Can't get enough. My only complaint is that I have to wait for him to write qanother book.
B0038NN3B4|4.0|Has an updated &#34;do's and don'ts&#34; perspective; provides good information for someone new to Atkins, and for someone like me who is returning to it.  I found it useful to help me refine my knowledge of a low carb eating approach, and was the resource I needed to get started (again).
B00FPX54DA|5.0|Fabulous!!  Discovered the Piano Guys when flying home from Europe in September, and listened to them all the way back to the states!  Love it!!
B00ESB75FA|1.0|This show is losing its charm. After 8 seasons, the fans deserve more than this. Not only have they stretched this wedding weekend out for the entire season--they never showed the wedding or how Ted met his wife. The show is not nearly as funny as before, the content was boring and meaningless, and  I don't even like Lilly anymore. This was a waste of time and money. My opinion would be to save your money and wait for later episodes--you won't miss a thing.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great book, entertaining and fast! This was a very easy read, that kept me wanting to know what was going to happen next.
B00G8P2B4E|1.0|video stops every 10 seconds, and sometimes locks up and shuts off TV. All other videos work fine, ao it has to be a software problem. Gimme my money back.
B00B7FXZQS|3.0|It was entertaining but not as good as the first three.  Quite a bit of the story line didn't make sense and the weird kid was annoying but maybe he was suppose to be.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|Great teaching aid. My wife teaches Spanish and it impressed her as well.  Highly recommended to any beginner that wants an easy and fast way to learn a language.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I love this trilogy! My only complaint with this book was the format of breaking down the chapters by character. I haven't finished it yet but it is a page turner!
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|Just loaded this yesterday.  So far so good.  Cleaned a bunch of MB's worth.  No problems, and seems pretty stable of an app.
B002NNA9N0|5.0|5 star actors deliver a powerful portrayal of classic real world sales situations characterizing human nature in an entertaining and ultimately sad depiction of eat or be eaten.  ABC... Always Be Closing!
B00CH26TL8|3.0|It is a second rate game! There is no action and all you do is pop bubbles all day long. Unfortunately, it is very addicting .
B0000004F9|5.0|part of my youth. love it. very glad I could buy a digital replacement of my old stuff price is OK
B004S5C43E|5.0|If you are interested in climbing and find the Mallory story compelling then this is a good yarn. it is a very easy read especially when on holidays.
B00902AKK4|3.0|OK to play, but gets frustrating when you get to the end and the box and tunnel don't line up.  Sort of boring to have to go back several times to try and figure it out.
B009YN2M7S|5.0|This book is amazing!!!! Don't waste your time to watch the movie it sucked just read this over and over again!!!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Fun to try and get everything done within the amount of moves given.  Love the action and the &#34;sweet, delicious&#34; voice!
B006OKOZGU|5.0|classic movie,  Got to be one of the best ever.  Grace Kelly is one of the most beautiful women ever
B008Y6WMEY|5.0|Great Movie!  Peter Sellers is great in his three roles, however George C. Scott delivers an over the top performance that steals the show.  This movie is a great political satire from the 1950's and early 60's that still holds up in modern day.  I watched this movie with my 15 year old daughter and only had to give her a general understanding of the background politics of the times for her to understand and find it funny.
B001NLKXK2|4.0|Tells AD story realistically and gripping in flow.. Good awareness tool for family and frineds of a sufferer. $ stars only becuase it does not really address the caregiver role but recognize that sufferer is primary focus
B0099RFVXQ|4.0|Very good action movie, usual Whedon ensemble cast work. Fun and not entirely predictable.4 stars because its an action movie, it wont change your life.
B00AZRBLHO|5.0|The strength of this book is how it connects abstract concepts like the three ways with concrete problems that will be familiar to anyone in corporate IT. The situations in the book super realistic I have seen. The value lies in the analysis of why things so often play out the way they do, and how insights such as the three ways can be applied for better outcomes. One realization I had is that IT work can be standardized. This seems impossible at first, but the book makes it seem possible and if you can start to believe it is possible, you will figure out how to make it so. It is important to think of things in a systems way, but you can't do that unless you can see the work centers.
B0085Z8F4A|5.0|I'm a fan boy, so this movie may not be for everyone. It's not perfect, but if you can put that aside and enjoy the ride, you're in for a treat.
B008VO3PA4|3.0|There is some really funny stuff here for cat lovers. Unfortunately, some of it is a stretch.  It is as if Marciuliano ran out of ideas before the book was finished and just came up with a few more to justify the publication.<br />It is expensive for its size, about 50 cents per poem with the discount.  It would be fun to read standing up in a book store, but not worth buying and taking home.  Maybe it would work as a gift for a cat fanatic.
B00BF8OYJO|3.0|It was a very good short story, took less than 5 minutes to read.  It probably could have been a bit longer.
B003L77G6A|5.0|I just love this show.  And I love having the DVD's enabling me to watch it over and over whenever I want.  As in the last three seasons, the writing is exceptional and the sight gags are hilarious.  The cast just gets better and better.  My favorite show on television!
B00FHALFK2|5.0|Great CD! Lots of kinds of songs for any mood you're in. I just regret buying the clean on accident. On the mobile version of amazon mp3, couldn't see the clean version part..
B002N5N4M6|5.0|This show ranks up there with &#34; I love Lucy&#34;,&#34; Laverne & Shirley&#34;, and my favorite &#34;Frazier&#34;.  The writing, the physical comedy scenes, and the terrific ensemble cast is exceptional.  I watch these episodes over and over and still laugh, sometimes hysterically, everytime.  I have the previous two seasons also.  I knew guys like these in High School and College and it is spot on as far as the quirkiness and even the dress of the lovable &#34;Nerds&#34; I knew.  I look forward to watching the show each week.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Awesome!!!!! The suspense is unnerving.  Sometimes I have to get up and walk away to take the edge off.  I love this show.
B007GCY8FS|5.0|Great Reacher read.  Moved quickly.  Keeps the reader interested with twist and turns to plot and sub plots.  Look forward to next book
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I love playing candy cushion saga its give me a challenge.  Not only am I addict to the game but my friends are to.
B003B02O0A|4.0|It was very captivating but very sad to think that there is that much racism existing in parts of this country and I think it hasn't gotten any better!
1401917232|5.0|Wow: I have been a student of A Course in Miracles since 1987. I also read the other two books .. I found this book to be truly a forgiveness opportunity. I didn't expect the book to give me any answers that I couldn't receive from the Holy Spirit. But, I had some interesting insights. I felt that the Mary that was being referenced was Jesus' Mother not<br />Mary Magdalene! I also found myself accepting Gary as a  \\"Holy Child of God.\\" And as the Course states:<br />\\"Forgiveness is the key to happiness.\\"
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I've always loved Grisham books and this one is no exception.  You won't be disappointed.  I could read his books every day.
B00CLD65X0|5.0|Great series! I'm completely addicted! I can't wait for season 4 to start, I'm going to wait till it's on Prime to watch it!
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Loved this movie!!!!! I loved every minute of it. Action packed and it kept my attention all the way to the end!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Good Book. I was disappointed by the ending but overall it tied the other two books well and did justice to the series.
B008NCSZQ8|4.0|Lots of action and Good wins over Evil, I liked the story line. Even though we all know Evil sometimes wins I don't want to see that in a show.
B004LROUNG|2.0|I found The Litigators to be repetitious & boring.  I usually always finish a book whether I like it or not, and I did with this one, but was glad to come to the end.  It wasn't difficult to know what the outcome would be - no sitting on the edge wondering.  I am a fan of John Grisham & when I read the reviews, some stating their was humor in this book, I thought it would be a different read from him.  I didn't find the humor, if there was any & sorry to say it was a disappointment.
0770435726|4.0|This is not deep literature but a very well-written, enjoyable spy story. It shows the layers of deception that can exist in a marriage, a friendship, or in employment. There's a humorous thread about the rivalry and lack of trust between the FBI and CIA. It's always fun when someone finds a major clue in a high school year book. Because of the short distances involved the characters got around to several countries in central Europe which is always interesting to read about.
B0064X7FVE|2.0|Works.. does not work. Works.. does not work. Works..does not work.  Very hit and miss. Not sure how long it remains..
051788710X|5.0|During the past several years, frequent, recurring nightmares have disturbed my sleeping dreams.  A co-worker and healer suggested that dreams recur because they are trying to get a message through and that I might enjoy reading CONSCIOUS DREAMING.<br /><br />Enjoy is not the descriptor I would use for how I interacted with this book.  Words more like absorb or consume might be better.  I was mesmerized.<br /><br />The writer, Australian born American Shaman, Robert Moss is a dreamer, workshop leader, and author.  His voice is authentic and speaks from personal experience and vicarious experience sharing his own dream worlds and those of others.<br /><br />He gives practical and impractical, but workable advise about how to be present to the dreamworlds while waking, sleeping, or journeying, giving examples of how one might hear or see the message being sent.  Among these possibilities are incubating a dream (asking for an answer to a specific question to come to you in the dream state before going to sleep) and a special way he shares for recording the dream story upon awakening and processing the dream.<br /><br />The writer also gives many examples of dream stories told in dream-groups or workshops and how the dreams came to be understood by the dreamer.<br /><br />His most important point:  you are the master interpreter of your own dreams.<br /><br />For me, this book and one particular other, (JOURNEY OF SOULS, Michael Newton) informed my own  dreamworld study over a two-and-one-half year period following the deaths of my parents in 2009, especially focused on the nightmares I mentioned.<br /><br />I am profoundly changed for the better, and further am currently working to finish a full-length manuscript of  poetry born out of that study, messages from the ether I continue to process and integrate into my world view and understanding.<br /><br />I own this book.  I will keep and revisit this book.  I highly recommend it to you, the dreamer seeking consciousness and connection with the dreamworlds.s and connection with the dreamworlds.
B008K6HN8I|5.0|Best way to get around your tablet.  Intuitive layout means you can get into trouble on your Kindle even though Amazon doesn't want you to. :-)
B006LSZECO|5.0|Couldn't put it down. It was hard to root for any of the characters but it is so plot-driven I didn't mind. Great psychological thriller
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|Absolutely awful.  Do not buy this game, it rings you in and then you have to pay to move forward or wait and unreasonable time.  See my other 5 star suggestion for a match game.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|I had deleted some apps, however they still took up space on my Kindle.  After installing this app, I was able to increase the storage after Clean Master removed the residue from my device.  I will 're- review if I find any problems with this app.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's addictive but not easy.it too is asking for money and for connections with Facebook neither of which I am into.
B005K0HDGE|5.0|This was such a great book.  He really did his homework into the Kennedy assassination.  Fascinating how he wove the history into time travel by a man who did not plan on any of it.  I was very entertained by this, I thought it should be a movie some day. There are some lulls in the story, like he was just filling pages or something.  He writes very detailed of everyday life of his character.  Kept me very engrossed at times, when I should put it down but could not.
B0088EDMMS|5.0|excellent halloween movie for both adults and kids to watch. good range of actors  mildler, najiminy, and parker very funny.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Play this every once in a while but really like it.  Helps pass the time when not much is going on.
B003YGSLDA|5.0|ecellent christmas movie for the family , a definite classic  well worth having in yr holiday collection. good price for a blu ray.
B000XUBFE2|4.0|Interesting point of view!  It does take a little while to warm up to but once you do, it's wonderful.
B005K17RU0|5.0|It gives up to date weather info and is easy to use.  You can check the weather in as many cities as you like.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Lot's of fun. hard at times but very addicting. the game should have an unlimited amount of levels. definately recommend it to friends.
0316322407|4.0|It is a little wordy, but gives a good insight into life in a totally different part of the world that is difficult for the West to fathom. The insightful part is the the description of Talliban tactics and their similarity to some of tjhe politicians here, such as Joe McCarthy and similar, reminding us that we must always be vigilant.
B00006LI4D|5.0|I purchased this album to hear jazz guitarist Russell Malone and was not disappointed. I met Russell when he was playing at the Montreal jazz festival with Diana Krall. Through him I also met Diana and we all had dinner together. Now Russell is making albums of his own, and, as expected, they are simply fabulous .Also special mention must go to the late, great bassist Ray Brown on this gig. The man will always be close to my heart. Thank you.
B00AHGSVKS|5.0|Brilliant! Surely one of the best apocalyptic stories that I ever read.<br />And, it's true that there are many references to this story in newer &#34;ET related&#34; movies. Hope that I will be able to see a, well done, live action movie entirely based on this book.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I have read almost every John Grisham novel and this is hands down my favorite. The ending was a tad sappy and implausible, but I know I feel that way only because of my own personal bias. That has nothing to do with the fact that this was a page turning great read that took me away from everything for a couple of days. Would make a great movie which I'm sure has to be already in the works. WOW!
B00C7TAF3Y|5.0|Super puzzle game. This game is very addictive. I can't wait until The Room 2 comes out...This game is mind boggling, enjoy everybody
B001IF277K|5.0|good product great price
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|great writing, gritty acting.  I have watched every episode of all six seasons so far.  Just going back to remind myself about how it started.  Cant watch ti enough!
B003VWU2WA|1.0|I choosed it because it's very light and small but it's not multipurpose enough, not very convenient and limited. I advice to buy the &#34;3D Connexion Navigator&#34; which is more expensive but worth it.
B0046B1KHG|5.0|This is my children's favorite movie.  The watch it everyday.  I will get Despicable Me 2. The streaming works great.
B00FN811SY|5.0|Superb app - and wil surely improve, even though its almost perfect now! It works flawlessly and is ever so quick.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|awesome story, great plot and very interesting outcome. I loved the flow and the unexpected twist. Can't wait until the next novel comes out
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is so awesome and if you DOWNLOAD it today there is a new board for free its awesome.
B00C5R7B0I|1.0|I have read every book in the Scarpetta series but made it thru less than 20 pages of this one.  I am disgusted and appalled at Patricia Cornwell's exploitation of the Sandy Hook Elementary tragedy.  Kay Scarpetta is a fictional character and Patricia Cornwell's audacity to write Scarpetta in to the Sandy Hook tragedy is disrespectful to the victims and survivors.  Shame on you.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|It was just ok. I was disappointed with the writing, especially the ending. It seemed like the author gave up and didn't want to write a fitting ending. I felt like it didn't make sense either. The other two books in the series were much better. It's too bad, I was so excited to share this series with friends, but I don't think I could wholeheartedly recommend this book.
0571238343|5.0|I had the original version of this when I was in college. It was a required text, and I soon understood why. So when I got the chance to get my hands on a copy of the expanded version I saved my pennies! I was not disappointed. I wish there was a more expanded portion in regards to character design basics, but with how much is in this book that is a Minor complaint. This touches on topic that I struggled with in college (timing and smoother, more believable tweens).<br /><br />OH! the pages are already showing signs of wear because of how much I reference it on any given animation-based project!  So far the binding has held up, which is very important to me.
B0081FO2Q4|5.0|I love his music.  Its crosses over all genres of music.  I listen to it on my way to work to get me in the mood to face the day.
0823023494|5.0|This books isn't exactly a be-all-end-all for character design. Rather it is a refinement of character design. The reader should have a basic understanding of character design fundamentals, and how a viewer perceives the different types of character bodies, already. This book walks us through a more in-depth process of HOW to come up with what a character looks like based on the story or idea behind them.<br /><br />Any time I have difficulty in working out what a character should look like, I thumb through this book to find inspiration and advice.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|I never was a reader of books through most of my life.  I did grow up on Steven King movies, and thought most were awful- but knowing he did not make the movies - I cannot hold him to blame.  I watched The Shining and loved it, also loved The Stand.  Late in life, I  began reading books, including 11-22-63.  It is the best of hundreds I've read.  Having just finished Doctor Sleep, this was excellent as a continuation of The Shining.  I plan to now read those books I hated as movies.
B00CW7KK9K|4.0|I really like it... There is more in the market but this one is what I bought and filled all my expectations
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Awesome experiments to prove that LOA is in everyone's lives, AND we can get what we want<br />Congrats Pam x
B008JFUUQ2|5.0|I literally watch this movie on a weekly basis. I love the comedy and the performances are amazing. This is just a great movie.
B001PPGAIK|5.0|Great acting, well written, adorable young actor. Beautiful scenery, great history, beautiful costume designs. And Hugh Jackman taking a shower, half clothed in the wilderness!! He even looked sexy in his dirty clothes. Everyone in this movie did a super job. You didn't mind the 3 hrs or so because it definitely kept your attention. One of my all time favorite movie because it made me laugh, cry and pay attention. And of course I own the dvd!
B002MQYOFW|5.0|My favorite book series hands down. I Like how the movies (so far) follow the books for the most part
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|it is a well written book and it explains alot of thing I did not know before. Its eye opening
B003O86FMW|5.0|One of my favorite book series, hands down. I do like how the movies follow along with the books (so far) for the most part
B00DR0PDNE|1.0|This item was a waste of money. Chrome streaming keeps error-ing out. Streaming from YouTube works, but picture quality is not clear (very poor). I wish I could say something good about the device and I gave it a 2 month try, but it does not live up to the hype and expectations fell very short. I would not recommend it to my worst enemy.
B00DBSZEH2|5.0|I really liked this movie, it was a new twist on Hansel & Gretel.....and looking at Jeremy Renner doesn't hurt either :)
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I an 100% hooked on this game. I am glad that is now available for my Kindle Fire. Great game to play while waiting in the doctor office.
B0074PNCRM|5.0|Perfect and beautifully written, but be warned... It take a piece of your heart you'll never get back. The movie may kill me.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Pretty much the same as everyone else. I feel like she should release an alternative ending. Otherwise, I won't be watching any movies, reading any of the short stories that are coming out, or recommending any of the books to my friends. It's a shame since Divergent was one of the most entertaining books I have ever read.
B001L83PLQ|4.0|Excellent book about a subject that not too many people know.  Very tragic story, well told.  The characters come to life - I will definitely read more books by this author.  The story begins before Biafra split from Nigeria.  The main protagonists are from the Igbo tribe, a large group quite separate from many of the other tribes that make up the population of Nigeria.  The Igbo form their own nation, but sadly it only lasts two years.  The people end up surrendering and returning to Nigeria - the children are starving, many thousands die.  No food, medical facilities and even housing slowly disappear because of fighting.  The Biafrans have no money, their soldiers do not have proper equipment of any kind.  They practice with wooden guns.  The characters are, of course, fictitious - but the setting is based on real history.
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Pendergast at his finest... Can't wait for more books to come out. I hope they continued with Pendergast in the future.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|This book lets the world see cancer through young, intelligent, witty, unforgettable teenage eyes. It is a story of love, hate, cruelty, acceptance, pain, death and survival. It is a story well written and unexpected, bravo John Green.
006202406X|1.0|This book was nothing like the first two.  The first two stories had sustained action and kept me hooked into the story.  This book was boring and I had to force myself to finish it.  Writing from both characters perspective took away from the book and more often than not I had to flip back and see who the narrator was.  Excluding the steaming dung heap of an ending this book was just so-so. My immediate feeling upon completion was slumped shoulders disappointment.  Would not recommend the series and would not recommend this book if you have read the first two.  Just use your imagination for an ending because anything would be better than this.
B0051UP5NQ|1.0|I  am using the app on a Kindle Fire HD with the large screen. I created a slide. I cannot edit text effectively. I try to delete a letter and the app deletes a letter in the next word instead. In order to get a good bullet point on the slide, I have to type it without error.<br /><br />Also it is difficult to position the pointer to the text I want to edit.
B00422LESO|5.0|I thought this story would be predictable.  But Shannon kept you on your toes clear to the very end.  I laughed out loud several times.  Great read!
B009BWGQRE|4.0|Believable characters. Excellent photography. Suspense drama about high-risk mountain climbing. Subtitles don't detract at all. One of the best of this type
B002PQ7JQK|5.0|Don't go to eBay on this one as I was ripped off there.  If you are a Trekkie or like classic TV, this set is for you.  High quality and wonderful memories abound.
B00BOTCJXC|5.0|5-hour miniseries is worth every minute.  Cumberbatch is a driving force in taking you through 10 years early 20th Century
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I really enjoyed Divergent, Insurgent was good not great, and unfortunately I was underwhelmed by Allegiant.  The explanations offered seemed weak and I just didn't like the way the series was wrapped up.
B00G32OER4|5.0|Been wanting to see this Movie Sense it came out. It is a Great Movie, It deals with the 70's when stuff like this was hidden.
B000JMKRKC|5.0|I cannot begin to tell you how enchanting - and hauntingly written - this story is. I loved every page. I got myself a bit confused in one section trying to keep a few children straight in my mind but once I got over that - it was a real page turner to the end. I wish this were to be made into a movie. The possibilities would be amazing! The story comes across like a Victorian haunting but it is really set in the 1920-30's. Captivating - you will not be disappointed at all! Perfect winter read before a roaring fire!
1250038820|5.0|Love Brandon and love his work! I'm a huge fan!  If you enjoy everyday photography from a unique perspective, this is so great.
B005PK57IK|5.0|Each season gets better & better. All the actors are outstanding. Such good continuing story lines. Very smart,trendy & realistic.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|This movie is a fresh twist to the old worn out plodding zombies!  The star isn't a favorite, however he does play his roles very good.  It is fast passed and a interesting ending, or is it an ending?
B00A6CCF0K|3.0|Ok so now we know what happened to Danny, the new bogey men are scary but leaves you wishing for more.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Absolutely loved this book. So well written I could hardly put it down. Now I am finished and I can get back to sleeping.
B004UID2LC|4.0|What's not to love? Rather than suffer through the constant buffering of directly viewing/listening to something on YouTube, I can download is directly to my phone then enjoy my selection seamlessly. The download is very slow - but still a vast improvement.
B005LAJ16I|5.0|This refers to the first and second seasons of Homeland and what I have seen so far of the third.  Based on other American television series, I had low expectations for this one as well.  I was amazed and delighted to see America rise to the quality of show I normally find only from BBC.  I ordered the discs to add to my personal library, as I know I will want to watch these again.
B006PKQQJS|1.0|Seriously disappointed in the functionality of this game. Shows up as a small picture in the corner of the screen. Not going to play it this way so I'm pretty bummed that I wasted the money in it.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|We use this every single day in our house. It makes life and streaming so much easier, especially when you're watching Netflix or Youtube because your computer isn't blocked due to what's playing (like it would be when connected via HDMI). It also came with a 3 month Netflix code, so that was an added bonus!
B006Z00R1Q|3.0|Good movie......similar to the other paranormal series. Keeps you on the edge of your seat. If you liked the other films.... You will like this one also.
B0017SWPXY|5.0|I loved this book.  It spoke to me on so many different levels.  It may have even brought a tiny tear to my eye.
B00ARN0XGG|3.0|Same as the other paranormal movies.  If you liked them........... You will like this one. It is worth a look.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|It gets too much into family tree. A person is getting an inheritance and a family tree is detailed, which is rather boring.
B008J8KBKY|4.0|Challenging 3D version of connect 4 game even in &#34;Easy&#34; mode.  Great game to play when you have a limited time.
B00DUGCLY4|4.0|it is fun to play, but if i cant figure a level out it starts to get boring. but all in all, it's a really good app
B00CWY76CC|5.0|Excellent app and worth the time.  Enjoyed playing and look forward to escaping from New rooms.  Would like to see at least 20 rooms per game.
B00EEDNA4M|1.0|Love the show... but this is what netflix is for.. Thats too much to pay for a show i can see for free
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|this is really fun and I enjoy it and if you like bejeweled or tetris you will like this game too
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Although I am happy to have finished the series and I am glad to have closure, I was really disappointed in the ending.  The book was also confusing because every other chapter the book switched character point of views.  I constantly had to keep checking to see whose perspective I was reading about.  The other two books were much better and I wish the ending would have been different.  Overall, good series
B006LSZECO|4.0|Good book.  Very twisted.  A little confusing when the author keeps changing character perspectives but overall a good read.  I didn't want to put it down.  Hoping for a sequel!
B0028NSE3M|5.0|I had this music before on vinal but wore it out so I just needed to replace it while I could
B00D3V8PSC|5.0|Great to hear Sabbath back together after all these years and really kicking. Not a bad cut on the album including the extended cuts.
B007IXWL2C|1.0|No story.  What about Christian Grey  What was this book about other than sex habits. it was very very boring
B0064T6LV8|5.0|Love it! Haven't played Pinball in a long time. Love how I can choose the 3 different ones instead of playing the same one over and over.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Need more levels stat!  Love this addicting game!  It's fun, addicting & best game available for download to date, true story!
B00A757EFW|1.0|After I got it. It was really hard to do with your finger and it was different not having a stick to use and move Mr. Pac Man around on.
B0089LOG02|3.0|A smooth melding of Molly's and Niamh's (Vivian's) stories kept me reading until the wee hours. I could sense Molly's defenses falling away like scales from her eyes as she gradually realized that her life, while not good, was a walk in the park compared to what the orphan train kids endured.<br />Not great literature, by any means. But a plausible story with realistic characters.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This game is addictive.  Can't stop once I start playing!  It's fun playing against family and friends and beating them!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|really loving this game _0_0 can't believe it took so long for me to catch the wave! !!!!! so really now I just can't wait to catch up with everyone else @_@
B00E72OKAS|3.0|My grandson is the one who plays it and I think it might be a little to advanced for him.  He does seem to enjoy the concept of the game.
B0013TXA5Y|5.0|I chose the five stars because it had everything a teen could always dream of. An adventurous plot, modern day looks, and of course a dramatic love triangle !
B000FBJF6Y|4.0|A quick, easy read, this book has a lot of soul. The characters, setting, history and plot are described in a simple yet well thought out manner. It's a fast-paced, fun, and heart-warming story with characters you will quickly fall in love with. I give it four stars because it lacks the richness and depth of a classic, but it's fast, fun and entertaining for an easy, casual read.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Loved it! Fast paced film. Not enough blood and gore compared to other zombie apocalyptic films. Worth the rental of 99 cents!
B00CDV6WDS|1.0|There are not enough options available such as choice of formats, colors, hints, undo, etc.  The color was extremely bland and after a while everything started to look the same.
B0027BOL4G|5.0|This Documentary opens your eyes to how food is manufactured.  In Seattle, we had a initiative that would be labeled genetic enhanced food.  One of the major contributors against this is Monsanto which patented a seed that allows them to sue farmers who harvest seeds that include their patented seeds.  Monsanto let the winds do the dirty work, and many farmers were put out of business.  On the other side is Chipotle which went organic (see the report from Nightline in the Extras.  I strongly recommend anyone interested in what they are eating top buy this DVD
B00BGIC170|4.0|But I found this movie a hilarious girls night or date night movie. Had me literally LOL'ing many times.<br /><br />Highly amusing & I would have watched it more than once if I'd been able to... but only had the rental for 24 hours is my only complaint!
B003JTHWJQ|5.0|I consider this necessary reading for anyone interested in addressing and understanding the incongruity between religious claims and modern scientific knowledge about  the nature of ourselves and the world we live in.  It is extremely well written and, while pointed and aggressively opinionated, it sticks to the facts. It is also not without a degree of puckish humor and interesting turns of phrase. (He efficiently refers to Mormon founder Joseph Smith as an &#34;enterprisingly mendacious inventor.&#34;)
B00F91SCXC|3.0|Predictable storyline...not really scary...acting was okay... thought it was mostly worth the rental price but I am glad I didn't pay for movie tickets to see it.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As an avid fan of The Shining, both the novel and Stanley Kubrick film, I wasted no time in buying this sequel. This was a very quick read and had me instantly hooked. It's not as closely tied to the story line of the prequel as I had hoped, but I enjoyed learning what became of Danny. I would have liked it to be more horrifying. King is certainly a master in description of a terrifying moment, both visually and timing-wise. The agony of death for human or other is vivid and awful. The story follows an easy arc, not always predictable, but near the end became pretty obvious. I find King one of the best &#34;finishers&#34; of novels in that you couldn't see what was coming, but this one was easier to figure out early. It's not as scary as the Shining maybe because I didn't care about the characters as much as I did in the original. But it's a very good read and a good follow-up to a great horror story.
B002CIMKHO|5.0|Clint like you've never seen him before...he's old, he's crabby and he's a racist bigot and you like him anyway.  Great story line with an ending you didn't quite expect
B008UX2UIO|5.0|What a gem of a book. This is one of the funniest books I've ever read, wrapped up in astute social commentary, with characters that walk off the page. This is one of the best books I've ever read.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|This series was phenomenal...I was looking forward to the third book for months...and when I read it I thought it was a joke.  Veronica Roth needs a redo on this one...the book was such a letdown!
B0018CWEZ8|5.0|Be forewarned, there are some spoilers from season 4 and the prior seasons in this review.  The season 4 spoilers are kept to a minimum but if you have not seen prior seasons proceed with caution.<br /><br />Season 4 of lost was shortened by the writers strike so there are 14 episodes instead of the usual 22-24.  This season puts the focus back on the \\"main\\" castaways instead that was lost somewhat in season 3 because of the heavy focus on The Others.  While that storyline still exists and we learn more about the island and who wants to find it, a lot of the fate of the main characters is revealed.<br /><br />This season picks up where last season kicked off.  Most of the flashes in this season are flash forwards, revealing the fate of the 6 characters who make it off the island.  In the season finale we find out exactly how they made it off.  Jack finds out about his sister and we discover that revelation sent him into the tail spin that took him to where the flash forward at the very end of season 3 showed him to be.  However the flashes in the beginning of the season basically progress up to that point so we see how he and the other Oceanic Six try to reintegrate into society.  We also learn more about Ben's motives as the season goes along.  As with prior seasons there are people that get killed off, but that does not mean you see the last of them.<br /><br />As far as the discs go.  The A/V quality is great.  There are a ton of bonus features, that total well over 2 hrs.  The best being a \\"documentary\\" about the Oceanic Six conspiracy.  There are also deleted and extended scenes, commentary, and a great featurette that uses scenes we did not see (whether they were deleted scenes or things that were filmed later) to fill in the gaps of things that actually aired.  So for those who like all the extras there is definitely enough there to keep you happy.  They also went back to the version of season play that told you the episode you left off in and how far into ityou were.  And at the end of each disc it had the find out what happens next pop ups.  Not anything big, but they were missing from the season 3 discs.

B003KRJNBW|3.0|I enjoyed the movie in that it could well portray how life could be after a nuclear war or disaster.

B00EW9GQR6|5.0|One aspect of being a truly good artist is having the ability to reinvent oneself or evolve in such a way to give the audience something completely new while still remaining true to a certain type of sound or feeling. There have been so many musical acts through time that have faded slowly into oblivion during their long careers due to not being able to change and adapt with the surrounding culture they reside in. Today's music scene flies with breakneck speeds towards new highs, lows, styles, and sounds, and for many of the modern artists stationed in this period of space and time, it becomes a struggle to stay afloat. The cause of this is due to the artists that actually are setting those high boundaries, traversing into new territory on their own, and keeping up with global aural awareness yet without following the lead of any specific artist or brand. One mainstream album this year has completely succeeded in its ability to demonstrate these rules in action, and it will be heralded as one of the best mainstream albums of the year.<br /><br />The album I'm talking about is Lady Gaga's new album \\"ARTPOP\\", which is her 3rd major LP release. This is going to be a long review and I'm going to just say this right now: This is arguably the best work she has ever made, and I truly believe it transcends her above any other major pop name in America right now. The direction she has decided to take is a complete 180* from her previous album, \\"Born this Way\\", which was great in its own right, but fell short in many places. She has dropped the style that was based more on experimentation and diversity, often filled with slower ballads and strange instrumental work, and has returned to an electrically-charged electronic style that made her first album such a hit.<br /><br />This 3rd album is full of floor smashing, rock hard beats. Some of the kicks and drums layered into the under workings of each track are so aurally clear that it feels like you're listening to them in a complete sonic vacuum. The attention to detail throughout the album is on another level and it sounds like it could have only come from a production team that is completely meticulous. Lady Gaga absolutely had a ton of help on both the production and writing of the album. Among the producers are Zedd and Madeon, traditionally electro-house producers and DJ's, as well as Paul Blair, who helped her on her last two records. Many other names from piano players to jazz musicians are also on the roster. The album is both eclectic yet defining. Each track should be looked at individually:<br /><br />Track Reviews:<br /><br />01 - Aura: This is the strangest track on the album and I believe it was the right choice for a first track. It starts with a Kill Bill style wild west riff and after some interesting chants from Lady Gaga (LG), it builds and breaks into a beat that feels both organic and mechanical in nature. The message of the song is somewhat cheesy, but it's this playful light-hearted nature that makes Lady Gaga who she is as an artist. She's not trying to make any political statements with her music and that should always be kept in mind with music of this dance-inducing caliber. It should be noted that Infected Mushroom, a psychedelic trance group from Israel, helped produce this track. You can hear their style in some of the bizarre sounds and riffs. 9.0/10<br /><br />02 - Venus: This track is just as good the previous and LG really belts out the vocals in some parts. Those vocals feel natural and there is definitely no sort of auto-tune crap on top of it. If you've ever seen LG perform unplugged, you know that she needs no machine help to bring out her vocal essence. 9.0/10<br /><br />03 - G.U.Y.: A darker track, due to the breakbeat style production behind it. Once again, these lyrics are not breaking any political or societal boundaries, and just thinking about listening to this when wanting to do anything but move and groove is fairly humorous. Great track with a really hard beat that grooves into the soul. 8.0/10<br /><br />04 - Sexxx Dreams: Slower and less hard-hitting than almost any other track on the album. Definitely not one of my favorites, and feels like something from the previous \\"Born this Way\\" album. 6.0/10<br /><br />05 - Jewels N' Drugs (feat. Too Short, Twista, T.I.): Wow, this was something I didn't expect to see. A legendary bay area rapper who's been rapping since 1984, Too Short, and a completely fired-up wordsmith from Ohio, Twista, really rock it on this song. It's an interesting dynamic to hear LG's slow and accentuated singing right before Too Short comes in with his complete thug appeal. Unfortunately, the track is fairly abysmal for a hip hop track and the beat has that annoying top 40 sensation to it while trying to be too gangster. Nice attempt at something new, but falls short. 5.5/10<br /><br />06 - Manicure: An active track with various timings at different sections, sometimes backed by guitar, sometimes by extra drums. The lyrics on this track are mediocre and I'd actually say they do detract from the overall song, but it's still a pretty good piece with a fun beat. 7.0/10<br /><br />07 - Do What U Want (feat. R. Kelly): YES. Oh my god, yes. Here we are. The next three tracks are the best on the album. This specific track is completely phenomenal. The beat is something like a mix between an electric Eurythmics track and a 1990's slower RNB tunes. The chorus is uplifting and is filled with feeling, and the dynamic between LG and R. Kelly leaves absolutely nothing to be desired. In my opinion, this is the kind of track that proves LG is not just some Madonna clone for the modern age. It's unique, it's soulful, and it has a sound that is unmistakably her own. 10/10<br /><br />08 - Artpop: I always pray for the title track of any album to be a great representation of the album as a whole. In this case, Artpop succeeds with flying colors. It's one of the strongest tracks on the album and might objectively become the best if it withstands the test of time. Although much more laid back than the other electronic-vibed songs on the album, the beat has a mysterious and complex rhythm to it that lends itself well to a more thoughtful nature. Once again, I feel like it has sort of a \\"Sweet Dreams\\" quality to it. The kind of beat that is hitting both highs and lows all at once, the darker and the lighter aspects intertwining to create something that resonates in the body and becomes deeper than the actual sound itself. 9.5/10<br /><br />09 - Swine: Back to the hard hitters. The beat is reminiscent of LG's \\"Bad Romance\\", although pitched higher and with a more erratic pace. At about 1:30, the song kicks into full electronic mode and this is by far the most digitally-charged section of the album. The vocals return after another minute but the beat keeps its pace. Lyrically, Lady Gaga is referring to a specific individual in the darker years of her past that could be accurately described as a \\"pig\\". It's relevant and understandable to the nightlife scene in many parts of the globe. This track is extremely strong. 9.0/10<br /><br />10 - Donatella: At first I thought this track's lyrics were referring to LG herself, and I disliked it very much, but a few more listens proved that she is actually making a statement towards rich, high-class and high-maintenance women that are only into fashion and money and will do anything to keep looking thin even if it's not healthy. It's a bit of a statement towards the socialite culture, which is obviously somewhat of a pathetic thing. Overall this track is not one of the greats, but it's decent. 7.5/10<br /><br />11 - Fashion!: Better than the previous track and LG & Giorgio Tuinfort playing the piano really helps the beat out. There is also a very nice bassy sound happening consistently in the background and it makes the track pop.  Great production throughout by the many names who helped on this track. The chorus and vocals actually remind me of a group like New Order in the way they are presented. 8.0/10<br /><br />12 - Mary Jane Holland: There's a... marijuana track on the album? Didn't see this one coming. Yes, it does seem like she is completely praising marijuana, although I can't tell if there is any different underlying meaning. Lines like \\"Cause I love, love you better than my darkest sin\\", as well as talking about truffles from Amsterdam seem to reinforce the idea that she is fully pro-marijuana, which is quite fine by me. The track itself is pretty decent with a good beat. A bit slower on the BPM's; good vocals; strange, eerie sounds going on in the background of the beat. Overall, above average compared to its adjacent tracks. 8.0/10<br /><br />13 - Dope: There had to be one slow ballad song on the album, and although it's definitely not my forte to rate tracks like this, I do like this overall. Apparently it's based off a letter from a fan who says something along the lines of the relationship she had (\\"I need you more than dope\\"). Vocals are definitely top tier and professional on this. 7.5/10<br /><br />14 - Gypsy: An extremely positive and uplifting track with a quickened pace that forces you to keep up. This song is about traveling the world and living somewhat of a gypsy life, and what kinds of positives and negatives come with that. The beat on this is layered and thick, the bpm's pitched up, and the overall vibe is more thoughtful than most of the other tracks on the album. Great song. 8.0/10<br /><br />15 - Applause: The first single from the album is definitely not the strongest track on the album but it's not a bad end to the album, especially considering its name and the lyrics within. A quirky beat that keeps changing up in the back of the track makes sense for the somewhat shallow lyrics on the surface. A relevant end to the album and leaves you wanting more. 7.5/10<br /><br />Conclusion:<br /><br />As stated before, this is Lady Gaga's best work and a step in the right direction. Hard electronic music backing up her vocals works a lot better than the slower and more instrument packed experimental style of some prior releases. While her first album will always remain a top tier release in the world of pop music thanks to songs like Just Dance and Pokerface, ARTPOP is a better product as a whole and represents an evolved style of an artist who is much more musically talented than people give her credit for. In my opinion, she has now proven that she has complete understanding and control of the style of music that she is able to excel in as an individual. ARTPOP is an extremely fun album that doesn't try to take itself too seriously. It's light-hearted and bouncy nature will appeal very much to dance music fans, while never getting too extreme to alienate any other type of music listener.<br /><br />I completely recommend this CD to anyone who is a fan of well-produced music. The crystal clear nature of the beats and rhythms throughout the LP are obviously multi-million dollar affairs, and they do complete justice to dance music in general. The team who worked in this album has delivered the best pop album of 2013 and I doubt there will be a close contender for 2nd place.<br /><br />5/5 stars.objectively become the best if it withstands the test of time.

B00881VLCE|4.0|I have had no problem with the game. It's relatively easy and you choose the difficulty level. It has beautiful pictures. I have not run out of free pictures as yet. Hopefully the free ones last as long as my interest.
B00FMJJ064|5.0|in a world of rehashed music it is wonderful to hear something fresh and new. If you want to hear full versions and not the little previews check out her youtube channel.
B004ZISVRW|1.0|Too phony in so many ways. Poor acting from all of the participants. It is not worth the time to watch.
B00AQ3K8IU|4.0|Seems a bit dark at first but is pretty cool once you really get into it.<br />Thinking about getting the sequel now
B00B5HQLMI|5.0|What a great movie. Lots of action and a very good plot! Clearly this is a great winner for James Bond!!
140006922X|3.0|This book is a nice summary of the geopolitical situation during the time of Jesus and provides useful insights to context the Bible stories.  In that respect I found the book to be pretty useful.<br /><br />What fell way short was the analysis of the situation and the conclusions drawn from the historical facts.<br /><br />He made a point at the beginning of the book that writing in this era and this culture freely mixed myth with hard historical facts in order to make a point.  Fair enough.  But then he went on the either refute information as being &#34;made up and patently false&#34; or he used the information to bolster a point he was trying to make.  I'm sorry but you can't have it both ways.  The selective use of Bible quotes and data to support a conclusion he wished to reach became just plain silly at times.
B006FPFTMS|4.0|I was looking for something with a bit more functionality than Adober's default reader for Android/Kindle. Something that could at the very least handle bookmarks and better searches in large PDFs. I was leery of trying Foxit at first as I found their web plugin to be a burden, but after downloading and trying Foxit Mobile PDF I was impressed enough to decide to keep it on. Searching is still a bit slower than what I'd like, but, in a side by side comparison with Adobe it was better.
B009C7ZQM4|5.0|My Kindle Fire had gotten very very sluggish.  Calls to Amazon helpline proved unhelpful.  On a whim, I thought I'd try one of these apps.  Clean Master was perfect!  It installed quickly, was easy to follow and restored the Kindle Fire to nearly new operating levels.
B008JMKN4Y|5.0|Loved this book.  Loved watching two broken personalities try to find out how they work their ways into each other's lives without breaking each other more.  Yes, Travis is overbearing and controlling.  Would I put up with a guy like that.  Hell no, but I loved reading him.  Jamie McGuire wrote a beautifully broken man that you wanted to route for.  She wrote Abby in a way that made you see her struggles in wanting to love Travis through those faults.  I loved every minute of the struggle and the chemistry.
B008KTA64S|5.0|I love everything that is Gaslight Anthem and this CD doesn't disappoint! Way to go guys. There is always something new to the music but familiar enough to recognize the minute you hear Brian's voice.
B00G4I1CLS|5.0|Eye opening! I am shocked by the way the beautiful magnificent mammals are treated. I will never take my son to seaworld.  God bless you Tilikum
B004J4WKUQ|5.0|This book brought me so many happy flashbacks of my childhood, it is worth 5 stars for that alone. However, the story is wonderful. It pulls the reader into this virtual reality where a massive treasure hunt with intriguing riddles and clues, keeping the reader completely immersed into the main characters' quest. I stayed up late finishing the book and cannot wait to read it again to catch anything I might have missed in the first reading.
B00F8L2VO4|5.0|This app is easy to use, provides good practice for the vocabulary presented and doesn't seem to have any problems with working consistently.
0307946711|3.0|\\"One Day\\" can be at times a modest and mundane novel, and it can be at other times a confusing and confounding one.  It's essentially a love story between two polar opposites - Dexter and Emma - and it's an affecting one because it's spread over two decades and because even though the two lovers are meant to be together and they both know it so desperately they never do come together until the very end.  But while the novel is expansive, it really doesn't work, and allows itself to be suffocated by its ambition.  The main problem is that it's hard to care for Dex who is the very definition of glib, and so we can't possibly understand why someone as fragile and sensitive as Emma would fall so madly and deeply in love with him.  The other problem is that the plot is artificial, driven by its own need to move and to please - we're not at all sure why things happen the way they do, and the motivations and impulses of the characters feel too forced and manipulated.<br /><br />Author manipulation is the novel's main crime.  After sloughing through decent but soulless writing we as faithful readers are treated to such random violence towards the end that we feel lost and abandoned.  And that's when we realize that the long journey was never worth it in the first place.
B009C7ZQM4|4.0|its work good but keep popping up. don't know cleaning is done. hope all bugs are gone after cleaning thanks
B004U52VPS|3.0|The kids play with the birds more frequently as toys, than with this game. They got bored with it pretty fast.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|great game I can't stop playing, each level is a changes for me, and playing with other people is fun
B006DJ2JSI|5.0|it is an excellent application-very quick and easy to use-at all times!  nice to have it on the Kindle so it is there all the time
B00FWLDHSY|2.0|Like Hunman, seen him in other roles.  Dont like sci-fi, and this plot just too far-fetched to sit through even for the joy of watching Hunman
B00EQRMAJW|5.0|This cd is full of art, soul, and love. Each song captivates you so much so as if you are in each scenario he sings about. I love this album and recommend it to anyone seeking love in there future or already have that significant one. This cd will set the mood every time..Enjoy!
B000FC2L1E|5.0|Loved these books.  Even though they are very long I am always waiting for that next book to come out!!  I miss Claire and Jamie, and then where Diana gabaldon left us at that last book is just cruel!!  I am now starting to read the other books that are side stories to this series.
B00EYE0ECW|1.0|This is a slow, clunky app and a poor substitute for the official Google Maps app.  One more nail in the coffin of my Kindle Fire HDX.
B0071XO8RA|4.0|So glad I read this.  I got the first story &#34;Holston&#34; free, and of course, I was hooked.  Now I'm on to the next volume.  I like the writing, the plot, the realistic description of living in a silo.  Thank you for a very good read!
B0042TV4IW|5.0|Wonderful family show. Love the characters and the time period. The story lines are done beautifully and I enjoy how they all entertwine into each other from episode to epdisode. I have started season two and I am glad there are more shows to see. I would have been disappointed if they only did one season and left you hanging like some of th shows do at times. The character from Downtown Abbey...Mr. Bates, is in this series and I love him as an actor.
B00EGMQIJ0|3.0|Fun read but mediocre writing at best.  There are comparisons to 1984 but from a literary standpoint it's not even close.  It does however make you think about where we are headed (or have already done to ourselves) with regard to our individual privacy.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am addicted! LOVE LOVE LOVE this game! After 5 lives, you have to wait some time before getting more lives but I am glad because I don't know how many hours I would spend on this game if it didn't make me take a break!
B00EI2Y4MQ|4.0|Great little calculator. I love being able to edit calculations. I rarely find a faotd that I actually want, but this has value to me. I only wish it had financial functions as well. Thanks
B001XUJMZK|5.0|Great story about love and bravery!  This story is about people doing what they believe is right and not being afraid to stand up to the powerful people that dictate their lives.
B0058VW36U|5.0|Addicting game. Simple concept but totally enjoyable and the updates add great new levels every time. A must have game for everyone
B002RI9UBS|4.0|Some beautiful discriptive writing.The story took one through a gamut of emotions;<br />sadness, fearfulness, wonder, the joy of living and throughout the story there was humour<br />with laugh out loud moments. A really good read
B004JMSIRC|5.0|This is my favorite movie in the marvel avengers series so far. I have not seen the ironman 3 movie yet but have seen all up to the avengers and Thor 2.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I loved this series and was so excited for the third one to come out.  Unfortunately, I didn't care for this last installment as much, and without explaining the reasons why (because it would be spoiler), I'll just say I really didn't care for the ending.  Very creative series.  Well-rounded characters for the most part.  Kept you guessing all the way about what the outcome would be and who would do what.  I just didn't like the author's choices in this final book.
B00868AF9O|5.0|Who knew that some of the best lessons in humanity would come from a dog named Enzo? I can't say enough great things about this heart warming book. I loved Enzo. I cheered for him. I cried for him. This book is simply good for the soul.

B006AX6ONI|5.0|Mark Cuban is a Master Mind person who people can relate to because he is a self made Millionaire who is always willing to provide tips that can help you become success...just watch the shark Tank he always gives and provides recommendation.  His Book does the same...
B00GH4R95C|2.0|The first half of the movie was well done. The character development was excellent, the acting was great and the script was intelligent. Unfortunately, it just became really dumb in the second half. Very disappointed.
B00C1BHQXK|5.0|WOW, if I only had this book to read in my 20's when I got out of college and was looking at the direction to move my life and career in.  The way I look at it &#34;it's never too late&#34; to learn and begin new.  An eye opening Book for everyone who is walking this earth...if you read any book in your life this would be the one to read...POWERFUL and AMAZING what you can learn!!!
B00EGMQIJ0|4.0|Great story, but, although Dave Eggers is a great writer, this is not a very literary book, just a really interesting take on where the internet is currently headed. The progression of events in The Circle parallels trends we are seeing in sites like Google and Facebook. Eggers offers us a healthy dose of paranoia about social networks and our loss of privacy.
B00FPGSPQU|5.0|Loved this one too seen all of them and this was funny.Recommend this movie too seen it here on amoazon and might watch it again.
B00EP2PXCY|5.0|this album is your classic r&b style music. I like it because i can sing to every song  and it reminds me of old school mariah carey. im not a teeny bopper and i still like it alot. Ariana Grande has some talent! I recommend it if yo ulike your classic R&b pop balads/ dancey songs

B00CWY76CC|1.0|Its ok. All right, its down right BORING!!! No need to go into detail, game is dull, boring, very sleep inducing.<br /><br />Im getting sleepy just thinking about it......
B000XUBFE2|5.0|This book really captured WW2 from a German perspective in a wonderful way. Told by death, it was dark and careless, but also loving and sad. It was a wonderful book.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I didn't think I would be into this game but now I'm hooked. It has fun graphics and it's challenging.
B00EJU8ZIG|4.0|Heard the review on NPR while looking for homes. Played parts of the songs. Came home and bought the CD with Autorip. Well worth it and fun to listen to.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent!!  Classic Grisham...moves quickly ... Keeps your interest so you cannot put it down. It will be one of his best.
B00GD9F59S|4.0|This is the last book of the series, it &#34;kind of&#34; starts off where we were left.  It was a little slow at first to get going into it and I was getting a little worried it was going to be a disappointment like most other series out there.  (Example:  You read a series that has more than 3 books in it and you find that &#34;usually&#34; the last book is nothing but a lot of filler information about what happened in all the other books in the series plus the final closure of opened ends but not too much of that either.)  BUT,  because all of her other books are great, I decided to just hang in there a little bit to see if maybe we get more story.  I was NOT disappointed I hung in there.  This was AWESOME!!!!  In my mind, JLA did some major change up in her writing.  I got so wrapped up in the story she created, that I lost &#34;total&#34; track of time AND forgot to flipping EAT!!  lol  She also got me to actually cry.  YES!  CRY!!  Amazing writing.<br /><br />Now, I don't like to write a lot of details in my reviews about the book, but that is because I feel a little sentence of info can actually ruin the book for other readers.  (It has happened to me SOO many times that now I barely skim reviews and won't make their mistakes in mine.)  Anyhoo - you can get the jist of the story from the Blurb, but what you may not know is this:  There is action, adventure, danger, of course a love story, definitely loud mouth gasps and humor and of course heart break and so much more.  The end of the story really surprised me in many ways.  (No, this is NOT a spoiler alert here either!)  I thought it was going to end differently, quite surprised really.  And the little twists JLA put throughout the story was well done.<br /><br /> With all the good raves I am giving this book then why not 5 stars?  Sorry, the beginning drag ruined that for me.  But still, I am stressing this to all who are trying to decide if they should read the book, YES YES YES!  And if you have not readthe other books in the series yet, you need to stop right here and get those first BEFORE you read this one.  If not you &#34;will&#34; get confused and lost.  Also, I am not only recommending this book but the entire series as well.  HAPPY READING!!!
B000EF5NAS|5.0|I had seen this movie years ago.  This is one to keep in a movie library of good ones.  It is endearing, touching, humorous, sad and an all around good story.
B00499NHLC|4.0|Cumberbatch is wonderfully neurotic.  Direction is quick paced, dialogue is snappy.  I look forward to watching the rest of the series.
B00003CWNR|5.0|I saw this movie when it was first introduced.  It is heartwarming and a great story and one you will want to watch again.
B00BEZZBFO|5.0|I reserve 5 stars for truly stellar products.  I give 4 stars to great products.  THIS THING IS QUIET!!!  I replaced the Antec Tricool 120mm fan in my P183 case.  No comparison.
006202406X|1.0|As many other reviewers have said, this book is not good for many reasons.  Don't waste your time reading it.
B00BEF1AEK|5.0|Got this as AOTD and it would have been worth the $2.99! Lots of levels, good reward incentive for game replay and a familiar mechanic of launching an object (a rock, not a bird) to destroy enemies and structures (tanks not pigs) is made fun again, at least for me, by putting a new spin on it.<br /><br />Get it, get it now and you won't regret it. AOTD or not.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|perfect ending to the series... cried at the end.  you will not be disappointed in this book.  so very awesome
B00G0KY1UO|3.0|I have a kindle fire 7&quot; hd and have no issues with screen, flipping. Although I have where others haven't. Each game is different, but I digress.<br /><br />I wanted to love this game. Heck, I wanted to even like it. But to me the controls were a nuisance to get use to and it didn't seem fun enough to invest the time to get use to it. Although I did try to, several times for a while at a time. Idk, I'm probably outdone by my impatience here. Still prefer the other Regular Show Game that is available. I would recommend that for fun, easily learned and repeat FUN tablet/phone game.
B00CNQ7HAU|1.0|tedious  full of boring details  I really did not like the book  I also really hated the part about lynching
B00DYVUBYM|3.0|Like one of the reviewers  here describe, pointless. You can feel the undertone of this whole affair. These people's lives including the parents; pointless. Their lives are pointless. Especially the pretence of spiritual enlightenment. An 'old soul' obsessed with taking her own picture with her cellphone every five seconds?<br /><br />That seems harsh, but the empty heads of SoCal is brilliantly portrayed here. Self-absorbed, vain, nonsensical. Low self-esteem is loud in SoCal, including those who project seeming confidence, like the starlets themselves. While amusing, it actually shows how tragically sad that famous airheads are seen as desirable and envied. The lack of mature adults to guide their kids conveniently turn children into junkies at an early age. Is it any wonder they age so hideously by the time they're 30? Just like Hollywood in general - a circus, a wasteland of ugliness if you care to be honest. Skankiness rule here, beneath the clothes and glitter. And it gets more blatant by the day, you no longer believe that stars are so envied anymore, at least with people of good sense.<br /><br />Emma Watson is really good. She portrayed the character based on Alexis Neiers, as described in the book really well. Occasionally, her posh Brit accent can be caught, but overall, she's believable as the silly, vapid Valley girl. Leslie Mann is not my favorite actress, but she does a wonderful job as the equally ineffective and childish mother. I must say, most of the actors chosen are really gorgeous, especially Watson and Katie Chang who plays ringleader Rebecca. In the book, it keeps describing certain girls as 'beautiful' and 'pretty' and you find it's just hype to sell the story. Katie Chang is beautiful and very cool, the real Rachel Lee was a shock and Alexis Neiers and her friend Tess were actually cheap looking! As someone I know like to say, SoCal is full of trailer trash type with money and you can't take them out of their mentality - just yet.<br /><br/>Overall, it's a good wake-up call to watch this movie. It reminds just how low society have fallen in certain parts of social norm and how low standards have dropped in picking who to idolize. C'mon, be serious. Audrina Partridge?? Lindsay Lohan...?<br /><br />In the Special Features segment, Paris Hilton hits a new low. You can tell how eager she is to revive the spotlight interest in herself, letting her actual home to be used in the movie and later taking viewers on a tour of her closet and jewellery collection - just flaunting every bit - perhaps hinting that she wouldn't mind getting robbed again? After all,  she has so much stuff and they hold no real value for her; and the robbery does indicate that some silly kids still had an interest in her, and she has been a bore in the paparazzi's view these last few years. She is seen smirking throughout the needless interview here. Like her past interviews, conversation and quotes, nothing that she says make any real sense and she has no idea what she is talking about, herself.<br /><br />Thank you Sofia Coppola. This is a good portrayal overall and I was both tickled and aghast. Rent the DVD, if you don't want to buy it. It's still good for getting a regain grounded perspective after seeing the pointless focus some people can have.
B00B5HQLMI|3.0|A far cry from earlier James Bond movies, and the lead character certainly was no Sean Connery. Three stars is probably more than it deserves, but it is one of the few Amazon Prime offerings that held my interest throughout the entire movie.
0316019984|5.0|I purchased this for a 5 year old boy's birthday and he loved it.  The pop ups ad the colors are amazing.
B00EU98VVC|5.0|this album is just very good and well one. i like it from start to finnish. I have no regrets in buying this
1416905014|5.0|Absolutely beautiful pop-up!  My daughter has about 10 of the Robert Sabuda and Matthew Reinhart pop ups and this is one of my favorites.  The pages with the horses and carriage is stunning.<br />My daughter is only 6 years old and she is very careful with the books and they stay in nice condition. She actually reads them a lot and shows them to her friends. These make a great and unique gift.<br />There are just 2 things that weren't great.  We had to 'help' many of the pop ups to get them to work right the first time. And some of the pop ups were properly oriented when the book laid flat, and others were properly oriented when the book was standing up.
B00CZAYNOC|5.0|Pretty much all the songs on this cd are awesome. I've listened to it a lot since I purchased it. Looking forward to buying Vol. 2
1848507836|5.0|This is a wonderful book, I have already bought two and plan to buy more to give to my family and friends.
B00B0LPWU6|3.0|Totally unrealistic, impossible, degrading to all pilots, and degrading to blacks who have made it. Did not grab me and hold me in the plot. .
B00FRMCYQ4|5.0|it was a great family flick.  it has a good message to share.  the character's personalities were very very cute.
B00F91SCXC|4.0|I don't like zombie movies and I was hesitant to watch World war Z but I was actually surprised and really enjoyed the flick.
B00005JMX6|3.0|I got this because Timothy Olyphant was in it.  I loved him in the series Deadwood.  I am a big Justified fan.  I can't even recall this film.
0694003611|5.0|What can I say about this book, it's a classic! Great book , great price and great gift! Go get it!
B000N6TX1I|4.0|Interesting plot.  Excellent actors.  This movie was worth viewing because of the actors and the story that was different from others.
B008Q0AP2E|5.0|Great movie from a great book series and author.  Good actors and followed storyline well.  Worth a watch or two!
B00DJYJPLO|5.0|This last dvd completed this series of three for me.  I loved it.  It was the best of the trio.  Good acting.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|This whole series was well thought out and written. In this book, there were several unexpected developments. The ending did not disappoint!
B002CIY8EM|4.0|Very interesting and makes alot of sense.  Examples and testimonies help out the case for life on other planets.  Does not insult my intellegence or Christian faith.
B00EVW0SA0|1.0|Predictable, boring and Channing Tatum is unbelievable as the hero.  Ridiculous action scenes.  Quips made by Jamie Foxx as president are silly and out of place.  This is a pitiful knock off of the excellent move 'White House Down'.
B00E9A656K|2.0|Maybe its too soon but there is nothing exciting about this game...but I'm really not a gamer, I love cars and car games.
B00CWV8TIU|1.0|Slow and boring.  Advertised as being suspenseful but that is only true if you can stay awake long enough until the last thirty minutes.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Amazing show! It gets better with each episode. The characters as well as the plot are well developed. Stay off of blogs about this show! Too many spoilers out there
B000003CM9|4.0|First album from the prototypical Southern Rock band.  Complex melodies, harmonies and rhythms.  Holds up well year after year after year.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Allegiant was a hard read for me. I feel it wasn't as well written as the first two, and it was hard to get in to. The dual POV was disconcerting, as the two voices sound so much alike. There were times that I had to go back to the beginning of a chapter to confirm who was speaking.<br /><br />But, when you get past the way it's written, it is a decent end to the story. I'll admit to having a hard time dealing with the ending- it just felt so unnecessary. But, after re-reading it (and reading VR's blog post about it), I'm ok with it. I might even say I like it. It's not your traditional happily-ever-after, but it is an ending that our beloved Tris deserves.
B000AM6OQ2|4.0|Good acting in a good old fashioned ghost story.  This film hasn't held up quite so well as some others from the same period but worth a watch.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I was a bit skeptical at first about a movie based on magic but it turned out to be an entertaining movie with a plot that keeps you guessing. I would recommend adding to your watchlist.
B000GCFO0I|4.0|I think this is a good scare picture.  Plenty of reviews out there already, so I won't elaborate. A few truly unsettling scenes, so not for children.
B00F91H666|4.0|I'm not a huge zombie or brad Pitt fan but this movie turned out to be quite good. Without. Giving away the plot, you can tell this movie is set up for a sequel but I'll probably see that as well. Good acting and special effects.
B00F91SCXC|3.0|The movie is ok but a little weak.  Pitt's character getting impaled by a piece of metal during a plane crash and then walking great distances was quite a stretch.  I heard there is a sequel coming.  Not too bad for a .99 rental.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|Best show on TV  , Just imagine when they make a  Walking Dead Movie. AMC TV is doing shows in house now .. get ready
B00BETX5PS|5.0|Super action movie!  The last James Bond movie I watched was a dud.  After seeing this one I wished I had purchased instead of rented.
B006LSZECO|3.0|The characters were very unlikeable.  The plot twist at the end was good, but overall it was a slow read and just not great.
B00D6BU8GG|4.0|I have been a fan of Bruce for years.  This movie plot involves John's son and is a decent flick.
B00G32TD98|5.0|As a big fan of &#34;scary&#34; movies The Conjuring proved to be a great choice for the evening.  I really enjoyed the movie.
B009FZHYKU|5.0|My kids love this series and are totally addicted to it.  The series gets into some very interesting interpersonal relationships.
B009HEMF1M|5.0|This is one of my favorite movies and R.E.D. 2 is just as good. I saw it in the theater and rented it on \\"On Demand\\", several times. It's that good. I give it 10 full stars !
B0093QHWLC|4.0|The acting is terrific.  I am a big fan of Sean Penn and this role fit him to a tee.  Both Kevin Bacon and Tim Robbins were dead on in interpreting their respective roles.  The direction by Clint Eastwood kept the action flowing smoothly through out the picture.  The story demonstrates how taking violent action without all of the facts can lead to terrible decisions and that violence can not be taken back.  It sort of reminds me of the message of Unforgiven also a Clint Eastwood movie.
B003G4W49C|4.0|Good leadership lessons, among other things.  Definitely worth the read and thoughtful analysis, especially at 360 pages.  Suggested reading for any age and profession.
B004RJMUJO|5.0|Fun and good portable practice for kids who want Ninja training (with fruit) according to my ten year old son.
B00632HWOG|5.0|I have had Yahoo for close to 10 years and have never experienced any issues. On rare occasions it may take a little longer but overall it has been a great experience. I often use Yahoo's email as a backup for communicating with students. I highly recommend them.
B00DYVESVO|5.0|great story. I am not going to critic the relevant info and the character portrayal, or whether it was true to storyline and plot. I just enjoyed reading it, and giving myself a little bit of time out of the day to relax.
B00992CF6W|5.0|According to my grandson who I purchased this for this is the greatest app. He is creating on this app for more time than my daughter would like him too..although she does limit his game time she admits it is a good app. Keeps you mind thinking..
B00B0LPYXG|2.0|Unnecessary nudity and way to much foul language. With out those other things it would have been a good movie.
B007IXWL2C|5.0|Great Series of books...great author..hopefully she continues the story line someday..Looking forward to the movie..This series has really been popular
B000000LZV|5.0|i feel compelled to pile on here<br /><br />the best album ever recorded.<br /><br />ever.<br /><br />really.<br /><br />i must look like a dork
B008XG1X18|5.0|LOVE LOVE LOVE....great app...I can spend hours on Pinterest..very easy to get around what you are looking for. I have used so many ideas for parties and just doing home repaire ideas.
B00F91SCXC|1.0|It was incredibly boring.  So bad!!  Not sure why I watched the entire movie.  Brad's acting was wooden and there was so little tension.  Brad's hopping around the globe in search of a mysterious 'cure' that turns out to be making oneself sick?  The movie was just dumb.
B00846REIS|5.0|OMG this series is the best...I would read the Crossfire story line forever...Sylvia Day is a great author. I look forward to the next book in line for this series
B003G4W49C|5.0|love the book, just wish it took longer than 6 hours to read. I will definitely be reading the next in this series.
B002GHHHP6|5.0|What's not to love---James Garner, Mel Gibson and Jodie Foster---great movie, super-fast delivery!  that's all i have to say about this
B0093LFGL0|5.0|I went to his concert in June 2013 in Manchester England. Now I live in California USA He stole the show. I have been a true and loyal fan of his for the past 17 years. What more can I say..
0062101897|5.0|This book is amazing!  We saw it in England at the Harry Potter Studio Tour and bought it online instead of dragging it all over.  It is great for all of us Harry Potter fans!  It really gives a great in depth look at the films!
B005D9MUWY|5.0|Easily the best typing app That I have ever used on my android device. I've used this app on my Galaxy S2 as well as my Galaxy S4 and it helps me save so many key strokes and mistakes that it's insane. Once the app gets used to certain words that might be unique to you and your texting style, it begins to predict what you type and it's correct approximately 80% of the time. I've recommended this app to tons of friends.
B00FAX6XQC|4.0|how does it work when I play it it randomly askew me to force close maw god please. help a gamer in need
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Well written, humorous and engaging. You are immediately caught up in this story while seeing life through his quirky mind.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|A disappointing end to a great first book. Plot was undeveloped and confusing. Would no longer recommend this series to others.
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|All my friends have been playing Candy Crush and tell me I have to play.  It's great!  It's awesome! It's fun!  So I was told.  I do NOT share these same feelings. Positive comments- the game is colorful, cute illustrations, interesting music.  The first 10 levels are very easy and you advance to next level easily.<br /><br />After that, levels/boards are much harder and extremely frustrating. You can be stuck on one level for days. I like a challenging game but this is ridiculous. Also, I've noticed that the level's board changes with every replay. It's not like you are getting a chance to change some of the moves you made in the previous game. It is very frustrating. It is not my idea of fun or enjoyment.<br /><br />Also, the game initially provides you with \\"gold bars & special boosters\\" to help you. However, once you've used your free gold bars & boosters, you cannot get more unless you pay for them with real money. I am NOT going to spend money to play this game! Another thing I don't like is that you only get 5 lives per game session. Once you've lost your 5 lives, you cannot play again for a certain period of time. Why should I have to wait 30 minutes or an hour or more to continue playing? And again here, you can skip the wait and buy more lives for $.<br /><br />The last thing I dislike about this game is the Facebook \\"share\\" aspect of it.  Ask your friends for help. Ask your friends to send you extra moves or an extra life.  Share with your friends that you conquered a level etc. No, I don't want to ask my friends. No, I don't want to boast that I beat my friends' score; I JUST WANT TO PLAY A GAME FOR MY OWN FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT AND I WANT TO PLAY WHEN I HAVE THE TIME TO PLAY.  I don't want to be told \\"you can't play anymore now, come back later!\\".
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Wonderfully written story with wonderful characters. Although this is a book about children with cancer, it is smart, witty, and engaging.  It's more a story about living than dying. Insightful and charming.
B00GINENG0|5.0|It's so adorable!!!! It's just like if you had own your own pet Tom Cat!!!!<br /> Your little ones will love it!!!!
B0049P1VHS|5.0|Love the show and being able to watch where ever I want to. The family likes to watch the show too.
B0013FSL3E|4.0|Even though the undertone of this movie is all about GREEN, and saving the planet.. I can't help but love it. I even love the fact that there are not alot of WORDS in this movies.. Mostly music, and sound effects. Great overall movie
B005LAJ22Q|5.0|Can't go wrong with a series the whole family will watch. This is an eventful season. Sad to see some characters go.
B004U8VX2M|4.0|I started watching this because this is the precursor to Downton Abby. And i have read the books by Margaret Powell which really started all these shows. They are great. I found this series to be somewhat slow at times.. but Have enjoyed it as I have continued through with all the seasons. You come to know the characters as you would your own families..
B008Y2FRFO|2.0|Boring...how exciting can it be to try and line up coins to get them to tumble over the edge? Deleted this one really quickly!
B003SI9WYG|4.0|The movie is a classic that we watch every year at Halloween. This year we were traveling and decided to go for Amazon streaming video and were disappointed with slow buffering and freeze frames during the movie but the film itself was great.
B00EDO1YRM|4.0|My grandson requested this movie, and we really enjoyed watching it together.  I had seen it years ago.  Just the kind of adventure a little kid likes without being &#34;dark&#34; like Batman.
B000I9U99K|4.0|If the object of a naval officer is to &#34;Choose the lesser of two weevils&#34; then this movie fails because it is not the lesser of anything! A very well done adaptation of a C.S. Forester book
B002EX5M6S|5.0|This is a great spy thriller.  I had seen it before, but I enjoyed it more this time noticing some things about the story line that I may have missed before.  I really enjoyed it.  Good movies don't need lots of special effects to entertain.
B000HZD168|5.0|This is the best Star Trek Movie hands down. It is probably one of the top 5 sci-fi films ever made. It helps if you have seen the episode of the original series it is a continuation of but even without that it is still just a great, really fun escapist film.
076115728X|5.0|great book to remind you that every mistake can turn into something beautiful! i don't know who likes it more- me or my kids!
B004DBU0UW|5.0|Well the film messed with the time line of some things but this the movie that you either love or hate. If you haven't seen it you need to see it at least once
B005MLOKXA|4.0|Loved the first season, but find the 2nd grosser and less interesting.  Still good acting and fairly interesting plotline.  Is there clean TV left to be found?
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book is well written and is written in a different format.  It is an intriguing, humanistic story during Hitler's reign. Fast reading, I couldn't put it down!!
B00FKAA3MA|4.0|Wicked album from shady, no doubt the his best work since The Eminem Show and its better then that. I'm not a big eminem fan but shady pulled a rabbit out his hat on this one, you can pretty much let this one ride all the way through without skipping much. Bad Guy, Rhyme or Reason, Legacy, Love Game going to be in heavy rotation for a while along with many more songs. Album a must Listen.
B007BFSYMS|5.0|This is a great product! TMSoft is a great company. Lots of good customer service and when he adds sounds (which he does all the time) he either gives them too you free or really inexpensive. For some reason he thinks that people sleep on the bridge of the Starship Enterprise though...
B00755MHXG|5.0|One of the most beautiful books I have read...started on a Saturday morning and didn't stop until I'd finished later that day! It's a MUST read!
B00B7Y0206|4.0|I think I'll use this a lot. I'm enjoying it! had great fun with the site yesterday. What's not to like?
B007B5EDEG|5.0|I love it. Great characters, well written. Has kept me engaged and wanting to just sit and read.  Pity that I can't :(
1250038820|4.0|A rare and wonderful backstage view of the people that make the city - funny, evocative, exciting, and romantic. City life - as you've never seen it before. A treasure.
1439181780|5.0|fast  shipping<br />good  product  good  price<br />would  be  a  good  g ift  . i ordered it  for  my  sister  for  christmas<br />she  asked  for it
B004GNFSO0|5.0|Incredible story of an incredible true journey. Inspiring and entertaining. You may not be able to put it down. Under rated and under praised.
B00BRUQ7ZY|5.0|So many insights into the life and times of Jesus.  Also, it answered so many questions I have always had about the words used in scripture.  Now it all makes sense.
B000B8QF00|1.0|I love the collection.  However, I wanted to upload it to my computer, but, it was garbled.  It only plays on my stereo - which is very limiting.  If I had know that, I would have bought the CD on itunes.  I like having my music everywhere, not just in the stereo.  Now, I will have to order the CD through itunes as well - double pay!  :-(
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|Cool and the animals have realistic deaths! But a couple bugs need to be fixed .Amazingly High graphics lol and nice
B00BD99JMW|1.0|This series had a lot of potential.  I LOVED Divergent. I read most of it on an early morning cross country flight. I couldn't put it down and completely missed my opportunity for a nap before a long work conference.<br />As much as I loved Divergent, I was disappointed in Insurgent.  It was so repetitive and the faction system...it was suddenly overly simplistic and completely absolute, but at the same time too confusing for the characters to understand (ex. Dauntless goes to Amity for shelter because they're the nice and caring faction. They ask them to fight with them. They say no. Minds are blown! Seriously?). Tris takes a page from the Bella Swan handbook and keeps trying to sacrifice herself for Four. And the end is a complete rip off of the end of the Firefly movie.<br />I thought Allegiant would go back to its Divergent roots but it was more the exact same repetitive crap about the factions. Snooze. It's obvious Roth didn't have enough materials for three books...and I feel a little bad for her.  We're in an phase where every book seemingly HAS to be part of a trilogy and this just should have been a stand alone book.<br />This was one of a handful of books that I just couldn't even bring myself to finish (confession: I did read spoilers to determine if it was worth it. I know how it goes and how it ends and I repeat: SNOOZE). And based on the reviews here (more 1&2 stars than 4&5 stars), I made a good choice.
B0089LOG02|5.0|The characters come alive in this beautifully constructed story of two girls following  similar paths, generations apart .  Even the places come to life with beautiful descriptions of time and fashion.  I highly recommend this book and author.
B000N2HBSO|5.0|One of my favorite books of all time, and one of my very favorite characters of all history.  Thank you Ms. Kearns Goodwin for doing the massive research on this amazing man.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|The book dealt historically with Jesus the man & the times in which he lived.  It was well written, informative but at times repetitive.  When in college, years ago, I took course in comparative religions as well as a literature course about the Bible as literature and comparing it to what we now call myths.  Now, these types of courses are no longer politically correct.  Zealot fills a void in our reading historical facts about Jesus the man.  It also makes us consider how various religions change information to fill the needs of the people as well as the Churches interests as well.
B00063EMJ6|5.0|Great album
0385350864|4.0|I loved Mad About the Boy every bit as much as I enjoyed Bridget Jones’s Diary and even more than I liked The Edge of Reason.<br />Bridget is at her best in Helen Fielding’s latest installment—even more vulnerable, equally hilarious, every bit as likely to find herself up S***s Creek without a paddle. Bridget is facing a mid-life crisis of magnanimous proportions. For four years, she’s been grieving the loss of her husband, Mark Darcy, while catering to the constant demands of her two small children. It’s time for Bridget to move on with her life. For the sake of her children, she must find a way to be happy. What Bridget really needs is sex, a man to hold her during the lonely nights. What she doesn’t expect to find is Roxster, a 29-year-old Toy Boy whom she discovers in the twitterverse. Bridget experiences a whole new world of dating, the delights and disasters of texting and twitting.<br />In addition to her never-ending battle with the bathroom scales, Bridget finds herself coping with the normal issues every mother of young children faces—head lice, stomach flu, coordinating the chaotic schedules of active children. Only the misadventures are all the funnier when they happen to Bridget. And, in true Bridget style, her catastrophes are not all related to children. Bridget is a middle-aged, born-again virgin, reconnecting with her sexuality and experiencing new romance for the first time in a decade.<br />I can’t recommend this novel highly enough. I would give Bridget Jones ten stars if I could, for her passion and her spontaneity, for her dogged determination. What sets this novel apart from the previous two episodes of Bridget Jones are the children. Regardless of what happens in Bridget’s love life, she always puts her children first. At the risk of spoiling the surprise, Mad About the Boy ends in a very satisfying way, although, sadly, I don’t see much room for a sequel.
B005LAIIHG|1.0|Long, lame movie!  I'm sure many people would not agree with me, but, ugh!!!  Don't know what I expected, but, my son & husband felt the same way.  It is very well made, but, just boring.  Plus, I really hate seeing animals die.  :o(
B00280LYIM|5.0|Very good book. Lots of action and a little romance to go along with it. My favorite characters are Annabeth and Percy. Definitely read this book.
B000ICRKLM|5.0|More great storylines and character acting.  Very well done series, still enjoying it immensely!  I highly recommend to sci-fi genre fans.
B005CRQ3RK|4.0|It was only ok because it was not the best Diary Of a Wimpy kid. It could of been better
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|Works great and gives me a view to my calendar and other items just as I would expect... Glad I installed it.
B00FAPF5U0|3.0|It's alright.  I would enjoy it more if there were options to play continuously rather than to have buy more lives & boosters. Chose to uninstall.
B00GBCMW9S|4.0|Eminem did it again!!! There is a reason why he is the best. I bought Kanye, Jayz, J cole Drakes album but there was nothing that made me go WOW on it. This album has a magnificient start middle and ending. Yes i know it isn't old eminem that what we saw on the first three albums but it is a album that beats any rap album that has come out this year. His way of words are not as good like in the eminem show but it still tingles your ear drums. His phyco side isnt as crazy and in the slim shapy lp but it still makes you go WHATT!!! His deepnes in his words is not that as the MLP1 but he is a differnt man. Like he said a adapater he can adjust. You get tired of hearing about rappers talking about money, girls, weeds, and STARTED FROM THE BOTTOM. But you can't get tired of rap that show all emotion: sadness, happiness, just plain angry, forgivness etc. This isn't eminem best work but this is a master piece that beats recovery, and kills relapce Encore.
B0083P1QUM|4.0|I read all the Scarpetta novels. This one, typically well written, was unique in that it doesn't spend all that much time referring back to previous behavior of the recurring characters.
B0091VYG86|5.0|I love the simplicity of the story line. Talking about prejudices, oppression, and other social issues in a funny family way. I have used line from this movie for years. It is a re watcher for me.
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|So addicted to this series! Love the law-yet personal issues. Our favorite show as a family!! Trust me...You will love it!
B001F6ZIXW|5.0|if you like motorcycles, leather, sexy and badass men AND women, blood n guts, and blowing shit up.... this series is for you. as a female, I am surprisingly into all of this and I find myself wishing I was jax's old lady in SAMCRO.. no surprise there. these guys don't stand for b.s. and, although not in the most conventional way, they take care of their own.. no matter what. I love that
B004JY0KP8|5.0|Looks great.  Son loves it.  Got it for his 18th birthday.  No complaints about the white hands on white face, but it is also the first watch he has worn almost daily.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|This is the best invention since the iPhone! Small, unbelievably affordable and very easy to install. I have used my Netflix program much more now that I have this device. I love things that make my life easier and this has. Thank you Google.
B00F3VOL38|5.0|This CD is most interesting for what you don't expect.  There are songs not on any other albums, and great pieces of interviews.  You will hear the Beatles as they were at the beginning.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was very disappointed in this conclusion to the trilogy. Every Divergent fan will want to read it, but I wish I hadn't. I felt no connection to the storyline or the characters besides Tris. I felt like the Four's character wasn't really true to who he was in the previous books.<br />The ending was done right.......but getting there felt like a chore.
B00BRUQ7ZY|4.0|This book seeks truth about a time where there wasn't much written.  Aslan takes some of the scriptures where he has little or no choice and makes sensible conclusions.
B008K9SG9K|3.0|Overall the album is okay. I think it's fair to say that the second half (or even 2/3) of the album sounds very different from the beginning section which contains Demons and Radioactive. I don't think I would have purchased the album knowing what the latter half of it sounds like, but there are 2-3 more songs that are good.
B0064TVQ5E|5.0|It is very addicting and challenging. I like to play to relax and is great for car trips, I don't get bored.
B00991TCOG|5.0|A beautiful album from a very talented young woman. I heard a few songs of hers and decided to buy the cd and I'm so glad I did. She's wonderful, and now she has another big fan of her music!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|It was a little frustrating but, overall good. I wasn't expecting the ending, which I guess is good but i was hoping for something else.
B000GPIPSS|5.0|Classic horror at its best..a must for vampire fans. This is a nice addition to any collection. Picture quality is very good.
B0054JZC6E|5.0|I love this game it is so awesome I play it like every day I am on the games that cost me 20000 and yeah it is really fun.
B000SVZIGC|5.0|This is a gift for my daughter so I haven't watched yet. The case is sealed, and looks to be in perfect condition. But the shipping was amazingly fast!! It was on my door step less than 26 hours after I ordered! Great job!!
B008Y7N7JW|5.0|I forgot how good this movie was. Full of action, suspense and romance. Can't wait for Catching Fire next week
B007IXWKUK|5.0|This book was exciting, emotional and sexy as hell!!!! These characters bring you on a journey of extreme fantasy. Can't wait to read the next one!
B0083ZBW2Y|4.0|This book is very different from your average novel. There's very little dialoge  because the main character is a dog. The book is 90% imagery and story telling. Which Jack London does very well
B007EC27QM|5.0|I use this calculator almost daily.  So handy and has big letters.<br />I recommend this to everybody, who use math daily.
B00CT6EJEG|5.0|Great movie, great actors and wonderful locations.<br />One is compelled to be an accomplish to a sociopath, something difficult to do. Ripley is a fantastic character.
B004DLPXAO|1.0|The app did not work on my phone, home computer, or any other device that I have. I downloaded this app, because I purchased my textbook for school and now Kindle does not work. My home computer is too new (Windows 8), my android phone does not support the app and my tablet couldn't open it. What a waste of time and I bought my book for the convenience, so the app does not serve my needs.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I Loved it.  A little shocking at the end! Hope she writes another trilogy for all to enjoy her work!
B008Y7N7JW|3.0|I am almost always of the opinion that the book is better.  The Hunger Games is no exception.  I initially read the book because I couldn't understand how something with such a grim plot line could be so popular with kids.  I ended up reading and enjoying the entire series.  Although the Hunger Games movie does stay true to the book, it seems like certain things were added only because they appeared in the book and didn't really have a place in the film adaptation.  That said, it is still worth watching.  However, if you have not read the book, parts of the movie may seem confusing at times.
B006O6F932|5.0|FOLLOW THE DIRECTIONS!<br />You will enjoy this toy much better if u follow ALL of the directions that are shown on the paper pamphlet that comes in the box.<br />This school is wider than the picture looks and needs to be on the floor or a flat and stable surface.<br />1. The doors are easier to attach than I thought at first.<br />2. The &#34;stone&#34; pillars help the school stay upright, so keep them on even if the gargoyles fall off.<br />3.The stickers don't actually need to go anywhere, so stick them wherever :)
B0061JPYX2|5.0|I am not sure how I feel about this gal. When she is not paring up with some rapper this girl can jazz with the best of them. This is a really good album
B000QCQ8Y4|5.0|My wife and I recommend Jim Cavierzel who plays John Reese in 'Person of Interest' to play Reacher rather than Tom Crews.
B001QFZADA|5.0|Thought the book had valid points and easy to understand and try. Very informative and will pass it along to others to read.
B00E6Z0THE|5.0|Great story and artwork. Played this with my 8 year old and we loved it. No HO's (yay). They really worked hard on this game. Different than most and the type of game I would like to see more of. Played on Kindle HD.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|This is a wonderful story and enjoyable reading adventure.  It is one of those rare books that you don't want to end.
B00FGFVMGA|5.0|Pretty cool point and click with nice artwork. This game was hard to put down. No HO's a bonus. Played on Kindle HD.
B0063IH60K|4.0|I love this app. I have used the same one for years with my iPhone and now I'm using it on an Android. The app worked perfectly on my iPhone however I am noticing some minor glitches with the app on the Android. If I hadn't had years of flawless use with the app then I wouldn't have noticed anything was off with the Android's app which is why I'm giving this 4 stars instead of 5.
B00A6CCF0K|4.0|As always, well written.  Doctor Sleep was a great story and I couldn't wait to turn each page.  It doesn't touch the original The Shinning in the horror department but it reflects an author at a different stage in his life.  I always look forward to his next book.  I am already waiting for the next one.  So what is next, Mr. King?<br />Just don't bring the clown back to life.  I don't think I could take it.
B0026IUXME|5.0|To find humanity amidst the nightmare of insanity, and, the willingness to sacrifice so this single talented man could carry the truth<br />out to the world with his music is truely amazing. One cannot help but feel overwealmed with emotion.<br />Viet-nam Vet, disabled, i'm not easily moved. But, this film touched me deeply.
B0055MBQOM|5.0|Works very well.  Easy to use.  Easy to set up.  Once it is set up, the unit adjust's your screen's settings based on the current room lighting.
B00AEFXXMI|5.0|A classic feel good movie with a great soundtrack! If you need a pick me upper, this is the one.
B00340ESIS|5.0|Though I haven't read many (if any) other books on screen-writing I'm inclined to believe their claim of STC being the last book you'll ever need.  The tricks, tidbits, processes and insider points of view in here that open your eyes are absolutely golden, and buying your own copy, I promise it's going to get dog-eared fast (unless it's the Kindle version).  It's also important to note that Save the Cat is not just for screen writers but anyone that wants to tell a story, regardless of medium.  A wonderfully invaluable tool to keep by your side.
B007FG9LIE|5.0|Awesome!! What a great story, a page turner. Read it last weekend, you won't be able to put it down!
B006FK7SZ4|4.0|The only thing about it keeps asking me to update it every time I use the app on my kindle.  But it's a fun way to meet new people and fined your friends too.
B00BEZTMFY|5.0|I watch The Hobbit: Unexpected Journey over and over again. It takes you on a small adventure that you always seem to enjoy.
B001XV3LSS|4.0|Although some of the acting is a little flat, it has an interesting story line and decent graphics. Lots of political intrigue and an honest portrayal of how humans (and their governments) would probably act given the same events that occurred in the movie.
B005H9B44A|5.0|Just for Thor's hair... This movie is a lot of fun and good to watch again before seeing part two.
B007SGLZP8|5.0|An enjoyable book from start to finish with a great ending. It held my attention and was a page turner.
B008TRUDAS|5.0|Great read it was funny romantic, and definitely had me at tears at timea . Would definitely recommend to all.
B006LSZECO|5.0|Had never read this author before and was pleasantly surprised.  This book hooks you and pulls you in,  lots of twists and turns.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|I really enjoyed The Husband's Secret. I flew through it trying to predict and relished the surprises in the end. The author leaves off with a valuable reminder that &#34;what if's&#34; are not productive lines of thought. The various characters have depth and readers will find themselves identifying with them in difficult situations. It's not an emotionally easy read, but worth your time. I highly recommend.
B00F0O8SZK|5.0|This CD is a wonderful Christmas addition to my collection.  Susan's voice is clear and beautiful.  She sings traditional Christmas songs as well as bringing some new songs.  The duet with Elvis singing &#34;Oh Come All You Faithful&#34; is wonderful as well as the Little Drummer Boy song with a section of drums and bagpipes gave me chills just listening to songs.  You will not be disappointed in this CD as it is a relaxing and provides a positive mood to any setting.  I bought several of the CD's to give as gifts.
B00FJTYDKK|5.0|Watched this with my family and we all loved it. It kept my kids' attention and got laughs from everyone!
B00BSBR9N6|5.0|Loved this book! So clever and funny. Makes one understand and have compassion for individuals who are &#34;different&#34; and to then realize they're happy in their own skin.
B009XIXVU6|5.0|Very interesting the way the author exposes us to moral complexity and sacrifices in our lives.  Although a bit confusing at times because of all the characters it was an interesting read and very discussable for our book group.  Just know in advance it is like nine separate stories that are tied together in the end.  Enjoy the read
B000FBJAEG|5.0|This is the beginning of the working relationship of King and Maxwell. . .the one that tells how they got together.  I don't know whether other readers enjoy the adventures of characters that you get to know through &#34;serial&#34; novels but I enjoy following the escapades of characters that you get to know.  I enjoyed the adventures of Mitch Rapp and continue to look forward to the challenges faced by Scott Harvath by different authors.  I enjoyed meeting the Baldacci's characters, Shawn King and Michelle Maxwell, and have also finished reading one of their following adventures, First Family, which I would also recommend.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|Set up is so easy. You can connect it  to any TV provided it has an HDMI plug. The only set back right now is that there are only a limited number of apps to choose from. Hopefully, they will work on this fast enough and they will extend their range of choices to even international entertainment apps. Looking forward to this
B002SSUQFG|5.0|The watch arrived properly packaged on the date promised. This was a USED product, but was in excellent condition with no discernible damage or scratches. Has kept perfect time and is exactly as was pictured on the website.
B00E3IZIM0|5.0|A must watch movie, I didn't even move. I pre-ordered this movie a while back ago and I just loved it!
B00065MDS6|5.0|I use this album as a reference source for testing assorted listening devices. It's so well produced, and jumps through a galaxy of genres, instruments, dynamic shifts, frequencies, etc. - all in a wild 42 min. ride. Right now I'm testing some $7 Panasonic earbuds someone turned me on to. Guess what? They're passing the test with flying colors(!). Also, Lizard is one of the very best prog rock albums there is (IMO). Hats off to Fripp & Co.
B00B52FDXQ|5.0|This is the best season for me, too bad!  This is also the last season and I am going to miss it.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|AWESOME!  John Grisham books always take me out of a reading slump and Sycamore Row was no exception... loved it cover to cover.
B00464AVXW|3.0|Acting was great, the story was slow. It used historical literature in an attempt to make the characters seem &#34;deep&#34; and &#34;intellectual.&#34;<br /><br />Kevin Spacey was superb. The ending was well done. Just watch the last 15 minutes and that's about all that's worthwhile.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Interesting ending to the trilogy...surprising twist with the heroes at the end.  Good read for teens and adults; interesting perspective and commentary on human behavior and nature
1594484805|5.0|Daniel Pink presents great information that definitely gets you thinking and talking about leadership practices and the role many businesses have adopted. Watch the RSA animated version of his speech Drive online, it will give you a good basis as to what this book will be discussing.<br /><br />I enjoyed the book (assigned for an administration graduate class).
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Nobody does it better!  The master of this genre strikes again.  Drawing upon A Time To Kill, Grisham returns readers to the racial tensions of the 1960s and to the life of Jake Brigance as he deals with his notoriety as a trial lawyer.  The plot is pure Grisham - clear and engaging and sculpted like a bobsled track.  I think I love Grisham most because I can never out guess him.  This is a great read!
B000I3UMKM|5.0|A wonderful film and a definite that everyone should watch! Audrey Hepburn is a dream in this movie and will leave you wanting to watch it again and again!
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|I wanted to like this book, but it just kept getting more and more depressing with every page.  At the end, I was just flipping through the pages trying to get through it.  I eventually got tired of the characters and didn't even finish the book.
B00D7Z4GQY|4.0|Great book, very interesting. Sparked off a few great debates in our house! about ' what would you do?' I enjoyed the ending too, it was interesting reading how things would have turned out.
B00BMVTS1S|5.0|As a fan of both &#34;The Hobbit&#34; and &#34;The Lord of the Rings&#34; trilogy, I really fell in love with the way this movie depicted the characters and scenery I had imagined while reading the book. Right on par with the trilogy in my opinion!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Great game. I have always loved Castleville. This is a very fun game.<br />Great graphics and runs well. Since its free you can't go wrong!!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Best!!  Don't want it to end! Perhaps this will be a movie that will make Stephen King happy and I can't wait to see it
B0019IB0II|4.0|I liked it.  The book is clearly written.  Includes essential information regarding the structures of the brain as related to stroke.  I especially liked how she discusses the left and right brain functions and interactions in the later chapters. I have been afraid of having a stroke.  This book enabled me to let go of that fear. How to relate to someone who has had a stroke was also valuable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another successful project.... always meets my expectations.I have never been disappointed in his work.His writing just flows so smoothly.. thanks
B001FB5634|5.0|Think things could not get any worse?<br />This helps show that, in a way.. I have to keep reminding  myself<br />that this is a movie and that is why the kids grew up so fast...<br /><br />Get ready, this could happen.... remember the black death, little ice age,<br />and other times in the past... If it happened once, it could and WILL happen again..<br /><br />When?
B0042VJ1PI|4.0|I am a fan of Castle and it was great to see what all the hype was with The Heat Series.
039916409X|5.0|I'm into tapping & Margaret really guides you thru all the blocks that many of us experience, or might not even be aware that we have, & the accompanying videos are great & I'm already beginning to feel some shifts which is AMAZING!
B008CX2A2I|4.0|Works great with my Onkyo TX-NR616 receiver. Very easy to use. Immediately hooks up to my iPhone 5s and I control my music  selection from the phone. Sound quality is very good.
B00DJFIMW6|5.0|This game is so much fun to play you can play it on the go or just sit at home and play it
B006LSZECO|5.0|This book deserves 5 stars because it kept me turning the pages and I really enjoyed reading it.<br />This book deserves 4 stars because it was just so frustrating to read.<br />I'd recommend to people who like to read about the worst people on the planet.
B00BEF1AEK|1.0|It is a horrible game<br />I will never play it again Ps never ever play it again in my life
B0069JBKHI|3.0|For the most part, this monitor is great. However, I have noticed a significant amount of down time... (connectivity issues) and we had to move it out of our baby's sight since the infrared light can be too disturbing in the middle of the night - hence we now can't really see her face.<br />We still use it and it has the potential of being great, but the connectivity issues are a real bummer.
B00AGOGOLE|5.0|I love this app because in kindle fire there is no video and this is just perfect. You should definitely get this.
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|Awesome, use it a lot. Tab Cast With Google Chrome makes this worth every penny alone. I use it from an iPad, android phone and Win7 laptop.
B00ESB6GBY|5.0|Will Always Love This Show!!!!! Gonna Miss My Boy Barney and Marshall! But Love you all!<br /><br />HIMYM Rocks!!!!!!!!!!! Wish We Could Have More Seasons!!
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|I always enjoy reading John Grisham,  I had the feeling he threw this one together quickly.  It was a fast read with the usual twists & turns.  However he had several characters that were 66 years old.  He seemed fixated on that age.  And they were all referred to as Senior Citizens.  What world is he living in?  Also redundant was waitresses or hosts constantly &#34;topping off&#34; the coffee.  These little things just keep popping out at me, making me feel there was not a lot of editing.  As I said in the beginning, I felt it was written quickly to meet a deadline rather than attention to detail.<br />Because of that, I was disappointed.
B003XF1XOQ|5.0|I just want curl up in a ball and cry, but I can't seem to find my tears, I guess it's because I'm happy of how it turned out...Despite my sensitive personal emotions, this book was magnificent. I can't think of a better ending to a perfect series.
0316322407|5.0|Christmas Gift. This is a gift for my grand daughter. It should be an inspiration for a young woman.  A winner!
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I love this bo<br />ok so much!!! I wish they would make another one!!!!I love this book so much and that's it.
B008KYOCA2|5.0|Jorte Calendar is the best calendar app I've found.  Personalized, it is &#34;my calendar&#34; just the way I like it.  Besides that, it's fun, fast and easy.
0071762345|5.0|The book is in good condition and arrived very quickly. Great read so far, very valuable for starting out in social media!
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|I have been a great fan of John Grisham and have read every one of his books.  I have always felt that &#34;A Time to Kill&#34; was his very best and I have enjoyed watching the movie time after time.  I was looking forward to Sycamore Row and thorougly enjoyed reading about the old characters, visualizing them from the movie, and looked forward to seeing this book made into a movie (hopefuilly with the same actors playing their old roles).  However, I was quite disappointed in reading this new book.  The plot line was predictable and the ending totally lacking in credibility.  Although the brother's statement shows a plausible reason for leaving the bulk of the estate to Lettie, there was not a single fact presented to give credibility to the notion that the bequest to Lettie was made with (1) knowledge that she was the daughter of the man whom his family participated in hanging and then in takng his land, nor (2) that the bequest was made to right this wrong (as opposed to it being due to her undue influence, or any other reason).
B007QA3AH2|5.0|great cast and funny spoof on space adventures. Tim Allen et all are great. Special effects are good . no brainer for relation
B00EVW04PE|4.0|Funny and action packed. Don't come looking for a period of instruction on the way it is really done. Just a fun movie.
1856697525|4.0|Elegant as its subject and a terrific overview of his career.  For me, it falls just short of a 5 star rating because in the movie<br />section devoted to Bass, it omits some of the rarest trade ads he designed for such movies as ONE TWO THREE, THE<br />LOUDEST WHISPER aka THE CHILDREN'S HOUR, and NINE HOURS TO RAMA--along with various movie trade ads he<br />did for SOME LIKE IT HOT, ATTACK, and others.  Also, I wish there were more about Bass's inner-workings with directors<br />like Billy Wilder, Otto Premenger, Alfred Hitchcock, John Frankenheimer, etc.
0446618322|5.0|On time and great quality book purchased used but looks like new ! I was impressed best price on here
B00EIBO8UK|5.0|For the past decade, &#34;Love Actually&#34; has been a staple in our household during the holidays, right alongside Holiday classics like &#34;It's a Wonderful Life&#34;; &#34;Christmas in Connecticut&#34;; &#34;Miracle on 34th Street&#34; (1942) and more recent classics such as &#34;Planes, Trains and Automobiles&#34; and &#34;A Christmas Story&#34;.<br /><br />The cast is perfect! Even the supporting actors have made a name for themselves during this decade.<br /><br />Well, enjoy the Holidays and I would recommend this movie as it would make an excellent addition to anyone's library.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I effing love these books I can read them over and over they make me laugh and make me cry and give me lots of great ideas hmmmm.... but seriously they are very sex oriented but it is so much more than that the author really brings out the love and romance behind all the gory sex/sub scene and you get the entire book from a perspective that has no prior knowledge of the sub/dom society (neither did i) so you really get to explore this new world with a really funny subconscious, its awesome.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|I loved the whole series! Will for sure miss it! The end left me in tears. If you are looking for a book to help you move on from Hunger Games this is it! I actually liked it better because of how real and authentic the characters were!
B002MQYOFW|4.0|i was really hooked on this book by just reading the sample that the kindle affers and there really was no question wether or not i was going to buy them all it is one of those things that &#34;i must know&#34; kinda things and i read them all in 2 days loved them and glad i read them but i will never read them again. they are just not that kind of books they are kinda sad and very depressing at times but never the less it was a good read glad i read them. I still smaile when i think about them.
1439190275|5.0|Great book, easy to follow.  Love the menus in the book.  They give good suggestions, so there's no mystery on what to eat.
B007IXWKUK|5.0|I effing love these books I can read them over and over they make me laugh and make me cry and give me lots of great ideas hmmmm.... but seriously they are very sex oriented but it is so much more than that the author really brings out the love and romance behind all the gory sex/sub scene and you get the entire book from a perspective that has no prior knowledge of the sub/dom society (neither did i) so you really get to explore this new world with a really funny subconscious, its awesome.
B00G9U7NEQ|1.0|We didn't even get a full fifteen/twenty minutes into this when we quit watching it. If I could mark a quarter of a star or less, I would.  &#34;We&#34; consisted of three adults between 36-75. It's nothing like Monsters, Inc.  We love Monsters, Inc.  Nothing in it to the point we watched was remotely like the comedy, hi-jinks, plot and follow through of Monsters, Inc.  Though a couple of things were kinda cute and funny, seems each approach to being zany, zippy or funny went flat and back to boring very quickly. ZZZZZZZZZ.  Very disappointed and sorry we wasted the money.  We ate our popcorn and talked about how flat the bit we'd watched had been.  :(
B007IXWL2C|5.0|these books ended just the way i wanted them to (no spoiler) but i am really glad i read them and they really make me giggle adn its just enteresting no matter how many times you read it love them love them
B00G32VYDG|4.0|Great acting, very fast paced story.  We had seen True Grit w/Bridges and he had the same type role playing Rooster Cogburn.  He does a very good job with that voice and characterization.  Didn't really think I'd like the movie as much as I did.  Sometimes, movies are just over the top with special effects and supernatural stuff.  But, this was greatly comedic.  We laughed quite a bit. &#34;We&#34; consists between 36-75 years of age.  We loved the message tubes and containers.  I know it's fantasy and crazy.  I still have a tad bit of difficulty w/characterizing after-life and God in the way this characterizes it and Him; however, for a fantasy funny move - great.  I do think there were some curse words in it ... been a few days since I watched it and I've forgotten.  We will probably watch it again sometime. Some characters are rather gruesome.  One of the &#34;monsters&#34; wasn't as &#34;monstered up&#34; as the other ones, kind of odd about that.  If you watch it, you might see what I mean.  We wondered if they didn't simply out-do MIB's beginnings.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|I got the movie in blue ray blew me away the audio was awesome picture and acting was great music was to story line was tripy great movie must buy
B0035LMTZA|5.0|Very good action.  Great roles for the actors.  Well played.  Loved it.  Great chase scenes.  Norton always plays a good bad guy.  Loved seeing Sutherland, sorry he had a short role but well played.  A re-watch.
B00915G6WQ|4.0|did not compare to all previous seasons. season 6 was 1000000 times better than the final season. did not like ending. love me some dexter though!
B006IGZX0C|4.0|Read the book and loved it.  The movie did a great job of following the book, glad a few parts weren't in it.  Hate the cursing, especially God's name being used.  Drives me nuts when that happens. The story is just good.  Glad we watched it, even my husband enjoyed it.
B0063IH60K|4.0|Really enjoy this game keeps you on toes and thinking on how you can win. I would recommend this game to anyone looking improve themselves.
B008Y6SLL2|4.0|Very intense plot and detailed story.  Well played.  Was nicely surprised that it was a good movie.  It's been a few days since we watched it, but I think it had a bit of foul language, which I wish could be omitted.  We hadn't see &#34;Spock&#34; in anything else before - he did a good job.  It's a bit too real (based on true story) and quite scary ... greed was very well depicted.  Some heart and loss of heart.  Good show, just a tad long in a couple of places.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|So glad to have candy crush on my kindle!!! Love this game play on my phone.. Now have it on my kindle!! Love it!!
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Amazingly heartfelt and funny book. I'm not usually one for this kind of book, but I would recommend this one in a heartbeat. It reminded me of The Perks of Being a Wallflower and was just all around wonderful.
B007J4T2G8|5.0|Well I decided to give this book a try since everyone and their mom has read it and loved it. I read the story from a &#34;fantasy&#34; mindset-but I can see how realistically viewing this story people have become upset regarding abusive situations.<br /><br />To my complete surprise I actually loved the book...I felt all of the emotions on the roller coaster Anastasia was on during the book... and felt very ambivalent towards Christian-like she does. I enjoyed the easygoing language of the book and how Anastasia has an inner dialogue with her &#34;inner goddess&#34; and &#34;subconscious.&#34;<br /><br />That being said...I believe I am one of the rare readers who loved the book for the story- not the great sex or &#34;sexy&#34; Mr. Grey. There's no way in hell I'd ever want a Christian Grey or a relationship like that nor do I understand why he's so glamorized. But, Anastasia's story and wanting to be loved by someone who's messed up got me. I'm a 'fixer' too...
B00DJUPLY8|3.0|I use this player as an alternative to wmv players. What I don't care for is it's habit of duplicating the same video twice. This is not constant but does happen on occasion. the thumbnail views are helpful. There are times when the viewer shows it's icon and not a thumbnail view. The title is displayed avoiding confussion.
B00DR0PDNE|4.0|It was very easy to setup, and works beautifully.  I just wish that there were more apps available for IOS that would support it.
B006PZBR8S|5.0|best father and son movie EVER!  My son is 10, and I am 12 at heart.  We had a blast watching this for the second time.
B000002AGN|4.0|Great Brubeck from my early listening years. Takes me back and it still sounds great, so it is in my music collection. HIghly recommended!
B0013F1D02|5.0|This movie has it all~ true love, adventure, comedy & fantasy all rolled up into one! Great cast as well
B00F91RYL8|3.0|Brad Pitt is an excellent actor, but this movie didn't allow for much of that. Same old zombie plot with just a tiny bit of a twist.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Sycamore Road<br /><br />I have read all of John Grisham's books and Sycamore Row ranks up there among my favorites. My very favorite was The Client.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|Awesome inspirational story. This guy is truly fearless. Make me feel like a wuss even though I have completed Tough Mudder.
0307949486|2.0|I had been looking forward to reading this one: it's a best seller, was made into 2 movies (one swedish, one american), and - because it's a trilogy - the buzz is still going strong.<br /><br />while reading it, i admit i was carried along - good story telling (interrupted by some odd, almost catalogue-like descriptions of products in there) and yet, always, there was this sense of unease...<br /><br />the chapters open with stats about violence against women in sweden - it's a foreshadow of violence to come of course, but as the novel progressed, i started to doubt the author's intention in using these stats. what initially appears as an indictment against such violence, soon feels like an instruction manual. the author even has a character that catalogues which types of behavior he can inflicit on which types of women.<br /><br />finally, the pivotal rape scene (which i hear is quite graphic in both movies) is positioned in between a passage of 2 other characters having consentual sex... does this mean the author sees both sexual acts as equal? (no one can ask him these hard questions as he died shortly after he handed in his 3 novels)<br /><br />at the end of the book, there's a teaser for the 2nd novel. i only skimmed it, as by this time i was feeling rather disgusted in this man's success in feigning his feminism. basically, the opener is a captive and bound twelve year old being sexually assaulted repeatedly. so now the author has widened his scope of misogyny to children.
B00DY9X3JO|5.0|Finally! Dianne Reeves's first new album in over 5 years, and it's one of her best, on par with my all time favorite, 1999's &#34;Bridges&#34;.<br /><br />If you know Dianne Reeves, then you probably don't need me to tell you her voice only grows more magnificent as the years pass.  You probably don't need to read another person comparing her to Sarah Vaughan, or to point out how astonishing her ability to improvise is.  Really, the only question when a new album comes out is about what songs she'll include, and how good the arrangements will be.<br /><br />After hearing her go through a phase where she focused too heavily on overdone jazz standards with straightforward arrangements, here we have Dianne Reeves back in her purest, most perfect form: crossing musical genres with abandon, incorporating popular songs never attempted in a jazz vein before, soaring over original and creative arrangements, expressing deeply held personal philosophies and beliefs through her lyrics.<br /><br />It's wonderful to hear Dianne returning to more eclectic, personal material as she had done earlier in her career.  About half the songs are written or co-written by Dianne herself, with the rest coming from musicians as diverse as Bob Marley, Stevie Nicks and Ani DiFranco.  As with all of her best music, Dianne completely reinvents these songs with a jazz sensibility and a soulfulness that, for me, far outshines the original versions.  Just take a listen to what she does with Fleetwood Mac's &#34;Dreams&#34; for one example.<br /><br />The only criticism I have is that I could have done without &#34;Stormy Weather&#34;, the only jazz standard included.  It's also the longest track, taken at a dirge-like tempo, and while it's performed artfully, does the world really need yet another version of this song?  I prefer hearing Dianne do things that no one else can do.  Truth be told, as commercially unpopular as jazz is, the world overflows with singers who can capably carry a jazz ballad.<br /><br />As of this writing, the CD is only available as an expensive import.  I was going to wait for the U.S. release-- I really have to watch the pennies these days-- but knowing how big a fan I am, a friend ordered it for me as a gift and I couldn't be more grateful to have this rare opportunity to be the first in the U.S. to comment on it.  Fans should not even consider passing this one by when it's released here!.<br /><br />As of this writing, the CD is only available as an expensive import.

B00FAPF5U0|2.0|because I can't get this game on my android tablet<br /><br />I do play it on my desktop but can't get the full real game on my tablet which stinks
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|Fun movie! The whole family enjoyed watching it together. We will likely add it to our movie collection. The kids watched it twice on instant video and really want to see it again! :)
B005XQLBU4|4.0|Blah blah this is not a bad game... they could make it a bit easier to get repair points but oh well.  Apparently I need to have a few more words to make this review count
B004VMUS9G|5.0|This IS my alarm now. I haven't used anything else since I got this app. The timer is there when I'm in the kitchen or playing games, too.
B006ZAZ31U|5.0|excellent reading not the same old tail of BUDS and the tough training that our teams go through but the story of the man and his family that are what make our teams the best in the world
B000ICRKLM|5.0|Love the series. It's classic.  If you are a SciFi fan, even if you never go into the other Stargate series, I bet you'll love this - give it a try.
B005GFPZYK|4.0|A good book on the life of a Seal Sniper operator deployed in combat and used as should be to protect our other combat forces
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book is great, but it takes a while to read as Veronica has decided to write different chapters from different character's point of view.<br /><br />You'll really have to adjust your mindset almost after every chapter to ensure that you understand what is going on, because of this I feel that the pace and the energy of the book slows down a lot more, but it is still entertaining.
B008MG1E4A|5.0|A good accounting of the way our teams work to gather to accomplish the job put before them for the good of our way of life
B007VUA7VO|5.0|Great as app shows how long battery will last for various functions on the phone.<br /><br />Very good app to see charge on battery
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Love it I played this game on facebook and like this version so much better the other game was always freezing up and stopping
B00FEHXCIG|3.0|Entertaining, decent special effects, would recommend to those who like the prior Iron Man movies and comic book themed movies
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|It was not enjoyable and made no sense at all.  Tried it to see what all the buz was about.  A stupid waste of time.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Excellent book in true Grisham style.  It seems like a long time between books but, once again, worth the wait.
B00F880BWG|4.0|I would give it five stars because I love this show, but I was not happy with the glitches. When I was watching this episode, it must of jumped ten or so times making a lot of the dialogue skip. I sometimes couldn't understand what they were saying because two or three words would get jumbled up. The picture was good quality,  but I would probably go with regular definition next time.
B00A3NQNUU|5.0|My 6 year old daughter loves this.  Not too much different than a lot of the other city builders but for some reason she really likes this one in particular.
B006GECE9Y|1.0|Installed on my Kindle fire hd 8.9&#34; and it continuously locked up. In fact, it slowed down my whole Kindle. I had to uninstall the app and restart my Kindle to get things back to where I was.
B0015DWJ8W|5.0|Great book on running by a dedicated, casual runner...just like the rest of us!  As a runner who started running late in Life Murakami captures the essense and motivation that many of us feel as we continue running and making it an integral part of our life.  Fun.  Insightful.  A welcomed gift to any runner.
B007PVHMCG|5.0|MY only son love play maincraft on his tablet. When i found this lego set i thought he need to own it. It is little bit price but i understand is because is maincraft staff .
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Love this series... love the characters... missing them already... wishing the ending was a little different but would definitely recommend all 3 of these books.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|I enjoyed this book a lot. Do not want to give anything away. The story was quick with twist and turns. Still guessing as to the outcome till the very end.
B00005AQF7|5.0|I would like to say this is by far one of the best G Funk albums 2nd to the Chronic the track listing has always been the same on the back of the CD it still has all the intro tracks don't worry about the tracks not being listed some other albums you need in your collection is of course Dr Dre The Chronic Eazy E's Eazy Dus It Ice Cube's The Predator 2Pac's 2pacalips now as far as the East Coast get  Biggie's Ready To Die Wu Tang 36 Chambers ODB's 36 Chambers the Dirty Virgin Wu Tang For Ever Jay Z's Vol. 2, Hard Knock Life Nas it was written Redman's Whut Thee Album as well as Redman's  Dare Iz a Darkside all classics ofcoue there are others but to me these are top notch
B008BQ8YHQ|5.0|Excellent show.  Like that it's free with Prime, but Season 3 isn't, so I guess I'll either have to pay, or forget it.<br /><br />Especially like that it's advertising free, otherwise would not watch it.
B004JK61K0|3.0|Rating may be too high. Spent a few minutes trying to get the program to work on my Samsung tablet the day I ordered it and had zero luck. I was trying to get it to work with Mozilla Thunderbird. Haven't messed with it since. I'll give it another try and then delete if I can't get it to work. Write up says it's not for sites like Hotmail. At least the price was right.
B00ABLJ5NQ|5.0|The most beautifully written and captivating story. I could get lost in this world that Neil has created. Invokes the imagination and brings back memories of childhood imaginings. With just the right touch of anticipation and fear.<br />Most definitely worth a read and will be a book I will reread.
1590171993|5.0|A very moving experience.  I don't know why the author is not more well known.  This is really a masterpiece about the academic life.
B00BGZ8OLA|5.0|Great story told in retrospect by a man/boy lost at sea with a tiger in the boat - and how he manages to survive.<br /><br />I read the book first (which was very good)  and liked the movie just as much or more than the book.<br /><br />If you watch this on a high-resolution large TV at home, the visual effects are astonishing.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I have to be honest—I'm a huge fan of this trilogy; however, this book seems to have been rushed. It doesn't have the same quality of writing as the other books. The end feels random and there is not enough character development to support it. I'm sorry to say that I am a bit disappointed.
B009LDCZ7I|5.0|Got 1st season as gift and got hooked.  Don't have Showtime so had to buy 2nd season. Was not disappointed.
0345803485|1.0|I didn't just read this book, I read the WHOLE trilogy for the same reason I vote. I have no right to complain unless I've taken the time to put my ballot in.<br />I absolutely can't stand any book where the female lead is made out to be a complete idiot. Christian Grey is as controlling and manipulative as they come, while Ana stands by like, &#34;It's not weird that my boyfriend won't let me leave his apartment to get a pap smear or my hair cut, but that's just because he loves me.&#34; She's so young and naiive, I keep thinking he's going to dress her in a Little House on the Prarie outfit and move to Utah with her. Their relationship boarders on creepy, and the &#34;erotic&#34; parts aren't anything special.
0375842209|5.0|Can't wait to see the movie! The metaphors in Zusak's writing are like a painting you look at an see many layers and emotions.  Sad but well written.
B0051ANPZQ|5.0|I liked how August didn't get teased in the end and won the Beecher Prep award and is one of the smartest kids I know that was homeschooled until 5 grade
B00G32OMF8|2.0|The 1st two of the trilogy are excellent with the 1st being the best. this one seems to be a venting of the female character and I felt that this really didn't lead anywhere. Very disappointing.
B000A2RRF4|5.0|An awesome historical record of the late great King of POP! He is a performer like no other!<br />Definitely a great investment that you will watch again and again and never cease to be amazed by.
B000ICKPOQ|5.0|Because it is a Stargate adventure continued from SG1.  Never a dull moment.  Just a great adventure.  Have watched all the Stargate series many times.  Glad it is still available.
B00EY8BRGU|3.0|Great beginning, interesting plot, but the ending left a bit to be desired. Magic is fascinating but the &#34;eye&#34;, come on really?
B00846REIS|5.0|Great story!!! Love it! Can,t wait to read the 4th book. Taking to long for the 4th book to come out.
B0069UP2PI|4.0|Really scary!  This could really happen.  There were lots of interesting characters, not just one hero  I wash my hands more after watching this film.
B00F91RYL8|5.0|Good story line put together well well-rounded has lots of good actors enjoy it something I would watch again any time
B00AYLTMMM|4.0|It had a very &#34;real&#34; feeling to it, as if someone has forgotten to add violins every time something emotional happened.  It was clever and funny.
B00EPFEY44|4.0|I Love his music. This particular CD/DVD has had to grow on me a bit.  There are a few songs on it that I just did not care for. Overall I still like it.
B00B2FLDRQ|5.0|This book is written from  a very intriguing perspective of rare personality.  It has humor as well as mournful passages.  I simply loved it.
B000B8QEYC|5.0|It is an album by Enya, what else needs to be said. It is a very good album. It is the kind of album you should listen to when you have had a bad day. It's great.
B0089LOG02|5.0|One of the best books I have read in a long time. And, a fast read. Warning: Don't start this one unless you have time to finish it!
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|If you've been a John Grisham reader through the years, then you'll love the way he returns to the 80's, to capture the mystery of events that take place.
B009ZZDNT6|5.0|I wasn't sure about this when I got it, but it has never failed me. I love that the app doesn't have to be open for the alarm to  work.
B003G4W49C|5.0|This is a book I've wanted to read for a LONG time.  Now that the movie is coming out I decided to get to it.  I'm glad I read it and can't wait to see the movie!
B00G32VYDG|2.0|Terrible script. Terrible plot. An MIB knockoff with terrible dialogue! Wait for it to be shown on cable. Don't waste your money.
B00G4I0DNG|5.0|\\"Blackfish\\" highlights the problematic elements of keeping killer whales in captivity and exploiting the animals for entertainment purposes.  Though decried by some as a willfully distorted vendetta against Sea World, it seems to me the film is fair in challenging Sea World's treatment of animal rights issues  precisely BECAUSE Sea World has traditionally had a sterling reputation in the mainstream. \\"Blackfish\\" is asking society to question and re-evaluate our assumptions about the \\"righteous\\" public image Sea World spends millions and millions of dollars each year trying to cultivate. This film challenges Sea Worlds public image by changing the frame of things--past events and current practices/philosophies--so that we may see a set of facts and events through the lens of a different interpretation of those facts and events. Far from being propaganda, this documentary is cutting edge investigative journalism at its finest.  Some criticize the film as \\"sensationalized\\" due to its graphic depiction of some of the incidents discussed.  But far from using the death of a trainer to sensationalize the issues in graphic detail, I consider this instead a bold work willing to go beyond all the Mickey Mouse bullcrap to start an honest conversation even though the conversation involves very unpleasant elements most people would rather not think about. Best documentary I have seen in a long time
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Very functional for watching You Tube an Netflix and easy to use.  However, the inability to cast other web pages and not being able to show my mobile pictures and videos on the TV screen make this product a bummer.  Apple TV would have been a better alternative.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Perfect ending to a fabulous series! She has an incredible way of writing which makes you feel as if you are right there with the characters. I highly recommend this series to anyone looking for a fun read. Beware... you won't be able to put it down!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|I am not a fan of games, however this one sucked me in from day one!! Be prepared to get sucked in!!
B008Y7N7JW|4.0|Wanted more at the end seem that is not all the story and does not explain a lot of thing.
B0031RAOVY|5.0|Such a good family movie! Although it is based on a true story, it has been changed quite a bit for the movie.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Cool app. I use it for school and it's an awesome app on my computer desk top. I suggest it.
B0089LOG02|5.0|I loved it!<br />I wanted it to continue. It was a little slow in the beginning, but combining the two characters was a great way to share the story.
0345535421|5.0|Perfect. Being a seller on amazon, I know how hard it is to get positive feedback even when one is doing everything right so I wanted to make sure this seller got a good rating. Everything went smoothly. I probably have shipped hundreds of items but rarely hear back from pleased customers...just angry ones which are almost always angry with no merit. So, great job seller, looking out for you!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|I had only ever seen the film adaption of The Shining and after reading this novel I had to read it! Danny and Abra are the perfect duo!

B0010T3UV6|5.0|I love love love these shoes soooooooo comfortable !!! They fit perfect I was scared they'd be too big but im a 7-7.5 I got the 7 and fits perfect with or without thick socks
B008XG1X18|5.0|Didn't think I'd use this much, but find that having a virtual bulletin board at my fingertips is VERY handy.
B00CNQ7HAU|4.0|Loved the book, a little predictable at times but worth reading. I didn't want the story to end. Now I ready for the next Grisham book.
B004X6PRO6|2.0|I found this book to be very involving for its first half but the abrupt change in the middle left me wondering where it was headed (and not in a good way).
B0073Q0DZG|5.0|What a wonderful movie!  If you like Jack Black, or Steve Martin, or Owen Wilson, or birds, or 'underdog triumphs' stories, or 'what's important in life' flicks, or just a really entertaining show, watch this movie!
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|Twenty or more words are required. This book is great, it's a King novel--of course it is!!!! I loved it, read it in three days.
B008IJT0CE|5.0|Loveli little app to help one fall asleep at night or have some wonder ambience to cloak the silence in a room
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Candy Crush is a great game BUT there have been glitches that haven't been resolved. A few examples are, loss of accumulated lives overnight, game freezes rendering the current game null and void, and necessary bug fix due to Facebook window &#34;flickering&#34;.
B00G253X56|3.0|I bought the subscription pass because I thought I'd be getting ALL the Doctor Who 50th Anniversary shows. I'm sad that so far there are only 4 shows to watch. (iTunes currently lists 6)<br /><br />Where are the episodes of DoctorRevisited for Doctors 1 - 7?<br />Where is the Mini-episode that the BBC put out 11/13/13?<br />Where are the Doctor Who Confidential Episodes?<br /><br />I love The Doctor in all his forms, but for this being called the &#34;Doctor Who: The 50th Anniversary Collection&#34; it sure isn't a very impressive one.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|Is been too long since i watch this movie, this one in particular was my introduction into Anime back on the days as for  the movie it self on blueray doesn't change the original VHS much you get the grain or &#34;Noise&#34; thing from back on the days and i think that makes this move more special since it doesn't change the original that much
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Grisham has never written a &#34;bad&#34; book.  Each one is unique and holds my interest until the last paragraph.<br />Sycamore Row is all about family, greed and in the end, love.
B005544TRQ|5.0|My wife and I really enjoy this...now on season 2. This will get us through the winter..Prime is a great deal.
B00FY9JJYA|5.0|This album has GRAMMY in big bold letters written across the top! Unbelievable! Music still lives in r and b, hip hop, and jazz!
B007J4T2G8|5.0|I'm not a big time reader but heard many reviews about the book. I love the series and can't wait to read more by this author
B00BMGUIJE|5.0|super fast shipping. got a week early. awesome figure.great for collectors who love one piece. great paint job.simply awesome. i will buy more in future
B00127RAJY|1.0|Didn't work. When I tried to play the DVD in my computer and DVD player it did not work because it was too scratched
B00B2JSRAS|5.0|Love it, love it, love E-Squared!<br />The book is wonderfully written with great truths that the world needs to know!
0634086782|5.0|I recomend it to ALL Jazz lovers, This book contains everything you need to start learning this amazing style and is writen in a way that you will definitely understand the theorys!
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|Fun game. On the kindle the controls can be a bit awkward to manage. It is funny to see Abe Lincoln using a death ray to kill zombies
B00AGJ4HC2|5.0|Words cannot express how much I &#34;love&#34; this simple but very fun card game. How they crammed so much game into just 16 cards is amazing! Completely recommend to anyone who enjoys short card games.
B00CQRN3QI|5.0|Was a gift for my lil pirate nephew,he loved it!!  I watched it with him-4 Times in one weekend but so great to share some Disney Magic with him:)
B008AT71WI|5.0|Feed Me! - more. This is a classic come back to life. First musical I have really enjoyed (sorry dear, Sound of Music - Not for me). The cast was perfect, and if you like Steve Martin's humor you will really enjoy his performance.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|There can be a kink here or there but the makers are constantly working on correctional they upgrade. Recommend this game for Tetris lovers. Our entire family of 5 play. Available on all devices we have finally!
B004EPYZQ2|5.0|Great, Great, Great Movie! Every generation will enjoy this movie - particularly the &#34;Boomers&#34;. Great story line and pitch perfect humor. You gotta see it!
B00499NHLC|5.0|great show very intruging plot lines. It engages you without forcing the show down your throat. The actors are awesome, cant wait for season 3!
B000SO7OL6|5.0|I love Diana Krall's gentle touch on the piano.  She touches each and every piece with a warmth and intimacy that leaves this listener asking for more.  AND, she brings some superb musicians with her.  She makes jazz sound great and feel cozy.
B003U4UPHG|5.0|Lost was such a fantastic series.  I loved the whole thing, and Season 2 is when it really started getting good.
B004DLPXAO|5.0|Sorry - I don't have kindle for android, I have it for ipad and iphone. Only one complaint - If I use x-ray and go to another place in the book, I have to remember where I was rather than the program taking be back automatically. Otherwise, I love the reading on both my phone and ipad (switching back and forth depending on which is available), the search feature and the x-ray feature is absolutely great, and It is fun to get the book you want when you want it wherever you are.
B00CF34B2I|5.0|This is fun. More than I thought it would be I don't want to buy the app because it already takes up so much of my time.
B00FRCNNVY|5.0|A good combination of south Asian and American Jazz.  Norah is listed on two songs.  The album as a whole is well worth the effort of listening to.
B00F8MIIKO|5.0|Cute movie! My 5 & 2 year old sat still for nearly the entire movie which doesn't happen all that often.
B005BRS8Z6|1.0|It's poorly written, boring, self-help/analysis bunk. Hmmm, I need fourteen more words but I don't believe it is worth that much effort.
B00EY8BRGU|4.0|I enjoy suspenseful movie and this one had me guessing. I didn't enjoy the romantic storyline, it seemed forced and a bit weird. If it weren't for this I would have probably given it a 5.
B005H9B44A|4.0|This move is action- filled with likable characters. A fun movie that I enjoyed very much. The sound was great!
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Just what I needed. Very good. Simple and effective. Easy to access. Good addition to my tablet arsenal of apps.
B000VE439Y|5.0|Bought this for my husband  it  is every bit as funny as we remember it to be. We both love Monty Python and needed to get this on disc t replace vhs
B00BTYP6QE|5.0|Super Fun!  Challenging and cute, lots of levels to unlock.  Great way to pass the time in the waiting room!
B0053KWDES|1.0|It does increase the volume - no problem.  But it does so at the sacrifice of increased distortion.  Unacceptable.  Very disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I haven't finished the book. I was bored by it early on, and tried to get through it, but just didn't find it as interesting and engaging as the first two books. I have since looked at the reviews and &#34;spoilers&#34; posted by other people, just as a gauge in deciding whether or not to muddle through it. But on the basis of what I have read, the ending is disappointing and the reviews judge the book as down right rotten. So, to sum up, it is  not even close to the quality of the first two, it's not an exciting story, the characters are plodding, and per the review of others, the ending is REALLY upsetting. I don't like what I have read so far, and I won't be reading the rest of it. It's too bad I've already paid for it. It would be nice if the people behind the book had not been rewarded for such a poor effort.
B00ADW4I9O|5.0|Beautiful! Perfection! Sheer GENIUS!!!!! Buy it Now, you'll regret it if you don't. It is worth every penny and you'll enjoy it like never before.
B00ESNDQWY|5.0|This is the best episode of the season, so far!  The tension and excitement was almost unbearable! I was on pins and needles. Wonderful performances by all.
B00ED1QYSE|5.0|Finally back in print! The remastering job is fantastic, with every nuance finally audible at normal volume - with or without headphones - and an undeniably amazing track list of great songs from Stiv Bators (Dead Boys), Brian James (The Damned), Dave Tregunna, and Nicky Turner. It's a shame that there are no bonus tracks, as there are dozens (if not hundreds) of studio rarities and even more live recordings of the band in its prime archived... but here's hoping that a comprehensive collection of singles, B-sides, demos, and ace live tracks is in the works, eh?! This is an essential debut, and highly recommended to fans of the members' previous bands as well as to fans of Goth-tinged post-punk ala New Model Army, Flesh For Lulu, Balaam And The Angel, The Birthday Party, et al.
B003H4I4JU|5.0|Great book. Hard to follow prelude.  Ending leaves you waiting wanting. The majority of the story is brilliant.  An interesting mind created these stories.
B00EP22QKG|4.0|The outfit works a little bit on her but she needs to change those glasses.<br />But it isn't about her wardrobe it's about her music, right.
B0089LOG02|4.0|Interesting story but a bit predictible.  Wish there was a bit more background and build up about the orphan trains.
B009ZQ8FQG|5.0|this continues to be great show with good casting, story line and interesting time period.  great for all ages.  try it
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Excellent writing.  The author knows how teenagers think.  It is a very moving story.  Be sure to bring your tissues.
B001RCD2DW|5.0|I'm a professional musician & arranger.  When i listen to music I notice not only the musical content but also all the production aspects of the recording.  The AKG K702 headphones are very accurate and fill these needs very well!  They are comfortable to wear and sound great.<br />I would recommend these headphones to anyone who needs to listen to all the fine details of a recording.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|Very great album! I love every song! the songs are  new edgy experimental and good! Gaga has done it again! :D
B00CWY76CC|4.0|It's a very challenging game. One must be prepared to spend a lot of time playing this game. Very fun.
B004222UC8|5.0|LOVE IT! I have owned this album since it came out. I still own the original vinyl. The remastered version sounds pristine and the extras are interesting also but I still prefer the original album.
B00CNQ7HAU|3.0|Great Grisham writing as usual, but bogged down with family trees.<br />Did not enjoy as much as &#34;Time to Kill&#34;
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Horrible ending. Annoying story line. So disappointed having waited so long for this book. It ruined the love I had for this series.
B006O6EOII|1.0|These dolls are total garbage. Made with very cheap material and break extremely easily. Don't waste your money on them!!
B00DR0PDNE|5.0|It works flawlessly. I use it every day and have found it very useful in the car too. Who needs a DVD player when you can use the phone as a video source.
B0060D15AK|5.0|This is a go to guilty pleasure movie for me.  It is predictable, but cute and funny.  I have seen it several times and it always makes me smile.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I was so touched at the closeness between the family and staff. This was not an ordinary employer/ employee relationship, but more a very close familial one in which the objective was protection of each other.
B00EKQ3YZI|4.0|Excellent, except for &#34;On the Radio&#34; and &#34;Working the Midnight Shift&#34;. What were they thinking? She is, and always will be my favorite singer of all time and I really enjoyed the new mixes, except for the 2 travesties.
B006Z9K97E|5.0|I have read books on the Holucast, Japanese prisoner camps, the rape of Nanking and so on. But I was not prepared for this book and 40 pages in I could read no more. I did pick it up again, feeling that I cannot just close the cover and look away - like the world has more or less done. I did finish the book and as the is light at the end of the tunnel, at least for Shin, it is mildly easier to read.<br /><br />The  book is a five because of the extraordinary story. It was an easy read, written in a factual story telling style.
B00CL8D83U|4.0|The case was broken. The CD is just what I expected. I never get tires of &#34;The Boys&#34;. Highly recommend.
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|I enjoyed the story and the recurring characters but, feel it'll translate much better into a movie. Reading journal entries and calorie counts doesn't flow the plot along as easily as prose does for the reader. If you liked the other books, you will get a great opportunity to read about Bridget's next phase of life.
B00EW9GQR6|3.0|Too much Hip-Hop...I think she has sold out. Some very strong tracks but nothing to equal the previous 2 offerings.
B008HK3XKO|5.0|My 9-year old grandson called me right after he received it and raved over all the features.  The stand, cover strap and on-off capabilities of the cover are great features.  I have one as well and these features are why I bought it for my grandson.
B00ARF93AQ|2.0|It was certainly more entertaining than the Stallone version, but they probably could've  spent a lot less money for the exact same quality.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|My kids recommended this book to me. My son, a 20 year old cynic, told me it was his favorite book of all time. I read it during a long day of travel, and found myself constantly weeping and laughing at the same time.
B009WUBERW|2.0|It is a guilty pleasure watching the 'old'  action stars going at it,  otherwise, the entire movie is a farce.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|I thougtht it was rather tedious, slow. The end without a point of emotion.It was disappointing this book to me.
0062014536|2.0|This is the first time I have felt compelled to write a review for any book, as I was shockingly disappointed with how the final book in the otherwise good trilogy played out.  While Lena was strong in the prior stories, she was a &#34;wimp&#34; in this one.  We also had the backstories of Hana, Isabel and Raven from the separate short stories the Oliver wrote and a major plot in Raven's story was ignored in the final book!  She discovered her pregnancy toward the end of book two and it is never mentioned in the entirety of book three.  What is that about?  No one noticed as the months passed?  My other huge problem with this ending is that there isn't one.  We have no idea what happens to any of the characters or how the fight for love concluded.  The story abruptly ends mid-battle.  This would have been an acceptable ending only if a fourth book was planned, but not in a trilogy.  It seems as if Oliver just had no idea where to go or whom/what Lena should choose.  If I were writing a planned trilogy, I would definitely have a planned and known resolution.  Overall, I am not sure I would read any future Oliver books and would not recommend beginning this book, or the trilogy for that matter.
B003P2WO5E|2.0|I thought this book was going to be like The Game of Thrones series of books by George R R Martin, which I absolutely adored. The Game of thrones books had some elements of fantasy, such as giants, the geography and deadly wraiths, but the world building was not as well, surreal as it is in this book. It main strength was the stellar writing, plotting and characterization. In terms of setting it actually had a lot in common with Medieval Europe.<br /><br />The fantastical elements in The Way of Kings can be distracting. Instead of birds there are &#34; sky eels&#34;. Why do that? I found it more irritating than interesting. It may be that I am not a fan of High Fantasy- but I did enjoy The Lord  of the Rings trilogy which I have read at least twice.
B00B0LPWU6|2.0|For language and coarseness!<br />Thought it would be exciting action film but couldn't watch because so vulgar. Skip this one
B00BEK6Z7M|5.0|Once again I could not put the title down until I finished it. Preston and Child lured me into their writing long ago with Relic and since then I have eagerly waited for each new title. White Fire, the latest in the Pendergast books had me from the start. I enjoy the inclusion of Corrie Swanson as well - engaging from the first page sincerely could not stop reading until the last page. There are always surprises, once is continually drawn in to the characters. Looking forward to the possibility that Captain will continue to make appearances in future titles as well. Another benefit to these authors is that my vocabulary improves with each book as they use language not commonly used but that which can improve my academic writing on occasion. Hats off to Preston and Child for another wonderful book and I am eagerly awaiting the next - be that Gideon or Pendergast and company.
B00499NHLC|4.0|There may be too much of the darkness in this version of Sherlock Holmes for me. He is almost a super hero with his keen observations, but he seems to be unable to control himself. I found it too depressing.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This is new science concerning sugar on our entire body , including our brain. It makes a good case on cutting down on the consumption of sugar and grains. It was a bit too demanding for me.  However, I have lost weight and have more energy by just following most of his recommendations. It is not just a temporary diet, it is a way to eat for the rest of your life. I am enjoying a whole new way to eat.  I'm not sure it is for everyone.  Most would not even try to give up so much.  To me the results are worth it!
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|Some of the levels take hours to beat. While I thoroughly enjoy a challenge, when it takes a week or more to beat one level it takes the fun out of the game. And it would be nice if we were allowed to send our friends the special help items instead of having to pay cash to get even one after using them all.
B00BD99JMW|5.0|After finishing this book I thought about it for days. For me, that is the sign of a great story.  I was angry at the ending, but it was because I wanted it to end the way I wanted it to end; where the characters live &#34;happily ever after,&#34; albeit in a dystopian world.<br /><br />This story should require thoughtful analysis from its readers. I had to dig deep into my own feelings about what movitated the characters and the complex themes about genetic manipulation/euginics. (I admit there were weaknesses in plot development and in some of the characters.)<br /><br />Readers want to be satisfied with the ending of a 3 book series--as one might feel after eating a wonderful meal--and this book can do that, if you give it time to sink in and digest. I am still mad at Tris and heartbroken for Tobias, and l want to say the heck with selflessness/Abnegation.  But, Tris was true to BOTH of her factions.  She was both Dauntless and Abnegation in her ultimate decision. Therefore, I understand the ending and got a great dessert, so to speak, just not the one I ordered!<br /><br />(I recommend listening to the books on the audible version.  The narrators voices are gorgeous and you will have a clear point of view from the characters in the last book.)
B00GHJ1S2M|1.0|Love GaGa. Hate this album! Should have known it would be a flop after 'applause' was released. I am highly disappointed.
B00BMKH5NW|5.0|This book was amazing. There was not a single character I didn't love. I loved the story. I really can't even say anything other than love when it comes to this book. I loved Cather. She was quirky, neurotic, funny, creative, amazing. In so many ways I identified with her. And Levi was one of the best book boys I've ever read. I wished it would never end. I wish there was more. That's my only complaint about this book. It ended too soon.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|This movie is excellent! Denzel Washington is always the best-one of my favorites-but he really did an excellent<br />job playing an alcoholic; and the movie itself was an edge of the seat show-loved it-will watch it again-might buy<br />it!!
B00BD99JMW|4.0|I would choose five if it were'nt for the ending.  It was just too sad, and was very disappointing too.
B00FXEL00W|5.0|This book was nice show that gay couples are just every day people I liked Peyton she was a amazing caterer and Kendall too show that life is hard but be true too your self keep up the good work and look forward too reading more from this author
B000T0XEGS|5.0|The overture alone is worth the price of the movie. Saw it when it came out and, yes, it is not exactly as Verdi wrote it. But the voices and the acting are above excellent.
B00D7Z4GQY|2.0|The first chapter was good and I was eager to read more, but then the next chapter introduces new characters, and I didn't like this. So I read chapter 2 and it was okay but I was eager to pick up again with Cecilia. Then I come to Chapter 3 and I'm introduced to MORE NEW characters and I am pissed. So I say screw it and skip to chapter 4, and FINALLY! we're back to Cecilia! But it's a short chapter and then when it's over I'm back to the other less interesting characters and I'm not at all sure how they are relevant. The beginning sentence to Chapter 5 hooks me in, though, and I'm wondering what's going on, so I read. It's like starting a movie 20 minutes in, I guess, and you're not sure who these people are or what's going on, but you want to find out, so I keep reading.<br /><br />That's pretty much how I read the first half of this novel. I thought about quitting the book altogether whenever I came to these irrelevant characters, but I figured, just quit them, and get on to the good stuff. The Main Event. Cecilia and her husband.<br /><br />Around chapter 24, the other characters start becoming both more interesting and more relevant so I was forced to read their chapters, and in some chapters, Cecilla was featured right there with them and this made for better reading.<br /><br />The rest of the book I read all the chapters, using my speed-reading skills for the boring sections, and skipping a few pages here and there but I was doing less and less of that as the book came to a close.<br /><br />Overall, an okay-good read. I do like how everything came together at the climax. I'm torn between 2 and 3 stars for this, so I'll settle for 2 and a half because I usually don't have to skip so much material in 3 star reads. Even with all the skipping I did, I can't say I feel as though I missed much at all. Even with all the skipping it still took 5 days to read.<br /><br />I'm not sure why there is so much hype to this book.
B001DJ7PNW|5.0|The Director's Cut is definitely the way to go. Oliver Stone and Kevin Costner at their best. A great portrait of New Orleans too.
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Loved this book and loved the characters. Hated the ending.  It was  true to the characters but it was not how I thought things should go. Guess that's why I am not the author. If the movies make it this far I am not sure I will go see this one.
B0091REZMW|4.0|Fun game. Energy runs out pretty quick, but it also recharges fast, so it evens out.  The game has plenty of challenges to keep it interesting. No problems so far with gameplay. It's a good game for those of us who enjoy hidden picture games.
B00ESNE696|5.0|because it is a great show and there are not very many good shows on TV.  Hoping it will contiune for a long time.
B009ZQC7MY|4.0|The season was highly engaging and the acting was fabulous. All the characters were well developed and began to feel like family and friends. However I hated that they killed off Matthew!
B007WEQ3K8|5.0|Excellent brain training.  The game are interesting and addictive.  They have helped improve my mind.  I highly recommend this app for all.
B008PSPNFG|5.0|Enjoying every nuance of Mr. Vai musical idiosyncrasies! Loving the production and the vast musicality of this great musical piece of art!
B00G32OER4|3.0|Some parts of the movie was super scary.... Towards the middle of the movie things start to happen  and it looses scary points. Teens and people  easily scared will get a kick out of this one.
B00DW3X07M|5.0|Excellent work from Mr. Donati and the rest of the bandmates. On the same vein of Planet X Quantum album. Loving every second of this masterpiece of Prog/Fusion!
B00DAPOHU6|3.0|Good but not as good as the first 3 cd's. I am a huge fan just not as good as some of his previous work.
B004G600A4|5.0|THIS IS A FANTASTIC MOVIE.  WISH I COULD FIND A LENOX OR BRADFORD EXCHANGE 6-8 INCH FIGURINE FOR MY COLLECTION OF MAXIMUS; THAT HORSE HAS SUCH A FUNNY DISPOSITION AND IS VERY ENTERTAINING.
B004W1GCNC|4.0|Great show! Too few episodes!  Cannot wait to dive into Season 2.  Definitely a good distraction while waiting for new Downton.
B008JFUO36|5.0|ONCE YOU UNDERSTAND WHAT IT IS OCCURING, YOU GET IT.  TAKES SOME THOUGHT, THOUGH.  IT IS ENERTAINING…..TOM CRUISE, DIDN'T DISAPPOINT ME.
B007SGM084|5.0|I absolutely LOVE these books the writer keeps to going from one chapter to the other so you just don't want to stop.  Unfortunately you have to stop every now and then when the family wants something to eat or you want to sleep. I LOVE Christian Grey!
B004HO6I4M|4.0|THIS MOVIE WAS RATHER A DISAPPOINTMENT.  I EXPECTED MORE FUN AND ENTERTAINMENT FROM IT. GRANDKIDS WERE BORED WITH THE FILM.
B007EECSFA|5.0|Wonderful author who writes in great detail and creates unexpected twists. Page turner. Ending is a huge twist that no one in my book club guessed. Bravo Kate Morton!
B00993FEUK|4.0|DISAPPOINTED IN THE MOVIE CONTENT; NOT AS HUMOROUS AS I EXPECTED.  PAID QUITE A BIT, SO WOULD NOT ORDER, BUT RENT FIRST.
B006GHA9QQ|1.0|One of the worst things I have ever seen.  Totally rewrites what happened in the Phantom of the Opera.  Music was bad, story was bad.  It was BAD!
B00BN3DPQ4|5.0|GLAD TO SEE ARNOLD BACK IN MOVIES.  THOUGH I AM DISAPPOINTED IN HIS PERSONAL LIFE, HE IS A GOOD ACTOR.  COLORS ON FILM ARE BETTER QUALITY THAN ON THE REGULAR DVD.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I loved the book and its complex flawed characters. In fact I could not put it down, often reading late in the night when I should have been sleeping. This book is a must read....fascinating!!
B008JFUR10|5.0|THIS IS A GRAND MOVIE; THOUGH LONG, IT HAS TONS OF ACTION WITH ROBOTIC CHARACTERS; MUCH MORE SUITABLE FOR THE YOUNG THAN TRANSFORMERS.
6301976258|5.0|This movie was used as part of a history class. It is both family friendly and educational about choices we all must make!
B00947N6UG|5.0|MY DAUGHTER LOVED THIS MOVIE, HOWEVER I WAS BORED.  THE PLOT JUST DIDN'T CARRY THROUGH FOR ME, BUT I GIVE IT 5 STARS AS SHE LOVED IT.
B00CNQ7HAU|2.0|There is an error in the download and I have not been able to open it.  Have tried to reload, but no success.  I am currently traveling and not a lot of phone access, though other books I've ordered have downloaded without problem.
B00EDUTGB2|3.0|this is not as robust as other PC to printer applications. for example you can not print your e-mail messages. But! then again its free!! You will also need the other application (HP ePrint) to make it owrk with the HDX Fire!!
B0066W1AZK|4.0|Good Chess game with basic, easy to read graphics.  Simplicity at it's best!  Great game to practice ones Chess skills.
B00AECGQF2|5.0|My girls love this game, which offers several different base characters and gives options for cutting, coloring and highlighting spray tools, blow drying and combing in a variety of shapes, curling, straightening, and quick regrowth brush for hair.
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|Compact design. Fast transfer speeds. Adequate room between ports to allow attachment of bulkier USB devices like card readers.<br />Good price.
1250038820|5.0|I enjoyed it a lot! Spent 6 months in NY under sad circumstances. But this was a way I could really see NY. Thanks!
B00FEMJF6O|5.0|Fun fast moving game. So far hasn't required any real $$ so that's good! Enough like the Facebook game to keep it interesting.
B00G32OER4|3.0|Not quite as scary as I anticipated.  With all the hype I expected it to be scary.  It was ok but not a movie I would pay to watch again.
0812550706|4.0|Read this book several years go.  Gripping, well written, imaginative.  I loved it.  I am not a real sci-fi guy, but this book crosses over as a great suspense/action book!
B00AAI7B7W|4.0|This movie still scares the crap out of me. One of the best horror movies of all time! I saw this as a kid and swore the devil was going to come after me. Watched as an adult and still scary. We need more true horror movies like this one. A must see for horror movie lovers.
B009LDD54K|5.0|The shipping was excellent it came extremely fast and I love it when that happens. The packaging was great it was sealed and brand new. I cant wait to enjoy a few drinks and watch this season. I am one extremely satisfied customer
B003FAJTOA|3.0|An interesting Japanese movie worth watching if you like Japanese movies.  Interesting relationships that sadly are often true to life
B00F6JKT7O|5.0|If you're a fan of &#34;Heartwork&#34;-era Carcass this album will be quite satisfying for you.  It's heavy, the musicianship is as great as ever, and they seem to have lost none of their edge with age.
B0001XAOLQ|4.0|enjoyed this movie well worth the watching. shows the real drama of serving on these u-boats and ordeals they endured
B008XG1X18|5.0|I love to keep the ideas so I can find them when I need them. Wish I could find out how to pin with an app on my home page of the computer.
B00004ZBVG|5.0|Gene Hackman protrays this role to perfection. This is a great movie, as with all stories of real events, they always outdo the fictional ones.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|I would have given it 6 except there is no way to win on some of the games without purchasing moves
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Great writing. You are either going to love how it ends or hate it. Very exciting quick read. Wish I hadn't read it so fast because now it's over! Can't wait for the film version next year.
B006M7JCC2|5.0|I really enjoyed this book. I was so interested in Anita's story after seeing her on Dr. Wayne Dyers PBS special. It was eye opening to hear about her near death experience.
B00122N23M|5.0|I have all of the songs in this album, but love these versions of them.  Mark Knopfler rocks my world.
B00ESB75FA|5.0|If you like the first 8 seasons this one will not disappoint you.  Only Ted could extend a week of in show time into a full season.
B00D7Z4GQY|5.0|Wonderful story of everyday people and the secrets they hide and how a simple act can become life changing all quickly.
B00C6B9H46|4.0|An excellent popcorn flick all around, however, the first ten minutes will grab you by the eyeballs and never let go!
B008FRFN7A|5.0|This ap is awesome! I can actually print from my kindle HD fire. This is the best print app I've ever used because it works.
B0018O4YSQ|5.0|A stylish sci-fi film that presents some utterly stunning and unforgettable imagery. A decent script, but at times it feels that it's held together only by the force of the actors who bring it to believable, forceful life.
B0040I09RM|5.0|I love this ! Now I can watch what everybody is talking about !!!  Great sound & picture... Love my Kindle Fire HD...
B006LSZECO|5.0|One of the best books that I have ever read.  Her ability to pace a story and color environments is wonderful.  Please continue wring novels.
B005FMZWD8|5.0|I've lost count of how many compliments I've gotten on this watch. It's got an extremely attractive, bright, shiny body and face, with a comfortable band. So far, it keeps impeccably perfect time, and takes the minor abuse of wearing it to work without showing any notable scuffs.
B000JMKTLO|5.0|Flynn has a gift for color and eminence that is thoroughly engaging.  I normally read three novels simultaneously, but her works I have to read cover to cover.  Wonderful literature.
B00ARF93AQ|3.0|Lots of action, lots of special effects.  Story was and dialog was a bit cheesy.  I like story rich and suspenseful movies.
B0027MJU00|5.0|Gillian Flynn has a unique ability to write from within her characters so the reader experiences their pathos. Most enjoyable
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This book just wasn't as good as the other two. That being said, there other two were outstanding,and although this one isn't as good,it's still worth the read.
B005H9B44A|2.0|Best described as absurd fantasy, completely disregarding characters' well established description and persona as well as abilities per Nordic mythology. Writers needed more guidance. Movie filmed in  dark colors mostly grey and blues, complete disappointment.
B00ADQCBEY|3.0|good action and he tells it like it is. the stories are quick and quite interesting, easy to follow and keep your attention.
B00FAX6XQC|5.0|This is one heck of a game. Really cool. Best hunting game I've played in a really really long time.
B0042TV4IW|5.0|This is a great series. I feel I am in the stories myself. Lark Rise has become a part of me and so has Candleford. I am intrigued by what comes next with every episode I watch. Mr. Thomas Brown is one of my favorite characters as he comes into the post office daily and has some remark or wondering about his believes. I am in love with everyone of the characters on this series. The sisters are just too funny and deep down you can see their caring nature as they gossip about everyone in town, hahaha! this is a delight to watch.
B0083P1QUM|5.0|As usual an awesome book. I was kept in suspense the entire book. Can't wait to read Dust and Red Mist.
B0083Z6AH6|5.0|The beginning of this Jan Austen book has so much old English that it is hard to understand but it became easier to get the meaning after a couple of chapters.  It's another love conquers all obstacles with a little mystery.  I enjoyed this very much.
B00CW6DAKC|3.0|It takes way too long for updates then there's a short time limit to complete activities. I'm still waiting for new thanksgiving update. Some have it some don't a nd it's too hard to get neighbors. And why can't we communicate with each other as neighbors should......I'm over it, ready to uninstall.
B001DUDKEY|5.0|i liked it better than the 70's version because it explained more of the book. Frederick was waaay cuter in in the 70's version though.
B005V2S7FW|5.0|I have been using LastPass for years, and think it is the best password manager out there. I use it on PCs, phones, and tablets. LastPass makes it easy to use a different, strong password on every site, so even when (not if) one of your sites gets compromised, you don't have to change passwords everywhere else.

B000I186FW|5.0|I really enjoyed this well crafted film. 'V' is thought provoking and impressive as it delivers on multiple levels.<br /><br />Set in near future London, 'V' creates a compelling story as it extrapolates current events within the dark, brooding themes borrowed from the original \\"Phantom of the Opera\\". However, 'V' is far from a reprise of the original 'Phantom': although remaining true to 'Phantom's' original tragic love story, 'V' re-purposes the personal to convey its broader, social/political statement.<br /><br />If you're not put off by fairly graphic violence, I believe you'll enjoy 'V' as every facet of this film was well thought out and crafted to strengthen its theme. No clinkers here in the acting department. Natalie Portman, faced with a demanding role, renders a compelling 'Evey' and Hugo Weaving's mysterious 'V' was truly mesmerizing. Excellent support provided by Stephan Rea, John Hurt, and Stephan Fry: they also deserve considerable credit for delivering intriguing, believable characters.<br /><br />'V' succeeds by entertaining and prompting us to examine the conflicts and dilemmas when trying to balance freedom and security.
B001F9Y2CM|4.0|If you are like me and tend to like the ABBA songs that weren't the big hits, this is a great set to purchase. The only thing I would have liked to see more of is their work in other languages, but at this price, I can't complain. I'm happy with the purchase.
1451613520|5.0|Actually it was difficult to accept that we were water boarding back in 1901.  Had to loan it to a friend who is a history buff.  It will take time for me to accept Americans as such violent and cruel nation.  Certainly makes it easier to understand why there is so much violence in the country.
B00AEBBA72|5.0|Excellent movie, well done; it captures all of the mystique of Sleepy Hollow is and adult manner and stays close to the original story. w
B003E8P9G0|5.0|It was good because blah blah blah<br />Pokemon Mega man who will be able to make sure the killer of the world is not responsible for any reason that the government has Gregory Peck<br /> and Audrey Hepburn meets Annebeth Chase with Percy Jackson
B00CJKW4WQ|1.0|it constantly goes into sleep mode and is SLOW to wake up. would like to return it if i could...
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|I was open minded about this album, I kinda liked applause the first single, wasn't hyped about it, but it is little bit catchy, of course I had to give a try when I heard gaga was naming this album of the millenium and how artsy and how much soul and hard work she put into not to mention it took her like 2 years to create this<br /><br />I can only call this creation a disaster, It has zero good songs, none whatsoever, all of them are below average, I give props to production, the guys who did producing did a decent job, except for venus<br /><br />What also troubles me is the fact she is claiming to be high art and talented and original, 2 of the albums songs are blatant rip offs and album as a whole is as generic as it can get and the fact is that she is asking to buy her songs multiple times and watch her videos multiple times just to gain more popularity on charts and at the same time saying she does not care about chart position, all that is just pathetic<br /><br />this is artpoop or artflop, not artpop
B00ARI9CDQ|1.0|Downloaded the app as every time I went on to the website the website would freeze and prompt me to download the app.  Now the app has stopped working and the website still prompts me to download the app so neither work.  Guess I will not be getting my news from the daily mail any longer.
B007SGLZP8|2.0|Boring. Hard to keep me interested.  Glad I used the library, instead of purchasing. Story jumped around & had lots of holes.
B00CKJ2KK2|5.0|In order to find the gyroscope button you need to go to the settings in the top right corner of the screen and go to the screen settings and from there you should be able to turn it on.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|What a great story  and so good to have Jake, Lucien et all back for the next installment.<br />Always told w empathy, humor, suspense---valuable teaching moments
B004X6PRO6|4.0|It reads like a science fiction novel. The rise of to poor to richness, the loss of values. Regain of pride even if the result is death. Non beings in concentration camps, corruption, abduction in neighboring countries. Love. The total ignorance concerning the US and its mores. Yes, this is a magic reality novel but sadly well founded in the realities of the Hermit Kingdom.
B001DM1VXE|4.0|Eraser Head. Black and White. Great Cast. Well Done. 3.14159265359....... a mathematical constant that is the ratio of a circle circumference to it's diameter.
B000XUBFE2|5.0|The book/movie is not heavily involved in the destruction of the Jews of Europe, or the guilt of Germany.  It is rather the simple story of a sensitive teenager given up by her mother for economic or political reasons (no clear reason given) and how she and her adoptive parents face the war, anti-Semitism, and just plain human pain.<br />I really enjoyed both the book and the movie, and highly recommend it as an excellent story and good insight into the life of common people in Nazi Germany.
B00FAPF5U0|4.0|one of those game that everybody is playing. not hard to play can be enjoyed by people of any age group
B00FWLSLJ4|5.0|It's like transformers! The special effects are really amazing! I can't wait for part two to come out!  I love sifi action!
B00DR0PDNE|3.0|Works fine. But, does not stream Amazon prime. Already get netflix with my dvd player. Disapointed and giving it away.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|Another thriller set in Clanton, Mississippi that shows his understanding and interpretations of life in the South in the mid 1980s.
B000FBJAEG|4.0|Very exciting and fast paced. Although, a couple of the players didn't quite fit right. Seemed to just be there without much background support for the role.
B00AREIAI8|3.0|It's a good game but it's not fun it's a game were u do advancements but I still recommend getting this game
B00BQHA06A|5.0|At first i hated this cd. im a huge fan of H.I.M. and i was extreemely disappointed. BUT... i actually gave the WHOLE CD a listen one day and it grew on me. this is probably their best Cd in recent years but i and a ton of other fans would still love to hear that old sound soon maybe?
B00FRQ32N4|5.0|My son enjoys it and has not stop playing this game.  It has great moves and easy upgrades.  It's worth downloading.
B0091VTISO|1.0|Bad movie bad remade the story line was very poor the first one was bad enough why try  another one
B00EUS9JF0|5.0|Macca's writing, signature voice, and ROCKIN' band made this a real music 'ear candy treat' with his Nu music~I liked he different chord choices, and the various  producers (some young n older) adding their magical 'twists' to great material, from a SUPERSTAR talent! ~ LOVED IT!!! ♥♪♫♪
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Besides there only being 5 lives I really enjoy candy crush.  I love to escape into game world with this one, fun for everyone.
630587493X|3.0|I don't want to say that this is the best movie of all time, because sometimes the gags are repetative and I feel that there were points in the movie that weren't developed enough. For example, there is not a lot of time spent developing the family that Andrew serves, so when they start dying, I don't feel a huge tug in my heart like I'd hope for.<br /><br />That being said there are so many life topics discussed in this movie and that's why I love it. Bicentennial Man explores what it really means to be human, which I feel makes this movie worthwhile. There aren't many movies anymore that dwell into deep topics.
B00DGNO3WE|5.0|Great story line and the actors gave an entertaining and quality performance.  Funny and dramatic.  Wish I could retire there.
B008NCSZQ8|5.0|good movie.  I had watched it previously on my TV but at the time I wanted to watch some movies, it had already been claimed.  Watched it on my PC and was satisfied with it.
B00881VLCE|5.0|I like it!  It is fun and mind stimulating.  It helps with eye coordination and concentration.  I like the scenery of each of the puzzles.
B005MMY9A8|5.0|Good stuff. I decided to watch it before I went and watched the second.  it was worth it. blah blah
B00BB8SKPW|4.0|Nice yarn with a twist that will keep you in the movie till the end.  Hopefully some will watch and learn how addictive alcohol can be
B00DYCBH4O|5.0|It has the best opening ever. It is truth universally acknowledged that a single man in possession of a good fortune must be in want of a wife..
B00CNQ7CRI|3.0|Some things don't improve with age.  Bridget  Jones was the classic singleton of the 90s, but 15 years later as a single mom, she hasn't grown up much and it's pretty sad.  Everything works out in the end, but the plot is stretched pretty thin.
B00406O7YK|4.0|A great, large scale musical worth seeing again.  While the music, outside of Hello Dolly sung by Louis Armstrong, is not that memorable, it is worth seeing just for the late 1800's wardrobe and set design.
B00E34A9FU|4.0|One of the best live Dead recordings that I have heard.  High quality sound which is amazing in its own right from a 1972 concert. The DVD is a great visual of this classic Dead concert. This CD and DVD set is a must have for the Deadhead.
B00B5HQLMI|4.0|Good Jame's Bond action as expected. Plot somewhat contrived, aren't they all, but this one a little more than usual.
B00BWBHIUG|4.0|Nemo's Reef is cute and fun to play. Child must know how to read to find items. This is a very enjoyable game.
B00000DFTG|5.0|While I am not a huge fan of lots of live albums that bands seem to release with every tour, this album is exceptional. It has a special magic being recorded in Birmingham. This album showcases the magic that these four people have when playing this material together, The music sounds the way it is meant to.
B00FRQ32N4|1.0|Can't really rate it. It still has not downloaded fully and it is two days later! It is the app not my phone taking so long.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Why books like these aren't taught in school I'll never know. Romeo and Juliet is a story of naive children believing they have loved. This is a story of children who have lived with death all around them, and the only way they have survived is through love.
B005XN31LY|3.0|Soap opera with a sprinkling of fairy dust. Dust helps but not enough to save the series. I won't bother with another season.
B001XV3LSS|5.0|The story was terrific.  The acting was outstanding and the ending was so unexpected that it really made you think!
B0034G4OYA|5.0|I have recorded this on direct TV and I love the movie so I had to order it. I love the move and cartoons in general.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|This third book started out much more promising than the second. The characters were more developed, less annoying and dramatic...and then the end of the book ruined the series for me. I won't spoil what happened, but this third book had the potential to redeem itself from the second and it tanked in my opinion due to the author's decision to eliminate one of the characters.
B00000612P|5.0|Something else I do not loan out. Good music. Must hide to keep as someone will try and take what is not theirs.
B001ANYDAO|5.0|This book really makes you view the successful in a much different way. A Very entertaining and thought provoking read.
B00AZMFJYA|5.0|Wonderful acting all around. Good for Trekkies or non-Trekkies. Special effects are wonderful, and Benedict Cumberbatch makes a most excellent villain.
B00G9B1MEM|5.0|Cute animation and really challenging.  Bright colors and fun little guys coming at you fast and furious.  Well worth the cost.
B005544TRQ|3.0|Smart entertainment like the movie references. The men look smokin hot in the suits. Story line keeps you guessing all the time
B00FQPHOPI|5.0|Great story of Superman's origins. Showing the story of his father and mother and why Clark Kent was so powerful. Great acting, great lines. Can't wait for the follow up
B00ARA4SLU|2.0|Anthony Hopkins just phoned in this performance (if you want to call it that) without even trying to mimic Hitch's distinct voice. As another reviewer said, Toby Jones did a much better job, spot on, actually with the accent. And though he's a very small actor, Jones really caputured his character. Because of Hopkins' terrible acting, just couldn't get into the movie, didn't really care. Could have been interesting. 2-stars for production values.
B00F91RYL8|4.0|I gave WWZ four stars because I really like zombie movies and it should have gotten all five with Brad Pitt in it but in my opinion he didn't live up to all the press he has been getting. I know that's not fair but if you're in every mag in the Doc's waiting room and news stand you've got a lot to live up to.<br />Sorry Brad but if you're gonna be a Super Star on and off the screen, you've got to amp up the acting or tone it down at home.<br /> Thanks for your attention and please do something good for an animal, it'll make you both feel better.  Mr. Goodcat.
B00B7NPRY8|5.0|A pillar of science fiction and a must read for any fans of the genre. I now want to go consume all the books even though I've been told they aren't as good.
B00DQC2FPM|5.0|This 80's retro LEGO set is immediately one of my favorites.  It is quite possibly the best LEGO set made to date.
1439190275|5.0|I lost 18lbs using this book and following the guidelines.  You kind of havemto piece toghether your own plan, they dont give you what to eat exactly, which I liked, but it doesmtake a littlemplanning
B006MW3UZW|4.0|Excellent show. Great scenery, great characters, great acting.<br />We are trying to catch up for the new season coming up.
B002MQYOFW|5.0|Even the second time through I couldn't put it down!<br />Glad I can jump right in to the next one.
0552991228|5.0|This is a classic. Every young doctor or medical student should read it! I gave a copy to the medical students I teach.
B005LAIHY0|1.0|HD remake of ALIEN. Buy the Alien movies instead. Very long and for a remake. Long and drawn out reminds me of 2001 but with gore.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|I think I was initially attracted to the chromecast for it's aesthetic promise.  I loved the idea of a media device that disappeared entirely from view.  I purchased it primarily to see if it would be something my parents would use and compared it to a Roku and an apple tv.<br /><br />The aesthetic promise is quickly lost when I have extra cables dangling out of the chromecast to power the small device.  I know some got lucky that it was actually powered by the hdmi port itself, but I have a relatively new quality tv and it could not power it.<br /><br />The ease of use purported by making your other devices the remote also gets lost quickly since I've lost the attraction to phones as remotes and laptops as remotes since the benefit of having a physical remote to pick up quickly, barely look at, to either stop or lower the volume is immeasurable.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|I love all John Grisham books and this one was no different.  I couldn't stop reading it.  There were twists at every turn.  Very suspenseful.
B00B2166BS|1.0|The cable developed an intermittent connection issue just after the 90 days was up on the warrantee. The cable had been seeing very light usage and was not stressed in any way. The seller would not replace. I would not recommend this to anyone.
B00CH26TL8|4.0|Not enough lives. Takes too long to regain lives. Game should allow you to switch more bubbles in the Calderon
B00499QUK2|5.0|No doubt about it - to me this is the greatest series on television. Exciting, intriguing, surprising - GREAT acting and narratives! Cannot wait for Season 3 - afraid that it may be the last, now that Cumberbatch and Freeman have become superstars!
0545586178|5.0|Got this book for the wife before the movie came out. I was a bit upset it took a bit long to get to me being a prime member but I guess they were having issues. As far as the book all I can tell you or came in perfect condition. I'll update when she finishes reading it.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Warning: Spoiler Alert! Ms. Roth asks us to suspend our misbeliefs throughout her series but chooses to force us back into reality for, what I am sure, she felt was a more believable ending. When we got pulled into the story of Tris and Tobias, with Divergent, we were clearly not looking for a harsh and realistic ending. Something more romantic would have felt much better. Clearly, we had already learned the lesson that sometimes life is not fair and/or what you expect throughout the series so to finish the entire process with a slap in the face was just not necessary. It makes me not even want to see the movies because I won't be able to forget how it ends!<br /><br />Why would an author choose to go with the method of narrating each chapter from a main character's voice in the 3rd book of a series? The readers were obviously fans of the previous method so why change? It felt like Ms. Roth got cocky and felt she could lead us around by the nose and we would follow wherever she took us. I think she will lose a lot of future readers from this which is sad because it gave, the often hard to please teenagers, something intellectual to read. Now they will just go back to junk like \\"The Hope Series\\".
B009JZSC9S|5.0|I really enjoyed the program.  I found the actors really interesting.  I always looked forward to watching the next program.
B00B0LPYXG|3.0|Easy five stars for the opening crash scene. No disrespect to the writers, actors and all the hundreds of people involved:  but the balance of the movie is a dud.
B00G4CXHSK|3.0|Random Heroes tries to do again what League of Evil did, and fails. Although well executed, it isn't nearly as fun as its predecessor.
B003YL4LYI|5.0|Another piece of compelling storytelling from George R.R. Martin.  Incredible plot twists and a richly detailed world surprise and reward the reader.  A Dance with Dragons is far from perfect, but it remains a pinnacle of this genre that skews much closer to literature than fantasy.  What a ride!  Patience is needed as new characters continue to be introduced, sometimes frustrating readers who want more action.  This installment of the epic A Song of Ice and Fire essentially fills in the &#34;other half&#34; of the action that served as the focus for book 4.  About halfway through this installment the parallel worlds join and the timeline and overall epic storyline advance.  The pace can be slow and complex, but part of what makes reading this series fun is that a reader can not tell what is coming next, and there is bound to be at least one or two truly shocking sequences in store for the persistent reader.
B005LAIH2W|4.0|this was fun, not deep or profound, but that is not what it is meant to be, just a fun action space opera. Better than I expected from the reviews
B0091REZMW|5.0|Very good would recommend to anyone who loves mystery games very fun and take up time u can waste very addictive
B0034G4P80|4.0|another fun action, hero movie, just what you want when you don't want to think too hard and just want to be entertained for a hour or so.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Like all good games you don't need to be connected to Wi-Fi to play this so you can play it at home or anywhere you've a little bit of time to kill and not just places with free Wi-Fi.  A lot of others had been playing and mentioning this game, claiming they were addicted and so forth so I decided to check it out. Best to play with the sound on as then you get the old 80's arcade noise game machine experience (or the same sort of noises and lights as your poker machines, but you don't have to feed coins into this).  Eric Cartman may have made the catchphrase Sweeeeeeeeeeeeettttt catchy in the 90's, but the voice in this one has brought that catchphrase back to popular culture as the game praises a nice move you make that causes the disappearance of a lot of fruit.  That's basically the premise of the game, it's a number of challenges where you need to match up three of the same pieces of fruit which make them disappear.  As the levels go up you have missions to achieve such as getting three objects to the bottom of the screen in a set maximum number of moves so it becomes a bit of a mental challenge.<br /><br />The only thing I don't like about this is If you take a while to think about your next move (or something interesting is happening on the TV while your playing) it prompts you with possible moves, I would love to be able to turn that off as it is cheating after all.  Have a button you press to get a hint if you want but the whole point of a mental challenge is to challenge yourself, so the game could do without the hints.<br /><br />Update March 2014 - When I got to level 130 of Candy Crush (in the Water Wharf area of the map) I had no idea what to do as the order to fulfil is five brown striped balls.  First I assumed it meant the blue lollie ones when striped (after four of one candy in a row turns the candy you slid in to striped after the other three disappear), as they resembled the picture just a different colour. That wasn't it. Then I just assumed it was setting of any stripe.  It wasn't in fact I set off about 30 stipes in one game and really couldn't work out how to get these brown striped candy.  But I worked it out and have come back and typed this into my review so if your searching all reviews with the words level 130 or something you'll know how to do it.<br /><br />What you need to do to win Candy Crush's level 130 is line up two of any striped candies either on top or next to each other.  Then you need to smash these two striped candies together (of course doing this takes out the whole line of candies horizontal and vertical when you do).  You need to do this five times in that game to win in addition to getting the minimum score.  So you line up as many four in a rows as possible and try avoid making the chocolate freckle with five (ignore you natural instinct to create the freckle) in a row by dropping one end of the candy first before dropping the fourth into the middle.  Level 130 is actually quite easy once you know what you are supposed to do.<br /><br />Level 131 however has the same concept but is a lot harder, as you've got the game divided into four boxes, one has chocolate in it and the other a bomb that goes off in ten moves.<br /><br />Hope this info helped you to continue on and eased the fear of what am I going to do now, I've become addicted to this game but can't see any possible way to complete level 130 feeling.was setting of any stripe.

B000002JSP|5.0|not my favorite Zep album, but still great music, still like the early stuff best, but still better than most new stuff out there.
B004SJ3BCI|4.0|The game is engaging because analyzing failed attempts shows me how to create a successful strategy.  I gave 4 instead of 5 stars because when I play on my 7 inch tablet,the farthest targets at the smallest size do not fit into the screen.  I must guess at the trajectory that will make the hit.
B00GH4R95C|5.0|Loved this movie, has everything u want, love the throwback to the original<br />Im sure purist hated it but compared to original this one holds up
B00B0LPWU6|4.0|Entertaining, Exciting, and Electrifying.  Worth the view during an otherwise drab week. DW movies are always worth the price  of admission.
B005MLOKXA|5.0|This is probably the most intelligent and interesting TV series I have ever watched.  Lawyers are interesting  because of the infinite vaariety of cases they get involved in.  The writers have made them into a variety of characters with an assortment of persnalities that keep me wanting more.  I hope this program runs forever!!
B00ECU34ZM|4.0|A good  film with a solid plot and good acting. I am not a Cruise fan (on or off screen) but the man knows how to pull off a movie like this. Does the man age at all? Excellent camera and special effects. All in all, an enjoyable competent film.
B002VRZEYM|4.0|Informative....should influences your purchases.  Provides many reasons why you should buy locally, get to know the farmers in your region, and where their products are processed.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|As many others have stated, I dont like the way that the author ended this trilogy.  The first two books were interesting and captured my attention and heart.  I enjoy reading for the nuggets within a well-written book (example - &#34;people, even genetically damaged people, make choices. that's what matters&#34;).<br />It may take a while for me to reread and process the ending to see if I can grasp why Roth chose the ending that she did instead of a feel-good ending.
B00BJ9VBLI|5.0|This game is so much fun and can be played many times.  I would recomend this to anyone who loves matching 3 or more jewels and then play a side game.
B00B0LPWU6|1.0|*** Mediocre at Best  *** Waste of Time ***<br /> It's a  unrealistic plot, and silly screen play...<br />They have stretched the story line well passed<br />any point of reality... There is no moral, or social<br />lesson, to learn...  It's simply  an unbelievable<br />\\"plot\\", from start to finish... You just keep<br />waiting for this movie to improve, but it doesn't...<br />It's like the \\"writer's\\" were on the \\"Crack Pipe\\",<br />not the pilot... This movie make's Madagascar 3,<br />seem like an \\" Animal Rights Docudrama\\"...<br />*** Border Line 1 Star Movie ***<br />*** Simply Over Done ***
B008JGSM6G|5.0|I just really enjoyed playing this.  There are even challenging levels.  My 5 year old grandson loves playing this and is very good at it.
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|I love the show! I can't wait to watch the next episode and see what will happen next. It has become like my new soap opera.
B0050DZ8J0|1.0|This is not the normal &#34;Facebook&#34; type.  It didn't impress me at all to use it nor did I feel that it was worth going online to use it.

B00FAPF5U0|5.0|love it love it love it.  So much fun and can also be used with the facebook version.  Many levels to play for a very long time!
B00BAXFECK|5.0|Brava Donna Tartt:  I was sad to finish this book; a page-turner and a modern homage to Dickens.  Marvelous, unforgettable characters:  Theo, Boris, Hobie, Mrs. Barbour, and even the dog Popchyk.
B000JMKTLO|4.0|I have found that Gillian Flynn does not pull punches with her characters. They are so flawed that at times they might even be hard to like. While in other novels I’ve read characters might have a slight personality flaw or some baggage from their past Gillian Flynn says nope that isn’t interesting enough and she turns the volume on her characters issues up to 11.<br /><br />Camille, now a reporter in Chicago, came from a small town and a very dysfunctional family. She lost her sister tragically when she was thirteen and that is when she started acting out. You would think that now that she is almost thirty she would have worked most of that out, but she hasn’t and it has taken a toll on her life and her body. Camille is a cutter and not just a simple cutter no she goes to extremes and has words on almost every inch of her body that she has been cutting into herself over the last fourteen years.<br /><br />Over the years I’ve made my own private jokes. You can really read me. Do you want me to spell it out for you? I’ve certainly given myself a life sentence.<br /><br />Newly in recovery after a stint in a mental hospital she travels back to her home town to cover the murders of a few young girls in town. But staying with her mother and half-sister is harder then she thought it would be. Thrust back into her old life she must again deal with the death of her younger sister and try to discover who killed two other girls in her home town.<br /><br />This is a dark book full of flawed characters. It shows a very unapologetic side of addictions, self-deprecation and cruelty. Camille’s mother Adora is a special kind of crazy and her half-sister Amma is a chameleon shedding personalities depending on who she is playing the part for. She plays the good little girl acting younger than thirteen for her mother but the town knows her as a promiscuous and conniving teen that controls her friends and enemies with fear, sex and drugs. Both women may drive Camille back to her cutting tendencies if she can’t finish up and escape their torment.<br /><br />As flawed and broken as Camille is, I still really liked her most of the time. I wanted her to find the killer, escape her family, get the big story and win the heart of the cute detective Richard who was working on the case. I teetered with who I thought the killer was and while parts turned out like I expected there were enough surprised to keep me interested in the story.<br /><br />This isn’t a HEA kind of book but I really liked the resolution to the story. It was well thought out and perfect in its own way. With a mystery that is about as much as I can say without giving away the meat of the novel.

It isn’t very long and the story progresses quickly enough.to her cutting tendencies if she can’t finish up and escape their torment.<br /><br />As flawed and broken as Camille is, I still really liked her most of the time. I wanted her to find the killer, escape her family, get the big story and win the heart of the cute detective Richard who was working on the case.

B00EEPFLHE|5.0|Rock at it's absolute best. Stryper puts an exclamation point on it's 30 year history with No More Hell to Pay. A cd of new material with relevant lyrics and face melter guitars. Listen and enjoy
B000SEGUDE|4.0|The book was complicated at times but had interesting themes  I enjoyed puzzling out the interaction of the characters in a non-linear time frame.
B0068TJLSY|4.0|The movie moved along at a fast past and took awhile to let the viewer know exactly what was happening - made it suspenseful and fun.
B009UX2YAC|5.0|This game is awesome it is totally worth the download.  Remember that you can update it every month!!  There is a game guide if u dont get the game:)  &lt;3 the game
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The first two were far superior. I wasn't thrilled with the examples/explanations of morality, the lack of peripheral character development or attempts to change narrator voices (both sounded the same making it easy to forget who was speaking). But, still an easy read and an ambitious subject matter to tie up neatly in a trilogy, so I didn't hate it.
B00GH4RKYM|5.0|Superb! In every way. Russell Crow is fantastic, as usual, Kevin Coster is too. All star cast, superbly written, action packed, great 1st rate graphics, great plot. What more do you want. Love the way they updated everything plot wise, Krypton is truly a distant planet, and they spent ,more time there, which i love. The whole movie is so well thought out. Only wish they had a little more time with Kevin Coster and Diane Lane, but it is a wonderful movie.
B009KS4XRO|5.0|I enjoy this game . I play it every morning to start my day. It gives me something to look forward to.
B001EC2J20|5.0|one of the best scifi action movies ever. like most of the middle children in a trilogy, it let's it all hang out.
1608871827|5.0|I absolutely loved this book and it exceeded my expectations. So many beautiful pictures and inside depth of the making of Pacific Rim. A must have for fans of the movie!
B008UCJ7KO|5.0|It is going to be hard to wait for the next book in this series!  It was hard to put it down, the suspense and passion made this book a must read!
0062082841|5.0|A must-read for anyone who's a fan of Del Toro's work! So many beautiful illustrations, inside depth and the sheer size of the book itself literally blew my breath away. This is one of the best and most beautiful books I've read! A masterpiece of it's kind!
B003G4W49C|5.0|I usually don't like to read but I loved this book it was the best book I ever read and I can't wait to see the movie
B00CH87HF4|5.0|Many people complain about how long it takes to get the best armor but it takes time and dedication to get to those ranks. Overall this game is a must have and I love that it's not energy based so you can play as long as you want.
B00GHJ6BJW|5.0|The more you listen to the album, the better it gets. I love the variety of the songs. This album kicks the ass of that POS album by Katy Perry...
B00CWVF2GC|5.0|Great Follow up from the original Yossi & Jagger, 10 years after the first movie. Very Emotional, Funny, Sexy... another great Eytan Fox movie.
B00DR0PDNE|2.0|chromecast only works with 3-4 apps that google has allowed them to be used to cast the video to your TV so that was a big minus for me. also quality of video is decent but you can tell is not smooth as it should be. I returned the product after 1 day... google did a good job at making it seem better than what it is on their TV commercials.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|Excellent product for me. This is the best calculator I have used. I love the memory and that it even shows prior calculations at a touch.
B007ZGBZHE|3.0|The saga of Aloysius X.L. Pendergast grows ever more convoluted. This volume adds about, oh, a dozen new twists to the character background. Without spoiling anything, we see Pendergast way out of character early on in the book - distraught and bedraggled, and grimly fatalistic. It takes some heroic intervention by his old friends and a fresh new (and utterly horrific case) to rouse him from his torpor, and then he's up and in action.<br /><br />The main thread revolves around a typical Pendergastian mystery - buried secrets, familial shame, horrible science experiments. These are all well and good. Where Two Graves falters is in its side plots. D'Agosta's and Corrie's stories are awkwardly inserted and both seem to end abruptly. In D'Agosta's case, it just disappears midway through.<br /><br />A semisolid read. Worth it for Pendergast fans. Not Preston and Child's best work.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Watch this then the first. Loved it, kids loved it. Pixar does it again. Probably not as good as the first, but I mean you get to see how it all started.
B001L1S1SK|5.0|I love this show. I used to order the DVDs from netflix back in the day when it was not available on stream. It is definitely one of my favorite shows. When getting close to the end of second season, i decided i was going to be impatient and order the entire season from amazon. It was a great price and i was able to enjoy it without waiting for the next DVD to arrive.
B00G4I1CLS|4.0|BLACKFISH is an important documentary about the lives of killer whales in captivity.  I found the documentary a good but not great warning that whales are not meant to live outside their natural enviroments and when they are placed in parks for the entertainment of humans tragedy can happen.  This film focuses in on one of the most recent tragedies of the death of a Sea World Orlando trainer who was killed by an Orca who had previous behavioral problems.<br /><br />I am a fan of these types of documentaries because the most important voice an individual can express is in what they consume or, in general, what we spend our money on.  If we continue to go to parks such as the Sea Worlds we are participating in the continuation of herding young whales and dolphins into enviroments that are unnatural and dangerous for both the trainers and the mammals they train.<br /><br />The only fault I found in this documentary was that is was not harsh enough in its portrayal of the effects these type of shows have on the animals.  I felt there should have been more history and more facts that really argue that aquarium parks need to outlaw, not only the Orca whale shows, but also the dolphin shows, as they are seriously inhumane and cause mental stress and illness to the creatures who are confined to small quarters and live out their lives in a depressive and hurtful enviroments.<br /><br />I felt very sorry for the trainer(s) that were injured and brutally killed by dysfunctional killer whales but I felt sorrier for the animals themselves who are at the mercy of people whose priority is making money at any cost.  There are other ways to show young people what treasures every animal on the planet is and it is not by making some of them clowns in a sick water circus.
B00BAXFCPO|5.0|This book is very informative.  I now have hope that I can be in control of my destiny.  My mother is 96 and has dementia and my father died at 80 with Alzheimer's.  Thank you Dr. Perlmutter for publishing this book!
B001AH6ZWY|5.0|Love it - I've watched it numerous times and still love it. Great part of any sci fi collection. Enjoy!
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Great book!! Lots of shockers! One of the best series I have read! Can't wait for the movie  ahh ahh
B000FC1MM8|4.0|I like the character, Harry Bosch, and in this novel we begin to see even more  sides of him.  There more extreems in emotions from him then I remember from other stories.  I liked getting to know this character more and the multiple relationships that are developed.  As with most Michael Connely novels, the story is slow at first but picks up speed to the final conclusion.  If there was less description of LA and surrounding areas I would have given 5 stars
0394800184|5.0|I grew up with this book, and now my baby loves it.  A classic I love having in the collection
0061148512|5.0|An amazing read. You have to be really patient with it and give it a lot of thought, but it is completely worth it. I was struggling with my Bipolar Disorder an coping with the realization of it all. This book spoke volumes to me and actually comforted me. I felt Esther's pain and I was able to heal through her.
1450419895|5.0|This book is an excellent extension to &#34;Workout I.&#34;  I also think it provides more detail and is better illustrated.  If you liked the first book, you will love this one.
B000I55YV2|5.0|Exciting  on the edge of your seat type movie. Lots of twists  and not predictable. A very clever ending. Mark Walberg is very touching.
B000H5TVJY|5.0|Amazing! Bale gives possibly the best performance of his career. One of the best book to movie adaptations ever made. Funny, gory, clever, well written dialogue and fantastic acting.<br /><br />(Not for everyone. If you don't like violence and nudity or you are easily offended then don't watch R rated movies. Nobody wants to hear you complain about violence in a movie that has the word psycho in the tittle.)
B00AFROVQC|3.0|I purchased this book to be entertained and that is exactly what it did. The story move at a good pace with likable characters. I have already purchased other books in the series.
B00ENNA62W|5.0|Finally for the first time since VHS the original 1988 streamline english dub has returned! I have been waiting for 12 years. I own three different copies of Akira on dvd that I hoped would contain the original dub and now I have it on DVD and blu-ray. Akira is back!
630542828X|5.0|Excellent Book.  I need to watch the movie and write  a review and I order the movie at the last second possible, and this company sent it to me in less than 48hrs.<br /><br />Excellent Customer Service!
B00BD99JMW|3.0|Even minus the controversial choice the author made (which I actually liked), the book was slow and boring. I was quite disappointed.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|It was a disappointing conclusion to the series.  The plot was all over the place and yet it seemed to go nowhere.
B00B0LPWU6|5.0|Denzel Washington is near the top of my fave actors.  The way the events unfold are a shock to the senses, but believable.  The moral lessons are obvious and the story ends appropriately.  Enjoy it for what it is.
B00FXMGI0G|5.0|Great entertainment! Great casting and the characters are just plain funny! Love Sarah (Mary-Louise Parker's character)complaining \\"No one ever called me Frank Moses' kryptonite.\\" There's Marvin's (John Malkovich's) infamous line, \\"Well, she has a key but not the key\\" and then watch Catherine Zeta-Jones' character getting manhandled down the stairs. Never seen so much serious humor in one film.
B0089LOG02|4.0|An illuminating chapter of American history and compelling story that spans from 1929 to 2011.  I had never heard of the Orphan Trains that carried over 200 children to Minnesota to find homes.  Great read!  I would recommend it.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I was absolutely I love with the series until this book. Now in disappointed. It's written from tris and Tobias's points of veiw all so the writer can ruin the ending and piss everyone off. For what? So she can say she's artsy and dosnt write happy endings. No. stupid.
B006OOHYIC|5.0|I have downloaded all 3 of the quell games in the last week. The music is really relaxing and yet the games challenge my mind. I absolutely love them.
B004GHNIRK|4.0|I'm 12 so I didn't really understand the book. Other than that it was good. I wanted to rate it because it was a good book.
B003O86FMW|4.0|It's a good book but I thought the first one was better. Still a fan and looking forward to the movie.
0316067601|5.0|Great book! Couldn't stop reading it. Amazing what this solider went thru. Best Navy Seal book I've ever read. It's a must read
B00BD99JMW|4.0|Really loved the first two books, this one was a little slower with less action to the other two, and if I’m being honest I hated the ending. Yes it was unexpected and different from recent dystopian novels that are popular right now, but I just didn’t like it at all. It’s a good read and you’ll definitely want to pick it up if you read the first two, but don’t be expecting a fairy tale ending!
B001AMNL2Q|5.0|I watched this after I went thru BCT/AIT in the Army, man it made me thankful for all those who've served before me! Anyways, the movie is comprised of 2 parts-the 1st part being of BCT in the Marines during Vietnam, and it is a very accurate portrail, using a retired Marine SDI to play a SDI in the movie! The second part takes place in Vietnam following Private Joker during his tour. Over all it's a great movie and I highly recommend it to anyone.
B00AE1P8UM|4.0|Very well written, informative read.  The author gives lots of tips and practical exercises.  I have read it few times at there is so much that needs to sink in.
B004RJMUJO|4.0|Great game to play very addicting honestly I don't know because I have to rate it before I can play it
B001UV4XIS|5.0|Hard to swallow ending for the troupe of detectives. As good as it gets story wise, but the cinematography was dark and hard to make out at times.
B00881VLCE|4.0|Great game to play very addicting honestly I don't know because I have to rate it before I can play it
B005544TRQ|5.0|Great show! Very deep and it keeps you guessing, everyone should check it out! Acting is pretty top notch as well.

B00AWFEBDK|4.0|He puts a lot of pieces of our social puzzle together, makes a lot of good points, and suggestions to. If you got the time, you should definitely read
B00B7FOQCK|5.0|I use a desktop and it is hard to plug in USB 3 devices in the back.  With this hub I can have the capability to use the full speed of USB 3 without having to get on my knees and plug them into the back of the computer.
B00DL2W7Q4|4.0|I like it, glad I read it, but the story flow could have been better towards the second half. If you already read his other books, your expectations are going to be too high.
B007ZGO7EM|5.0|It's a calculator....big, easy to read, no glitches that I've noticed. Nice on Kindle. And it's free. Get it. You won't regret it.
B00433SVP6|5.0|Very dynamic story. The Riordan's style mixing a lot of humor, adventure and a lot of Greek Mythology! I missed Percy and mainly Annabeth, but the new heros are also nice. An intereting point regarding this new serie is that it isn't so focused in one hero and his view of the world, now there is a better balance among the demigods. The only thing, is that the new heros could be a little less powerfull! I'd prefer they used magic weapons provided by their parents, than those &#34;natural&#34; gifts of them.
B000OZ0NXA|1.0|For example...Jack hopped on a flight from Atlanta to DC without an ID or credit card?!? Really?  The FBI agent couldnt be stopped by a 44 magnum in his chest...on and on.
B007J4T2G8|1.0|Ever though the story is well written it is just a pornographic novel degrading women. I won't waste my time reading the other books.
B00CH3DBNQ|5.0|She is a remarkable girl.  It's too bad that adults aren't as passionate about education, even though she risks her life, as she is.
B00D6SBOWG|1.0|Whipped thru first levels in an hour or so. To move on you had to buy it.  Not worth the download time an  certainly not worth paying for
B0095D4SCE|3.0|The movie was very choppy during playback; Did not appear to be HD.  I did not have a great experience watching this movie.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|In anticipation for Allegiant appearing in my Kindle on Allegiant's release date, I read through Divergent and Insurgent a second time. The first annoyance with the book for me was the current trend of writing in two voices. If an author is going to do that, I shouldn't have to look backwards to remind myself whose voice is speaking. Tobias and Tris didn't have distinctive styles of communicating, so I found it annoying. While reading the book I also had other images of stories or films popping into my thoughts; The Truman movie was one.<br /><br />I also had some character problems. I didn't think the older characters were justly addressed and all the new ones didn't seem fully developed. The treatment by the community of the Divergent members was never clarified to my satisfaction, especially with the &#34;big brother&#34; eyes. I liked the genetic manipulation angle to the story, but I'm not sure how the targeted audience is going to receive it or even begin to understand it. ( I work as a substitute with middle school children daily, and  frequently read what's trending among them.) What crystalized my negative feelings about the book was its ending. It was not necessary, nor was is satisfactory to end it the way it does. (I was fine with the MockingJay ending.)<br /><br />Since reading the book, I have stopped suggesting Insurgent to the thousands of middle school kids I come into contact with. The book needed more time in the editing room.
B00EW9GQR6|5.0|I love this CD, it's just wonderful well done Gaga, good work <3 you must buy this now or you're going to sorry this some years later
B007MJ9LA2|5.0|luv santana, so anything he has put out i have purchased.  great music for any crowd, non offensive, easy listening and a good mix of upbeat music
B00AEJM6H2|5.0|It's addictive, aggravating and fun.  Very similar to the &#34;original&#34; jewel game.  I would recommend it if you like matching games.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is a very addicting game. I catch myself checking my phone and my Kindle to see if I have any &#34;lives&#34; to play. Some levels are just a pain.
B00BJ9VBLI|4.0|I like the fact that there are different objects to match in each game...it's not the same thing over and over again.  It would be nice if they offered more free levels.
B00G9U7R2O|5.0|Very good movie for everyone. When we rented it we had a 4 day rental and my 2 year old wanted to watch it everyday. I didn't mind watching it along with her.
B009HUB40Y|3.0|The jewels jiggle and &#34;vibrate&#34; alot- it's distracting and annoying.  Other than that, it's about the same as other jewel games.
B001KX50BK|5.0|It does not look like it has been updated to HD, at least most scenes.  However, it is the original theatrical version which is great.  I do hope that Disney eventually releases at true HD version. Maybe they will do it for the 25th Anniversary in 2015.
B00ELE8D4Q|3.0|Sounds like outtakes from her last couple of dance oriented, vocoder music.  Not that there's anything wrong with that, ... but I really expected a lot better.
B00FEHXISA|1.0|If you saw the last Iron Man, you've pretty much seen this one. The one bright spot is Ben Kingsley.
B000OCXIDK|5.0|Enjoyed it throughout!  Good historical fiction.  A good book that kept me engrossed & up at night wondering what happens next  got me interested in wearing my pearl earring which I thought out of date
B0065CCM76|5.0|I have always loved Bob Seger but lost all he records I had of his, so it's nice to be able to get all his greatest his on my mp3 player. I have missed all of his songs. Great music!

B00D7NWTSI|5.0|I always love Iron Man and this was not a disappointment!  I bought it for my husband and he loved the 3D too!
B009UX2YAC|4.0|I wish this updated quickly, I was on an older version for the longest time until my friend informed me to upgrade.
B005LAIHAE|3.0|I watched the movie, as a fan of Henry Cavill, and I enjoyed it, despite the action flummoxing me quite completely. The plot is extremely complex and reading over Wikipedia's thorough recital of it still leaves me perplexed. The secret in the briefcase (any really precise idea of which the film never reveals) has something to do with the Zionist Rogue Mini-State (so-called \\"Israel\\"). That nation is wickedly worthless and the AmeriKKKans have wasted themselves in money, reputation (for the worse), blood, and resources, becoming an enemy of peace and justice, over recent decades of history in in bucking up the Zionist Entity. Alas, the \\"good guys\\", in this cinematic fiction, somehow are doing just that in this film. If I were Henry, I would have been happy for the Arabs (or other opponents, whose number is legion, of the Jewish Theocratic Mini-State) to obtain information that would help the enemies of the perpetually disreputable Zionists.<br /><br />Anyway, as perplexed as this movie leaves me, I still enjoy the Spanish scenery and the fast action, which Cavill handles magnificently, while he (a British actor) conveys the accent of North American English as idiomatically and convincingly as any reasonably well educated AmeriKKKan white guy born and raised in, say, Salt Lake City or Minneapolis. It's worth seeing, even without understanding much, and despite that wasted sympathy for the Zionists, very largely thanks to Henry Cavill.

B00BD99JMW|5.0|I have never been so emotionally attached to fictional characters. I was happy when they were happy and oh so sad when they were sad. &#34;Allegiant&#34; the 3rd book of the &#34;Divergent&#34; trilogy was an emotional roller-coaster. I enjoyed reading the story from both the perspective of Tris and Four. While the story did not end the way I had hoped. I was captured hook, line and sinker throughout. Veronica Roth is to be commended for spinning such an enchanting tale.
B007IQWQ88|5.0|Karajan was often accused of being slick or glib, searching for surface beauty while shortchanging emotional depth. These accusations are sometimes true considering his later work (1970s on), but in his prime during the 60s, Karajan married astoundingly beautiful and precise playing from the Berliners to vigorous, committed interpretations. There's a reason Karajan was the most famous conductor of his generation--the Beethoven, Brahms, Strauss (J and R), Tchaikovsky, Dvorak, Sibelius, Debussy, Ravel (Karajan was surprisingly good at French music) and Bruckner here rank among the best recorded. There are only a few outright duds: the Rite of Spring whose &#34;tempo di hoochie-coochie&#34; Stravinsky famously mocked, the blatty, rushed Schubert 9 (which is actually rather entertaining in a perverse way), the antiquated Bach and Handel, the rushed Pastoral, and the slack Mozart Requiem. In addition, the concerti included here are not terribly special, as Karajan tended to choose reticent soloists who didn't clash with his enormous musical personality (the Dvorak Cello Concerto with Rostropovich and Tchaikovsky Piano Concerto with Richter are exceptions, of course). I'm not going to go into more detail about the performances here, as just about all of them have been reviewed separately on Amazon.  DG's sonic work for Karajan and the BPO was rather inconsistent during the 60s. The sonics were never truly bad, but neither were they up to the excellent standard that RCA and Decca were setting at the time. The venue used for recording, the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, had pleasantly warm, reverberant acoustics, and although the engineers didn't always do a good job capturing them, nothing here sounds boxy or constricted. The Beethoven cycle received some of the worst engineering, with strings too far forward in the mix (consequently sounding rather harsh), recessed winds and brass, muddy timpani, and boomy bass. Most of the other items here sound substantially better, although the brass sometimes sound blatty or braying, and compared to the admittedly rather few Karajan LPs I own, some of the digital transfers are deficient in upper treble. The later recordings here do sound very good, and it's a pity that Karajan switched to EMI right when DG was getting a hang of the Jesus-Christus-Kirche, and then switched to recording in the inferior acoustics of the Philharmonie in the mid-70s. DG's Original-Image Bit-Processing remastering usually represents an improvement on earlier Galleria issues, but I hear no difference between the remastering here and DG Originals issues.  Given the excellence of most of the performances in the box, I wouldn't recommend this box just to Karajan completists, but to anyone who wants a solid set of performances of many of the best-loved pieces in the 19th century orchestral repertoire. At $230 for about 50 CDs worth of music (since each CD contains an LP's worth of material, most are not much more than half-full), this is quite a good deal.

B000XUBFE2|5.0|...and would suddenly remember and be surprised.  It took me several pages to get into the rhythm of the narration and figure out what was going on, but I soon got it and then couldn't put it down. It is an amazing look at Death as a character and as a player.  It was of course heartwrenchingly sad as are all novels of the holocaust but it is outstandingly lyrical and lovely as well.  I truly loved it.

B00CH3DBNQ|4.0|I bought this book to support Malala, like so many others did, I suppose.  It was interesting, but heavier on history and lighter on the details of her personal life than I would have preferred.  Still, her life was so entwined with the geography and history of her country, and the many factions and tribes which comprise it, that I think it is an accurate representation of her experience.<br />This is a remarkable story, educational in the way that only travel and learning about other cultures can be. Looking back, I think my expectations of this book were naïve.
B001XUNOSQ|2.0|not that great of a movie expected more from this movie did not meet my expectations did not like animation
B00A285OOW|5.0|Excellent a must read especially if you seen the white queen because it is the sequal... I loved it ... Excellent
B002ZCY7PU|5.0|I love this show, the stories are well written and entertaining, lots of action- great ensemble cast. I like the way the story always ends up at the &#34;Buy More&#34; store where<br />Chuck  works, the characters at the store are hysterical, Especially Jeff and Lester.<br />Of course , Sarah as the beautiful spy adds sex-appeal, and Morgan as Chuck's<br />best friend is great too. The shows are really fun to watch. The third season is<br />one of the best because Chuck gets the new &#34;intersect&#34;  program and can turn into A Kung Foo  Martial arts master in A Flash.
B00F87ZUYG|5.0|This is the best series on TV right now, everyone in my house watches it.  We can not always sit down together so I bought it to watch whenever we want!
B009ZQC7MY|5.0|Great series powerful storyline. A trip back to a more complicated era where manners ruled the day and appearances were paramount.
B002NQ3AAQ|4.0|great feel good movie. good story to encourage anyone to follow their dreams no matter what people think. loved every min of it
B007UXSPK2|4.0|good movie.  not the best ever but a good progression in the series. lots of action good fast passed movie
B00BD99JMW|5.0|Thank you Verona Roth! It takes a special form of bravery to do what you did in this story, I loved it.
B00BATG18K|2.0|I love books on China's culture particularly those dealing with Chinese women. I had forgotten I had read books by this author before.  I was disappointed in this book. It dealt with generations of dysfunctional women in mother daughter relationships as well as dysfunctional families. It was nice it seemed to all work out in the end but I thought the end was a bit oversimplified.  The Book began with the courtesan culture. Part of this had a whole chapter on how to please a man.  The author had already given us a descriptive feel for the courtesan world.  Why this?<br />There were much more interesting plot lines to pursue. Violet went from one dysfunctional relationship to another which got rather redundant. We do read about traditions and obligations to family and ancestors , some about the changing political tide and effects of war and political unrest. These important aspects of Chinese history gets lost in .  This book started out well and went downhill from there. Sorry Amy Tan fans.
B0063M22QO|5.0|Love this game. It is challenging but easy to play.  Clear instructions.  Many different levels to play.  Can become addictive.
B00AXOPK6W|4.0|Illustrations do not add to the reading experience as I have a basic Kindle without color. Otherwise, they might be quite enjoyable. The novel, however, is one of my favorites, and I am pleased to have it in my ereader so that it is available always, in addition to many others.
B00A6CCF0K|5.0|If you loved The Shining\\" you'll totally enjoy finding out what little Danny Torrence is doing now! You'll be sucked right back into the King 's wicked world of \\"shining\\" stars!
B00FJMK9VE|4.0|Best work they have done since To Hell With The Devil.. I am really enjoying this one! I do recommend it to any Believer..
B00EDF43MY|3.0|As with other Dr Panda games, my 4 year old can play this for hours. This proves useful for doctors appointments, and other boring (for kids) moments in life.<br /><br />My only real complaint about the game is that is requires an internet connection. My 4 year old doesn't read yet, so I disable wifi before she gets to play, so she doesn't buy something she shouldn't. If the game is for kids, then turn off requirement for internet access. If that stipulation gets removed with an update, then I will rate at 5 stars.
B008J8KBKY|3.0|It's an OK game, but not for a smaller phone. A larger screen may help, but the board was just too cluttered and I ended up uninstalling after first game.
B00A8ECU24|1.0|I went to install, and my antivirus about blew up from adware. I'm certain my daughter would have loved this, but we will never know.
B008469DGY|4.0|I grabbed this game since I love golf, and since you only get one shot at each hole location, this is a super fast game.<br />My issue, and I could probably just practice more, is that I have only been able to advance so far, and now it is just getting frustrating. I don't play it as much as I used to, so it will always be frustrating, so it will probably get uninstalled the next time I need space.
B00CXVX1OQ|5.0|I think the title says it all. You're a monkey (dressed up in funny clothes) and you get the beat the snot out of other monkeys dressed in even funnier looking clothes.<br /><br />This is also a super fast action game. If you let your guard down, at least in more advanced levels, you will be on the mat in no time. Then you can say/brag/sulk that you were KO'ed by a monkey with a clown nose and mohawk.<br /><br />I think I'll have to go play some more...
B00FAPF5U0|1.0|I wish it would connect to my Facebook account when I play on my kindle fire but when I click &quot;connect to Facebook&quot; it say  it doesn't have access to the kingdom.  Lame.  Please fix this!!
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|This is such a good game. I think that everyone should get it. You all should play this game have fun.
B00BD99JMW|1.0|I felt the book had a horrible ending, sorry folks. She could have done a better job at finishing it.
B007ZGBZHE|4.0|This was a very good read!  I love the Pendergast series.  Action packed and mysterious.  Great book to settle in with..

B0089EHWQE|4.0|really enjoyed story line and the way this book was written.  a real fast read that encouraged me to read another book by autor.
B00AFCEIB0|5.0|I love Google its the best search engine I nrver have a problem with finding things so I use Google
B009C7JS14|4.0|easy to read and shows everything i need-plus easy to check other cities like for trips or vacations or where famiy and friends live
B005J2V74C|2.0|For me, this movie was just your usual run-of-the-mill paranormal scenarios. Fairly predictable; not enough &#34;scary&#34; scenes. The ending was a bit too gruesome, compared to the rest of the movie. Sorry I wasted my time and money.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|I devoured the first two books. loved them. I still haven't finished this book but it is PAINFUL to read. Horrid writing - I don't like the alternating POVs, the story is not advancing. So disappointed.
B00G9U7NEQ|5.0|Absolutely amazing. Dare I say better than the first? This is a great movie for kids of ALL ages (2 to 102).
B002ZB26AO|5.0|This book offers a fascinating, eye-opening and heart-wrenching look inside North Korea. The story is very engaging and so well written.
B009K86D86|5.0|Great movie!  Informative and easy to watch.  With the rise in disease in America, understanding the complexity of how our food is produced is important for making informed decisions for our health.
0790731479|5.0|My grandson told me he wanted the movie...He loves it! He watched it non-stop for hours.<br />It arrived quickly and in perfect condition.
B0036S4B6M|5.0|This was a good read, as someone who works in a men's prison I thought this might be fluff, but considering she was in a low-level facility, with women, it was believable.  I enjoyed the description of the relationships between the women, their status amongst one another, their true feelings and their fears.  This is a story of survival in an adverse environment that no one wants to be in.  I strongly suggest this book.  The TV series goes into more detail regarding the intimate female relationships and cop/inmate tryst which the book doesn't so don't be surprised when you don't find that info in the book.
B007SGLZP8|4.0|Very plausible plot and easy to follow characters. A pleasure to read as always.<br />John Grisham is one of the best mystery writers of our time.
B0052RDHTM|4.0|Definitely Follett style.<br />Had to buy myself the Kindle e-book version in order to finish it.<br />Had received the hard copy version as a Christmas present a while ago but found it overly unconfortable to read in bed - it's a big and heavy book and I'm a spoiled kid who loves the comfort of e-books.
B009NXV2RK|5.0|Great book!!<br />too bad it turned out to be his last one. :(<br />I'll have to look for another author since I read them all.
B001FVV2X2|5.0|I am just addicted to this show. Want more every day. It's unreal but yet very interesting and mind boggling.
B00BD99JMW|2.0|No surprise at all . The thriller is a poor copy from 1984 . Its more of nothing .<br />In my opinion just the first book is enough! Not for really readers.
B00433SVP6|5.0|Amazing! Interesting! Had me hooked till the end! A great installment after the Percy Jackson books! Has to be in the top books I've read!
B00499NHLC|5.0|A few plot flaws, but excellent acting  and pace. Cumberbatch plays Holmes perfectly and makes it all work.  The episode is full of surprises
B003UBTX6S|5.0|I really enjoyed this series! I had all the books read in no time. But be warned after reading the series the movie does no justice! Happy reading! :)
B00FPH6PRK|5.0|Very good story.Suspence from begining to end.They dont make to many good scary movies any more since The exorcist.I would put this next to the amityville
B00BD99JMW|1.0|Very bad ending, quite disappointing. The first two book were very good, the end ruined the entire series for me.
B00B7Y0206|1.0|this is a bad app it does not work on a kindle fire and you cant use it with out witt this is a good app for hd but it is not good for this kind of kindle fire
1451666179|5.0|I'm a big fan of Allie Brosh's blog Hyperbole and a Half, so naturally I preordered her book as soon as I heard it was being released! I was surprised at how much was in it, especially new content. The two part series &#34;Adventures in Depression&#34; are also included which, although I've already read them on her website, was great to see included in the book. The tales are whimsical and entertaining and I finished reading them all in one sitting. It's a great book to keep on your coffee table to entertain guests with while you're doing various things around the house and they wait for you, or to just take a break from your daily happenings to dive into Allie's cartoon world full of quirky and lovable drawings.
B00BEK6Z7M|2.0|Normally, Preston & Childs books are fascinating but this one lacked heart.  It seemed to be an almost mechanical construct; all the elements are there but it never clicked for me.  I know writing is tough so I expect messers Preston & Child to bounce back in the next installment; they have the track record to show that they can!
B00169N0BK|5.0|I own a photo printing business, and am a photographer. To finally have my system calibrated to industry standard has made a huge difference in terms of repeatibilty, and for printing what I see on my monitor accurately. It is a very easy procedure with ColorMunki.

B008JFLWLE|5.0|this app is super helpful accurate and fun to mess around on....... it helps me a lot with my homework in high school and it is very useful i use it all the time..... i think its better than a real calculator which requiers buttons unlike this amazing app
B00EE3FVSU|3.0|This is a crime drama that takes place in the tiny, closed seaside town of Broadchurch. It is a place where everyone is connected in some way and everyone knows everyone else ... or thinks they do. It begins with the murder of a local boy, but is more about the crime's effect on the people whose lives it touches than about the young victim. As is usual with BBC programming, the production is well done and the acting is good, but for some reason it didn't capture me with the first episode.
B00957T6X6|5.0|The characters are incredibly deep and the plot twists and turns better than any roller-coaster. Its well worth the money and the time. Dont miss out on this experience.
B00BWJARHO|4.0|I have always loved the story and the characters, and was surprised to find that I was not disappointed by the movie adaptation. It's exciting to me that the technology is finally available to bring my favorite fantasies to life!
B008K9SG9K|5.0|Every song is great. There music has so varied. I have been listening to music for 50 years. I believe this will rate among the best.
B00FJTYDKK|4.0|The Croods is about a family of neanderthals with a paranoid patriarch, a nagging mother-in-law, a disaffected teenaged girl, a goofy brother and an absolute terror of a baby sister. Their world is turned upside down when their cave is destroyed and they are forced to journey through an unfamiliar and frightening landscape in search of a new home. They meet a modern human, a young man who piques Eep's interest and opens their eyes to the wonders of their new world. It is a good family movie, fun for kids and adults, with an interesting plot, lots of action and enough &#34;crood&#34; humor to keep the kids giggling.
B0086449YA|5.0|Mark Knopfler continues to put out quality CD's. This one has some very good Blues.  It is great to sit back or drive to great lyrics, and interesting music with varied styles. I have most of his solo CD's and this one ranks well with his best.
159184617X|4.0|By Richard Beales<br /><br />Jonathan Ive is the British perfectionist who leads Apple’s design team. A new book about him by journalist Leander Kahney shows his huge influence uniting form and function at the U.S. tech giant. But Ive the man remains largely hidden behind a screen that’s as obsessively crafted as any of the company’s gadgets.<br /><br />Widely known and highly decorated in the design world, Ive isn’t always given his due as an architect of the company’s resurgence alongside Apple co-founder Steve Jobs. Kahney puts that right with a narrative making the case for the “genius” asserted in his subtitle.<br /><br />Although Ive’s role in the development of groundbreaking gadgets like the iPhone and iPad may have been understated, the story of those events has been told, for example in Walter Isaacson’s biography of Jobs. For that reason, these parts of Kahney’s tale are less engaging. The book is better when it focuses on Ive’s – and Apple’s – approach to industrial design.<br /><br />Visionary products were perhaps Jobs’ forte, but the company has also made its computers and mobile devices special, and this is more Ive’s bailiwick. One allure is their deceptive simplicity. Ive is a fan of Dieter Rams, the famed German designer. Rams probably deserves more than the one paragraph he gets in the book: his 10 principles of good design, including innovation and utility, could have been written specifically for Ive’s Apple.<br /><br />Ive, known as Jony (pronounced Johnny), also likes to make products inviting. Kahney recounts how, as a teenage intern at Roberts Weaver Group (RWG) in London, Ive designed a pen with a clip intended specifically to be fiddled with. Handles built into devices over the years reflect a similar desire for emotional appeal. Even the curved back of the iPad was, according to Kahney, an attempt to encourage people to pick it up.<br /><br />Sheer quality is a third element. Ive generally shuns Apple’s choreographed stage appearances. In 2008, though, he made an exception to introduce the new aluminum “unibody” laptops, pronouncing the metal with an extra “i” in the British way. The aluminum is milled, a process traditionally reserved for handmade or specialized and expensive equipment. The technique allows for great precision, reducing the number of parts and thus helping make devices smaller. Using it is, however, a huge engineering challenge for a company with production runs in the millions.<br /><br />Ive and his colleagues are heavily involved in designing the manufacturing process for Apple products, even when a contractor such as Foxconn will make them. Along with fanatical attention to matters such as surface finishes, this is an underappreciated ingredient in Apple’s secret sauce. Just as Tim Cook, Jobs’ successor as chief executive, helped construct a masterful global supply chain, Ive’s people and their engineering brethren actually know how to make products for the mass market, not just design and specify them.<br /><br />That surely owes something to Ive’s hands-on design education at Newcastle Polytechnic, now Northumbria University, in Britain. The respected program invites students to work with all kinds of materials, not just create designs in the abstract. Like his contemporaries, Ive also spent the middle part of his course interning with design firms. It was during one of these periods that he came up with the playful pen.<br /><br />What Ive is like personally is harder to discern. Like the lights that seem, through another miracle of industrial design, to wink from within the metal casing of an Apple laptop, Kahney’s book provides only glimmers.<br /><br />Ive and his family are as private as Apple. He’s a perfectionist, and prepared to fight for his design ideas. When he receives awards, Kahney says he generously recognizes his team. Still, he showed a hard edge by asking for a raise mere weeks after joining RWG – too soon, his boss had to explain. As a 23-year-old, Ive joined Tangerine Design as a partner with two much older colleagues. Kahney also cites reports in 2011 suggesting that Ive threatened to quit Apple and was offered a $55 million package to stay.<br /><br />The company’s senior vice president of design hasn’t shied away from corporate politics either. Ive won a battle that led to the 2005 ouster of his onetime boss Jon Rubinstein. Last year, Ive took over responsibilities for software as well as hardware design when Scott Forstall left the company. Yet Kahney says he has “carefully guarded his image as a soft-spoken English gentleman.”<br /><br />If the book is on target, Ive must be one of Cook’s most powerful and valuable lieutenants. But he’s elusive in Apple’s financial reports, too. He wasn’t one of the four SVPs named with the CEO as the five top executives in annual meeting documents earlier this year. That means his pay wasn’t disclosed. Nor did Ive turn up in a list of senior executives citing four additional SVPs. As of now, he’s the only member of the leadership team on Apple’s website who wasn’t named in those documents.<br /><br />Of course, just as there was more to Apple than Jobs, there’s more to the company now than Cook and Ive. Even so, Kahney’s chronicle suggests Ive, as long as he doesn’t lose his touch, is almost irreplaceable. Yet without really discovering what makes the English knight of the realm tick, it’s hard to ascertain what – if anything – might persuade him to leave.<br /><br />The author is a Reuters Breakingviews columnist. The opinions expressed are his own.<br />Read more at [...]<br />[...]o soon, his boss had to explain. As a 23-year-old, Ive joined Tangerine Design as a partner with two much older colleagues.

B003O86FMW|4.0|It is necessary for the story line, but it is definitely not as amazing as the first in the series.
B00AQ71FLK|5.0|the multiplayer mode is frickin' awesome. i love this game. very similar to league of legends. i love playing with other people. matchmaking works very well.

B00AREIAI8|5.0|Good way to pass time, I ride so some of it is interesting with accuracy n whatnot. Just something to do.
B000I9VOO4|5.0|TIMELESS. As long as we are human beings living on this planet, this movie will remain relevant.  The film gods must have sprinkled it with star dust because it is magical. I see the word 'dated' being used a lot these days. I suspect by young people or immature adults who are not bright enough to understand a period piece film within it's 'time' context. This movie transcends time. It's not about time or anything like that. Every actor is relevant. Every scene relevant. The action and the plot flow. But more importantly, it sends a timeless message.<br /><br />The actor who played &#34;Bob Ewell&#34; James K Anderson, was hand-picked by Director Robert Mulligan. It's quoted someplace where he told Mulligan, 'I can play this character. I know him.' pretty chilling. And Robert Duvall is unforgettable as Boo Radley and he never says a word.<br /><br />I wager this movie will remain important in the year 2525!
B008RA3X5E|4.0|Love this application use it every day for my clock before I go to bed and rise in the morning..<br />It is worth the extra coins for full package
B00E8KLWB4|5.0|I have just started playing but so far this is a very entertaining and fun game. I tend to like game that require me to search and find. This has been a challenge ing one. Worth the money and could play without having to spend more money to advance further. I give it 5 stars.
B002SSUQFG|4.0|I wanted a small unobtrusive watch that didn't require a battery.  The last thing I wanted was a watch that quits on me in the back country.  This watch is all that and more.  I don't mind adjusting the time once a week (looses about two minutes a week).  I've snorkled with it and had it in a lot of different environments around the world and it's been a real jewel.  It's affordable & dependable.  I'm glad I quit buying those $9.99 watches afraid of breaking a good watch and purchased this watch because it has done everything I expected it to.
B009JZSC9S|5.0|The Good Wife always have hidden surprises along the way.  I Highly recommed it if someone need something to watch on a wintery day.
B00CNQ7HAU|5.0|But engaging and thoughtful nonetheless.  I have read nearly all of Grisham novels and I still fell in love with Jake Brigance again.
B00FAPF5U0|5.0|Just happy to finally see it on the Kindle Fire! Its exactly the same game and able to connect with facebook. Its great!
B00190OHD6|5.0|As a widow, this story helps me cope only because it is told/acted in such a way that I smile at the parts of each character played with such good taste and humor.
B0045XKJBI|5.0|My wife is really into this movie... she loves it.  I actually thought it was pretty good too.  If you haven't seen it, give it a try.
B004I8WD7S|5.0|Amazon makes great iphone cases. They allow for the phone to face downward on a surface, yet, not scratch or damage the screen because of the beveled edges.<br /><br />I highly recommend.

B003O86FMW|5.0|Wow, I didn't think I was going to like the Hunger Games series of books since they are mostly for young adults.  I started the 1st one and immediately got hooked.  Bought the 2nd and 3rd on Kindle and finished all of them in one week.  Can't wait for the movie to come out.  What awesome stories!
B00EMAGCJM|1.0|If you like garbage music, which many of you do, buy this album.  Waste your money.  You don't deserve to have it or ears either.  The people that have made Miley famous are the same ones leading the way to IDIOCRACY.
1423170148|5.0|Beautifully written and illustrated.  A must for any girl.  Can't wait to give it to my granddaughter and watch her reaction.  Great book.
B00EW9GQR6|1.0|Bubble gum pop at its worst.  Each album she/it puts out is worse than the last.  Can't wait to see how bad the next release is.
B005ZOBNOI|5.0|Warning: do not read this book in public.<br /><br />One of the better young adult novels written in the last 15-20 years.<br />John Green knows how to tug on the heart strings.
B00F8GYC1Y|5.0|my kids really like this game.  Each bird behaves differently from how the classic birds behave, which is likely part of the fun.
B005HJ6MRO|1.0|It asks for a security number and provides on in an email but the website will not accept alpha characters which is what they provided. I tread calling customer service to straighten this out when I had imagined the process would be seamless. Eventually Ill call but it is time I had not anticipated having to spend.
B007URVZJ6|5.0|I use this every time I format another book for Kindle. It is a roadmap to getting the desired results.
0399536108|5.0|This should mandatory reading for every young person. Most people spend their whole life trying to adjust to this sick society. And they wonder why they are never happy and contented.
B00DWZHTRW|4.0|Great plot great movie it was never boring Twist after twist leaves you guessing for the duration of the movie until the epic ending
B007J4T2G8|4.0|But I loved the plot. I think that this is a book that most women can relate to in some aspect.
B000078DOI|5.0|Before their transformation by uber producer Rick Rubin, I can say although their music was not as potent as it is today it still had its moments and Mothers Milk is testament.<br /><br />After regrouping after the death of guitarist Hilel Slovak and the departure of drummer Jack Irons, Anthony Kiedis and Flea regroup with new drummer Chad Smith and guitarist John Frusciante and this album is the result.<br /><br />Although Blood Sugar Sex Magik is my favorite Chili Pepper album, I think this is their best album that was not produced by Rubin. I also like the fact that this version of this album also has bonus tracks.<br /><br />Try this album.
0307275639|5.0|If you like Mitch Albom,you will love this.Never been disappointed by Mr. Albom.Great writing,great message.This is one of his best.(loved em' all).

B0002VEPRQ|5.0|This classic film has something for every age group, and I get something new from it every time I see it. I highly recommend it.
B008O5NH2Q|5.0|This is a book to be read and re-read every month, as a reminder of what we should be thinking all day long, at all times, even when going to sleep. Similar reading as in Think and Grow Rich.
B00005JKNF|5.0|This is one of my favorite films. The plot is so intricate that one has to see it a few times before catching onto all the clues. It would be prohibitive to see the film so many times in a theatre, so the DVD is a great investment.
B00DAPOHU6|5.0|..just enjoyable...intent revealed...insighful......a good listen......rounds out a collection of ecclectic music....give it a go....looked foward to new material.....a delightful listen
B00004WG2F|5.0|The film is a wonderful depiction of the WWI era, with beauty interlaced with tragedy. Though the setting is in Canada, it is so much like the American West.

B00A8307BG|5.0|I have had this cd on continuous loop in my truck for 3 weeks now. Robin shows what a true master he is, his playing is right on never over played or confusing. A real tribute to the mature master he has become. This quickly became one of my all time favorites.
B00BD99JMW|3.0|The book was slow, anti-climatic with a depressing ending. The other books in this series were much better almost wish I did not read this one,
B00F3VOL38|2.0|I was really amped up when I seen they were going to release live from the bbc vol 2, I even pre ordered. I really enjoyed the first one it has some awesome tracks, real raw and a great historic feel to it so I was hoping vol 2 would be a continuation ofof where vol 1 left off. Well I have listened to the entire 2 disc and the should have named it not quite more of the same and not near as good. If you already own the first one save your money this is mostly the scraps that weren't good enough to make the first cut. Vol 2 grasping at straws would have been a better title

B002LHTRV8|5.0|I was never a fan of Johhny Depp or the Pirates of Carribean series. Changed my opinion after watching this movie. Full of surprises.
